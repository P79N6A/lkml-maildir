Hi,
I went bridgeing today, and all went fine.
Until I cat /proc/net/bridge.
There are no Oops or whatever. The bug seems worse:
cat /proc/net/bridge did this to me:
- Just a core dump of cat
- Immediately logged out, and the tty can not be used anymore to log in
(it still allows you to enter you account name)
- Sort a hosed my X.
An other thing is the brcfg that is not RH6/glibc-2.1.1/2.2.9 ready.
I had to fix some include files for that.
Now it works great!
So the only bug is the cat /proc/net/bridge
I got like more than 256 MAC's on the net on one side, and a single MAC
on another (out of 5 on a $800 NETpc ;).
I remember something like a 4k /proc limit, but I guess that is not a problem
anymore.
Anyway, will look into it this weekend some more.
Regards,
Ard
