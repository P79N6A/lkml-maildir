Nope.
The US Government considers this kind of crypto hook the same as exporting
crypto.  (Kind of the way that some religions equate lusting after a woman the
same as adultry.  Allowing crypto into your source is the same as encrypting in

The Apache group has run into the same problem.  They tried the above approach
and still had a visit from the TLA who shall not be named.
