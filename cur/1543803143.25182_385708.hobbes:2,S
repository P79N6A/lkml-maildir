Actually, this doesn't look to be the correct thing to do.  The
dma_map/unmap don't make the data coherent with respect to the user
space, only with respect to the kernel space.  I've never liked this
(and indeed I wrote an OLS paper in 2004 trying to explain how we could
fix it) but that's our current model.
Our classic path for data on machines is that the driver makes the
kernel coherent and then whatever's transferring from the page cache to
the user makes user space coherent.  It sounds, therefore, like
whatever's broken (what is the problem, by the way?) is broken in the
second half (page cache to user) not in the first half (driver to
kernel).
