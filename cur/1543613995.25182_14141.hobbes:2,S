    Hi all :))
>You are close - he uses "MiB" as short for "mebi" - Mega-binary.
    Personally I don't like very much the abbreviations, but I must
recognize that they remove all possible ambiguity for the
Configure.help. With MiB, GiB, etc... you're completely sure that you
are talking about 2^20, 2^30 and not 10^6, 10^9, etc...
    So I think that is a good idea in general to use that
abbreviations for the binary units. Moreover, it's official and
correct use. Eric made a sensible decision here.
