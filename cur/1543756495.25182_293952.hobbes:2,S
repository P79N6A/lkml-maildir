Hmmm, I thought that several other systems had similar (or worse)
overhead -- most notably that bk and darcs have no real notion of a
"repository", but always store the entire history in every source tree.
Such a model seems to simplify the user interface in some cases, but
obviously can impact disk usage...
However I have no real experience with either bk or darcs; please
correct me if I'm wrong about this.
[This is as opposed to arch, which has a repository (local/remote)
model, and allows even repositories to contain only deltas from some
other repository.]
