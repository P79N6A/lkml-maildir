Hi, if you can send me your /proc/acpi/dsdt, I might be able to help. 
As your machine doesn't boot in ACPI, I can see this might be a problem. Maybe 
setting "CPU Enumeration only" in the ACPI config will let it boot?
If not, grab a copy of 
http://people.freebsd.org/~takawata/pacpidump.tar.gz
It can extract it without the need to have ACPI enabled.
