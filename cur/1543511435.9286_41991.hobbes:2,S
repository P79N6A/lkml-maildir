Unfortunately, your message violates the acceptable usage of the
trademark of the operating system we all use (L*N*X).  Using the
term without prior permission in writing from Mr. Torvalds can
carry steep penalties.  Quoting the term (as I've done by quoting
your message) is ok, however using it on anything new, is
strictly forbidden unless you obtain permission from Linus.
I hope his lawyers don't have a field day with you...
Good luck.
