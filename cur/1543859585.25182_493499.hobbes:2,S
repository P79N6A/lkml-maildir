Hi kernel experts,
	I'm a newbie to linux kernel.
 I need to take the sk buffer and directly pass to the
application which is in the user space.
 How can i do it (my project want to read data packets from driver and give
 it to application without the help of socket mechanism.)  I saw that there
 is a system call  skb_copy_datagram_iovec() which can be used to send skb to
 userspace. Can i use it? Can anyone please help me by giving a procedure to
 implement this...
Thanks in advance,
regards,
vimal
