Ah, a bug then.

I was looking at the x86 implementation to help me narrow down the possible
source of a bug I'm seeing in the driver. I noticed the driver was examining a
DMA buffer without unmapping or syncing. Before I went to the work to fix the
code I wanted to see if those operations were no-ops on the platform I'm testing
on. I'll definitely fix the driver regardless, but I didn't want to blame the
lockup on it if unmapping won't actually change anything on this platform. Thus
my confusion upon seeing pci_unmap_*() and pci_dma_sync_*() differ.

Absolutely. It does that job very well and I am greatly appreciative for the
code groveling time that document has saved me. Kudos to you and others who
spent time writing it.
