See previous message as why we don't want to allow this.

It shouldn't.  An unmodified kernel has check_mnt to keep you from doing 
this.

Again, check_mnt won't let this happen.
Another limitation is that manipulating mounts in another namespace 
breaks namespace->list locking..    Add that to a todo list if you still 
think this is a good idea.
