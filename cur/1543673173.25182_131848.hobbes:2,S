Sure. So the monitorer starts up, attempts to watch a pid, gets an error saying
that it doesn't exist, and handles it.
In the particular case that I'm planning for, the processes in question are 
long-running ones which should never die except for upgrades (which could be 
designed for).
The general case would be trickier.
