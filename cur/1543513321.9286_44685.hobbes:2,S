I see, you want to flush rulesm rather than tables.

Yes. "ip rule flush" does not exist and you have to make "ip rule list"
to delete rules. All the information to delete the rule is printed
via ip rule list, so that you need not to reboot.
The reason for this inconvenience is big mistake in design of rule list,
explained in docs. I hesitate whether to fix it in "ip" or in the kernel
until now...
