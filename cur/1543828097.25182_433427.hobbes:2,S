That would add too much overhead on small systems. It's better to be 
able to share the pools. vgetcpu allows that.

- The heap for small allocations is shared (although this can be tuned) 
- When another thread does free() you need special handling to keep
the item in the correct free lists
This is one of the tricky bits in the new kernel NUMA slab allocator
too.

That's too costly to do by default and you have no guarantee that it will amortize.

I see no indication of anything better so far from you. You only offered
static configuration instead which while in some cases is better
doesn't work in the general case.
