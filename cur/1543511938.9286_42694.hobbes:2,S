That's good to hear.

I don't run the 2.3 kernels myself, but I'll have a look in the syslog
on my 2.2.12 system later this evening when I get home, and see if the
same is happenning there.
One obvious question though: Was /dev/loop0 already in use when you
did that? I've always used simply "-o loop" which uses the first
unused loop device, so have no idea what happens if one tries to reuse
one that's already in use.
One thing to remember is that if one used `mount -o loop` then the
relevant `umount` command will automatically clear the loop devicxe as
well, but if one does the losetup separately, then the `umount` does
not clear the loop device afterwards.

That would tend to indicate that the problem is not a kernel bug, but
some sort of synchronisation problem with the loop devices.

Very true. Can you try the following and see if that also produces
wads of syslog messages please?
 Q> dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=4000 of=/tmp/looptest
 Q> mke2fs /tmp/looptest
 Q> mount -o loop /tmp/looptest /mnt
The results will probably help to locate the problem, when compared
with your earlier results.

Unless I'm mistaken, the default RedHat startup script will use MORE
CPU cycles with the symlink in place than without, since it still
tries to write to the file, and has to handle the "Read-only file"
errors resulting from doing so, which it wouldn't have had to handle
otherwise...
