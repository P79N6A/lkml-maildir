I've discovered that heavy use of vesafb can be a major source of clock
drift on my system, especially if I don't specify "ypan" or "ywrap". On my
system (similar Hw/Sw configuration to yours), a 2.4 kernel "make dep"
from a vesafb console will cause the system clock to drift 10-12 seconds.
With "ywrap", I can do an entire kernel build and only loose 5 seconds or
so. Even with "ywrap", the drift causes ntpd to loose synchronization. If
I build the kernel from an xterm window, ntpd does not loose sync and
there is no apparent clock drift.
The video on this system is an onboard ATI 3D Rage LT Pro; I use vesafb
rather than atyfb because the latter screws up X.
