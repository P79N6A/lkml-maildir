Finally, after too many delays, I am pleased to announce the release of my
driver for 3Com's 3cr990 family of network cards.
This initial release is endian clean, tested on x86 and sparc64, and does
 - NAPI
 - Zerocopy Tx
 - TCP segmentation
 - Hardware VLAN accel
It does *not* do IPSEC crypto offload as of yet. I have a version for the 2.4
series of kernels, but it is an ugly, ugly kludge, and would be shot if seen
in public. I will be working on integrating the hardware with the IPSEC
support in 2.5.x.
There are a few issues with the firmware -- DMA to a 2 byte aligned address
hangs the firmware, so we cannot easily align the IP header, and the firmware
will always strip the VLAN tags on packet reception, regardless of our
desires. I hope to work with 3Com to resolve these issues.

I'd like to thank 3Com's engineers for finding me documentation and putting up
with my questions, and my project manager for navigating the bureaucracy so
that this work may see public use. I couldn't have received a better going
away present on my last day on the job.
Enjoy!
