Frequently wrong.  Depending on the interface, ROM can be just
unbelievably slow.

The right thing for you to do is to write a block device driver, and
then mount that block device like any order device.  Your in-use data
will be copied to RAM (i.e. cached), but it can be dropped and
re-fetched as necessary.  This should be the desired behaviour.
