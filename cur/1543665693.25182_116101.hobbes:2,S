But, you can do exactly the same with just a few added lines in the 
ieee1394 core - just have a wrapper that calls ->remove() (in the 1394 
device structure), then calls device_unregister() for the device.
Your ->remove() can do anything you like, including removing all the 
children, much as I assume it does now. So, behavior is exactly as you 
want, and it keeps it out of the core for now. 
I much prefer this, as I would like to see it eventually, but I'd rather
see the implications worked out before it's generalized.
Thanks,
