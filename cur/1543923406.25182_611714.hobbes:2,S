Linus, please pull the latest scheduler git tree from:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched.git
it contains 7 commits: 3 (small) fixes, 1 code cleanup and 3 style 
cleanups - all fallout of recent merges.
[ There is one commit that is borderline for post-rc1 inclusion: "sched:
  report CPU usage in CFS cgroup directories" which completes/fixes 
  cgroup CPU accounting by introducing a small piece of new code. It's 
  only relevant to cgroups which is a new feature in 2.6.24 so there are 
  no regression/compatibility worries, so i included it. ]
Thanks,
	Ingo
