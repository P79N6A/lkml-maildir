Greetings Module Wizards:
If I attempt to use modules to load the SCSI code, not just the device
modules, but the required modules listed in
                  /usr/src/linux/Documentation/scsi.txt
I am apparently unable to control the order in which the modules are
loaded via initrd. It looks as though they are loaded in alphabetical
order, no matter what the order listed in /etc/conf.modules. This
prevents scsi_mod.o from being loaded first, which is a required
condition shown in the cited documentation. The result is a kernel
panic with unresolved symbols upon boot.
I have been using the Red Hat script, `makinitrd` to create the new
RAM Disc image for inclusion by lilo.
If I compile scsi_mod into the kernel, i.e., CONFIG_SCSI=y, everything
works. I thought I could cheat and rename
                /lib/modules/2.2.3/scsi/scsi_mod.o
             to /lib/modules/2.2.3/scsi/0scsi_mod.o
so it would appear first in a directory listing (I changed the alias
of scsi_host_adapter also). This did nothing but compound the problem.
Apparently some code 'knows' what the correct name of the module is supposed
to be without reference to the aliases.
This is /usr/src/linux/.config
CONFIG_SCSI=m
Plus other SCSI modules
This is /etc/conf.modules
# Aliases
alias scsi_hostadapter scsi_mod
alias scsi_hostadapter sg 
alias scsi_hostadapter sd_mod
alias scsi_hostadapter aic7xxx
alias block-major-8 sd_mod
alias char-major-21 sg
[ unrelated stuff snipped ]
So, it seems that the basic SCSI module can't be loaded upon boot. It
has to be included in the kernel if you intend to boot from a SCSI
disk.
This was discovered while attempting to make a 'generic' boot disk
that will boot practically everything, all kinds of IDE drives, and
all kinds of SCSI drives. This generic disk works if I keep the
basic SCSI module within the kernel.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
