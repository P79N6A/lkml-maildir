These are a bit different classes. One is a generic input device class
device. Then you have several class device interfaces (evdev,
mousedev, joydev, tsdev, keyboard) that together with generic input
device produce concrete input devices (mouse, js, ts) that you have
implemented with class_simple.
At least that's the picture I had in my mind at some point.
