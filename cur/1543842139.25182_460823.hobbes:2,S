You can call schedule with the BKL held. But schedule will release the
BKL before the process is put to sleep. To use a lock as mechanism to
prevent double frees of discarded pages you'd have to hold it while
sleeping.

The PG_locked bit which is behind lock_page() is used for a different
purpose. Look at the way how e.g. find_lock_page works: the radix tree
lookup is made, a reference is acquired with page_cache_get() and then
__lock_page() is called. For the discard double page free prevention we
need to lock the page, then wait for all referenced to be returned. Only
then can we unlock the page again. These two uses are mutual exclusive.

Uhh, that is even more invasive than the things we do now.
page_cache_get() alias get_page() is just concerned about reference
counting. You definitly do not want to do state changes in
get_page/put_page. That would increase the number state changes by an
order of magnitude.

Where does this help? All places that have "mapping == page->mapping"
either don't care about the page state or work on stable pages.

Hmm, we can reduce the number of page_host_discards() checks in the VM
code if PageDiscarded() and friends are defined conditionally on
CONFIG_PAGE_STATES. I'm not sure if all calls to page_host_discards()
can be removed but I will take a look at it. It would be a real
improvement to get rid of most of these calls.

It would make the code simpler but the cost would be additional state
changes. For example whenever you free a page you would do a state
transition from volatile to stable shortly followed by a state
transition from stable to unused. These states changes have a cost that
we want to avoid.

I'm a little confused about this suggestion. If I understood it
correctly you want to block a number of pages and use a seqlock per
block to indicate if there is a discarded page in that block of pages.
On discard you do write_seqlock and force the read_seqlock side if the
lock could to be acquired to traverse a list before they can conclude
that a page is not discarded. 
First question: where are the list_heads stored that are used to put
pages on the special list? They have to be allocated somewhere, per
discarded page. I do not think that you can do it lazy, that is after a
discard fault happened. You have to preallocate them and then you are
spending 16 byte per discardable page instead of 1 bit.
Second question: how do you deal with multiple discards for a block of
pages? The first sets the write_seqlock, how is the write_sequnlock
done? After a discarded page has been freed you need to check if there
is another discarded page in the block, or if a discard is in progress.
This sounds racy.
I do not think that the locking with a seqlock will work. But please
keep throwing ideas at me. The point about page_host_discards is valid.
