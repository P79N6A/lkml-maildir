POSIX AIO needs to handle SIGEV_NONE, SIGEV_SIGNAL and SIGEV_THREAD
notification.  Obviously kernel shouldn't create threads for SIGEV_THREAD
itself, as kernel shouldn't hardcode all the implementation details how a
thread can be created.  But it would be good if AIO signalling e.g. handled
both SIGEV_SIGNAL and SIGEV_SIGNAL | SIGEV_THREAD_ID, with the same usage as
e.g. timer_* syscalls.  If kernel makes sure SI_ASYNCIO si_code is set in
the notification signal siginfos, glibc could even use just one helper
thread for timer_*/[al]io_* and maybe in the future other SIGEV_THREAD notification.
