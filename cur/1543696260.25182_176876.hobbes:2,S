If you look at asm/types.h, u64 is kernel only namespace, so in
theory that code will not be in userspace.  Also, the whole idea
of this patch (the first one that touched byteorder.h, and not the
second that touched types.h), was to encase everything that used
__u64 that _is_ in userspace in __STRICT_ANSI__.  If there thus
was another place that did use __u64 outside a ifdef __STRICT_ANSI__,
the compile would anyhow stop with -ansi.
Your above example would thus look more like:
--
#if defined(__GNUC__) && !defined(__STRICT_ANSI__)
static inline __u32 swab_foo(__u32 a, __u32 b)
{
	__u64 tmp = ((__u64)a<<32) | ((__u64)b);
	__u32 retval;
	retval = compute(tmp);
	return retval;
}
#else
<code without __u64>
..
#endif
--
which in theory should not have an issue.
