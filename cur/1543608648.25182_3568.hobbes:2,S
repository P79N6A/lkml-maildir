   FWIW me too, on an 8-way 8.5GB (64GB HIGHMEM enabled) IBM Netfinity 
x370 (8500R) which functions as a production mail server.  I currently 
run 2.4.9 with XFS and it stays up for about a week under heavy load. 
2.4.13 lasted about 4 hours under light load until all memory was 
consumed by cache then it became unresponsive.
   2.4.13 on a 2-way 1GB (64GB HIGHMEM enabled) Netfinity x350 test box 
with the same kernel config and XFS works fine even under stress, so 
perhaps our problem is similar to the discussion on l-k "Google's mm 
problems"...
   Anything I can do to help please ask.
Jim
