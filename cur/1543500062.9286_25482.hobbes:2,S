hm, i thought we want to protect preallocated blocks and other 'on the
fly' nonpersistent inode-metadata with the inode semaphore, so we can
later on remove the big kernel lock _and_ the per-filesystem superblock
lock without worrying too much. Now we rely on the superblock semaphore
alone, which is correct but more coarse grained than the inode semaphore i
think. I'm happy with this change nevertheless, my original patch that got
rid of the write semaphore did exactly what we do now, i was just unsure
wether it's correct ;)

cool :)
