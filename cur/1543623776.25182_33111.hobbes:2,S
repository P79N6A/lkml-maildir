PS. I've got a rather good grip of my Linux From Scratch system - with a BSD style init for even better control - and only load modules for one NIC and ALSA stuff here. Never have had file systems modulari(z)(s)ed DS.

Silly :-) A P166 needs every boost possible. Yes, I have preempt enabled. And yes, you are right on the mark. Compiling without preempt the booting of 2.5.6-pre3 runs flawlessly. And after a few tests no file corruption visible. But 2.5.6-pre2 + preempt-UP-bug-patch worked like a charm. So there's something else involved, it seems.
During the compilation I happened to get a brief glimpse of a warning in ide.c Don't know C so can't evaluate its severity. Went something like this: 'In function choose_drive Warning: distinkt pointer lacks a cast'.

I judge it a moot point to dump all those lines now. If I'm in err, nudge me.
Thanks for the discussion.
