Thank you for checking, it made me try 2.6.6 and I still see the same 
problem.
The good news is, the problem does not happen on a virtual console, only 
in X. In fact, I narrowed it down to radeon_drv.o in X11 from RedHat 9. 
After replacing just that file with the one from a recent Debian 
machine, the problem went away.
Both modules report the same version (4.0.1), but were compiled for 
slightly different X distributions (4.3.0 in RedHat vs 4.3.0.1 in Debian).
