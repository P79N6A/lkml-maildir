We never do list_del twice, nor we do list_del on unitialized inodes!

ok. But now I hope I proved that it's ok?
no one does list_del() twice and no one does list_del() on unitialized 
inodes.
If you want i_sb_list to be really ALWAYS initialized than we can 
replace list_del with list_del_init and insert INIT_LIST_HEAD(i_sb_list) 
in inode_init_once().
But I don't think it's a good idea.
Moreover, I think that list_del_init() and other initialization 
functions of link list_heads in such places usually only hide the 
problems, not solve them.
