well, the open case, IMHO is handled by the
lookup_create() modifications, truncate is something
I obviously missed (I missed the intermezzo copies 
too ;) and metadata changes were intentionally ignored
(it's the first try, and I'm glad that you see it as 
a step in the right direction?)

will add the truncate() case soon, maybe it is also
possible to move some parts of the may_create
function to the mnt_may_create (any suggestions for
a better name?), to avoid doing some checks twice ...
any further suggestions?
