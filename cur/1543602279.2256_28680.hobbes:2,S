   Watch ifr.ifr_name.
Hi Ken, I believe there is some bug in your new checker algorithms for
this case.
                   struct ifreq ifr;
                   int err;
   Start--->
                   if (copy_from_user(&ifr, (void *)arg, sizeof(ifr)))
                           return -EFAULT;
                   ifr.ifr_name[IFNAMSIZ-1] = '\0';
ifreq copied safely to kernel space, ifr.ifr_name[] is inside the
struct and NOT a user pointer.
                   err = tun_set_iff(file, &ifr);
Pass address of kernel ifreq.
                   if (*ifr->ifr_name)
                           name = ifr->ifr_name;
   
                   if ((err = dev_alloc_name(&tun->dev, name)) < 0)
                           goto failed;
Perfectly fine still, name always points to kernel memory.
   
   int dev_alloc_name(struct net_device *dev, const char *name)
   {
 ...
           for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
   Error--->
   	       sprintf(buf,name,i);
Still fine, as stated "name" is pointing to kernel memory.
Perhaps your code is being confused by "ifreq->if_name" being
an array.
Franks a lot,
