OK, let me try a brief history.  A while ago Eric pointed out that the
smp ops patch in -mm would break voyager.  So we worked on (and tested a
fix for it).  Part of the fix was the prerequisite patch "i386: move
common parts of smp into their own file".  The fix on top of this was
called "i386: fix voyager build" which actually fixed the voyager build.
I've been nagging Andi for a couple of weeks now to get these two
upstream.  Finally he replied that the he wasn't planning on sending the
precursor "i386: move common parts of smp into their own file" upstream
for 2.6.22.  So I had to do a patch that would fix the voyager build
without this ... which is what you have.
So, you either need the single patch you have, or the other two entitled
"i386: move common parts of smp into their own file".
"i386: fix voyager build"
