Andre hi.
All the scsi calls do not need any locks. The scsi LLDS never
see these threads since commands are queued through the block
layer.
What's left is what you see, here in sg.c. you must have the best 
knowledge about the possible races between ioctl and open/release
and probe/remove. And all these put_user() copy_user() etc...
Why don't you have a hard look and fix them properly.
please don't *lock_kernel();* for scsi's sake. Also note that
sg is not a scsi device it is a block device. It used to Q commands
directly to scsi but it does not do that any more.
Again I think SCSI neto is safe and tested. My $0.02.
