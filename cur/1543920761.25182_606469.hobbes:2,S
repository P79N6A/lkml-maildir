Hi David,
I just tried out mmc_spi on Linux HEAD and it no longer works. :/
It seems to be caused by changes in the SPI core on how to handled bus
sharing. All I'm getting in dmesg is this:
[17179577.832000] mmc_spi spi1.0: can't share SPI bus
[17179577.836000] mmc_spi: probe of spi1.0 failed with error -31
Ideas? This platform worked fine with 2.6.23-rc*
Rgds
