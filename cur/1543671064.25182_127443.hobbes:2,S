We're basically already at that point. IIRC, I've read an article about
something called "Super-DMCA" which prevents you (beside other things) to
build up "systems" that could scrambl/encrypt sounds for pretected
transmission (think VoIP over ssh or something like that in hardware).
Even right now, you don't simply have (everywhere on this globe) the
right to build a simple piece of hardware protecting your phone calls...
This said, it _may_ even be illegal from this point of view to create a
"new" general-purpose computer as it could be used for this purpose.
Though, IANAL.
