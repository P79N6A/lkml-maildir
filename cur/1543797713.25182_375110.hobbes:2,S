This is the trace we needed.
That last line is impossible, the debugging of the last 3 lines shows
that:
1) "page" is equal to 0x2000
2) "map_size" is equal to 0x2000
Furthermore, the first line shows that:
3) "vma->vm_start" is 0x71800000
The io_remap_pfn_range() call in drivers/video/sbuslib.c is:
		r = io_remap_pfn_range(vma,
					vma->vm_start + page,
					MK_IOSPACE_PFN(iospace,
						map_offset >> PAGE_SHIFT),
					map_size,
					vma->vm_page_prot);
This means, it passes in "vma->vm_start + page" in as the start
address.
Yet the last line, printed by the tracing code in io_remap_pfn_range()
is getting 0x71800000, when it should be 0x71802000.
I strongly believe your kernel is being miscompiled by whatever
gcc is being used to build your kernels.
