Hi Matthieu.
Can you please try to tell what your patch actually does.
As for the part added in the MAkefile you pass -lintl for Cygwin -
but I fail to see _why_ -lintl is needed.
The patch to check-lxdialog.sh is outdated.
Could I ask you to redo it againt latest version and again explains
the _why_ part. The how part is obvious from the diff...
Do not get me worg. I would love to have Cygwin supported but I want
it in the cleanest possible way.
	Sam
