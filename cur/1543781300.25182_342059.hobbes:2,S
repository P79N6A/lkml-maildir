Every variable has a value.  In this case, they start off as PORT_UNKNOWN
as expected.

I don't follow you here - failure of this function is not dependent on
port.type being PORT_UNKNOWN.

Again I don't follow you here.
The only reason serial8250_find_match_or_unused() will return NULL is
if all registered port entries correspond with real hardware ports.
In that case, the solution is to increase the number of 8250 ports
via the kernels configuration.

They're set to something other than PORT_UNKNOWN when a port is
discovered via serial8250_register_port() / uart_add_one_port().
