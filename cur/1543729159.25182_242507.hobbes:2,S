Here are the additional commands I permit right now. It allows me to blank
a CDRW and record in TAO mode. k3b needs MODE_SELECT_10  even
for read-only access.
		safe_for_read(GPCMD_GET_CONFIGURATION),
		safe_for_read(GPCMD_GET_PERFORMANCE),
		safe_for_read(MODE_SELECT_10),
		safe_for_write(ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL),
		safe_for_write(REZERO_UNIT),
		safe_for_write(SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE),
		safe_for_write(GPCMD_SET_SPEED),
		safe_for_write(GPCMD_SEND_OPC),
		safe_for_write(GPCMD_BLANK),
		safe_for_write(GPCMD_CLOSE_TRACK),
		safe_for_write(0x5c), //whatever this might be
Shouldn't most GPCMD_* commands be safe for reading or writing, at least
for CD devices?
Are commands like MODE_SELECT_10 really safe for read?
