What are you after here?
If you read the inital post you see the actual savings and you also
can read that it works wiht modules. The precentage can be calculated
from these numbers if you are interested.
As explained later this patch does NOT remove exported symbols
since they may be used by modules that are not included in the actual
build.
And the patch works for x86_64.
So I'm a bit puzzeled what you are trying to bring forward here.
And please read carefully the initial posting again...
