I've come across something that I'm not sure Kconfig can do but I'll
explain what I need and see what others can come up with...
The DRM has a weak dependency on AGP, it does not require AGP for all
situations but can use it in most...
So what I want to do and what I think Kbuild can't do is:
if CONFIG_AGP=n then CONFIG_DRM can be n,m,y
if CONFIG_AGP=m then CONFIG_DRM can be m but not y
if CONFIG_AGP=y then CONFIG_DRM can be m,y
This also needs to work for oldconfigs if it can be enforced, so someone
who has a valid config now of CONFIG_AGP=m, CONFIG_DRM=y will be
questioned...
I'm thinking I could change the name of CONFIG_DRM to CONFIG_DRM_CORE and
just use the default rules, if the worst comes to the worst...
Dave.
