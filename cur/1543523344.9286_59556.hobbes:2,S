Hi all,
thank you very much for your good and quick answers. I had access to the
two Linux boxes today, so my answer is so late.

It didn't. The manpage concentrates a little bit on IDE, so it may
(or may not) be the reason that I use SCSI. I hope this info is of some
value for you.

This was the solution. As util-linux 2.10 seems to be very fresh, I got the
source, compiled it and used only the blockdev binary. This one flushed
the right kernel buffers, and now, my problem is solved.
Again, thanks for the quick help.
