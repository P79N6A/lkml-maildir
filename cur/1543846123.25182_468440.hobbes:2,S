Ah, I should have read the whole thread before replying. I have not 
read the code, but... In your original mail you mention it adds a 
new "lcddisplay" class. I think this wants to be called "auxdisplay".
For the device drivers, you could just use either the acronym alone or
write it out, i.e., just use: cfag12864b Liquid Crystal Display driver, 
or (as stolen from that url) CFAG12864B Series Standard Graphic LCD 
driver.
Good luck,
Alexander
