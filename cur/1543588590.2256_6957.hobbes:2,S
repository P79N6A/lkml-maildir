Mine is attached. I always run "make menuconfig", reconfirm my
selections (which haven't changed in ages), save it, and then run "make
dep" before building. I should note that I'm using a version of the DRI
from CVS from early April, but it has been perfectly happy until now. I
also tried it with the code in the kernel tree, same problem.
