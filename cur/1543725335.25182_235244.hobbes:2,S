Does this scale in a linear fashion with respect to CPU speed?  You
mentioned you were testing on a 2Ghz machine, does 700 usecs on that
translate to 2800 usecs on a 500Mhz box?
On a 2Ghz machine, 700 usecs is about one million CPU cycles.  In other
words, the highest priority process can become runnable, then have to
wait *one million cycles* to get the CPU.
How much I/O do you allow to be in flight at once?  It seems like by
decreasing the maximum size of I/O that you handle in one interrupt you
could improve this quite a bit.  Disk throughput is good enough, anyone
in the real world who would feel a 10% hit would just throw hardware at
the problem.
