I feel trying to keep two notions of time, one in the timeofday code and
one in the timer code is the real issue. Trying to better keep them
synced will just lead to madness. Instead the timer subsystem needs to
move to using monotonic_clock(), or get_lowres_timestamp() instead of
using jiffies for its notion of time. Jiffies is just an interrupt
counter. 
This somewhat ignores the fact that we're discussing a "jiffies
timesource", which I only implemented as a lowest common denominator /
if you really don't have anything better / thanks the academy for its'
worst time source ever award/ simple example of the timesource code.
More and more I think I need a t-shirt that reads "jiffies ain't time".
thanks
