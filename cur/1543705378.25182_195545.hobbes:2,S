Shouldn't these things be autodetected?
"alias usb-controller" is a poor example.  Shouldn't the kernel
automatically load drivers for all USB controllers that are found?
(On my system, there's more than one type, which makes "alias
usb-controller" even uglier).
"alias eth1" may be necessary to bind discovered NICs with the right
interface names, but it's unfortunate.  One system where I had "alias
eth0 ..."  failed to boot after a kernel upgrade when the named driver
no longer supported that network card (a different driver took over
support).
