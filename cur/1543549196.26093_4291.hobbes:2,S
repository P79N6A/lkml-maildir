Hi Tigran!
Sorry for the delay, I'm now finishing up for my final exams, so I get to
answering my mail once per day if I'm lucky.

This fix is wrong -- the scanning of cardbus devices is done inside the cardbus
driver itself, the PCI layer should only allocate the bus. If you force the
scanning, it will work for devices present during system boot, but not if you
remove the card and insert it again.
Anyway, can you send me your /proc/ioports and /proc/iomem, please?
				Have a nice fortnight
