hi ingo,
my bad - sorry. it was some other stupid change of mine to the kernel [i.e 
not a fresh kernel] which caused the lockup. 
i am mailing this after booting from a _fresh_ kernel, no modules and 
your patch applied.
it works great:). hope this helps.
i can now start stress-testing it....
	Vikram
