btw. what about this error?
fs/binfmt_flat.c:760:50: error: macro "flat_get_addr_from_rp" requires 4 
arguments, but only 3 given
fs/binfmt_flat.c:760: error: ‘flat_get_addr_from_rp’ undeclared (first use in 
this function)
fs/binfmt_flat.c:760: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
fs/binfmt_flat.c:760: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [fs/binfmt_flat.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [fs] Error 2
make: *** [_all] Error 2
any chance to get that fixed prior to .23? (not a regression, but
happens approx. since blackfin was merged)
Thanks,
Jan
