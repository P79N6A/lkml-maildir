Erm, I guess I see what you mean, but it comes to the effect of tying
your hands now in a specific way, rather than having them tied in an
unknown way later on...
But I hadn't noticed the 32-bit boot protocol spec go in.  Unfortunately
it isn't useful for booting a pv Xen guest; I just mailed my comments. 
I hope we can iterate this to something more generally useful before
getting too wedded to the current protocol.
