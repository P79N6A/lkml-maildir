No. uname is generally not a reliable source to tell you the bitness (or 
more precisely, the arch). It may even happen that you cannot find out 
at all if access permissions are set 'correctly'.
You may find ELF64 files flying around in the filesystem, and while that 
is a strong indication of a 64-bit kernel being running, it is not a 
definite Yes.
