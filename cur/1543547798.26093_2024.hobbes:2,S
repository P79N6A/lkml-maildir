1. This function is only used in the poorly maintained ftape driver.
   The usage there isn't appriopriate for modern kernels.
2. This function acts only on the sig set of the current process, so
   the first parameter should be just  a porinter to current, instead of
   currgen->sigset.
So it should be presumably removed all-together.
