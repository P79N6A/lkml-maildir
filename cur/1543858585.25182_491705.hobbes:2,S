It'll get in when the developers feel it is at a stage where it can be
supported, at the moment (I'm not speaking for all the nouveau team
only my own opinion) the API isn't stable and putting it into the
kernel only means we've declared the API supportable, I know in theory
marking it EXPERIMENTAL might work, in practice it will just cause us
headaches at this stage, there isn't enough knowledgeable developers
working on it both support users and continue development at a decent
rate, so mainly ppl are concentrating on development until it can at
least play Q3, and for me dualhead on my G5 :-)
