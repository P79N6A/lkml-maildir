Can the people who are seeing this kernel message in 2.2.x, and see it
on some kind of regular basis, please get in touch with Alexey and
myself?
I've never been able to trigger it myself, so the only way we can debug
and fix this is with the direct help of those who can reproduce it.
Thanks a lot.
Later,
