These are very good points.  And the solution exists - if you want these
options then simply run the program at a lower priority than the
kernel threads.  Doing this is not a problem. 
You _can_ run a process at highest priority, but you don't have to!

Linux is safe, and you bring up a non-issue.  So what if the app couldn't
get higher priority than kernel threads?  You could then implement
it as a kernel thread and get the same problem anyway. No difference.

Yes, or they can simply run the app at a slightly lower priority until
it is fully tested so they know it can be trusted.  
People sometimes need to not be delayed by kernel threads, and that
is not a problem as long as the application gives up the cpu after
it finishes doing the time-critical work.  We want linux to be
able to do these kinds of work too.
saying that the os doesn't have control does not make sense.  The
os will give away a cpu - but only if _you_ let it.
