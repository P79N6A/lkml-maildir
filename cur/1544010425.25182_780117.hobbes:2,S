| Subject: [PATCH 1/2] pid: Implement ns_of_pid
| 
| A current problem with the pid namespace is that it is
| easy to do pid related work after exit_task_namespaces which
| drops the nsproxy pointer.
| 
| However if we are doing pid namespace related work we are
| always operating on some struct pid which retains the pid_namespace
| pointer of the pid namespace it was allocated in.
| 
| So provide ns_of_pid which allows us to find the pid
| namespace a pid was allocated in.
| 
| Using this we have the needed infrastructure to do pid
| namespace related work at anytime we have a struct pid,
| removing the chance of accidentally having a NULL
| pointer dereference when accessing current->nsproxy.
