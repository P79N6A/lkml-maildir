Assuming it works because it would be a bug if it didn't is a logical 
fallacy.  Either the new entropy pool is guaranteed to be improved by 
injecting data or it isn't.  If it is, then only root should be allowed 
to inject data.  If it isn't, then the entropy estimate should increase 
when the pool is stirred.
