True, but it also implies that we need 32+ bit node number spaces to
support them, and we don't have that yet...

I would love to have >32 modems as well, but that would essentially
require a separate major for USB modems to the one used for everything
else.

A SERIAL mouse may be different from a modem, but both are serial
devices. However, see my comments later regarding this...

In that case, neither does /dev/lp[012] need device numbers allocated
to it, and we can get rid of the ones they're occupying.

See comments below...

Regarding the allocations for USB mouse and USB keyboard, the first
thing I would ask is whether there is any real use for more than one
of either. If not, this could be dealt with by simply allocating one
number for each.
However, probably a more realistic idea would be to allocate a range
of major numbers for USB buses, along the lines of the following:
	160	Primary USB bus
	161	Secondary USB bus
	162	Tertiary USB bus
	163	Quaternary USB bus
	 :
	175	16th USB bus
	 :
	191	32nd USB bus
Then within each bus, allocate the minors to map to the relevant USB
ID's (presumably the reason for the limit of 255 devices per USB bus),
and implement some means of mapping the two together...
Best wishes from Riley.
