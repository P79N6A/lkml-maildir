That makes sense.

That's good.  I can test it on a large machine (hopefully next week).

Sounds good, though we may want to do a couple of more things, we shouldn't 
kill root tasks quite as easily and we should avoid zombies since they may be 
large apps in the process of exiting, and killing them would be bad (iirc 
it'll cause a panic).
