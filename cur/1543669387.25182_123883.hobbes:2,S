I've posted an update to my patchset:
http://kernel.kolivas.org
O(1) scheduler
Interactivity backport
Preempt
Low Latency
AA VM
Read Latency2
Supermount
XFS 1.2
ACPI
CD/DVD Packet Writing
Variable HZ
Scheduler Tunables
Desktop Tuning
+/- Rmap15e
Significant updates:
The interactivity changes to the O(1) scheduler by Mingo have been 
incorporated.
Supermount has had a minor touch up to remove annoying warnings on shutdown.
XFS has been updated to the latest snapshot.
Hz may be set at config time again
Scheduler tunables has been backported from 2.5
Rmap has been updated to 15e
It became clear that even with the interactivity changes audio skipping could 
occur so I've added some more desktop tuning to this version far less drastic 
than the previous kernels. The desktop tuning patch just changes a few of the 
default settings and these are all able to be modified at config or after 
boot if so desired. The options chosen were:
Hz set to 500
Min timeslice set to 2ms
Max Timeslice set to 40ms
A FAQ on NOT renicing X with this kernel has been added to my homepage.
Please feel free to send me comments, queries, suggestions, bug reports, 
patches etc.
Enjoy!
Con
