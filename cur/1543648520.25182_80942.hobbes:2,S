The simplest interface can be read(2) and write(2) to replace ioctl(2), 
but still using a single control node [or whatever granularity currently 
exists]  I think you are over-complicating a simple issue.

Please go back and read what Linus and Al Viro have repeatedly posted 
about ioctl(2)...
Overall, one should consider here
* device mapper has never been in the Linux kernel before, thus we have 
a duty to make sure it is clean before it gets into the kernel
* ioctls appear "simple" only at first glance.  they require more 
maintenance in the long run due to the ioctl32 thunking layers, and are 
often riddled with shortsighted 32-bit size limits that reduce their 
utility on 64-bit platforms
* ioctls cannot be exported over NFS and similar interfaces
* ioctls are a way to add "do something totally different" functionality 
to a file descriptor.  IOW you read(2) and write(2) a file, and when you 
have other tasks to do to this file, add an "escape hatch"?  No, that's 
the wrong way to go.
ioctls are analogous to procfs:  they are simple, easy, and usually the 
wrong thing to do.
