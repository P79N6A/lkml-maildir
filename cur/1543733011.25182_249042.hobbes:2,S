You didn't stick with that long Christoph.  We're not even past first base 
yet.  Let's try again?
So, I've got this file "patch-2.6.8.1.bz2".  Lets suppose my older brother 
comes in & compiles it up for me & I'm now running 2.6.8.1 - it's implausible 
I know, but let's make it easier for you.  Now, why isn't my i915 working?
