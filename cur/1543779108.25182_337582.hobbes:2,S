I can't seem to get any of these patches to apply:
Applying 'remove linux/version.h from drivers/scsi/cpqfcTSinit.c'
patching file drivers/scsi/cpqfcTSinit.c
patch: **** malformed patch at line 4: #include <linux/config.h>
I've no idea what patch's problem is ... as far as I can tell there are
no line breaks or illegal characters in the email.
