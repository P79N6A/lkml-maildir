Subject: [PATCH] Add needed __devexit_p's to two gameport drivers

Hello Vojtech,
Two gameport drivers need __devexit_p wrapped around their remove functions.  A
newer binutils caught this is a link error.  This patch fixes that.
The patch is against linux-2.5 BK as of 0700 UTC 10/20/2003 and for about two
months prior to that.  The modified drivers compile cleanly for (to the best of
my recollection) alpha, sparc, sparc64, and i386.  I am not aware of any
hardware I have access to that I could test the patch on, but I think the change
is fairly straightforward.  Please consider.
Thanks,
Noah

# Wrapped a __devexit_p around the 'remove' functions of two gameport
# drivers.  The lack of __devexit_p was wrong according to linux/init.h,
# differed from the practices in nearby files, and caused a link error
# with binutils 2.14.90.0.5.
