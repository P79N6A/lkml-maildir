My question is whats the point in asking for L1_CACHE_BYTES alignment
for hardware reasons when you can't see it beyond the cache controller
anyway? Sure it makes sense for data structures only used by the CPU,
but for structures that are shared between CPUs or goes to DMA
controllers it seems to make little sense.
