errno 8 is ENOEXEC, Exec format error.
I don't know what executable file format binfmt-464c denotes, what
does "file /sbin/modprobe" say on the troubled machine?
To avoid infinite regress, it is imperative that the exec format used by
/sbin/modprobe be built _into_ the kernel, i.e. not itself be a module.
