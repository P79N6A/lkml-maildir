It'd be nice if this cache high/low watermark was adjustable, preferably 
through say the sysctl interface, on a running kernel. This would mean that 
a competent system administrator could tune the system to their needs. A 
decent runscript for a particular program (I'm assuming run as root here) 
could adjust the value to absorb the dynamics of a particular program.
