Hi,
we're developing broadband NIC driver and I have the following
question: the hardware performs PCI bus-master DMA writes into 
the RAM and the driver is either throgh polling or interrupt
handling routine reads the DMA area.
Should CPU cache affect reading data from the DMA area, i.e.
may some buffering effect or data inconherence appear? If so, 
what are the options?
I've seen some mention to allocation of non-cacheable memory
in NDIS documentation, is it something I have to do in Linux
as well?
i'd appreciate responses via email, i don't regularly monitor
the list. and of course i'll summarize to the list..
rgds,
						--alan.
