You're right - this patch won't build if CONFIG_NUMA is on, and
CONFIG_CPUSETS off.
The line added in the patch:
  +	nodes_and(nodes, nodes, current->mems_allowed);
needs to be macro'ized, using another cpuset.h routine, to a no-op, in
the case that CONFIG_CPUSET is disabled.
I'll leave the honors to Christoph (added to CC), since this is his patch.
