Of course not. It doesn't oops my Dell Latitude: on that laptop it
prevents oopses since otherwise user-space processes will oops the kernel
as soon as they make a system call or return from a system call. But this
only happens if both the CPU and glibc are capable of using SYSENTER.

Ok so it wasn't preempt.
Can you identify in which statement the oops occurs?
And can you confirm that commenting out the calls in apm.c to
save_processor_state() and restore_processor_state() eliminates the oops?
