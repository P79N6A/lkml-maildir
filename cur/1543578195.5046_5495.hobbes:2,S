Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Version 6.08BETA of the Adaptec sponsored and supported AIC7XXX
dirver is now available.  Patches against 2.4.0 and 2.2.18 are
provided here:
http://people.FreeBSD.org/~gibbs/linux/
If you are using hardware supported by the aic7xxx driver,
I would appreciate feedback on the new driver.
Changelog:
	o Honor selection timeout settings set by the user.
	o Correct a bug that could cause us to fail a command
	  that underflowed due to a check condition.  We now
	  return DID_OK in this case with the sense information
	  returned.
	o Added initial /proc support.
	o Generate module in SCSI directory so it can be
	  named just like its predecessor.
	o Complete big endian support (untested).
	o Split out our host template definition so we don't
	  muck up the namespace when our template is included
	  in hosts.c
