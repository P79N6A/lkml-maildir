Personally, I'm not sure that this idea sounds very effective. I
_like_ the fact that after pages get swapped out, my RAM gets filled
up with file pages with use. It means that although bringing a window
that I haven't used in a while takes some time to load, my apache
server, or my xterm, can serve files or requests like 'ls' much
faster. If swap was automatically pulled in to replace my file pages,
I suspect I would be trading one evil for another.
