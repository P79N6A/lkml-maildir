Ok, but it's one of the most widespread embedded x86 boards in Europe.

This was just from the last test: the result was %ch=0 and %cl=1.

%dx? Do you mean %cx or do I not understand the code? ;)

Still reboots.

No, it still works.

I assume you mean in my old_wait code, at the lines where I give out the
stuff to the LED ports? Neither %dl nor %dh has something different from
0 here. How could something come into %dx here?

I'll do that, but this won't help for the hundrets of boards which are
still out there and worked fine with the previous code...

Hope I understand you correctly - I'm not an assembler wizzard yet ;) Is
this correct:
----------8<----------
a20_test:
        pushw   %cx
        pushw   %ax
        xorw    %cx, %cx
        movw    %cx, %fs                  # Low memory (segment 0x0000)
        decw    %cx
        movw    %cx, %gs                  # High memory area (segment 0xffff)
        movw    $A20_TEST_LOOPS, %cx
        movw    %fs:(A20_TEST_ADDR), %ax  # put content of test address...
        pushw   %ax                       # ... on stack
a20_test_wait:
        incw    %ax
        movw    %ax, %fs:(A20_TEST_ADDR)
        pushw   %dx
        smsw    %dx
        call    delay                     # Serialize and make delay constant
        lmsw    %dx
        popw    %dx
        cmpw    %gs:(A20_TEST_ADDR+0x10), %ax
        loope   a20_test_wait
        popw    %fs:(A20_TEST_ADDR)
        popw    %ax
        popw    %cx
        ret
---------->8----------
Still reboots with this code.
