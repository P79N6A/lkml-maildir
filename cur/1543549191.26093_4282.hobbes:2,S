Someone did a file-change notification patch for Linux. I'm not sure exactly
what became of it, but it'd be nice to be able to build on top of it.

Implementation of Win32 wide-character functions and NT Native API calls would
require such things. And if I can share them with other bits of the kernel
(there's more than just NTFS - smbfs, msdosfs, iso9660), then I can possibly
get away with implementing less myself, and bloating the kernel less.

Not quite, though it could be used for that... It allows a client to give a
server access to parts of its address space, so that the server can provide
certain services. The main use I'm thinking of is having the kernelspace stubs
of the registry functions transparently invoke RPC requests in a userspace
registry server.

kCGI? What's that?
I suppose GDI calls _could_ be done as RPC requests, similar to how I'm
intending to do registry calls, but that would incur major overheads as MS
found between NT3.51 and NT4, hence why they moved the GDI implementation from
CSRSS.EXE into the kernel.
However, I was thinking more along the lines of GDI being implemented in
userspace by the client process, eg: wine.
