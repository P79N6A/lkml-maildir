This sounds like a good idea. How about we still allow .addr atleast for
users who know what they are doing and would want to just specify a text
addr?

The symbol_name lookup can then be done when only when .addr is non-NULL.
That said, I have a working patch I was planning to post today that
introduces the KPROBE_ADDR macro that abstracts out the architecture-specific
artefacts of getting the actual text address to probe, so kprobe modules
can be made more portable. I was envisaging this to be used by the module
writer, but with your idea, this could live in-kernel itself.
I'll cook up a patch for this in a short while.
