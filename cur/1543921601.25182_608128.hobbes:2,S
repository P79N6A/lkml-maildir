Correct, but irrelevant. The firmware indeed gets unpacked to rootfs 
before all driver initcalls, but stays as a dead weight during them, 
because udev (started by /init, which happens in init_post() called by 
kernel_init() after all initcalls) is needed to load this firmware.
Yes, there is a call to usermodehelper_init() before the initcalls in 
do_basic_setup(), this does mean that firmware can be loaded by means of 
the old and obsolete /sbin/hotplug mechanism, but who has /sbin/hotplug now?
