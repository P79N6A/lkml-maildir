For qmail and Postfix I can be. sync(8) isn't remotely useful, because
it's allowed to return before completion.

It "should", but current implementations on Linux do exactly that: flush
everything. Maybe you've got better luck with BSD softupdates, but
that's going to munch disk I/O big time next time you reboot after a
crash: fsck needed. It runs niced in the background so the machine boots
up, but the box won't satisfy higher I/O demands. Looks like a "ex
duobus malis" game.

I'd like to see your plans that prevent DoS by local users...
One machine's light load is another one's DoS attack.

Does the kernel track "whose dirty buffer is this" (uid_t) at all?
