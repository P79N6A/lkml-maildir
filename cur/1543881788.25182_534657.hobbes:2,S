That would also be useful.
But really identifying offending patch using bisection would help most. 
And it should be pretty easy and not too much time consuming for you, as 
the bug triggers immediately upon boot in your case.
In case you are not convenient with "bisecting by hand" Andrew's quilt 
patchset, don't forget that it is also possible to obtain -mm tree through 
git, which provides very convenient means for bisecting. This is what I 
usually do.
