Subject: [PATCH 3/10] try parent numa_node at first before using default v2

this one already in -mm, but it needs [PATCH 1/10]
[PATCH 3/10] try parent numa_node at first before using default v2
For pci_device, pcibios_scan_root and pci_scan_root will call pci_device_add.
pci_device_add will call device_initialize and set_dev_node(&dev->dev,
pcibus_to_node(bus)).
other device such as netdev, and usb_device, set_dev_node is never be
used. So that field numa_node always is -1.
So for netdev, it will need to use dev->parent to get pci_device to
use it's numa_node. esp in netdev_alloc_skb()
not sure how other device such as infiniband do that.
Actually before patch
[PATCH 1/2] x86_64: get mp_bus_to_node as early
there is a bug about squence of bus->sysdata and using pcibus_to_node.
the numa_node of pci_dev->dev is never set correctly...always 0.
So some device have to use pcibus_to_node(to_pci_dev(dev)->bus) directly
such as dma_alloc_pages in arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-dma.c.
or hwif_to_node in include/linux/ide.h
According to Stefan Richter
  - Change all subsystems to set dev->parent before device_initialize().
    *Document* that the device_initialize() API has this requirement.
    This is counter-intuitive, amounts to some work across the kernel,
    and could be gotten wrong again in future code because it's a
    counter-intuitive API.
  - Move your code from device_initialize() to device_add().  One minor
    drawback is that node-specific allocations based on the device's
    numa_node would not be optimized before device_add(), but there is
    probably no need for this.  Driver probes come after device_add().
  - Let subsystems explicitly call set_dev_node() on their own.
this patch is using second method.
Also we don't need call set_dev_node in pci_device_add anymore. but need to
make sure every pci root bus's bridge device numa is set.
with this patch, we could use device->numa_node direclty for all device.
