This is true in this particular case, and your added "static" is good.
But you seem to miss the root of the problem, that isdn_common.c declares
an "isdn_divert_if *divert_if", and divert/divert_init.c declares
an "isdn_divert_if divert_if" (initialized non-zero).  When the two .os
were linked, you got a single "divert_if" (initialized non-zero in .data).
Wouldn't it be best to (keep the "static" but also) change the name of the
pointer in isdn_common.c?
