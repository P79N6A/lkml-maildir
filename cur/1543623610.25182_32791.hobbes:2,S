How can a drive can accept a command while it is disconnected from the bus.
Did you mean that after it reconnects it might refuse the ordered tag and
accept another?  That would be a bug, I'd think.

It would mean we would have to wait for completion of the tagged command
before submitting any more commands.  Not nice, but not horribly costly
either.
