Yes I overlooked. Excuse me.

It will unblock after 10 sec if not wakenup before by the reception of
some new packet.
So after 10 sec the loop restart and you'll be inside cleanup_rbuf again
and you'll send a new ack. Dave said it's not needed though so probably I
missed something here too.

This was in the case that rcvbuf got shrunk if I remember well. But I
can't continue to play with linux now so I'll have a look at these issues
again this night.
