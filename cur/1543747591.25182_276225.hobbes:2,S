right. Or instead of aborting jackd might print a debug output (like
"client foo violated RT constraints"). 
But the calls to gettimeofday would need to be done right before and
after every process callback as each client's RT thread does wait on the
FIFO to get woken by jackd. This waiting would appear as RT constraints
violation if the gettimeofday would be done only once per thread
lifetime at thread startup.

BTW: i suppose pretty much every jack client except for very simple ones
do break the RT constraints.
