Well, I know this has been discussed back and forth.
__u16 is a kernel type and is defined if you #include <linux/input.h>.
uint16_t isn't.
__u* is used extensively in the input API anyway, so you'd have to
explain it to userspace programmers nevertheless. So I prefer keeping
the input.h include use just one type of explicit sized types.
Sure, we can change them all to uint*_t, but then do it all at once and
provide a satisfactory explanation for it. ;)
