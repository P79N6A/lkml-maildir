platform_device_add() initialises a bunch of things in pdev->dev and _then_
calls device_register(&pdev->dev) which calls device_initialize() to "init
device structure".  This happens after we've already done some
initialisation on the thing.   This is not nice.
A better design would be to rip out all the device_initialize() calls and
require that the caller run device_initialize() before "add"ing or
"register"ing the platform_device.
And indeed platform_device_alloc() already does that.  If that is
sufficient then we're in good shape.
If it is not sufficient then more thought would be needed.  We could at
least run device_initialize() at the _start_ of platform_device_add(),
rather than towards the end.
icky stuff.
