Hmmm. either you need more coffee, or I need a new compiler.
I'm using 2.95.2, and there seems to be some question marks over that.
Unfortunately debian/potato doesn't seem to offer anything else
(Except 2.7.2), so I'll try to download and compile egcs-1.1.2 and see
how that works.
I ran my test script, which builds a variety of raid5 arrays with
varying numbers of drives and chunk sizes, and runs mkfs/bonnie/dbench
on each array, and it got through about 8 file systems but choked on
the 9th by trying to allocate lots of blocks in the system zone (after
running for about an hour).
