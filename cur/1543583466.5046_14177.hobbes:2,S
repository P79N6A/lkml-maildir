Well Intel has been a continual contributor to Linux and BSD. Somebody
is not getting to the right person. There are lazy people at all
companies. 
Here is a compressed `grep` of linux-kernel mail headers from Intel
who had something useful to say during the past year. Maybe you
can ask one of them for the information you need? You just need to
find an advocate at a big company.
Cheers,
