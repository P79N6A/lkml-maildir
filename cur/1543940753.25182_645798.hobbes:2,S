Yes, I think so.

The mmu_rmap_notifiers are already one separate pair of callouts and
we can add more of them of course.

Good, this "block" is how you close the race condition, and you need
the second callout to "unblock" (this is why it could hardly work well
before with a single invalidate_range).

This sounds good.

Yes.
KVM can deal with both invalidate_page (atomic) and invalidate_range (sleepy)
GRU can only deal with invalidate_page (atomic)
XPMEM requires with invalidate_range (sleepy) +
before_invalidate_range (sleepy). invalidate_all should also be called
before_release (both sleepy).
It sounds we need full overlap of information provided by
invalidate_page and invalidate_range to fit all three models (the
opposite of the zero objective that current V3 is taking). And the
swap will be handled only by invalidate_page either through linux rmap
or external rmap (with the latter that can sleep so it's ok for you,
the former not). GRU can safely use the either the linux rmap notifier
or the external rmap notifier equally well, because when try_to_unmap
is called the page is locked and obviously pinned by the VM itself.
