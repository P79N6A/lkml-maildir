Well, to address #2 and #3 isolated map will need to be exported as well.
Those other maps do not really have much to do with the scheduler code.
That's why I think either kernel/cpumask.c or kernel/cpu.c is a better place for them.

Please note that we're not talking about completely disabling IRQs. We're talking about
not routing them to the isolated CPUs by default. It's still possible to explicitly reroute an IRQ
to the isolated CPU.
Why is this needed  ? It is actually very easy to explain. IRQs are the major source of latency 
and overhead. IRQ handlers themselves are mostly ok but they typically schedule soft irqs, work 
queues and timers on the same CPU where an IRQ is handled. In other words if an isolated CPU is 
receiving IRQs it's not really isolated, because it's running a whole bunch of different kernel 
code (ie we're talking latencies, cache usage, etc). 
If course some folks may want to explicitly route certain  IRQs to the isolated CPUs. For example 
if an app depends on the network stack it may make sense to route an IRQ from the NIC to the same 
CPU the app is running on.
