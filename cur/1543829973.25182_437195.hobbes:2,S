I'm always suspicious of "cleanups" which add more code than they remove ;)

Above everything else, this probably needs to be in its very own patch,
where it is trivially verifiable.

In general, I think there is some good stuff in here.  However, instead
of concentrating on "kernel coding style conventions" and numeric (80
column) guidelines, I really hope that people consider _readability_
when modifying this code.  I don't think this patch makes the code much
more readable.
That said, there are some nice helper function in here.  Would you be
able to break this patch up into maybe 10 or 15 smaller patches?  I have
the feeling it will be easier to find the good bits then.

I think I kinda like when these are present in headers.  I usually
stumble across the header declarations before I do the ones in the .c
files, and it is always nice to see the header visually _matching_
the .c file, and how the variable is intended to be used
