No, the requirements of filesystems are very specialised: in
particular you know you are only going to be dealing with small sets
of updates, and you have very relaxed locking requirements.
General-purpose application-level journaling is MUCH more complex ---
get a database, that's what they are there for.
Note that libdb2 in glibc supports transactions, btw.
