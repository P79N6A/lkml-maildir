OK, this was my fault :-)
In 2.5.X, psmouse_initialize is actually setting the resolution, etc,
whereas 2.4.X is just using the mouse's power on default.  Adding:
Option "Resolution" "200"
to my X config file, seems to initialise the mouse in a similar way,
and it works fine.
Never noticed this with any other PS/2 mouse, though.  Maybe this one
just has an unusual power-on default setting?
John.
