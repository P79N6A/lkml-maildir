Greetings,
I recently got cranky at my old, slow Cyrix 6x86 and blew a bunch of money
on a nice fast PII.
However, Linux refuses to detect more than 64M of RAM on my new motherboard
without being told how much there is.  A quick survey of friends revealed
that the whizbang new memory-detection code in recent kernels works just
fine for them, yet not for me.
If I've overlooked any crucial details, please email me and I'll quite
happily send them to you.
(Incidentally, does anyone know why the warning buzzer on the motherboard
goes off during memory-intensive activities (like the BIOS memory test),
and why my machine runs fine for maybe ten minutes, then locks up when
jumpered to use a 100 MHz bus?  I've already replaced the RAM, but that
hasn't helped.  I'd appreciate any suggestions y'all might have. =)
