NOT AN OPTION... first RH 6.0 does not come with a gcc 2.7.2
compiler (at least I did not see one) ..second I am not going to
try again to build either a cross compiler or a gcc compiler and
potentially screw up my system.. third I SIMPLY SHOULD NOT HAVE
TO HAVE 2 C COMPILERS. fourth that means that while I am
compiling my kernel I cannot compile anything else..
having 2 compilers is just a 'work around' for quirks between
compilers, unless it is a cross compiler
