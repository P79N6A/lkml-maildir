Are you talking about some sort of I/O cabinet/chassis that you
can attach to the actual computer? Can the I/O expander unit be
hotplugged? Or do you need to power your machine down to attach
it?
If you can hotplug it, I'm guessing that is why your firmware
presents SxFy objects in the namespace with "weird" _SUN values,
and it's why you have to check _STA to see if the slots are valid
or not. That means the value returned by _SUN will change too,
right? What will it turn into?
Is that right? Or am I completely wrong? :)

You are right -- I got confused about the interpreter returning
AE_NOT_FOUND vs the actual firmware returning an error value.
Thank you for this clarification.

This is true, but HP platforms provide _INI at the root
device/host bridge level, not on SxFy objects, so it doesn't seem
that we would need to call _STA before calling _SUN for SxFy.
Does your firmware provide _INI on SxFy objects?

Yes, that sounds right...

Our firmware teams seem to think that _STA should give the status
of the card for hotplug support and general functional state.
They claim that it doesn't makes much sense to support _STA on
the slot itself unless you can physically change the slot
topology on the machine at runtime, which we can't do (although
maybe you can).
The section of the spec you quoted is correct as long as we are
talking ACPI 2.0 or later. My platforms implement ACPI 1.0b for
legacy reasons. :-/
In ACPI 1.0b, _EJx definition says (section 6.3.2):
	For hot removal, the device must be immediately ejected
	when the OS calls the _EJ0 control method. The _EJ0
	control method does not return until ejection is
	complete. After calling _EJ0, the OS will call _STA to
	determine whether or not the eject succeeded.
So your firmware implementation does not seem backward compatible
with the 1.0b spec. The different versions of ACPI is part of the
reason why my patch is breaking on your machine.
But as long as we are quoting the spec...  :)
	_SUN evaluates to a DWORD that is the number to be used
	in the user interface. This number is required to be
	unique among the slots of the same type. It is also
	recommended that this number match the slot number
	printed on the physical slot whenever possible.
	section 6.1.6 of ACPI 2.0c
My question is, why is your firmware returning multiple values of
1023 then? This seems to be the real reason why my patch is
breaking on your machine.
While depending on ACPI 1.0b behavior might be somewhat risky,
returning the same value for _SUN multiple times, for slots of
the same type, definitely seems non-compliant.
What is your opinion?

Thanks for this explanation about treating non-present _STA as
present. It makes sense.

I somewhat disagree that firmware doesn't normally provide _STA
for PCI hotplug slots, but I think that is a side-issue. :)
Thanks.
