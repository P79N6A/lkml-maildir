Yes! This is good.

It would be trivial to emulate the traditional unix API on top
of this, right? Of course we already have unixy system calls.

The "everything in userspace" fanatics are just as bad as the
newbies that think everything belongs in the kernel. It is hard
to convince both groups, since every feature can be implemented
