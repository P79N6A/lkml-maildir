To be honest, I prefer put again this :
 +#ifdef CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC
 +      if (nr_ioapics && !skip_ioapic_setup)
 +              return;
 +#endif
 +#ifdef CONFIG_ACPI
 +      if (acpi_irq_model != ACPI_IRQ_MODEL_PIC)
 +              return;
 +#endif
about Linus suggestion : 
-	new_irq = dev->irq & 0xf;
+	new_irq = dev->irq;
+	if (!new_irq || new_irq >= 15)
+		return;
no, we have problem with VIA SATA controllers which have irq lower than
15
