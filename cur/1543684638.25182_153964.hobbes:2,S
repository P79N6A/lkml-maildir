It doesn't work reliably because the threading implementation might
have to send signals which the current combination of credentials does
not allow.
IMHO, POSIX is wrong to favor process attributes so strongly.  It
wouldn't be a problem if there were other ways to pass these implicit
parameters (such as thread-specific attributes, or, even better,
syscall arguments).  But often there isn't.
