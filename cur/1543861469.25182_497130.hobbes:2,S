If a thread simply blocks, that will not permit a cpu plug/unplug to proceed.
The thread had to explicitly call try_to_freeze().  CPU plug/unplug will
not occur (and cpu_online_map will not change) until every process in the
machine has called try_to_freeze()).
So the problem which you're referring to will only occur if a workqueue
callback function calls try_to_freeze(), which would be mad.
Plus flush_workqueue() is on the way out.  We're slowly edging towards a
working cancel_work() which will only block if the work which you're trying
to cancel is presently running.  With that, pretty much all the
flush_workqueue() calls go away, and all these accidental rarely-occurring
deadlocks go away too.
