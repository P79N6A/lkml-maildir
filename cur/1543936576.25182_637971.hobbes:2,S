or _wdt/wdt_ like the rest of the watchdog code uses for watchdog names
(wdt ->watchdog timer).

No.

Yes. That's a common confusion. -ENOIOCTLCMD is a magic code used
internally by some mid layers to indicate the driver doesn't know the
ioctl so use default behaviour. -ENOTTY (confusingly but this is Unix
history) is the right answer for unknowns.

Saves memory - you can't make inlined strings __initdata without breaking
some compilers. So it is correct.

IFF the device can be found/removed dynamically.

The core watchdog code only supports one watchdog currently. This again
is correct.
