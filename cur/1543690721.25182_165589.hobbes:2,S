is there sync between 2.4, 2.6, and pciids.sf.net ?  ;-)
Linus and Marcelo should not accept patches against pci.ids,
all updates should go to pciids.sf.net. And every X time
to do a sync with 2.4 and 2.6.
It's the easiest, because otherwise is a chaos and it
takes too much work to do several merges:
2.4 <-> 2.6
2.4 <-> pciids
2.4 <-> 2.6
