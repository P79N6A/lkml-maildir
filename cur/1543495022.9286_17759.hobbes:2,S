Not sure if this is a kernel issue or not, but thought I could at least field
the q to you.
I make a regular use of smb mounts, and have noticed a problem w/ them. At
shutdown, it attempts to unmount the SMB file systems along with the local
file systems, rather than with the network file systems. This means that if I
don't remember to unmount them manually before shutdown, the shutdown process
grinds to a halt when it's unmounting file systems.
I don't know if this is a kernel issue or not, so if not, please direct me to
the most appropriate forum for this q. If it would qualify as a kernel issue,
it would be appreciated if it would be forwarded to the kernel crew to be
fixed.
Thank you very much for your time.
PS, thanks for the help w/ my previous q, about the kernel image that was too
big. I aparrently needed to use bzlilo. Thanks very much.
