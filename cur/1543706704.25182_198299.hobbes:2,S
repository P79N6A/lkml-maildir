There will be decoders which convert ASCII "a" to "A" too.  We can't
fix broken code; at least we can make it clear to anyone writing a
decoder what is acceptable, and that being "liberal" in what's decoded
is not acceptable and considered a security flaw.
An app author only writes the UTF-8 decoder once; it isn't at all hard
to convert non-minimal forms to the replacement char U+FFFD.
(Although that could be a security hole in some cases, it's much
better than allowing non-zero characters to decoder to NUL or "/" or
".").  Rejecting a non-minimal form is often hard, because the UTF-8
decoder is often used in a place which cannot flag errors.

The one which "ls" and other programs show as "A".
The other one will typically show as "?" or a diamond or something.

Indeed some software will do it, and worse than that: they may look
the same in an editor or file selector.  (See recent problems with
misleading URLs for why that sort of thing can be a security hole).
The combining char problem is similar to case folding: some
filesystems and programs treat "a" and "A" as equivalent too.  If the
kernel had an encoding converter, and the filesystem stored iso-8859-1
while userspace was presented with utf-8, it is likely that several
Unicode characters would be mapped to "a", causing similar problems to
automatic case folding in filesystems.
In other words, there is no clear solution to this problem.
