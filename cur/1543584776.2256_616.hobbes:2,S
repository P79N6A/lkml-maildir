I've been following this advice for some time, but doing so tripped me up.
My system is RH 6.2, but with kernel 2.4 (and latest modutils etc). I
kept my kernel headers at 2.2.14, i.e. those supplied with the 6.2
kernel-headers RPM.
This breaks XFree 86 4, however, which checks the kernel version you are
*running* and then expects the headers for that kernel to be available. To
build X I had to move the symlink to point at some 2.4 headers so X could
find (IIRC) input.h, and others. 
So what's at fault here? X for looking at the current kernel, me for not
telling X not to do that, or me again for not recompiling glibc and using
the new headers 'legally'?
Chris.
