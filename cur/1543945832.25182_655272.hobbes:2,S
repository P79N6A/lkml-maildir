Yes, thanks.
Most probably the SD driver does something it's not supposed to do in its
.suspend() or .resume() routine.
I've created the Bugzilla entry at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10030
for this problem, please add yourself to the CC list in there.
I'll be looking at this problem in the next few days.
Thanks,
Rafael
