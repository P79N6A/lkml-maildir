if you look at the code in fs/proc/base.c::proc_exe_link() you can
see how the absolute pathname is gathered (note: only on execve is the
VM_EXECUTABLE flag set).  basically you need the dentry and vfsmount
of the file.  btw, you are only stopping tcp and bound udp if you hook
in sys_connect, perhaps you should consider the sendmsg family as well.
also, if the trojan is a server you have not protected listen/accept or
resvmsg so sys_socket may be the best spot to watch.
also, all of this can be done using the LSM framework.  (see lsm.immunix.org
for patches).
cheers,
