Can we please encode units in the filename using a separator other than "_"?
the reason for this is that _ is already_used_to_separate_words in the
entries, and it gets difficult to know if something is part of the entry
name or an unit.
Please consider using ":" to separate units and other specific qualifiers
(e.g. led colors) from the main attribute name.  This helps userspace
applications to behave better when faced with stuff like "a_b_c:unit1" and
"a_b_c:unit2" at the same time.
That said, AFAIK using units is explicitly discouraged on hwmon-style sysfs
classes.  The recent thread about a battery class illustrates this.  Please
keep this in mind.
