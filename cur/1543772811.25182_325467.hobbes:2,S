Subject: optimal file order for reading from disk

I know this will be dependent on filesystem, I/O scheduler, ...
but given a list of files, what is the best (filesystem
agnostic) order to read from disk (to minimise seeks).
Should I sort by path, inode number, getdents, or something else?
thanks,
Pádraig.
