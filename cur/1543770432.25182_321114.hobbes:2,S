Ingo just answered it and I commonly touch on this subject off and on
and including this thread recently.

I answered this already in this thread with the digression about RTAI.
I believe that it is a clear explanation but it's a bit out of the box
so to speak since it's looking towards more sophisticated uses of this
patch from an overall software design point of view.

There's really no good reason why this kernel can't get the same latency
as a nanokernel. The scheduler paths are riddled with SMP rebalancing
stuff and the like which contributes to overall system latency. Remove
those things and replace it with things like direct CPU pining and you'll
start seeing those numbers collapse. There are also TLB issues, but there
are many way of reducing and stripping down this kernel to reach so called
nanokernel times. Nanokernel times are overidealized IMO. It's not
because of design necessarily, but because of implementation issues that
add more latency to the deterministic latency time constant.
Just a thread wake operation under an 2x SMP box flattens the latency
histogram from a 8 usec spike to a 10-22 usec spread (800mhz p3 2x)
roughly. There are many more spots that contribute to latency that can
be made static or precomputed in some way.
RT priority thread rebalancing and IPI send off adds to this rescheduling
latency as well.

Again, I think I answered this in the RTAI discussion in this thread.
If you can groke my lingo then it should lay a kind of design track
where this kind of kernel design can be easier and more flexible to
work with in regards to future kernel subsystem alterations.

Shut up :)
