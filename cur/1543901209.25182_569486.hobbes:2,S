Hi Mikael,
the last maintainer update to arch/cris/ was two years ago and it seems 
code like e.g. the config variable ETRAX_ARCH_V32 is missing.
I assume there is there some external tree you use that contains updates?
If yes, can you submit the changes for inclusion into the upstream kernel?
TIA
Adrian
