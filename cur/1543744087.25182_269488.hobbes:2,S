No, I don't think the arch code should be registering the cpu devices
(or the node devices).  There is very little that is arch-specific about
these, and the same code is more or less duplicated between the
architectures.

I see your point here, though, and I'm slightly embarrassed I forgot
that ppc64 has similar needs.  What is needed is an arch-specific
__cpu_add which is called from cpu_add after the new cpu's bit has been
reserved, and which sets up the architecture's physical<->logical
associations or whatever.  This follows the convention established in
the existing cpu code and keeps the manipulation of cpu_present_map in
one place.
I'll incorporate this in my next attempt.
