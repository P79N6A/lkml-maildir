Hi there,
unfortunately, I'm everything else but a developer, so please be a bit
patient with me.
As indicated by the subject, I got annoyed by the error message
mentioned flooding my log files. Comparing ftdi_sio.c to some of the
other usb->serial converter drivers, I decided to apply the following
small patch:
________
--- linux-2.6.10.orig/drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.c	2004-12-24 21:35:24.000000000 +0000
+++ linux-2.6.10/drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.c	2005-01-29 17:10:11.000000000 +0000
@@ -1518,7 +1518,7 @@
 	dbg("%s port %d, %d bytes", __FUNCTION__, port->number, count);
 
 	if (count == 0) {
-		err("write request of 0 bytes");
+		dbg("%s - write request of 0 bytes", __FUNCTION__);
 		return 0;
 	}
 	
________
It solved my problem but I can't judge, of course, whether the use of
err() instead of dbg() is justified or even common in this place, as,
for instance, ftdi_sio.c is considered experimental. Therefore I would
be grateful to get a short response.
Thank you very much in advance,
Elias
