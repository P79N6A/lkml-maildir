	I would appreciate any pointers to any documentation on the
various kernel memory address spaces that linux-2.3.23 uses and the
macros and routines used to convert between them.
	I have been puzzling over the (identical) memory allocation
routines in drivers/usb/cpia.c and drivers/char/bttv.c, which do not
compile.  I have in mind a number of ways that might fix the problem
(including transplanting the code from drivers/char/planb.c), but
I am not sure if all of the other code in other drivers that I have
been looking at for examples is really correct, and I would like to
get the change right.  Anyhow, any pointers (no pun intented) would
be appreciated.
