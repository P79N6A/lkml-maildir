I'm forgetting an important detail here.  Kosaki-san has clearly stated
that this hook, at vmscan's writepage, is too late for his embedded needs,
and that they need the feedback a bit earlier, when the page moves from
the active list to the inactive list.
However, except for the placement of such hooks in three or four
places, rather than just one, it may well be (if cpusets could be
factored out) that one mechanism would meet all needs ... except for
that pesky HPC need for throttling to more or less zero the swapping
from select cpusets.
