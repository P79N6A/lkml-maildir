Good stuff.  I reduced it to (having trouble easily reading the original
output):
    name=$(head -1 /proc/$1/status | awk '{print $2}')
    echo -n '[' $1 '] ' $name ' '
    if [ "$(cat /proc/$1/maps)" == "" ]
    then
	    echo SAFE
    else
	    echo changeable
    fi
It catches all those that need catching, plus denies changes to some
daemons that could survive sched_setaffinity: khubd, kirqd, pdflush*,
kswapd0, scsi_eh_[01], ahc_dv_[01], kseriod, and kjournald*.
