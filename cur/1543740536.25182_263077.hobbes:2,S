Even I thought so. But, with the emulator it doesn't hang. It brings 
back my video. I double checked this using another vm86 emulator too. 
No hang even there. I couldn't figure out why Ole's patch won't work 
though. Right now I am using call_usermodehelper() to call the 
emulator during resume and the video comes back just fine on this 
system where Ole's patch didn't work.
Thanks,
