I have been off into the LVM2 muttle puddle, between kernels 2.4.22 and
2.6.0-t5. . .
If I do not include LVM2 below reiserfs then, yes, the 2.6.0 reiserfs file.c
patch you provided works (for files larger than 4GB).  Thanks!
However, if I include LVM2 on the 2.6.0-t5 kernel and place a reiserfs on
top of LVM2 logical volume, I get "Input/output errors" from diff commands
for files >2GB.
Again if I use a similar file system config. using the 2.4.22 kernel
everything works fine.  More on this latter.  ( I may  missing
omething  ->[more research].)
