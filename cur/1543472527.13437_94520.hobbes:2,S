Let's say we added the following:
CONFIG_USE_PATENTS       For non-US people only. Sure. :-)
#ifdef CONFIG_USE_PATENTS
/* --BEGIN PATENT--
 * number 435353425
 * expire 20031127
 * owner Motorola
 * name PPP
 * --END PATENT--
 */
  /* good code goes here */
#else
  /* crummy code goes here */
#endif
Also have a tool to scan for expired patents.
