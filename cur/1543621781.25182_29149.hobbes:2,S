Well, this clik-clak noise sounds like a hardware problem.  I don't know
why it would only show up under 2.4.17 and not 2.4.3.
Can you try "dd if=/dev/hdX of=/dev/null bs=4k" to see if this completes
under both kernels?  Any messages in 'dmesg' that look like IDE errors?
The one thing I also thought of was that kernels 2.4.10+ have the block
devices in page cache, and some people have problems with ulimits when
reading >2GB from the device, but that wouldn't affect block 32783...
Cheers, Andreas
