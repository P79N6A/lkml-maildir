Hi!
(Please CC me your answers as I am not subscribed.)
I have a problem with 2.6.14.3 kernel (but this probably isn't too 
version-specific). I have a kernel which succesfully boots on totally 
random basis (cca 70% is success). My root partition resides on a SATA 
disc connected to a controller on Intel 6300ESB ICH southbridge (mb 
Intel se7320vp2). There is a reiserfs 3 filesystem on my root partition. 
Without any changes to configuration (os or bios or whatever) I 
sometimes get:
VFS: Cannot open root device "801" or unknown block(8,1)
Could this be some timeout issue, or indication of crappy hw? I've tried 
this about 10 times (immediately ctrl+alt+del on successfull boot or 
reset button on aforementioned panic) and I saw no regularities in this 
misbehaviour.
I sincerely appreciate any advice anyone can give.
Thanks,
r.
