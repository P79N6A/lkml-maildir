It's independent of these questions. The decision between tasklet and
workqueue is mostly:
- If you need non-atomic operations (e.g. allocate memory with GFP_KERNEL),
  you have to use work queues.
- If you need very low latencies for processing the interrupts, you should
  use tasklets.
- When in doubt, use work queues.
