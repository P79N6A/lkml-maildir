The pattern you are seeing here is probably due to the page allocator
always retrying process context allocations which are <= order 3 (64K
with 4K pages).
You might be able to increase this limit a bit for your system, but it
could easily cause problems. Especially fragmentation on nommu systems
where the anonymous memory cannot be paged out.
