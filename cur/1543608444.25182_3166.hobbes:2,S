Not that much. Alan's point is that you're pushing the limit of the
memory bandwidth, not the number of CPUs. This is the single reason
that high traffic websites either use some serious non-PC hardware (IBM
Z-series, for example) or a large number of PCs in parallel to share
the load.

The number of CPUs really doesn't matter in this case. With several
GigE cards memory bandwidth and latency is your main problem.
