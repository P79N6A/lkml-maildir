To head off the criticism, I admit this is an oversimplification, and true 
busy-waiters should be using cpu_relax(), which contains a barrier.  As 
discussed in recent threads, there are other cases which can be optimized by 
removing the need for a barrier, and having behavior consistent with 
architectures where the benefit is more profound is also valuable.
