The design was as follows:
- Doing anything in the crashing kernel is unreliable.
- We do not have the information to do anything useful in the recovery/target
  kernel.
- Having the other cpus stopped is very nice as it reduces the amount of
  weirdness happening.  We do not share the same text or data addresses
  so stopping the other cpus is not mandatory.  On some other architectures
  there are cpu tables that must live at a fixed address but this is not
  the case on x86.
- Having the location the other cpus were running at is potentially very
  interesting debugging information.
Therefore the intent of the code is to send an NMI to each other cpu.  With
a timeout of a second or so.  So that if the NMI do not get sent we continue
on.
There is certainly still room for improving the robustness by not shutting
down the ioapics and using less general infrastructure code on that path.
That said I would be a little surprised if that is what is biting us.
Looking at the patch the local_irq_enable() is totally bogus.  As soon
was we hit machine_crash_shutdown the first thing we do is disable irqs.
I'm wondering if someone was using the switch cpus on crash patch that was
floating around.  That would require the ipis to work.
I don't know if nmi_exit makes sense.  There are enough layers of abstraction
in that piece of code I can't quickly spot the part that is banging the hardware.
The location of nmi_exit in the patch is clearly wrong.  crash_kexec is a noop
if we don't have a crash kernel loaded (and if we are not the first cpu into it),
so if we don't execute the crash code something weird may happen.  Further the
code is just more maintainable if that kind of code lives in machine_crash_shutdown.
