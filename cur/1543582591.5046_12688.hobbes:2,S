the way i'm reading this, the problem is there's 65535 files in the directory
/where/postfix/lives.  rm * or what have you, is going to take forever and
ever, and bog the machine down while its doing it.  My understanding is you
could do the rm *, and instead of it reading the tree over and over for every
file that has to be deleted, it just jumps one or two blocks to the file that's
being deleted, instead of thousands of files to be scanned for each file
deleted.
