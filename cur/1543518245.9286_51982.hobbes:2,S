This is what I'm been doing.  The problem I had before was that I was
compiling an application for another machine (using a different kernel
from the one installed in /usr/src/linux) and this application needed
an include file from include/linux which had changed between these two
kernel versions and thus it was important to get the correct one.
So what I needed was a file in /usr/src/linux-whatever/include/linux,
but adding "-I/usr/src/linux-whatever/include" broke the build since
the linux/include/net directory hid the one in /usr/include/linux.
I belive that what I did in the end was to create my own include
directory which had its own linux- and asm-directory with symlinks to
the /usr/src/linux-whatever tree.

Yes I agree, but sometimes a driver has to know about the specific
driver.  But no user space application should ever include anything
from the include/linux directory unless it wants to get to the
definition of a specific driver's ioctl interface.
Hmm, I wonder what I'm trying to change really.  I suppose I would
like the include/net and include/scsi directories in the linux tree to
be renamed do include/knet and include/kscsi or something like that to
avoid the name clashes with /usr/include.
