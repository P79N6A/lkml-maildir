Subject: question on memory map of process on i386
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

On i386, /proc/<pid>/maps shows the following entry:
ffffe000-fffff000 ---p 00000000 00:00 0
This page of memory is way up above TASK_SIZE (which is 0xc0000000), so 
how is it visible to userspace?
Just to complicate things,  I seem to find the vma for this page using 
find_vma_prev().
Can anyone explain what's going on?
Thanks,
Chris
