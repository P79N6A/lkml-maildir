Yes, this change was suspected to help with Mono as well, not just
Java, because both of them use their own syscall path rather than
going through glibc. The reason why you see the lock-up in a different
place is because the bug manifested in getting incorrect syscall
return codes, which probably made mono go into a normally unused
error handling case.
