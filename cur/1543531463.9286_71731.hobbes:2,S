Can you please send me an excerpt of your /var/log/message file containing 
(a) the boot-time messages showing the recognition of the drive as an 
optical 
device and the parition check for "sda" (or which ever drive letter is 
assigned)... 
(b) the error/log message entries made during your attempt to write
Also:
(1) Is the drivers/scsi/sd.c patch the only patch you applied to a clean 
version of the kernel downloaded from www.kernel.org?
(2) Can you send me a transcript of a session of your attempt to write to 
the drive...
(3) Can you send me your .config file (in /usr/src/linux) used to build 
kernel 2.2.14?
Cheers!
