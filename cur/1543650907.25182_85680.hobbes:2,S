Subject: Patch: linux-2.5.45/fs/fcblist.c - export symbols for unix sockets
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

	linux-2.5.45/fs/fcblist.c contains some symbols that are
needed for unix domain sockets if unix sockets are compiled as a
module.  fcblist.o is already in the export-objs declaration in
fs/Makefile, so I think the intention was for the EXPORT_SYMBOL
declarations to be in that file.
	Here is the patch.  I have verified that unix domain sockets
load with this patch (possibly with some more EXPORT_SYMBOL changes in
my netsyms.c, which has a bunch of additional exports).
	Davide: please let me know if this patch is OK (others are
welcome to comment too), and, if so, if you are going to forward this
to Linus or if you want me to do something more.
