Two kinds of HW failure,
   1. still readable, only write failure. 
   2. unreadable, unwriteable.
For the first case, if mount option errors=remount-ro is given or implied,
EROFS is appropriate, otherwise EIO.  For the second case, always EIO.
The current VFS design does not try to hide the problems from its
underlying fs'.
No need to make it transparent. Userland programs need to consider
both EROFS and EIO.
