The video card on that system turned out to have pci class
PCI_CLASS_NOT_DEFINED_VGA instead of PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY_VGA.
So it was disabled, and I guess that any access to it (printk())
caused machine checks without anything displayed on the screen.
A tad more care in disabling devices should fix that.
