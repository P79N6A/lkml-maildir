Have you tried playing with the laptop-mode patch? It's already in the
-mm kernel tree from Andrew Morton. I've been playing with it a little
(just a few minutes) and seems keep the disks spun down for some time.
However, I haven't been able to get it suit my needs, since I use apps
like Evolution which are continuously writting to the disk.
If you are willing to play with it, I recommend you downloading the
latest -mm patch from 
http://www.kernel.org
, untar the sources and then
read Documentation/laptop-mode.txt.
