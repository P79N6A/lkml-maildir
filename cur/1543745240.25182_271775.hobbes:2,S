Bollocks it is.
All the code I submitted I've submitted under the GPL, the real GPL not
the Linus one. All the code I submitted prior to your change and all the
code I and everyone else submitted prior to that change you have no
authorisation or right to claim ownership and relicensing rights over
beyond those originally granted. As such you have no right to restrict
them or to claim they are GPLv2 only.
