Yeah, but then: if something needs the protection that makes it
important not to be able to read trough the swap-space, it's
probably not a problem to have loads of memory. You still need
some swap, though, since (in my experience) you never can depend
on the total amount of mem needed (it really sucks, seeing a
machine going down because of a memory-leak :-( )

Nah, I'd rather have some generic user-space hook where you can
hook-in your crypting routine. Because of export-reasons.

Not really; you have, of course, all important files on crypted
filesystems. That will also mean that you need to have some "enter
password" or "insert smartcard"-mechanism before the system can
boot-up; you don't want any passwords in plain-text.

I'm not sure what you mean.
