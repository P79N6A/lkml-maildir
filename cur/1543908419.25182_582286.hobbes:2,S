In particular sysctl_check_table finds issues with the sysctl table
so register_sysctl_table refuses to register it.

As a cheap workaround it should be possible to disable SYSCTL support
in 2.6.23-rc2-mm2 to get around these issues.
Andrew for the moment I have just sent you fixes for all of the issues
that I am aware of.  Mostly they are cheap kill the sys_sysctl()
support patches.
Hopefully that is enough to bring the pain level down to manageable.
I hadn't anticipated subsystems failing because they could not register
their sysctl tables.  I was simply expecting things not to show up in
/proc/sys.  And more of the pain of making working sysctl tables to 
be pushed back to developers.
