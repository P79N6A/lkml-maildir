   on ia-64, I see the following (2.4.18, with gcc3.1):
   	- ext2_follow_link():	 16 bytes/frame
   	- vfs_follow_link():	 56 bytes/frame
   	- link_path_walk():	128 bytes/frame
   	---------------------	---------------
   	total:			200 bytes/frame
   
   Just about in line with what you'd expect given that registers are
   64 bits.
On sparc64 the situation is much worse (due to register windows)
which means any non-leaf function (function which invokes no nother
functions) equals 192 bytes of stack space per frame minimum.
