1. When the driver dumps, I want to extract all the data structures of the
BD and dump into klogd.
How can I do this. Is there any OS function calls available so that I can
hook my function (which does the data structures extraction.)
or Is there any other way.
2.  When the kernel dumps, all the register contents are displayed on the
console screen. How this is being done?
We use linux ver-2.2
Please reply.
Thanks and Regards,
jalaja
