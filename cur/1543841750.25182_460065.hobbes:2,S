This is a well known linux kernel bug.
You should start using Solaris.....
The Linux kernel bastardizes ATAPI transported SCSI commands under some
circumstances.
READ TOC & BLANK are the commands that are usually affected.
Using Solaris with exactly the same hardware verifies that it is a Linux
kernel bug.

Can we please get this fixed?
