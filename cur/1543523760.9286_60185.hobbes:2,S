NOTE: I suggested to the author that he run his benchmark on the 
same hardware under UP and SMP.  result: no significant difference.
the conclusion from the test is that his compiler produces code
that runs faster on a K6-2 than a PIII; the scheduler is irrelevant.

are you talking about ongoing silly-fest about long runqueues?
please don't confuse that with reality.
