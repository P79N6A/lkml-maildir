So are you saying that the master is flash and slave is ATA?
Did you read the ide.c about ()->ata_flash flags?
All you have to do is tell it that the flash exists.
hdx=flash will set the flag.
If this does not work then I-Opener will be required to disclose a
constant unique signature in the MTD IDENTIFY page to know to look for the
second device.
