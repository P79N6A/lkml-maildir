Similar behavior here, but I was actually showing close to 40M memory free in
'top' when /bin/bash started reporting "Can't fork" errors (no memory!). This
on a busy NFS and Intranet server that does not run X11 or any client software. 
So it appears that fragmentation is a problem too. Backing back down to 2.2.10
was the only way to solve it.
Guess that means I wait for 2.2.12 (I don't run patched kernels on our
mission-critical servers unless there's no avoiding it)...
