Subject: [PATCH] Fix triplefault on x86-64 bootup

Hello,
  after I upgraded kernel on my box to current git, only thing it did 
was rebooting in a loop.  After some digging I found that it is silly 
to apply alternative to memcpy by using that every same memcpy... 
Sorry if it is known bug, I do not see it reported in my LKML mailbox...

Do not replace whole memcpy in apply alternatives
apply_alternatives uses memcpy() to apply alternatives.  Which has
unfortunate effect that while applying memcpy alternative memcpy itself
it tries to overwrite itself with nops - which causes #UD fault as it 
overwrites half of instruction in copy loop, and from this point on only
possible outcome is triplefault and reboot.  So let's overwrite only
first two instructions of memcpy - as long as main memcpy loop is
not in first two bytes it will work fine.
