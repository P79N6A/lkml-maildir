That's am approach that I've not had the luxury of pondering till now.
I'll have to think about the potential of that for a while.
In the past I have thought that automount functionality is specialised 
enough to warrant seperation from the core VFS services. But now (after 
several months of consideration) I'm not sure that the functionality 
needed can be done without some general VFS support.
At the moment I think that if it was decided to add these services to 
the VFS then they would need to be general, not automount specific. As VFS 
services should be. But alas there are no clear requirements. For 
example, the recent proposal by Mike Waychison, although an excellent 
paper, requires a kernel expiry service but has no discussion of what is 
actually needed.
Sorry, I must be boring you with all this ranting.
