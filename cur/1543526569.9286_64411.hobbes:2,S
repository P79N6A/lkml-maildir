Maybe I commented on this to you already. It'll work. The sound drivers
do it. But it's "inconvenient". That's why I'm trying to avoid it.

Can one access an array allocated in one module from a second module?
(Linux modutils) 2.1.121    .
It still oopses.  No change except moving the "run once" data and code
into the second module.  Works fine when all in the same module.  I'll
just put up a bit of the printout and the code section involved in case
people can see the memory management problem.
Kernel was in the second module, happily traversing a home array provided by
the first module, and looking up the keys it found in an away table in the
second module.  When it found the key, it wrote the associated data value
back into another array provided from the first module.
All goes fine for the first 295 (out of 370) elements in the home array,
then bang!  The keys are 4 byte longs.  The data values are 4byte string
pointers (i.e.  char*).  It's vaguely possible that at that point the
total _data_ values returned just passed a 4K boundary.  
It actually failed looking up key #296 in the home array. That would
be at an offset of 296*4 = 1184 bytes from the start.
Weird.

Mmm ... making some minor changes in the memory allocation strategy
(making real sure that all arrays are allocated from kmalloc) doesn't change
the result, just the place at which the bang happens:
