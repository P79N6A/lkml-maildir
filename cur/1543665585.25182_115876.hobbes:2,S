I'm going to fix it by hand ;-) As long as it stops at a sensible point,
and clearly barfs and says what the problem is, that's fine by me.

Right ... I appreciate that. I'd just rather fix things up by hand 1% of
the time than use Bitkeeper myself. I'm not trying to stop *you* using
Bitkeeper by any stretch of the imagination ... you probably need the
heavyweight tools, but I'm OK without them.

Yup, that's exactly what I'm saying. I'm not saying this as good as bitkeeper,
I'm saying it's "good enough" for me and I suspect several others (not saying 
it's good enough for you), and significantly better than diff and patch.
(though cp -lR is *blindingly* fast, and diff understands hard links).
