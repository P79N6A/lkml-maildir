Subject: Rusty's mod-util and RH9.0 Question Please?

I updated my modutils with rusty's modutils
"module-init-tools-0.9.13-pre"
With the aid of paul Nasrat, he prepared me more
updated modutils and mkinitrd to make both a 2.4 and
2.5 boot correctly.
I am not sure what happend but it looks like my
"modprobe" disapeared?
Luckily before I ran the new modutils for 2.5 I copied
all my modutils as *.org.  insmod, depmod, modprobe,
rmmod, lsmod all to *.old.
Only problems is 2.5 kernels do not want that
/sbin/modprobe which I renamed from modprobe.org to 
modprobe in order to get the 2.4 kernel to insmod
correctly again.  
My question is, after updating the modutils is there a
/sbin/modprobe or is it renamed by the modutils upadte
to /sbin/modprobe.old and if that is the case why
isn't the 2.4 kernels using that?  It all of a sudden
is looking for /sbin/modprobe.
I had to cp the modprobe.org file that I saved to
modprobe and now the 2.4 kernels work fine again but
2.5 kernels do not work right with /sbin/modprobe.  SO
Now I have to manually remove /sbin/modprobe to boot
up 2.5 kernels and put modprobe back to boot up 2.4
kernels.
WHat can I do to fix this.  Is maybe asymlink borken? 
do I need to symlinke the modprobe.old which it is
already symlinked to insmode.old.
DO I have to modify my script in /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit?
If I leave the modprobe file in /etc/modprobe then the
modules for 2.5 kernels do not load correctly.
I get these messages"
GM _MODULES function not implemented 
for ieee1394 and for usb.
Just those two fail during the INIT: phase of the
kernel 2.5 bootup.
Can someone help me or explain to me what I need to
do?
SHoudl I reinstall rusty's modutils?  If so what how
do I about that?  Maybe I shoudl reinstall the
oldpackage that came with RH v9.0 then reinstall the
rusty over again?
Anyideas would be helpfull at this point.
