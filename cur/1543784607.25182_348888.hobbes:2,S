Agreed.
By the way, you or Randy mentioned something about leaving a mention of
-stable in the MAINTAINERS file.
That wouldn't have helped me this week, but if you had put the string:
	Documentation/stable_kernel_rules.txt
somewhere in the opening text of the messages that announce stable
reviews, that would have saved me some time.  I have in mind the
lkml messages such as:
	From: Chris Wright <chrisw@osdl.org>
	To: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org, stable@kernel.org
	Subject: [PATCH 0/9] -stable review
	This is the start of the stable review cycle for the 2.6.13.1 release.
Just a thought ...
