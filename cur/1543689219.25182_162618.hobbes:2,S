I got the following compile error (using gcc 2.95) in 2.6.0-test4-mm5
(but it seems to come from Linus' tree):
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC [M]  drivers/net/sungem.o
drivers/net/sungem.c:2444: duplicate initializer
drivers/net/sungem.c:2444: (near initialization for `gem_ethtool_ops.get_link')
make[2]: *** [drivers/net/sungem.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
It seems gcc is right, there are two .get_link members in this struct:
<--  snip  -->
...
static struct ethtool_ops gem_ethtool_ops = {
        .get_drvinfo            = gem_get_drvinfo,
        .get_link               = ethtool_op_get_link,
        .get_settings           = gem_get_settings,
        .set_settings           = gem_set_settings,
        .nway_reset             = gem_nway_reset,
        .get_link               = gem_get_link,
        .get_msglevel           = gem_get_msglevel,
        .set_msglevel           = gem_set_msglevel,
};
...
