Actually, there is a reason why this doesn't happen:  The drivers
directory shows only drivers belonging to a bus.  The megaraid_mm driver
is actually a PCI driver, and thus belongs to the PCI bus.  So, you'll
see this under
/sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_mm/<pci_id>/host<n>
That should be sufficient to obtain all instances.  Note: the instances
aren't numerically indexed under this scheme (unlike your adapter<n>)
they'd be indexed by a unique pci_id.
So it looks like all the information is accessible today (if you look
for it in a slightly different way).  Is there anything currently
missing?
