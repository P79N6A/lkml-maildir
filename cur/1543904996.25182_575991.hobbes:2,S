I found what causes this problem, and it only occurs during cross 
compilation.
The struct is:
#define ACPI_ID_LEN     9
struct acpi_device_id {
	 __u8 id[ACPI_ID_LEN];
	kernel_ulong_t driver_data;
};
When compiling for ia64, this results in:
struct acpi_device_id {
	__u8 id[9];
	uint64_t driver_data;
};
sizeof(struct acpi_device_id) for ia64 is due to different padding
after id[] 20 bytes on i386 but 24 bytes on ia64.
scripts/mod/file2alias.c is compiled with HOSTCC and ensures that 
kernel_ulong_t is correct (in this case uint64_t for ia64), but it can't 
cope with different padding on different architectures.
