That seems to be the problem! If the kernel is compiled without
busmouse support, and with PS/2 mouse support, then the mouse is
recognised and the keyboard does not get locked up.
This is, therefore, a warning to all:
Even if you are configuring a system with no need for a mouse (as
I had been doing until now - a system console for a server, and no
local X-server required) YOU MUST CONFIGURE THE KERNEL WITH THE
PS/2 MOUSE DRIVER (and NOT as a module) or else you are likely
to suffer the consequences!
