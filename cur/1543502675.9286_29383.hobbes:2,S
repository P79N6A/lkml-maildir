Group,
	I started a private thread and figured that I could
	take it back to the beginning and see what the
	community "thinks" of this.
	Reference : The Magic Garden Explained : page 249 - 252.
	The Internals of UNIX System V Release 4
	An Open Systems Design
	Simply, this is a System V Release 4 (SVR4) type of struct
	and would this idea be good to impliment within Linux?
	Are there other SVR4.0 items in missing in Linux that should
	be coded within Linux? The logic behind this idea is why
	re-invent the wheel, when a perfectly good one exists?
	And before I get flamed, I do need a tan :), I am not
	proposing this change, I am just curious what others think.
	Mitchell Erblich
