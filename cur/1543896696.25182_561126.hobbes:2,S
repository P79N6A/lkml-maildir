So, it's really interesting, it worked really for me (oops without patch) and
no oops with it. My hardware is a custom board with an at91rm9200.
I had a look the the kunmap_atomic function, and I _really_ don't understand
how this patch can do something :-/
And last but not least, my patch is completly wrong...
void *kmap_atomic(...);
unsigned int *buffer = kmap_atomic(...) + sg->offset; // addition in u8*
kunmap_atomic(buffer - sg->offset); // <- sub in u32*
-> please forget my patch
Regards
Marc
