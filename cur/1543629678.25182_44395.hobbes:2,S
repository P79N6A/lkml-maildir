This procedure is called from numerous places in the code.
In line 1069 of eepro100.c, comment out the call to wait_for_cmd_done().
See if this fixes it. If it does, look in the header and send a patch
to the current maintainer. FYI, I use this driver with no problems
on 2.4.18 -- but I have commented-out that call because there, in fact,
might be no command to wait for and I got spurious messages.
Cheers,
