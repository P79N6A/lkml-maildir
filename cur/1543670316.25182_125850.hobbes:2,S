If you really want to examine the remains of a compromise, boot from a 
CD-based distro or something like that, and mount the partitions 
read-only.
If you don't want to, or have no idea what you're looking at, as Alan 
said, recover and verify user data, then reformat and reinstall.

Oh, yes. If you were running tripwire, and being good about keeping the 
database somewhere on read-only media, you might be able to detect file 
modifications. Place emphasis on might.

I'm trying to think up one of those odd situations ...
