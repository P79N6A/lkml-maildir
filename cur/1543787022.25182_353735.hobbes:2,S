I work a lot with hardware any my experience is that memtest is not very 
good at detecting errors. I have a Socket 7 board somewhere with bad L2 
cache - it was unstable but memtest was unable to find anything. 
However, GoldMemory found some errors - they disappeared after disabling 
L2 cache and crashes disappeared too. It's not free but at least 
shareware - you can find it at 
http://www.goldmemory.cz/
 The older 
version (IIRC 5.07) was better, I had problems with some of the newer 
ones on perfectly OK hardware (when the test should start, it rebooted 
instead).
