This is do to a bug in the rtc-ppc driver.  It is not PS3 specific, but
will affect all powerpc machines that use the rtc-ppc driver and have it
built as a loadable module.
Normally, udev will automatically load drivers for the devices present in the
system.  The info udev uses to autoload the driver is not provided by the
rtc-ppc driver, so when it is build as a loadable module udev can't figure
out which driver to load.
Here is some discussion Geert and I had:

It can be solved...
If the creation of the "ppc-rtc" platform device would be moved to builtin
core code (e.g. arch/powerpc/kernel/setup-common.c?), and drivers/rtc/rtc-ppc.c
would become a real platform driver that binds to the "ppc-rtc" platform
device, then it would be autoloaded by udev.
