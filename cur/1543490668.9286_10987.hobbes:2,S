If you're getting cache thrashing, then try the crude page colouring
patch I wrote. It's part of my MSR patch:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
It adds an ioctl() to /proc/<pid>/mem to turn on page colouring. The
appended programme allows you to run another programme with page
colouring enabled.
Further, if you want to figure out what is actually happening, my MSR
patch includes a performance monitoring driver so you can measure
cache hits and misses.
