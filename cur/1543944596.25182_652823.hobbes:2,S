Well, it's worse than this. After 7 or 8 bisections (all flagged
bad) the symptoms changed: the system boots up to the point where
it does not recognize LVM volumes. So there are at least 3 bugs:
1) the timeout on interrupts (only seen on hdb)
2) the empty DMA table messages (seen on hda and hdb)
3) the inability to see logical volumes ("pvs" does not find them,
  they are back when rebooting into 2.6.24). This is the apparently
  the earliest introduced bug (no problems with the disks with that
  version).
I am away from that machine until next Tuesday. IIRC the last git
bisect was something like 160 revisions left.
