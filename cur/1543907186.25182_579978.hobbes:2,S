Because I
(1) use the latest BIOS and
(2) I'm able to wake up a suspended system via <Fn> under Windows XP (yes, dual
    boot system I need it at work) regardless whether I previously hibernated
    the system (under Windows XP) or not
I bisected this regression (rather of a feature than a bug, or ?) between
the 2 tags v2.6.19 and v2.6.20 (~2400 commits, I read a good book in the
meanwhile) and found :
last good commit : 7e244322cd4ea361ef9ee623b3fcb4d9f4ff841c
first bad commit: cfee47f99bc14a6d7c6b0be2284db2cef310a815
I double checked these 2 commits - here's the first commit after which <Fn>
doesn't wake up my system from suspend state after it was (at least one time
before) hibernated:
