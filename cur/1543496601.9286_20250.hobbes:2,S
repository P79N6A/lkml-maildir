You need to add a #define __HAVE_ARCH_MEMMOVE to
include/asm-alpha/string.h.
Also, your patch seems to be broken.  Sometimes it doesn't copy enough.  
I had the same bug in my hacked version, before I made it into a patch,
and it was something like:
while (count--) {
	...
}
turning into
while (count -= 8) {
	...
}
instead of
while (count) {
	count -= 8;
	...
}
I can't see any of that in that patch, but scrolling around with emacs,
sometimes an 'if' turns into a 'ff'.  Linus, I've left you on the cc list
for this message so that you know not to apply the patch in the previous
one.
Tim.
