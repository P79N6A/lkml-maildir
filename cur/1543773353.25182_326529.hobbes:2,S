What does:  xfs_db -r -c 'inode 4207214' -c print /dev/XXX
report?
I have seen a similar thing once before, awhile back, where the
directory inode was "empty" (only . and ..) and hence should've
been in shortform, but other fields indicated the inode was in
extent form still.  Never got to the bottom of it... I'd guess
there's somehow a case where the kernel XFS code can miss this
transformation - not sure where/how though.
If it comes to it, you can always zero out individual inode fields
for that inode in xfs_db (with -x option to enable write mode) and
then xfs_repair should be able to get past it.
cheers.
