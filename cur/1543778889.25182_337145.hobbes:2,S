Each file system must be able to echo it's own FS specific options, 
hence the show_options hook (XFS is a good example). EXT3 has it's own 
form of journalled quota file options, hence the need for the specific hook.
The "older style" (e.g. "usrquota", "grpquota", "quota") could be done 
generically but a FS might want any number of quota options. The few 
lines of code in each file system didn't seem so bad especially if the 
show_function start echoing more.
