Subject: Filesystem bug?  "sync" hangs...

Kernel 2.4.7-pre3 on alpha.
The initial phase of an RPM build is unpacking a tarball and applying
patches, which is a bunch of writes followed by a update of read/write
updates.  A lot of write activity, basically.  RPM build is running at
normal priority as a normal user.
In another xterm, su'd in a shell that is renice'd to -14, I run "sync"
during all this write activity.  It hangs for 17 seconds before I get
impatient, stop counting, and suspend the RPM build process.  sync
continues to block, not returning to the command prompt.  I run dmesg
(generated read activity?), and sync finally returns.
The RPM build process continues unpacking/writing files without
appearing to slow in window 1 while sync blocks in window 2.
I have not seen this behavior before, but I do not recall trying 'sync'
specifically during heavy write activity before.  This behavior is
reproducible.
