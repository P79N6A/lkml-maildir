I totally agree, of course, but...

how can you be sure it will be the shell's memory ? after an exec, the
new process replaces the shell with the same pid. If it overwrites the
same address space, there's a possibility that /proc/self/mem, once
openned, still points to the same structure which will reflect the new
process's space after exec(). I'm afraid I'll have to test it.
