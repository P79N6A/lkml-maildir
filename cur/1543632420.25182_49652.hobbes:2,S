I currently have three problems with kbuild 2.5:
1. make TAGS doesn't work.
2. NO_MAKEFILE_GEN is unsupported and therefore likely to stop working
   in future kernels. The documentation says:
        Bug reports against kbuild when you used NO_MAKEFILE_GEN will
        be ignored.
   NO_MAKEFILE_GEN is about 8.4 times faster when you want to create a
   single .o file on my 2.2GHz P4 system. It doesn't matter that much
   on a fast machine, but my old PPro 200MHz machine required
   something like 40s just to process the makefiles.
3. You have to remember the "-f Makefile-2.5" arguments to make,
   otherwise it will use the old makefile system. This seems to mess
   things up so that subsequent make commands fail.
   I tried to "mv Makefile-2.5 Makefile" to overcome this problem, but
   it doesn't work because the original Makefile appears to be needed
   for extracting kernel version information.
