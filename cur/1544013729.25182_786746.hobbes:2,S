I've also had cases where one particular spot on the drive is bad. any 
attempt to read that sector fails and causes the drive to error out until 
a reboot. grabbing individual files I could skip the file(s) in the 
affected portion and retreive everything else on the drive (or in some 
cases raid array with multiple failures)
