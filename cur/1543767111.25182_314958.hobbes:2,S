Sure, quoting your initial mail:
/----------------------------------------------------------------------
| 2. Sysfs SAS Domain
| -------------------
|
| Represent everything which "sits out there" in the SAS
| domain, irrespective of how you connect to it.
|
| /sys/bus/sas/
| /sys/bus/sas/<WWN_ta0>/
| /sys/bus/sas/<WWN_ta0>/phys/
|
| ...
\----------------------------------------------------------------------
Here you have a global hiearchy.  We are not interested in that, though -
we only care for what's visible from a certain HBA.

Same as with fibre channel, and that's fine and expected.

Absolutely.
