Keith,
Thanks for the quick reply. I understand the need for having the module 
symbols in early for debugging purposes.  However, I'm not sure I see what 
the invalid state of the module symbols has to do with the problem. 
Now I'm assuming you're saying the module symbols are invalid because the  
initialisation function has yet to complete.  Please correct me if I'm 
wrong.  For this reason shouldn't another concurrent call to 
"sys_init_module" wait or be prevented from invoking the "init_module" 
function of a module that is dependent on the first module until the 
first module has its initialisation complete?  For debugging purposes 
"query_module" should still be able to see the symbols and other relevant 
data of the first module but no module dependent on the first 
uninitialised module should ever be loaded. 
Anyway, at this point I'm still not certain I've completely grasped your 
reply. Maybe I didn't make my first email clear.  If this is so, then 
what I was saying is that the invocation of "init_module" functions of 
*dependent* modules needs be appropriately serialised.  Right now 
"sys_init_module" is relying on the big kernel lock to completely 
serialise these calls but if any "init_module" function blocks, the 
kernel lock is released and this serialisation can be broken.  Maybe one 
way to avoid this is to check the flags of modules depended on during 
"sys_init_module". So if the MOD_RUNNING flag is not set for the module 
we depend on, then the module currently being loaded must have its 
invocation of "sys_init_module" wait or return an appropriate error 
indicating why.
