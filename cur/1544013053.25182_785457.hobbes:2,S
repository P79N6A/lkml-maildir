Indeed, the floppy motor keeps on running.
I added some debug code and got this:
	floppy_off: nr = 0x40000000
	floppy_off: mod motor_off_timer 0 jiffies + 3*HZ
	fd_motor_off: drive = 0xc0000000

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
