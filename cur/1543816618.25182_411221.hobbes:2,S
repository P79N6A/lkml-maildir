    True, but that's the point.  People break into systems with
passwords.  Just because passwords aren't 100% effective in
protecting systems doesn't mean we don't use them.  :-)
    The point is to "minimize" a vulnerability profile.
    I'm wondering why unused code is required to be compiled
in to standard kernels.  It seems very un-linux like -- more like
Windows that has support for everything compiled in.
    Reducing code bloat is not just a good idea for embedded systems.
It's good for performance and security if for no other reason that
there are fewer lines that could go wrong. :-)
