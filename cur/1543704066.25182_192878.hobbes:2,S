Did you try the installers from 
http://www.sh.nu/download/nvidia/
 ?
 
http://minion.de
 refers to them, and they appear to work fine here.

Wrong (or no) module-init-tools?  Mine currently is 
module-init-tools-3.0-0.pre5.2mdk from the Mandrake cooker, although I've not 
had trouble for some time with any version.  The nvidia.ko file is the one 
that will load under a 2.6 kernel.  The wrong format message sounds like you 
don't have module-init-tools installed, although I would expect getting your 
nvidia card to run would be the least of your problems.
You could also switch over in your XFConfig-4 to the nv driver that is part of 
the kernel build.  That should get your system running with X, letting you 
solve the nvidia driver problems later.

What messages do you get about what is going wrong?  What happens when you so 
a modprobe nvidia?  What does your log file from XFree show?
