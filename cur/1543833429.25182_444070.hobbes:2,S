hmm, slightly, I would say much harder and these weird interactions are
very hard to anticipate without some experience in the field. We could
continue on arguing for ages without making any progress.
let's apply that incremental development approach now. Let's work on simple
namespaces which would make _some_ container scenarios possible and not
all. IMHO, that would mean tying some namespaces together and find a way to
unshare them safely as a whole. Get some experience on it and then work on
unsharing some more independently for the benefit of more use case
scenarios. I like the concept and I think it will be useful.
just being pragmatic, i like things to start working in simple cases before
over optimizing them.
cheers,
C.
