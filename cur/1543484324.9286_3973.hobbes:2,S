This thread isn't about going from 2.0 to 2.2; it's about going from
2.0.33 to 2.0.34.  In the past, changes such as this caused major
compatibility headaches; this must be prevented from happening in the
future if Linux expects to get anywhere.

Again, this isn't what has happened in the past; people have *reordered*
*structure* *members*.  This isn't fixing a bug!  This is randomly and
gratuitously breaking binary compatibility *in* *a* *stable* *release*
for no benefit!  THIS is what must stop happening if Linux expects to
get anywhere.

Actually, this whole thread started because one developer I know kept
getting the SCSI interface changed out from under him, again, *in* *a*
*stable* *release*; therefore, it is certainly linux-scsi related.
