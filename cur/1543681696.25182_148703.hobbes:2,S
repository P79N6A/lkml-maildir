OK, I did that.  I put two messages in both functions of the maestro3 driver. 
I suspended/resumed the machine. Both functions had been called.
This time, I did NOT have 'artsd' (i.e. the client) loaded. What happened was 
that the module was properly restored and I could load (and use) artsd even 
after the resume.
That brings me to the first assumption/question I have made: is there 
something wrong if we suspend two parts (one module and a userspace process), 
while they inter-communicate through the /dev/* interface?
static void m3_suspend(m3_t *chip)
{
	snd_card_t *card = chip->card;
	int i, index;
	snd_printk("m3 suspend");
	if (chip->suspend_mem == NULL)
		return;
	if (card->power_state == SNDRV_CTL_POWER_D3hot)
		return;
	...
static void m3_resume(m3_t *chip)
{
	snd_card_t *card = chip->card;
	int i, index;
	snd_printk("m3 resume");
	if (chip->suspend_mem == NULL)
		return;
	...
