Ok, thank you for enlightening me on that. So defaults are chosen first 
from defconfig, and then from Kconfig for options not present in 
defconfig.
I guess I should limit myself to i386 for this or maybe just abandon it 
alltogether. 
It still seems like a good idea though to make the defaults (at least on 
i386) match the help text recommendations, but if defconfig is used over 
Kconfig and defconfig is more or less off-limits, and changing Kconfig 
would result in wrong defaults on other archs (which would then cause more 
work for arch maintainers with updating their defconfig), then maybe it's 
really not such a good idea after all to go about changing this.
I'll stay away from making these changes for now unless I run across some 
really obvious and non-problematic cases.
