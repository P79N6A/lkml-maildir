   So what do you use then in user space to reliably allocate memory?
   As to me - memory is a resource. Is it virtual or is it physical - it 
is still resource. And I need to allocate part of this resource.
   malloc() uses brk() inside. But brk() is "implementation details". I 
honestly do not care about them - I just want to be sure that what ever 
resource I have allocated - I can use it afterwards until I shall free 
it. POSIX even doesn't mention brk() BTW.
   If you can hint me any other method to allocate memory without 
surprises - I will really appreciate.

   Embedded? with swap?!?
   What you have smoken?! - take me to your dealer!-)))
   And btw Rik already gave me answer - 2.6 kernels + 
/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory == 2.
   Work charmfully ;-)
   Enjoy.

  Because the kernel depends on it existing. "init"          |_|*|_|
  literally _is_ special from a kernel standpoint,           |_|_|*|
  because its' the "reaper of zombies" (and, may I add,      |*|*|*|
  that would be a great name for a rock band).
