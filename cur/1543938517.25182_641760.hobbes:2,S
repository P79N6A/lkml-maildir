My opinion is that I want it done properly (PIC and all that jazz) or 
not at all, and certainly would not want to mix linear and 
paging-enabled code in the same file.  When it comes to assembly code, 
at least people can *see* that there there be dragons.
The plus *and* minus of a C version is that it's easier for people to 
modify.  The plus side of that is that if we really need it, it's a lot 
cleaner; the minus side is that it may encourage more code to creep into 
the pre-paging code, which would not be a good thing IMO.
