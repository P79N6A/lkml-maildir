Subject: [PATCH 2/5] netpoll: revert queue stopped change
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/26/544

From: Jeff Moyer <jmoyer@redhat.com>
Here's the first of the broken out patch set.  This puts the check for
netif_queue_stopped back into netpoll_send_skb.  Network drivers are not
designed to have their hard_start_xmit routines called when the queue is
stopped.
