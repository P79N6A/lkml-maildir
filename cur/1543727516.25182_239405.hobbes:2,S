I hear you, these are all desirable things and I hate trying to be the black
sheep - but would random.c make sense in being the exception since the
outward looking interfaces (random_write for example) all use const char*
type as arguments?
Keeping the existing random.c interface and using crypto-api's scatter-gather
interface are kind of contradictory ... or and I really missing something
important (likely)?
