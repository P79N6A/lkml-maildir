Mark,
I checked a later kernel and it can get stuck. However, you can
use sleep_on_timeout() to make sure you do get awakened. A
check of something the interrupt should have written will let you
know what happened, i.e,...
	spin_lock_irqsave(&device_lock, flags);
	if(irq_flag)
        {
           spin_unlock_irqrestore(&device_lock, flags);
           //// You already got interrupted, fix this first!
           spin_lock_irqsave(&device_lock, flags);
        }
        irq_flag = 0;
        tickle_hardware();    /* Interrupts are off */
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&device_lock, flags);
        interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(&wait, time * HZ);
	spin_lock_irqsave(&device_lock, flags);
        if(irq_flag)
             /// Was interrupted
        else
             /// Was not
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&device_lock, flags);
isr()
{
    irq_flag = 1; 
    wake_up_interruptible(&wait);
}
Just check program flow under a spin-lock and it should be safe
in SMP. Keep the code under the locks short. I have a GPIB driver
which will have to be modifed once a new kernel is released. It
does about 100,000 interrupts per second without losing data, but
it won't even compile with a new kernel because some types have
changed. So I haven't done anything with it recently.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
