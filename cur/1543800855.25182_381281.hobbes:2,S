Doing things in userspace does not necessarily mean doing them in a
library, especially when it is required that the library be shared,
also known as "things _will_ break".
Especially since it tends to hide the real, user-accessible kernel
interface which has very, very annoying security implications.  At
that point, the ALSA kernel-userspace interface seems entirely
un-reviewed by the kernel people who have an eye for race conditions,
wandering userland pointers, information leaks, out-of-range accesses
and this kind of things (no patches from Al Viro on alsa?) and that
does not really give me a warm and fuzzy feeling.  And even if it is
reviewed at time t, it looks like it may change anytime a driver
author thinks it would help.  Not good at all.
