This is write coalescing, not caching - the synchronous requirement
means the write-through cache has to put data to the stable store before
it returns. it is that simple - do not try to read more into it than that.
i could have a 100 write requests come in, and none of the writes can be
acknowledged until the data for that write is on stable store. that is what
the RFC says -
  "When a procedure returns to the client, the client can
   assume that the operation has completed and any data associated with
   the request is now on stable storage."
remember this is with regards to write server-caching is not allowed in
NFSv2, read server-caching is fine.

i have no dispute how you handle client-side caching, it is not specified.
the only question you should worry about is the consistency guarantees of
your system. you need some extra measure to get strong consistency using
NFS.
