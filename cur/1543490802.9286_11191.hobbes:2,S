	the problem *could* be with mismatched kernel versions .i.e the
kernel headers which you have used in your modules and the headers that
were used to compile the kernel running on your system are different.
if that is the case, then, you have to get the proper headers .i.e. the
ones that were used by your running kernel. you can risk a possible panic
by forcing module load using the ' -f' option of insmod.
	out of curiosity, which 'snippet' are you trying to insert. i have
had no major problems with the O reilly examples.
						cheers, action.
