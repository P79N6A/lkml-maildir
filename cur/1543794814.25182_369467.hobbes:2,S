Hi,
My 2.6.14 system occasionally crashes; gives a kernel panic. Of course I
would like to report it. Now the system locks up hard so I can't copy
the stacktrace. The crash dump patches mentioned in oops-tracing.txt all
don't work for 2.6.14 it seems. So: what should I do? Get my digicam and
take a picture of the display?
