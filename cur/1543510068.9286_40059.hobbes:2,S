Hi,
because of the p->dumpable check in `proc_pid_fill_inode'
(fs/proc/base.c), binaries that are set[ug]id are not permitted to
open "/proc/self/mem" (since this is owned by 0.0 in this case). Is
this a bug, or am I just missing the rationale for this?
Simple testcase:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
int main()
{
  char *name = "/proc/self/mem";
  FILE *f;
  struct stat st;
  stat(name, &st);
  printf("%s uid %d gid %d\n", name, st.st_uid, st.st_gid);
  f = fopen(name, "r");
  if (f)
    fclose(f);
  else
    perror("open");
  return 0;
}
