Too late last night for me to realise this, I don't use ext3!  The Oops 
came after all active partitions loaded, 'cos that's when the network 
started (last good dmesg entries before oops).
That might explain why you didn't see this problem your site?
I use ext2 (for small partitions, floppy) and reiserfs 3.6 here, 
they're compiled in and generally dos, vfat, ntfs, iso9660 as 
modules where required. 
Grant.
