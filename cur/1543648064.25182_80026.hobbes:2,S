Actually, I did, for those comments that made sense.  The fs/Config.in
logic has been cleaned up, as well as removing excess header files,
stray LINUX_VERSION_CODE #ifdef's that I had missed the first time
around, etc.
fs/mbcache.c is still there because it applies to both ext2 and ext3
filesystems, and so your suggestion of moving it into the ext2 and
ext3 directories would cause code duplication and maintenance
headaches.  It also *can* be used by other filesystems, as it is
written in a generic way.  The fs/Config.in only compiles it in if
necessary (i.e., if ext2/3 extended attribute is enabled) so it won't
cause code bloat for other filesystems if it is not needed.
The superblock fields are more of an issue with the posix acl changes
than for the extended attribute patches.  I had wanted to get the
extended attribute changes in first, since they stand alone, and so I
have fewer patches to juggle.
