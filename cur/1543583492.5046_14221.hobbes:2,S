  As the original author of the slab allocator, I can assure you there is
nothing guaranteed about "offset".  Neither is it to do with any minimum.
  The original idea behind offset was for objects with a "hot" area
greater than a single L1 cache line.  By using offset correctly (and to my
knowledge it has never been used anywhere in the Linux kernel), a SLAB
cache creator (caller of kmem_cache_create()) could ask the SLAB for more
than one colour (space/L1 cache lines) offset between objects.
  As no one uses the feature it could well be broken, but is that a reason
to change its meaning?
