For current kernels, the "official" method is to have cleaned up copies 
of the kernel headers shipped with glibc and placed in 
/usr/include/linux and /usr/include/asm.  The "real" headers will often 
work, but not always,
To complicate things, if you add new stuff to the kernel (new ioctl 
commands, etc.) then your app needs to either link against the "real" 
headers, or else duplicate the definitions.
Its kind of a mess.
In an ideal world there would be clean "userspace" headers shipped with 
the kernel, and the kernel would then use those headers plus the 
kernel-only stuff.
