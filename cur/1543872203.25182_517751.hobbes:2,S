Yes, specific_send_sig_info/__group_send_sig_info "ignores" the non-RT signal
	- if we already have a pending one (blocked, or not yet handled)
	- the only reason is backward compatibility
signalfd:
	- if the same signr was not fetched via sys_signalfd_dequeue()
	- the reason is ????
Suppose we are doing a simple application which just logs all signals
which were sent to this process. Now, we can miss the signal if the
logging blocks.
Think about sub-threads. We can send the same non-RT signal to T1, T2, T3
via specific_send_sig_info(). All 3 signals will be delivered, but signalfd
(which is process wide) will see only the first.

Ugh. Still can't understand, probably I missed something or misread this patch.
If we shift signalfd_notify() from specific_send_sig_info/__group_send_sig_info
to send_signal(), we have the same "list_empty()" fastpath if no signalfds are
attached to the sighand. The difference is that we don't count sig_ignored()
signals, which looks right to me.
