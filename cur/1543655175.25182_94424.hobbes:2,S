I have bothered you few months ago that the following Geode modules:
Centarus platform, GX1 300 MHz, 5530A REv B1, BIOS: XpressROM V3.0.1 build 03/08/2001 by NatSemi
were crashing about once a week running 2.4.17 with low latency, HZ=2000,
ext3fs.
Since then I have upgraded to 2.4.19-rc3 with similar configuration and the
boards are running OK since a few months.
Best regards,
