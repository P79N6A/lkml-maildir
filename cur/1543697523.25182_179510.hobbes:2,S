Because the kernel depends on it existing. "init" literally _is_ special 
from a kernel standpoint, because its' the "reaper of zombies" (and, may I 
add, that would be a great name for a rock band).
So without init, the kernel wouldn't have anybody to fall back on when a 
parent process dies, and would become very very unhappy. Historically it 
actually oopsed the kernel.
UNIX semantics literally _require_ that "getppid()" should return 1 if 
your parent dies, and that's "current->p_parent->tgid". So we have to have 
a parent with pid 1, and thus init really _is_ special.
Yeah, we could have _other_ special cases (we could create another process 
that is invisible and has pid 1), but the fact is, _some_ special case is 
required. It might as well be "you can't kill init".
