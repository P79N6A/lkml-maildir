Same problem here with a dual PIII, 1GB RAM, BTW, I'm uncompressing
kernel to build the 2.6.1-mm2 kernel, and preemption is not doing a very
good job, xmms (using xmms-alsa) skips for about 1 second every 5 secs
or so.

I dont have that problem, using nvidia propietary module, or the xfree
nv one.
Are you sure you didnt change the keyboard recently ?? maybe xfree is
misconfigured, because that happened to me because of a miscofiguration
of a new keyboard.
