>   o remove hugetlb syscalls
So finally they did it ...
But mmap(NULL, ...) is not yet supported, this is really sad.
And arch/i386/Kconfig and Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt still document
the sys_alloc_hugepages()/sys_free_hugepages() syscalls.
A simple program that doesnt know at all how the memory is layed out by
kernel/glibc can not easily get some 4Mo pages in a single syscall.
sys_alloc_hugepage() was very convenient for that.
Another problem :
if you mount hugetlbfs in /huge, then create a file /huge/BIG of size 4Mo,
then use :
dd if=/huge/BIG of=/dev/null
the dd process hangs on 'D' state : the read() syscall just hang forever.
Thanks
