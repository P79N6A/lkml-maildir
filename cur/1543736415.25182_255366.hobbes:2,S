You won't run into it with suspend2 because it doesn't use high order
allocations. There might be one exception, but apart from that, all of
suspend2's data is stored in order zero allocated pages, so
fragmentation is not an issue. This is the real solution to the problem.
I had to do it this way because I aim to have suspend work without
eating any memory.

Normal usage; the pattern of pages being freed and allocated inevitably
leads to fragmentation. The buddy allocator does a good job of
minimising it, but what is really needed is a run-time defragmenter. I
saw mention of this recently, but it's probably not that practical to
implement IMHO.

Apart from the above, no, sorry.
