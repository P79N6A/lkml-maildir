Subject: out of vmalloc space - but vmalloc parameter does not allow boot

Greetings,
(Please CC responses as I am not subscribed to the list. Thanks!)
I've recently started experiencing the following problem on one of my
Linux servers:
allocation failed: out of vmalloc space - use vmalloc=<size> to increase
size.
allocation failed: out of vmalloc space - use vmalloc=<size> to increase
size.
XFS: possible memory allocation deadlock in kmem_alloc (mode:0x2d0)
XFS: possible memory allocation deadlock in kmem_alloc (mode:0x2d0)
...and so on until it completely locks up and needs reboot.
>From what I can tell from fs/xfs/linux-2.6/kmem.c, the XFS message is
just another confirmation that the machine has run out of vmalloc space.
The machine has 4GB of RAM and is running 2.6.11.5 kernel.
I have tried to specify vmalloc=256m to start with, but no luck - the
machine does not even want to boot. It panics with:
EXT2-fs: unable to read superblock
isofs_fill_super: bread failed, dev=md0, iso_blknum=16, block=32
XFS: SB read failed
VFS: Cannot open root device "md0" or unknown-block(9,0)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-
block(9,0)
If I remove the "vmalloc" parameter, it boots just fine but then after
some hours, when the load on the server goes up, I get the above
"request" to increase vmalloc. Being desperate to find the way out, I
have also tried increasing the hardcoded value in arch/i386/mm/init.c,
but ended up with the same effect as with the parameter - panic on boot.
/proc/meminfo says (while the system is up and running):

I have also tried changing the following parameters - but no luck
either:
vm.lower_zone_protection = 900
vm.min_free_kbytes = 30000
vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 150
Please help! What am I doing wrong?
Also, if this question does not belong here - please point to the right
direction :).
Best regards,
Ranko
