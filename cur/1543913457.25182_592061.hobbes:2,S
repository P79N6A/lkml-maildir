Mlock can cause the problem too.  As for all_unreclaimable,
it is ignored when priority == DEF_PRIORITY, balance_pgdat
always seems to start in this stage.

This is done so the system does not end up with the first
process that goes into page reclaim staying there forever,
while the other processes in the system happily consume
the pages freed by that poor first process.
There may be other reasons, too.
