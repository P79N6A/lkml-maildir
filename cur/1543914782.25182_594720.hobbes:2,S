Duplicate options with different names in different menus, but which all
do the same, --- is this the best for users?

FireWire hardware which implements SBP-2 is SCSI hardware...  But this
detail aside --- yes, of course this help text is old and misleading.

It affects every hardware which is driven by scsi low-level providers
which have been integrated with the SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC facility.

True.
So,
    config SCSI_CONSTANTS
        "Kernel log messages from the SCSI subsystem will be easier to
        understand if you say Y here..."
would say what this option really does.  But to some degree the need to
explain what the SCSI subsystem or SCSI core is and which other
subsystems make use of it remains.  Maybe it's OK to provide
documentation of this kind outside of Kconfig help though.

Difficult.  Does e.g. hardware sold as SAS count as "sold as SCSI"?  How
about SBP-2 then?  ;-)
