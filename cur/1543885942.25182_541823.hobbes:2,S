This was introduced by Ingo to solve a real problem that I found,
where some codepath would hold the BKL for long enough to introduce
excessive scheduling latencies - search list archive for details.  But
I don't remember the code path (scrolling the FB console?  VT
switching? reiser3?  misc. ioctl()s?).  Basically, taking the BKL
disabled preemption which caused long latencies.
It's certainly possible that whatever issue led to this was solved in
another way since.
