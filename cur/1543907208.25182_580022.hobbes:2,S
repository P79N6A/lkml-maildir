Or disable ZONE_MOVABLE until it is usable? I don't think we have the
infrastructure to really use it anyways, so it shouldn't make too much difference
in terms of features. And it's not that there is some sort of deadline
around for it. 
Or mark it CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL with a warning that it'll break NUMA. But disabling 
is probably better.
Then for .24 or .25 a better solution can be developed.
I would prefer that instead of merging bandaid horrible hacks -- they have
a tendency to stay around.
