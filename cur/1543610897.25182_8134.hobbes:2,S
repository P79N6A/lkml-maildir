No no, I love binary math :)

If You set this directly to cpus_allowed You're going to set the logical
one.
This because cpus_allowed is logical, because it's used like, ie:
int this_cpu = p->processor;
if (p->cpus_allowed & (1 << this_cpu)) ...
and p->processor is logical.
Something like :
unsigned long num2log_mask(unsigned long cmsk) {
	unsigned long msk = 0;
	int ii;
	for (ii = 0; ii < smp_num_cpus; ii++)
		if (cmsk & (1 << ii))
			msk |= (1 << cpu_logical_map(ii));
	return msk;
}
unsigned long log2num_mask(unsigned long cmsk) {
	unsigned long msk = 0;
	int ii;
	for (ii = 0; ii < smp_num_cpus; ii++)
		if (cmsk & (1 << ii))
			msk |= (1 << cpu_number_map(ii));
	return msk;
}
You use num2log_mask() on the user input mask to set cpus_allowed and
log2num_mask() to return the map to the user.
