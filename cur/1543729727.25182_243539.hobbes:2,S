Drivers for hardware with partial PCI decoding need to at least add a
call to pci_remove_rom() to remove the rom attribute from sysfs. I
don't know which hardware has this problem or even if any hardware with
a Linux driver has this problem. If anyone is maintainer for a driver
like this, please let me know and I can add the call to
pci_remove_rom().
Also, I believe the i386 quirk should also be applied to the x86_64
arch. I don't have the hardware and I don't know enough about the boot
aequence in 64 bits to do the right thing with a guess. The code is not
broken for x86_64, it just may not pick up the right ROM image on that
architecture.
