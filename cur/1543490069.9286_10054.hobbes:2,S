U.S. law forbids crypto exports, even if it is already widely
available.  However, "the net interprets censorship as damage and
routes around it": the right thing to do is to *not* put DES in the
kernel, but to make sure than anything that can benefit from
"transparent data transformation" works with the patch at
www.kerneli.org.
