I can see the value in these system calls, but I agree that the 
implementation is crude. "EBADF" is not something that applications are 
taught to expect. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I can think of no 
situation under which a file descriptor currently gets yanked out from 
under your feet -- you should always have to formally abandon it with 
close().
This kind of thing only looks proper if it leaves the file descriptor in 
place and just returns errors / EOF when you attempt to access it.
Thanks,
Chase
