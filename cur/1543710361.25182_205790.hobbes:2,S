I uploaded my latest status, there are three patches, the first is
Dave's objrmap, the second is your anobjrmap-1, the third is my anon_vma
work that removes the pte_chains all over the kernel.
my patch is not stable yet, it crashes during swapping and the debugging
code catches bug even before swapping (which is good):

I hope to make it work tomorrow, then the next two things to do are the
pagetable walk in the nonlinear (currently it's pinned) and the rbtree
(or prio_tree) for the i_mmap{,shared}. Then it will be complete and
mergeable.
