I'm running linux-2.2.18 and linux-2.4.0-prerelease on my laptop (p3-550,
440BX chipset). The machine dualboots with windows 2000, installed on
/dev/hda2 with NTFS. /dev/hda2 (as reported with fdisk) has 4707045
blocks. However, under linux-2.4.0-prerelease (and under
2.4.0-test13-pre3) df reports  37656356 1k blocks, which is clearly wrong
(the whole disk is 12GB long :). This doesn't happen under linux-2.2.18.
I'm sorry to spam everyone if this has already been reported. I'm be
willing to apply any patch and try everything etc. Please CC me if you
reply, because I'm not subscribed to the list.
Cheers,
