I can't speak for the others but according to my Wyse 50
manual the S.SAVER feature in the field level 4 menu
has a default value of OFF.
My recollection is that this was common among the VDTs which
suffered considerably from burn-in.  Many of the later
models had the feature but it was a hardware setting
controlled via a configuration menu or a dip-switch.  You
want the setting to persist across logins and power cycling.
It really should be disabled in-kernel by default.  The
distribution RC scripts would as a default then enable it
late in the boot process.  In a server setting where it
isn't wanted the admin should know enough to prevent its
being enabled.
I too have been bitten by this on servers where the console
display is either powered down or disconnected for months at
a time.  The error messages leading to the hang may be in
the display buffer but they can't be seen.
