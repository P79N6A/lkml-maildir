Still on it...
I asked some other people who all could confirmed that after copying
much data (>=1-2GB) to/from a usb disk, the copy/tar/ whatever will
freeze and then you'll have to reconnect the device to use it again
(in my case with devfs the old entries still exist and the second time
it become sdb)
Is it really still a problem to use mass storage under Linux?
Greetings,
Nico
