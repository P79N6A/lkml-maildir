    It's probably better to produce a patch when the kernel won't
    compile, but surely it's better that when something goes belly up
    and stays dead that people should complain bitterly about it instead
    of just quietly shuffling off to the -ac stable branch.

    david parsons \bi/       If people can't complain, it's stopped being a
                   \/  development branch but is instread a research branch.
