I think making jiffies a non l-value is good, but this drops volatile
attribute from jiffies (since jiffies_64 is not volatile).  It might
break some codes which do polling on jiffies.
Something like this would be better?
#if defined(__BIG_ENDIAN) && BITS_PER_LONG == 32
#define jiffies (*((const volatile unsigned long *)&jiffies_64 + 1))
#else
#define jiffies (*(const volatile unsigned long *)&jiffies_64)
#endif
And if we do not want to depend on -fno-strict-aliasing, the union
would be The Only Neat Thing to Do.
