After fixing these parametres (make oldconfig did not set them), I still 
cannot boot 2.5.68. I've tried it with pci=noapci and also with apci=off, 
as the boot message suggestes.
I have a Dell Latitude Laptop with a Xircom Cardbus ethernet + modem card.
If I boot with the card inserted booting stops like this:
........
socket status = 30000006
Even SysRq does not work.
If I remove it I see:
socket status = 30000020
Intel PCIC probe: not found.
Unable to open initial console.
Kernel panic: No init found. Try passing init= option to kernel.
Here SysRq works.
I assume it must be a FAQ but cannot find it.
