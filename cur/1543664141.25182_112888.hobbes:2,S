Subject: [ATM] suni_init declared __init AND exported?

currently suni_init() in drivers/atm/suni.c is declared as 
int __init suni_init(struct atm_dev *dev)
{
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(suni_init);
with 2.4 kernels this works fine since __init goes away for
modules.  however this seems to be a problem for 2.5 since
suni_init will be discarded after the suni module is loaded.
atm drivers calling suni_init() during their startup/load
oops since the suni_init() function is no longer available.
the __init should go away right?
