Everybody (ab)using PF_MEMALLOC or the new __GFP_EMERGENCY.

Keeping the free pages in the page allocator is good for the buddy
system. Although you could probably implement a reserve interface
without actually claiming the pages.
However, doing it like so separates the making of the reserve from the
actual kmem_cache object, I can just carry a sum of pages around instead
of a list of kmem_cache pointers.
I calculate a potential reserve, I might never actually commit to making
(and using) the reserve.
Also, I don't see what internals are exposed, kmem_cache is still
private to slab.c.
