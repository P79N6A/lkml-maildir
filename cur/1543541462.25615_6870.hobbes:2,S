Can't be done.
"/bin/mv", yes. Makes complete sense to move a full file with all
"subforks". It's actually very similar to a directory move.
But /bin/cp cannot do the same, at least not without teaching it to do
the same thing as for a recursive directory copy (which a regular UNIX
cp wouldn't even try to do on a regular file). But the recursive
directory copy approach should work.
At least in theory.
