   Maybe I got it the wrong way, but it seems to me that from your point of 
   view, as long as proprietary driver is in use, it's not anyone else 
   problem but to the vendor, even if the bug could happen to be in the 
   kernel, is that right? If so, everyone else in this list who could try 
   to fix this (again assuming it could be something related to the kernel 
   and not to the proprietary driver) necessarily share your oppinion? (I'm 
   not flaming in here, just trying to get the path).
This has to do with facts, not opinions.  Since we lack the source to
their drivers, we have no idea if some bug in their driver is
scribbling over (ie. corrupting) memory.  It is therefore an unknown
which makes it a waste of time for us to pursue the bug report.
