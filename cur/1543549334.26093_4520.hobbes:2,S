Hello,
With 2.4.0-test7, it was impossible for me to have my two PCMCIA sockets
running (2.2.x was OK). Only the socket 0 was working fine. I have
upgraded to 2.4.0-test9pre4 and pcmcia-cs-3.1.20 and I still have the
same problem. From my /var/log/messages, I get:
    Sep 20 16:06:10 qwerty cardmgr[383]: starting, version is 3.1.20
    Sep 20 16:06:11 qwerty rc: Starting pcmcia succeeded
    Sep 20 16:06:11 qwerty cardmgr[383]: watching 1 sockets
    Sep 20 16:06:11 qwerty kernel: cs: IO port probe 0x1000-0x17ff:
clean.
    Sep 20 16:06:11 qwerty kernel: cs: IO port probe 0x0100-0x04ff:
excluding 0x100-0x107 0x220-0x22f 0x250-0x257 0x330-0x337 0x378-0x37f
0x388-0x38f 0x408-0x40f 0x4d0-0x4d7
Correct me if I'm wrong, but would it be possible to try a polling
configuration to finally get the socket 1 working or this problem is
really a kernel side issue ?
Thanks again,
Claude.
