The common way to handle this is to simply keep the version that is now 
in the kernel.
If someone wants to send updates for a driver for review he can always 
do so. If they dont want to get their driver updated in the kernel it's 
their problem - and not a reason to reward them with a link to their 
site.
Oh, one reason why they don't want to submit their latest driver might 
be that their driver is using with binary-only code if you activate 
their ADSL or ATM code...
OTOH, I don't see a compelling reason for removing the version currently 
in the tree (part of the drivers is BROKEN, but even this doesn't do 
much harm).
