Chris is right. It is possible (not very likely, but possible
notheless) that the majority of the dirty pages are _active_
pages ... in that case page_launder() won't help one bit and
only flush_dirty_buffers() can do the job.
Also, you do not want the writer to block on writing out buffers
if bdflush could write them out asynchronously while the dirty
buffer producer can work on in the background.
