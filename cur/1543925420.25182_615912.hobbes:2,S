Not even as boot-time option?  I'm curious whether it might allow me
to use AHCI mode on a T60p laptop; right now I can't because in AHCI
mode the Ultrabay hard drive device becomes invisible to Linux
(although not to Windows, interestingly).  I'm currently travelling
and I don't carry the T60 around anymore, so I can't do the experiment
right this moment, but given that this would allow the T60 to take
advantage of ALPM if this works, it would be awfully tempting....
