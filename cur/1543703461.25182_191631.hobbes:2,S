Well, as I said, I would solve the "how" problem with a kernel module
which monitors mouse movement or keyboard events. This happens to be a
whole lot more reliable, and it will also eat no CPU time when nothing's
happening.
Plus, it will work on any mouse or keyboard. People actually _use_ USB
critters these days, you know ...
