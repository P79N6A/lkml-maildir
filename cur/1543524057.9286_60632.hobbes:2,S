Subject: Kernel 2.3.41 hd* lost IRQ problems - HPT366 IDE controller?

I had noticed a discussion recently on the list regarding lost irq's on 
the IDE bus. From the progression of the threads I had assumed that 
these problems were fixed.
The system I'm running is based on the ABIT BP6 motherboard. This has 
the HPT366 IDE controller which has been discussed extensively. Although 
this controller is on board I am not using it.
Whilst running the 2.3.41 kernel occaisionally the box will lose 
interrupt for hda or hdb.  When this happens I can do nothing except a 
hard reboot, and wait for fsck to finish.
I apologise if this is a known problem.
TIA
Steve
