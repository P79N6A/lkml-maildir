I think we agreed from a logical standpoint that those patches are correct
and needed, didn't we ?
Whether or not we encounter those races in our testing is to a certain
extent a matter of chance. I wouldn't use passing of all tests for ext2 
as a proof that they aren't needed. It just tells us that they may be
less likely.
