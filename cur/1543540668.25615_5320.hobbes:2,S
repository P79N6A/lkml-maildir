   Maybe you are right in theory. There are 3 things that make theory different
   from practice right now:
   1) Serial sysrq is reported no to work for 2.4 kernels. 
I haven't heard of any such reports.  I'm currently on the road right
now, so I can't test this right away.  If someone running 2.4.0test5 can
test this and confirm/deny this claim, I would appreciate it.   If it
doesn't work, full debugging particulars would be appreciate it.
   2) You cannot compile a 2.4-test kernel without CONFIG_VT but with 
      CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ right now; the dep_bool change is just making 
      this explicit.
If this is a case, this is a bug which should be fixed.
   3) Even 2.2.16 doesn't seem to contain code for Serial sysrq
Given that we're talking about the config.in file for the 2.4 tree, this
is somewhat irrelevant.  That being said, you can take the serial driver
code from 
http://serial.sourceforge.net
, and drop it into a 2.2 tree, at
which point you'll have all of the cool features that are in the 2.4
serial driver.  I've been busier with the 2.4 tree to send a patch to
Alan to get this into the latest 2.2 tree (it's on the queue....), but I
believe it should be stable enough for 2.2 inclusion, so please feel
free to use it in good health.
(And if you do use try using it on a 2.2 kernel, please send me back
positive and negative reports.  Positive reports are useful so I can be
more confident about submitting it to Alan as a 2.2 driver update.)
Thanks for your support.....
