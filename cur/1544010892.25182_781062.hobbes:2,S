Subject: [PATCH 0/8, v3] ensure symlinks are NUL-terminated
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

These patches fix potential bugs associated with link target handling by
NUL-terminating names read from disk.
This is version 3 of these patches. It fixes the bug, pointed out by Al Viro
and Evgeniy Dushistov, that i_size was not being validated. In order to
facilitate this it introduces a helper function for terminating the link name,
as suggested by Al.
