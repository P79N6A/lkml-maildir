Ehh... There _is_ a way to deal with that, but it's deeply Albertesque:
	* add pagecache access for block device
	* put your "real" root on /dev/loop0 (setup from initrd)
	* dd
The last step will populate pagecache for underlying device and later
access to root fs will ultimately hit said pagecache, be it from page
cache of files or buffer cache of /dev/loop0 - loop_make_request() will
take care of that, by copying data from pagecache of /dev/<real_device>.
