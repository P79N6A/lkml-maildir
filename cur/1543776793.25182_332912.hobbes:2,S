Eric, I can't really say I like this one. Not at least after extensive 
tests run on top of it. You are asking to add a bottleneck to save 8 bytes 
on an entity that taken alone in more than 120 bytes. Consider that when 
you have a "struct file" allocated, the cost on the system is not only the 
struct itself, but all the allocations associated with it. For example, if 
you consider that a case where you might feel a "struct file" pressure is 
when you have hundreds of thousands of network connections, the 8 bytes 
saved compared to all the buffers associated with those sockets boils down 
to basically nothing.
