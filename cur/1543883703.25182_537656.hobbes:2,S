"entirely polite all the time" is totally different from "cannot _ever_ 
be polite".
Also, quite frankly, in order to be impolite, you have to build up a 
certain amount of street-cred first. For example, Al Viro can afford to be 
very abrasive, because he's pretty much shown over the years that every 
single time he flames somebody, he's right.
Anyway, I'll get out of the discussion. There's clearly some personality 
issues in the DVB area, and I don't know quite _why_ that is, but Uwe, 
you're definitely not helping.
