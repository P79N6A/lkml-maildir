After diffing two of your .config's, I don't see how the CPU selection 
options might have caused this.
I'm sorry that I don't have a real idea where to search for the 
problems, only a few thoughts how to get nearer to finding it:
Please try 2.6.2-rc1 (without any -mm patch).
If this kernel works, please try -mm4 with disabled SMP support and
support for the Athlon (and no other CPUs).
If you compile with
  make V=1
the kernel build is more verbose. If this kernel doesn't boot, please 
send the complete gcc call for the compilation of a file (it doesn't 
matter which file, e.g. one under fs/).
