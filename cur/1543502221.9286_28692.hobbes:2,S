Hi all,
Other than /dev/profile, is there any mechanism available for
profiling the kernel?  For example, has anyone implemented a
__mcount() function to handle a kernel compiled with -pg, or is this
even possible?
We're currently profiling the kernel NFS daemon (the entire path from
network to disk) using SPECsfs and other benchmarking mechanisms, and
before I start working on a home-grown profiling mechanism I'd like to
make sure I'm not reinventing the wheel.
BTW: /proc/profile hasn't got enough granularity for our purposes and
doesn't provide info such as call-graph statistics.
Regards,
 Robert.
