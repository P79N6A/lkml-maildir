So something like:
WRITE FIRST PARTY DMA QUEUED BARRIER EXT
READ FIRST PARTY DMA QUEUED BARRIER EXT
READ DMA QUEUED BARRIER EXT
READ DMA QUEUED BARRIER
WRITE DMA QUEUED BARRIER
WRITE DMA QUEUED BARRIER EXT
...
If the drive receives a queued barrier write (NCQ or Legacy), it will
finish processing all previously-received queued commands and post
good status for them, then it will process the barrier operation, post
status for that barrier operation, then it will continue processing
queued commands in the order received.
Multiple barrier operations can be in the queue at the same time.  A
barrier operation has an implied FUA associated with it, such that the
command (and all previous-in-time commands) must be pushed to the
media before command completetion can be indicated.
Is that what would be most useful?
