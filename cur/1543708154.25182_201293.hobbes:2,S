Considering that this was somewhat of a dirty hack in the first place,
that ext3 already has the functionality through the commit mount option
and that 2.6 laptop mode I think the proper way would be to throw this
out and use the commit option instead. All it needs is the reset option
(use commit=0 to use the default file system value). This way among
other things it will be possible to use the same laptop mode script for
both 2.4 and 2.6.
I have a patch for that which is in a testing phase now (along with a
fix for reiserfs and xfs), I am a bit slow on it now due to test season
but I am hoping to publish it next week or something around that. I
will check with the guy doing the 2.6 laptop-mode patch to see whats
the state of the testing.
