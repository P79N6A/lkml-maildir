Here's the set of patches John promised :)
1/4: add jiffies conversion helper functions
2/4: core human-time modifications to soft-timer subsystem
3/4: add new human-time schedule_timeout() functions
4/4: rework sys_nanosleep() to use schedule_timeout_nsecs()
The individual patches have more details, but the gist is this:
We no longer use jiffies (the variable) as the basis for determining
what "time" a timer should expire or when it should be added. Instead,
we use a new function, do_monotonic_clock(), which is simply a wrapper
for getnstimeofday(). That is to say, we use uptime in nanoseconds. But,
to avoid modifying the existing soft-timer algorithm, we convert the
64-bit nanosecond value to "timerinterval" units. These units are simply
2^TIMEINTERVAL_BITS nanoseconds in length (thus determined at compile
time).
To sum up, soft-timers now use time (as defined by the
timeofday-subsystem) not ticks. Hopefully, the individual
e-mails/patches make this change clear.
Thanks,
Nish
