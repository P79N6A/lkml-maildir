There's always a namespace string and an attribute name string?  That sounds
like two parameters to me, why are they being passed as one.

I'm did not miss that.  Why do you want glibc, or worse, user tools, doing
extra ascii smashing to build up the ea string in the format the kernel
interface wants.

Namespaces are good.  I don't like the syntax being built into the name.
This is every bit as wrong as the thing Al complained about, creating more
system calls by passing in a function number.
If there are two strings, pass two strings.
