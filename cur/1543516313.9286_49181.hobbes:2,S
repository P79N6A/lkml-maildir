Hi Ingo,
I ran into an OOM problem while testing.  Having heard someone mention
ramdisk troubles, I enabled it and booted with ramdisk_size=16384. Made
an fs (mke2fs /dev/ram0) mounted it and ran Bonnie -s 12 a few times.
Result was terminal OOM.  Everything else seems to work fine, so this
may just be a driver bug(?).  I can't revert my tree just yet to find
out for sure.
Memleak results with line numbers translated to zoned-2.3.28-K2 stock.
