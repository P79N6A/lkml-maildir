KBUILD_DEFCONFIG is supposed to point out a file located in
arch/$(ARCH)/configs.
I assume you copy the file to that directory.
Browsing the changes to scripts/kconfig/Makefile
nothing says 'this is the bug' but I suggest you to look there
first of all. 
I do not have -git2 and -git3 handy to do a diff between.
