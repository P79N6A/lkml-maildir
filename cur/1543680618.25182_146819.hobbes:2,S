Subject: IDE/Promise 20276 FastTrack RAID Doesn't work in 2.4.21, patch attached to fix

Folks,
After I upgraded to 2.4.21, I noticed my Gigabyte motherboard with 
onboard IDE Promise 20276 FastTrack RAID no longer works.  The following 
patch fixes the problem, which appears to be an incomplete list of 
devices in the ide setup code.  There are probably other fasttrack RAID 
adaptors that should be added to the setup code, but I don't know what 
they are.
Thanks
