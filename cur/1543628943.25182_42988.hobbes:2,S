It fits and works on a 4MB machine with no problems, my 831K-compressed bzip2
-9 kernel works on a 4MB box, ... *if* I'm not also loading a 4MB ramdisk ...
Specifically, the window allocated in misc.c is 32K, bzip2 using 'small'
varies between 350K for a -1 compressed file and 2350K for a -9 compressed
file.  (My previously posted compression numbers are for -9.)
The decompress time for bzip2 -d -s is about 14 times slower than gzip.
If you are booting a 386 from striped U2W arrays, it would for sure be
'noticably slower'.  If, however, as is more common with tomsrtbt, you are
booting for the purpose of rescue and recovery, from a grinding floppy drive,
it is probably never slower enough to matter, even on a 486.  I certainly
only consider it appropriate for situations where this trade off makes sense.
Floppies and flash memory come to mind, but not hard drives.
