it doesn't work.
configuration: SMP, ac'97, IRQ gets assigned to 18.
problem: interrupts appear to not be firing. Neither PRINTK() in
via_intr_channel() or via_interrupt() ever get called (suggesting that
the interrupt is either not firing, or not connected to the service routine).
I've enabled debug, and have more information in the logs, but the short answer
is "the interrupts aren't firing".
in single processor more, no problem. (but that was always the case).
