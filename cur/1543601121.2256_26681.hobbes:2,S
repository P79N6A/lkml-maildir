Hello...
I (and someone else) had also mysterious problems with AIC7xxx and
RAID1/5, but we use Kernel 2.4.x.
In Kernel 2.4.x you can choose between two versions of the
aix7xxx-driver, one "old" one (Version 5.2.x) and a "new" one (Version
6.x.x). Do a "cat /proc/scsi/aic7xxx/0" to find your version.
We both found out that our problems dissapear when we use the "old"
driver (my tests are still in progress because my error (always the same
scsi-disk falling out of an raid5-array with an "internal error", but
the disk seems to be good) only appeared randomly about once a week, so
i still have to wait if it is really gone.
So perhaps you can try to use the older driver or determine the version
of your aic7xxx-driver. Perhaps you can use the aic7xxx-driver from
kernel 2.2.18 in Kernel 2.2.19 ?
You should also boot your system with the parameter "aic7xxx=verbose",
that will provide more infos in the syslog.
Solong..
Frank.

Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
