  Actually I've just checked the code and MS_ACTIVE is almost unused -
the only place where it is checked is generic_forget_inode(). So
Andrew's suggestion should be safe (and a quick grep showed that quite
a few filesystems already set MS_ACTIVE in their code)... What really
protects the filesystem from early operations is the fact that its
directory tree is made visible to the rest of the world in
do_add_mount() which is quite after fill_super() has finished.
