Ah, got it. I guess you meant __ARCH_WANT_UNLOCKED_CTXSW though.
In that case schedule() drops rq->lock before the context switch, but doesn't
clear ->oncpu. So, task_running(p) means we must not activate "p" on another
CPU, otherwise it could be scheduled before the switch-in-progress completes.
Thanks a lot!
