Dear Kernel Maintainers,
I am with Phil Oester and Andrew Morton when it comes to getting 
kgdb into the mainline kernel.  I _am_ a full time developer, and 
when I have to work with Linux kernel code, kgdb makes things a lot 
easier.  I work on many different platforms, with many different 
operating systems, and there just is not enough time in the day to 
learn every line of every version of the kernel.  kgdb allows me to 
get in, see what I need, and get out.
That being said, if kgdb _does_ become mainline, and people are able 
to get more visibility into how the kernel works in real time, you 
will probably see more exploits.  This may be the secret reason for 
reluctance by the powers on high.
CC me if you want me to see your reply as I am not on the list.
