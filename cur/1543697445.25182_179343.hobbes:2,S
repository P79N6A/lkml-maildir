I applied it manually to 2.6.0-test9-mm4 (because there is some offset
that prevents the patch to apply cleanly to it).
Compiled the kernel with the exact same configuration used in previous
tests, as well as modules. Booted with this new kernel
(2.6.0-test9-mm4-fix) and reconfigured (vmware-config.pl) VMware.
Otherwise, everything is as it was yesterday. Booted the program,
started the same guest operating system as ever, and now the BUG is gone
and everything works OK.
Great work, greetings.
