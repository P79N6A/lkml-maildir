The problem is happening in 2.4 too so I believe preemption is not the
culprit. Here are some details:

(Daniel wrote the patch which got applied to 2.4, it fixed the problems
for him).
There are several other reports of "no DRQ after issuing {MULTI}WRITE",
some of them probably involved with this bug, some of them potentially
not. You can find more reports (both from 2.6 and 2.4) at:

From my fast code read, there is no other locking involved.
It sounds you are right, the timeout is too small --- we need confirmation
from the people who can hit it that increasing it fixes the problem.
