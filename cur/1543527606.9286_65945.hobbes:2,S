     Hi,
   I'm using the 2.3.47 kernel with succes since I've compiled it, but this
night I've noticed this message in the console and in the logs:
Feb 27 00:04:50 coruscant kernel: __elevator_merge: req latency 46 req latency 32
  I've seen lately some threads about 'elevator' but I really have no idea
about what is an elevator in this context, and so, I haven't read these
threads.
   So I'm wondering:
     Is this hurt?
     Is this a known bug?
     Could I help tracking it?
          Regards,
                      DindinX
