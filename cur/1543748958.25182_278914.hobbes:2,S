I think that argument is valid only when satisfying the static tool
is especially cumbersome or inefficient, requires ugly code, etc.
In most cases a trivial rewrite will suffice, and the result is cleaner
code, easier to maintain, fewer bugs.
You say "but today nothing is wrong". But the longer the reasoning is,
the easier one of the steps in the argument will be broken by some
trivial change. By someone who did not know about all the invariants
required by a certain piece of code.
Look

26 megabytes of changes. In a hundred trivial changes there is at least
one flaw. These 26 megabytes will again introduce lots of minor problems.
The more of these can be found automatically, by static analysis, the
more time is left for debugging serious stuff.

I checked, and indeed, no warnings for this patch.
But that is the only thing I checked. I would never submit it.
Probably you should send it to davem and see whether he likes it.
