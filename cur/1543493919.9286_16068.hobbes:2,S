No, Linux itself is not vulnerable; at least there is no known
vulnerability.

This would require root access.  If somebody has root access, a trojan 
is probably the least of your worries.

While this would, of course, be the ultimate in security, the
complexity and frequency of updates of today's server software means
that this is not practical for most of us.  Thus, we rely on PGP/GPG
signatures from the authors, on the same from our software
distributors, and the like in lieu of being able to review millions of 
lines of code ourselves.

And of course now that this is published, somebody will be smart and
go in wit 946702801 and mess up the greps.

Certainly we must look out for Y2K issues wherever possible, but I
think that calling for everyone to review all code to programs running 
on their machine solely because of this issue is response not in
proportion to the danger.

Hmm.  Trade in your 686 for an Alpha then :-)
