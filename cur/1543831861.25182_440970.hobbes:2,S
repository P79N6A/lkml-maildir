But with timestamps I need remember only one number, the time of my last 
backup. Skipping over the question of "who's idea of time" inherent in 
network filesystems. I compare all ctimes with the time of the last 
backup and do incremental on the newer ones. If we use versioning I have 
to remember the version for each file! In practice I really question if 
the benefit justified keeping all that metadata between backups. And if 
I delete a file and create another by the same name, what is it's version?
I'll say it again, I think ms resolution is readily achieved today, even 
over network files, I think greater resolution or versions are going to 
be more trouble than they are worth.

No comment, I would have to see a state table to be sure I saw the races 
or that there were none. With a single writer and a sinple dirty bit 
there is no issue, it behaves like an elevator, more or less. With 
multiple writers I bet changes are written in the order submitted rather 
than the order done, but multiple writers without locks are a train 
wreck waiting to happen anyway.
