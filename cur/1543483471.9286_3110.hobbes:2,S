Kidding Alan, but I have never had the honor of speaking to
such an esteemed, venerable member of the Linux brain trust
in my entire life! :-)
But thanks for the pointer to 'hang in there' ... besides,
I'm not yet a programmer/hacker (though I'm turning 39 this
May 17) but the ES1688 sound problem got me and a few members
of ELUG to take 'kernel observation' a little more seriously
(in a good way ;-)
Cheers,
Jeff
