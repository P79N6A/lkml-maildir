Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Debug handling of early spurious interrupts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/19/687

With the advent of kdump it is possible that device drivers receive
interrupts generated in the context of a previous kernel. Ideally
quiescing the underlying devices should suffice but not all drivers do
this, either because it is not possible or because they did not
contemplate this case. Thus drivers ought to be able to handle
interrupts coming in as soon as the interrupt handler is registered.
