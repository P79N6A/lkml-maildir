Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.19-pre3 - readv/writev should return EINVAL for count=0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This is a minor patch against 2.4.19-pre3 for readv/writev to have it
return EINVAL if count=0 is passed to it.  According to the man page and
also the specifications for readv/writev, this is the correct behaviour.
Thanks,
Paul Larson
