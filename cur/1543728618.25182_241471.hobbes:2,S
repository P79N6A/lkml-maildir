Ugh ? What do you mean ? The suspend kernel will snapshot the kernel
memory at one point, after the device suspend call has been done. If
the device relies on some changes done after that, then it's broken
somewhat.
The resume will restore all memory, not MMIO of course, and it's up
to the driver to do whatever is necessary to restore operations
properly.

Yes.
The problem is the same with suspend-to-RAM basically.
