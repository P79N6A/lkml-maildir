ISDN4Linux provides a fake modem emulation in kernel space. The Nokia
phone drivers provide a user space manager which provides the interface.
So you've got precedents for both. If it's simply a case of splitting AT
commands off from the data and spotting guard bands and +++ you might
want to do it kernel side, if the second endpoint takes its own set of
phone control messages I guess its hairier.
