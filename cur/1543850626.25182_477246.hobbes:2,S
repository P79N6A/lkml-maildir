I agree that it may be confusing. The whole point in using __get_user()
is that it ensures that the source address is valid.
When handle_BUG() is called the kernel is no more in a "sane" state,
blindly using the content of the registers may lead to a page fault in
kernel mode. So the code extract filename and line of the BUG checking
that the line number is indeed readable, the address of the string (file
name) is readable and it points to a readable memory location.
probe_kernel_address wrapper is used to "hide" the fact that we are
re-using the infrastructure provided by a function with a confusing name
;) The cast to __user is needed to keep sparse quiet.

No, __user annotation ensure that sparse will notice things like:
int random_pointer_from_userspace __user *data;
...
my_data = *data; /* <-- sparse will complain */
In this scenario 'data' is a pointer provided by userspace application
and *cannot* be trusted; it shall be used only with functions that do
check the address before using it, like __get_user(). (get_user() also
checks that the address is a *userspace* address, it can't be used to
read kernel memory).
