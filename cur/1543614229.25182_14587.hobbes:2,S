Hi,
	I have the following problem since 2.4.17 on my laptop with a PC-Card
network card. When something is sent over the network the kernel prints
"kernel: svc: bad direction 65537, dropping request"
into the syslog and the network stops working. It does start to work again 
after some time. This happenes without any scheme, but frequently when trying 
to access NFS mounts.

	What is this message about and what triggers it? I found some 
occurences of this in the lkml archive. Like 
http://lists.kernelnotes.de/linux-kernel/Week-of-Mon-20011008/044888.html
 but 
this does not apply to this.
	I became aware of this problem with 2.4.17, however there is also a 
syslog entry with the very same message when the system was running 2.4.16. 
But with .17 I get the error quite frequently and the network stops working.
	The network card running in the system (if the driver might be the 
problem) is identified as

	I would be glad for any hints. If you need more details about the 
system I'll provide it. Um... help? :)
