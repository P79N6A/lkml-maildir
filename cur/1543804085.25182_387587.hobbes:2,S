Why?
The real downside is that "atomic_inc_nonzero()" is a lot more expensive 
than checking for zero on x86 (and x86-64).
The reason it's offset is that on architectures that automatically test 
the _result_ of an atomic op (ie x86[-64]), it's easy to see when 
something _becomes_ negative or _becomes_ zero, and that's what
	atomic_add_negative
	atomic_inc_and_test
are optimized for (there's also "atomic_dec_and_test()" which reacts on 
the count becoming zero, but that doesn't have a pairing: there's no way 
to react to the count becoming one for the increment operation, so the 
"atomic_dec_and_test()" is used for things where zero means "free it").
Nothing else can be done that fast on x86. Everything else requires an 
insane "load, update, cmpxchg" sequence.
So I disagree with this patch series. It has real downsides. There's a 
reason we have the offset.
I suspect that whatever "nice optimizations" you have are quite doable 
without doing this count pessimization.
