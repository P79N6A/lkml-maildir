I explained them very clear in my original post:

I appreciate your responsibility, but the is_continous field was
introduced on my request because I did not want to rely on (rating > X)
to decide whether I can safely switch to high resolution timer mode or

I really do not understand, why you claim to be the ultimate authority
to decide whats right and wrong in this area. Can you please shed some
light on my agnostic mind with some _real_ explanation why you can claim
to have the authority to decide whats needed and whats not needed ?

Right. Even if no user cares about this right now, nevertheless
forseeing the requirements of the near future is the finer art of
engineering. Especially if there is existing experience, which shows
that it is necessary.
