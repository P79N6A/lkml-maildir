The other infrastructure is for asynchronous reporting and recovery. We
still need synchronous detection & reporting. So this is a bit
different.
However, it would be nice if Hidetoshi's work could be adapted a bit so
that 1) naming is a bit more consistent with the other stuff (pcierr_*
maybe) and 2) the error "token" is the same. The later is especially
important if we start adding ways to query the error token to know what
the error precisely was etc... There is no reason to have 2 different
ways of representing error details.
