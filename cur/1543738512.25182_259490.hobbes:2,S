.. take a look at PM_SUSPEND_DISK for a moment.
If you only care about PM_SUSPEND_MEM, then what's your problem? You get 
the right value already. 
And if you _do_ care about PM_SUSPEND_DISK, then don't ignore it in the
discussion. You can't have it both ways.
The fact is, my laptop can now (finally) do suspend-to-disk. It never 
could do that before. And yes, it does use radeonfb, so your arguments 
hold no water with me. 
I told you what can done to fix things up. Stop ignoring that reality.
