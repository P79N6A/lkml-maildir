Actually it is implemented in the aic7xxx driver, see ahc_suspend and
ahc_resume.
I tried it with 2.6.12, and I no longer have the problem with the ahc_dv
thread as it no longer exists (AFAICT the functionality is handled by
the SCSI midlayer now?).
Now it just immediately resumes:
[4297399.286000] PM: Preparing system for standby sleep
[4297399.609000] Stopping tasks: ================================|
[4297399.610000] Restarting tasks... done
How can I debug this further?
