You want to see combination of mc and podfuk. We already do file
transport over ssh. Yes, with podfuk it acts like
userfs.

 [We
do not actually use scp; ssh is just enough: we upload "programs" to
the server, dd is required on remote side. Look at mc/vfs/fish.c.]

PS: userfs is dead. Podfuk is trying to be replacement. Improving
midnight is the right way.
