Just tried 2.4.4 yesterday and found that my eth1 was dead after 5 minutes.
The log says:
Apr 30 10:30:59 fluke kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out 
Apr 30 10:30:59 fluke kernel: eth1: Transmit timed out, status fc664010, CSR12 00000000, resetting... 
Apr 30 10:31:07 fluke kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out 
Apr 30 10:31:07 fluke kernel: eth1: Transmit timed out, status fc664010, CSR12 00000000, resetting...  
... and so on repeatedly ...
I had to ifdown-ifup cycle to re-enable it but it's dead again after 5
minutes with the same problem. The card is LinkSys LNE100TX v4.1. It is
currently working fine with 2.2.18. If there's any other info that is needed
please let me know.
