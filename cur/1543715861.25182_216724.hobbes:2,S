Rusty, the workaround was done a while ago, back in the 2.5 days when 
your new module code
was still very much in flux. It was necessary to have an effective 
short-term solution for the existing
installed base (2.4), since we could not continue to confuse customers 
while waiting for the patch
to propagate. In other cases, we have gladly submitted patches when we 
encountered bugs and
could fix them. Had we known that the module fix was so simple, it 
would of course have been
submitted it to you in parallel.
Also since you and I have worked well together in other projects 
(netfilter core) and are long time friends,
I don't understand why you are so quick to question my integrity in 
public. We didn't lie about anything;
the license text is perfectly clear, and the political situation with 
Conexant's proprietary signal processing
code outside of our control.
