Hi,
Today I updated the BIOS of my motherboard, a ABIT KT7A (VIA Apollo KT133A
chipset). The kernel I had (2.4.9) started crashing on boot with an
invalid page fault, usually right after starting init. I tryed a i686
kernel and noticed it works OK, so I recompiled my crashy kernel only
switching the processor type and it also worked. changed it back to
Athlon/K7/Duron and it starts crashing.
Anyone else experiencing this?
TIA,
