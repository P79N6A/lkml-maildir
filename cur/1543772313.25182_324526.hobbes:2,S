I have changed my mind having had a look at the code some more.  Patch B
is definitely needed.
Otherwise you can get a situation where an allocating write followed by
an erring write to the same location would cause uptodate and already
written out buffers to be zeroed & written out thus overwritting
existing data with zero.
This could be worked around differently (e.g. by being more picky which
buffer_new buffers get zeroed&written in the error handling) it is
definitely safest to just apply patch B.
Best regards,
