Hmmm, then I cannot get the ec access log for hang case?!
	acpi_hw_low_level_read(8, data, &ec->common.data_addr);
	ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT((ACPI_DB_INFO, "Read [%02x] from address
[%02x]\n",
			  *data, address));
Does it mean we need to slow down  acpi_ec_intr_read/write ?
Could you try to insert acpi_os_stall (100)  after  ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT
statement
both in acpi_ec_intr_read/write.
