This would be great!
I'm currently fussing about how my new RAID driver
(hardware assisted) can expose it's member drives
in such a way as for the userspace RAID management s/w
to be able to find them.
The driver only sees channel:device:lun, whereas in userspace
there's no tidy way to convert that to a major:minor pair.
I figure this cannot be the only situation where this is a problem.
We're hoping to resolve it all with the scsidev utility,
which is basically a kludge to work around a very inconventient
API from the kernel.  Having a /dev/cam interface as described above
would certainly help here.
What other ways to do this should I be looking at?
(common to both 2.4.xx and 2.6.xx ??)
