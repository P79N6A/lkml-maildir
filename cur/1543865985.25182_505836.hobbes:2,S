It seems to me that kevent was designed to handle many events sources on a 
single endpoint, like epoll (but with different internals). Typical load of 
thousand of sockets/pipes providers glued into one queue.
In the fibril case, I guess a thread wont have many fibrils lying around...
Also, kevent needs a fd lookup/fput to retrieve some queued events, and that 
may be a performance hit for the AIO case, (fget/fput in a multi-threaded 
program cost some atomic ops)
