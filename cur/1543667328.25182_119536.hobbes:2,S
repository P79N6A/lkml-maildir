not from this debugging source - USB wireless keyboard :) - however, ~1000
printks later I've found out the following: the kernel spins in the while()
loop in drivers/ide/ide_register_driver:
	while (!list_empty(&list)) {
		ide_drive_t *drive = list_entry(list.next, ide_drive_t,
list);
		list_del_init(&drive->list);
		if (drive->present)
			ata_attach(drive);
	}
It was called by ide_register_driver, which itself got called by
idedisk_init.
