Okay. I still don't know what's wrong. The following code
shows that your MACRO does produce the right stuff:

Ignoring the "multiple-defined" warnings, one can see that the
divisor and the stuff that will be put into the registers is
correct. Sorry to bother you.
It looks like this problem has to be fixed with a hammer. For some
reason, the chip doesn't like the new values.
I'm off by about 7 seconds per minute:

It gains time, meaning that the divisor is too small. Unfortunately,
I can't read what was written to the actual chip. I can only detect
its affect. 60 / 67 = 0.89 * 100 = 89. 1188200/89 = 13350 = 0x3426
as a divisor. It doesn't make sense because both LSB and MSB are
wrong. If one was wrong I could guess that the previous hadn't set
up properly and needs more delay.
Anyway. I will continue to search.
