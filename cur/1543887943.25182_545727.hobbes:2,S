Just for reference:

Sorry, I thought Rusty meant that we can use it if we invent our own
type, see the first part of his answer. You did not answer Frank's mail
about _why_ we use it. So I thought you agreed with us, I did not ignore
you, no need to be so assertive.
It is not a problem to fix this, but neither Rusty nor you explained
what is wrong with that call. But we _did_ explain why we use it. You
ignored the explanation and the questions.
