I haven't gotten a reply to this question, but I've done my own research, and I think I 
found the answer.  Using my own test of get_user_pages(), it appears that the fix was 
placed in 2.6.7.  However, I would like to know specifically what the fix is. 
Unfortunately, tracking this stuff down is beyond my understanding of the Linux VM.
Assuming that the fix is in try_to_unmap_one(), the only significant change I see between
2.6.6 and 2.6.7 is the addition of this code:
	pgd = pgd_offset(mm, address);
	if (!pgd_present(*pgd))
		goto out_unlock;
	pmd = pmd_offset(pgd, address);
	if (!pmd_present(*pmd))
		goto out_unlock;
	pte = pte_offset_map(pmd, address);
	if (!pte_present(*pte))
		goto out_unmap;
	if (page_to_pfn(page) != pte_pfn(*pte))
		goto out_unmap;
Can anyone tell me if this is the actual fix, or at least a major part of the actual fix?
