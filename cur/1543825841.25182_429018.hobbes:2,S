Ok, I decided to rerun a simple random read work load (with fio), using
depths 1 and 32. The test is simple - it does random reads all over the
drive size with 4kb block sizes. The reads are O_DIRECT. The test
pattern was set to repeatable, so it's going through the same workload.
The test spans the first 32G of the drive and runtime is capped at 20
seconds.
Now of course this is truly an artificial work load, however it's still
interesting from the POV of what NCQ can potentially do for you. If you
want something specific run, let me know and I can quickly do so (eg
write through cache random writes).
