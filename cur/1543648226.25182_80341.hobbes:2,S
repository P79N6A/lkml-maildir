   +               return (u32)dentry;
   Um, isn't this supposed to uniquely identify the dentry?
   On a platform with 64-bit pointers there's now the theoretical
   possibility of different dentries getting the same cookie ...
That's true.
We dealt with this (trying to use a kernel pointer as a cache held by
userspace) in tcp_diag by making the actual object opaque.  It was
actually two u32's, and that way it worked independant of kernel
vs. user word size.
