Sorry to double post.  The machine that is down processes most of my
email.  However,
this account works.
A machine froze after 30 days uptime.  After reboot, it fell out of
fsck with an unrecoverable
error.
I ran fsck -C -y /dev/md1.  At 73% it starting reporting
Unattached inode 250143
Connect to /lost+found? yes
Inode 1815609 ref count is 2, should be 1. Fix? yes
It has gone from 250143 to 1815610  doing this over the last 36 hours.
And so far as I know will do on doing this forever?
Linux 2.4.25 untainted. ext2 filesystem (no journaling).
Any advice on how I should proceed?
