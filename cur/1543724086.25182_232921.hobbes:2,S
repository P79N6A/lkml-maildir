Could you please elaborate the rules of English in which "An integer
constant expresion with the value 0 [...] is called a null pointer
constant" does not mean that 0 is a null pointer?  0 is certainly an
integer constant expression with the value 0, so there must be
something extraordinarily subtle in the second half of the sentence.
