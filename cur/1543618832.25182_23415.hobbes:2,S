You may try /sbin/setpci -v -s 00:0e.0 0D.B=40
Check 
http://www.networking.tzo.com/net/software/readme/faqvl019.htm
and 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0112.3/0922.html
The first one is a patch for Windows to correct the problem, it is
called "VIA latency patch" since it used to only modify latency. It is
closed source so it is difficult to see if the correction towards the
sound card is about latency (so my command line is useless).
The second one is a post from the author of the corresponding VIA
latency patch under Linux, you may want to try it (and to tweak it if
you don't have a KT266A).
However, the problem seems not IRQ related, so you may want to try
another slots for your sound card.
