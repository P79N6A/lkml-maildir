Both kdb and lkcd use cross cpu NMI for debugging and dumping on SMP.
That plus oprofile and the NMI watchdog makes at least four users of
NMI.  A one level hook is not going to cut it, it should be a list.
I admit that removal of a hook from the NMI list while still handling
NMI interrupts is "interesting", but that is a SMOP ;).  RCU to the
rescue?
