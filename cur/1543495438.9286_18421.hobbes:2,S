Hello,
I have a real problem with Linux-2.2.5: For some reason that is not 
hardware, init dies. This wouldn't be as bad if
1) A message would go to syslog (and not to console only)
2) The kernel would really panic
3) The kernel would not silently fille the process table and refuse   
   to start any more processes.
As you know, if your system is in that state, you can switch 
consoles, find nothing unusual, but you can't login, you can't 
shutdown, and you can't even TELNET into the machine.
With my most recent crash I just exited "man rpm" when no prompt came 
again, and I could not enter any command!
I thin something should be done. (I don't know the problem that 
causes the crash, but I suspect a late consequence form some failed 
SCSI (AHA1542) tape access using dump. (dump does nothing when it is 
expected to write to the tape; I interrupted the process after a few 
minutes))
Sorry for the bad news,
Ulrich
