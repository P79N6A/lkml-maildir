The linking error happens because you have 
CONFIG_SOUND_TRIDENT=y
and 
CONFIG_INPUT_PCIGAME=m 
trident.c will call pcigame_attach(), which is either defined or a
nop, depending on whether CONFIG_INPUT_PCIGAME is defined or not. In
your .config it's defined, but as a module. So the call to
pcigame_attach() is trident is defined. But trident is built in, so
when the linker tries to link everything together, it fails because it
cannot find the code for pcigame_attach. It can't find it, since it's
compiled as a module, and thus not linked into the bzImage. 
As a quick fix, you can either make trident a module, or make pcigame
built in, or remove pcigame, if you don't have a joystick
attached. This fairly ugly untested patch against 2.4.21-rc2 should
enforce the dependencies between trident and pcigame.
