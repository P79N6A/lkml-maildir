If you are not sure - RTFSource or shut up.

	And I should give a flying damn for any (end-)luser. Why? Please,
try to realize that problems with binary incompatibility in modules are
much more serious than any end-lusers' delusions. End-luser has no f*cking
business to upgrade/rebuild anything. It's not simple on any OS. Leave it
to admin.

Oh, horror! They told on SlashDot that there is a k3w1 n3w r3133z and
3133t d00d burned his sorry ass. Luser dies, we die, grass turns
purple and also dies, sun turns into the black hole and sucks the whole
Galaxy in. Everyone die. Oh, embarrasment!
	Seriously, WTF are you talking about? All this stuff about separate
tarballs was around splitting a single tree into parts and letting people
to download what they need. WTF does it have to module interface changes
and/or somebody downloading parts of different releases, compiling them to
Frankenstein monster and frying its ass?

	You used to be a Komsomol activist, didn't you? You know, there is
some difference between l-k and meeting.
