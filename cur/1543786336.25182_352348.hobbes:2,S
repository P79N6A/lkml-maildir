It's not absolutely required for crash -- but more of a convenience.  As it is, the
set of NT_PRSTATUS sections can be scoured for the set of active
tasks, and then the process stacks (and potentially the IRQ stacks, then
mapped back to the proper process stack) can be searched for crash_kexec.
So crash works without the task_struct pointer, but it's ugly.  It's just that
netdump, diskdump and LKCD all report the panic task_struct pointer,
and it seems a reasonable thing to do.

The page size is needed for a whole host of things, primarily for
virtual-to-physical address translations, a bunch of VM-related
commands, etc.  For non-x86[_64] systems. the host system may
be using a different page size than the vmcore being examining.
That's probably a rare situation, and using getpagesize() on the
host would work in most cases, or perhaps issuing the page size
as a command line option, but again, it's another convenience item
that gets reported by netdump, diskdump and LKCD.

They can be found in the per-cpu runqueues data structure.

I guess that's their whole point.  This NT_KDUMPINFO or whatever
you want to call it, could cumulatively collect any other data deemed
necessary that falls outside the bounds of the existing note types.
