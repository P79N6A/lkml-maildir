So we need to dive a bit deeper to understand why everything gets
rebuild.
Try following patch:
diff --git a/scripts/Makefile.build b/scripts/Makefile.build
index e48e60d..4c52131 100644
--- a/scripts/Makefile.build
+++ b/scripts/Makefile.build
@@ -189,6 +189,9 @@ endef
 # Built-in and composite module parts
 
 %.o: %.c FORCE
+	@echo $@
+	@echo chg=$?
+	@echo arg-check=$(call arg-check, $(cmd_cc_o_c), $(cmd_$@))
 	$(call cmd,force_checksrc)
 	$(call if_changed_rule,cc_o_c)
 
This will not fix anything - but will give us a hint why things gets
rebuild.
After applying the patch try:
make init/do_mounts.o
And then post the output.
Also include the .do_mounts.o.cmd file
