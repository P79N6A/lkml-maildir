Hi Vincent;
I happen to have XFree86 Version 4.0.2 installed.    What I was hoping to
do was to avoid an upgrade of the Windowing system, mostly because it has
been working well.    To avoid an upgrade of X, I did not enable DRI in the
kernel.   I thought that this along with a editing the XF86Config file
would have been enough to get the driver to work correctly.
Obviously this has not been the case.   It would be unfortunate if I had to
upgrade X just to get the kernel (2.4.10) to work.   Right now I'm going to
see if I can find a set of upgrade RPMS for X.   For a RedHat 6.2 this may
take a bit of work.
Dave
