Well, I don't have any objections, per se. What I did notice immediately
though is that the web browser is still involved. My *ideal*
implementation would be very similar. The only significant difference
would be that the patches would be sorted into directories, in a public
ftp archive. The special comments would be display while changing
directories in the archive. This way I can at least just type 'lynx
ftp://kernel.patches.archive/patch_name/
' and the first entry is the most
current patch, and the special comments from the author would be displayed
at the top.
