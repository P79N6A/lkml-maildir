Yeah, that looks like the right sort of thing, but I wonder if there's
other places doing an open-coded "pte_val(pte) & ~_PAGE_FOO".  My patch
changes the definition of _PAGE_FOO so it should be OK everywhere.

and below is the fix against full x86.git#mm.

Subject: x86/pgtable: fix constant sign extension problem
From: Jeremy Fitzhardinge <jeremy@goop.org>
When the _PAGE_FOO constants are defined as (1ul << _PAGE_BIT_FOO), they
become unsigned longs.  In 32-bit PAE mode, these end up being
implicitly cast to 64-bit types when used to manipulate a pte, and
because they're unsigned the top 32-bits are 0, destroying the upper
bits of the pte.
When _PAGE_FOO constants are given a signed integer type, the cast to
64-bits will sign-extend so that the upper bits are all ones,
preserving the upper pte bits in manipulations.
