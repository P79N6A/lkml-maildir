	He said if you just translate the symbols...  He really sort of
meant translate the digits (Roman Numeral Digits).
	i.e...
	IV     => I   V
	I   V  => 1   5
	1   5  => 15.
	When I was at Michigan State University, we had something similar.
The mainframe there was a CDC 6500, a 6000 series system, and the programing
group called themselves the VIM group for "6000 series".  That was
VIM => VI M => 6 1000 => 6000.

	No it's not the correct way, but that's not the point, is it.

	No.  They didn't screw up.  They just tried a Roman Numeral pun.
