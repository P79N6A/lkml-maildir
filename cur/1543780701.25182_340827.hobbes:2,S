The majority of pages I am seeing no longer have page->mapping set. Does
this mean they are in the process of being cleared up?

Nothing at all, which explains why I occasionally got oops when I was
trying to free pages with the mapping set. I am going to follow your
suggestions and see how I get on.
If it is still not working out, I will try reclaiming when the workload is
something other than a large number of kernel compiles to see if I am on
the right track at all.
Thanks a lot
