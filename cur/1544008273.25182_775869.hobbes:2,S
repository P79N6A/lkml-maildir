Which dma driver are you using?  The dmaengine code assumes that all
channels on a device are equal.  It sounds like there are differences
between peer-channels on the device in this case.  If the driver
registers a device per channel that should give the flexibility you
want.

hmm... can the framebuffer be moved to late_initcall?
