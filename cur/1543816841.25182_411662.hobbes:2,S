That's the trouble. While I have nothing against someone (as in -- not me :) 
doing all that abi separation, it's not something I can use straight away. 
Hell, I don't even get where in all of it I'd end up with something I could 
use (granted, I haven't looked into the thread too closely). Not to mention, 
that I suspect, that if there were enough people to do it, it would have 
gotten done two years ago.
So unless anybody's got a better idea, I'll try releasing some initial version 
of that llh-ng thingie rather soonish and see how that'll work out. Anybody 
with me on that? :)
