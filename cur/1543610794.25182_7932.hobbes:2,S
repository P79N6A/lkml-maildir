No. Just the -pre-final is a -pre-final. :) 
-pre-final basically means that this is the "candidate" release for the
final.
I could call it "candidate" or whatever (I don't really care about the
name).

If people don't like the -pre-final name, I can call it "-candidate" as I
said previously.

Thats exactly the idea with the "pre-final" thingie.
