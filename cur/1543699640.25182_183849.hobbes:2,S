Actually, the way I rewrote it in the patch is immune to that kind of
problem:
seq_printf(m, "\nbogomips\t: %lu.%02lu\n\n",
           HZ*(c->loops_per_jiffy>>3)/62500,
           (HZ*(c->loops_per_jiffy>>3)/625)%100);
It will work correctly for any HZ up to ~34000 bogomips (using 32-bit
arithmetic).
