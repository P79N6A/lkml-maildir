you can destroy them at will from user-space too - just start a slow 
timer that zaps them if load goes down. I can add a 
sys_async_thread_exit(nr_threads) API to be able to drive this without 
knowing the TIDs of those threads, and/or i can add a kernel-internal 
mechanism to zap inactive threads. It would be rather easy and 
low-overhead - the v2 code already had a max_nr_threads tunable, i can 
reintroduce it. So the size of the pool of contexts does not have to be 
permanent at all.
