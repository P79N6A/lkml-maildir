Indeed. Another thing that should not be forgotten: it could be that the
whole kernel text segment resides in a shared read only segment. So it can
be shared by multiple z/VM guests.
In that case the cs instruction will fail. Looks like you need to write the
part that replaces the instruction in assembly and supply a fixup section
which in turn makes sure that -EFAULT is returned.
