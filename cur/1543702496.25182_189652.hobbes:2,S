I have the same problem in 2.6.1: Infrequently the mouse(rather: the 
trackpoint) jumps around and clicks wildly on the desktop.... Extremely 
annoying. The log message is identical. I do not think it is dependent on 
load. It only happens when I USE the pointer though...
I am using Debian/unstable, X-4.3, linux-2.6.1 with alsa and the DSDT-initrd 
patch on my IBM Thinkpad R31 Mobile Celeron 1,2 GHz. 
Bye, Moritz Moeller-Herrmann
