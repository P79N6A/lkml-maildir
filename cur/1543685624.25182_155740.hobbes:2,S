I have been testing this jewel on top of 2.6.0-test2-mm5 for a couple of
hours. It behaves much like O13*int, well maybe a little bit better:
Renicing X to -20 is a total disaster (sluggish window movement, Juk
skipping like mad, etc), but with X at +0 the system feels pretty good.
Evolution still feels like a mamooth when moving windows over it. XMMS
doesn't skip, neither Juk does when X is at +0. This is good :-)
All in all, this one feels good!
PS: May I say O10int is still a little bit smoother than this one? ;-)
