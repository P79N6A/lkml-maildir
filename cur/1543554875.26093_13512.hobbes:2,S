   Oh, you mean  IEEE 802.1q VLAN trunking protocol ?

   The baseline Linux is not, but there has been external development
   activity to create patches supporting vlan-trunk interfacing.
   In fact TWO separate patches, which now do share some code:
	
http://scry.wanfear.com/~greear/vlan.html
	
http://vlan.sourceforge.net/
   I have seen VLAN trunking implemented at some network cards for
   Solaris (gigabit cards mainly), similar is propably true for
   the windows world.    Common thing there is that the DRIVER creates
   an illusion of having gazillions of network devices, each plain
   simple ethernet device.
   Linux is slightly different from that model by having generalized
   802.1q frame PROTOCOL processing layer which isn't bound to any
   particular network device driver.  For upper protocols also Linux
   VLAN code supplies an illusion of ethernet device per each VLAN
   sub-interface.
   Linux is slowly getting its network drivers capable to support 802.1q
   enlarged ethernet frames, but those are still few and far in between.
