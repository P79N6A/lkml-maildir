Seems to me few other people think that way, thats why it is so
har for them to get.  And thats why this style of coding isn't very
helpful either.  It may be a real help for you, but not for others
who merely get confused or irritated at the small but easy to eliminate
micro-bloat.
There are certainly people so used to the implicit zeroing that they
think of "static int a;" as a zero initialization as explicit as
anything, because that's the way the language works. And they will
take just as much care if the "a-using" code is modified to run twice.
The "=0" part don't make it clearer for them if it was clear already.
