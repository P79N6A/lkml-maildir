 A deadlock occured today on our test machine, and the offending part
was drivers/char/random.c:iplock.  The spinlock is used without _bh
suffix both by the connect and accept paths causing deadlock
occasionally.  This seemed to be already fixed in the latest 2.4 bk
tree.  I believe this will cure our problem. :-)
