Could you elaborate on what you mean here?
If you mean instead of hanging a pci_sysdata off of struct pci_bus,
hang a 'void *iommu' and an 'int node' directly off of the pci_bus,
that looks like a lot of churn (most architecture use sysdata as an
opaque pointer to an arch specific structure) and bloat (you would
need to hang off pci_bus everything that is in every arch's use of
sysdata!) for very little type safety.
