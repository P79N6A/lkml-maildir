There is another approach save for the one already discussed here, which
I have no idea how applicable it is in your case, but will produce 100%
reliable results without additional kernel support - track the processes
forks.
There are several ways you can go about it - there's the expensive (in
terms of CPU cycles) approach of using ptrace(2), the relativly painless
way of overriding the "default" calls to fork and friends via ld.so(8)
magical LD_PRELOAD  that nevertheless requires you control the execution
of the "client" programs and even using a system call tracking module
such as syscall-tracker (
http://syscalltrack.sf.net
) which might not be
quite ready for use on a production system as of yet.
Hope this helps,
Gilad
