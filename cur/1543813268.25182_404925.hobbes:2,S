+===========================
+WHAT DO WE CONSIDER MEMORY?
+===========================
+
+For the purpose of this specification, "memory", at least as far as cached CPU
+vs CPU interactions go, has to include the CPU caches in the system.  Although
+any particular read or write may not actually appear outside of the CPU that
+issued it because the CPU was able to satisfy it from its own cache, it's still
+as if the memory access had taken place as far as the other CPUs are concerned
+since the cache coherency and ejection mechanisms will propegate the effects
+upon conflict.
+
+Consider the system logically as:
+
+	    <--- CPU --->         :       <----------- Memory ----------->
+	                          :

+The CPU core may execute instructions in any order it deems fit, provided the
+expected program causality appears to be maintained.  Some of the instructions
+generate load and store operations which then go into the memory access queue
+to be performed.  The core may place these in the queue in any order it wishes,
+and continue execution until it is forced to wait for an instruction to
+complete.
+
+What memory barriers are concerned with is controlling the order in which
+accesses cross from the CPU side of things to the memory side of things, and
+the order in which the effects are perceived to happen by the other observers
+in the system.
+
+
+Note that the above model does not show uncached memory or I/O accesses.  These
+procede directly from the queue to the memory or the devices, bypassing any
+cache coherency:
