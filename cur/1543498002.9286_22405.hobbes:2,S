Gentlemen,
If you have 100 base-t going into a switch that transfers to a 10 base-t
link, the switch will generate collisions as the only method it has
available to throttle. The old story about a 10 kg blivit in a 1 kg
sack. (substitute lbs of ...t).
Try your system 100-to-100 base and see if it works okay. If so,
grin and bare it until the last 10 mbitter is gone from your LAN.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
