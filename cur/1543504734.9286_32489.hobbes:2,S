FYI A friend's IPC notebook (before it died) had feedback problems on the
default mixer settings.  We had to edit the driver to fix this; we simply
couldn't wait for a usersapce change since it would shreak as soon as the 
driver loaded.
I know IPC notebooks are mis-designed pices of crap but a way to change
the settings on driver load would have been really nice.
