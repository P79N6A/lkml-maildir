It is. The problem is both drivers have opinions about how the card is
configured.

It is probably doable given some Matrox documentation. You need to look at
both XFree setup/restore of the matrox chipset and the fbcon server to be
sure
o	The matrox X server doesnt assume anything about the old mode being
	text mode when it starts, and doesn't rely on bios time configured
	values
o	The matrox X server doesnt fail to restore anything or assume text
	mode restoration. If it can't restore all the state then
o	You need to make sure turning graphics mode off (there is an ioctl
	where the X server tells the kernel its managing the display and
	hands off) that the matrox fbcon rebuilds enough state itself
	to work.
o	Finally that the fbcon code doesnt do anything either it (when you
	set graphics mode) or the Xserver itself cannot recover from.
