Andi has gone and rotorooted the x86 boot parameter handling in there. 
This patch now looks like this:
From: Zachary Amsden <zach@vmware.com>
Add a boot parameter to reserve high linear address space for hypervisors. 
This is necessary to allow dynamically loaded hypervisor modules, which might
not happen until userspace is already running, and also provides a useful tool
to benchmark the performance impact of reduced lowmem address space.
