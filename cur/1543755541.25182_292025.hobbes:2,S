Yep, Synaptics I think has 4-5x higher resolution.

I wonder if we should just add speed factor (along with tap distance)
options to mousedev. Vojtech, will you take such patch? I know you

started switching, it will not happen until distributions (or
XOrg/XFree themselves) have these drivers available straight out of
the box.
