We concentrate on the fault analysis. We think the original aim of the
kexec (== fastboot) differ from the caputuring dump. However,
since we apply the effort of the kexec project to mkdump, we are happy
to return something to the kexec project.

No. If the code or the data structures running from crash occur to the
mini kernel start (although it is very short) is damaged, starting the 
mini kernel will fail.
What we done (and will do partialy) is that the logical possibility of 
the deadlock/hang condition is eliminated from the code running from 
crash occur to the mini kernel start.

What do you mean "the data structures necessary to get there" ?
The necessary information to run the mini kernel and to caputure dump 
is stored in the reserved area at the same time of loading the mini kernel
(during the kernel is normal).
