Greetings,
(please cc me on responses as linux-kernel is not forwarding traffic
to me for some undetermined reason).
I have been been playing with the new vfork syscall... it seems that
the child when embarking down the execve syscall road murders its parent.
No doubt I will appear foolish before the world (Linus, may I borrow the 
brown paper bag please).   
My gut says the solution lies in protecting the parent's stack... but, 
I have yet to figure out the bloody thing.
This bit of code behaves as is expected:
#include "/usr/src/linux-2.2.1/include/asm/unistd.h"
#include <stdio.h>
int main (int argc, char **argv)
{
	int i=0;
	if (!syscall(__NR_vfork)) {
		fprintf(stderr,"%d about to exec child\n",getpid(),++i);
		_exit(0);
	} 
	fprintf(stderr,"%d parent %d\n",getpid(),i);
}
Here the parent suffers a violent SIGSEGV death:
	int i=0;
	if (!syscall(__NR_vfork)) {
		fprintf(stderr,"%d child %d\n",getpid(),++i);
		execlp("echo","echo","I love my parent",0);
	}
	fprintf(stderr,%d parent %d\n",getpid(),++i);
And now a silly circumvention:
	int i=0;
	if (!syscall(__NR_vfork)) {
		fprintf(stderr,"%d child %d\n",getpid(),++i);
		if (!fork())
			execlp("echo","echo","I love my parent",0);
		_exit(0);
	}
	fprintf(stderr,%d parent %d\n",getpid(),++i);
What is the obvious gem that I fail to comprehend here?
