Not so.  On the interrupt that runs the tasklet, on the way out via entry.S, the 
need_resched flag is checked and acted on.  Thus the task switch is done prio to 
getting back to the hlt.

Actually this is not required, especially if preemption is turned on.

Well, it is not tickless, but VST that I am working on :).  The notion is to 
turn off the ticks when in idle and there are not time events in the list.

Yep, me!  But still, I keep a timer around to exit, it is just way more than a 
tick later (depending on what the next entry in the time list needs).
