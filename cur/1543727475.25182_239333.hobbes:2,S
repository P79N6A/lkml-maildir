Thanks for clarifications, David and Andi.
Okay, I now recognize that the difference of layouts, one on 32bit mode 
and one on 64bit mode is the problem.
I'd suggest changing XFRM_MSG_xxx things to 64bit-aware structures,
whose layouts do not change between 64bit mode and 32bit mode.
Of course, they will come with backward compatibility stuff.
If you don't mind this, I'd like to take care of this.
Thanks.
