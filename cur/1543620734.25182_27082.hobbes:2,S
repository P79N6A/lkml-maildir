I don't know what the problem is, but un-inlining this function isn't 
correcting it.
The function thread_saved_pc() is a mystery to me.  It is declared with 
a return type of unsigned long, and yet return this:
((unsigned long *)tsk->thread->esp)[3]
This is confusing to me in many ways:
- the "thread" member of task struct is not a pointer
- esp is of type unsigned long, so I don't understand the cast, and
I certainly don't understand the [3] here.
Can anyone explain this code to me?
I'm a kernelnewbie, so I'm inclined to return:
return (tsk->thread).esp
What is this function trying to do?
