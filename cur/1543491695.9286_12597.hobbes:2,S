This chip is a LVD from/to SE converter and normally it should not require
any software support from the kernel drivers. 
I donnot have the specs of this chip. I read that it is used on some
expensive Tekram board and allows to use both LVD and SE devices on a
single SCSI BUS.
I donnot encourage such a solution at all for performances.  Better to use
2 separate BUSes (1 LVD + 1 SE) that, based on current Tekram pricing,
should not be more expensive than the dual signalling LVD / SE Tekram
board, for example. 
On the other hand, the SCSI protocol has been modified for LVD signalling
in order to avoid release glitches and this protocol changes were intended
to be implemented by devices. As a result, this chip probably just snoops
the SCSI protocol from the SE part and fixes the behaviour of pre-SPI2
devices when passing signals to the LVD part (just a guess from me). 
An expected end-to-end protocol change simulated by some complex chip does
not look good to me. For this second reason I am still not convinced that
this chip is really interesting against a 2 separate controllers solution,
even if it may work perfectly on paper.

   Gérard.
