Oups... I should sleep for at least 9 hours when I wrote it. :-(( It looks 
like a bug.

Hmmm... If I know what canonical non-blocking connect is, I would use it I 
think...
Also I use getsockopt to get an error. I set non-blocking with fcntl.

No. Just usual lameness. I read lot of FAQs, play with the code, and this is 
the combination which works. Actually thttpd also uses this (if I am not 
mistaken).

Eeerrhhh... Let's not touch Berstein, or he will rfuse answering my 
bugreports if I will ever change Postfix to QMail. He is a special guy. QMail 
is the only software I can not read like a book...

The problem here is that I need to tune timeout for: each connection, and for 
connect, and read/write separately. If you could give me an advise how to do 
this more effective, I would be really glad.
Actually the problem was anyway in my app. I have fixed it.
