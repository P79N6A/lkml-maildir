 oh go on: i promise i'll even subscribe to it.  and lots of other
 people will, too [won't we, folks YEERRRRS there you go, dave, see?]
 we want the _right_ kind of attention, and _you_ need somewhere to
 kindly but firmly push the people who are a bit brighter than kernel
 newbies but who still talk 19-to-the-dozen without posting a patch.
 i wouldn't even mind if there was an auto-redirect of certain
 subject lines duly noted "as of right now, all messages with
 this subject are being auto-forwarded to LVML".

 nothing would give me more delight than to see that happen.
 pleaaase, dave: you could even set up a redirect of this subject line
 to forward the messages to LVML instead.
