  This is exactly the same thing -- context switching time depends on what
is shared, so if you made threads with clone(2), they behave like threads,
and they look like any other threads through library interface (one *has*
to have a library interface to threads). The only difference is how they
are numbered in the system.
  "Library-only" implementation of threads means that threads are
implemented in userspace in single process without any explicit support
from scheduler and resources management -- this kind of implementation
doesn't take advantage of SMP and can block process on anything blocking
that happens in any of its thread.
