I have another (IMO strange) observation on move NFS client from kernel 
2.4. to 2.6: drop NFS speed by *~1/3*.
In attachemt is small giff generated by mrtg from data sucked from 
switch SNMP agent. Each day (at night) I perform dayly backups (via NFS) 
and on this plots it visable by dayly high network activity.
Aprox four weeks ago I'm switch on host connected to monitored switch port 
from kernel 2.4 to 2.6. Result can be observer on attached picture by 
reduce maximum bandwitch data transferred on this port by ~1/3 (?!?).
Next smaller drob down (~two weeks ago) which can be observed on this plot 
it is result switchung from UDP to TCP (performed specialy for produce 
some visable data for compare).
~30% drob down NFS client speed on this host isn't critical but probably 
this is kind of top iceberg with some other problems which now exist in 
kernel 2.6. I'm not expert in this area but my frient (Marcin Dalecki) 
says this drop down may have some roots in worse memory management in 
kernel 2.6. Is it can be true or not ?
