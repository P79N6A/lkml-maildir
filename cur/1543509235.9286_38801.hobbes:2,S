Whatever hardware you need, the best is really to use something that can
be atached to the so called pcmcia bus on the SA1100.  You might need some
logic to decode the address and activate a chip-enable signal if you have
more than one port to address.  A GPIO, preferably between 0 and 10, can
be used as interrupt line.
With such a setup around the SA1100, current ISA drivers can be used with
very minimal modifications as long as they aren't using DMA.  The kernel
code for the SA1100 already provides access to that bus through the
in*()/out*() macros.  You then have plenty of choice for an interface 
chip.
