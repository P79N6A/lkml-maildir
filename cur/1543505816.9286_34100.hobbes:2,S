What you're looking for is a construct that's widely used in the kernel to
eliminate races with interrupts f:
struct wait_queue *my_wait_queue = NULL;
foo_irq()
{
	wake_up_interruptible(&my_wait_queue);
}
foo_read()
{
	struct wait_queue wait = { current, NULL };
	current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
	add_wait_queue(&my_wait_queue, &wait);
	/* now start the hardware.  if the interrupt comes in before we
	 * enter schedule, the task is set back to TASK_RUNNING and the
	 * schedule becomes a no-op
	 */
	...
	schedule();
	if (signal_pending(current))
		ret = -ERESTARTSYS;
	...cleanup
	remove_wait_queue(&my_wait_queue, &wait);
	return ret;
}
Basically, a task puts it self onto the list for whatever it is waiting
before it starts the process that will lead to the wakeup.  This solves
the problem with interrupts.  interruptible_sleep_on can only really be
used if you're waiting on another task.  For 2.3, the declaration for
my_wait_queue can become a wait_queue_head_t my_wait_queue; 
init_wait_queue(&my_wait_queue_head_t) (there's a macro for use in
variable declarations), and use DECLARE_WAITQUEUE(wait, current); instead
of defining the structure.  Of course, using macros and always writing the
2.3 form is easier. =)  You may wish to make your driver trigger the data
acquesition and buffer results rather than starting from userland each
time to speed things up.  Also, if latency is a concern rtlinux will be
worth investigating.
