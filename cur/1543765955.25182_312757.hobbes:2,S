Yes but the existing JFFS algorithm does a lot more than that.  It tries
to pack as much data as possible into the output buffer.

If all you need is to compress what's compressible you don't need
pcompress at all.  You just need to call the normal compress method
with the input length clamped by the output buffer size.  If the
function returns OK then it's compressible, otherwise it isn't.
You can even do the existing JFFS loop this way too.
