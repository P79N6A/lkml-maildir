Actually, it does; it compiles and runs on (at least) FreeBSD and The
Hurd. If it doesn't compile, I'd be happy to learn about it, and will
(most likely) incorporate any patches that might be relevant; the
intention, in any case, is for it to compile on anything resembling GCC
and some C library (although I'm quite aware that it probably doesn't
reach that goal at the moment, mostly since I didn't test on anything
else than the above two platforms, and Linux).
