I didn't but some students did.
In a previous life, I did implement a runtime configurable CPU 
scheduling mechanism (implemented on True64, Solaris and Linux) that 
allowed schedulers to be loaded as modules at run time.  This was 
released commercially on True64 and Solaris.  So I know that it can be done.
I have thought about doing something similar for the SPA schedulers 
which differ in only small ways from each other but lack motivation.

 From my POV, the current version of plugsched is considerably simpler 
than it was when I took the code over from Con as I put considerable 
effort into minimizing code overlap in the various schedulers.
I also put considerable effort into minimizing any changes to the load 
balancing code (something Ingo seems to think is a deficiency) and the 
result is that plugsched allows "intra run queue" scheduling to be 
easily modified WITHOUT effecting load balancing.  To my mind scheduling 
and load balancing are orthogonal and keeping them that way simplifies 
things.
As Ingo correctly points out, plugsched does not allow different 
schedulers to be used per CPU but it would not be difficult to modify it 
so that they could.  Although I've considered doing this over the years 
I decided not to as it would just increase the complexity and the amount 
of work required to keep the patch set going.  About six months ago I 
decided to reduce the amount of work I was doing on plugsched (as it was 
obviously never going to be accepted) and now only publish patches 
against the vanilla kernel's major releases (and the only reason that I 
kept doing that is that the download figures indicated that about 80 
users were interested in the experiment).

PS I no longer read LKML (due to time constraints) and would appreciate 
it if I could be CC'd on any e-mails suggesting scheduler changes.
PPS I'm just happy to see that Ingo has finally accepted that the 
vanilla scheduler was badly in need of fixing and don't really care who 
fixes it.
PPS Different schedulers for different aims (i.e. server or work 
station) do make a difference.  E.g. the spa_svr scheduler in plugsched 
does about 1% better on kernbench than the next best scheduler in the bunch.
PPPS Con, fairness isn't always best as humans aren't very altruistic 
and we need to give unfair preference to interactive tasks in order to 
stop the users flinging their PCs out the window.  But the current 
scheduler doesn't do this very well and is also not very good at 
fairness so needs to change.  But the changes need to address 
interactive response and fairness not just fairness.
