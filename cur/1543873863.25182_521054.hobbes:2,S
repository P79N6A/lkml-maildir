Yes, this is probably caused by SMM code trying to emulate a PS/2
keyboard from a (maybe connected or not) USB keyboard. Unfortunately we
have no way to disable this BIOS misfeature in the early boot process. 
Arjan, Len ?????
I built in this test to rule out bogus LAPIC timer calibration values
which are sometimes off by factor 2-10.
But I also built in a calibration against the PM-Timer, which turned out
to be quite reliable and I think the additional verification step is
only necessary for sytems without PM-Timer.
That was a bit over cautious from my side. I send a patch to avoid this
when PM-Timer is available in a separate mail.
