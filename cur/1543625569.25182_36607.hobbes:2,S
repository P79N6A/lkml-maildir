OK, I did the legwork, and it seems that Doug is right.
Unfortunately, this means that, in pinhead's words, I should be
ashamed to post the fix to a public mailing list. Let's do it
this way: if Alan or Marcelo pick it - good. Real oops, real fix,
everyone's happy. Otherwise, I'll ship it with Red Hat kernel under
my own responsibility [I do not promise a hara-kiri if it blows up,
but they will point fingers at me at meetings]
About the second point - we know the module count check is bogus,
but if the attached band aid gets accepted, it may stay.
