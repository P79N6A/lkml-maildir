No. There is a status report that tells you which pieces of hardware
your memory controller sees.  It is just a simple list.

If you can reliably decode an error to a DIMM that DMI reports, then
yes even if DMI gets the label wrong you can reboot and see if the label
you were aiming for is now missing.  The principle is the same.
The difference is that you can't reliably use DMI to decode to a DIMM.
If you look at memory controller registers you can reliably do the
same thing without relying on DMI.  It works every time.
Isn't something that just works, and is not at the mercy of the BIOS
developers with too little time worth doing?
