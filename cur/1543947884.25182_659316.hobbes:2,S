Subject: [PATCH 2/3] fbdev: Make deferred I/O work as advertized
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/25/138

Deferred I/O was utterly broken.  Reading the mmap()ed framebuffer
worked, but writing it made the VM endlessly invoke
vm_ops.page_mkwrite().  That happened because we failed to set
page->mapping and page->index.
The fix is to set them, and clean up properly before the framebuffer
gets released.
Fix extracted from this linux-fbdev-devel message:
