We don't usually abstract out architecture features with function
pointers.  The more standard way is with definitions in
architecture-specific files.  Also, the 
               if(machine_restart)
                       machine_restart(NULL);
stuff is fairly messy, and it would probably be preferable to do
something like this instead:
void machine_restart(void)
{
               if(arch_machine_restart)
                       arch_machine_restart(NULL);
}
Then, let the architectures define arch_machine_restart(), and keep tons
of duplicate if()s from being scattered around.

Not really.  It's architecture specific :)  Some machines simply don't
have a recourse when something that low-level fails.  Is there a case
when something happens that you don't expect?  The three architecures
that I compile for work happily, and as I expect.
