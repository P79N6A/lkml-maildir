Most of the original SGI XFS team went to NetApp. The engineer
who developed the side-band xattr protocol (last I heard he was a
real estate speculator in Florida) spent lots of time with them.
They may not be so hostile to the idea as you seem to think.

Easier may be pragmatic, but that does not make it right.
I suggest, that in my opinion (there, is that sufficiently
non-confrontational?) that Linux and the LSM are much better
served by a general xattr protocol than by adding a single
reccommended attribute.

Well, that's why I keep suggesting security_blob_name.
Do you have something against blobs?

More precisely, I said that there could be a number other than one,
with zero also being an option, and the possibility existing that the
name of the blob might not be an xattr (it could be uid, gid, access
time, or inode number based) and still make a useful LSM.

That would be security_getblob(), would it not?
And if you have that, why do you need the attribute name?

True enough, but like I keep saying, those are both single label
stored in an xattr based MAC systems.
BTW, I prefer "Smack" to SMACK. Much less 1970's.
Thank you.
