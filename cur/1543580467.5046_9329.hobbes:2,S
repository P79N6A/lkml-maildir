Not to make a "mee too" post but...
It's worked flawlessly for me.  Always.  Since it seems to work fine for
just about everyone else, I'd venture to say that it's a board specific
issue, quite likely with the BIOS.  Some other problems seem to have to
do with the memory; I remember the KX133 had some definite problems with
memory timing, especially with large amounts (3 DIMMS were a problem on
some motherboards that were loosely laid out).
My 2 cents,
	David
