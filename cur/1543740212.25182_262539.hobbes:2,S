I'm not sure really if the users of some embedded platform
are all sheering for key management system calls...
I guess they will prefer just something that compiles.

Most of that is optional. When the arch maintainer choses not to
use it you have just unnecessarily  broken the build.
IMHO breaking the build unnecessarily is extremly bad because
it will prevent all testing. And would you really want to hold
up the whole linux testing machinery just for some obscure 
system call? IMHO not a good tradeoff.

I would assume the other maintainers go at least from time to 
time through the i386 diffs and check if they miss anything
(that is what I do). For system calls they do definitely, although
it may take some time.

And causing merging headaches and all kind of other problems.
