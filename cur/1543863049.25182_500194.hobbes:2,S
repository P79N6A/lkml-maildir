No that would be the FIRST DIMM, on Channel 0
Each DIMM has 2 ChipSelect Rows (CSROW)
Each csrow covers two channels across, therefore on a 4 socket memory
array, there are CSROWS 0 and 1 on the first DIMM row and CSROWS 2 and
3 on the second DIMM row.
WWWWWWWWW  XXXXXXXXXXX
YYYYYYYYY  ZZZZZZZZZZZ
The W and the Y DIMMs are channel 0
The X and the Z DIMMs are channel 1
csrows 0 and 1 would cross over Y and Z DIMMs
csrows 2 and 3 would cross over W and X DIMMs
The mapping problem occurs in then identifying each of the above goes
to which silk screen labeled sockets on the mobo.
Usually they are labeled:
H0_DIMM2A   H0_DIMM2B
H0_DIMM1A   H0_DIMM1B
where A is channel 0 and B is channel 1 and
the "DIMM1" would indicate the CSROWs 0 and 1
and "DIMM2" would indicate the CSROWs 2 and 3
The string 'label ""' can be filled in by a userspace script to
properly identify the DIMM silk screen according to the motherboard
used.
The lines with "EDAC MC1:" are EDAC CORE output messages, while the
"EDAC K8:" lines are EDAC Memory Controller driver messages.
"CE" is correctable error 
MC1 is memory controller 1 (0 based)
ECC ChipKill x4 was what found the error and corrected it.
The FRU, (field replaceable unit) is the DIMM located at socket
H1_DIMM1A, according to the labeling I mentioned above.
caveat: the detector is not 100% perfect but gives a general area to
look at, the DIMM specification. Sometimes other errors can cause what
looks like a memory error, but usually a bad memory DIMM is the root
cause of the vast majority of such errors.
In addition, memtest86+ doesn't find all the bad memory in all cases,
but it is still a VERY useful tool
