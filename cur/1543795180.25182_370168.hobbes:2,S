It's not about CPU insert/remove.
It's about a single-threaded process becoming multi-threaded, ie a simple 
"clone()" operation (or doing a shared mmap).
So it needs to be _fast_. 
I would strongly argue that it's not a TLB/PAT operation at all. It has 
nothing to do with the address of the operation. It's a global bit, and 
it's in the cr3 just because that's what gets reloaded on task switching. 
But it could be in the CS register too, for all I care..
