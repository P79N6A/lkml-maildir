RFC 1518 and 1519. Draft standards. Dated September 1993, not all that
recent either. 1519 even has an example with a network mask of
255.255.255.240. 
A/B/C addressing is dead, and has been for a long time. Support for it
only remains to support legacy configurations.
Please let's kill this thread.
