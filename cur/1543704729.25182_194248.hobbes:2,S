Run irqbalanced

I haven't seen it.
You can try if it goes away when you disable ACPI PCI routing
(pci=noacpi)

Ok you run a 64bit kernel. You don't have enough memory to require
the IOMMU. That's fine.

Most likely the Winbond W83627HF
iirc it's not possible in 2.6.1 to enable it. You have to drop the
ISA dependency for "I2C_ISA" in drivers/i2c/busses/Kconfig

You can try if the 32bit program works. If not ask 3ware.
