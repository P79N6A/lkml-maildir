Normally we don't export symbols until there's something in-tree which
needs that export.
Occasionally we'll leave a symbol exported when it has no in-tree users,
because it is part of an API which is exported in toto.  But I don't think
that's the case here.
Adding twenty new unused exports is rather a big deal.  Do you have some
new code pending which will use all these?
