Yes it is wrong, sorry for the waste of time.
In the old version of ipconfig there were a line
	!(dev->flags & (IFF_LOOPBACK | IFF_POINTOPOINT)) &&
which I was used to patch (by hand) to
	!(dev->flags & IFF_LOOPBACK) &&
I confused the first line with
	(dev->flags & (IFF_POINTOPOINT|IFF_BROADCAST)) &&
and wrongly patched it to
        (dev->flags & (IFF_POINTOPOINT))
Don't apply this patch!
