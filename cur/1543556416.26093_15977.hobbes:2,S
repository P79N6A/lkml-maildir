Well that's the last time I run a devel kernel with a nontest
system.  sigh.
Had one directory replaced with a different directory
and also a directory replaced with a file. Possible further
corruption.
I don't think I lost the directories until I did a 'fsck -y'
on the partition. Something to remember.
If anyone has advice on recovering the directories other than
the following links, I'm all ears:
