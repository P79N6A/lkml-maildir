Well, yes.
It depends on the BIOS. Many BIOSes have a setting where you can set the
"power fail mode" to "on", "off" or "as before". Now if you enter S4, the
BIOS might set the mode temporarily to "on" or whatever.
For example, many notebooks (have not tried lots of desktops :-) do a "very
quick boot mode" BIOS itialization if they went through the "proper" S4
sequence. On my toughbook and some FSC notebooks, this speeds up the
"power-button to GRUB"-time from ~10 seconds to ~1-2 seconds. The toughbook
even resumes from disk by just opening the lid.
This all is, however, BIOS specific. I have also seen BIOSes where it did
not matter at all.
If you don't like it, you can easily switch it off by 
"echo shutdown > /sys/power/disk" (in-kernel suspend) or by adding
"shutdown method = shutdown" to /etc/suspend.conf (userspace suspend).
You won't get the blinking light, though :-)
