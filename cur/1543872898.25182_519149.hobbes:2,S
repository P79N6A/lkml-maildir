Hi Kirill,
I thought we can always get from the page to the VMA.  rmap provides
this to us via page->mapping and the 'struct address_space' or anon_vma.
Do we agree on that?
We can also get from the vma to the mm very easily, via vma->vm_mm,
right?
We can also get from a task to the container quite easily.  
So, the only question becomes whether there is a 1:1 relationship
between mm_structs and containers.  Does each mm_struct belong to one
and only one container?  Basically, can a threaded process have
different threads in different containers?
It seems that we could bridge the gap pretty easily by either assigning
each mm_struct to a container directly, or putting some kind of
task-to-mm lookup.  Perhaps just a list like
mm->tasks_using_this_mm_list.
Not rocket science, right?
