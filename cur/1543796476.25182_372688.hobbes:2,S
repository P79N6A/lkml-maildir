Hi!
I am not evil or unsatisfied end-user by any means, it is just quite 
interesting to follow today's lkml posts.
After reading "Linux 2.6.15-rc5: off-line for a week" from Torvalds it 
seems like this:.
a) Torvalds thinks that nobody cares about kernel testing
b) other gurus (they are also only "on-line" testers nowadays) doesn't 
feel good with development model (or at least they have no resources to 
do testing [Torvalds])
c) end-users (or those who are not kernel maintainers) are directed 
permanently to distros kernels and "stay away from kernel.org you 
wanna-bees!"
I can't say is it good or bad but this is interesting at least. I hope 
you guys keep going!
Have  a nice day!
Indrek
