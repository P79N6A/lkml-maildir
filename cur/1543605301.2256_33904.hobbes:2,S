Where (in the conceptual layering of the kernel) does the code cease to be
a derived work and become a "normal use" as allowed in the clase added by
Linus:
  NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
  services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
  of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
Cheers,
