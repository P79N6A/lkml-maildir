    Don't know if anyone else has noticed this but from what I've seen
posted it appears, unless I missed something, the gcc 2.95.2s that have
exibited the bug were compiled for a 386 or a 486 while the one on which it
worked was a 686.  Perhaps the bug only appears on certain gcc
configurations.  Either the build configuration or the default optimization
method(s), if I remember correctly gcc optimizes for the platform (i.e.
i386, i486, i586, etc) it was configured for by default.
