Subject: [RFC] disabling RTC irq during release

Hello,
Looking at other rtc drivers I noticed that during the release()
method we should disable IRQs as follow:
static void ds1307_release(struct device *dev)
{
        struct ds1307   *ds1307 = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
        if (ds1307->irq >= 0) {
                ds1307->irqen = 0;
                ds1307_update_alarm(ds1307);
        }
}
that's the code I put into my patch for ds1339.
But if I wish using RTC IRQ line to turn also the board ON, not just
to put to sleep it, I should leave the IRQ line on!
I think we should add a configuration option who allows developers to
choose if the RTC IRQ line should be disabled or not during release().
Ciao,
Rodolfo
