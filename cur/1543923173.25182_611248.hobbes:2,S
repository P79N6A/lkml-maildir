I've seen SYS5 software that relies on it so we should be careful. Again

We should be detecting at least the obvious case.

Very scientific. I have on SYS5 though not afaik Linux

A good question to ask here would be what subset of deadlock loops on
flock does SYS5 Unix error. I also don't see why you need to solve the
halting problem
If SYSV only spots simple AB - BA deadlocks or taking the same lock twice
yourself then that ought to be sufficient for us too.
