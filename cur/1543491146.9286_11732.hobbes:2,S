tcpdump is been run in the receiver side (on neithan), right?
If there isn't a packet loss in the network it means that soot is
forgotting to send packets. As far as I can tell linux is fine. But it
could also be the lowlevel network on the linux side that doesn't get
packets and so we couldn't see them in the tcp linux layer.
To know if it's the linux network card driver that it's loosing packets
you can simply run tcpdump from a third machine (maybe an HP-UX machine)
and see if such lost packets reaches the linux side or not.
