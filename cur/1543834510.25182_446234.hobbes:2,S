Andi: Which 32bit distro patch are you referring to here?

Indeed i386 still does it. I knew x86-64 had a new ia64 inspired
algorithm, but I didn't realize that they didn't even try to call it in
most cases.
The (untested) patch below will disable it on i386. Matthias, mind
trying it out to see if the TSC sync code is causing the problem?

Yes, that would be good to confirm the issue. :)

Hack out the i386 TSC sync code.
