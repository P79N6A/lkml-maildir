I'm getting unresolved symbols on several modules here (i586, UP). I'd
assume it is a simple matter of adding the missing symbols to the tables,
but due to the recent changes I don't dare to for now.
This I believe is a side effect of the recent changes, in floppy.o:
    pci_io_resource
Missing for some time now in IPv6 and QoS modules:
    neigh_create
    neigh_lookup
    qdisc_copy_stats
Also, possibly recent, in a joystick module:
    parport_write_econtrol
And this in NFS:
    add_to_page_cache_unique
    __find_get_page
    __find_lock_page
