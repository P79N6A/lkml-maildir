Hi manu,
Hauppauge deal with NXP on a daily basis. We have a number of 716x 
products either in the market or coming to market and we can add some 
leverage.
I can push this through our FAE and account manager. Who's your contact 
at NXP that we should make reference to?
Email me privately and we can work together on this.
Regards,
Steve
