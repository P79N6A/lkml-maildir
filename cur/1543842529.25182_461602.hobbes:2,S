Also maintenability, licensing, blah, blah.
Replicating the software stack for each service level one
wishes to provide, if avoidable as it seems to be, isn't such a good idea.
Same sort of reasoning for why containers make sense compared to Xen/VMWare
instances.
Memory resources, by their very nature, will be tougher to account when a
single database/app server services multiple clients and we can essentially
give up on that (taking the approach that only limited recharging can ever
be achieved). But cpu atleast is easy to charge correctly and since that will
also indirectly influence the requests for memory & I/O, its useful to allow
middleware to change the accounting base for a thread/task.
