Just a small progress report. Anecdotally I thought that unpatched
2.6.26.7 was worse than 2.6.25.7, mostly because it hung twice in the ~1
day I was running it where previously it was less frequent than once per
day.
With the patched server the client ran OK for 2.5 days then mysteriously
hung, the logs show none of the normal symptoms and my wife reset it
before I got home so I've no real clue what happened but I'm inclined to
think it was unrelated for now. I'll get back to you in a week or so if
the problem hasn't reoccurred.
Ian.
