OK, thanks that is nice, but I think adding support to get into the /dev
namespace may be a little heavy for things like bonding or ipip.
I did not see tuncfg. From what I could see there were 2 ways to create
new devices. There was a script with mknod and then the ioctl(fd, TUNSETIFF, 
(void *) &ifr).
I could do a similar ioctl for a pure net device but I still need a dummy
socket for creating/destroying devices.
I am going for an embedded system so I want to keep things light.
