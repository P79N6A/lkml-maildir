I read it and was underwhelmed.  anyone who follows linux-kernel
would know that the scheduler is optimized for normal loads.  that is,
those with only a handfull of runnable threads.  people have rearranged 
task_struct before, but that was a while ago, and fast development 
implies high code entropy.  the paper _was_ organized nicely ;)

god, I hope not.  user-level threading is Just Plain Wrong if you can
possibly avoid it.  the only venture in that direction I can imagine
would be Mach-like scheduler activations.  though I'm sure it would take
a pretty major problem with the existing scheduler to motivate Linus &co
to take that step...
