It really does not fly. I run a "damn old" nvidia driver (1.0-4496)
with a little portforward work on a 2.6.15. It is slowly ceasing to
be perfect, but given that 4496 was originally only for 2.4, I'd say
that's good news. (It was first portforwarded by sh.nu to 2.6.4 or so,
until nvidia.com came up with 2.6 support on their own. I then took
the sh.nu port and pf'ed it on my own, and until now, the only things
that make slight gcc warnings are CONFIG_PM_LEGACY and the 4-level-pagetable
stuff. I'd say the API is stable long enough!)
