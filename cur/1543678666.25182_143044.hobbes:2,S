Hi all,
I have looked on google and tryed to find an answer, if
linux kernel supports
Intel Server RAID Controller U3-1LA (SRCU31LA)
but I did not find a clear answer,
please, could somebody tell me if I can use linux (Redhat 9 for example)
with this hw RAID card for raid 1 without problems ?
Thanks a lot
Tomas Zeman
