Andrew Morgan has requested a series of changes.  Since one of these
would involve a change in the on-disk format of file capabilities, I
guess these should (sigh) wait another cycle.
I will try to get that change out the door next, as soon as possible, so
that hopefully there are no more definite blocking requests.
thanks,
