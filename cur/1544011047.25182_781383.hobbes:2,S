Well I'd rather avoid using the x86_64 implementation ever because
unless the chip guys have really screwed up we should be looking at
a difference of at least a factor of 10.
BTW I wasn't very clear in the original email.  You'd only do the
asynchronous operation for CBC/ECB.  For the simple AES case I
suppose we'll just have to stick to the x86_64 fallback.  This'll
really suck for disk encryption but I guess you could always add
an LRW/XTS mode to your code.
Cheers,
