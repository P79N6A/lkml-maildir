In article <0C01A29FBAE24448A792F5C68F5EA47D2172BC@nasdaq.ms.ensim.com>,
you write:
>+#ifdef __KERNEL__
>+char *form_dma_addr_t(char *buf, dma_addr_t a);
>+#endif
>+
How about an typedef for da_buf_t (or similar) so that drivers don't
have to worry about the size of the buffer? And that would also let you
reduce the stack footprint on systems where dma_addr_t is only 32 bits,
although that's probably not going to produce a noticeable benefit.
