Which doesn't address the issue of data in files A, B and C, with
indices in X and Y. This only works if you flush and freeze all the
files at one time, making a perfect backup of one at a time results in
corruption if the database is busy.
My favorite example is usenet news on INN, a bunch of circular spools, a
linear history with two index files, 30-40k overview files, and all of
it changing with perhaps 3.5MB/sec data and 20-50/sec index writes. Far
better done with an application backup!
The point is, backups are hard, for many systems dump is optimal because
it's fast. After that I like cpio (-Hcrc) but that's personal
preference. All have fail cases on volatile data.
