Connection tracking under 2.3/netfilter follows the BSD ipfilter lead:
timeout on idle, established TCP connections is 5 days.  I may
implement TCP probe generation or drop-most-idle if this proves to be
a limitation (Darren Reed assures me that it has not, now we share
ipfilter's ability to widen the port range used).
Note also that sshd has its own timeout, which is configurable by the
user.
