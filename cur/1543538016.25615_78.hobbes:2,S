Agreed!  I _DEFINATELY_ would not want to generally call kmalloc from
printk... even if just because of the performance hit.  This _ONLY_ calls
kmalloc in a situation that would otherwise deadlock.  As far as I know,
this situation can only be induced when debugging (because there are no
printks in the VM stuff by default :), and if someone is debugging, it
would be better to just drop the message than to panic the system due to
debug messages... :)  Hell we could even just set a flat that signifies
"some message was dropped" and the next time prink is entered (safely) it
would print out a message that indicates the situation...
