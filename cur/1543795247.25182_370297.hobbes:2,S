It's the patch series starting with

Judging from the feedback when I sent this patch first, there are people 
who might notice and actually fix these issues.

And it's my job to fix every single such bug before you'd accept 
-Werror-implicit-function-declaration in the CFLAGS?
Yes, these are bugs.
And yes, they do already generate warnings.

-Werror-implicit-function-declaration helps us to avoid a class of 
hard to find _runtime_ errors.
I'm already sending patches to fix all the warnings with 
-Wmissing-prototypes (which is roughly spoken the other side of the 
implicit-function-declaration issue) at least on i386 before I'm 
proposing to add this flag to the global CFLAGS, and while doing this 
I've already found and fixed three _runtime_ errors.
But judging from your comments you might then reject 
-Wmissing-prototypes because it causes warnings on other 
architectures...
IMHO reducing the number of hard to find runtime errors is more 
important than to get allmodconfig compiling in every -mm 
on all architectures.
> The patch is a good one, but it should come last.
Instead of telling me that I have to fix compile breakages with all 
possible .config's on all architectures before you would accept my 
patch, couldn't you be honest and simply tell me to fuck off?
