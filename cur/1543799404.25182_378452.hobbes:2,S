It's on my list. I had this implemented a couple of days ago, but then 
profiled it and it turns out that the scenario isnt actually happening 
in any significant way, not even on the most extreme 512-task workloads.  
So i just removed the extra bloat. But i'll look at this again today, 
together with some 'max delay' statistics.
