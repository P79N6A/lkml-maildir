yeah, there's something more recent. Please do this:
  yum install git
  git-clone git://git.kernel.dk/data/git/fio.git
  cd fio
  git-branch syslet-testing
  git-checkout
this should give you the latest version of the v3 based FIO code. It's 
one generation newer than the one you tried. I mean the snapshot you 
used is meanwhile a /whole/ day old, so it's truly ancient stuff! ;-)
