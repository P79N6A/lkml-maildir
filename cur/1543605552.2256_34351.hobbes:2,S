Exactly the same happens to me. I have to remove and reinsert the card tom 
make it work again. kbdrate is lost too.

Has happened always for me for all kind of network cards and kernels that 
I have tried.

If you are on AC power it does not stop the first time, it just hungs for 
a while. When it comes back to life in about 40-60 seconds, maybe the next 
try to supsend works.
When waking up, sometime the X screen does not appear; I have to go to the 
BIOS setup screen and exit to get it back. I used to reboot til I 
discovered the trick.
