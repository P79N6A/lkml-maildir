The worst case stack usage through XFS occurs when it has to read
metadata blocks in the writeback path when doing an allocation
transaction. This happens when walking the freespace btrees looking
for an extent matching the allocation requirements. As the fileystem
fills up, these btrees will grow and you are more likely not to have
a block inthe btree cached in memory.
So yes, this is a possible reason you hadn't seen any problems early
on.
FWIW, there's also been recent reports of both ext3 and reiser on
LVM blowing 4k stacks, so if you use LVM it probably advisable to
go back to 8k stacks....
Cheers,
Dave.
