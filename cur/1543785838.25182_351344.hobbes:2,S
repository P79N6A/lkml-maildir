This makes no sense. For a script, the shell does not care about the encoding
at all.
Also, currently, people use zillions of encodings, most of which have no
signature, so introducing a signature for UTF-8 does not win anything.
In the future, most people will probably use only UTF-8, so the signature
carries no information.
				Have a nice fortnight
