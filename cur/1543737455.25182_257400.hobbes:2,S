Greg,
This is a patch for PCI code that has no dependencies.
Please note that this patch has been already included in 2.6.9-rc3-mm1.
Please apply.
Thanks,

Name:		add_pcibios_disable_device_hook.patch
Kernel Version:	2.6.9-rc3
Depends:	none
Note:		This patch is already included in 2.6.9-rc3-mm1.
Change Log:
    - Ported to 2.6.9-rc3
    - Chaged to use __attrubute__ ((weak)) instead of modifying all
      arch specific code.
Description:
This patch adds a hook 'pcibios_disable_device()' into
pci_disable_device() to call architecture specific PCI resource
deallocation code. It's a opposite part of pcibios_enable_device().
We need this hook to deallocate architecture specific PCI resource
such as IRQ resource, etc.. This patch is just for adding the hook, so
'pcibios_disable_device()' is defined as a null function on all
architecture so far.
I tested this patch on i386, x86_64 and ia64. But it has not been
tested on other architectures because I don't have these machines.
