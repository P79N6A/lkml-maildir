I was absolutely -not- suggesting volatile behavior for lvalues.
Instead, I am asking for volatile behavior from an -rvalue-.  In the
case of atomic_read(), it is the atomic_t being read from.  In the case
of atomic_set(), it is the atomic_t being written to.  As suggested in
my previous email:
#define atomic_set(v,i)		((*(volatile int *)&(v)->counter) = (i))
#define atomic64_set(v,i)	((*(volatile long *)&(v)->counter) = (i))
Again, the architectures that used to have their "counter" declared
as volatile will lose volatile semantics on atomic_set() with your
patch, which might result in bugs due to overly imaginative compiler
optimizations.  The above would prevent any such bugs from appearing.

No LOCK_PREFIX, thank you!!!  I just want to make sure that the compiler
doesn't push the store down out of a loop, split the store, allow the
store to happen twice (e.g., to allow different code paths to be merged),
and all the other tricks that the C standard permits compilers to pull.
						Thanx, Paul
