Absolutely.  Remember this is all about Freedoms.  Why try to take
away the ability to do something?  Especially when it already exists
and is very usefull.
I recently replaced a firewall "live"  by using mac-address spoofing.
Nobody noticed anything, except for a 30-sec 'hiccup' when traffic
"slowed down."
And really, Richard, If you want to take that argument, why would you
want anybody to change IP's?  Because if one Linux Machine on a LAN
ended up with the same IP of another machine on that LAN, then connectivity
to those two machines is flakey at best.  Or if it took over the IP of
the default GW, then all communication outside of the LAN will stop.
And this _never happens_ in real life?  Yet we still can change IP
addresses freely.  ( e.g., VLANs, Frame Relay DLCIs, ATM, AX.25, DecNet
nodes, etc...)
