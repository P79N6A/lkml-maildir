Now, look, Jörg! Here is one of that fearful examples of a SuSE
employee. Unfriendly, not willing to fix anything, completely ignoring
bug reports!
Seriously, Jörg, stop bashing people, that's getting far beyond just
being impolite.
While I could just killfile you, I still feel that those discussions
are blocking serious development in that sector.
To you, Andreas: Thanks for the patches done in the past, they
actually do improve cdrecord.
Schöne Grüße,
Julien
