The etymology of "until" shows that it bases itself in the middle english
"untill" which is derived from (quote) "un- (see unto) + till" or just
merely (quote) "till".
Looking up "till" gives (quote) "till (til) prep., conj. [OE. til] same
as UNTIL"
That means that "til" is Old English for "till" which when used as a
preposition or conjunction is the same as "until".  (Old English stopped
being used circa 1100AD.)
However, discussing "til" is merely a distraction.  "til" is not "'til".
"'til" is a contraction of "until" where the "'" here denotes the missing
letters ("un").  Just like "he'll" where the "'" denotes the letters "wi"
(giving "he will") or "'70" meaning "1970".
So I'd say that "'til" is as correct as "until" which can, in turn, be
directly replaced by the word "till".  Or at least according to my late
'70s dictionary.
