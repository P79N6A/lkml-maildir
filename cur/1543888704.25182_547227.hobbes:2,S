I'd be glad too if you could get some numbers. I did some benchmarking a 
few weeks ago on x86_64 and I found only a very minimal performance drop 
if the calculation was simplified. 
Note also that a smaller structure means that more page structs can be 
covered by a certain amount of cachelines. Doing the alignment may cause 
more cacheline misses.
