Not speaking for Linus, but in general it seems like the more pull 
requests you send (within reason), the more pulls that occur.  Russell 
and DaveM certainly seem to send frequent, successful pull requests.

Rebasing _inevitably_ causes more headaches than a simple tree update, 
for any downstream consumer of your tree(s).  It is best to avoid wanton 
rebasing.
Think about it:  if someone is pulling and merging your tree, all of a 
sudden, without warning, the entire hash history is rewritten.  So 
rather than a Nice and Friendly minor update, the next time they pull 
your stuff, the downstream user is forced to suffer through either (a) a 
painful merge, or (b) back out your last tree (ugh!) and redo things 
from scratch.
Rebasing might make a pretty history, but it is _not_ fun for random 
consumers of your trees.  It basically punishes people for following 
your tree -- not something you want to do.
