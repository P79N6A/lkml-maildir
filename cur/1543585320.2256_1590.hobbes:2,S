What does /proc/slabinfo report for the number of pages locked down in
the inode and dentry caches? My machine has pretty much every inode in
memory and is using close to 50% of my memory for these (214MB/512MB).
These caches do not seem to be counted towards 'reclaimable' memory by
the new VM and are only pruned when _all_ other attempts to free up
memory have failed.
This becomes very noticeable on a not very fast, small memory machine
(i.e. 48MB sparc-IPC), where 2.2 stays relatively snappy, but 2.4
becomes unusable after an updatedb run.
