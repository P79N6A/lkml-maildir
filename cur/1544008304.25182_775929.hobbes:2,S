A local variable called `i' should always have signed type.  In fact,
it should have `int' type.  Doing
	unsigned i;
is an act of insane vandalism, punishable by spending five additional
years coding in fortran.
I suggest you fix this by giving `i' the type God intended, or by
making it unsigned and then renaming it to something which is not
intended to trick programmers and reviewers.
Sheesh.
