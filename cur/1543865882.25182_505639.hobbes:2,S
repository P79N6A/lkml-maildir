 But that is exactly what you want and need for kdump, isn't it?
 The ELF file did not change, the program header has the last index at
address 0 that you do not want to load because you do not want to
execute the real-mode code. Load the rest and provide the 4 Kbytes
parameter page - it should work.

 Because I think when a program evolves it has to get simpler to generate,
run and maintain/debug - while doing more stuff. The number of assembler
lines has to reduce because they are difficult to maintain.
 Removing a ELF header to modify the binary and stick another ELF header
is not exactly what I think simpler - a bit like linking at a fix address and
then modifying the whole set.

  I also refuses to load a big file at a fixed address before asking the BIOS
 for information, I only crash once the memory when I am pretty sure everything
 seems alright, interruption disabled, just before jumping to the kernel
 entry point. Cannot do that with bzImage. Cannot easily debug without
 this feature.

  Thanks for you comment.
 Etienne.
