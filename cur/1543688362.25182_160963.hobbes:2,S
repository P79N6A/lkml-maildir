Unfortunately my DSL service is ADSL and my uplink is only 256Kbps which
gives me about 25-30KB/s on a typical, non-IPsec FTP upload.  Both SFS
and in-kernel IPsec give approximately the same outbound speed over this
limited link, roughly 20KB/s, which seems about right to me.
I'm using 3des for the encryption algorithm.
DSL is connected via ethernet.
CPU is an AMD K6/2 333Mhz.
I also just thought about the fact that I could test my laptop to see if
this is a CPU related issue.  It's running the same basic kernel but of
course with options for laptop devices enabled and compiled for i686,
etc.  It's a much faster machine, a PIII/1.13Ghz system.  If I still get
roughly the same performance then we can probably safely assume it's not
a CPU constraint.  I'll test the tonight.
I'm also going to try and pull some TCP dump data to see if it gives me
any hints.
Anything else I can answer.
Later,
Tom
