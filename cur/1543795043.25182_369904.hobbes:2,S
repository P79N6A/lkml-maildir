My system has:
2 serial
1 parallel
1 floppy
1 gameport
1 joystick
2 PS/2
2 VGA
1 HPET
1 RTC
In /sys/bus/platform/devices I see this:
floppy.0
i8042
serial8250
shouldn't there be entries for all of the legacy devices?
In /dev
fd0
fd/0
fd/1
fd/2
fd/3
floppy
ttyS0
ttyS1
ttyS2
ttyS3
parport0
parport1
parport2
parport3
lp0
lp1
lp2
lp3
hpet
not sure what serio0/.1 appear as
I don't have joystick/game modules loaded.
Lot's of extra device nodes
We need to start making VGA devices
Plus I have 64 tty devices. Couldn't the tty devices be created
dynamically as they are consumed? Same for the loop and ram devices?
Because /sys isn't right the right devices don't show up in HAL.
