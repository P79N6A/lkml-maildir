Bongani,
 can you try to narrow it down even further, since nobody sees what coul 
dbe wrong..
The easiest way to narrow it down some more is to get a clean 2.6.11, and
get all the broken-out patches in 2.6.11-mm1, and do a binary search.  
Testing just four or five kernels should already have narrowed it down a
lot.
The way to do the binary searach is to get the
	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.11/2.6.11-mm1/2.6.11-mm1-broken-out.tar.gz
 
file, and then to apply half of the patches you do basically
	grep -v '^#' broken-out/series | wc
gives you 821, so start with the 410 first patches:
	grep -v '^#' broken-out/series | head -410 > apply
	cat apply | while read i; do ( cd linux-2.6.11 ; patch -p1 ) < broken-out/$i; done
and then you test that. If that doesn't show the problem, try with 615
patches, and so on..
There are smarter ways to do it than just the brute-force approach, but
they're also more likely to break, and doing the brute-force approach for
a small number of kernels should already pinpoint the problem to just a
few patches, and then that is when it is worth starting to think about it.
