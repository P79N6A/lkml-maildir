	Looking for a PCI WiFi card compatible with Linux kernel -mm or Linus. 
2.4 or 2.6, 2.6 preferred.
	I'd prefer to not deal with Distribution-specific drivers, and I'd 
rather not deal with sourceforge projects that keep getting dropped or 
refuse to support certain branches of the linux-kernel.
	If all else fails, I'd prefer Linux Debian support, or Linux Mandrake.
	I hope this doesn't sound like a n00b q, I'm not normally a newbie.

The Government just announced today the creation of the Neutron Bomb II.
Similar to the Neutron Bomb, the Neutron Bomb II not only kills people
and leaves buildings standing, but also does a little light 
housekeeping.
