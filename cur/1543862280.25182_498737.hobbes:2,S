Sooner or later, every line of code is important.
Shouting any one of them in #ifdef brackets creates
a noisier environment, increasing the chance of missing
another.
And besides ... the other umpteen cpuset hooks all use the
cpuset_*() style macros (except for fs/proc/base.c, which
has its own style ...).
Consistency in style is important in these matters.
