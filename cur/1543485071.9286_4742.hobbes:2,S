Considering the benifit to X if it happened, it would (overall)
be not only simplification and problem solving, but would add
inherent flexibility to X and any other proggie using the vidcard.

Look, I'm not going to debate whether I or you or Joe would have need
for this kernel facility, just that it is useful, and simplifies the
job that X (and ALL other possible graphics progs) have to do.
That having been said, please forgive me if I seem ignorant on this
subject, I'm only familiar with the basic points.

X is a little big for just being a way to scribble on a screen and
get accel. I hope you don't disagree here. ;|

Admittedly this is a HUGE problem, but no one is forced to use ANY
video support in ANY kernel. Whatever is supported is supported...
The idea, also, is low-level support, not some high level API. This
simplifies the whole idea.

Ask Jon Taylor. He's like a 3D god or something! Man, reading that
guy's posts... Dude knows what he's talking about.

We're not talking about implementing some high level API in kernel
land like OpenGL. Past what I've just said here, I'm admittedly very
unqualified to comment further on that. See someone like Jon Taylor
for real knowhow.

For cripes sake folks, the guy only talks of a driver interface.
The way X works, it has to do kernel space *kinds* of things
in order to work. Noone else thinks this is bad?
