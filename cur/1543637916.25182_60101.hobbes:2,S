what's subtle exactly? I found the SD_MAJOR >>4, << 8 >> 8 16 devnum <<
4 in sd.c subtle, this doesn't look subtle to me. The code simply avoids
to rebalance the current idle cpu if the sibling isn't idle too and it
tries to idle reschedule another idle package (with both sibling idle)
instead. The coding is in coherent style with the rest of the o1
scheduler as far I can tell.
