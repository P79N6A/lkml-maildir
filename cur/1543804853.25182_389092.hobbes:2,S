I believe that, if you want to maintain a 2.6.13.y (for example) tree 
after the -stable team has moved on, you'd be perfectly welcome, and could 
probably even do it on kernel.org. It might not even be that hard to get 
the necessary patches, given that -stable sees all of the long-standing 
stability/security bugs (so you can watch that list for ones you should 
include patches for), and the regressions will probably mostly be fixed 
before you get the series.
I think that the reason that nobody's done this already isn't that it 
would be very difficult, but that distributions don't actually see a value 
in using old kernel series and are happy with -stable. If you have a 
reason to stick with a series longer, it might be worth the trouble to 
you.
