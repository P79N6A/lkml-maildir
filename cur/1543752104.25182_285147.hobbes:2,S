I thought this was a good idea a number of months ago myself when I saw
a patch for 2.4.x implementing this from Kirill Korotaev, so I ported
that code to 2.6.x and it got merged in -mm then. That patch was merged
into Linus' bk shortly after 2.6.10. Could you check Linus' bk to see
if what made it there resolves the issue as well as your own?
