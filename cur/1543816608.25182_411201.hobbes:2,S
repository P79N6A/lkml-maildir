You can give it a spin in the 'ncq' branch in the block layer git repo:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/axboe/linux-2.6-block.git
Only one real bit needs to get merged in libata for ncq to be submitted,
and that is Tejun's eh rework. Once that is in, ncq becomes a fairly
small patch and can probably go straight in.
AHCI is still the only supported controller, once NCQ is merged I'm sure
a few others will follow.
