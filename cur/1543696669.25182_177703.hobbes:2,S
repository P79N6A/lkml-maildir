Subject: [PATCH] zero out i_blocks in get_pipe_inode
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Fished from the 2.4 SuSE tree, which I'm trawling through.
This seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to do to me,
there was some discussion earlier on IRC. Some extracts from
the conversation were "returning random old data from the kernel 
is always a bug", "any userland code that trips on that one is 
broken", and "iirc it broke postfix". Nobody seemed to think it
was actively evil, and it seems to fix a bug ;-)
