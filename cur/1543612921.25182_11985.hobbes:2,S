It does not have to be contiguous. I was thinking of simply starting with 
the smallest address and trying to free the pages until the needed amount 
is available. But I have no idea how to properly do locking or force the
page to be swapped out or something. 
As for doing this during boot time this does not seem like a good idea for
two reasons: 
  a) I need at least _two_ buffers 300K each
  b) the actual amount of RAM needed changes depending on video standard
     (this is for video capture).
