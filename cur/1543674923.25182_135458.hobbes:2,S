if you are using bk, maybe not all files were checked out? Try
bk -r get
and if the error still does not go away,
make mrproper
and then
make {,x,menu}config
make dep does nothing in 2.5 and make bzImage is standard target, so you
can abbreviate you command line to
make && make modules && sudo make modules_install
