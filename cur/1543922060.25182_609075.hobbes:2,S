The specific goal is to be able to enable the XEN option in our native kernel,
which gets configured with M586. So we could live with XEN depending on
X86_CMPXCHG, but would definitely need the dependency on X86_TSC
dropped. Nevertheless I'd favor even X86_CMPXCHG dropped unless that
causes unresolvable (or difficult to resolve) problems.
