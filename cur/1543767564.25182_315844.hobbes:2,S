Not really; it's just a quick hack applied without any real
consideration of the problem. If we're messing up the baud rate when we
change the master clock, then just make it change the divisor
accordingly at the same time. We don't seem to store the active
parameters of the serial console anywhere useful; we can do it just by
reading back the divisor and multiplying by eight though...
Tom, does this also mean you don't need the 'ifndef ppc'?
