Hey, I can now compile a kernel while running pre-2.3.11-8 SMP AND install
the resulting package with dpkg! PROGRESS!
umsdos and minix file systems are still not building as modules for me but
I don't use them anyway so it is no loss here.
I now get TWO "beer drinking penguin" logos on my boot screen for the
price of one ... don't know what all that is about.
Now to beat it around a little and see what stuffing flies out of it.
