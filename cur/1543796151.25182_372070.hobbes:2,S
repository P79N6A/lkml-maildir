Hi,
Using the same config between 2.6.14 and 2.6.15-rc2 (and with rc3,
haven't tried rc4). The mousedev gets auto loaded on 2.6.14 but does not
with 2.6.15-rc{2,3}.  Did something change to prevent the auto loading
of mousedev?
So on 2.6.14, the X server starts without a problem on boot up.  But now
on 2.6.15-rc2 it doesn't (missing mouse pointer).  Yes I know that I can
add this to the modules.conf file, but I'm curious to what changed.
I'm using Debian/unstable.
