Please retest with hdc=... parameter removed. If hd[a-z]=...
parameter is specified, my patch will be disabled, trusting
whatever user has specified.
Here's a example output of what you should expect if the patched
part is being executed:
  hda: host protected area => 1
  hda: checking for max native LBA...
  hda: max native LBA is 90045647
  hda: (un)clipping max LBA...
  hda: max LBA (un)clipped to 90045647
  hda: lba = 1, cap = 90045647
  hda: 90045647 sectors (46103 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=89330/16/63, UDMA(33)
  hdc: host protected area => 1
  hdc: checking for max native LBA...
  hdc: max native LBA is 90045647
  hdc: (un)clipping max LBA...
  hdc: max LBA (un)clipped to 90045647
  hdc: lba = 1, cap = 90045647
  hdc: 90045647 sectors (46103 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=89330/16/63, UDMA(33)
