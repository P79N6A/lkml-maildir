Subject: [PATCH 000 of 5] Introductory patches for bio refactor.

Hi Jens,
 I wonder if you would accept these patches the block layer.
 They are, as far as I can tell, quite uncontroversial and provide
 good cleanups.
 The first is a minor bug-fix.
 The next to replace helper function that take a bio (always the first
 bio of a request), to instead take a request.
 The last two combine to replace rq_for_each_bio with
 rq_for_each_segment which makes blk_recalc_rq_segments a lot
 cleaner, and improves (to a lesser degree) every other place that
 used rq_for_each_bio.
 The net result is a decrease in object code size (for my x86-64 compile)
 for block/built-in.o of 96 bytes, though there is some growth out in
 drivers making and over-all decrease of only 48 bytes.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
