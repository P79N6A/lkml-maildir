Well, while we are slowing things down in the name of debugging..
you might try setting the following debug options in your config:
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER 
Can anyone think of anything else?
According to the website you don't have these on right now.
