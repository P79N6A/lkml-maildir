How about only moving memory back to the Memory Node (zone) that it
came from?  And providing some call that Christoph Lameters migration
code can call, to disable or fix this up, so you don't end up bringing
back pages on their pre-migration nodes?
Just honoring the memory node placement should be sufficient.  No need
to wrap your head around cpusets.
If you don't do that, then consider disabling this thing entirely
if CONFIG_NUMA is enabled.  This swap prefetching sounds like it
could be a loose canon ball in a NUMA box.
As for non-NUMA boxes, like my humble desktop PC, I would -love-
to have Firefox come back up faster in the morning.  I have a nightly
cron jobs push everything out to swap, and it is slow going getting it
back.
The day will come (it has already gotten there for some of my
colleagues who are using a small Altix system for their desktop
software) when we want this prefetching for NUMA boxes too.
