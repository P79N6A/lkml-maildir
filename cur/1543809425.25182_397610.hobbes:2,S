No, the old kernels still have all the bugs they ever did (of course).
I tested it during the st-iommu-doublefree debugging.  I do not plan on
running the old kernel again, mainly because it has so many irritating
bugs (df doesn't work, the serial console stalls on boot, so it won't
boot without handholding, etc. etc.).  I'd have to run it for at least a
month to verify, and the old kernel has security vulnerabilities and so
on.
The sensors report a bunch of obvious nonsesne as always...  I keep them
configured in with the hope that one day they'll report useful
information, but that day hasn't come yet.  I just checked, and all the
fans are still fine.  It's in a huge case with lots of fans and it's
hardly warmer than room temp.  The opteron 240s don't put out much heat.
I'm still thououghly convinced it's a kernel bug.
