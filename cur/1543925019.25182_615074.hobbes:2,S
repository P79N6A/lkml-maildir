I've read the threads, but this does little to do with the fact it's
still a perfectly valid vector, and I'm not about to force every IRQ
vector on my platform off-by-1 in order to satisfy a religious point of
view with zero reflection on what the hardware actually looks like.
So I'll change the check to IRQ#0 == invalid, but if that's to be
enforced kernel-wide, then all of the existing NO_IRQ cases should be
ripped out and set to 0. This way at least people are getting screwed
consistently, rather than just in particular subsystems.

Spoken like someone who doesn't have to contend with off-by-1 IRQ
vectors as a result of an entirely cosmetic change. It's certainly easier
to parrot a party line when you aren't being bitten by it.
So again, I'll make the change, but it's utter nonsense.
