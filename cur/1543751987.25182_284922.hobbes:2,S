Here's what I suggest.  Look at the kernel header files,
in particular: include/linux/init.h .
Find /module_init/ in that header file.
It has different #defines depending on whether the
including file (e.g., pipe.c) is being
built as a module or not (#ifdef MODULE).
Once you have found that module_init() means __initcall(),
then you can find that __initcall() means device_initcall(),
which in turns means define_initcall("6",fn);
which is a (normal, common) method of setting up a
"module" (functional module, not only for separate
loadable modules) initialization entry point.
There, darn, I've said too much and my rubout key
doesn't work.
