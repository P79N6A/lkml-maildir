Having just said that I couldn't reproduce it on my alpha, I may have just
done so on my PC.
While the computer was backing up from a cron job this morning, it hung
while it was executing this script fragment:
echo "Backing-up old backups"
mount ${OLD} || exit 1
/sbin/modprobe ppa || exit 1
mount ${ZIP} || exit 1
rm -f ${OLD}/*.bz2
for source in $TARGETS; do \
	echo "${ZIP}/${source} -> ${OLD}/${source}"
	cp -f ${ZIP}/${source} ${OLD}/${source}
done
umount ${OLD}
I can tell that it was this fragment because the ${OLD} partition was not
cleanly unmounted, and this is the only time it gets used at all.
The ${OLD} partition is ext2, and ${ZIP} (the Zip drive) is vfat.
This backup happens every morning, and I have seen this behaviour maybe
once or twice before (which I reported).
I'll try to find a way to reproduce this.
Tim.
