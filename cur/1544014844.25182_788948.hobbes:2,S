Please use ETH_P_8021Q from linux/if_ether.h instead of inventing
your own definition.

Please do not add code that is just going to be commented
out and not used.
Also, I disagree with the:
+#if defined(CONFIG_VLAN_8021Q) || defined(CONFIG_VLAN_8021Q_MODULE)
conditional.  Probably this part of the chip should be programmed
unconditionally.
We can get VLAN packets received and sent, using AF_PACKET
sockets, for example.  The chip should still respect those
even if VLAN proper is not being utilized.
