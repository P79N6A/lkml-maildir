Excellent!

No, that's not what I'm talking about.  I'm just talking about disk
performance.  If you use regular fdatasync then you avoid letting the
kernel accumulate a huge queue of dirty writeback buffers in the
buffer cache.  If you don't use synchronous writes, then your
writeback queue grows to the point that when the bdflush task
eventually decides to flush things out, it can clog the disk request
queues for a substantial period.
In other words, I was talking about the impact of your disk write
behaviour on the performance of _other_ threads.  If you don't let the
writebehind queues grow too large, then you prevent other threads from
seeing large latencies in their own disk IOs (including reads).  If
you are concerned about the latency of the application which is
writing the data in the first place, then obviously a multi-threaded
model where you acquire the data and write to disk in different
threads is the way to go.

Yes, I'll think about this a bit once I'm back home (I'm offline right
now).
