Subject: UPDATE : 5*36.5 GB SoftRAID problem

This is an update to my previous mail about problem with the 5*36.5 GB
Soft RAID setup.
I'm not sure if this problem is RAID or Ext2 related. I just created a
new raid (without creating any filesystem etc. until the rebuild
finished).
When fsck:ing a _NEW_ filesystem (no options where used when creating
it), fsck complains _a lot_.
I even got the error:
"Unattached inode 1049263
Connect to /lost+found<y>? yes
WARNING: PROGRAMMING BUG IN E2FSCK!
        OR SOME BONEHEAD (YOU) IS CHECKING A MOUNTED (LIVE) FILESYSTEM."
--------------------------------------
Since my last try have I also uppgraded to the latest
(ide.2.2.13.19991104.patch) ide patch. But it does not seem to help.
Any help would be very appreciated.
