I don't see how multiple source trees can be merged automatically with
100% accuracy.  
What happens when you build with linus-tree, xfs-tree, and
reiserfs-tree, and both XFS and reiserfs touch struct file_operations,
in conflicting ways?  It takes human intervention to figure that stuff
out and resolve such conflicts.
If you support multiple source trees -> single build tree, it sounds
like are you trying to integrate cvs/diff/similar into the kernel build
system, which is whacky...
