Ok, here I am again; doing some benchmarking :)
(all this is done with same hardware as before, and your tg3 v0.94 driver in
both ends):
test8:/usr/src/LMbench/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu# ./bw_tcp 129.241.56.160
initial bandwidth measurement: move=10485760, usecs=117352: 89.35 MB/sec
move=693633024, XFERSIZE=65536
Socket bandwidth using 129.241.56.160: 104.73 MB/sec
test8:/usr/src/LMbench/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu# ./lat_tcp 129.241.56.160
TCP latency using 129.241.56.160: 100.0089 microseconds
Do you want any more benchmark; just say so :)
