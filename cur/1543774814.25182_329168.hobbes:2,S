I think this still qualifies as calling generic_delete_inode because it's
a trivial wrapper.  Manipulating i_nlink seems rather odd to me, I'd
say you should rather call into generic_delete_inode directly if
OCFS2_INODE_MAYBE_ORPHANED is set (that's what generic_drop_inode will
do for i_nlink == 0 anyway).
In fact given every cluster and possibly many network filesystems will
need this it might make sense to take the OCFS2_INODE_MAYBE_ORPHANED into
the VFS, i.e. make it an i_state flag (after fixing can_unuse to not do
something totally stupid with i_state)
