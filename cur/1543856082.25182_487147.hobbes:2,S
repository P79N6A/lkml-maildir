Ok, I'm trying to debug it, and it's a pain.  It's a timing issue,
mmcfg write accesses are too slow for something.  The get_base_addr()
call is enough to slow things down too much, which explains why the
fundamentally simpler x86-64 code works without a hitch.
Finding out what it is too slow for, though, is an interesting
proposition.  It's not entirely obvious it is actually related to the
sata accesses.
  OG.
