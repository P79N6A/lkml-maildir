There are three cases:
0)  start == 0
1)  0 < start < buffer
2)  start >= buffer
These exhaust all the possible values that can be returned
in *start.
You propose to change the code so that there are three cases:
0)  start == 0
1') 0 < start < PROC_BLOCK_SIZE
2'/3) start >= PROC_BLOCK_SIZE
However, we can't make the change you propose because it would
break functions that use case #1 with a *start value greater
than PROC_BLOCK_SIZE.

Yes.

start will be used as an offset, not as a length.
If you think the hack was a bad idea, I agree with you.
But we can't change it without auditing all the proc read
functions that use case #1.
