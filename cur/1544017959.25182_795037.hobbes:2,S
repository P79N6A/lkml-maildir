I already tested squashfs. One issue is basically a problem with
the zlib-api for which i just posted a patch here
http://marc.info/?t=123212807300003&r=1&w=2
The other is an overwritten redzone (also reported in this thread
http://marc.info/?l=linux-fsdevel&m=123212794425497&w=2
)
Looks like a length parameter is passed to squashfs_read_data
which is bigger than ((msblk->block_size >> msblk->devblksize_log2) +
1), so the kcalloced buffer gets overwritten later. Maybe you want to
take a look at this issue. Those are the only two problems i have
seen so far with ~8000 tested squashfs images.
