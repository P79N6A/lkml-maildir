If the speaker system has no analog input for those channels, then there 
is no way to play back content through them unless it is Dolby Digital 
encoded. (There's no way to put more than 2-channel audio through SPDIF 
unless it's encoded such as by Dolby Digital or DTS.) The sound card is 
not capable of doing this, so if the content is not Dolby Digital 
already, this would have to be handled by some software.
