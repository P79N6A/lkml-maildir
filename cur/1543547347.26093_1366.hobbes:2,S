I have had several sites reject mail from me because it's being sent
from a rr.com IP (notably sdesigns.com).  I had to use a shell acct
from another system to send it.  It's very annoying but I don't think
there's much to be done if they decide they don't want mail coming from
rr.com.

What the hell is content? Nobody buys content. Real people pay money
for music because it means something to them. A great song is not just
something to take up space on a Web site next to stock market quotes
and baseball scores.
