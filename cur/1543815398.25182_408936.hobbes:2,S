Yes, Catherine was told that she shouldn't be directly exporting
security_sid_to_context, and was allegedly working on a fix.  Note
however that the expected solution is not a LSM interface but a set of
properly encapsulated interfaces exported directly from SELinux, based
on the iptables context matching patches by James.  The same style of
interface is being put forth for the audit LSPP work.  The indirection
of LSM serves no purpose here, as these users are specifically looking
for functionality provided only by SELinux.

No permission check there, but it looks like it does read lock
sk_callback_lock.  Not sure if that is truly justified here.
