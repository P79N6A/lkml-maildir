I'd like to raise motivation a lot because most MB sold here (central 
Europe) are Nforce4 with Athlon64x2 at the moment. It would be nice 
from vendors if they support OSS developers more, as it's their 
interest to have good drivers.
For the moment, I'd recommend *against* using Nforce4 because of that 
problems we had (and that caused us a lot of unpaid repairing work). 
Hopefully NV does something quick to resolve the remaining issues, 
especially as the 4GB "border" is hit more and more often.
