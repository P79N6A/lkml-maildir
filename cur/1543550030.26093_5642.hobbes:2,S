I have had this problem since test7.
Modprobe complains when I try to load the soundblaster module:
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test9/kernel/drivers/sound/sb.o: init_module: No such
device
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters, including
invalid IO or IRQ parameters
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test9/kernel/drivers/sound/sb.o: insmod
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test9/kernel/drivers/sound/sb.o failed
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test9/kernel/drivers/sound/sb.o: insmod sb failed
Then, on startup it notices DMA channels 1 & 5 were left allocated and
frees them.
I have a SB-AWE64 PnP bulk, which has vorked fine with 2.2, 2.3 and
2.4.0test until now.
My config has NOT changed since 2.4.0t6.
This is extra-annoying using gnome since a lot of programs try to find esd
(which isn't there) and delay some 5-10 seconds on startup.
Thanx in advance, Robert.
