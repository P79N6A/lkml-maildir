OK, that's roughly what I was expecting.  These processor chips tend to
be rather basic when it comes to rates and widths.
The root cause, I think, is that the aic7xxx isn't starting out at async
narrow for the first inquiry (because the original DV code I removed did
this, and I didn't add an equivalent back).  The latest aic7xxx patch
should sort this out.
So, to get all of these changes, could you start with vanilla linus
kernel 2.6.12-rc4 (or tree based on this, but not -mm which already has
some of the SCSI tree included) and then apply the SCSI patch at
http://parisc-linux.org/~jejb/scsi_diffs/scsi-misc-2.6.diff
and see if it works?
Thanks,
James
