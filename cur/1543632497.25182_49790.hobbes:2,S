If I remember correctly, back in January we (we being Andrew Morton
and myself) talked about my 3C905C-TX not willing to share an
interrupt with my SBLive!...
I've spotted the same problem, this time sharing an interrupt
between my 3C905C-TX and an Intel i82559 10/100 ethernet
controller (kernel is 2.4.19pre7).
The situation is a bit different : using the 3C905C with the
SBLive! resulted in a total lock-up of the machine, whereas using both
network cards usually generate network timeouts and weird errors.
Putting the cards in separate (meaning different IRQ lines) PCI
slots solved the problem (same solution than between 3C905 and
SBLive!). All 3 cards are now working perfectly, at the same time.
Motherboard is MSI BXMaster (i440BX).
