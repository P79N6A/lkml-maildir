drivers/block/z2ram.c does this for RAM in the Amiga Zorro II space.

 with a Zorro III bus because on those machines Zorro II RAM doesn't support
 read-modify-write cycles.)

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
