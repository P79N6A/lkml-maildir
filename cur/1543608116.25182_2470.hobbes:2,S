I have to say, I can't remember ever seeing
a lockup in q3 with this system - DRI has been
very well behaved.
Now, sometimes a 3d xscreensaver module
will freeze and lock the console, but if I log in
from a serial port or from the net, I can kill the
module and the console is freed up again.
With the wolfenstein demo, there are some long
hangs, but it appears to be strictly an application
issue - if I press escape repeatedly, it usually
recovers. If it doesn't recover, I can always
run "[ALT][SYSRQ] k" and get back to the gdm
login screen.
There have been some buggy test kernels that
collapsed of their own accord, but I must say,
no app has ever taken the system down with
a production kernel, nor with any linus kernel
newer than 2.4.10 on this UP system.
To recap:
------------
PIII-933 on intel mobo
512 MB RAM
2x30 GB maxtor ide
Voodoo 3 2000 AGP
Red Hat 7.1 + XFree 4.1.0-3 from rawhide
kernel 2.4.14-pre6+preempt-2.4.14-pre5-1+2.4.13-low-latency.patch
