Same here. I've got a Dell XPS H266 with the mobo Yamaha OPL3-SA3, and had it 
working fine with 2.0.36 (RH 5.2) using RedHat's soundconf. Upgrading to 2.2.x 
broke it, and also soundconf. I tried to configure it with isapnp, but no joy. 
The OSS demo driver works fine.
One of these days I'll get RH 6.0 from cheapbytes and try soundconf again.
