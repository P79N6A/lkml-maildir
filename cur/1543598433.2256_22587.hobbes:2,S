	This makes no difference at all. It comes down to, ultimately, the
difference between adding 'X' and 'Y' to an entropy pool or 'X' and 'X+Y'.
The set 'X','Y' has the same amount of entropy as the set 'X','X+Y'. Either
the time at which events occur contains entropy or it doesn't. No amount of
math can increase the amount of entropy present in those times. Sorry.
