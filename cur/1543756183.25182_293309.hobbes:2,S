This change looks very bogus, what are you trying to fix here?
if pty_driver->subtype == PTY_TYPE_MASTER, a node ptyXY has to be created.
if pty_driver->subtype == PTY_TYPE_SLAVE, a node ttyXY has to be created.
See Documentation/devices.txt, line 108ff and 183ff
With your change, the ttyXY becomes ptyXY? Why does that fix anything?
Do you have an outdated udev package with bogus udev.rules?
