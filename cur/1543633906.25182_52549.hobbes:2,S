No, the commercial/licensed 4.2.10-1.

Good old 53c810 rev 01 and Exabyte Mammoth EXB-8900.
The tape shares SCSI bus with one SCSI disk (this
machine is equipped with just one disk, an old Seagate
Barracuda ST32550N). I believe we're sometimes pushing
this hardware up to its limits when backing up fast
machines over a switched 100Mbps. No errors though.

Can't tell, I have never used Arkeia in real world setups
with an Adaptec card. For tests, yes, but not in a prodution
environments.
