I'm starting to install some fedora core 3 systems in an environment
where 64bits SGIs are still serving the home directories.  They have
the bug/feature that required the 2.4 patch to hack the 64bits
cookies[1].  The 2.6 kernel I just found still can't compensate by
itself for the issue.
Is there an easy way to fix that?
  OG.
