(my reply was supposed to be off-list, but..)
The answer appears to be yes, there are down-sides.  Instead of the 
expected throughput gain, I got a loss :-/  which makes sense from the 
cache side I suppose.  While it was instant gratification for the pipe 
testcase, as a general solution it leaves something to be desired... at 
least when implemented in it's simplest form  Oh well.
(hmm.. maybe I should go stare at the cache decay stuff some more.  later)
