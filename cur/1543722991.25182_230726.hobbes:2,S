Note also that I don't want to apply hacks to 8250 _unless_ there is a
clear method to remove those hacks in a later kernel.
To put it another way, I want to see the clean solution, preferably
already developed and reviewed ready for the next development series
before applying the hack to the stable version.
Without this step, we have historically added hacks to the old serial
driver and forgotten about them, because the problem is no longer in
peoples minds.
IOW, I don't have any objection to adding hacks to work around
problems in the same series _provided_ we have a clear way to resolve
those hacks in the next development kernel series.
