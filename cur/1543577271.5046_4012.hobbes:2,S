You're obviously wrong.
The higher was the load, the faster your working set was getting dropped from
the dcache. (with the patch the working set will have a chance to remains in
cache also with polluting going on instead, that's the whole point of aging:
to find out if something is worthwhile to keep in cache or not)
So the higher the VFS load definitely the higher improvement you will get.
The example with only pollution in the cache doesn't make sense, if you want to
optimize that case then remove the dcache in first place since it's only
overhead for such case.
