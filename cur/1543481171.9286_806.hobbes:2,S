I just wanted to thank you Jim, along with Gregory Maxwell, for
answering my questions straightforwardly.
You two are the only ones who responded without a serious attitude
problem. You actually took the time to explain without suggesting
things like "Go use windows" that seems to be so pervasive within the
Linux community. Nor did you suggest that because I value RAM , which
is so important under Win95/98, that I am some sort of idiot or threat
to the Linux community.
Basically... thanks for helping me learn. Even though to some, those
without their level of knowledge, who are incidently trying to learn,
are idiots and should be burnt alive at the stake.
