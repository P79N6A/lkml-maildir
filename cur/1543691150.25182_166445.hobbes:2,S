Dave,
With 2.6.0-test5, the generated alias for agpgart
in modules.alias looks wrong:
alias char-major-10-AGPGART_MINOR agpgart
Surely that should be char-major-10-175.
The problem is that AGP's MODULE_ALIAS_MISCDEV() is in
backend.c, but AGPGART_MINOR isn't #define:d there
because agpgart.h is only #include:d in frontend.c.
This causes MODULE_ALIAS_MISCDEV()'s __stringify()
to convert the token itself rather than its value.
Should be easy to fix (move the ALIAS or add #include).
