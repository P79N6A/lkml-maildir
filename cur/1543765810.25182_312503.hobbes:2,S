Yep.  Once you have other tasks waiting on your window while it's not
locked, object lifetime becomes a much bigger problem.

I was thinking rather that we _start_ with the window, and _then_ look
for new space.
So we'd start with:
if we already have a window, 
	mark it provisional; 
else,
	do
		search for a new window;
		if the immediately preceding window is provisional, 
			wait for that window;
			continue;
		allocate the window and mark it provisional;
		break
At this point we have a provisional window, and we know that nobody else
is going to allocate either in it, or in the empty space following it
(because if they tried to, they'd bump into our own provisional window
as their predecessor and would wait for us.)  So even if the window
doesn't occupy the _whole_ unreserved area, we can still keep searching
without fear of multiple tasks trying to do so in the same space at the
same time.
