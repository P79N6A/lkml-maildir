I did not express myself clearly then.  Compared to our current 
anti-deadlock patch set, you patch set is a regression.  Because 
without help from some of our other patches, it does deadlock.  
Obviously, we cannot have that.

That depends on how rarely used.  Under continuous, heavy load this may 
not be rare at all.  This must be measured.

I agree that Peter's patch set is larger than necessary.  I do not agree 
that it couples subsystems unnecessarily.

I do not agree with that line of thinking.  A single test load only 
provides evidence, not proof.  Your approach is not obviously correct, 
quite the contrary.  The tested patch set does not help atomic alloc at 
all, which is clearly a problem we can hit, we just did not hit it this 
time.

Alas, I communicated exactly the opposite of what I intended.  We do not 
like the global dirty limit.  It makes the vm complex and fragile, 
unnecessarily.  We favor an approach that places less reliance on the 
global dirty limit so that we can remove some of the fragile and hard 
to support workarounds we have had to implement because of it.

These results do not show that at all, I apologize for not making that 
sufficiently clear.
