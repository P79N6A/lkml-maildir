This is NOT necessarily true in the generic case.
The lazy TLB thread itself may not write to the address space, but I can
in theory see a hardware implementation that delays writing out the dirty
bit from the TLB until it is invalidated. I agree that it is unlikely,
especially on an x86, but I think it's a case we should at least think
about for the generic kernel architecture.
Think of the TLB as a cache, and think of the dirty state as being either
write-through or write-back. Now, I will bet you that all current x86's
 (a) _do_ actually check the P bit when writing D (ie current Linux code
     is probably fine as-is, even if incorrect in theory)
and
  (b) the D bit is write-through.
But even so, I want people to at least consider the case of a write-back
TLB dirty bit, in which case the real state of the D bit might not be
known until a TLB flush has been done (even on a UP machine - which is why
I'm certain that no current x86 actually does this optimization).
(And because of (a), I don't think I'll necessarily fix this during 2.4.x
anyway unless it gets fixed as a result of the generic TLB shootdown issue
which has nothing at all to do with the D bit)
Don't get too hung up on implementation details when designing a good
architecture for this thing.
