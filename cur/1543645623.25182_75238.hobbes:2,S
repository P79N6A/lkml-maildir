1. There is a distinct dearth (hmm an anagram of redhat) of loops.
2. When trashing the source like this you may as well remove
    trailing whitespace (reduces kernel by 200K after compression).
3. What's the difference in size between 2.4.19.tar.bz2 and
    2.4.19-bastardized.tar.bz2 ?
4. Is this just for (a) removing redundant code after installation or
    (b) providing subset version(s) for download.
5. If 4(a) wouldn't you need to parse the .config to find the appropriate
    bits to remove?
Pádraig.
