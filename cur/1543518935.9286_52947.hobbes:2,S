Nope, it should definitely be

instead. "pg_off" has already been shifted down once.

Hmm.. For out-of-range values used at some point to return the old value
of brk(), not ENOMEM. Maybe that's the problem? Programs used to be able
to get their original brk-point by doing
	brk = brk(0)
and if it now returns -ENOMEM instead of the starting brk, then that would
explain the behaviour you see above (wrong brk from malloc - it uses
0x4000 instead of 0x84x... because it incorrectly thought that the old brk
value was at -1 + alignment).?
