In newer kernels only.  We still support 2.2.x kernels, and to find kernel version
you have to parse some kernel headers...  And unfortunately vermagic mismatch is
printed into `dmesg` only, so it takes several iterations until customer is able
to pinpoint problem down (to 586/686 mismatch, for example).
