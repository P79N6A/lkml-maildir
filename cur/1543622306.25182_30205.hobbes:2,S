Interresting. But do they still incorporate ST509 and other
archaic controllers? Or do they have broken BIOS-es which don't
setup the geometry information properly? I don't think so.
Well now I'm quite convinced. We can point those people to the legacy
single host driver anyway... And then the tradeoff goes just in favour
of supporting more and more common new hardware - it will just make
more people happy than it will make people loose :-).
