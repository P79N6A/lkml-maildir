           Summary: Floppy access locks system with endless stream of errors
    Kernel Version: 2.5.68-bk11
            Status: NEW
          Severity: high
             Owner: bugme-janitors@lists.osdl.org
         Submitter: bwindle-kbt@fint.org
Distribution: Debian Testing
Hardware Environment: Dell Optiplex GXa
Problem Description:
Trying to mount a floppy gives an endless stream of:
floppy0: disk absent or changed during operation
end_request: I/O error, dev fd0, sector 0
floppy0: disk absent or changed during operation
end_request: I/O error, dev fd0, sector 0
floppy0: disk absent or changed during operation
end_request: I/O error, dev fd0, sector 0
The system is non-responsive to changes to VTs, it can't be pinged, but 
alt+sysrq prints "SysRq: Show State" but never prints anything beyond that
(but  changing LogLevel via Sysrq works).
Ctrl+alt+delete has no effect, numlock won't turn on/off numlock light.
Steps to reproduce:
Insert floppy, try to mount it.
