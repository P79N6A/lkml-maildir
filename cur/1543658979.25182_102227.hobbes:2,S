Okay.  What will the hook do, BTW?  Just turn hardware rotation to
the appropriate orientation?  Something like...
int fb_rotate(struct fb_info *info, int rotate);
Then we can do something like:
if (info->fbops->fb_rotate) {
	info->fbops->fb_rotate(info, FB_ROTATE_CCW);
	"pass 'normally' oriented data"
else
	"pass data rotated CCW"
}
Also, you may want to place the rotate field in fb_fix_screeninfo
instead.  You mentioned that rotation is to be activated at the console
layer, so the rotate field is for informational purposes only.

Yeap.  Geert forwarded them to me.  Thanks Geert :-)
