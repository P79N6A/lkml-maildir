Why not make a flag that handles that choice explicitly.
If the task sets the affinity itself the default is to
re-affine it if the cpu gets yanked but if the task wants to
be suspended until the CPU reappears it can set a flag for
that to happen if the CPU is yanked.
If we have a program that can start another program on a
specific CPU then that program can dictate how the task
should respond by setting the flag the same way
as the task would if the task would be the one selecting
a specific CPU. Doesn't that fix the problem?
If the default was to re-affine to another CPU then
we can optionally send it a SIGPWR as well to let it
know it was re-affined.
But the SIGPWR is in my eyes optional and the above scenario
should handle the cases imo.
