Well, I did remove the tv-card - and today got a hard lockup. It's a VIA 
A7VI-VM motherboard with a 900MHz Duron, lapic explicitely re-enabled on 
the command-line:
Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=2.6.10 ro root=308 3 lapic nmi_watchdog=2 
console=tty1 console=ttyS0,38400
/proc/interrupts:
NMI:         59
and still it didn't trigger. Why? Going to get 2.6.11.latest now... Was 
2.6.10.
Thanks
Guennadi
