Hi,
And again, here's some more PCI changes against the latest 2.5.70 bk tree.
They contain the following:
	- removed the last of the usages of pci_present(), and the
	  pci_present() function.
	- added some __user markings to make sparse happy.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/pci-2.5
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.

  o PCI: sparse fixups for drivers/pci/proc.c
  o PCI: pci_present() can finally be removed, as there are no more users of it
