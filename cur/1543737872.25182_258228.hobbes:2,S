Confirmed.  As Andi says, sorting the exception table does fix the problem.  Tested 2.6.9-rc3 with gcc 3.3.3 and there are no issues.  My major malfunction was working on an older 2.6 kernel and believing the patches were still relevant.  Linus, please revert the following commit, it is no longer needed and do_test_wp_bit is better inlined into __init and subsequently discarded now that exceptions in __init work.
I've added a nicer patch that inlines the do_test_wp_bit function and deprecates the outdated comment.

#   i386: mark do_test_wp_bit() noinline
#   
#   As reported by Zachary Amsden <zach@vmware.com>,
#   some gcc versions will inline the function even when
#   it is declared after the call-site. This particular
#   function must not be inlined, since the exception
#   recovery doesn't like __init sections (which the caller
#   is in).
