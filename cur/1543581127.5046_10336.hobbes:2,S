The kernel makes you guess what the error messages are, to add some
spice to life :-)

ksymoops could not find the modules you loaded.  Did you rename, delete
or overwrite /lib/modules/2.4.2-pre1 between the oops and the time you
ran ksymoops?

ksymoops could could not find some modules, those it could find have
changed since the oops.  I would treat all your traces with suspicion,
the base data is very unreliable.  Try to reproduce with current
modules, instead of modules that have changed since the oops.
BTW, do not specify -O unless you have a good reason to ignore objects,
which you don't.  You should supply a system map with -m instead of
suppressing it with -M.
