It differs in that it has masks (view specifications), they scale well, 
their collection and specification is well automated, and they are 
attached to the process executable rather than in some centralized place 
(that is, they are process oriented not object oriented (traditional) 
and not centralized.  Users without root can use them and be trusted 
with the power to do so.
