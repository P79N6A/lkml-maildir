That's not the point. What you should tell me is that I can't reimplement
rmb() without a lock on the bus because the minium common divisor of a
spin_unlock() in pseudocode is not like in the Alpha implementation:
	mb();
	spinlock.lock = 0;
as I basically stated (I was thinking wrong) in my previous email.
On Alpha the spin_unlock can't be more finegrined because there's no way
you can _only_ avoid memory accesses before the barrier to be executed
after the barrier and letting accesses after the barrier to be executed
before the barrier.
I didn't understood well what IA32 enforces in a write: I thought the
write was enforcing order in both directions (up and down).

Not only the rmb() as it's common code (on i386 the rmb would be enough of
course). mb() is necessary instead.
BTW, In the example you provide below moving add_wait_queue in the middle
would remove the need of the barrier as an add_wait_queue executes both
the spin_lock and spin_unlock so it will sobstitute an mb() no matter how
the spin_lock/unlock are implemented.

Thanks.
