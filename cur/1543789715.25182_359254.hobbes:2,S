Thanks everyone for the feedback, will fix up the alignment.
A quick question on the use of u8 and u32 types in x25.h.
/usr/src/linux-2.6.13.4/include/linux/x25.h and 
/usr/include/linux/x25.h
have been identical between the kernel and glibc-kernheaders type
packages, using u8 and u32 would require extra changes to the userspace
version.
__u32 or unsigned int look to be the norm for other similar headers,
whats the recommended type of types to be used?
Thanks,
Andrew.
