I would guess Brasero is issuing a command with the length of data
wrongly set. In the old code that might well just produce errors of the
"Umm wtf is this data left over for ?", with the new code the drive is
likely to change state as it knows the transfer size and that will
*correctly* cause an HSM error and what follows.
Now the question is who gets the length wrong - Brasero or the ata
translation code in libata
