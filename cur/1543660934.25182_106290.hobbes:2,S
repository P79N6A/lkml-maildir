Hi,
I'm trying 2.4.21pre3aa1 kernel, it was running very well for 1 day,
but I'm now experiencing 'kernel: __alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed (gfp=0x21/0)' kind of errors.
It's a HIGHMEM kernel (compiled with gcc 3.2.2) with 1Go of RAM.
(i686 athlon xp arch)
I was using xmms with alsa-0.9.0rc6 when messages started. Since I haven't
been able to use alsa pcm devices nor oss ones. 
I'm available to give you more information and do some tests.
Regards
