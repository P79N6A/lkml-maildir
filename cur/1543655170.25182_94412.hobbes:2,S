I had this problem a while ago.  It turned out to be a (widespread)
BIOS bug triggered be the disk-size probe of the kernel's boot loader.
The crude fix which worked for me: disable the probing for 2.88MB disks
by changing the first byte of the disksizes table at the end of bootsect.S
from 36 to 18.
The long explanation: The BIOS allows bigger-than-track-size reads
in El-Torito mode which confuses the probe routine which then assumes
a 2.88MB disk when the BIOS is actually emulating a 1.44MB disk.
In LBA mode that would be no problem but in CHS mode (which is used
by the loader) it does not work.
Ciao, ET.
