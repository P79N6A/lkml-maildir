Good day.
commit 8779f2fc3b84ebb6c5181fb13d702e9944c16069
"x86: don't try to allocate from DMA zone at first"
breaks all of ISA DMA. Or all of ALSA ISA DMA at least. All
ISA soundcards are silent following that commit -- no error
messages, everything appears fine, just silence.
It won't just revert due to 32/64 merge.
Rene.
