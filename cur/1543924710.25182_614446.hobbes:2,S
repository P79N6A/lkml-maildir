I don't know enough about Kbuild to know if it's possible or not, but I
would find it great if the *config targets could take CONFIG_ variables
on the command line, like:
make oldconfig CONFIG_SMP=y
If it's not possible, why not inherit the CONFIG_ options from environment
variables, like we already do for $CFLAGS, but only at make *config
time in this case?
