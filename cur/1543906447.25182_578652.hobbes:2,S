Yeah, we need to get that finished off.
The current _design_ of the VM/VFS is such that if the application runs
fsync() or msync() then it will be able to reliably detect any data loss
which has occurred, even if that data loss occurred during a random pageout
attempt by some other process half an hour ago.
However Guillaume has identified some holes in the implementation (I don't
recall the details, but that link is a start).
