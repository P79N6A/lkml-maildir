Paul M - I never replied to your initial CONFIG_CPUSETS_LEGACY_API
patch proposal - sorry.
An aspect of this proposal never made sense to me, so I put it aside
and went on to other things.
It is important to me that the current cpuset API be maintained.  The
cpuset API seems to be working well, for a number of users.
Occassionally I will agree to subtle API changes (see another thread
concerning cpu_exclusive and sched_domain cpuset flags), but not
anything likely to break user code outright, except under duress.
But I presume this CONFIG_CPUSETS_LEGACY_API option means I either
get to build a kernel that supports the new container API, or a kernel
that supports the old cpuset API.  That does not seem useful to me.
We need to support both API's, at runtime, at the same time.  Not a choice
of API's at build time with a kernel CONFIG option.
Perhaps I am missing something ...
