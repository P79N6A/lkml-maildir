Thanks for extensive testing and report.
I didn't want to make a fuss about these O18 patches because I've been excited 
by changes previously that weren't as good as I first thought. 
My mistake after O15 was that my patches made priority inversion (always 
there) much much worse at times, and I went looking for a generic solution to 
priority inversion which has destroyed better coders than I. Instead I went 
looking for why it was much worse on O15+ and found two algorithm bugs. Much 
better to kill off bugs than hide them under the carpet. 
Furthermore it doesn't look like it's my fault for the drop in performance on 
big SMP after all which is good news.
