For kernel:  linux-2.3.47
lp.c is located in "/usr/src/linux"/drivers/char/
Bug is mostly cosmetic but can break some things.
A bug in lp.c was causing the devfs's device (printers/0) to be put into
root.  Whenever lp.o was loaded as a module or compiled into the kernel,
0 would show up in the root.
A simple fix is the included patch or just simply moving the function
devfs_mk_dir above parport_register_driver.  Parport_register_driver
somewhere calls devfs_register without devfs_handle being initialized to
the new directory, thus putting 0 into the root of /dev.
Thanks,
Stephen Marz
