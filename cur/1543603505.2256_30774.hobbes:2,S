Check the latest driver, it works with my IBM switch, and with other
EEPRO and Tulip NICs now, so it may work for you.  The DLINK 4-port
is actually the only one I know of that I have ever gotten to fully
function.  The ZYNX would kind of work at half-duplex for a while,
and an ancient Adaptec I tried locks the whole computer on insmod
of it's driver (IRQ routing issues someone guessed...)  There are
several 2-port EEPRO based NICs out there that work really well
too, but they are expensive...
