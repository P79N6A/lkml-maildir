Yes, I pointed him at you for 2.4test because you had the code sitting on
top of bootmem which is the right way to do it.

bigmem is 'last resort' stuff. I'd much rather it is as now a seperate
allocator so you actually have to sit and think and decide to give up on
kmalloc/vmalloc/better algorithms and only use it when the hardware sucks
