well, EEVDF is a paper-only academic scheduler, one out of thousands 
that never touched real hardware. For nearly every mathematically 
possible scheduling algorithm i suspect there's at least one paper out 
there already describing it ;-) But this time the EEVDF paper got it 
right and you got it wrong. But really, if you want to make an impact on 
how CFS looks like then please try it and send test feedback and/or 
patches - not words. =B-)
