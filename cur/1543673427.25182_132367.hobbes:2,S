Which ones are you thinking about in particular? I've developed most
of those fixes in parallel on 2.4.x and 2.5.x, and have tried to push
them to Linus asap. I therefore believe 2.5.x should be pretty much up
to date.
I believe Chuck has compiled a list of discrepancies, but IIRC there
are no showstoppers there.
The most serious non-NFSv4 problem I believe is the fact that IODirect
for NFS needs to be completed. I need to bug Chuck about that.
I also need to look over the VFS file locking changes to see if
anything has broken lockd.
any more?
Cheers,
  Trond
