Normally I use the ubuntu's kernel build commands : make-kpkg 
--revision=1  kernel_image kernel_headers
When I tried with "make bzImage" "make modules", everything went very 
smooth and it compiled successfully. It seems, some virtualization 
changes effected the ubuntu's kernel build process. Thank you very much 
for your help and pointing it, Jeremy.
