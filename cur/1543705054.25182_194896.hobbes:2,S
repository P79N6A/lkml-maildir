This patch updates the matching code to ensure that all requested devices are
present on the card, even if they are in use.  It is necessary for some ALSA
drivers to work properly because early vendors would have different sets of
devices on the same card ids.  It is from Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>.
