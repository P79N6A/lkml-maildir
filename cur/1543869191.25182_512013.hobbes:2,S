Sure, that's a fairly common approach.

You have fairly strict assumptions about the "Before:" picture.  But
what happens if those assumptions fail.  To give you an example, imagine
the following small script:
$ for i in `seq 1000000`; do touch $i; done
This will create a million dentries in one directory.  It will also
create a million inodes, but let us ignore those for a moment.  It is
fairly unlikely that you can fit a million dentries into [D0], so you
will need more than one block.  Let's call them [DA], [DB], [DC], etc.
So you have to write out the first block [DA].
 Before:
Segment 1: [some data] [ DA D1 D2 I ] [more data]
Segment 2: [             some data              ]
Segment 3: [               empty                ]
If the datablock D0 is modified, what you get is:
Segment 1: [some data] [  garbage   ] [more data]
Segment 2: [             some data              ]
Segment 3: [ DA D1 D2 I ] [       empty         ]
That is exactly your picture.  Fine.  Next you write [DB].
Before: see above
After:
Segment 1: [some data] [  garbage   ] [more data]
Segment 2: [             some data              ]
Segment 3: [ DA][garbage] [ DB D1 D2 I ] [ empty]
You write [DC].  Note that Segment 3 does not have enough space for
another partial segment:
Segment 1: [some data] [  garbage   ] [more data]
Segment 2: [             some data              ]
Segment 3: [ DA][garbage] [ DB][garbage] [wasted]
Segment 4: [ DC D1 D2 I ] [       empty         ]
You write [DD] and [DE]:
Segment 1: [some data] [  garbage   ] [more data]
Segment 2: [             some data              ]
Segment 3: [ DA][garbage] [ DB][garbage] [wasted]
Segment 4: [ DC][garbage] [ DD][garbage] [wasted]
Segment 5: [ DE D1 D2 I ] [       empty         ]
And some time later you even have to switch to a new indirect block, so
you get before:
Segment n  : [ DX D1 D2 I ] [       empty         ]
After:
Segment n  : [ DX D1][garb] [ DY DI D2 I ] [ empty]
What you end up with after all this is quite unlike you "Before"
picture.  Instead of this:
>  Segment 1: [some data] [ D0 D1 D2 I ] [more data]
You may have something closer to this:
> >Segment 1: [some data] [   D1  ] [more data]
> >Segment 2: [some data] [   D0  ] [more data]
> >Segment 3: [some data] [   D2  ] [more data]
You should try the testcase and look at a dump of your filesystem
afterwards.  I usually just read the raw device in a hex editor.
