I will most likely be purchasing a system soon which will make use of an
Adaptec Zero Channel raid card and so it will require the use of the
dpt_i2o Adaptec driver.  However, currently in 2.5.5 if you select
Adaptec i2o to be compiled it gives an error caused by this line:
#error Please convert me to Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt
Will this be fixed in a -pre version any time soon?  Thanks for any info
on the situation with this scsi driver.
