I don't see significant negative impact.
I consider it much worse that on several HP models fan control is messed
up (to at least kernel .21, after suspend fan is gone for sure, possibly
already before), there are also fan breakage reports for FSCs.
These are only the worst, really sever kind of bugs... 
I hope that bugs like e.g.:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7122
99 comments, already takes over half a year (still no working fan?)
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5534
211 comments, opened in Nov, final patches submitted in Feb 2007 - (ok
that was a tricky one with several patch approaches, still...)
end up with less question-answer posts and can be processed/solved much
faster.
Second point is to get more people on the boot, starting to work on
ACPI. People can identify bugs (kernel or BIOS misbehavior) by simply
understanding a bit ASL and by examining the debug output, no deep
kernel knowledge is really needed (unfortunately some people with deep
kernel knowledge don't want to touch ACPI parts at all, maybe some of
these guys then see that the interpreter itself isn't working that
bad...).
If we get bug reports like: My battery is not working, and I found out
that in line 42 of my DSDT a ACPI func returns a real strange value,
that's much more worth than 5, 10 or (IMO) even 100 ms of boot time.

I mean the ASL tables DSDT and SSDTs (not the enveloped, static once).
Vendor (or laptop model/series) specific ACPI devices are flying around.
Fortunately we got some support by the merged asus, thinkpad, toshiba
and sony ACPI drivers. But there is still a lot to improve and new
models come out every week... A big challenge could also be the move
from the proprietary ACPI to the video ACPI spec funcs...
Some define extra fan/temp control (these breaking with hwmon tools and
legacy i2c/smbus drivers) ACPI functions which we do not use. There are
WMI ACPI funcs and so on.
It's just a very rough guess, but I expect we make use of about 30-70
percent of the ACPI (AML) code provided by the BIOS (hard to guess which
are used or unused helper functions..). It's appreciated that Intel
helps to implement the spec stuff, but for full support more work and
more people working on it are needed...

Yes, it looks like a side effect, that on very short taking
measurements, the debug time increase is that much, but I don't know for
sure.
I'd have expected more time increase for the whole namespace parsing
where millions of function trace or other debug statements could get
checked, but this came out to be not that much (even much better without
function trace). So I doubt the time increase for the short time taking
measurements are true or it's for some reason only for short taking
functions. If I find some time I check that again on a bigger Itanium
with some ten thousand lines of ASL, if it's fast enough it should be
fine...

The only wanted changes are comments, right?
This could already be in your tree for three weeks.

Hm, who makes use of the store(xy, debug) functionality knows what he's
doing and should know where to enable it?

Good idea. But this does not work because you'd need a kind of curly
braces functionality for pre-processor conditionals.

Thanks,

Split ACPI_DEBUG function trace into its own compile option.
Function trace is most of the ACPI_DEBUG costs, but is
not much of use for kernel ACPI debugging.
Size of kernel image increased on test compile:
+ 48k  (Full ACPI_DEBUG)
+ 35k  (ACPI_DEBUG with function trace compiled out)
Performance without function trace is also much better.
Also remove ACPI_LV_DEBUG_OBJECT from default debug level as
a lot vendors let Store (value, debug) in their code and this
might confuse users when it pops up in syslog.
That means, if you make use of your own, overridden DSDT and
store things to the debug object, you need to explicitly add the
debug_object flag to the boot param acpi.debug_level=
or enable it at runtime in the corresponding /sys/ file.

Split ACPI_DEBUG function trace into its own compile option.
Function trace is most of the ACPI_DEBUG costs, but is
not much of use for kernel ACPI debugging.
Size of kernel image increased on test compile:
+ 48k  (Full ACPI_DEBUG)
+ 35k  (ACPI_DEBUG with function trace compiled out)
Performance without function trace is also much better.
Also remove ACPI_LV_DEBUG_OBJECT from default debug level as
a lot vendors let Store (value, debug) in their code and this
might confuse users when it pops up in syslog.
If you make use of your own, overridden DSDT and store things
to the debug object, you need to explicitly add the
debug_object flag to the boot param acpi.debug_level=
or enable it at runtime in the corresponding /sys/ file.
