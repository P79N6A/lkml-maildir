NAK.
a. Please make the patch available for x86-64 as well as x86.  The two
are coupled enough that they need to agree.
b. This patch will override a user-provided command line if one
exists.  This is the wrong behaviour; instead, the builtin command
line should only apply if no user-specified command line is present.
