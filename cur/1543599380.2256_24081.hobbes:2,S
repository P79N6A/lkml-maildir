Certainly (I seem to recall composing a comment to that effect
recently :-)!  Sorry for being unclear, I meant that those tests
in lookup_swap_cache() are made without the page being locked
by lookup_swap_cache() or its caller (and I'm not proposing
that the page should be locked, but the unsafe tests removed).
