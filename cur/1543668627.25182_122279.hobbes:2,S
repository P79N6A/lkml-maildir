Of course. But because of James decided that fbdev layer will automatically
choose appropriate resolution only from xres/yres, I need to have monitor
capabilities at the time upper layer asks to set videomode on /dev/fbx...
And it just sets it on /dev/fbx, leaving out both VTs (so I cannot remember
what mode was probed on each VT anymore) and outputs.
