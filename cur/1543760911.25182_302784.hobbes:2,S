However the vsyscall/fsyscall bits cannot call in-kernel functions (as
they execute in userspace or a sudo-userspace). As it stands now in my
design TIMESOURCE_FUNCTION timesources will not be usable for
vsyscall/fsyscall implementations, so I'm not sure if that's doable.
I'd be interested you've got a way around that.
