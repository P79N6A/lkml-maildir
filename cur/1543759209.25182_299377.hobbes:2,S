FWIW, there is a similar, perhaps enough to be related, BugMe bug
(#4269): 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4269
I had contacted Gerd Knorr (who I've CC'ed this mail to, to bring it
to his attention, as well as Michael Hunold) about the issue (as noted
in the BugMe entry) and he said he had patches setup for 2.6.12.
Gerd, would your patches fix these errors as well?
Thanks,
Nish
