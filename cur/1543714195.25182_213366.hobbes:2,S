We can try a few fancy locking tricks. But, we don't know whether
such tricks will help.

Yeap. With prio_tree it is tricky. We already have the marker for
prio_tree, i.e., prio_tree_iter. But, when you drop a lock new tree
nodes may be added to the prio_tree, and the marker does not provide
any consistent meaning after the node additions.
