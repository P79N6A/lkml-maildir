Well 'init' was supposed to be the process group leader by default.
however, here is a trace with setsid() just to "make sure".

I think I remember, that there was a discussion several years ago that
"The first N processes are supposed to be special...." so there may
be something bogus keeping them from having a controlling terminal.
Like they may be "marked" as having a controlling terminal, but they
don't really have one. This would cause tiocsctty() to return -EPERM
(line 1553 in tty_io.c).
I will make another experiment and attempt to release any 'controlling
terminal' before I make the call again.
Cheers,
