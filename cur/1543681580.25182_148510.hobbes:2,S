Hi all...
After some binary search and a 'couple' kernel builds, I narrowed the
problem to mm/memory.c. With that file built at -O1:
CFLAGS_memory.o = -O1
The kernel boots, starts /sbin/init and looks like working normally
(2.4.22-pre5).
Anybody can see what is miscompiled with an assembler listing ?
Any #pragma to switch optmizations on the half of a file or for
a function ?
TIA
