Subject: a quick survey:  "FIELD_SIZEOF" or "MEMBER_SIZE"?

  pardon the interruption but, once upon a time, we were discussing
cleaning up code to use the kernel.h-defined macro "FIELD_SIZEOF".
  some folks suggested that the macro name itself was kind of awkward
as it didn't fit the pattern of "ARRAY_SIZE" defined in that same
header file.
  because of a name clash, "FIELD_SIZE" is not available, but there
was a suggestion of, uh, "MEMBER_SIZE".  :-)
  so, really, those are the two viable choices -- stick with the
current name of FIELD_SIZEOF, or switch to MEMBER_SIZE.  switching is
not a big deal since no one (at least, no one in the current tree)
uses FIELD_SIZEOF as it is, so it's not as if it would be a disruptive
change in the slightest.
  opinions?
