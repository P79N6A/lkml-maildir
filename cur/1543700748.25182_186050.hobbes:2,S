This is a raid1 bug.
Some block devices have limits on the sizes of io requests that they
can handle, and advertise these limits with ->max_sectors and
->merge_bvec_fn (and a few others).  Any device MUST be able to accept
a single page IO at any offset.
When raid1 does a 'resync' it does all IO in 64K requests, ignoring
the restrictions.
Getting raid1 resync to handle the restrictions is non-trivial (I have
code, but it is still buggy).
A simple interim fix is to replace
#define RESYNC_BLOCK_SIZE (64*1024)
with
#define RESYNC_BLOCK_SIZE PAGE_SIZE
