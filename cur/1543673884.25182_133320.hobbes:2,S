Certainly the great effort some vendors put in making the kernel small
doesn't belong in the main kernel. But things which can relatively be made
optional, and I think that means futex, could. I like the idea of a tiny
kernel menu, with some painful detail about what happens if you remove a
feature. In many cases "breaks glibc" isn't an issue.

Clearly the call is yours, but if all the optional features with
capability impact are in a single menu, as proposed, then you avoid
having people mess up by doing the removal by hand.
Making it easier to use Linux for small applications seems like a good
thing, although I admit that's an activist rather than a technical point
of view.

I would say that having it on a "tiny Linux" menu, labeled dangerous,
with an explanatory help message is less likely to cause trouble than
letting people view it as "an undocmented Linux config option to make
the kernel smaller and faster."
If you know what you will break it's less likely to be a surprise.
