Not to dispute your conclusions or method, but I think doing a
defconfig or your personal config might be more representative
of % size increase of text that will actually be executed. And
that is the expensive type of text.
eg. core code may contain many more instances of checks that
cannot be optimised away, meaning it may be a more significant
cache footprint increase than the 0.05% increase in your test.
Of course, it is equally possible that the instances in core
code do not represent often-executed code, so it is a bit of a
fudge either way.
