Sorry, but this set off my hyperbole detector.  Ever hear of a VST
plugin?  On Linux, people do realtime DSP stuff with JACK in user space
all the time that (no offense) makes a soft modem look like a toy in
comparison, like process 32 channels of 24 bit audio at 96KHz through a
reverb, amp modelers, equalizers, pitch correction, etc.

On a recent kernel you don't even need to be root to get reliable RT
scheduling ;-)
