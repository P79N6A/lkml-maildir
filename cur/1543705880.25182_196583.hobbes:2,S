Hi,
did anybody done some benchmarking of kernel speed according to selected CPU? What I mean - if I have let's say P4, Athlon & VIA C3 and I compile kernel for generic Pentium class or compile it for each CPU separately what can be perfomance hit? 1%? 20%? 100%? ;) I know that it heavily depends on how much I spent in user/kernel space and usage (desktop/file server/database/...)
Thanks,
Libor
