FWIW, here's another data point:
When I suffered the filesystem corruption, I had also been seeing a
repeatable devfs problem.  I had reported the problem to Richard who was
unable to reproduce it.
After I got my /usr partition put back together, I did "make clean; make
bzImage modules modules_install" and installed the new kernel. At that
point, I was still using egcs 2.91.66. The devfs problem went away and I
ran without corruption for several days until at Linus's suggestion, I
dropped back to gcc 2.7.2.3.
Yesterday, I built a new kernel which failed to boot. Again, "make
clean; make bzImage" produced a working kernel. I had kept the
non-bootable kernel around and noticed that it was significantly larger
than the one that worked.
In both instances (FS corruption/devfs-wierdness and unbootable kernel),
I had been changing the modularization of the kernel. In the first
instance (FS corruption/devfs), I had been moving drivers between kernel
and modules. In yesterday's case, I changed from a modularized kernel to
a monolithic one.
Except for these two cases, 2.2.10 has been solid. It has also been
solid on my server  (SMP, AIC7xxx) where I almost never change the
kernel configuration.
