I'm not quite sure, what problem you're trying to solve here. NLS is used 
to convert from a local encoding to unicode, HFS has only 8bit 
characters, so there isn't much space to store the unicode characters in. 
If you want to use utf-8, you can do so without changing hfs. All 
filesystem which don't use nls (that includes e.g. ext3) store the 
filename in the local encoding.
If you want to store unicode characters use HFS+, I plan to implement nls 
support real soon for it (especially because to also fix the missing 
decomposition support). 
bye, Roman
