For me the PPP performance has gotten much better.  I just upgraded my
PPro-166 to RedHat 5.2 and 2.2.1 kernel.  I _never_ got transfer rates like
this before upgrading (was using 5.1 based system with latest dev kernels).  I
used to get maybe 28-31 Kbs.  Now I get 40+ Kbs. almost all the time.  This is
a Motorola Modem Surf'r 56Flex modem.  This is UP, 96Mb RAM, PPP as module,
all tools upgraded to recommended. M/B is ASUS P6NP5.
