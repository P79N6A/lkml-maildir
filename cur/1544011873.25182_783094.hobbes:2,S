Could you please
- make sure whether usbhid is used on 2.6.27 to drive the mouse and 
  usbmouse on 2.6.28-rc with the exact same mouse? (either check 
  /sys/bus/usb/devices or even lsusb shouldn't ideally show usbmouse 
  loaded at all)
- if so, make sure that you really need to build usbmouse (please read the 
  help text in Kconfig for explanation)

Really, please read the help text.
Maybe we should make it dependent on EMBEDDED.
