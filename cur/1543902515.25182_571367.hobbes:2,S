Actually, even with a 64K dictionary size (for which point the
decompression runtime memory requirements are comparable to gzip) LZMA
beats both gzip -9 and bzip2 -9 quite handily:
Reference (this is an i386 kernel):
-rwxrwxr-x 1 hpa hpa 5607558 Jul 18 15:04 vmlinux.bin*
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hpa hpa 2658275 Jul 18 15:04 vmlinux.bin.bz2
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hpa hpa 2760849 Jul 18 15:04 vmlinux.bin.gz
Pure LZMA with dictionary sizes from 2^16 to 2^24:
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hpa hpa 2380983 Jul 18 15:14 d16.7z
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hpa hpa 2317458 Jul 18 15:15 d18.7z
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hpa hpa 2284746 Jul 18 15:15 d20.7z
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hpa hpa 2264001 Jul 18 15:15 d22.7z
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hpa hpa 2263185 Jul 18 15:15 d24.7z
LZMA with BCJ precompression:
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hpa hpa 2236070 Jul 18 15:14 d16bcj.7z
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hpa hpa 2167873 Jul 18 15:15 d18bcj.7z
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hpa hpa 2134541 Jul 18 15:15 d20bcj.7z

Most likely.

Agreed, especially given the invasiveness of the patch.
