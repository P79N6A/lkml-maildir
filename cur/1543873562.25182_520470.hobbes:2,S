It sounds like people are happy with the fix suggested by Nick.  That fix 
is okay with me as it fixes the problem I am having.
I suspect, however, that by not directly detecting the problematic access 
pattern, where the file is accessed sequentially in small hunks, other 
applications may experience performance problems related to caching. For 
example, if an application frequently and non-sequentially reads from the 
same page.  This is especially true for files of size < PAGE_CACHE_SIZE.
But, I'm not sure if such an access pattern likely.
