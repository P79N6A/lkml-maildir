The current solution doesn't hit the performance at all when compared to
the competitor POSIX-compliant systems. It is faster and does even more
than the POSIX standard requires.
Please see the test results I've sent into the thread "-v6 0/2":
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/18/447
I guess, the current solution is ready to use.
