oic.  "and hold the lock across the callback".
Is the ranking of pci_bus_sem and dev->dev.sem correct+consistent?  It
looks OK.
It might be worth making a not that the callback function cannot call any
PCI layer function which takes pci_bus_sem - that'll casue a recursive
down_read(), which is a nasty source of rare deadlocks.
