Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Add dev_sysdata and use it for ACPI
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

As discussed on linux PCI, these 2 patches:
 - Add a dev_sysdata structure to struct device whose content is arch
specific. It will allow architectures like powerpc, arm, i386, ... who
need different types of DMA ops for busses and other kind of auxilliary
data for devices in general (numa node id, firmware data, etc...) to put
them in there, without bloating all architectures. The patch adds an
empty definition for the structure to all architectures.
 - As an example (patch test built but not test booted), I removed ACPI
usage of device->firmware_data, removed the firmware_data field
completely from struct device (as it was, apparently, the only user),
and instead used an "acpi_handle" field in x86 and x86_64 dev_sysdata.
I'd like to adapt my pending 2.6.20 patch set to use that instead of my
current "device_ext" thingy I've been doing, but that would mean having
an ack from Greg to merge the first patch in 2.6.20. Thus I'd like
feedback asap. The second patch is less critial, though Len is free to
take it and do whatever he wants with it :-)
Cheers,
Ben.
