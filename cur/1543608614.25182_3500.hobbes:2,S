Hello,
After about 40 hours 2.4.14-pre7-xfs (Nov 3 chekout) locked up (I think - no SysRQ
response) leaving in klogs what's below:
Nov  5 12:00:20 main kernel: KERNEL: assertion (sk->pprev==NULL) failed at tcp_ipv4.c(345):__tcp_v4_hash
I believe, that it's related to -pre6 David Miller's net updates.
Now I downgraded to 2.4.10-xfs, which I had been running more successfully
then 2.4.14-pre7 but not flawlessly...

Any hints ?
Cheers,
Krzysztof
