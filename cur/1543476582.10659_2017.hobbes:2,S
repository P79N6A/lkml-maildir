Do I need to reconfigure something?  I have ppp compiled in as Y, and I'm
running ppp 2.3.5-1.  My /var/log/messages shows the pppd restarting every
mintue with a new pid after I'm connected to my ISP.  Also it seems I'm
missing some modules (bsd compression?).  I tried my script to ifdown
ppp0, then killall -9 pppd to logoff my session and it wouldn't unlock
the modem.  I then tried deleting the lock file ( the pid did not exist )
and echo "atd" > /dev/modem.  I finally got it to hang up by running ifup
ppp0 agian.  After that I couldn't even get pppd to reconnect by running
it by hand ( /usr/sbin/pppd /dev/modem ...).
I rebooted and unlocked the modem, now every time I ifdown ppp0 it
seems to lock the modem down.  I never had this problem in 2.0.36, and I'm
guessing it has something to do with a bad kernel config.  I had the exact
same setup on 2.2.0-pre4, except I added the snes joystick driver as a
module.  My logs are getting really big, like I said  it writes the
respawing messages every minute for pppd.
