please see my previous codepath description. No spin_lock() calls in the 
measured codepath. They would show up in the latency trace anyway.

yeah. But then again - PIO ops easily take 16 usecs on almost arbitrary 
PC hardware, so an SMM trap might not be all that noticeable - 
especially if this register is considered legacy. (maybe Windows does 
the MMIO variant)
