That's probably one way of doing it.

No problem.  You could probably convince the user to do a tmpfs backup before 
an upgrade.

I think that's understood.  But this risk could be reduced by instantiating 
the latest sync'd mmap/swap.

Don't know what you mean here.  Do you mean that tmpfs performance is 
dependent on free swap-space being larger than some threshold.  If so, what 
threshold causes a tmpfs slowdown?

That's exactly what I want to avoid, as this would introduce a performance 
penalty.
All we need is a periodically synced tmpfs to mmap, with a minimal stream 
into page-cache algo on mount.
Thanks!
