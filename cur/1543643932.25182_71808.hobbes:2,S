I'll maintain this patch for myself if no one else, so I will not
go away.  But, since I am new to this code, and do not have a test
setup to test the ipv6 changes, I was hesitant.  I can at the least
patch it how I think it should be and test that ipv4 still works and
it compiles.  If you or someone else can do more profound testing on
it, then that would be great.

Would you object to me just removing all of them and having the patch
unconditionally compiled in?

Ok, I'll work up a patch with the ipv6 support and try to get that
out sometime next week.
Thanks,
