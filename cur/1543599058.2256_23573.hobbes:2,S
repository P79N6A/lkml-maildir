Read "available" as "onboard".
Before you use onboard resources you should know what it is !
Surely you don't want to place a PCI ioport window over unknown ports
(as this is what yenta did).

These ports are not nice here and should not be user by the irq handler:
   	PNP0c02 Motherboard resources
        io 0x0290-0x0297

The BIOS setup uses PNPBIOS to pass parameters to Linux :-)

This is a necessary interface to prevent (nearly undebuggable) linux hard hangs !
However, Gerd's debugging forces and his new patch already solve this thread
by giving a working solution.
