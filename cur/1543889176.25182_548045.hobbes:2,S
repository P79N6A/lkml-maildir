I forgot to mention that I have Ingo cfs patch in. But I had the same
behaviour without, so I do not think it's related.
root@rukbat:/sys/power# dmesg | grep clock
[   19.600060] Time: tsc clocksource has been installed.
[   23.028323] Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed.
The "time do not advance was an error of my side... I was basing myself
on the timestamp on the syslog, but then realized that this has nothig
to do with the time at which te message is sent. 
Will try to reboot with clocksource=acpi_pm, althoughI think that this
is the one I'm using.

By the way, suspend to disk (ehem... snapshot/restart) is busted too
(and yes, I have done the echo shutdown > /sys/power/disk thing, he
machine resumes but X no...worked like a charm in 2.6.17.13).
