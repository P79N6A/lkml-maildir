Shared mappings are represented in /proc/<pid>/maps file as having 's'
as its last permission field like r-xs (shared readable and executable
region)
But in this case, the perm bits are r--p which says that it is private
rather than shared. Any idea whatz happening here...?

> This seems like a huge requirement of memory for each small process
executed in the RH3.0 system and hence, shots up the memory requirement
of the entire system because the mapped region
/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive is privately mapped.
There is no RH 3.0 for AMD64 - if you mean RHEL 3 then the mappings are
shared between processes.
