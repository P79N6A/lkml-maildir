Ah, okay. I was under the impression that they should only be shown whenever 
there was an actual 'state' change, like battery is flat, is being charged, 
power is unplugged, not for the change of the charge level itself.

There is indeed klaptopdaemon running which does monitoring of the battery 
levens.

I have no idea anymore when it started, but it wasn't there on a certain 
earlier kernel - but then i'm talking pre 2.6.7 era. I just didn't bother 
reporting it earlier, since I attributed it to a faulty dsdt line or so. I've 
read that ACER laptops have their share of bad dsdt's, that's why I didn't 
really bother - it works, it's just a tad annoying.

Yups, charge levels :)
Thanks,
