Subject: [PATCH][RFC] request_modalias: MODALIAS based module loading
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/18/308

Ok, so here finally goes:
The following adds a new function called request_modalias to
lib/kobject_uevent.c and makes the kobject hotplug function call it
whenever it gets called in response of an addition.
Warning: The following also contains perhaps the worst abuse of strcmp
ever to be recorded in the history of public mailinglists, so beware!!!
This is the kind of stuff that has the potential for making pretty much
anyone with only even the slightest hint of technical good taste,
myself included, quickly rush for their b-p-b with a horrid expression
on their faces and a thought on their minds about what's becomming of
the world.
On the other hand it also made the patch so nonintrusive that, for a
proof-of-consept kind of thing, I just couldn't resist it. It also has
the added benefit of making the various subsystems virtually "plug and
play": As soon as they start exporting MODALIAS to the hotplug
enviroment request_module will also, if activated, start requesting
modules for them.
Let's hope I'm not prematurely ending the lives of too many brave brown
paper bags out there.
