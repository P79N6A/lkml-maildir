600 downloads a month may seem like a lot to you for one driver.
But think about how many people are running distribution kernels
rather than kernels they built themselves.  Typically none of
these people will even know your driver exists, let alone go
running after it to download/build it.
From an end-user perspective, out of tree drivers are a nuisance.
Time and time again, I get bug reports from users claiming
some bug is in the kernel, where the problem is actually that
they're running some out of tree driver that hasn't been 
updated to run on the latest kernels.
It's really in everyones (including yours) best interests
to get drivers merged into mainline.
