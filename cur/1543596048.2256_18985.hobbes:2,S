The mismatch and the weird entries in the trace imply that you ran
ksymoops with a different set of modules from the failing system.  This
is a common problem when decoding an oops after a reboot, the current
set of modules does not match the set at the time of failure so
ksymoops gets bad data.
The easiest fix is to follow the procedure in 'man insmod', section
KSYMOOPS ASSISTANCE.  Create directory /var/log/ksymoops, reproduce the
problem then decode the oops giving ksymoops the relevant ksyms.<date>
and modules.<date> files.  That way you guarantee that you are decoding
the oops using the correct set of symbols.  When you have a clean
decode, mail it to linux-kernel.
