Yes, it's fine with me.

Zero-initializations can be stripped.  (And lines seem still too long
:)

Missing static?  Also there are many global functions around here.

An incorrect information.  ALSA native mixers can use any value ranges
while OSS mixers require 0-100 range.

What is the reason to use __ prefix?
Don't use snd_xxx_t typedefs any more.  They are obsolete (and will be
removed in 2.6.20 tree).
Also, the line is too long (ditto for other callbacks).

'}' ane else should be in the same line.

I don't think this comment is correct...

The put callback is supposed to return the following values:
0 = the value isn't changed
1 = the value is changed
netagive value = error
The return of 1 is not strictly needed in practice, but it's better to
behave in a correct manner.

Better to use gfp_any() here, too?
(Or is it really too big for stack?)

Do they need to be exported?  I see them only in a single file as
callbacks...
Thanks,
