FWIW, I have the v1.1 GA-7VRXP using an Athlon XP 1800+ CPU and a GeForce3 
Ti200, and all has so far been well. Don't know if I'm just lucky. No CPU 
freq or voltage tweaks applied AFAICR.
The 20276 has been working fine controlling 2 of 4 disks of a software-RAID 
(i.e.  md, not ataraid) volume. No problems so far, other than a driver clash 
with an older Promise board: the BIOS for the MB wouldn't run with the old 
card enabled. Fixed by swapping the old board out.
