Am I mistaken or did this patch never make it into the kernel?
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0409.2/0902.html
I had to apply that patch a short while ago to 2.6.12.4 to fix kernel
crashes with some web servers at my previous place of employment.
Just now getting around to following up on why it seemed to be left
behind.
