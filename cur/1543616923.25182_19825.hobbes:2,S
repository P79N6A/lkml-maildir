Any big reason why you aren't including those two? I'm pretty sure a lot of
people will eventual bug Marcelo (and you) about merging ide to 2.4
proper (or -ac)... :)

So I gather you find this better than AA vm, even the -aa version?

With 17rc1, es1370 went once or twice to a state where it kept accepting
data _very_ slowly and seemingly nothing came out of speakers. Actually I'm
not sure if it actually ate any data, echo > /dev/dsp blocked, but some
audio apps _seemed_ to make some progress.
rmmod es1370; insmod es1370 succeeded, but didn't help - I had to reboot.
2.4.10ac10 (which is what I ran before 17rc1) never showed this. I wan't
able to reproduce it on purpose.
I guess this is not the fix for that?
