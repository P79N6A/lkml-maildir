How can you make /dev/urandom return something without leaking
information about the internal pool state to the observer?
Do you plan to switch to a completely different source and reseed the
PRNG with data not taken from the pool?
I don't understand what you mean with the "1/2 pool size": the pool 
size is always the same (once you set sys.kernel.random.poolsize),
it's just that the pool is somewhat known to the external observer.
The random bits you return to userspace either are related to the
internal pool (and thus leak knowledge about it) or not. Tertium non
datur. Or am I missing something?
I believe your 1/2 idea it's better implemented having two different
(and separated) pools: you can make /dev/urandom drain one but not the
other. /dev/random can drain one or both, it's just an implementation
choice.
In my experience, there's little you can do when the entropy demand is
higher than the rate at which the kernel collects it. Either we implement
/dev/random quotas, or it will be always easy to drain the internal pool
from userspace.
I'd say that /dev/urandom interface is somewhat broken: the application
either can live with an almost pure PRNG (and use an userspace
implementation) or needs true, pure and strong randomness. The programmer
should know the mimimal need for true randomness of the application.
For every application that uses /dev/urandom, it's 0 by definition of
/dev/urandom, and the application should just use an userspace PRNG.
If you need a weak solution (a perturbated PRNG), just read a few bits
from /dev/random at times (but in a controlled and defined way).
IMHO, the whole urandom thing should be extended and put into a
userspace library.
