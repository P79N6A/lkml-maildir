In a live system (actually, it's idle, but every 5 s, there is a short
burst of disk activity -- reiserfs and ext3fs in use here, something is
going on there), sg_dd is not really better than plain dd:

gives: 27,56 MB/s. A little better than dd, but still much less than FreeBSD's.

It does. I trust my last figures. I don't trust the above too much
because of the bogus 5 s interval write burst. Not sure where it comes
from, ext3fs or reiserfs, I'd pretty much like something like an inverse
strace: "who is writing to my disk?"

I know that, and I assume it's not the fault of the drivers themselves
(that's because the "far from theoretical optimum" holds on either
hardware).
Looks like either you're lucky or like Linux has some bad VM interaction
or Linux has issues with U160-drives on UWSCSI adapters (yours does
U160, ours don't) that FreeBSD doesn't have. (FreeBSD's IDE driver is
not as good as the Linux 2.5 IDE driver, so in the end, FreeBSD and
Linux are even again ;-)
