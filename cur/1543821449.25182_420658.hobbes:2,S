I wasn't talking about modifying gcc to do the checking, rather using 
language features so that the checks would happen during a regular 
compile. That would mean we weren't dependent on somebody running sparse 
with a configuration that triggers the bug, but those few who compile 
the code before submitting the patch would get it automatically checked.
