I don't know pagebuf well enough to understand if it can helps. However
I have a possible solution (not that it looks like to me that there are
many other possible solutions btw ;).
What worries me a bit is that whatever we do to improve swapin seeks it
can always disagree with what the lru says that have to be thrown away.
A dumb way to provide the current swapin-contiguous behaviour is to do a
unmap/swap-around of the pages pointed by the pagetables slots near the
one that we found in the lru.
I guess we could left a sysctl so that we can select between
swapin-optimized or lru-optimized behaviour at runtime to handy bench.
