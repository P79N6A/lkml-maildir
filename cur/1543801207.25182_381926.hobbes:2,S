except looking at the oopses, there's no obvious pattern amongst
the modules loaded.  Though they could all have a commonality as
a built-in driver, it's a long-shot.
even looking at the Fedora ones alone, which have no built-in
drivers, there's nothing that immediately jumps out like
"ooh, radeon again".  I'll look through them again tomorrow,
but first, sleep.
