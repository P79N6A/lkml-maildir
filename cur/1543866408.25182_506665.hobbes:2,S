Yes. The program which caused trouble works fine.
I used 'numademo' command in numactl package.
It works fine (reports -EINVAL) with this patch now.
I uses this a system with an empty-node for 5 months.
reported 2 bugs.
- oom-kill's memory less node detection logic.
- mempolicy's NULL access(this)
It works fine in general.
(old RHEL4/linux-2.6.9 kernel doesn't boot on this system.)
