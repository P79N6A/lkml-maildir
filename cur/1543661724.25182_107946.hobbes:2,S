It might, but please understand this.  The qlogicisp driver does things to
the scsi mid layer that the scsi mid layer does not protect itself against
and as a result is the biggest pile of steaming, unsupportable, crap code
in the universe!  The scsi mid layer was designed from day one to think
that the host->can_queue, sdev->queue_depth, and host->sg_tablesize items
were *static* on a given host/device unless specifically changed by
calling into the adjustment routines (scsi_adjust_queue_depth).  The
qlogicisp driver violates those principles and I make no warranty of any
kind that said driver will continue to operate properly unless someone
takes the time to actually audit the qlogicisp_queuecommand() and
qlogicisp_irq() routine to make sure it is actually doing the right thing
when making those changes!
If I understand correctly, Matthew Jacob's latest isp driver set drives
*all* qlogic hardware (or at least all the older stuff like the qlogicisp
driver drives).  I would much prefer that people simply test out Matthew's
driver and use it instead.  In fact, if it's ready for 2.5 kernel use, I
would strongly recommend that it be considered as a possible replacement
in the linux kernel for the default driver on all qlogic cards not handled
by the new qla2x00 driver version 6 (DaveM may have objections to that 
related to sparc if Matthew's driver isn't sparc friendly, but I don't 
know of any other reason not to switch over).
