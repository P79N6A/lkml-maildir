I am using an, IBM PS/2.
When I try to compile (2.3.x) for MCA, the build fails with an undefined 
reference to resource-fixup which I can only be found in PCI code. I kludged 
around that by copying the function from pci-i386.c into mca.c. The source 
compiled successfully and I am using it now. I dont know much about the kernel 
sources so I cannot submit a fix. What is that function for? Can anyone give 
me a hint so that I could fix it?
