+/*
+ * Immediate Value - i386 architecture specific code.
+ *
+ * Rationale
+ *
+ * Required because of :
+ * - Erratum 49 fix for Intel PIII.
+ * - Still present on newer processors : Intel Core 2 Duo Processor for Intel
+ *   Centrino Duo Processor Technology Specification Update, AH33.
+ *   Unsynchronized Cross-Modifying Code Operations Can Cause Unexpected
+ *   Instruction Execution Results.
+ *
+ * Permits immediate value modification by XMC with correct serialization.
+ *
+ * Reentrant for NMI and trap handler instrumentation. Permits XMC to a
+ * location that has preemption enabled because it involves no temporary or
+ * reused data structure.
+ *
+ * Quoting Richard J Moore, source of the information motivating this
+ * implementation which differs from the one proposed by Intel which is not
+ * suitable for kernel context (does not support NMI and would require disabling
+ * interrupts on every CPU for a long period) :
+ *
+ * "There is another issue to consider when looking into using probes other
+ * then int3:
+ *
+ * Intel erratum 54 - Unsynchronized Cross-modifying code - refers to the
+ * practice of modifying code on one processor where another has prefetched
+ * the unmodified version of the code. Intel states that unpredictable general
+ * protection faults may result if a synchronizing instruction (iret, int,
+ * int3, cpuid, etc ) is not executed on the second processor before it
+ * executes the pre-fetched out-of-date copy of the instruction.
+ *
+ * When we became aware of this I had a long discussion with Intel's
+ * microarchitecture guys. It turns out that the reason for this erratum
+ * (which incidentally Intel does not intend to fix) is because the trace
+ * cache - the stream of micorops resulting from instruction interpretation -
+ * cannot guaranteed to be valid. Reading between the lines I assume this
+ * issue arises because of optimization done in the trace cache, where it is
+ * no longer possible to identify the original instruction boundaries. If the
+ * CPU discoverers that the trace cache has been invalidated because of
+ * unsynchronized cross-modification then instruction execution will be
+ * aborted with a GPF. Further discussion with Intel revealed that replacing
+ * the first opcode byte with an int3 would not be subject to this erratum.
+ *
+ * So, is cmpxchg reliable? One has to guarantee more than mere atomicity."
+ *
+ * Overall design
+ *
+ * The algorithm proposed by Intel applies not so well in kernel context: it
+ * would imply disabling interrupts and looping on every CPUs while modifying
+ * the code and would not support instrumentation of code called from interrupt
+ * sources that cannot be disabled.
+ *
+ * Therefore, we use a different algorithm to respect Intel's erratum (see the
+ * quoted discussion above). We make sure that no CPU sees an out-of-date copy
+ * of a pre-fetched instruction by 1 - using a breakpoint, which skips the
+ * instruction that is going to be modified, 2 - issuing an IPI to every CPU to
+ * execute a sync_core(), to make sure that even when the breakpoint is removed,
+ * no cpu could possibly still have the out-of-date copy of the instruction,
+ * modify the now unused 2nd byte of the instruction, and then put back the
+ * original 1st byte of the instruction.
+ *
+ * It has exactly the same intent as the algorithm proposed by Intel, but
+ * it has less side-effects, scales better and supports NMI, SMI and MCE.
