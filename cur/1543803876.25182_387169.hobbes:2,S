It is not 100% accurate as in we lose time accounting for one clock tick
for the task_struct->utime, stime counters.  But
task_struct->signal->utime,stime collect rusage times of an exiting thread,
so we would be introducing large inaccuracies if we don't use rmb here.
Take the case when an exiting thread has a large utime stime value, and
rusage reports utime before thread exit and stime after thread exit... the
result would look wierd.
So IMHO, while inaccuracies in task_struct->xxx time can be tolerated, it
might not be such a good idea to for task_struct->signal->xxx counters.
Thanks,
Kiran
