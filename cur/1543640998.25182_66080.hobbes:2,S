Well, the idea is to
 - scan the kernel messages for things that got loaded
 - figure the hardware configuration
 - figure out guessable optimizations
 - use the default values for the rest
I don't want to decide between "y" and "n". That would go wrong. The only 
thing is that there *should* be a decision on whether the support is vital 
for boot or not, if not we compile as module.
This statement is not valid for debug options, though...

I wonder whether that's a good thing...
