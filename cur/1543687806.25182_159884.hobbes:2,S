These functions differ only in:
struct XXX *encoder = i2c_get_clientdata(client);
       ^^^
[...]
                        do {
                                block_data[msg.len++] =
                                    encoder->reg[reg++] = data[1];
                                    ^^^^^^^^^ 
[...]
                        if ((ret =
                             XXX_write(client, reg, *data++)) < 0)
                             ^^^^^^^^^
Make i2c_get_clientdata() return a generic container struct which
provides instance specific methods to retrieve the "reg" member and
the XXX_write() function. Init these in XXX_detect_client() just
before i2c_set_clientdata() and it is done.

Your choice. As a maintainer, you can say "It would be great. Volunteer
anyone ?" and see voluteer appearing.

Ok, I'll check 
http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net/driver-zoran/development.php
 and
try to kill one or two simple, self-contained, tasks.
[part-time kernel involvement]
Same thing here.
