Agreed if you add the polling cardbus bit.
Note polling cardbus would require more changes than the above.
My concern was more of the following: This is a temporary solution.  A
quickie if you may. The proper solution is to have the isolation part. If
we push this in, doesnt it result in procastination of "we'll do it later"
Why not do it properly since this was never a show stopper to begin with?
