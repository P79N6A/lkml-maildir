I read your message on LKML and the bugzilla entry. For best results with bcm43xx problems, please 
post to the bcm43xx mailing list or to the netdev mailing list (both are on the CC list here).
Unfortunately, you built your 2.6.19.1 system with bcm43xx debugging disabled. It is impossible to 
say what happened, but usually when booting to Windows fixes a problem, the fault lies in the 
firmware, but the lack of debugging info doesn't even let us know what firmware was loaded.
With the info you provide and your inability to test patches, there isn't much we can do.
