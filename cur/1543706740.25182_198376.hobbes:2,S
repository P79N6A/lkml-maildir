Did you get this message when trying your initrd? If not, you probably
forgot to pass the kernel a root=/dev/ram0 boot option.

This makes no sense as you're using pivot_root. The old method requires
terminating the initrd script, then the kernel attempts to mount
real-root-dev. That never happens as your script doesn't exit, but execs
init instead.

This doesn't even match with the 0x0100 above, now does it?

You should cd into /new_root before running pivot_root, or does the
pivot_root from busybox somehow do this for you?

Should you check for /dev/.devfsd on the real root here? I thought .devfsd
is created by the devfsd process, so wouldn't be on the initrd /dev?
