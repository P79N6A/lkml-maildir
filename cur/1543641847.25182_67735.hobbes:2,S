Hi 
One of my machines running kernel 2.4.18 is getting kernel panics intermittently (30minutes to 4/5 hours). 
from the logs I believe is the culprit:
kernel: LIST_DELETE: ip_conntrack_core.c:165 `&ct->tuplehash[IP_CT_DIR_REPLY]'(c6c78e44) not in &ip_conntrack_hash [hash_conntrack(&ct->tuplehash[IP_CT_DIR_REPLY].tuple)].
After searching google for a while i noticed this was the exact error for problems with the 2.4.10 kernel and apparently have been fixed. Here is the link:
http://lists.netfilter.org/pipermail/netfilter-announce/2002/000010.html
If you need any additional information let me know. Here /proc/version for the moment: 
Linux version 2.4.18 (root@roadkill) (gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.0)) #1 SMP Mon Jun 17 18:06:40 SAST 2002
Hopefully someone can help me resolve this issue.
Thanks
Merritt
