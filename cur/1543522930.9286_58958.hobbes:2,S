As a concrete example of what you saying: on one of our two
interactive general-purpose servers we currently have:
[~]ermine% uptime
10:33  up 29 days, 15:54,  227 users,  load average: 1.61, 1.84, 1.84
% lusers
 176 telnetd
   9 rlogind
   8 xterm
 217 tcsh
   5 ftpd
 448 imapd-4.1.FINAL
  11 popper
   0 apache
 528 distinct users
 649 sessions

and on the other we have

They're both old (oh, so old) Alphaservers with 1GB RAM: the first
has 4 x 250MHz CPUs; the second has 2 x 300MHz CPUs (both running
Digital UNIX as it happens, as you can see from the low uptimes
compared to our Linux boxes :-).

The second machine above does actually tend go over a load average of
10 at peak times (to 20 or 30...) but that's when it's even more
riduculously overloaded (~500 concurrent users our of a user
population of 12000). As Larry says, even with many hundreds of people
hammering on an old machine, the load average stays low when the system
is behaving. Now it *is* possible to make the load average go sky high
by running silly or buggy programs but we tend to catch and LART the
users that run them fairly quickly.
