...or number 3, do a conversion to 2.5.4 thread_info then embed the task
structure inside struct thread_info, like what was just done with VFS
inodes.  (embedding the general struct in the arch-specific struct would
make sense to me, whereas I can definitely see how embedding the
arch-specific struct in the general struct would be annoying)
