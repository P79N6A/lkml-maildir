Where does this KVA acronym come from?  In Linux this is traditionally
called direct or linear mapping. KVA sounds foreign.

It was partly a rhetorical question.
My point is that we don't make any effort to PMD align end_pfn,
so there is also no reason to PMD align any of the other boundaries.
The only reason in theory is to avoid virtual aliases with
uncached areas, but there are no uncached areas in highmem
so this shouldn't be a concern.
There might be overlap into the PCI hole though which is uncached
and needs care rgarding virtual aliases, but that could be handled
by teaching change_page_attr() to handle the overlap too.
I think that would be a better fix -- do that and then 
drop that PMD align requirement. Essentially you need a 
end_pfn_map like x86_64 has and use that in change_page_attr().
