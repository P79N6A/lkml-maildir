We have had many reports of exactly this symlink problem, and each time it
was a redhat user with a gcc 2.96, and switching to kgcc fixed it.  We have
one report (now two with Alan's) that 2.96-69 does not show this crash.
Hans, decisions about proper compilers should not be made in each
individual part of the kernel.  If unpatched gcc 2.96 is getting reiserfs
wrong, it is compiling other parts of the kernel wrong as well.  l-k has
discussed this at length already ;-)

Yes.
