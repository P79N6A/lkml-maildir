Almost... Same effect  (mostly)...
It does, however, leaves us arguing the linguistic semantics of
which name 'who' should have. It seems to me that the most
natural would be with 'who' being the 'name' of the target, and
'which' specifying which name space 'who' is operating in.
UGH: messing with these names via pronouns is too confusing:
-----------
    How about this:
int sched_set_affinity(int who, int which, unsigned int len,
                              unsigned long *new_mask_ptr);
'who' being a {process, process-group or user } ID , and
with 'which' being one of {PRIO_PROCESS, PRIO_PGRP, PRIO_USER},
respectively -- specifying which namespace 'who' operates in.
I think that that is what you were trying to say, right?
