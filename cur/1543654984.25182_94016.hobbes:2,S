Subject: new kernel can't boot
im using RHAS 2.1 kernel 2.4.9-e.3, to install oracle RAC on the server, we
have to change some parameter(character device - watch dog) and rebuild 
kernel.
I build the kernel according to the customization manual but the kernel 
fails
to boot, the error is:
  Kernel Panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 01:00
My root is on ext3 FS and I did the mkinitrm RAM Disk.
Cause im not in the email-list, please directly reply to me.
Thanks very much.
