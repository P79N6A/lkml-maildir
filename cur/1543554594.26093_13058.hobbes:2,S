   I've also noticed that routing_ioctl() in arch/mips64/kernel/ioctl32.c
   assumes the 16. Are those two platforms depend on having IFNAMSIZ == 16,
   or this code just needs cleaning up?
No, it means the code "may need changing" if IFNAMSIZ is ever
changed.  The compiler will warn us when this happens instead
of silently compiling the code.
