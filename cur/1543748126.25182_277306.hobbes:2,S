Do you have any automounter daemon running? All the window managers are 
really bad about this, even when told not to do that, they do (under 
some conditions I haven't isolated).
Try it running with X down (console mode). If the problem goes away you 
have a start, if not track the system with "vmstat 1" and post a screen 
or two.
