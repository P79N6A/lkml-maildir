I'm ignoring the "cross-compile perl" issue - haven't tried it for

perl is IMHO special (and quite different to others - including
especially autotools): perl5 is used widely enough so that "one somewhat
recent version" should cover all of 30 software packages.
The hard part are the CPAN modules and their versions which are really a
PITA.
As long as you don't use modules from CPAN, "perl5" should be specific
enough.
