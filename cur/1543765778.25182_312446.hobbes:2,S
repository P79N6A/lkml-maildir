Bear in mind that the reason I added the state tracking to the internal
jffs2_inode_cache state was specifically to deal with the fact that the
VFS can call read_inode() for an inode which was previously in core and
for which it hasn't yet called clear_inode().
I suspect that there's a way we could work around this problem in JFFS2,
and if not hch is probably right -- exporting the lock isn't good
enough; if we're going to change the VFS we should fix the actual
problem.
I'm confused by this though -- I thought we'd already _fixed_ this in
the VFS. What you describe shouldn't happen because I believe you're
missing a step:

wait_for_freeing_inode() waits for the existing inode in state I_FREEING
to finish being cleared...

... and this shouldn't happen.
