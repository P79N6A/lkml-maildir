Somewhere since 2.3.28 the PCI bios scanning has broken on my AMD K7. It now
reports
PCI: Interrupt Routing Table found at 0xc00fdf20 [router type 1022/7400]
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 0 of device 00:0a.0
PCI: I/O Region 00:0a.0/0 too large (54336 bytes)
(repeated lots)
PCI: I/O Region 00:0a.0/0 too large (54336 bytes)
PCI: Failed to allocate resource 0 for Ensoniq ES1370 [AudioPCI]
Under earlier kernels the right sizes are reported, and the card works fine.
Under the newer kernels it is unusable.
