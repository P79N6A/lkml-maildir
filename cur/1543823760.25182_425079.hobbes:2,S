Do you (or anyone else) have more information about this? If it's not 
possible to detect the underflow, it would mean that PIT isn't usable
as clock in these cases, as the clock would still jump around (just not 
visibly backwards).

IMO the else part is not correct. I think the whole think should look 
something like this:
	if (jiffies_t == jiffies_p) {
		if (count > count_p) {
			underflow or crappy timer;
		}
	} else {
		jiffies_p = jiffies_t;
		if (count > LATCH/2 && underflow)
			count -= LATCH;
	}
This would also basically solve the ordering problem, retrying the 
function would produce the correct result.
So we basically have two issues:
1. Fix the timekeeping to produce correct results.
2. Broken underflow handling.
If the second isn't fixable, it would make the whole thing practically 
unusable. I hope that it's at least detectable, so we don't use it as a 
clock, which would be IMO preferable instead of completely removing the 
underflow check (which would make the clock unreliable for everyone).
BTW another bug here is the wrong initialization of jiffies_p (it should 
be INITIAL_JIFFIES).
bye, Roman
