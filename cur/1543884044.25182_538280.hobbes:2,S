Subject: [PATCH 1/5] Add LZO compression support to the kernel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/1/300

Add LZO1X compression/decompression support to the kernel.
This is based on the standard userspace lzo library, particularly 
minilzo with the headers much trimmed down and simplified for kernel
use. Its structured so that it should still diff with the userspace
version for ease of future updating.
