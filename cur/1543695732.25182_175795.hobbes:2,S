That may be partially motivated by the fact that latest GLIBC no

Do you think that GCC > 2.95.x actually produces noticably better code
though?  I'm not convinced yet, and yet compile times can be a lot
higher.
By the way, it might be worth adding something to the input devices
section suggesting that people try forcing set 3 if they have a
keyboard which has keys that are not independently usable, and it's
not a regression since 2.4.  I have such a keyboard, and I saw a post
recently describing similar behavior with a VMS keyboard.
