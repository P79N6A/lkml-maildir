Kernel version is 2.6.9, but I see no updates to this function in BK-current.
How is total_scanned ever updated?  AFAICT it is always zero.
In mm/vmscan.c:balance_pgdat(), there are these references to total_scanned
(missing whitepace indicated by "^"):
 977:        int total_scanned, total_reclaimed;
 983:        total_scanned = 0;
1076:                        if (total_scanned > SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX * 2 &&
1077:                            total_scanned > total_reclaimed+total_reclaimed/2)
                                                               ^ ^             ^ ^
1088:                if (total_scanned && priority < DEF_PRIORITY - 2)
Could this be part of the problems with reclaim?  Or have I missed something?
