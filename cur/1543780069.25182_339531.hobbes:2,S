You shouldn't need acpi_bus.h anymore, since you're using PNP.

You're not using ACPI anymore.

I get the impression from other drivers (though I admit it's out
of my area), that in general, you should use MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE()
to export this table.

Should be tpm_inf_pnp_probe() or similar.

Thanks for using PNP and getting rid of the usage of
TPM_ADDR.  Now if we could just get the atml and nsc
folks to do the same thing, we could nuke both TPM_ADDR
and TPM_SUPERIO_ADDR.

Usually people just return what pci_enable_device() returned.

This is kind of a weird mixture of a PCI device & driver (the
LPC bus?) and a PNP device & driver (the TPM device).  Can there
be things other than the TPM on the LPC bus?  Should the LPC
part be split into a separate driver somehow?
I see "LPC" in the atml and nsc drivers as well -- is it
conceivable that the TPMs and LPCs could be mixed-and-matched
someday?  If so, you'd definitely want to split the LPC and
TPM drivers.

Just use "snprintf(chipname, sizeof(chipname), ...)", which null-
terminates the string for you.
