Yes I am. When I move some meters in the room I loose connection with
kernel 2.4 too.

That's really interesting, thanks for that hint!
Transmit: 1299 packets, 466 errs - argh.
When I can't transmit anything 'errs' increases by one every few
seconds.
As comparison: kernel 2.4.20 has 1743 packets and 9 errs at the moment.
So the interesting question is: why is the error rate with kernel 2.6
that high?

2.6.2 has version 0.13e, 2.4.23 has 0.13d. I diffed the orinoco.* but
there are only small changes.

Nope, it just freezes :-(
