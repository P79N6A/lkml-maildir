Hi All,
Is there any configuration option which allows to create
two independent multilink bundles in Linux PPP ? Though its not much of 
use in creating two multilink bundles in one linux PC, for testing
purposes i am trying to run multilink PPP sessions over pseudo-terminals.
I am able to establish one multilink PPP session over a pseudo-terminal,
and when try to establish the second multilink PPP session i am getting
an error message from pppd. "Couldn't connect to interface unit 0: Invalid Argument."
Is is possible to run multilink PPP sessions over pseudo terminals.??
Thanks,
Vanitha
