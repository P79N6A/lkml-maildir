actually, library mappings alone should not cause a slowdown, since we
start the search at MAP_UNMAPPED_BASE and most library mappings are below
1GB. But if those libraries use mmap()-ed anonymous RAM that has different
protections then the anonymous areas do not get merged and the scanning
overhead goes up.

well, could you check how much of an impact it has on KDE's kernel
profile? For the threaded test it's was a more than 10x application
speedup, and in the kernel profile get_unmapped_area() was like 90% of the
hits - after the change it was like 1% of the hits. (but, this test is the
best-case for the search cache, so ...)
if this simpler approach solves two different problem categories
sufficiently then i cannot see any reason to go for the much more complex
(and still not 100% scanning-less) approach.
