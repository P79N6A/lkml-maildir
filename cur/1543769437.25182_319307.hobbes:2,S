Far worse than complicated, it just doesn't work... I'm glad you found 
this before I did, I have loads of similar things, created when a number 
  of small system were decomissioned and each partition was written raw 
as a file. Like:
   machineA/part1
   machineA/part2
   machineB/part1
and similar. These were all 525MB drives, but the data is moderately 
critical. I've been successful mounting with all older kernel, except 
the SysVR4 images, which have a filesystem Linux can't handle (from 
Dell's brief adventure with SysVR4). Now it appears that I will have to 
copy the data to a drive to use it, which is a minor pain since the 
process is in scripts.
Another case of fixing a problem without completely understanding it, I 
fear. At least one machine had a partition with floppy images, I hope 
they weren't loop mounting them, although it's likely they just burn a 
fresh floppy when needed (boot disks for control PCs).
