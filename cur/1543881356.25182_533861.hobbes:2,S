Yes, this is the weak spot.
For some reason I had assumed that it was illegal to unregister a device
while it had registered children (just as it is illegal to rmdir a
non-empty directory).  If it isn't illegal, then perhaps we should arrange
things so that device_del() will recursively call itself for all the
device's children.

I'm in favor of (1).  But instead of making it mandatory, simply force it
to be true by having device_del() call itself for all remaining children.
For this to be safe, we also have to allow device_del() to be called 
multiple times (since the device's owner might not be aware that the core 
had already unregistered it).  That's no problem; just add:
	if (!device_is_registered(dev))
		return;
to the start of the routine.
