Here are some more details about my previous bug report:
The oops is caused by an invalid (uninitialized?) Scsi_cmd structure:
    cmd->cmd_len = 0xc0
    cmd->target = 0x3c <<<<<<<<<< used as an array offset.
    cmd->lun = 0xca
ncr_int_sto() passes this structure to ncr_complete(), and that function
crashes.
