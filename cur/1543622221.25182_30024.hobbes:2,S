I got this very same error on my normal VIA ide controller with every cable
I tried until I figured out that perhaps I should like, actually compile in
the VIA driver :)
Basically, reading would go without problems but writing would give the
above error and make the controller go back to PIO mode access. I agree
that it is most likely a cable problem but I wouldn't rule out the driver a
priori.
