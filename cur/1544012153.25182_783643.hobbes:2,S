We've observed this on certain other pieces of modern Intel hardware - 
the best hypothesis we've been able to come up with is that if the msr 
read is the first instruction run on the core when it's previously been 
in a deep C state, the low-clock speed is reported. However, some 
Thinkpads will also automatically limit their speed for thermal reasons.
