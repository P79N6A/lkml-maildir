IIRC, the discrepancy is because some browsers (IE, not sure about
Netscape) default to speaking HTTP/1.0 to a proxy if they are configured
to use one - a chicken and egg situation, AFAICS: proxies are assumed to
be HTTP 1.0 only, so browsers only send HTTP 1.0 requests - so people look
at the logs and think 90% of their users are HTTP/1.0 only anyway, so
there's no point in supporting 1.1 yet...
Also something to do with HTTP 1.1 being much harder to support properly
in proxies due to the new cache control features etc.??
