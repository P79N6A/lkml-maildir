I'm of the same opinion.  If I have hardware that has a problem, and 
causes downtime, it gets replaced or repaired.  I don't switch to a 
different piece of software to compensate for broken hardware.
With that said, I have seen ReiserFS expose hardware that had problems.  
Hardware was repaired, and ReiserFS rides again.
