Struct page is not the major issue. The primary problem is writing to 
the media (and I am not a flash expert at all, just relaying here): 
For some period of time, the flash memory is not usable and thus we 
need to make sure we can nuke the page table entries that we have in 
userland page tables. For that, we need a callback from the device so 
that it can ask to get its references back. Oh, and a put_xip_page 
counterpart to get_xip_page, so that the driver knows when it's safe 
to erase.
cheers,
