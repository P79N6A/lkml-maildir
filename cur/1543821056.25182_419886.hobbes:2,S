The evm code (which should be released soon) introduces an integrity
subsystem, using TPM.  The crypto part of digsig could become another
user of that subsystem.
At that point like you say selinux could mark types which can cause
domain transitions as needing to be signed, and, if lsm's not dead,
other lsm's could use it other ways if they like.
