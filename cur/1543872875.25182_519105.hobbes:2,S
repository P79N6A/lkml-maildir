Yes, I was missing the point. In consequence, drivers must not use
dev_get_drvdata() to get their references to their private data. It's
probably necessary to store it in struct sysfs_buffer and include that
in the store/show callbacks.
(The same does apply to interfaces of course)

That doesn't mean that the method needed to be thrown out.
Sysfs could simply pass through the syscalls for a device, like
it is done in character devices. I am tempted to recommend
such radical surgery.

I will look. Death to all race conditions.
