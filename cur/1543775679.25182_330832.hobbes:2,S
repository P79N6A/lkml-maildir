Good idea.   In the case of stacked modules each with a custom fs, having them
be part of a common hierarchy makes a lot of sense.
I'm assuming you are advocating for adding LSM support to provide some level 
of consistency in presentation rather than it _just_ being a new mount point
for every module to live under?
Take the discussion to the LSM list?
Thanks!
