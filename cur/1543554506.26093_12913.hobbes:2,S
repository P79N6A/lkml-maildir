I noticed there was no help section for CONFIG_EISA in Configure.help.
Here is a micro patch.  Hope this is not "really superfluous" this time.

+EISA support
+CONFIG_EISA
+  The Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus was
+  developed as an open alternative to the IBM MicroChannel bus.
+
+  The EISA bus provided some of the features of the IBM MicroChannel
+  bus while maintaining backward compatibility with cards made for
+  the older ISA bus. The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and 1995
+  when it was made obsolete by the PCI bus.
+
+  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for an EISA-based machine.
+
+  Otherwise, say N.
