Hi,
I have a reiser4 partition on a local IDE disk. I opened a 130MB textfile with 
kwrite, and killed it while ot opened the file (took to long...) diskio was 
finished at this point.
a [ent:hda6.] Process was eating 100% CPU time for several (54) seconds.
Is this a normal, expected behaviour?
After trying again, pdflush was eating much cpu time, about the same (50+ 
secs) Note that this happend after reiser4 panic (on an external disk as 
reported several minutes ago).
regards
Alex
