Yes.  Getting all the system management code right for when the journal
disk breaks will be the biggest headache of the off-disk journaling
implementation.  I'll never force off-disk journals and ext3-version 1
will not support them at all.

Right now the world falls apart.  Eventually you won't be able to: the
journal will be in a hidden inode.
