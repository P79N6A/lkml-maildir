Agreed, but does the current x86 code does map them like this or not?
If it does, I'm curious as to why they saw a problem which this fixed.
I've been playing with this on and off for months, and trying to
understand what is happening.  I posted my findings, and I'd really
like to get some feedback from others doing the same thing.
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT WHEN THERE'S NO DISCUSSION ABOUT PATCHES FROM
ANONYMOUS SOURCES WHICH GET MERGED!  FUCK ARGHH FUCK FUCK FUCK.
(BTW, "I trust Intel engineers" is NOT discussion).

8) I just try to understand what I've seen on real hardware.  It leads
to my belief that HMT cannot be a win on # processes = # CPUS + 1
situations on a non-preemptible scheduler.

Ack.  Even in the limited case of trying to get HMT to work reasonably
in simple cases, scheduling changes are not simply "change the
goodness() function and it alters behavior". 8(
BTW: Alchemy, Voodoo, Zen and Cards.  Maybe you should start hacking
on something more deterministic? 8)
