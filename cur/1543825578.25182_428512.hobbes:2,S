OK this is looking nice. And I was probably premature in thinking a
single simple call out to the oom code could replace your oom_alloc...
however it _still_ does a little bit too much OOM stuff for my liking.
Can you instead use two calls? oom_kill_prepare() and oom_kill_finish(),
between which you could try the final alloc? (also, declare functions in
.h files rather than .c files).
Lastly: currently, the final alloc only tries to allocate from the high
watermark because it is all racy anyway. If you've eliminated the races,
you might want to start using the low watermark for this.
Thanks,
Nick
