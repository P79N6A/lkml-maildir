To be fair, the patches I've taken (dev_err and friends) are _much_
simpler than these, so accepting them was not that big of a deal.  It
enabled the subsystems that have started to use them (USB and I2C) to
log better messages (we now know exactly which device caused the errors,
instead of just which driver).
So please judge this patch on its own, and feel no pressure due to the
dev_*() calls :)
thanks,
