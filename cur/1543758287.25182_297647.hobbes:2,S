You do not want to add yet another config option.
Config options are used to select or deselect major subsystems,
or support for specific hardware.
Not to tweak variables.
Adding more config variables is not an improvement.
There are many ways to set the loglevel from user space.
You add one on the command line - maybe useful in case more
output is needed when the kernel crashes in early boot.
I see no justification for DEFAULT_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL.
