That all sounds right.

Correct.

How did you run more than one SCHED_FIFO process?  If you are not on a SMP
machine, as soon as you run 1 of these children, it will run to completion
because it is higher priority than any other process.  So the next
child you run will run after that.

No, but I still don't know how you ran all of them.
