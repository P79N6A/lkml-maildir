I can think of a few files that we could merge myself, but we really wanted to get away 
from the two large (e1000_hw) files that we had, which was far worse.
We're open to suggestions as to reduce the amount of files, but since e1000 has it's own 
subdirectory, and supports a large amount of files, I think we're in the right direction 
with the amount. We approached it this from a rather superfluous amount of files 
standpoint knowing we can merge some later anyway.
One thing we've contemplated ourselves was to merge the smaller .h files into the .c 
files where applicable, so your comment goes duly noted
Thanks,
Auke
