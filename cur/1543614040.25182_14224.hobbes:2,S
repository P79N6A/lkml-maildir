Shouldn't be that hard. In the worst case I can do it, but I don't have
hardware to test it properly.

I don't think that's true, unless I'm misreading the code in 
__alloc_bootmem_core badly. It may not be the most fragmentation avoiding 
allocator in the world, but for linear allocations with no frees it shouldn't
waste space.

I agree that it shouldn't be tunable.
