But alan, that's the beautiful thing.  Given a CORBA object, you can
understand its structure without knowing exactly what the contents
are.  You can effectively derive it's prototype just by inspecting it.
The only difference between lisp and a CORBA object in this respect is
that each item in the list is typed so that you have even more info about
what to do with it.  :)
