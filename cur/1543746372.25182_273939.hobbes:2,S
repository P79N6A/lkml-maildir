Just curious to why you scale the interrupts from 49 down to 25.  What
would be wrong with keeping all of them at 49 (or whatever). Being a
FIFO, no interrupt would preempt another. Why would you want the first
IRQs to be registered have higher priority than (and thus will preempt)
irqs registered later.
