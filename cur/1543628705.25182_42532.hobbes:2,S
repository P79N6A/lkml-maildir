df(1) is wrong.  There is (see /proc/mounts below) rootfs mounted as
root (ramfs, actually) and ext3 mounted over it.  df sees two entries
in /etc/mtab (on your box - /proc/mounts) with mountpoint "/" and
does statfs("/", &buf); for both.  Surprise, surprise, results of
two calls of statf2(2) are identical - what with arguments being
the same both times - and refer to the filesystem where your "/"
lives.  I.e. to ext3.
