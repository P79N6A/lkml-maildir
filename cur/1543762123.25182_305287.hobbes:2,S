Probably also the cause of the memory leakage.  More evidence that
list macros are useful, just in case anyone needed any more.

Might well be...  But doesn't there need to be an smp_mb() right after
the increment in rcu_read_lock() and before the rcu_qsctr_inc(cpu)
in rcu_read_unlock(), at least for non-x86 CPUs?
On the long grace periods...
It should be possible to force the grace periods to end by providing a
pair of active_readers counters per rcu_data structure, one "current",
the other "expiring".  New rcu_read_lock() invocations get a pointer
to the "current" active_readers counter for their current CPU,
and rcu_read_unlock() decrements whichever one the corresponding
rcu_read_lock() got a pointer to.
When it is necessary to force a grace period, the roles of the "current"
and the "expiring" counters are reversed.  Once all CPUs' "expiring"
counters have gone to zero, then we know that all RCU read-side critical
sections that were executing at the time of the role reversal have
completed.  It is necessary to wait for all the "expiring" counters to
go to zero before doing a second role reversal.
This is very similar to some mechanism in the K42 and in Dipankar's
rcu.  See page 18 of 
http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/RCU/rcu.2002.07.08.pdf
for a better description.  There is a patch against a very early
2.5 that I can dig up if anyone is interested.
Once I get the lock-based method working, I might have the confidence
to take this on.  If someone wants to try it out in the meantime, I
would of course be happy to review their code.
						Thanx, Paul
