I am not sure how to debug this but it apears that 
in 2.5.3-pre1 and in 2.5.2-dj1 DEVFS is not working.
It started by terminals hanging and not being able to
shutdown.
I went to /dev/ and did a ls, it compleatly hangs that
terminal and I cannot kill ls.
I have the devfsd version from debian 1.3.21 .
