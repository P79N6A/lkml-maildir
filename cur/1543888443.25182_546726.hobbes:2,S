The problem is CPU1 receives 38239 interrupt-16
but CPU0 receives only 15 interrupt-16
CPU0 should receive more interrupts.
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:         85          0   IO-APIC-edge      timer

  6:          0          5   IO-APIC-edge      floppy
  8:          0          1   IO-APIC-edge      rtc
  9:          0          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   acpi
 12:          0        114   IO-APIC-edge      i8042
