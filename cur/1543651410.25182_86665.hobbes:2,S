I have raid1 swap. That does make a difference to the problem space.
When we get into encrypted raid5 swap over nbd (the security paranoia
dept - store all my swap crypted split into 4 disks in four
jurisdictions...) it gets really fun.
For the normal cases it doesn't seem a problem, even for raid0 swap
since before crash time you can generate a list of device/blocknumber
values and store it in the signed area
