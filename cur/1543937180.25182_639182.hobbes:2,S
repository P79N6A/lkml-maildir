Technically one should be able to pass a "const $type *" (which may
have been a "non-const $type *" before but at some point in time it
became "const $type *") to kfree().
The (formerly) constant contents as such vanishes IMHO (and it is not
really "modified").
Poisoning and free memory handling is IMHO internal stuff to the free
memory management subsystem and basically unrelated to the "life" of the
pointered contents before it's death with kfree().
