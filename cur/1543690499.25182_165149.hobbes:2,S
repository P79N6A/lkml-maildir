For me too, even with a normal keyboard attached to the PS/2 keyboard port.
In my case it's very rare, and not a 'constant stick' but short 'pulse' of
the same character like displaying 'kkkkkkkkk' in my terminal even if I'm
sure that I didn't forget my finger on the key. OK, it's not a showstopper
bug, but sometimes annoying. It's 2.6.0-test3 (vanilla).
I can't test 2.6.0-test4 because the machine is unusable with it: there is
no stable picture on the monitor even if I'm using ONLY VGA text console and
NOTHING else (nVidia Corporation NV6 [Vanta/Vanta LT] rev15). Screen
sometimes blank (monitor goes to sleep), sometimes the picture just jumping
crazy to random position in the video memory in case of scroll (or an effect
like this) etc. I can't test test5 yet because the lack of time, though.
