Hi all.
I got problems with the IDE code which causes the kernel to freez after 
printing out:
hda: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
kernel used: 2.4.18 crosscompiled with Montavista tools (ppc_82xx-gcc 
(GCC) 3.2.1 20020930 (MontaVista))
The ide interface chip is a PD6729 configured to ATA mode.
CompactFlash cards: winsys 1GB industrial grade and simpleTech 1GB 
industrial grade.
I beleive this is a timing issue and have tried to increase a udelay () 
to 2 microseconds (instead of 1 microsecond) in the ide_wait_stat() 
function - it took longer time to freez, but it still freezes...
Any clues?
Regards
Espen M. Rutger
