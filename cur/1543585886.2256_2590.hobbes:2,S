Update: 
Thanks to some advice and help from Mark Hahn, I downloaded
the DFT utility from IBM that checks and fixes their
drives.  A low-level format fixed the problems (the utility
calls it "erase disk".  That seems odd to me, since I
thought that IDE drives automatically took care of bad
blocks, but apparently this needed the low-level format. 
I'll keep an eye on that drive, though...
As for the 3C905B, I've already replaced it with an
eepro100, but as Mark suggested in an email, I will turn
off the "optimal" performance setting in the BIOS and see
if that gets rid of all the bizarre behavior.  Apparently
that's not a kernel problem but a bios problem.
