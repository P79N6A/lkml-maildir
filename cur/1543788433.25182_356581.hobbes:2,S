Could you just reply on the simple question : why the boot is not
stateless ?

In the fact (first mail) I give :
On [1] you could see 7 steps.
Step 1 to 5 is network initialisation (adsl synchronization, dhcp,
check on the dslam, ...)
Step 6 is software update
Step 7 is operationnal
When there are no firmware update the sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
When there is a firmware update it is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7.
But you haven't a freebox, so how could you have seen this that ?
Even other people agree that may be a GPL firmware stored in the freebox
(see 
https://linuxfr.org/~crevetor/19607.html
 and the author of
http://www.f-b-x.net/
 told me the same thing by mail [2])

non je me suis mal exprimé, elle garde le systéme sur sa rom et le met a
jour en cas de nouvelle version, du moins c est ce que je pense.
