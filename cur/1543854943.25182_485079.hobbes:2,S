May I say that FAT32 have a bigger limit (at least on last Windows).
The file in question have 4491771904 bytes, 4288 mega bytes , 4.2G or
4.5G if use powers of 1000.
I copy the file from one FAT32 to my computer (ext3), now I would like
to copy to other FAT32. But I just copy 4096 mega bytes (and terminate
with an error of limit file exceed) .
Have you a solution for the case ? Now I have the file in ext3 and I
couldn't copy to any vfat  :)
I have a solution with cifs or smbmount, but in same computer ?  
Thanks,
