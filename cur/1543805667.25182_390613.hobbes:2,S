Hi there.
I am reiterating this, while trying to diagnose the problem.
It is a DIY box with Asus P5GDC-V Deluxe motherboard with Marvel 88E8053 GB
ethernet (for info see [1]) and WD740GD (10k RPM) harddisk.
The NIC was not found by the in kernel driver, so I used a patch to sk98lin
binary driver, later tried sky2; both with intermittent succes. Now I have a
r8169 NIC and have disabled on board one in BIOS and put a new vanilla
linux-2.6.5.1
After some time (30 minutes to 3 days) the machine dies, first the disk,
some partitions mounted RO by the kernel, finally everything is dead (no
response to ping and KBD).
What I get in the dmesg is this:
...
[   23.464209] hub 5-0:1.0: USB hub found
[   23.464221] hub 5-0:1.0: 8 ports detected

[13091.481549] ata1: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
...
The full dmesg can be found under [1] as 2.6.15.1-K01_P4_server.3.dmesg
I checked the drive (on the same machine) both with smartctl and with the
boot floppy I downloaded from WD support site (Data lifeguard tools).
Neither reported anything bad (yes I looked the status after the test).
The filesystem (reiserfs) does fscheck on every bood, but so far corruption
has not occured as far as I can see.
As always, the usual question is:
What is the cause of this? Bug?
What can I do to better diagnose it?
Is any additional info helpful (see [1])?
Dmesg and other hardware info can be found here:
