Hi.
If you want it tested on some more systems, send it to the suspend list
(swsusp-devel at lists dot sourceforge dot net). There are a bunch of
people there who'd love to give it a go and suspend2 will make any
issues show up quickly. (At the moment, it calls
drivers_suspend() prior to the power off call to force flushing).
Regards,
Nigel
