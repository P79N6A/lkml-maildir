It has nothing to do with the compiler, but everything to do with the
C startup code.  In the Linux kernel, we have complete control over the
C startup code - it is in arch/*/kernel/head.S.
The only way a compiler can break this is if it creates a new section
.bss_im_not_going_to_allow_anyone_to_initialise_this and places all
the variables in there.  Hardly likely, don't you think?
The initialisation of .bss is a run-time issue, NOT a compiler issue.
