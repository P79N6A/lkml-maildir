Completly puzzled right now. Moving the prefetching to copy_to_user
(and doing the tlb preload & prefetching the whole chunk to be copied
(or cachesize if smaller)) results in a performance drop instead of a win.
My initial guess is that some of the callers of copy_to_user are
doing something that is harmed the prefetching.
(Maybe they are doing additional prefetch() calls)
