Subject: [PATCH] Don't map random pages if swapoff errors
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/19/57

From: Alexey Kuznetsov <kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru>
If read failed we cannot map not-uptodate page to user space.
Actually, we are in serious troubles, we do not even know what
process to kill. So, the only variant remains: to stop swapoff()
and allow someone to kill processes to zap invalid pages.
