Sorry.  But spin_locks with sleep is possible and doesn't it defeat

Ok. Now we have a basis for discussion. What's the gain that makes
"somewhat costly" addition to common case worth it?

So:
     P0: get sem A, inherit priority X; sleep on I/O; lose priority X
                                                      while holding A
?is this correct?
