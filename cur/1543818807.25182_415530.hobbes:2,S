I am attaching a final CSCAN scheduler patch for the 2.6.16.2 kernel.
The earlier patch that I had posted had a bug in the
"cscan_merged_requests" function. This has been taken care of in the
attached patch.  I would really appreciate if some one could help me
in conducting performance tests for the attached patch.
Many thanks for to all of you all for your inputs on this.

Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around.
