With CIFS or other password based protocols (including RPCSEC_GSS) all
the root user needs in order to steal your identity is to grab a copy of
your password or a credential. It is not quite as trivial to do as
changing uid, but it is hardly rocket science if the compromised machine
is one that you log into regularly.

What I'm saying is that the superuser can pretty much do whatever it
takes to grab either your kerberos password (e.g. install a keyboard
listener), a stored credential (read the contents of your kerberos
on-disk credential cache), or s/he can access the cached contents of the
file by hunting through /dev/kmem.
IOW: There is no such thing as security on a root-compromised machine.
