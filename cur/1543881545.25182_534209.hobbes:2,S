I've not yet looked at the patch under discussion, but this remark
prompts me...  a couple of days ago I got very worried by the various
hard-wired GFP_HIGHUSER allocations in mm/migrate.c and mm/mempolicy.c,
and wondered how those would work out if someone has a blockdev mmap'ed.
I tried to test it out before sending a patch, but found no problem at
all: maybe I was too timid (fearing to corrupt my whole system), maybe 
I've forgotten how that stuff works and wasn't doing the right thing
to reproduce it (I was mmap'ing /dev/sdb1 readonly, at the same time
as having it mounted as ext2 - when I forced migration to random pages,
then cp'ed /dev/zero to reuse the old pages, I was expecting ext2 to
get very upset with its metadata; mmap'ing while mounted isn't very
realistic, but my earlier sequence hadn't shown any problem either,
so I thought the cache got invalidated in between).
Here's the patch I'd suggest adding if you believe there really is
a problem there: it's far from ideal (I can imagine mapping_gfp_mask
being used to enforce other restrictions, but the __GFP_HIGHMEM issue
seems to be the only one in practice; and it would be a shame to
restrict all the architectures which have no concept of HIGHMEM).
If there's no such problem, sorry for wasting your time.
(If vma->vm_file is non-NULL, we can be sure vma->vm_file->f_mapping
is non-NULL, can't we?  Some common code assumes that, some does not:
I've avoided cargo-cult safety below, but don't let me make it unsafe.)
Is there a problem with page migration to HIGHMEM, if pages were
mapped from a GFP_USER block device?  I failed to demonstrate any
problem, but here's a quick fix if needed.
