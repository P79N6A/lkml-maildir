I've gotten some of the essentials off the drive, however, woudl still like
ot mount the filesystem.  I've gotten the drive copied into a 120MB Image
file with dd, but can't mount the actual drive.  The filesystem is S51K and
need to locate at least read-only support (read-write would be very nice)
for this drive.  I'm currently trying to mount as either hte drive or as
mount -o loop (both give me the same errors).
I was able to get the software to run under linux with the iBCS modules.  I
have to locate and copy in several files that the software is looking for
(it's own versions of TERMCAP (under different filenames), etc).
