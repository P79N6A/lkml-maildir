Yup, I actually noticed when looking things over, sorry about that.

Yes, I saw it, but on the other hand I'd like to avoid introducing 
complexity which isn't really needed. So the important question is: Is 
there a reason that v850 does things differently, or could it just as well 
live with separate .text and .rodata sections (Note that sections 
like .rodata1 will be discarded when empty).
The idea behind the cleanup is two-fold:
o Make it easier to add e.g. special sections like __ksymtab and friends.
o Make the building of vmlinux more consistent, i.e. share a common way
  where possible and explicitly document places where archs need to do
  things differently. Today, there's a lot of differences between archs,
  most of them I think just for historical grown-with-time reasons.
A reason to use sections of their own for e.g. __ex_table, __ksymtab etc. 
is also to get alignment right without magic numbers in vmlinux.lds.S.
One example of the inconsistency is e.g. the _etext symbol. For v850 it 
includes .rodata, exception table etc. So if calculating _etext - _stext, 
one gets a wrong impression of the code size, and generic code which 
assumes that there's code between _stext and _etext (kernel/extable.c) 
obviously uses a wrong assumption.

I definitely agree with (2), with (1) only if there's a good reason.
