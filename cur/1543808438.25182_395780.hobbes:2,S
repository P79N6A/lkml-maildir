That is what it did before.  By failing the ioctl, that indicates that 
the geometry is unknown, and that causes problems for grub.

Yes, I think this could also be fixed on grub's end.  It seems that 
fdisk assumes usable default values for the geometry but grub has 
different defaults that cause it problems.  I think that the defaults 
could be modified in grub so that it will work when HDIO_GETGEO fails.

There is no 'right' or 'wrong' geometry; it is all made up anyhow.

Except that most user space tools are not aware of dm and shouldn't need 
to be.
In this case, I think the correct solution is to patch grub so that if 
there is already a valid MBR on the disk, it should take the geometry 
from there.  If it is creating a brand new MBR, then it should use the 
geometry from HDIO_GETGEO and if that fails, make up sensible defaults 
like fdisk does.
