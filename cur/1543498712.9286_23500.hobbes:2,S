OK, so you have a point. How about looking around for comments or printk's
that arent't clear enough (foul language or not) and proposing patches, or
at least asking the relevant maintainers or this list what the
message/comment should say and asking for clarification? Call it "Kernel
Language Spring Cleaning Project" (KLSC for short, so it's a 4-letter word ;-)
Bitching here about foul language in general doesn't get the kernel anywhere.

How do I find out what code 0x0E means? What use is the address? Sorry, I
have bad memories of an IBM RT and its "error codes", some hex gibberish
you had to look up in a manual, that very often simply wasn't at hand. And
having the relevant manual on line isn't at all useful if the machine just
crashed. This particular type of stuff is handled by Oopsen in Linux, quite
well I might add.
