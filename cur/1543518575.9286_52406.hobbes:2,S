That's a driver issue.  If there was to get that information out of the
driver (ie, a flag that indicated the cable was unplugged, for
instance), then yes, the bond device I have can do that.  It's a true
master/slave relationship; all of the xmit devices are slaves, and the
master does absolutely no xmitting, except to queue a packet to a slave.
