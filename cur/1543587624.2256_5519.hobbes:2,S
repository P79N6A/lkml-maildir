I installed that, it fixed my one NIC... The 3COM. Or I assume it did, because
it shows up in ifconfig now, unlike the other one Unfortunately I still can't
ping the local host (destination net unreachable). I think that might just be a
byproduct of my main external card not working. Anyway, I double checked the
settings in both config files for the old kernel and the new one, the realtek
should be covered under the ne2000 pci mod. I built this directly into the
kernel and it still doesn't seem to be working. Anyone have any ideas?
Thanks,
  Matt
