Does it sound too weird, if our PCI accesses could accidentally
overwrite EEPROM contents on cards that have the EEPROM, R/W ?
we came across with lot of issues on the same unfortunately under
Linux only this issues comes up, we used to sling mud at each other,
probably for bad I2C communications on a BT878 based chip.
Recently, somebody came across a strange case where, booting into
Windows , fixed his EEPROM contents. Since i have the driver sources
for the described card from the vendor for windows, i don't see how
any way in which the Windows driver does rewriting the EEPROM.

Does this have any relation to the current situation ?
