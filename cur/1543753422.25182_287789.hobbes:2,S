As far as I am aware, from monitoring the various threads of this 
discussion for a
few years, the only reason is that nobody has compiled and submitted a 
set of
small, discreet, and obvious patches.  I suspect if someone were to do 
that, it
would be applied without much fuss or whining.  The primary complaints 
against
loop-AES WRT merging it (or any subset) with the mainstream kernel was 
that it
is a single bigdiff, with no real subdivision.
Cheers,
