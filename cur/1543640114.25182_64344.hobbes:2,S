Hi,
I have a laptop with a SiS 7018 soundchip. While playing music
the sound chokes every few seconds (2.4.19 kernel). I am not sure where
the problem lies. With the ALSA drivers under kernel 2.5 the problem is
not there.
Is there a newer driver for the SiS 7018 (trident.c). The current driver
in 2.4 is dated October 2001.
Greetings,
Jurgen
