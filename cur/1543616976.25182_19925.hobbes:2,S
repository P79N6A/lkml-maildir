An elegant solution is writing a program like kudzu and placing the
information it generates in a globally accessible place.  The problem
is that linux does really have a complete standard hardware database,
and until such a thing is built there are no short cuts, no easy methods
to get it.  And there probably never will be guaranteed unprivledged
user space access to the information.  The system administrator may
simply not want to let that information go.
The only thing that comes close to what you currently want is
devfs.
dmesg is for people.
As for ISA there is a reason even the enhance version that allows
software discovery is called Plug-and-Pray.

ISA is not a software enumerable bus especially not for unprivledged
users.  And no amount of complaining will change that.  That is why we
have PNP ISA and PCI.

If there was an ISA device in your example it might be interesting.

It sounds like what you want is an lsmod that lists compiled in
modules.

Please don't until you understand the problem...
