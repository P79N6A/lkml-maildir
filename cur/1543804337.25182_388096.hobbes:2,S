Subject: [patch 0/6] mm: optimisations and page ref simplifications
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

In the following patchset (against 2.6.16-rc1-git2), patches 1-4 reduce
the number of locks and atomic operations required in some critical page
manipulation paths.
Patches 5 and 6 help simplify some tricky race avoidance code at the
cost of possibly a very minor performance hit in page reclaim on some
architectures. If they need any more justification they will be needed
for lockless pagecache.
Do these look OK?
Thanks,
Nick
