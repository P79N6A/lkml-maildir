Subject: [PATCH] Disable useless bootmem warning
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This bootmem warning has been annoying me forever:
hm, page 000f5000 reserved twice.
hm, page 000f6000 reserved twice.
hm, page 000f1000 reserved twice.
hm, page 000f2000 reserved twice.
It happens because the i386/x86-64 boot code prereserves the mptable and then later bootmem
tries to reserve it again because it's marked reserved in the e820 map.
I've never seen a bug uncovered by this warning too. I considered to disable it 
by passing a special array of "ok to reserve twice" regions, but on second thought 
it is just best to remove it completely. Reserving things twice is not usually
an error.
This patch does this.
