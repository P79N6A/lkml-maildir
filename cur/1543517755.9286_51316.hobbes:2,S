What? Having group write on the directory? No thanks.
I shouldn't have to do *anything* to take advantage of hard links.
They should just work the way they've always done, which is what makes
them so useful.
AFAICT, the only reason to restrict hard links is to make some FS
easier to implement. Personally, I think that's a loss for that
FS. But changing VFS semantics is absolutely NOT ON. I will be very
angry if I can't do hard links with a decent FS like ext2.
