Hi!
I have a stock RH6.0, and been compiling 2.3.5ac1 for it, the kernel
boots, but the boot stops at turning on quotas, and yes I have turned
quotas on.
Compiling 2.3.6 and 2.3.6ac1: init freezes hard when trying to load
libutil.so.1, it says the problem is with the shared memory, the kernel
adds it cannot allocate memory, and then hard freeze.
I also comfirm that apm does not compile in 2.3.6{,ac1}.
What is the problem? I just _need_ lm79, now that it is summertime, and my
box is here in a dusty dorm, so I got to know about the temp and fans,
please help!
Thanks in advance, my config is attached.
