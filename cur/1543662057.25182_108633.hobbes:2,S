Hello,
While I can lock the screen fine (in GNOME that is), I can't unlock the 
screen (xscreen saver says my password is wrong, while it isn't). I had 
to terminate XFree86 to get back my desktop (bit of a trouble if I had 
any unsaved work on the desktop I guess).
The same functionality works fine under 2.5.59 and 2.4.latest.
I have:
XFree86 4.2.0 (the one in RH 8.0) - s3virge driver
xscreensaver-4.05-6 (the one in RH 8.0)
I can give other details such as XF86Config, dmesg etc.. on request. 
Later today I can verify this behaviour on 2 different computers (one 
using i810 driver and other using vesa driver, and may be another one 
using radeon driver).
Sorry if this is a known problem, please cc me if you can.
Thanks
Hari
