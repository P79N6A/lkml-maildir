Another config problem I noticed a while ago:
In 2.5.53, under Old CD-ROM drivers (not SCSI, not IDE), if you select
"Matsushita/Panasonic/Creative, Longshine, TEAC CDROM support", the
help text says:
"This driver can support up to four CD-ROM controller cards, and each
card can support up to four CD-ROM drives; if you say Y here, you will
be asked how many controller cards you have."
The user is not prompted to specify how many controllers they have in
2.5.53, and in 2.4.20-pre2, there are separate options for the 2nd,
3rd, and 4th controllers.
However, I've looked through the code, and I'm not sure if >1
controller is actually supported anymore - a lot of the code for that
seems to be commented out in 2.4.20-pre2, and completely removed in
2.5.53.
John.
