99% gone.  The remaining 1% is refill_freelist().  If I use
flush_dirty_buffers() there instead of waiting, I have no more
semaphore timeouts (so far.. not thoroughly pounded upon). Without
that change, I still take hits.  (in my tinker tree, I usually
make a 'small flush' mode for flush_dirty_buffers() to do that)
Feel is _vastly_ improved.
