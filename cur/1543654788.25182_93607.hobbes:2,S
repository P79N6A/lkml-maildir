Ah, OK - in that case I think we should update the configuration help,
it implies that it's for USB devices only:
CONFIG_INPUT:
Say Y here if you want to enable any of the following options for
USB Human Interface Device (HID) support.
Say Y here if you want to enable any of the USB HID options in the
USB support section which require Input core support.
Otherwise, say N.
Especially as standard keyboards and mice don't require it.

Good point :-).
