Ick, your patch was line wrapped, and all of the tabs stripped out of it
:(
Anyway, I converted all of the files in drivers/usb/serial/* that needed
it to usb_kill_urb() yesterday, and checked them into my bk-usb tree and
will show up in the next -mm release.
But if you want to tackle the other drivers in the tree, please do so :)
thanks,
greg k-h
