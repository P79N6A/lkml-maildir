Yes but the support costs for me of allowing that second case aren't
worth it, if people have a special case they don't lose anything by having
AGP supported DRM in the kernel or AGP in the kernel all the time..
whereas I don't have to answer a load of questions from people whose AGP
cards stop working because they build DRM into the kernel and AGP as a
module...
