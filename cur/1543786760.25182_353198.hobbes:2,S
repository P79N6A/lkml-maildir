All,
Velleman make a USB interface board kit with analogue/digital inputs and
outputs.
Linux kernel support is lacking, however the board is fairly simple.
Has anyone written a driver for this device, or would anyone be
interested in writing one?  I've tried writing one myself, but a lack of
knowledge on C and USB has stopped me.
Peter.
