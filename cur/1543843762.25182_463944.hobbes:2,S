- I was fine with iio
- udio, for userspace-driven IO (my favorite should iio not make it)
- idd, since it's called "Industrial device driver"
  (don't go about calling it iddqd)
more artistic ones:
- iofu, for IO From Userspace, or, on 2nd thought, simply IO-fu (as in Kung-fu)
- something else that's not related at all? /methinks of squid,
  which, from the name, does not suggest it would be a web proxy.
