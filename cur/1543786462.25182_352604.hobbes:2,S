Simple.  What we want from such interrupts, is to wait for them, no?
So lets use one of the existing structures made for waiting.  One example
is a file descriptor.  Do a blocking read, which the kernel unblocks when
the interrupt comes in. A file descriptor also supports things like
select() if need be.
