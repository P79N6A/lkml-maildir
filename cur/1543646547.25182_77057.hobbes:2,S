Hi,
The ALSA Menuconfig bug leads back to sound/Config.in
When you remove the entire if...fi block of CONFIG_SPARC64 or CONFIG_SPARC32 
of the ALSA submenu, everything seems to work. 
It seems to have nothing to do with the SPARC drivers though, for when I 
duplicate the if ... fi block of CONFIG_ISA (so there are two ISA entries in 
the submenu) after removing the SPARC(32, 64) block, the problems occur again.
Disabling CONFIG_ISA or CONFIG_PCI (the only options set "y" on my system) 
didn't help anything.
I checked the Config.in file for odd characters with a binary editor, but 
nothing was found.
Below you can find a "patch" that makes it work again. It is no solution 
though...
I don't understand it... All I can think of is that the parser goes crazy...
