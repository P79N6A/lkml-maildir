The main thing here is the PCI cacheline size for, for the PCI MWI 
mini-API (that I added).  We need runtime, not compile-time, CPU 
cacheline size detection due to generic vendor kernels.
As IvanK notes, this is a conservative "just-the-fix" change.  A more 
aggressive change is pending later on, that will move cacheline size 
fixups elsewhere (most likely pci_enable_device, but possibly 
pci_set_master).

   [PATCH] PCI MWI cacheline size fix
   
   This is rather conservative variant of previous patch:
   - no changes required for drivers or architectures with HAVE_ARCH_PCI_MWI;
   - do respect BIOS settings: if the cacheline size is multiple
     of that we have expected, assume that this is on purpose;
   - assume cacheline size of 32 bytes for all x86s except K7/K8 and P4.
     Actually it's good for 386/486s as quite a few PCI devices do not support
     smaller values.
   
   If you all are fine with it, I can make a 2.4 counterpart.
   
   As for more aggressive changes: I'd prefer to wait until pending
   stuff from rmk and myself gets in and the whole thing stabilizes.
   Then we can start fine tuning of MWI, FBB, latency timers and so on.
   
   Ivan.
