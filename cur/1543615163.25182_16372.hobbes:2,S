true, each filesystem needs to figure out how to make sure their on-disk
format doesn't change across kernel revisions...  Storing the raw i_rdev
onto disk definitely silly but it appears to be an issue some
filesystems will have to deal with.  I'm leaving reiserfs alone so they
can make a policy decision...
