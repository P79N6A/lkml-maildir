ok, i see what you are saying...however, the 'waittime' statistic as 
implemented, is only recorded when we don't get the lock immediately. 
Thus, it's really measuring the waittime when there is lock contention. I 
understand that in the non-contended case we are only talking a a few 
cycles, but the fact that the non-contended case is not counted as another 
waittime of even zero length (so no measurement is required), might skew 
the stats a bit. For examples, if there was a lock that was almost never 
contended but one time happened to be contended for a long time, its 
average wait time would look really high.
