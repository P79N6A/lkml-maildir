Checking the patch, my problem is that the old way, all BAR's were being
set at start = end = flags = 0. The patch makes it set all the BAR's to
the normal values. This is what it looks like in lspci, pre this patch:
        Region 0: I/O ports at <unassigned>
        Region 1: I/O ports at <unassigned>
        Region 2: I/O ports at <unassigned>
        Region 3: I/O ports at <unassigned>
So my device is not running in compatibility mode, and should not have
the BAR's set, as Alan's patch does.
