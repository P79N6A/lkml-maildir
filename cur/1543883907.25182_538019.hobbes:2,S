Any chance of splitting off a "struct boot_params" header (includable by
non-kernel code) for inclusion immediately?  The rest can wait until
2.6.23, but it'd be sweet to get this in place sooner.
BTW, wrt. a new "platform type" field, should it go something like this?
-0235/3	N/A	pad2		Unused
+0235/1	2.07+	platform_type	Runtime platform (see below)
+0236/2	N/A	pad2		Unused
...
+  platform_type:
+	For kernels which can boot on multiple platforms.  Currently
+	0 == native (normal), 1 == lguest (paravirtualized).
Thanks,
Rusty.
