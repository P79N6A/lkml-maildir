ah! It passes in a low-res time source into a high-res time interface 
(pthread_cond_timedwait()). Could you change the time(NULL) + 1 to 
time(NULL) + 2, or change it to:
	gettimeofday(&wait, NULL);
	wait.tv_sec++;
does this solve the spinning?
i'm wondering how widespread this is. If automount is the only app doing 
this then _maybe_ we could get away with it by changing automount?
