Subject: [PATCH] PPC64 PCI Hotplug/DLPAR Drivers for RPA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Please condider the following patch for inclusion.  This patch contains
implementations of the PCI Hotplug and I/O Slot DLPAR Drivers for PPC64 RISC
Platform Architecture.  The patch is made against kernel version 2.6.3-rc2.  
The PCI Hotplug module allows the runtime addition/removal of I/O adapters on
a PPC64 machine.  Due to firmware restrictions, hotplug operations must be
initiated by userspace tools.  These operations are initiated using interface 
files located at:
/sys/bus/pci/pci_hotplug_slots/<bus_name>
Development contact for this module is Linda Xie (lxie@us.ibm.com).
The Dynamic Logical Partitioning Module allows the runtime movement of
I/O Slots between logical partitions.  An administrator can logically 
add/remove PCI Buses to/from a PPC64 partition at runtime.  These 
operations are initiated using interface files located at:
/sys/bus/pci/pci_hotplug_slots/control/
Development contact for this module is John Rose (johnrose@austin.ibm.com).
Due to the size of the patch (~1730 LOC), I have posted it at:
