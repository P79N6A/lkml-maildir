How about submitting a patch, when the CryptoAPI and backcompat cleanups 
are complete?  I will apply to the wireless-2.6 tree, and we can start 
working on the kernel's overall 802.11 support from there.  I don't 
pretend to be an 802.11 expert, so I'll let you and Jean and other 
developers drive that end of things.  I'm mainly interested in keeping 
the API simple and clean, and maintainable.
