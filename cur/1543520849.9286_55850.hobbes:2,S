3COM has new Linux driver source for 905B and 905C cards on their
website. This allows the cards to run at their full potential and
with a great level of stability. I suggest downloading the new driver
code, it works a whole lot better and a lot of the 905B and 905C
weirdness with the old 3c59x driver is eliminated.

This status value comes from the interrupt/status register. It means:
- - 0x0001 -- interrupt latch (the NIC really did signal an interrupt)
- - 0x0080 -- statistics overflow (reading a statistics counter
register
            zeros it out: if one of the stats registers reaches its
            max value point before the driver has a chance to read
it,
	    you get an interrupt telling you it overflowed)
- - 0x0400 -- DMA upload complete -- a packet was received and DMA'ed
to
            the host
- - 0xE000 -- doesn't mean anything (these bits are unused)

It looks like the vortex_timer() routine "reenables" interrupts by
calling enable_irq() at exit (it calls disable_irq() at entry). I
think
disable_irq() just prevents Linux from calling the driver's interrupt
routine, and enable_irq() undoes this effect: this is *not* the same
thing
as telling the chip to start sending interrupts again. The interrupt
handler seems to be assuming that the timer routine will reprogram
the
chip, but it doesn't. (At least, not as far as I can tell.)

Using ifconfig to bring the interface down and then back up again
should
cause the driver to re-init the card and re-enable interrupts. If
this
makes the interface work again, then the vortex_timer() routine may
indeed
be doing the wrong thing.
> Has anyone else seen this??
No, but I use FreeBSD. :)
> Any solutions??
Go to the vortex_timer() routine, and right after the enable_irq();
statement near the end, try adding the following two likes:
                outw(vp->status_enable, ioaddr + EL3_CMD);
                outw(vp->intr_enable, ioaddr + EL3_CMD);
This should tell the chip to start generating interrupts again.

It looks like it could be a driver problem, however I could be wrong.
If re-enabling the interrupts like I suggested makes it go away, then
you'll know for sure. If this turns out to be the case, you'll want
to
send a bug report to Donald Becker.
