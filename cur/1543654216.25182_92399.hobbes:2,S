Not very much at the website, 
do you know its state and if it is included in kernel 2.5?
IMO each driver should be able (within resonable limits) to detect the
hardware it is written for, returning a simple true/false. This way any
driver could be asked if its hardware is available. With trial and error
it should be possible to autodetect any hardware. This way there is no
need for a centralize database. Of course if there is no driver one
could ask that hardware never gets detected.
