This used to be true, but it shouldn't be true any more. TOPDIR should
be gone, and everything should be relative paths (and all "make"
invocations should just be done from the top kernel directory).
But yes, it certainly _used_ to be true (and hey, maybe I've missed some
reason for why it isn't still true).
