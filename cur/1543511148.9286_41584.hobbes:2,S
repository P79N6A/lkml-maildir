If the interrupts get delivered then it is most likely a driver bug. A
hardware bug would either give you bogus interrupts (which the driver
is supposed to check for by reading the interrupt status register of
the device, before doing _any_ processing on the card) or you get no
interrupts and you have a real problem.
Most of the interrupt sharing problems I have seen have been due to
driver writers forgetting to check whether an interrupt actually came
from the device before they start processing it.
