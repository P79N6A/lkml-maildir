I got an email from an old list today, I had subscribed to ages ago and
forgotten about (tacile-devel).  As it turns out, someone (not me)
actually got around to writing an input driver for the ifeel mouse that
supports vibration.  I had forgotten that my mouse even vibrated! 
Assuming it works it'd be nice to get this into the kernel.
Just an FYI...
Download it here:
