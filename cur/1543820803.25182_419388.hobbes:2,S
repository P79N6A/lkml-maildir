Line wrap.  You might want to check your mailer or switch to a
different one.

Remove brackets.

To frown upon reversed grammar, I tend.  Hard to understand, such code
is.
With a decent compiler, there is zero advantage to put the constant
first - assuming you don't ignore warnings.  But it makes the code
just as hard to read as the Yoda-speak above.
