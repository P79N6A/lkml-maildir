Actually partly being guilty of it too - but as Andries points out it would
make much more sense to convert this stuff to sysctls. There is no
reason at all why you should need to reboot the box just to change the 
settings of the mouse.
[In fact requiring a reboot is very "Windows"-like]
If there is a possibility for merging this I can do a patch ...
