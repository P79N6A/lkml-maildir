For each individual type of error that is specific to a particular
low-level chipset driver (e752x, amd76x, etc.) there could be an entry
in the appropriate part of the sysfs hierarchy under the given chipset
driver.  This entry could have several settings that the user may choose
from such as { ignore, syslog, panic }.  For the implementation, there
could be a generic piece of code in the core EDAC module that a chipset
driver calls into.  The generic code would do the dirty work of creating
the sysfs entries (and destroying them when the chipset module is
unloading).  How does this sound?
