Short answer: because it merged with the keyboard driver code,
and the keyboard driver has not been modularized.
I'm not sure it is worth the trouble to modularize the keyboard
driver (maybe a y/n option for very special applications).
Is there a problem with always compiling the driver into the kernel
on machines you expect to use the mouse port? It doesn't use more
than a few K, especially now that it shares code with the keyboard
driver.
BTW, pre-8 (currently in testing) contains new detection code
that detects a mouse port without an attached mouse.
