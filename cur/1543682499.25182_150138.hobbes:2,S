    Hello all :)
    I was tweaking my GCC installation and, once again, I noticed
that the header include/linux/nls.h was being 'fixincluded'. The
problem, a supposedly missing '#ifndef __cplusplus'.
    Since this is the only fixincluded header, couldn't it be fixed
(I can make the patch, if necessary). I know, the kernel is C and not
C++, maybe the GCC people is a little 'tricky' when using
fixincludes, etc... but the change is small and is the only one
needed in the entire kernel in order to make GCC happy and get rid of
that fixinugly thingie ;)) I don't want to start a troll about this
issue, but I would like to know the opinion of the kernel people.
