Subject: InfiniBand/RDMA merge plans for 2.6.25

The 2.6.25 will open soon, so it's time to review what my plans are
for the merge window opens.
A note on reviewing: the upstream push for "Reviewed-by:" tags seems
to have lost some momentum, but it is still the case that if you can
get someone other than me to review your work, then the chances of it
being merged increase dramatically.  I'm talking about a real review--
ideally, someone independent (a different domain after the '@' would
be good ;) who is willing to provide a "Reviewed-by:" line that means
the reviewer has really looked at and thought about the patch.  There
should be a mailing list thread you can point me at where the reviewer
comments on the patch and a new version of that patch addressing all
comments is posted (or in exceptional cases, where the patch is
perfect to start with, where the reviewer says the patch is great).
Anyway, here are all the pending things that I'm aware of.  As usual,
if something isn't already in my tree and isn't listed below, I
probably missed it or dropped it by mistake.  Please remind me again
in that case.
Core:
 - Sean's inter-subnet CM changes.  My first reaction is that I'll
   probably merge it, but I need to find the time to really read it
   over first.
ULPs:
 - Rolf's IPoIB MGID scope changes.  I have the core changes queued
   up, so at least recompiling the whole kernel should no longer be
   necessary.  I need to look over the rest of the patches more
   carefully and make sure we have the correct userspace interface at
   least.
 - Eli's IPoIB stateless offload (checksum offload, LSO, interrupt
   moderation, etc).  It's a big series that makes quite a few core
   changes.  I hope to merge at least part of this queue soon.
   Outside opinions are welcome though.
 - Remove LLTX from IPoIB.  I haven't posted a draft of this patch
   yet, so I guess it will probably wait for 2.6.26...
 - I still have a few SRP changes from David Dillow to review and
   apply.  Nothing looked to radical so they should be good to go.
HW specific:
 - Neteffect "nes" driver.  It's not terribly clean code but since
   it's a new driver that is completely self-contained, I plan on
   merging it and letting cleanups happen upstream.
 - mlx4 WQE shrinking patch.  I would like to see this as two patches:
   one that vmap()s work queues, and another that does the tricky part
   of using smaller WQEs.  If I get a chance I'll try to do the
   split up myself.
 - ipath pending patches.  Nothing looks like a problem there; it's
   just a matter of actually pulling the patches into my tree.
Here are a few topics that I believe will not be ready in time for the
2.6.25 window and will need to wait for 2.6.26 at least:
 - Multiple CQ event vector support.  I still haven't seen any
   discussions about how ULPs or userspace apps should decide which
   vector to use, and hence no progress has been made since we
   deferred this during the 2.6.23 merge window.
 - XRC.  I don't get the feeling that even the interface has converged
   sufficiently to merge this.
