Yes, thanks.
This approach may have one issue. If user is using a on-memory fs as
/dev (i.e. udev), the inode is never freed, so blockdev's inode is
also never freed.
And if user is creating the many block special file, blockdev's inode
is also pinned additionally.
Probably we can call a igrab() for ->i_mapping instead of this approach,
however it's "run-time overhead vs memory space" trade-off.

With this patch, inode->i_bdev is freed in clear_inode() after the
inode became the I_FREEING.
The caller is holding a inode's ref, and if the inode->i_bdev != NULL,
->i_bdev->bd_inode never have the I_FREEING/I_WILL_FREE.  So we don't
need to check I_FREEING/I_WILL_FREE anymore.

With the above change, we don't need to care the case of igrab()
returns NULL anymore. Since inode->i_bdev->bd_inode never has the
I_FREEING, we don't need to call __bd_forget() for that case.
I think we need to address an only following simple race here.
              cpu0                                    cpu1
-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
bdev = bdget(inode->i_rdev);       
if (bdev) {                        
				   	bdev = bdget(inode->i_rdev);
				   	if (bdev) {
						spin_lock(&bdev_lock);
						if (!inode->i_bdev) {
							[...]
							inode->i_bdev = bdev;
	spin_lock(&bdev_lock);
Thanks.
