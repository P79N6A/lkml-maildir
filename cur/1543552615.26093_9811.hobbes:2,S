I am not sure if this message has to do with kernel development or not. All
I know is that most the people on this list are nothing short of being
genius'. My question is, on my computer I get an error when booting on my
/hda5 partition and in order to bootup I need to enter root user mode and
fcsk the partition. Is there anyway to fix this problem or should I do a
re-install.
