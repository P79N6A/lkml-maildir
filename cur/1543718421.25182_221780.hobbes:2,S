The kernel syscall ABI is on many arches different from the compiler ABI.
Adding an argument this way certainly works on the architectures I'm
familiar with (i386, x86_64, ia64, ppc, ppc64, s390, s390x, sparc, sparc64,
alpha).  I believe arm will work too, don't keep track of the rest of
arches.
Well, for s390/s390x there is a problem that it doesn't allow (yet) 6
argument syscalls at all, so one possibility for s390* is adding a wrapper around
sys_futex which will take the 5th and 6th arguments for FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE
from a structure pointed to by 5th argument and pass that to sys_futex.
If some weirdo arch has problems with this, it can certainly deal with it in
its architecture wrapper.
