Hi,
I've got a bunch of machines (about 20) to install Linux on and
I was wondering if it is safe to install a SMP kernel,
on a few non-SMP machines.  This would save me the hassle and
time with compiling for each machine.  In other words,
I want to have one universal kernel across all of my machines.
Thanks,
Tuan
