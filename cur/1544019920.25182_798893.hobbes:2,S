Think about it this way: it is a continuum of facilities.  Why is VRAM
different than, say, external DRAM that can only be accessed via a DMA
engine?  Now swap the DRAM with NAND flash and perform the same exercise.
Perhaps the most important reason is that you want to be able to use
this as backing store for swap.  Currently the mm doesn't handle swap
which is much faster than filesystems very well, but that should be
possible to address.
