Hi.  I have had a couple of problems trying to get this Motherboard
to work correctly under Linux.  
The Ethernet 10/100 is supposed to be an RC82540m, but the e100
module does not recognize it.  If you do an lspci it doesn't say
Intel at all, but just Nvidia and Shuttle.  Am I doing something
wrong, or is there a better driver in 2.6 than 2.4 or what?
Also, I am using the amd74xx driver for the chip set, but it does not
seem to activate dma or announce udma and a number as the via one
does -- is this the correct driver?
Any assistance would be appreciated.
