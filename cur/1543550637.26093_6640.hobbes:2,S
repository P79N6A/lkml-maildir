'Atomic' - a word that makes my ears perk up.  Tux2 is all about atomic
updating.  Could you please give a simple statement of the problem for a
person who doesn't know much more about RAID than that it stands for
Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (Drives?)
Given a clear statement of the problem, I think I can show how to update
the stripes atomically.  At the very least, I'll know what interface
Tux2 needs from RAID in order to guarantee an atomic update.

I truly believe that's a temporary situation.

But if it could be better...
