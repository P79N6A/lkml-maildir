More comments on the patch, now regarding this part:
+struct mmap_arg_struct64 {
+       unsigned long addr;
+       unsigned long len;
+       unsigned long prot;
+       unsigned long flags;
+       unsigned long fd;
+       unsigned long long offset; /* 64 bits */
+};
I suppose this is because the common PC has too few registers
for the new mmap() system call.
If prot & flags shared a register, there would be space freed up
for the 64-bit offset. Alternately, you could have libc do the
alignment check and shift the offset right to make it fit into
one register.
In case you do keep the struct, please put the larger items first
or add explicit padding. You have an odd number of "long" items
followed by a "long long", possibly causing an alignment gap.
