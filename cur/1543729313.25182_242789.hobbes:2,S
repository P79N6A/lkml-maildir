Also ide_unregister_hwif() still can be called on rare circumstances during 
boot sequence - see ide_register_hw() mail - it needs fixing first.

You forgot about the sad fact that most host drivers can be modular
thanks to prematuraly making them modular in 2.4. :/
ide_match_hwif() checks for hwif->chipset - ordering will not be the same
i.e. you load driver for some IDE PCI controller which doesn't have drives 
attached to it, unload it, load some other driver - hwifs will be reused - 
some sequence in 2.4 will possibly leave you with different ordering because 
hwif->chipset will stay as ide_pci not ide_unknown
There are other much more crazy scenerios when you consider using 
HDIO_SCAN_HWIF nad HDIO_UNREGISTER_HWIF ioctls. ;)

Yep, you are right.

Yep, please tell me how are you going to support drive hot plug?

I prefer short deprecation -> removal -> forgetting about them. :)
