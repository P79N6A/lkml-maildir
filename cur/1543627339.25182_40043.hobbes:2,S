Subject: ES1878 doesn't work in 2.4 series kernel

I have a compaq armada 1592DMT and have been unable to get the sound
card to work under 2.4.17 or 2.4.18 kernels (debian stock kernels or
compiled from source). 
This card is not a PNP card. modprobing sb with all the options (irq=5
dma, etc) will load the module but cating things to /dev/dsp produces no
output. If I do a dd if=/dev/dsp of=/tmp/dsp I get Sound: IRQ/DRQ config
error messages.
I have tried disabling isapnp in my kernel, I have compiled sb into the
kernel(and passing the correct parameters at boot), I have tried alsa,
all to no avail. 
With kernel 2.2.20 it works great. no problems whatsoever. Is there a
change in the 2.4 series that I am not aware of? Is this card no longer
supported?
Thanks very much for any help you can give me.
