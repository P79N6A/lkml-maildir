  I think this is correct behavior. The Single UNIX Specification
describes about the timeout parameter of poll() as follows,
	If none of the defined events have occurred on any selected
	file descriptor, poll() waits at least timeout milliseconds
	for an event to occur on any of the selected file descriptors.
  On the other hand, select(),
	If the specified condition is false for all of the specified
	file descriptors, select() blocks, up to the specified timeout
	interval, until the specified condition is true for at least
	one of the specified file descriptors.
