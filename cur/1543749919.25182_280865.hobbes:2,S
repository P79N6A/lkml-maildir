Subject: [PATCH] Secondary cpus boot-up for non defalut location built kernels
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
This patch fixes the problem of secondary cpus boot up. This situation
is faced when kernel is built for non default locations like 16MB and
onwards. In this configuration, only primary cpu (BP) comes and
secondary cpus don't boot.
Problem occurs because in trampoline code, lgdt is not able to load the
GDT as it happens to be situated beyond 16MB. This is due to the fact
that cpu is still in real mode and default operand size is 16bit.
This patch uses lgdtl instead of lgdt to force operand size to 32
instead of 16.
Testing Details:
----------------
I have tested the patch on all combinations of following testing setup.
Kernel:
------
2.6.10-rc3-mm1
Hardware:
---------
1. 8way, PIII, 
2. 4way, Xeon, Hyper Threaded
Boot Loader:
-----------
1. Grub
2. LILO
3. Kexec
Memory Location Kernel built for:
--------------------------------
1MB
32MB
Kernel Image Type:
------------------
bzImage
Thanks
Vivek

This patch fixes the problem of secondary cpus not coming up over a reboot. 
This problem was seen when a kernel compiled for non default (16MB) location 
is booted.
