4096 is the part that worries me, it doesn't seem like an unreasonable
number.  Basically, I'm worried that with 32 bits we'll end up with a
split that will be problematic on both ends for some device.

The NFS argument is strong, although the counter-argument would be that
we're localizing the damage.  We can say: "fine, we use 12:20 for NFS;
we expect that will be sufficient for the time being, but use 32:32
everywhere else -- that way if we run out, we'll only have to worry
about NFS."
Then we can hope that NFS v2 (v3 as well?) are dead or dying when this
becomes a problem.
