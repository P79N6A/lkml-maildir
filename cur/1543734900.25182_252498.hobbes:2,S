IIRC the two possible future destinations for ACPI events are this,
and the input layer. There are some ACPI events that clearly should go
through this mechanism (e.g. thermal), some the input layer (e.g.
weird laptop extra keys), and maybe some in between? I know David
Bronaugh was looking into this a few weeks ago, maybe he'll pop back
up.
