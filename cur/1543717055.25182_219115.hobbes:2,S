Hmm.. Maybe I'm wrong.
In particular, it should be safe to at least do the name hash and parent
comparison without holding any lock (since even if they are invalidated by
a concurrent "move()" operation, doing the comparison is safe). By the
time those have matched, we are probably pretty safe in taking the lock,
since the likelihood of the other checks matching should be pretty high.
And yes, removing d_movecount would be ok by then, as long as we re-test
the parent inside d_lock (we don't need to re-test "hash", since if we
tested the full name inside the lock, the hash had better match too ;)
