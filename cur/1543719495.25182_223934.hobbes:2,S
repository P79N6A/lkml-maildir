Hi Jeff,
The link you give describes a user space problem.
The fdisk versions that I maintain all work fine - apparently
Fedora Core uses something else to change partition tables,
and that something else makes assumptions that are invalid.
(Maybe it uses parted?)
I can tell you in great detail all about disk geometry,
and the 2.4 situation and the 2.6 situation.
