It looks like an operation like "show me the history of mm/memory.c" will
be pretty expensive using git.  I'd need to look at the current tree, and
then trace backwards through all 60,000 changesets to see which ones had
actual changes to this file.  Could you expand the tuple in the tree object
to include a back pointer to the previous tree in which the tuple changed?
Or does adding history to the tree violate other goals of the tree type?
