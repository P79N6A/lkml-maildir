So?  I don't see the relevance of this statement.

And this doesn't make sense (it doesn't contain a verb for a start.)

ARM is heavily embedded, and I've never ever had any requests concerning
"can we disable the scheduler from userspace" from anyone...

And by that statement you just agreed with the part of my mail that you
conveniently cut.

I tend to disagree.  In reality folk work towards removing such
dependencies.  We saw it with the old minix tools - they're now fixed.
We've seen it with others, which also eventually got fixed.
The general trend has been to be to fix up these problems as they're
found.
Yes, there are some subborn userspace developers out there, but they'll
continue to be stubborn all the time that their way works.
And finally, bear in mind that we have almost 175 ARM platform designs
registered so far this year, most of them embedded.  So it's a _very_
active space.  Couple that with the lack of folk reporting the problem
you're alluding to... despite ARM atomic ops being protected by
__KERNEL__ and use of ARM kernel bitops in userspace would cause link
errors.
My experience has been obviously different from yours, and therefore I
hold different views.  I don't see the problem.
