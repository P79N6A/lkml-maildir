I don't think that's right.  It's vital that TLB (of an active mm)
be flushed before freeing its page back to the quicklist, before it's
recycled to another mm (or elsewhere in this mm); but having done that,
it really doesn't matter much when quicklist_trim() (check_pgt_cache)
is called to free surplus pages from quicklist back to page_alloc.c.
tlb_finish_mmu() happens to be the traditional place it's done, and
that's where we expect it.  flush_tlb_mm() avoids flushing TLB unless
it's actually required for the mm in question: so wouldn't be a good
place to rely on flushing TLB for pages freed earlier from other mms
(but we'd already be in trouble to be leaving them that late).
I'm guessing (haven't rechecked source) that the cpu_idle() call comes
about because the top level pgd of a process gets freed very late in
its exit, and after a great flurry of processes have just exited,
perhaps there was nothing to free up the accumulation.  Though
it still strikes me as an odd place to do it.
