Yep, just have done that - well, they differ... First obvious thing that I
noticed is that 2.6 is trying to read bigger blocks (32K instead of 8K),
but then - so far I cannot interpret what happens after the start of the
actual file-read. 2.6 starts getting big delays immediately, even in
cases, where eventually the file is transferred (2 PCs with 2.6). If
someone can get some information from the logs, I'll happily send them.
The bz2 tarball is 50k big, so, not too bad for the list either, but it is
not a common practice to send compressed attachments to the list, right?
It's 5M uncompressed.
Thanks
