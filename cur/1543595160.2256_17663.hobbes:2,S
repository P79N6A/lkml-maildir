I always thought that, Linus was not the sole copyright holder on the
linux kernel.
Hence, didn't think hat he is not the only person to be able to sue. Could
not "kernel hacker x" sue if indeed some part of his work was used in
(what he assumes to be) non GPL compliant derivative work ?
Scenario: hacker X write ethernet driver for card made by constructor Y.
Constructor Y provide binary module to exploit super capability of their
card. 
Could hacker X sue company Y ? 
(well more interresting could be to replace hacker X by company X)
