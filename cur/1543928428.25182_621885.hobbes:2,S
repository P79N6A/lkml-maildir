Unfortunately, we tried to get rid of the x86-64 pda (like i386) but you lose 
the ability to use the stack protection config option.  That's because it 
assumes that gs:0x68 (or something) is the stack canary; we need a YA gcc 
change to make this gs:__builtin_stack_canary_off (where gcc can emit 
__builtin_stack_canary_off as a weak absolute symbol, so we can override it 
for the kernel.
Cheers,
Rusty.
