Yes and No.
No because, AFAIK p4-clockmod doesn't give a lot of direct power
savings. 
You can still get some indirect power savings from cooling perspective.
If the processor supports both Enhanced Speedstep Technology (EST) 
and p4-clockmod, EST will save more power and is preferred over
p4-clockmod.
Clockmod uses duty-cycle approach to modulate the freq. EST changes CPU 
core voltage and freq.
Yes because, with p4-clockmod you can change the freq between 8 possible
values
(Processor freq) * n/8, where n=1, 2, ... 8
