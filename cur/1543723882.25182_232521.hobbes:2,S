SWS avoidance makes us not send packets.  See this quote in an email
from John Heffner the other week:
================================
To elaborate on my earlier mail. my hypothesis is that somehow the web
server beleives that we sent a winscale of 0.  In such a case, when we try
to advertise our initial 4*MSS (5840 bytes) of window, with a window scale
of 3 we use a value of 730 in the window field.  All sender SWS avoidance
(RFC1122) tests will fail, most notably 1 (because we already advertised
5840 bytes and 730 < 5840/2) and 3 (because 730 < 1460).  With a winscale
of 2, we will use a value of 1460 in the window field, so both tests will
succeed.
