Would you be willing to work with Linux kernel developers to integrate 
the useful changes in this driver into the kernel?
The driver you posted is my driver, version 0.9.15, which is an older 
version of the kernel's driver and doesn't include many changes made 
since then.
If you are seeing a problem, please describe in detail the problem so 
that kernel developers may fix it in the current kernel's 8139too.c.

This is the preferred driver for the 8139C+ chip, as it included many 
bug fixes and is much faster than the version from RealTek.
