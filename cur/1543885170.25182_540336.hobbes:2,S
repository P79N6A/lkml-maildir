Ok.  So the purpose of lguest is to be an experimental platform and
as much as possible be a good example.

Makes some sense.  There was a bit of experience with booting kernels
without doing 16bit BIOS calls in nearly this way outside the paravirt
world though.

Reasonable.  Just so long as it is hidden under CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
And that people will know that mixing and matching is a problem.
Someday I might have to tell the story of the challenge of getting
the kexec on panic code path to all mixing and matching of kernels.

For lguest at least.
The delicate part right now is that lguest is attempting to use the
standard kernel entry point which does have a fixed ABI.
If lguest uses that entry point in a hard to maintain way it provides
a bad example, and it potentially leads to other problems.  So I
really don't want to see the bad example happen, especially if the
code in the bad example is as general as it is today.
That said we have two practical short term solutions.
-  A separate entry point made advertised with an ELF note like
   Xen is currently doing.
-  We reserve a type field in the first 2K of the boot param area
   and if that type is lguest we immediately branch to your code.
Reserving the type field is a subset of what we are looking at for
the next rev of the boot protocol that will handle this clearly.
We have enough in flight work for cleaning up the booting of arch/i386
that I don't believe we can have a complete solution before the merge
window closes.  At best we can get a minor rev and reserve the fields
it looks like we will need in head.S
Frankly I think the least risk of problems comes from just doing a
separate entry point for lguest for now.  It means we don't even have
to touch the common code path and later dropping will be trivially 
lguest specific, and certain to not break anything else.
