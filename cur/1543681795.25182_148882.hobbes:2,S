OK, I think I'll make it so and hope he doesn't notice ;)
The new dev_t encoding is a bit weird because we of course continue to
support the old 8:8 encoding.  I think the rule is: "if the top 32-bits are
zero, it is 8:8, otherwise 32:32".  We can express this nicely with
"%u:%u".
Now I need to go hunt down all those places where I added casts to unsigned
longs in printks.  hrm.
