... and why __down() always sets ->sleepers = 0 on return.
I don't have an answer, only a wild guess.
Note that if P1 releases this semaphore before pre-woken P2 actually
gets cpu what happens is:
	P1->up() just increments ->count, no wake_up() (fastpath)
	P2 takes the semaphore without schedule.
So *may be* it was designed this way as some form of optimization,
in this scenario P2 has some chances to run with sem held earlier.
