This argument is not timely.  2.3/2.4 is closed for new features.  2.5.0
is probably 6 to 12 months away, so the proponents of devfs have plenty of
time to improve on it, test it, and enjoy using it.  Until 2.5.0 is
released, let's leave Linus in peace to get a stable 2.4 out.
In the meantime, the proponents of devfs could lobby the distributions to
include it, but this is the wrong forum for that.
