At least for my machines it is the standard case; it is not rare.
And don't RH distributions install with LVM by default these days?
For those it should be the standard case too on all systems with
only a single disk.
The other relatively simple case I plan to look into (in fact
I already wrote something, but it's not postable yet) is dm-crypt
on single device. But it's a little more complicated than the
simple dm-linear case.
