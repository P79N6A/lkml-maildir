Hi Eric,
I am also troubling with the incorrect "nattch" value in do_shmat().
Actually, I found this bugs when I do some LTP testing on
blackfin-uClinux platform.
The "nattch" value returned from shmctl() system call is wrong. 
So I think your patch can solve this bug. But which version Linux kernel
is your patch applying for? 
I want to do some test on my blackfin-uClinux 2.6.20 platform.
Thanks
