I am not specifically away of any MCA+ISA machines, I just figured there
probably had to be one out there somewhere.  I am not familiar enough with
IBM's older lines to say for sure.
The probing code in aha1542 actually should be redesigned a bit, IMHO.  I
think the ISA PnP support was just pasted in, and it was clearly not in
the original design of the detection routine.
