I realise that my 'patch' isn't the perfect solution.
But how much sense makes adding a 4-port card and getting
ttyS14/15/44/45 for these 4-ports ?
As the first 4 serial ports, on x86 at least, are more or less
on standard 3f8/2f8/3e8/2e8 IO-ports an argument could be made to
reserve ttyS0/1/2/3 for these.
Reserving ttyS0-S43 (with ttyS14-15 as spare) doesn't make sense
to me.
And what if my next mobo doesn't have serial ports anymore and I
plugin a PCI card, I would expect them to start at ttyS0.
Anyway, I just wanted to point out that
a)these are strange numbers from user point of view
b)over kernel versions my ports keep moving to different names
   and I'm NOT plugging in different hardware.
I guess I'll just do  "cd /dev;ln -nfs ttyS14 ttyS2" and be done
with it or use udev (good time as ever to give that a try) or
keep patching my kernel or ...

Now my PCI ports are moving between kernel versions
