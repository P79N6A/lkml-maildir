Agreed with complexity.

Good questions.

I agree again.

but public: and private: are kernel-doc comments...
Using "private:" causes those fields to be omitted from the
generated documentation because those fields are for internal/private
use of the (statistics) infrastructure code, not to be used by
its clients (er, ugh, exploiters) etc.

Well it's not uncommon in kernel source files.
Where do we document how licenses should be written?
