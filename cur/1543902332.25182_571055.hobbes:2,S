Thanks for applying, too.
And then the dev_mcast.c is now only 256 lines long(versus dev.c 4052 lines),
just left a few multicast related functions definition and "dev_mcast"
procfs code,
I have an idea to merge all code dev_mcast.c into dev.c, that would:
- remove two functions (__dev_addr_delete, __dev_set_rx_mode) from netdevice.h,
  and then tag them static,
  those two are also defined in dev.c and only called from dev_mcast.c,
- reducing one file would benefit the compilation process.
All in one word, I don't think the single file dev_mcast.c is needed anymore.
