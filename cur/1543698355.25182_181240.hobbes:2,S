An update.  I've traced the problems down into snd_cs4231_probe().
After adding diagnostic printk statements, I get the following:
     *vcs4231_inb() returned 0xff
     *val is now 0x80
     *cs4231_inb & CS4231_INIT returned TRUE
     cs4231: port = 0x530, id = 0x0
     id is incorrect (id=0x00, but should be 0x0a)
    err in call to snd_cs4231_probe
err in call to snd_cs4231_create!
err running snd_cs4236_create!
CS4236+ soundcard not found or device busy
[all but the last line are mine].  the stuff prefixed by "*" comes from
  here in snd_cs4231_probe:
	for (i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
		mb();
		val = cs4231_inb(chip, CS4231P(REGSEL));
		printk("     *vcs4231_inb() returned 0x%0x\n", val);
		val &= CS4231_INIT;
		printk("     *val is now 0x%0x\n", val);
		/*if (cs4231_inb(chip, CS4231P(REGSEL)) & CS4231_INIT) {*/
		if (val) {
		  printk("     *cs4231_inb & CS4231_INIT returned TRUE\n");
			udelay(2000);
		} else {
			spin_lock_irqsave(&chip->reg_lock, flags);
			snd_cs4231_out(chip, CS4231_MISC_INFO, CS4231_MODE2);
			id = snd_cs4231_in(chip, CS4231_MISC_INFO) & 0x0f;
			printk("     *detecting id: id=%02x\n", id);
			spin_unlock_irqrestore(&chip->reg_lock, flags);
			if (id == 0x0a)
				break;	/* this is valid value */
		}
	}
Anyone know what the io port here does, and what the different return
  values are?  Pointers to documentation is more than welcome!  :)
Thanks!
