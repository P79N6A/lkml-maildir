hdparm can unregister and re-register an entire IDE channel, at 
which point the channel gets re-scanned.  The hdparm source 
comes with an "idectl" script that makes this easy.
Don't know about individual IDE devices, though.  My 
understanding is, it's all or nothing--IDE registration applies 
to an entire channel.  Also don't know how well Linux handles 
serial ATA.
