Apologies of off-topic or screamingly idiotic or newbie :-)
Booting 2.5.62 results in no console.  Looking at syslog shows:
Warning: unable to open initial console
I am not using devfs - /dev/console is there, char major 5, minor 1.
Kernel was built without MDA or framebuffer support, without serial or
parallel console, with CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE 1 and CONFIG_DUMMY_CONSOLE 1.
Problem has been present since at least 2.5.59.
System runs normally if booted with 2.5.24.
