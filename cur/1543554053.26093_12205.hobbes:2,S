RTLinux is hardly a fork. UcLinux is a fork, it has its own mailing list, web
site and everything. Post 2.4 I'm still very interested in spending time merging
the 2.4 uc and the main tree. I think it can be done and they are doing it in
a way that leads logically to this.
To a lot of people the ucLinux is 2.0 and our MMU based boards run 2.2.18 and
this and that are different is a real pain
