: Can you put fs/xfs from -test7 into the 2.6.1-rc tree and test with that?
	I did that. Under 2.6.1-rc2 wit 2.6.0-test7 fs/xfs subtree the load
went up to >40 two minutes after boot.  So it is not XFS related.
	I have also ran hdparm -t (under a load, though) on all of my
physical disks, and the numbers on 2.6.1-rc2 seems to be more-or-less
the same as under 2.6.0-test7.
	Now I will try to boot 2.6.0-test9 and we will see if it is
similar to -rc2 or not.
