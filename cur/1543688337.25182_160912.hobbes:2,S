Yes. I don't really like it if my program heavily relies on something
that can go wrong in some situations.

Not really. With {b1, b2, b1 xor b2} it doesn't matter what you read or
write first, no matter what the old data was. If they match, the result
is always either old or new.
If I want to get a checksum of 4 bytes then, I have to divide them into
two parts. Using the b1^b2 I can know if either one of them is valid,
but I can't know if they belong together.
Assuming that it's always either the previous one or the new one, I
think (once again :) that it's possible to check that by getting mixed
checksums: data = ABCD, c1 = A^B, c2 = C^D, c3 = A^C, c4 = B^D.
Except that the old data that read() sees could be even older than the
previous value. Maybe here works the growing xor-byte. I haven't thought
that far yet.
