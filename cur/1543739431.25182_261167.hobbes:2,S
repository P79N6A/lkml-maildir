I get these warnings compiling via-rhine with gcc 3.4.  What is the
correct way to fix this?  This came up in another thread and someone
mentioned that just adding a cast is not a "real fix" but just hides the
problem.
drivers/net/via-rhine.c: In function `get_intr_status':
drivers/net/via-rhine.c:536: warning: passing arg 1 of `readw' makes pointer from integer without a cast
drivers/net/via-rhine.c:539: warning: passing arg 1 of `readb' makes pointer from integer without a cast
drivers/net/via-rhine.c: In function `rhine_power_init':
drivers/net/via-rhine.c:555: warning: passing arg 1 of `readb' makes pointer from integer without a cast
drivers/net/via-rhine.c:555: warning: passing arg 2 of `writeb' makes pointer from integer without a cast
drivers/net/via-rhine.c:558: warning: passing arg 2 of `writeb' makes pointer from integer without a cast
etc
