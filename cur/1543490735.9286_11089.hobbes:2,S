And typical SRAM, at last whenever I've heard about it, needs *more* power  
per bit. SRAM electronics are quite a bit more complex per bit than DRAM  
electronics. That's also what makes it so expensive. One bit of DRAM is  
not much more than one capacitor. (And faster stuff is also typically more  
energy intensive.)
Of course, silicon disks wouldn't be made from typical SRAM. That would be  
silly. Instead, they'd be made either from DRAM and require permanent  
power, or be made from some sort of NVRAM like the "CMOS clock" chips, and  
just might be able to run from a battery.
However, I have my doubts that either NVRAM technology or battery  
technology is advanced enough to create affordable disks in the gigabyte  
range, and anything else would have a very small market.

Wasn't the usual rule 4x the price, 1/4th the capacity? :-)
