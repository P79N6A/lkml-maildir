Well, but if all the swaps gets used, you go OOM and randomly kill
processes. That means that machines have way more swap than they need.
If you really want to "solve" it reliably, you can always
swapon /dev/hdfoo666
where hdfoo666 is as big as ram, just before starting swsusp. We could
even make swapon part of swsusp where its locked to kill races.
But I believe its not needed. Problem just is not there in practise.
