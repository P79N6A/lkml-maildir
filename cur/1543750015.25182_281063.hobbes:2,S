If 2.5G of ram is really free, then how can the oom killer be invoked in
the first place? If that happens it means you're under a lowmem
shortage, something you apparently ruled out when you said
lowmem_reserve couldn't help your workload.
If you would post a vmstat before and after the oom killing plus the
exact oom killer syslog dump, it would help to see what's going on.
I sure can't reproduce your problem here with 2.6.10-rc3 + the 4 patches
I posted (so with swap-token disabled).
