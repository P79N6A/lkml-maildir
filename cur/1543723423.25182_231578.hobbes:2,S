No, definitely the cursor. And not only if the HD usage is high, sometimes if 
the CPU load is high, the problem starts, and if CPU and HD usage are low 
again, the problem is still remaining. I cannot really see a clear 
correlation between system load and mouse waiting, but there seems to be some 
sort of weak correlation.

I'll try later, but what should habben, what should I look for?
