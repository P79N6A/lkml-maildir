Compile-time *Option*, as in "IP-Autoconfig default to on: (yes/no)".
If you need to build a kernel generica for a platform where you can pass a
commandline easily, you just leave it at 'no', and get the same behaviour
as current.
If you need to build a kernel to nfsroot on a platform where setting a
commandline is difficult or impossible (like javastation), set it to 'yes',
and get a working nfsroot.
Simple.
Alternatley, having a configuration option to set a commandline, like some
other arches have, would also work.
