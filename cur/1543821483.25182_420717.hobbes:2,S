Sorry, I still don't have a patch for the PIT problems you're seeing,
but I did track down why the ACPI PM disappeared.
It looks like its from the patch:
	i386-x86-64-fix-acpi-disabled-lapic-handling.patch
The second chunk adds:
+       if (!cpu_has_apic)
+               return -ENODEV;
+
Right before we probe for the ACPI PM timer.
Andi, is there some way we can move that to after the ACPI PM probe?
thanks
