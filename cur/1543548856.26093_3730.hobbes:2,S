Subject: Signal 11 Error on 2.2.18 with kmail/Netscape client
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Over a pppd connection using chat on 2.2.18 kernel, and an ISP using
192.168. local administered addreses with masquerading enabled, if the
kmail client gets a 550 error <relaying denied> it bombs out of memory
and exits.  Netscape's messenger exhibits the same behavior relative to
the 550 <relaying denied> error and also terminates the client and
browser with a signal 11.  Review of the x console log prints a message:
"XXXX app_name XXXX: terminated with a Singal 11
This problem does not occur when using local ethernet.  ifconfig reports
valid definitions for eth0, lo, and ppp0 interfaces and they pass
loopback testing.  MUTT works fine when it gets the error.  The problem
appears confined to something in X.
