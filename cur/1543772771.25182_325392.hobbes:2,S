People have been edgy on these thread, so I read your response in
light of that.

Yes, I'd say we know each other quite well, hence my surprise at
the reading I made of your tone. I'm glad that you've read this
must amusement, we'll laugh it off next month at OLS :)

I know Ingo's clearly stated that he isn't asking for it to be
included at this point. This I don't deny. Ingo, however, is
not alone in working on this, as you noted yourself ...

Ah, well then please read my proposals in light of the sub-topic
that's been floating around in those threads regarding PREEMPT_RT
and fusion being orthogonal and how they could be used together.
As for "show me the patch", posting patches to LKML is by
definition asking for some measure of feedback. You're correct
in stating that until a proposal is made for inclusion, things
may change. Nothing precludes making suggestions though ...
In any case, I hope the above has clarified a few things. In
the mean time, I'll get back to the load of unrelated stuff that
I need to work on here.
Cheers,
Karim
