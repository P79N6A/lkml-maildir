To rule out hardware problems (harware not as parallel as you might think):
Try running the performance test (bonnie++ or hdparm)
on both /dev/hdb and /dev/hdd at the same time. 
Two hdparms on different disks should not take longer time than one,
unless you have bad hardware.
One bonnie with size x MB takes y minutes to run.
Two bonnies, each of size x/2 MB should take between
y/2 an y minutes to run. If they need more, then something
is wrong again, explaining bad RAID performance.
