I used those cheapy 8 Channel 8250 serial cards and modified them
by oring 8 interrupts to irq 3.
The IRQ was set to level triggered and on an IRQ one polled the
status regs of all 8 channels. That was _just_ OK on a 8MHz 286
at 9600 baud in a custom designed low latency application
(no FIFOS here).
