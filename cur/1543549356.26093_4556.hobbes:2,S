 Hello,
For my own edification I am writing a simple VGA driver for my PCI video card. 
I have two questions that probably many could answer.  I am using  v2.4-test7.
1)  request_region(VGA_IO_BASE, VGA_IO_SIZE, "vga") always fails.  
    How do I get the standard vga ports?
2)  Why aren't these ports listed in the resources? All of my resources 
    exist in high PCI memory?
Thank you for your time.
