And this is almost OT for this, but I'd like to interject here that in 
recent history, it has been very very difficult to properly access LSN0 
of a floppy.  Some formats, such as those laid down by a WD-1773 floppy 
controller, do indeed use a sector marking of '0' (zero) on all tracks.
This is akin to an old basic program that had a 'base' statement with an 
argument of zero or one.  We need, for legacy machines where a floppy 
disk sneakernet is in use, to maintain this "base 0" functionality in an 
easy to access format.  Ditto for sector sizes of 256 and even 128 bytes.
