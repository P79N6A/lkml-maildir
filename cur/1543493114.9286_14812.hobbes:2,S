Worrying over space required to maintain capability sets is silly.
At 24 bytes a pop (on Irix) that just isn't an issue.
The choice of capability granularity is a sigificant issue. On
Irix there are about 40. On DG/UX there are 330. Me, I prefer a
set that I can deal with.

This will depend on how you choose to map your capabilities to
your security policy. For example, you could choose to map
stime(2) and adjtime(2) to a single capability or give each
their own. On Irix, capabilities are mapped to the policy 
(e.g. MAC, DAC) enforced, without regard to the type of object
(e.g. file, message queue). On Trusted Solaris I've been told
(I'm not 100% sure I have this right) they have a seperate
capability for each (e.g. file MAC, message queue DAC). In any case,
the granularity of capability ought to reflect the system security
policy in some coherant way.

It's not so much that it's infeasible as it's unnecessary
and misses a significant point WRT system security policy,
which is that there ought to some reason to it.

To date bitmasks have proven sufficient.

This has not proven to be a problem in real implementations.

Again, this is strait forward, if not simple or painless.
One decides the capabilities based on:
	1. Desired system security policy
	2. Where you have calls to suser() in the kernel.
	2a. Where you have those Baaaaad euid == 0 checks.

I don't believe that you've made a compelling case for
the disadvantages of capability lists, as noted above.

In this, we disagree. In a world where all programs are coded
correctly (see TCSEC A1 requirements) you might have a point.
However, even good programs somethimes do things they oughtn't.
The principle of least privilege has a time axis; there is a
very real distinction between having a gun and having a loaded
gun.

The purpose of the inheritable bits is to allow a program to be
set up so that it can NOT have a capability (by leaving it out
of the inheritable set on the binary).

There are several ways to store them, many of which have been
discussed (at length!) here. Manageing and delegating them
are easy.

Having been involved in the design of the POSIX capabilities,
and having implemented them on a real commercial system, I believe
your stated opinions to be unfounded. I believe that I have
sufficient evidence to refute the bulk of your claims, and that
many of your assertions are based on insuffient information.
In short, POSIX capabilities are completely implementable.
