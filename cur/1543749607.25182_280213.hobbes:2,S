I have run some stress tests against 2.6.9, 
2.6.9 + ignore-swap-token-when-in-trouble.patch
and 2.6.10-rc3-mm1 on an Itanium2 with 4G memory.
With 2.6.9
OOM killer will be invoked within a few hours of stress test running.
With 2.6.9 + vmscan-ignore-swap-token-when-in-trouble.patch
OOM killer will be invoked around 30 hours.
While 2.6.10-rc3-mm1 seems to be much more stable.
At least for the test I was running, it bypassed 48 hours test.
