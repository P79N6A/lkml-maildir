If you don't like this behavior:
	echo "1" >/proc/sys/net/core/xfrm_larval_drop
but those initial connection setup packets will be dropped while
waiting for the IPSEC route to be resolved, and in your 8 hour case
the TCP connect will fail.
Anyways, the choice for different behavior is there, select it
to suit your tastes.
