I will be honest that I know next to nothing about relevant code, but
this looks fishy:
------

        if (unlikely(ret != 0))
                goto out_release_sem;
-       queue_me(&q, -1, NULL);

        /*
         * Access the page after the futex is queued.
         * We hold the mmap semaphore, so the mapping cannot have changed
------
The 'queue_me(&q, -1, NULL);' gets moved down, but just below where it
was we have a comment before a get_user() ... it is not possible that
because the patch cause the get_user() to be before queue_me(), that
we can have two (or more?) get_user()'s for the same futex at relatively
the same time?

I will rather leave this to somebody that now something about this =)
