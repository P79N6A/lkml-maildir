When I was working on security systems (back when I lived in Ireland)
we couldn't put hooks in our code either because the French government 
would not accept the software if we did.  You couldn't even put the
crypto stuff inside a shared library in case someone preloaded
something else...  I guess it's not just the US government.

 Robert.
