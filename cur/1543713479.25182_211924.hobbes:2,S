I Sent an email a couple os weeks ago about the same issue.
But it wasnt so documented and organized.
I can say that the card and hardware are inocents, maybe the driver, the 
"remote" machines that hang are using the latest fedore stable kernel.
I would need really good pointing to the procedure to debug the problem, I'm 
not expert in anything about kernel.
I think it's a problem in the network handling because it happens on different 
kernels, in different hardware. And it happens from a couple of months ago 
(we got a new faster network "arquitecture") and the problems seems to be 
triggered by fast transport of file over NTF, and distcc. I remember having a 
crash using scp too for some iso files.
If needed I can help track this problem, but I need some hints on the 
procedure
Max
