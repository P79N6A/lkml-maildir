I would like to add a few things:
- a previously suggested fix - passing idle=poll to the kernel - did not
work for me at the end
- the locks I have happen very periodically (somewhere around every 22-28
hours), as if the chip would die after a given amount of data transferred;
I know this looks stupid but I thought I might mention it
- I have about 1Mbit/s of (incoming) traffic on this interface: with
short, very high peaks, as there is a MySQL server on the other end,
receiving about 100 queries per second
- unloading the sky2 module totally freezes the computer for me
