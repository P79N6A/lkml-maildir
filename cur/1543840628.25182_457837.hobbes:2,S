AFAICT the first architecture that enabled interrupts while spinning
was IA64.  
http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/archives/linux-ia64/0404/9161.html
I did that patch because large NUMA systems were suffering from cache
line bouncing on spinlocks which increased the time that interrupts
were disabled.  This effect tends not to show up on small systems, but
it does make a measurable difference for large systems.
An additional benefit of enabling interrupts in the contention path is
that it lets you get in with a profiler or debugger to track down
deadlock or long lock problems.  Enabling interrupts in the contention
path has no disadvantages and it increases system responsiveness and
availability.
