From a short look:
core.eatmem.diff of course helps, but is wrong. You should talk to
akpm to find out why shrink_all_memory is not doing its job.
i386: +       repz movsl %ds:(%esi),%es:(%edi)
I do not think movsl has any parameters. What is repz? Repeat as long
as it is non-zero? I think this should be "rep movsl".
core:
@@ -576,92 +989,31 @@ static void copy_data_pages(void)
                for (zone_pfn = 0; zone_pfn < zone->spanned_pages; ++zone_pfn) {
                        if (saveable(zone, &zone_pfn)) {
                                struct page * page;
+                               pbe = find_pbe_by_index(pagedir_nosave, nr_copy_pages-to_copy);
+                               BUG_ON(pbe == NULL);
                                page = pfn_to_page(zone_pfn + zone->zone_start_pfn);
Don't you introduce O(n^2) behaviour here? Should not it be something
like pbe_next? And it is the only user of find_pbe_by_index().
I think that read_one_pbe() is too short to be uninlined... Same for
read_one_pagedir and write_one_pbe().
alloc_one_pagedir: why not just alloc page as zeroed?
Okay, it is still too big to merge directly. Would it be possible to
get mod_printk_progress(), introduce *_for_each (but leave there old
implementations), introduce pagedir_free() (but leave old
implementation). Better collision code should already be there, that
should make patch smaller, too. Try not to move code around.
That may be mergeable before 2.6.11...
