See my previous message.
Do not do what you are trying to do.  Dropping a lock and calling
schedule is fine.  Ditto with the interrupt part.
But note:
	- interrupts will be reenabled when you reschedule and still
	  enabled when your task is finally running again.
	- Since interrupts are going to magically restore, if you are
	  worried about the state of interrupts previous to your
	  function... you have a problem.
OK?
