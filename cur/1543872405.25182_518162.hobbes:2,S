That's a more correct I2C implementation.  If you read the specs, the
SDA and SCL signals are supposed to be driven by open-collector or
open-drain drivers, such that devices only pull the bus low.  Pull-up
resistors pull the signals high when undriven.
This avoids the possibility of damage caused when one device drives
a signal low and another device tries to drive it high.
Therefore, the correct I2C GPIO implementation is one where you drive
both SDA and SCL low by using a combination of the data direction
register and the output level register, but avoid driving the output
high.
