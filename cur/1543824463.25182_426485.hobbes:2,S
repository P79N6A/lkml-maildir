Vladimir's SCB2/Serverworks boots with and without "acpi=off",
and in both cases the IOAPICS are set up properly,
the device work, and there are the following messages:
APIC error on CPU1: 00(40)
APIC error on CPU0: 00(40)
APIC error on CPU0: 40(40)
APIC error on CPU0: 40(40)
APIC error on CPU0: 40(40)
These are the now infamous "Receive illegal vector" messages.
I expect this chipset has a physical APIC bus (rather than
the FSB delivery used today) which is mis-behaving.
I've never heard of this being associated with an actual
failure (such as a lost interrupt).  This message is already
KERN_DEBUG -- can't get any lower priority than that.
Maybe we should put this message under apic_printk()?
Since acpi=off doesn't make any difference, I recommend
running in the default configuration without this parameter.

Jan's system has
APIC error on CPU0: 02(02)
Also seems to be receiving junk on the APIC bus.

My comment about PIC-mode probably being okay applies to this
motherboard
but not Vladimir's above.

This is a SiS746 motherboard.
This kind of error seems to be relatively common on SiS.
