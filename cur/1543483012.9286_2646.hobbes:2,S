While we are on the subject... what thinks ye of a general solution 
expanding the lseek syscall offset parameter to 64 bits.  Thus files 
in all filesystems could grow into terabyte range without suffering API 
constraints, new syscalls, etc.  
Of course, there may be some impact on underlying vfs, buffering, and/or
filesystem code (say he, trying to suppress a smile).  But, seriously,
that seems a worthy price to pay to get beyond the 2G limit, once and 
for all, everywhere.
