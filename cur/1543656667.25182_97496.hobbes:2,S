File bug anyway and worry about it later. The bugzilla elves regularly
go through the database cleaning up crufty bits, marking dupes,
closing invalids, world peace etc etc. It seems to be holding
up well so far.  Of the 180 bugs filed, I think I've personally rejected
<10 dupes/invalids. Other folks haven't done that many too.
Here's to hoping it continues to remain high signal.
