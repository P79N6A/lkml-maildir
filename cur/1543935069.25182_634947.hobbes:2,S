    Do you have a source for this -- haven't heard of such a conflict -- 
besides, doesn't
ATA-7 require some of those functions?  Given the trend toward 
power-saving and
quieter (also usually less vibration)  hard disks, I strongly disbelieve 
Seagate would
remove those features -- especially since they are mentioned on 
Seagate's drive
information page as being supported features.
