well, IMHO in the huge majority of cases the prev_page check isn't
necessary in the first place (and IMHO it hurts a lot more than it can
help, as demonstrated by specweb, since we'll bite on the good guys to
help the bad guys).
The only case where I can imagine the prev_page to make sense is to
handle contiguous I/O made with a small buffer, so clearly an
inefficient code in the first place. But if this guy is reading with
<PAGE_SIZE buffer there's no guarantee that he's reading f_pos aligned
either, hence the need of taking last_offset into account too so at
least it's a "perfect" heuristic that will reliably detect contiguous
I/O no matter in what shape or form you execute it, as long as it is
contiguous I/O.
Any other variation of behavior besides the autodetection of
contiguous I/O run in whatever buffer/aligned form, should be mandated
by userland through fadvise/madvise IMHO or we run into the toes of
the good guys.
