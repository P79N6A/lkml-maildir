Erm...  Depends on the nature of lock.  Spinlocks are out of question,
obviously (at the very least we reread partition table if disk had been
changed and you can't make that nonblocking ;-).  Semaphore might work,
but I would be very careful with deadlocks - the same rereading partition
table could add or remove devfs entries.
Could you describe what are you trying to achieve in the callers of
check_disc_changed()?  I'd been unable to deduce that from code and
some comments would be very welcome.
