Subject: [PATCH] ACPI maintainer change
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/9/17/109

Hi Linus and Marcelo,
The following patch updates the maintainer entry for ACPI. Len has
already assumed most of this responsibility, as other projects demand my
attention.
My team will continue to maintain the OS-independent ACPI CA release,
but Len will be responsible for pulling ACPI CA updates into the Linux
release, and the rest of Linux-specific code in general.
This should apply cleanly against 2.6-bk-latest and against
2.4-bk-latest with an offset.
Regards -- Andy
