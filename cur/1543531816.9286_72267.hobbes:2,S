Hi,
I would like to suggest a compromise between overcommiting/non-overcommiting:
- keep overcommiting for normal operation
- allow processes (and the kernel) to reserve an amount of vm, as long as the 
sum of the reserved vm doesn't exceed the amount of available vm
- at OOM, kill only processes which exceeds their reserved amount of vm
The reservation request could be intercepted by an userspace daemon to enforce 
policy.
