   kexec -p <dump-capture-kernel-vmlinux-image> \
   --initrd=<initrd-for-dump-capture-kernel> --args-linux \
   --append="root=<root-dev> <arch-specific-options>"
....so we are already using initrd for dumping...? I'd say providing
visual feedback is surely an userspace task.
Heck, with the keyboard leds you could probably blink them in a way
telling user how much dump was done. Blink once then pause - 10%,
blink twice then pause - 20%, ...
And yes, we already have LED subsystem capable of doing all this.
