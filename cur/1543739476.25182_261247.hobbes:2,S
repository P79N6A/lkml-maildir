The difficulty in building on a case-insensitive filesystem may
be the only hope these developers have for escaping Windows.
You turn "we must have Linux build systems to build our product"
into the less effective "we want Linux".       
For the sake of these suffering developers, it would be better
to make sure that building Linux on Windows is a lost cause.
We could name a file "con" or "a:foo" for example.
