Well, to say the truth, when I tested it with 2.4.49, my IBM disk was running
mutch slower than without TCQ, so I rebuilt a kernel without it just after one
hour of tests.
I think it will be difficoult that people will use it longer that 5 minutes if
they don't see some performance gain (except people using it because they
have some serious interess to develop IDE TCQ code).
On the other side, also if there are stability problems, a lot of people will
test it if they think they can gain a better performance.
