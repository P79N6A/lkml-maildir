not me, boss - I told 'em that using sigset_t in compat.h was a minefield. 
sparc64 built OK with my hack-shouldnt-be-merged patch applied, which is
how it was tested in -mm.
I don't know what a good fix is, really.  I guess one could put the
declaration of sigset_from_compat() into its own header file and include
that header from the right places.
