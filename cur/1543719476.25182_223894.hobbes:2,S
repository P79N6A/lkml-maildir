I remembered other artikel about gig-E problems, so after re-reading
this cured it:
****************
From: walt <wa1ter@myrealbox.com>
[1] Gigabit Kconfig problems with yesterday's update
Distribution: cistron
I have one machine with a gigabit NIC which I updated today from Linus'
bk tree.
The problem is that I was not asked if I wanted the 'new' gigabit
support and therefore the tg3 support was dropped from my new .config.
I edited .config by hand and deleted any mention of ethernet support --
and only then did 'make oldconfig' ask me the right questions.
Also: the phrase (10 or 100Mbit) should be deleted from the 'Ethernet'
menu item since it implies (wrongly) that the item is not needed for
gigabit support.
