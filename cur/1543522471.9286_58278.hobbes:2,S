And much more waste. I recently discovered that a ~5GB 4K ext2 source 
code partition has ~480MB wasted in file tails. The same fileset
(about 192k files) would only waste ~108MB with 1K blocks.
So sometimes 1K blocks or file tail packing (like in UFS or reiserfs) 
are a good idea. Unfortunately both are somewhat discouraged in 2.3 (the
new IO paths seem to be heavily optimized for page sized IO only)
