drivers/char/drm/drmP.h has at line 53:
#include <asm/spinlock.h>
But it should actually be:
#include <linux/spinlock.h>
I changed this in my tree, recompiled with the Voodoo3 drivers and I am
happily working with the pre1 kernel, XFree86 4.0 with mtrrs enabled.
There may be more to this, but so far so good for about 10 or 12 hours.
Sorry it's not a patch, but heck it's only a single line... :o)
