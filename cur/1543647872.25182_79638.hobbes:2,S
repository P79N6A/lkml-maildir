Thanks!

Yes.

It's not so important.
davem> Personally, it seems rather essential for scalability on SMP.
Yes.
It will be effective on large scale SMP machines as all kNFSd shares
one NFS port. A udp socket can't send data on each CPU at the same
time while MSG_MORE/UDP_CORK options are set.
The UDP socket have to block any other requests during making a UDP frame.
Thank you,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
