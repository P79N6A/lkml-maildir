Subject: readcd hangs in blk_execute_rq

I'm trying to readcd a cd, in 2.6.9+todays BK snapshot.
I got an error the first time so I started it (readcd dev=/dev/hdc)
the second time and chose c2scan. This resulted in the messages
...
end:    328460
C2 in sector: 1864 first at byte: 2256 (0xF0) total:   72 errors
C2 in sector: 1865 first at byte:   12 (0x0F) total: 2335 errors
addr:     2499 cnt: 49
And here it hangs. ps shows readcd is in D state, in blk_execute_rq.
dmesg shows lines of
hdc: lost interrupt
every no and then.
This a IDE CD on Intel ICH2 ide controller:
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
ICH2: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:1f.1
ICH2: chipset revision 2
ICH2: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xffa0-0xffa7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xffa8-0xffaf, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hdc: CDU5211, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hdc: ATAPI 52X CD-ROM drive, 120kB Cache, UDMA(33)
And after every boot it gets DMA timeout on first read and switches to
PIO mode and works fine there reading data cd-s (even browsing the same
CD):
ide-cd: cmd 0x28 timed out
hdc: DMA interrupt recovery
hdc: lost interrupt
hdc: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdc: status timeout: error=0x00
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: drive not ready for command
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
