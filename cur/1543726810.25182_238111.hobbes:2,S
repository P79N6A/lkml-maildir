	Then we have a severe disagreement between the cdrecord code (or at 
least the runtime warnings) and the Linux-Kernel IDE folks. 
specifically, these lines, while running with cdrecord dev=/dev/cdrom
scsidev: '/dev/cdrom'
devname: '/dev/cdrom'
scsibus: -2 target: -2 lun: -2
Warning: Open by 'devname' is unintentional and not supported.
	I've attached two logs, one using the ATAPI interface, one using your 
suggested interface. Frankly, both have rather nasty warnings on them, 
and one gets to wondering what the cdrecord authors want...
	Maybe we should be cc:ing the authors of cdrecord as well?
