That would work.  Chris has the right idea, though.  Just set up
linux-next as a remote on any existing clone of Linus' tree and the
"fetch" will forcibly update the linux-next/master branch (remember to
not have that branch checked out when you fetch).
If you keep a continuing git tree for this, you will have the history of
all the next trees because I tag each one.

I said in the original announcement that the "master" branch would be
rebasing every day (well, I actually said that I would recreate the tree
every day).
Each day, I start with the latest version of Linus' tree (my "stable"
branch) and then merge all the subsystem trees on that.

Sounds like a plan.  So new "normal" announcements will happen on the
linux-next mailing list and "abnormal" ones to LKML as well (at least).
