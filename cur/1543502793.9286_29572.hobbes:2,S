You are presumably aware that 2.0.36-0.7 was a pre-release kernel? I
can also confirm that it was unstable on both my computers, and for
that reason, I would not suggest that anybody remain with it, or use
it as a basis for comparison.
Have a look at 
http://updates.redhat.com/5.2/
$ARCH/ where you will
find kernel-2.0.36-3.$ARCH.rpm which uses the final release of that
particular kernel, and I seem to remember that several problems in the
2.0.36-0.7 release were fixed in the 2.0.36-3 release. You may be
hitting something caused there...
Best wishes from Riley.
