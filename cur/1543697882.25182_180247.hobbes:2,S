It worked, but I had -- as expected -- to write the oops by hand.
(user request to Randy: would it be possible to have an option in 
kmsgdump to only write the first oops on floppy ???)
I it have all on paper, but I'm too lazy to write the full stack right 
now (available later on request: I have to go to bed now 8):

The modem_run process is the one uploading the firmware for my 
speedtouch dsl modem. I'm using the kernel-space speedtouch driver, with 
modem_run from 
http://speedtouch.sourceforge.net/
Manually shutting down the network and killing modem_run before 
rebooting makes the oops disapear.
  However, I believe the fact that modem_run can cause a kernel panic is 
still a bug that should be fixed. I'm willing to test any patch to fix 
this issue that has ennoyed me since a long time (in the meantime, I'll 
work around this in my shutdown scripts). :-)
