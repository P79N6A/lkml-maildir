Ahh, yes.  I see it now.
CONFIG_SIS900=m
CONFIG_CRC32=y
The makefile rules took the most stringent of =m and =y and made it =y.
But, nothing CONFIG_XXX=y in vmlinux needs the crc32 functions, so the
linker threw the code away.
Partial solution:  CONFIG_CRC32=m
Is there a better way to handle this type of situation?  Personally, I like
leaving CONFIG_CRC32=m set always (assuming you've got modules), and let the
makefile rules set it to =y if something else =y needs it.
Thanks,
Matt
