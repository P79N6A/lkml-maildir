Nice.
This is a subset of -Wmissing-prototypes warnings, and I'm working for 
some time to get the function prototypes into header files to avoid such 
bugs (that can in some cases lead to nasty stack corruptions).
But they should be fixed properly by moving the prototypes to header 
files.

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
