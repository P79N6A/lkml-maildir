This is what happens:
[   19.617890] Testing NMI watchdog ... <6>ACPI: No ACPI bus support
for 2-2 [   19.705673] ACPI: No ACPI bus support for 2-2:1.0
[   20.002417] usb 3-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and
address 2 [   20.121763] ACPI: No ACPI bus support for 3-2
[   20.156293] ACPI: No ACPI bus support for 3-2:1.0
[   29.539613] OK.
I also had this "problem" with mm1. mm2 wouldn't compile, so I didn't
test that. IIRC it also happened with the rc1-mm's. Is this supposed to
happen?
Attached is the full dmesg.
