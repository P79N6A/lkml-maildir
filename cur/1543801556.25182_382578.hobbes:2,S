IIRC, it was introduced in 2.4.25. Since I'm still running 2.4.22, and
since I also didn't need the 2.6 module_param() stuff, I just ripped it
out.

Not in the driver itself, of course, in rpl_ioctl.h and rpl_packet.h.

Yeah, it was just my personal preference. That, and the fact that I
don't know the build system very well, and the O_TARGET and the obj-y
couldn't have the same name. So I opted to make O_TARGET simply rpl.o.
Since the driver you ship in the ttyrpld tarball can only be built
modular, this doesn't affect you anyway :-)

That'd be great, thanks! A great deal of people are still running 2.4 on
their production servers, and no intention to upgrade anytime soon. If
it's not broken... :-)
Thanks for this tool, by the way, I for one find it very useful!
