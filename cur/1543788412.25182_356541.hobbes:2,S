Yes, in fact all my examples should have been for ->d_revalidate(),
since it's not possible that ->lookup() be called for a mounted
dentry.

No.  Only the namespace semaphore could protect against mount/umount,
but you don't want to take that in lookup logic.

I just think that filesystem code should _never_ need to care about
mounts.  If you want to do the lookup+open, you somehow will have to
deal with mounts, which is ugly.

IMO the lookup+open optimization is not valid, because dealing with
mounts is the job of the VFS and not the filesystem.
Path lookup usually ends in a sequence of ->lookup (or
->d_revalidate), then following mounts, then doing the operation.  You
shouldn't try to merge the ->lookup and the ->fsop into one operation.
That way leads to madness.
