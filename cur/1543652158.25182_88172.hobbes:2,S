Hello Andrea,
> So I believe either 1* or 2* patches are introducing the issue.
Got it. The 10_x86-fast-pte2 patch is introducting the instability.
I have tested it on 2.4.20rc1aa1 though, backing out that patch alone solves 
the instability.
I can give the .config and ksymoops of 2.4.20rc1aa1 if needed.

I will verify this finding even on that computer perhaps on Monday.
