There is a tool that does this quite well. Its called "gcc" ;)
More seriously we need to seperate "things Andrew thinks are good inline
candidates" and "things that *must* be inlined". That allows 'build for
size' to do the equivalent of "-Dplease_inline" and the other build to
do "-Dplease_inline=inline". Gcc's inliner isn't aware of things cross
module so isn't going to make all the decisions right, but will make the
tedious local decisions.
As far as bugs go - gcc -Os has also fixed bugs in the past. It doesn't
introduce bugs so much as change them. Fedora means we have good long
term data on -Os with modern gcc (not with old gcc but we just dumped <
3.2 anyway).
Nowdays the -Os code paths are also getting real hammering because many
people build desktops, even OpenOffice with -Os and see overall
performance gains for the system.
