Hi, 
I've had some recurring problems with kernel crashes on my RH 6.0 system,
kernel 2.2.5-15.  Here's the summary of the bug report I've sent to
redhat, BUG #3128
---------------------
Here's my system: i686, 128MB RAM, 136548k swap space.
kernel 2.2.5-15,  passing kernel flag "mem=128M".
When my swap space is exhausted, the machine simply stops. 
It's not thrashing- it just stops.  No mouse response, no
keyboard response, the HD LED is not on.
It's very difficult to collect any other diagnostics, but I
was watching 'top' as the machine ran out of memory and top
observed that the swap space remaining was 0k.

I should mention that I'm using the stock kernel from the redhat
distro. The following modules were resident:
Module                  Size  Used by
nfs                    29944   9  (autoclean)
lockd                  30856   1  (autoclean) [nfs]
sunrpc                 52356   1  (autoclean) [nfs lockd]
3c59x                  18920   1  (autoclean)
