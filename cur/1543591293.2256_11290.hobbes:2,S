Well, as that doesn't actually work out in practice, the good news is that
USB at least _tries_ to always walk the tree the same way when detecting
devices, so if you don't change where your devices are in the topologu
they should show up in similar places.
Of course, "not changing topology" also means things like not powering off
devices with external power supplies etc..
The serial numbers are probably not that reliable.
