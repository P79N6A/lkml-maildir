I am running complete 2.4.20rc1aa1 minus 10_x86-fast-pte-2 at present. It has 
been very stable as mainline plus as snappy as -aa :).
On a related note, I had to apply 20_rcu-poll-7 for compiling 10* patch(es) 
(even for the10_ext3-o_direct-2 patch), so would it be a good idea to move it 
as the earliest 10* patch?
Thanks.
