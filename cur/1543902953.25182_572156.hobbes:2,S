The missing context here is CONFIG_VMSPLIT on laptops.
Laptop users, who frequently use CONFIG_VMSPLIT options to avoid
highmem, wanted to turn on NX. Prior to the patch, those options were
barred for all highmem configurations. In response to those requests,
I produced the patch.
The overhead and instability derived from tiny zones as opposed to
kmap()/kunmap(), or at least such was the case historically.
