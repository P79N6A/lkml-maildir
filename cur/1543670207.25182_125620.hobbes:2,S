I'm running 2.5.67 on an otherwise mostly-RH9, and it works fine modulo the
usual issues with bleeding-edge kernels.  I've only hit two issues that are
at all redhat specific:
1) Get Rusty's module tools (but you knew that).  If you install them
right, they'll DTRT if you boot a 2.4 kernel too (keep the RH kernel
around just in case. ;)
2) You'll need this work-around for modules, probably:
