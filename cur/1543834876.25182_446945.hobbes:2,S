Subject: [PATCH] [fs] Add lock annotation to grab_super
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/26/241

grab_super gets called with sb_lock held, and releases it.  Add a lock
annotation to this function so that sparse can check callers for lock pairing,
and so that sparse will not complain about this function since it
intentionally uses the lock in this manner.
