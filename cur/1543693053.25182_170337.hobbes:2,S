Hi Andrew,
 Your third patch worked perfectly for all the tested cases:
    o /dev/mem at offset fd000000 (my video card mem addr)
    o /dev/mem at offset 0
    o with an mmapable device driver.
I did have to make two changes to get it to compile:

In the first change, 'special' != '(vma->vma_flags & VM_IO)' which
was what was originally being tested.  Could that cause a problem?
Also, could the use of VM_RESERVED cause in some cases memory with
pageframes to skip adjustment/use of those pageframes?
Regards, and thanks,
Joe
