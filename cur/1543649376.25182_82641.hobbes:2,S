I will agree. I will observe two details
	1. The wall normally wins
	2. Christoph is right
In the mean time it would really help if people took the EVMS/LVM2
debate down to the technical aspects not the marketing ones (at least on
this list). That means fixing the bugs, cleaning up the code, auditing
it etc.
The folks who want to have long rambling discussions rather than fix the
code or test it are encouraged to find a private brick wall, bartender
(or different list) to talk at
