Actually, the allocation that fills the partition (and goes one over)
should fail. Even if that is only adding a block to the hole, it should
fail. Now if it DOES continue then you have found a bug since it
shouldn't do that.

There is nothing wrong with the documentation. Though it could have
additions to more clearly explain why. The feature can already be disabled.
