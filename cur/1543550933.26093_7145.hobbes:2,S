info gcc ;) 
Declare a global register variable.
register struct task_struct current asm("REGNAME"); 
This has to be declared in all kernel files, so you may want to use
gcc's -include option in CFLAGS.
Another option would be to clean up the current uses and use a special
variant of current "interrupt_current". This would save some cycles
in the interrupt path.
