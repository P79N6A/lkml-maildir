Subject: [patchset] Fix mishandling of error/exit patchs in 2.5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Here's a patchset to fix error/exit paths in 2.5.  This is working off
Alan's list and are forward ports of 2.4 patches.  
Patches will follow for dpt_i2o, jffs, and es1371.
dpt_i2o patch is probably not maintained and doesn't compile with current bk
 -- but that is not because of this fix.  Other patches compile.
Thanks,
Kiran
