I think that is the wrong question.
This stuff is tricky. Especially when one has several operating systems
on a single disk some degree of control is required. Maybe you say
"in tricky cases use some other partition editor", but it seems
reasonable to offer users the opportunity to specify the desired
geometry.
Of course poor users will listen to the ignorant advice of their
neighbours and do all kinds of things to the geometry in attempts
to solve entirely unrelated problems. The number of support problems
will increase. So, try to supply accurate docs describing the cases
where changing the geometry may be useful, and warning that changing
the geometry may cause the loss of all data on the disk.
