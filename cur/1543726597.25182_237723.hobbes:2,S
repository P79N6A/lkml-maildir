During swsusp, you need to make devices quiet; you do not need them to
enter any particular D0..D3, you just want them not to do DMA and
interrupts.
During reboot, you do not need devices in any of D0..D3; you do not
care, as long as BIOS can work with the devices after the reboot.
I do not think I'm giving them wrong device-level state.

I do not think enough info can be fit into D0..D3.

PCI suspend routines need more detailed info than D0..D3. We do not
want global "int real_system_state" that devices look at...

See above, devices care what system is doing. For example you do not
want to spin down disks during "make it quiet for swsusp". And you
need to turn off apic before reboot, not because you want to save
power, but because bios crashes if you don't do that.

No problem with that.

Moving include should not be a problem... Changing all PCI
drivers... Ben H. claimed there's so little of them he can change them
all ;-).
