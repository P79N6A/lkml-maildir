Yup. Either the "do this" (see above) or the "&&" variant, though, the latter
can become quite nested or long.
[ In fact, if you have
  void function(struct something *arg)
  {
  	if (arg != NULL) {
  		lots_of_code;
  	}
  }
  it is perhaps better to write as
  {
  	if (arg == NULL)
  		return;
  	lots_of_code;
  }
  since that reduces the indent by at least one. ]
