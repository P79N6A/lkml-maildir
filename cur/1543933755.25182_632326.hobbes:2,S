Hi,
I applied your patches to 2.6.24-rc6-mm1, but now I am faced with one
pdflush often using 100% CPU for a long time. There seem to be some rare
pauses from its 100% usage, however.
On ~23 minutes uptime i have ~19 minutes pdflush runtime.
This is on E6600, x86_64, 2 Gig RAM, SATA HDD, running on gentoo ~x64_64
Let me know if you need more info.
Prost,
Sascha Warner
