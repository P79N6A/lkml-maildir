We don't have a stable work around yet.  Unwrapping the IOMMU startup
code is proving tricky.  The only thing I can think of is to change the
polarity of the intel-iommu command line to default to off, and if your
bios doesn't suck you can enable it if you want to use it.
I don't like this option much, since all the issues have been bios
based.  But, I don't know what else to do at this time.
