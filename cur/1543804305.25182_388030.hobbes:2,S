Well in isolate_lru_page, the test operation is actually optional
(ie. it is the conditional for a BUG). And I have plans for making
some of those configurable....
But at least on the G5, test_and_clear can be noticable (although
IIRC it was in the noise for _this_ articular case) because of the
memory barriers required.

Yes, I think Andrew did his homework. I thought it through quite a bit
before sending the patches and again after your feedback. Subtle though,
no doubt.

Hmm... this is what the de-skew patch _did_ (although it was wrapped
in a function called get_page_unless_zero), in fact the main aim was
to prevent this twiddling and the de-skewing was just a nice side effect
(I guess the patch title is misleading).
So I'm confused...

Don't worry, you'll be seeing that patch again -- it is required for
lockless pagecache.
