Well, in fact it is not needed in 2.6.24, because this patch correct a bad 
behavior introduced by commit 57f4e446ebca4aad5c11364baf8477c8cfcb16a4 (which is 
not in kvm-update-2.6.24):
KVM: Call x86_decode_insn() only when needed
Move emulate_ctxt to kvm_vcpu to keep emulate context when we exit from kvm
module. Call x86_decode_insn() only when needed. Modify x86_emulate_insn() to
not modify the context if it must be re-entered.
So, in fact, the answer is (after correctly understanding the question): no, 
this patch is not needed in kvm-update-2.6.24.
Regards,
Laurent
