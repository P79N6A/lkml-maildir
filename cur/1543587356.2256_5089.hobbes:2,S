Hi
Regarding the patch ....
I don't have experience with the linux kernel internals but could this patch 
not lead to a run-loop condition as the only thing that can break our of the 
for(;;) loop is the tmp==&dentry_unused statement. So if the required number 
of dentries does not exist and this condition is not satisfied we would have 
an infinate loop... sorry if this is a silly question.
Also the comment >/* If the dentry was recently referenced, don't free it. 
*/<, the code inside is excuted if the DCACHE_REFERENCED flags are set and in 
the code is is reversing the DCACHE_REFERENCED flag on the dentry and adding 
it to the dentry_unsed list??? So a Refrenched entry is set Not Referenced 
and place in the unsed list?? I am unclear about that... is the comment 
correct or is my understanding lacking (which is very probable :-))..
TIA

                struct list_head *tmp;
 
                tmp = dentry_unused.prev;
 
                if (tmp == &dentry_unused)
                        break;
                list_del_init(tmp);
                dentry = list_entry(tmp, struct dentry, d_lru);
 
                /* If the dentry was recently referenced, don't free it. */
                if (dentry->d_flags & DCACHE_REFERENCED) {
                        dentry->d_flags &= ~DCACHE_REFERENCED;
                        list_add(&dentry->d_lru, &dentry_unused);
                        continue;
                }
                dentry_stat.nr_unused--;
