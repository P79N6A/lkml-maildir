I saw today that if you type SYSRQ+? I get the all the options, but
anything that I type afterwards it says that message again, is this the
way it should act? I could not do anything else on the console..
----
alt+sys + any_key_that_is_not_in_the_list_print_the_list_of_option
eg: alt+sys+space
However, due to a bug, the keyboard keep in sysrq mode after this in
recent kernels (say the last ten)
Only retype alt+sys to return in normal mode....
Someone want to fix it?
