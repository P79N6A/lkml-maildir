What's even more interesting is the following:
tux:/usr/src/linux-2.6.0-test3 # grep -r "CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT" *
arch/i386/defconfig:CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT=7
arch/x86_64/defconfig:CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT=6
include/asm-x86_64/cache.h:#define L1_CACHE_SHIFT 
(CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT)
include/linux/autoconf.h:#define CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT 5
include/asm-i386/cache.h:#define L1_CACHE_SHIFT (CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT)
include/asm/cache.h:#define L1_CACHE_SHIFT      (CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT)
include/config/x86/l1/cache/shift.h:#define CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT 5
tux:/usr/src/linux-2.6.0-test3 #
Life sure is interesting.
Cheers,
