The goal here is to replace the head of a existing list pointed to by
'list' with a new head pointed to by 'nlist'. 
First there is a memcpy that copies the contents of list to nlist then
this macro is called.
The macro makes sure that if the old head was empty then INIT_LIST_HEAD
the 'nlist', if not then make sure that the nodes before and after the
head now correclty point to nlist instead of list.
