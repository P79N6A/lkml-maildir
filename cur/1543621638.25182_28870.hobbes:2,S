Normal users can create and use IPX sockets. They just can't make
'servers'. If normal users need to make servers, make the executible
suid,  get the code root privs for an instant, then revert
back. Warning. A network server of any kind can be exploited. At
the very least, it can be used for DOS attacks.

    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
