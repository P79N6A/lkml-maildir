I know. I never said there was one. I said, that the local APIC is used
for timer interupts - at least, this is how I interpret
Using local APIC timer interrupts.
calibrating APIC timer ...
Am I missing anything trivial?

Yes, I saw this your explanation. Thanks again. But, I am not getting
those errors with local APIC disabled. That's why I thought "local APIC ->
timer -> spurious interrupts." Maybe I am wrong. But I also can't see how
enabling the lapic can cause, e.g., power supply glitches to become
visible. I would be happy and grateful to hear an explanation.
Thanks
