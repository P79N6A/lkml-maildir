Hi erich and other interested parties,
I agree with Theodore that it would be a great idea to get the arcmsr
driver and I'm sure we'd all be happy to help you with whatever you need
to make this happen.
Is any of the technical hardware documentation available to us so we can
help you with the driver design?  I'm certainly happy to help with
testing and/or documentation, and I have some C programming skills,
though I haven't done any serious kernel programming.
Regards,
Bron.
