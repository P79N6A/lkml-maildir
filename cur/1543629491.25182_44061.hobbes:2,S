All versions of depmod for 2.4 have always returned errors for invalid
objects in /lib/modules, that check has not changed since modutils
2.4.0.  modutils has not changed, somebody is storing extra text files
in /lib/modules without telling modutils.  Don't do that.
Who created the ksyms and soundconf files?  If they come from some
distribution script, does that distributor ship a modified version of
modutils to ignore the extra files, without telling me?  If so, which
distributor do I have to kill?
