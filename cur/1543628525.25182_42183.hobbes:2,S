I have unofficial confirmation from Intel that the way to architecturally
initialize the FPU state is indeed something like
        memset(&fxsave, 0, sizeof(struct i387_fxsave_struct));
        fxsave.cwd = 0x37f;
        fxsave.mxcsr = 0x1f80;
        fxrstor(&fxsave);
and the person in question is trying to make sure this is documented so
that we won't be bitten by this in the future.
