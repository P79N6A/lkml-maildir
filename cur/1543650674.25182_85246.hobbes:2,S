I don't apply the patches for possible incompatibility with Compaq Remote
Insight Manager card, the drivers of this card are for 2.4.7
(
http://www.compaq.com/support/files/server/us/download/15084.html
). Now I'm
trying to make one upgrade to 2.4.18 recompiling the drivers source...  Why
happen this errors in 2.4.7?
Best regards,
-Adriano (bryam)
