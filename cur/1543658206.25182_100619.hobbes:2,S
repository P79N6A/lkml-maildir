You are reporting problems in 2.4.20. 2.4.20 doesn't have the revamped IDE...
The IDE is getting updated because
- Lots of new controllers dont work with the old code
- Lots of LBA48 problems exist with the older code
- SATA is right out with the older code
- Several existing controllers have weird bugs with the older code
I'd much prefer we didn't have to update the IDE too 8)
