So, ext4_sync_file() calls blkdev_issue_flush() which would should do
the right thing even if the drive is spun down, I think (rather than
hoping that some other journal activity would flush this out...)
I guess I don't know for sure what blkdev_issue_flush does on a
spun-down drive but I'd hope it does the right thing.
Pretty sure I sent a patch for ext3 to do the same, but it was
ignored/dropped/forgotten along with the barriers-by-default patch.
Suppose I could try again.
