A requirement that is not needed is called a limitation.

I might but I don't, and so I am not happy to be imposed limitations 
I donnot deserve to suffer of.

I donnot have to remember for that point.
Btw, there is some parts in the kernel that seem not to care enough about
the virtual/physical issue, in my opinion.

Indeed, that is the issue. The ll_rw_blk thing and the current kernel
interfaces with IO sub-systems are the problems.
Your raw-io implementation is fine with regards to exiting kernel
interfaces. Thanks again for this very interesting feature.
