This is getting interesting. The tar archive contains a kernel source
tree (looks like 2.4.26). This kernel source tree contains the directory:
linux-2.4.x/drivers/net/wireless/inpro2220
Within this directory there's the file IPN2220 which is a mips object
file, so this is a binary only driver.
Now, even if this is built as a module the module "source" is imported
in the kernel source tree, i.e. it is not separate from the kernel
source. IMHO I do see this then as a GPL violation that goes beyond the
Linus tolerated level.
