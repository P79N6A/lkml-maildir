For bulk read() and write() I/O the best sized buffer is 8 kbytes.  4k is
pretty good, too.  Anything larger blows the user-side buffer out of L1.
This is for x86.
This is a pretty important point, so let's repeat it:
Userspace programmers who are writing bulk-transfer read/write loops
should use an 8 kbyte transfer buffer.

hmm.  Why is O_DIRECT always the slowest?  (and it would presumably do
even worse with an 8k transfer size).
