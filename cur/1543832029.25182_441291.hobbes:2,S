Ok, here's a rewrite of the mini.config patch that's just a makefile tweak to 
add the "make miniconfig" target, the miniconfig generator script, and some 
documentation.  No C code is touched by this patch series.
At some point I'd like to replace the guts of scripts/shrinkconfig with 
internal changes to kconfig that spit out a mini.config directly.  The script 
shrinks the current defconfig from 1584 lines to 116, but it takes 28 minutes 
to do so on my laptop.  However, in the past six months I haven't gotten 
around to tackling that and it won't creep up my to-do list sitting 
unsubmitted on my hard drive, so...
