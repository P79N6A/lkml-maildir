: confusion as to what state Linux for IA-64 (and Merced) is in.

: but as usual in a free software
: project, everybody who can contribute is welcome to do so.  
There is one point which perhaps should be made more clear:  if you are 
under NDA for IA-64 and you want to help with the IA-64 port, then you 
should contact David and coordinate with him.  Just because you don't work
at the same company doesn't mean you can't talk to each other about this
port.  I know of at least 4 companies who are all NDA'd on IA-64 and are 
all doing work on it and may or may not be talking to each other.  If you
are interested in contacts and have IA-64 NDA, let me know, I can put you 
in touch with the people inside the other companies.
