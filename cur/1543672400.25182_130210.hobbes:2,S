Thanks for the details,
But I would like to know when each FS is being accessed, and by which application. Isnt there a single path, say something in the driver code, from where all write/read commands pass? So that we can have a function call from that place, and create a log? 
And also, how do I create a logfile on my own. With my own function within the kernel. I dont wish to go to Userland and do the write process.
Thanks in advance.
Sumit
