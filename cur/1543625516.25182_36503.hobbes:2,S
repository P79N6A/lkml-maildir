Maybe you are right.
I tested a 2.5 kernel with another server with scsi adaptec, and
it worked with ext2 but oops while mounting reiserFS.
It seems that a lot of users had oops mounting reiserFS with 2.5.6, but
then a patch fixed that. Now I think this patch is in 2.5.7, (it should),
but there are other changes i think to reiserFS code. So i have other
oopses.
I think this could be a proof of a reiserFS bug.
If people at namesys need it (maybe they already know this, and have a
patch to try), tomorrow i will post the oop mounting
reiserFS.
