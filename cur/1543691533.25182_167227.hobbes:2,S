Much better. I presumed something like nvidia. Now that that's cleared
up, I'll have to find time to take a breather and peek at the vmware bits
to see if they're doing anything that might get misunderstood by the VM.
One thing to look for in vmware if you have the time/motivation
yourself is to check for dirty bits getting left in (or put into) non-
present ptes; this clashes with _PTE_FILE on i386.
