I have a question regarding line discipline:
in 
http://www.linux.it/~rubini/docs/serial/serial.html
 is shown data flow for Linux tty driver.
When it's necessary to use line discipline in tty driver (to call ldisc.write(), ldisc.read(), ldisc.receive_buf()) and when I can ignore line discipline in my tty driver? 
Thanks
