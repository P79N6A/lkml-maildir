Hi,
For quite some time now, I have "Neighbour table overflow." on
one of our router (serving more than 1000 boxes).
A bunch of google search gave me to answer :
1 - playing with /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/default/gc_thres*
2 - configure CONFIG_ARPD and find an user-space arp daemon.
Can any of you guys give more explanations on both solutions?
Mainly : 
- what are sane value for 1),
- is 2 really a "sane" solution (from Configure.help :
"This code is experimental and also obsolete").
Thanks,
	Fab
