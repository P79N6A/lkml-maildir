Subject: [patch 17/20] x86_64: Change PMDS invocation to single macro
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Andi Kleen <ak@suse.de>
Very old binutils (2.12.90...) seem to have trouble with newlines
in assembler macro invocation. They put them into the resulting
argument expansion. In this case this lead to a parse error because
a .rept expression ended up spread over multiple lines. Change the PMDS()
invocation to a single line.
