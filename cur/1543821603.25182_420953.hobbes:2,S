Let's see:  System V [4.2MP] back in the days of USL [Unix Systems Labs]
did this, as did [does] Digital/Compaq/HP Tru64 on alpha.  I'm not sure
if the latter came from the original Mach/OSF code or from Bob Picco's
rewrite thereof back in the 90's.

True, you still have locate the protection range in the subtree and then
still walk the page tables to install the new protections.  Of course,
in the bad old days, the only time I saw thousands or 10s of thousands
of different mappings/vmas/regions/whatever was in vm stress tests.
Until squid came along, that is.  Then we encountered, on large memory
alpha systems, 100s of thousands of mmaped files.  Had to replace the
linear [honest] vma/mapping list at that point ;-).

Yeah.  That was the point--in response to Nick's comment about the
disconnect betwen the protections as reported by the vma and the actual
pte protections.
