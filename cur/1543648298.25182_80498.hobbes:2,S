Which people didn't like it?  ;-)
AFAIK Linus and Al Viro (and myself <g>) have always considered ioctls 
an ugly -ism that should have never made it into Unix.  Over and above 
the Unix/VFS design problems with ioctl(2), ioctl(2) is a pain for 
people like David Miller who must maintain 32<->64 bit ioctl translation 
layers for their architecture.  ia64 and x64-64 must do this too.  Each 
ioctl you add is an additional headache for them.
We now have libfs.c in 2.5.x that makes ramfs-based filesystems even 
more tiny, too.  With the added flexibility of an fs -- it makes the 
userland tools much more simple and sane -- and the pain of ioctls, it 
seems a clear choice for new interfaces.
