Hello,
	i'm having some random hangs in a Satellite Pro 4600, mostly when
the laptop is idle (it seems to be related to apm/pcmcia yenta socket...) 
and i found your message ...
	now, about your problem: try the alsa-modules and you won't regret
it. the i810 drivers that are in stock linux kernel seem to be a bit
braindead ... dunno  if it fixes since altough i can get my wavelan card
to work i don't use it often to connect to the network but instead the
bultin e100 card...oh, and i also use the driver from intel for this
one not the one in the kernel...
	right now i'm using kernel 2.4.17
