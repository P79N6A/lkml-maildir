This is only true for workloads that are parallelizable. I don't think
any kernel is quite good enough to divine what a single-threaded
userland application is doing and make its work parallel.
That is to say, if we are going to look at examples (and so we should),
then we need to pick an example that is actually expected to benefit
from many-processor machines.
