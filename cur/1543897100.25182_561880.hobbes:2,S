I am using the "ip add " command looping sequentially up until RTNETLINK 
starts refusing to add more IP addresses. I am using a simple shell 
script to do the trick. One quick fact : If I exhaust 4K addresses on 
one port , then I can not add more IP's  ( v4/v6 alike ) on any port on 
the system. So seems like its a system wide limitation . Tried digging 
through the kernel source code but no luck so far. So definitely need 
pointers in this regard.
How are you adding via Netlink interface ?
Thanks,
