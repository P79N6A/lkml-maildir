I think that they are diagnostic messages that are a result of an old
disk not supporting some new commands that are being send to it.  I
thought this was done silently in the 2.4.x series - I see it on some
really old, (100 MB) disks running 2.5.x
I _think_ you can safely ignore it, but I am CCing Alan, because he
will know for certain.

Are they all of a similar age/capacity?

What is the exact problem?
John.
