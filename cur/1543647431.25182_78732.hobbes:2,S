I've applied patch sent by Marcelo (below) (by hand since it fails with
patch -p0)  and now I'm able to boot 2.4.19pre3. The result of this
testing is that this kernel has the bug too, so IMHO this bug/feature was
introduced between 2.4.19pre2 and 2.4.19pre3.
Any other patch/idea which should I try?
Thanks a lot,
Karel
