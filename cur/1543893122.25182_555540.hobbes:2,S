Hmm, how's 2.6.22-rc4-mm2 doing on the Vaio?
There are a couple of patches in there that might help in theory, this series
in particular:
swsusp-remove-incorrect-code-from-userc.patch
swsusp-remove-code-duplication-between-diskc-and-userc.patch
swsusp-introduce-restore-platform-operations.patch
swsusp-fix-hibernation-code-ordering.patch
swsusp-remove-code-duplication-between-diskc-and-userc-fix.patch
Greetings,
Rafael
