Hello Con,
I have your ck5_2.4.19.patch with some additional stuff running fine on my 
dual Athlon MP 1900+, MSI K7D Master-L, 1 GB DDR-SDRAM 266 CL.
ck5 + some 2.4.19-jam0 stuff (Andrea, Ingo, others)
000_e100-2.1.6 (-AA)
000_e1000-4.3.2 (-AA)
00_387-fix-1
10-module-size-checks
12-memparam
24-config-nr_cpus
30-smptimers-A0
30_irq-balance-12
31-nr_requests
70-i2c-2.6.4
71-sensors-2.6.4
2.4.19.pending ReiserFS stuff
linux-2.4.19-ntfs-2.1.0a.patch
page_color-2.4.19-pre10-1 (Page coloring)
I'm from Robert Love's "side" and have his stuff running on top of 2.4 for 
nearly one year, now.
The first bench I try is latencytest-0.42-png all the time.

Then I try dbench (Yes, I know Rik ;-) to see the GREAT speed of Andrea 
Arcangeli's -AA VM which improve noticeably with the Preemption patch.
O(1) gave some additional speed, too.
What about Robert's nice Preemption Latency Measurement Tool?

I tried it many times to gave Robert some feedback.
Regards and good work!
