Here's an example code sequence that demonstrates how a setuid-to-root
application could drop all capabilities except for CAP_IPC_LOCK and
then run with the non-privileged uid:
    #include <sys/prctl.h>
    #include <sys/capability.h>
	...
	cap_t c;
	if (prctl(PR_SET_KEEPCAPS, 1UL, 0UL, 0UL, 0UL) < 0 ||
	    seteuid(getuid()) < 0 ||
	    !(c = cap_from_text("cap_ipc_lock=eip")) ||
	    cap_set_proc(c) < 0)
		/* handle error */;
However, I agree that it's often not viable to require application
changes to achieve the desired result.
Cheers.  -ernie
