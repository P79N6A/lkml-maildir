My (limited) understanding is that they /should/ (i.e., according to theory)
be able to, but that they might not /ought/ to (i.e., what the kernel
actually supports).  I've been meaning to get another ide cable anyway.  :-)

No ERRs at all here.
I am beginning to notice a pattern:  if the system is soft-rebooted, the
errors in my oridinal email almost always occur during the boot sequence
(which either hangs the system, or OOPSes the kernel).  Driving over to
that building, reaching down and pushing the reset button hasn't (yet) had
a problem.  I'll try to keep notes during the upcoming inevitable crashes.
