Subject: Linux 2.2.5 won't boot?

I ran into a VERY strange problem. I have an AMD 486DX4/100 on an MG
motherboard. The problem is that Linux refuses to boot without a
monitor connected. LILO loads up the kernel, but it hangs after
"booting the kernel..." until I connect a monitor. With a monitor
connected the system boots up fine.
I tested with two different S3 Trio64 PCI video adapters and I
compiled the kernel without console support and with serial console
enabled, but it still won't boot. It won't boot without a video card
either. Judging by the beeps and sounds the box makes LILO still
loads the kernel. I'm going to try it with a Trident ISA card later
and see if that helps.
Anyone got any advice?
