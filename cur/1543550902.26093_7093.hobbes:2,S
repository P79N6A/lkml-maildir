I've been touring around the kernel sources when I stumbled
across the uid_hash_find() function (kernel/user.c):
static inline struct user_struct *uid_hash_find(unsigned short uid, unsigned int hashent)
{
	struct user_struct *up, *next;
 
	next = uidhash[hashent];
	for (;;) {
		up = next;
		if (next) {
			next = up->next;
			if (up->uid != uid)
				continue;
			atomic_inc(&up->__count);
 		}
		break;
	}
	return up;
}
Now, it took me some time to figure out how this function 
behaves, and I came into conclusion that the implementation 
is not only an unreadable piece of code, but also inefficient. 
Give one reason why we shouldn't use this:
static inline struct user_struct *uid_hash_find(unsigned short uid, unsigned int hashent)
{
	struct user_struct *up;
 
	for (up = uidhash[hashent]; up ; up = up->next)
		if (up->uid == uid)
		{
			atomic_inc(&up->__count);
			return up;
 		}
	return NULL;
}
[compiled, booted, and it works fine]
