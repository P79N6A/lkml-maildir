This is just the UDP control connection, the data is not copied
or scanned. Feel free to send a patch that doesn't need to
copy linear skbs and doesn't need to modify the skb.

non-linear skb have fragments scattered in memory, you have to
copy them or scan with a function that is aware of how the data
is layed out in memory. Look at Harald's notes from the netfilter
workshop for details on current work in this area.
