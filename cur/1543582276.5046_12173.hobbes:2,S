Hi,
   in my laptop (HP 4150B) I upgraded from a 12GB IBM Travelstar to an
20GB IBM Travelstar (both 4200rpm). After the upgrade I moved also to
2.4.2-pre3 and reiserfs. However, the problem I now have is that after
resume I get the message "hda: lost interrupt" and the only thing to do
is to reset the machine (in the only good thing is that reiserfs saved
me a lot of fsck time).
Any idea what the problem might be? Is the larger disk not supported by
the BIOS (it is recognized properly). People mentioned not to use DMA
anymore?
With 2.2.18 and the 12GB disk there were never problems (except that the
disk got bad blocks ;-().
My IDE setup in .config is below.
Cheers, Fons.
