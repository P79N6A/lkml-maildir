This draws a misleading picture. A member of a kset shows up where the
"parent" pointer points to. Like /sys/block is a kset, the kset contains
disks and partitions, but partitions do not live at the kset, and tons
of other kset directories where this is the case.
"If the kobject belonging to a kset has no parent kobject set, it will
be added to the kset's directory. Not all members of a kset do
necessarily live in the kset directory. If an explicit parent kobject is
assigned before the kobject is added, the kobject is registered with the
kset, but added below the parent kobject."

Yeah, it's the type, not the set.

It's by far not "almost all cases". Can we please drop that? It's very
common that kobjects are a member of a kset but have a different parent.

I think, we should remove all these default events from the kobject
core. We will not be able to manage the timing issues and "raw" kobject
users should request the events on their own, when they are finished
adding stuff to the kobject. I see currently no way to solve the
"attributes created after the event" problem. The new
*_create_and_register functions do not allow default attributes to be
created, which will just lead to serious trouble when someone wants to
use udev to set defaults and such things. We may just want to require an
explicit call to send the event?
Thanks,
