Ingo,
Is it possible that queue_task() handlers in earlier driver code may have
depended on implicit serialization against corresponding timer handlers since
each of those is run from BHs ? If so, isn't that an issue now with
no BHs ? Or, is it safe to assume that general smp-safety code in the
drivers will take care of serialization between timers and work-queues ?
Thanks
