Or at the very least, to selectively not compile large chunks of stuff
that went in that I will never need. Stuff that isn't there on libc5
and other Unices. Something that takes up less than half a floppy.
And having source and binary compatibility between major releases
wouldn't hurt either!

Yep. Having to allocate/search for a device structure during open(2)
is insane. It's wasteful. For ext2fs you can do it in lookup(), and
for devfs (or similar) you can do the ideal thing: when the device
entry is registered with the FS (i.e. only once).
