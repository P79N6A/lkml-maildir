Hello.
I've got a question about function register_chrdev in
/usr/src/linux/fs/devices.c file.
In line 135 of the function register_chrdev 
there is a logical operator &&:
if(chrdevs[major].fops && chrdevs[major].fops != fops)
                       ^^ 
Is it supposed to be a bitwise operator &? Am I correct?    
Thank you.
Sincerely,
          K.V.P
