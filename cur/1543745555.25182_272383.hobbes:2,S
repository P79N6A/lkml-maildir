Make hostfs use the generic sendfile implementation. As you can see, the
problem was simply that it was forgot to set hostfs_file_fops.sendfile to
point to it. I've got one report that it works, and since hostfs uses the VFS
cache it seems reasonable. However, can somebody confirm this?
Also, is there anything spotting similar treatment?
