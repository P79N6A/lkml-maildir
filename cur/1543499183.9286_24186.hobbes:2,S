Because they don't work. In Ye Olde Days, you had your getty(8) listen
on ttyS*, you did your callout on cua*, and the kernel did the locking
between the two.
That idea breaks like <insert_appropriate_comparison_here> when you try to
use mgetty to listen for calls, because it waits for RING and sends ATA and
waits for CONNECT and only _then_ you'll get a DCD signal.
Anyway, the default setting for ttyS* includes CLOCAL, so if all your
serial-abusing programs leave the port in the state they found it there
shouldn't be any problem in the first place.

That's not a fix. For one, you'll get problems with locking.
