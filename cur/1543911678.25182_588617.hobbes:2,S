I think the original reasoning behind kcalloc() was that it did some  
extra input checking, so that if the product of the two numbers  
overflowed, it would fail with NULL instead of allocating  
insufficient space.  In the kernel it doesn't matter in practice  
since you MUST have additional checking on the size of allocated  
memory anyways, not even considering the fact that >PAGE_SIZE  
allocations are probably going to fail with decent frequency regardless.
