DMI_PRODUCT_NAME is number of field in DMI tables containing product
name, it is a number and can't be upcased ;)

It was considered but we decided that if we need to rely on solely DMI
data when activating some features we need to add models one by one
and do not use "blanket" options. There are lifebooks out there that
do not have that kind of outscreen so if we tried to match just on
"LIFEBOOK" present in the product name we might hit such models and
then their PS/2 mice would not work.
If we knew of a way to query the touchscreen for lifebook protocol
support that would be a different story...
