Just to report that similar tests on three machines have each run
for 20 hours so far without any such infinite loop reoccurring.
Well, I broke off the x86_64 for a couple of hours: wondered if I'd got
confused, forgotten to "rmmod ext2" at one stage, and saw that behaviour
with my simple "ext2fs_blk_t ret_block" patch, rather than your more
extensive patch to ext2_new_blocks() that I'd believed I was testing.
I didn't give it long enough to be conclusive, but the problem didn't
show up with that either, so I've gone back to testing with yours.
I'd have kept the hang around for longer if I'd guessed it would be
hard to reproduce, and that it would be puzzling even to you: sorry.
kdb is in, if it comes again I can peer at it more closely.
