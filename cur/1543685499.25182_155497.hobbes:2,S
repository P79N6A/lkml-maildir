cron is user setable. Just set it to work at a time you aren't there.

Again, cron is not something inevitable that you cant control. If you're 
mixing sound, dont run cron at times where it can interfere with your 
work. Cron is a throughput intensive process.  Complaining about 
processes like cron is like complaining about how your audio is skipping 
while running hdparm -t on the drive or dbench.

the problem is you want a process that works like it was run on a single 
tasking OS on an operating system that is built from the ground up to be 
  a multi-user multi-tasking OS and you want both to work perfectly at 
peak performance and you want it to know when you want which to work at 
peak performance automatically.
Duct tape cant do that, because just about nothing can. You're gonna 
have to make some effort as a user to do the job because short of 
artificial intelligence, the schedular is never going to be good enough 
for everyone to always be happy with heuristics or not.
Tune and optimize the schedular to handle problems with latency within 
like-processes and throughput within like-processes and allow priority 
levels to take care of how they work together. There is always room to 
optimize the code without changing what it eventually does too, in that 
way the schedular can be improved without exchanging it for something 
else whenever a problem occurs or allowing it to be directed by a 
specific group of loud users and set of userspace programs.
I'd just like to see less complication because less is faster and faster 
means less overhead in kernel time.  If i have to do some of the work 
that a bloated artificially intelligent schedular will do then i'm more 
than happy to because that system is going to be able to scale much 
better than something with complicated scheduling as the number of 
processes increases.
