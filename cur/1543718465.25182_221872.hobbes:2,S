It would help me a lot if you changed your email subject line in two 
minor ways:
1) Include the kernel version _inside_ the brackets,
	[PATCH 1/5 2.4.27-pre3]
2) Just to make it look a tad nicer and more consistent with other 
changelog entries, add a colon after the driver name:
	[PATCH 1/5 2.6.6] pcnet32: mark two routines static
This allows me to pass your submission fully automated through scripts. 
  The resultant one-line description of your patch becomes
	[PATCH] pcnet32: mark two routines static
when my scripts merge your patch into the BK repository.
BTW, you don't need to resend your 2.4 and 2.6 pcnet32 patches, this is 
just for future reference.

P.S.  Somebody should put this into Documentation/SubmittingPatches...
