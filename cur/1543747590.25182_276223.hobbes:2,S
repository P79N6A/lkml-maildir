	I do not understand. The _IOW() macro just uses sizeof(_third_argument)
both on 2.4 and 2.6. And nothing else than sizeof() is done with the third
argument of _IOW(). So it does not matter what you put into the third
argument anyway, provided that you make sure the ABI (i.e. the type
and layout of the last argument to ioctl()) remains the same. The third
argument to _IOW() is just a (rather weak) helper which helps you to detect
the unwanted ABI change.
	Yes, I made a (small) mistake when writing cosa.h during the
Linux 2.1 development cycle, but since nobody cared and I am pretty
sure I did not change the layout of struct cosa_download at all since
Linux 2.1, I would rather have the 2.6 ioctl numbers the same
as in 2.1-2.4.
