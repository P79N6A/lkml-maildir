Every little factor of 25 performance increase really helps.
Ramback is a new virtual device with the ability to back a ramdisk
by a real disk, obtaining the performance level of a ramdisk but with
the data durability of a hard disk.  To work this magic, ramback needs
a little help from a UPS.  In a typical test, ramback reduced a 25
second file operation[1] to under one second including sync.  Even
greater gains are possible for seek-intensive applications.
The difference between ramback and an ordinary ramdisk is: when the 
machine powers down the data does not vanish because it is continuously 
saved to backing store.  When line power returns, the backing store
repopulates the ramdisk while allowing application io to proceed 
concurrently.  Once fully populated, a little green light winks on and 
file operations once again run at ramdisk speed.
So now you can ask some hard questions: what if the power goes out 
completely or the host crashes or something else goes wrong while 
critical data is still in the ramdisk?  Easy: use reliable components.  
Don't crash.  Measure your UPS window.  This is not much to ask in 
order to transform your mild mannered hard disk into a raging superdisk 
able to leap tall benchmarks at a single bound.
If line power goes out while ramback is running, the UPS kicks in and a 
power management script switches the driver from writeback to 
writethrough mode.  Ramback proceeds to save all remaining dirty data 
while forcing each new application write through to backing store 
immediately.
If UPS power runs out while ramback still holds unflushed dirty data 
then things get ugly.  Hopefully a fsck -f will be able to pull 
something useful out of the mess.  (This is where you might want to be 
running Ext3.)  The name of the game is to install sufficient UPS power 
to get your dirty ramdisk data onto stable storage this time, every 
time.
The basic design premise of ramback is alluringly simple: each write to 
a ramdisk sets a per-chunk dirty bit.  A kernel daemon continuously 
scans for and flushes dirty chunks to backing store.  It sounds easy, 
but in practice a number of additional requirements increase the design 
complexity considerably:
 * Previously saved data must be reloaded into the ramdisk on startup.
 * Applications need to be able to read and write ramback data during
   initial loading.
 * If line power is restored before the battery runs out then ramdisk
   level performance should resume immediately.
 * Applications data should continue to be available and writable even
   during emergency data flushing.
 * Racy application writes should not be able to cause the contents of
   backing store to diverge from the contents of the ramdisk.
 * If UPS power is limited then maximum dirty data must be limited as 
   well, so that power does not run out while dirty data remains.
 * Cannot transfer directly between ramdisk and backing store, so must 
   first transfer into memory then relaunch to destination.
 * Cannot submit a transfer directly from completion interrupt, so a 
   helper daemon is needed.
 * Per chunk locking is not feasible for a terabyte scale ramdisk.
In addition, there are two nasty races to consider:
 1) Populate race
    A chunk dirtied by an application write may be overwritten by a 
    chunk simultaneously read from backing store during initial populate
 2) Flush race
    A dirty chunk flush must not overwrite an application write.  Even 
    though applications IO always goes to the ramdisk, in flush mode the
    resulting writethrough transfer may overtake a previously launched 
    dirty chunk flush and stale data will land in backing store.  Also,
    so that the backing store always has exactly the contents of the
    ramdisk for each completed write, we would like to preserve
    application write order for overlapping writes, even though this can
    only happen with a racy application.
To give some sense of the resulting complexity, here is the algorithm I 
implemented to close the writethrough race:
   Write algorithm when in writethrough mode
   Kick writethrough:
      If writethrough queue empty, done
      If head of writethrough queue does not overlap any member of
      storing list
         Remove head from writethrough queue, add to storing list
         and submit
      (else it will be submitted when save completes)
   On application write in writethrough mode: (after populating)
      Mark region clean
      Add to tail of writethrough queue
      Kick writethrough
   On save complete:
      Remove from storing list
      Kick writethrough
   On writethrough complete:
      Remove from storing list
      Kick writethrough
      Endio on original write
   On daemon finding a dirty chunk:
      Mark chunk clean and add to storing list
      submit it
For the most part, ramback just solves a classic cache consistency
problem.  As such, some of the techniques will be familiar to vm
hackers, such as clearing the chunk dirty bit immediately on placing
dirty data under writeout, and keeping track of inflight dirty data
separately.  There are significant differences as well, but this post
is already long so I will save these details for later.
What Works Now:
  * Ramdisk populates from backing store when created.
  * Application io allowed during initial populating.
  * Application io allowed during flush on line power loss.
  * Populate vs application write race closed in theory.
  * Flush vs application writethrough race closed in theory.
  * Writethrough mode on line power loss apparently working.
  * Proc interface controls writeback vs writethrough mode.
  * Proc interface displays useful status.
Corners Cut in the Interest of Releasing Early:
  * Simple linear bitmap scan costs too much cpu.
  * Linear algorithms for list searching will not scale.
  * Could use atomic ops instead of spinlocks in places.
  * Should load and save range instead of single chunks.
  * Serializing all writes in writethrough mode is overkill.
  * Introduce populate vs application write balancing.
  * Introduce flush vs application writethrough balancing.
  * Handle chunk size other than PAGE_SIZE.
  * Handle noninteger number of chunks.
  * Too much cut and paste bio code.
Bugs:
  * Oops on dmsetup remove.
  * Buggy spinlocks, so no smp for now.
  * Block layer anti deadlock measures needed.
  * Writeback transfers sometimes starve application writes.
  * Backing disk is sometimes idle while populating.
  * Ramdisk chunks sometimes stay dirty forever.
  * Undoubtedly more under the rug...
Plea for help:
This driver is ready to try for a sufficiently brave developer.  It will 
deadlock and livelock in various ways and you will have to reboot to 
remove it.  But it can already be coaxed into running well enough for 
benchmarks, and when it solidifies it will be pretty darn amazing.  
Note that massive amounts of tracing output can be enabled or disabled, 
very handy for finding out how it tied itself in a knot.
  * If you would like to carve your name in this driver, please send me
    a bug fix.
  * If you would like to carve your name in the man page, please send an
    oops or SysRq backtrace to lkml so somebody can send me a bug fix.
  * Please send beer for no reason at all.
Many thanks to Violin Memory[2] who inspired and supported the ramback 
effort.  Can you guess why they are interested in stable backing store
for large ramdisks?

------------------
Create a ramback with chunksize 1<<12 (only size supported for now):
   echo 0 100 ramback /dev/ramdev /dev/backdev | dmsetup create <name>
Set ramback to flush mode:
  echo 1 >/proc/driver/ramback/<devname>
Set ramback to normal mode:
  echo 0 >/proc/driver/ramback/<devname>
Turn trace output on:
  echo 256 >/proc/driver/ramback/<devname>
Show ramback status:
  cat /proc/driver/ramback/<devname>
Progress monitor:
  watch -n1 cat /proc/driver/ramback/<devname>
Patch applies to 2.6.23.12:
  cd linux-2.6.23.12 && cat this.mail >patch -p1
A note on device mapper target names:
  There is actually no way for a device mapper target to obtain its
  own name, which is apparently by design, because each device mapper
  device is actually a table of devices and the name of an individual
  target would have to include something to distinguish it from other
  targets belonging to the same virtual device.  This is actually just
  a symptom of deep design flaws in device mapper.  For today, ramback
  uses the ascii address of its struct dm_target as its own name.  If
  you only have one this will not be a problem, but something really
  needs to be done about this.  Namely, rewriting dm-ramback as a
  standard block device.  There is actually no reason for ramback to
  be a device mapper device other than lack of a library for creating
  standard block devices, and that can be fixed.
