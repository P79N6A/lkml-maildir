I actually find it very useful, but I cannot argue against the
fact that it is an ext[23] specific feature.
I might like to implement a similar feature in a filesystem
independend way.
The documentation about quotas says it is also ext2 specific.
Is that still true? And has anybody BTW verified that the
quota system doesn't suffer from the same problems?
