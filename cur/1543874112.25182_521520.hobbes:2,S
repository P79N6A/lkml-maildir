Subject: [PATCH 2/2] fs: incorrect direct io error handling v8
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/19/36

If generic_file_direct_write() has fail (ENOSPC condition) inside
__generic_file_aio_write_nolock() it may have instantiated a few blocks outside
i_size in case of non blockdev files. At least ext2, ext3 and reiserfs interpret
i_size and biggest block difference as error. Later fsck will complain
about wrong i_size. After fsck will fix error i_size will be increased
to the biggest block. This is bad because this blocks contain gurbage
from previous write attempt. And result in silence file data corruption.
This issue affect fs regardless the values of blocksize or pagesize.
We need truncate any block beyond i_size after generic_file_direct_write()
has failed. In fact all existing fs witch use __generic_file_aio_write_nolock()
always call it under i_mutex for non blockdev files. This patch add 
correcspnding BUG_ON() in order to explicitly demand/document it.
Also fix out of date direct_io locking comments.
TEST_CASE:
####TESTCASE_BEGIN
   $touch /mnt/test/BIG_FILE
   ## at this moment /mnt/test/BIG_FILE size and blocks equal to zero
   open("/mnt/test/BIG_FILE", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_DIRECT, 0666) = 3
   write(3, "aaaaaaaaaaaa"..., 104857600) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device)
   ## size and block sould't be changed because write op failed.
   $stat /mnt/test/BIG_FILE
     File: `/mnt/test/BIG_FILE'
     Size: 0             Blocks: 110896     IO Block: 1024   regular empty file
   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<^^^^^^^file size is less than biggest block idx
