MkLinux was available for x86, but I have no idea if it is still in
development. To be clear, it doesn't allow you to simply replace a
kernel, but to add a second one, and possibly, to start transferring
over tasks to it. 
You can do much the same thing with user mode linux also. Again, not a
kernel replacement in that sense, but something similar, sort of.
