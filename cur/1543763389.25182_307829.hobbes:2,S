[PATCH] I2C: group Intel on I2C Hardware Bus support
 From an end-user perspective it is easy to miss the third Intel PIIX
entry on the menuconfig "I2C Hardware Bus support" screen.
Also the Intel 801 menu item does not mention ICH.
This trivial patch groups three Intel entries together, adds ICH to
menu item, and ICH5/ICH5R to the help section.  Includes suggestions
from Jean Delvare.
