Subject: [RFC] Change sendfile header
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I suggest that the header holding the prototype for sendfile should not be
in unistd.h because:
1 - sendfile is not in SuS, an is extremely non-standard
2 - there is a sendfile in BSD and it's totally different
3 - there is no man page for sendfile in Solaris, but there is a
    definition in one of the libraries which is not Linux compatible
4 - just putting the "not portable" warning in the man page to counteract
    the impression given by the <unistd.h> is not enough, programmers
    usually only read the man page  to get the args right.
Since Linux sendfile is totally applicable only to Linux, it would seem
that a better name for the header file, like linux/sendfile.h, would be
better. This has the advantage of not breaking executables, and requiring
use of a header file which makes it much harder to overlook the
portability issue.
