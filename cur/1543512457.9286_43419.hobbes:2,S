Please reply directly to me, as I do not subscribe to the list.
I just purchased a new 20G IDE hard drive, partitioned it etc., and it
worked for about a month.  I then decided to repartition it, which seemed
to be successful.  I ran 'mke2fs /dev/hdb1' on the first partition.
Here's the version info on my mke2fs:
mke2fs 1.15, 18-Jul-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
I then attempted to mount the newly created partition with mount,
version 2.9w and get the following error:
EXT2-fs: 03:41: couldn't mount RDWR because of unsupported optional
features.
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdb1,
       or too many mounted file systems
I can mount the drive read-only, but not read-write.  I am running kernel
version 2.0.36.  I've attempted to gather all of the information I could,
but if you need more to diagnose the problem, please contact me via e-mail
at eskaug@comp.uark.edu  (please also send suggestions there).
Thanks so much,
Eric Skaug
