Subject: [PATCH] resume: wait for device probing to finish
the resume code does not currently wait for device probing to finish.
Even without async function calls this is dicey and not correct,
but with async function calls during the boot sequence this is going
to get hit more...
This patch adds the synchronization using the newly introduced helper.
