Hello.
This patch set is to rearrange event notifier for memory hotplug,
because the old notifier has some defects. For example, there is no
information like new memory's pfn and # of pages for callback functions.
Fortunately, nothing uses this notifier so far, there is no impact by
this change. (SLUB will use this after this patch set to make
kmem_cache_node structure).
In addition, descriptions of notifer is added to memory hotplug
document.
This patch was a part of patch set to make kmem_cache_node of SLUB 
to avoid panic of memory online. But, I think this change becomes
not only for SLUB but also for others. So, I extracted this from it.
This patch set is for 2.6.23-rc8-mm2.
I tested this patch on my ia64 box.
Please apply.
Bye.
