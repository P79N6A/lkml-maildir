Subject: [patch 25/59] Fix UML on non-standard VM split hosts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/2/296

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Jeff Dike <jdike@addtoit.com>
This fixes UML on hosts with non-standard VM splits.  We had changed
the config variable that controls UML behavior on such hosts, but not
propogated the change everywhere.  In particular, the values of
STUB_CODE and STUB_DATA relied on the old variable.
I also reformatted the HOST_VMSPLIT_3G help to make it more standard.
Spotted by uml@flonatel.org.
