You are right: 
It's not the nicest thing to ask somebody to do a job which is not easy at
all, without me having made contributions in this area. 
I just saw you contributed a couple of patches, so I concluded that you know
quite a lot about NFS(D). And I really think it's important that sb.
competent takes this job.

Thank you very much for accepting to do it. However "G. Allen Morris III"
<gam3@dharma.sehda.com> accepted too, and IIRC the head penguin accepted
him to be the one to talk to about NFS(D) problems and to feed hom NFS
patches. 
But I think, Allen will be happy, if you give him some help ...
Thx!
