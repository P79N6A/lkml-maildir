Oh, current code is a complete mess - no arguments here. 8-element LRU.
Combined with the fact that directories allocation tries to get even
distribution of directory inodes by cylinder groups, you blow that LRU
completely on a regular basis if your fs is larger that 16 cg. For 1Kb
blocks fs it's 128Mb. For 4Kb - 2Gb. And pain starts at the half of that
size.
If you are OK with adding two extra arguments to ->readpage() I could
submit a patch replacing that with plain and simple page cache by tomorrow.
It should not be a problem to port, but I want to get some sleep before
testing it...
