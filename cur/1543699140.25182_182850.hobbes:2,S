FWIW, I've been using devfs from the beginning of 2.4 and with 2.5/2.6
with Debian and never had a problem (knock on wood). I really like the
way of having device nodes only for present devices.
Btw. I still haven't figured out, how to use udev properly. I just get
the nodes of devices I plugin after boot and of the modules I load after
boot. IDE et all aren't showing up. How early do I need to load udev or
has my kernel to be all modular for it to work properly?
Thanks,
Jan
