I guess it depends on the resulting code size and quality.  Some extra
conversions would be needed for that.
For the implementation it would be nice to have the old-style
implementations in one header and the new-style ones in a separate header. 
That would create a bit of an all-or-nothing situation, but that should be
OK?

eww, whitepsace innovations.
static inline unsigned long ffz(unsigned long word) 
{ 
	return __builtin_ctzl(~word); 
}
