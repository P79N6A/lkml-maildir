Subject: header files that are (sort of) referenced

  based on that last response, i'm curious about which header files
are technically "unreferenced" in the source tree.
  for example, consider the following two closely-related headers:
  linux/if_wanpipe.h
  linux/if_wanpipe_common.h
that second one is not included by any other file in the tree, so i
would normally call that "unused."  but the first one, while also not
included, *is* exported to userspace.
  i haven't given it much thought but it seems odd to me to include a
header file in the source tree that's technically not *used* by
anything in the source tree, only to export it to userspace.  why not
just keep it in userspace in the first place?
  or is that a silly question?

p.s.  i'm going to assume that if_wanpipe_common.h really *is* useless
and i'll be submitting my final dead header file patch shortly.
