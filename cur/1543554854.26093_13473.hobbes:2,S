Hi!
I've the same behavior here:
 server kernel : 2.2.17
 dhcpd         : 2.0b1pl29
 client kernel : 2.2.18-21
 client cmdline: root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=/foo/bar ip=bootp
After some quick tests seem that if you want bootp
you _need_ to compile the client's kernel with _only_ bootp,
if you have also dhcp, it doesn't work :(
Dhcp into kernel is COOL and I hope that someone is
porting on 2.4 ;), doesn't seem that hard
hope this help,
luca
