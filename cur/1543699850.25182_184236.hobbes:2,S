You've missed the point, though. Initializing a static variable to zero 
causes space to be consumed in the resulting object file (not 
instruction code to be generated). This is wasted space, because if you 
don't initialize to zero the variable will be allocated out of space 
that is _automatically_ zeroed for you. This reduces the size of the 
kernel image by not filling it with unnecessary zeroes.
