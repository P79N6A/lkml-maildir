Yes.  The first call is to state that TSC's are synced if it is an  AMD box
and if it is _not_ a vSMPowered box (for the apic id lifting case on Sun
boxes), the second call is for _any_ vSMPowered system with more than one
board -- TSC's are not guaranteed to be synched in that case.  Both these
calls are needed.
Thanks,
