I don't get the problem: if you want your web browser to be able to
access where you commonly store your documents, then give it that
permission. The above rule says that your web browser doesn't get to go
change AppArmor policy on its own.
I have serious doubts about the utility of restricting a text editor.
You nominally want to be able to edit any file on the system, so
confining it would be fairly meaningless.

AppArmor will let you do that; most of the work is in splitting the
application. If you can get e.g. Firefox to use a separate process that
it exec's for editing your preferences, then AppArmor can confine that
helper app with a different policy than Firefox itself, including
granting the helper write permission to the config directory.
