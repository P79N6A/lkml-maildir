Sometimes if fails to load the modules for the usb devices at boot but 
there are no step to reproduce, looks totally random and only on rare 
occasions if failing.

I know that most major distros made the switch, but does anything 
changed so it would make debian's hotplug scripts (and i don't thing 
they are only used on debian) incompatible with kernels greater than 
2.6.15 ? I cannot risk to upgrade to udev and have the same unstable 
platform. The most secure option that i have now is going back to 2.6.13 
if udev can't give me a satisfactory answer.
PS: I can't find any mailing list named linux-hotplug-devel as i would 
be more that happy to move my mail there.
