Is there any way to safely probe a PCI motherboard to determine whether
or not it has ISA cards present, or ISA card slots?
Note: the question is *not* about a probe for whether the board has an ISA
bridge, but a probe for the presence of actual ISA cards (or slots).
(Yes, I'm working on a smart autoconfigurator.  It's a development of
Giacomo Catenazzi's code, but able to use the CML2 deduction engine.)
