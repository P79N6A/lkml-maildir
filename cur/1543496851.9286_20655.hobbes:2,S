I noticed this in the late 2.1 kernels. 2.1.125-2.1.129
They just froze for no reason at all. It didn't freeze completely the
thing that happend was that the system was using about 99.9% cpu
This was in console, I could write things but the keyboard didn't respond
too fast. When I tried to run ls I had to wait about 5min before it ran.
to run top I had to wait even longer.
Two of my friends experienced this with kernel 2.2.5 with just 10 min
apart. Thay where in X. The only thing you can do when this happens is to
switch the power off och press the reset-button.
I did try to wait it out, but after waiting about 2-3 hours I switched the
power off and booted it up again. But I havn't personally experienced this
in kernel 2.2.x or 2.3.0 ( maybe I should upgrade to 2.3.3? )
