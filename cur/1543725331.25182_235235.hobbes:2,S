I have a question about equalize_2.4.18.patch.
I use a kernel 2.4.25.
And I have multi-processor(Xeon dual) machine.
I had patch equalize_2.4.18.patch file.
And I had check ‘Symmetric multi-processing support’ kernel compile
option. When I use that kernel, the system is down. But, I had not check
‘Symmetric multi-processing support’ kernel compile option, and, I had
complie that kernel. 
When I uset that kernel, the system is good.
How to solve that problem?
