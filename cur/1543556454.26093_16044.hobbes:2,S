Well, yes, I thought they could not have known:-)) I'm absolutely stuck. If disk is fine, chipset is fine and supported by the kernel, then BIOS doesn't (or shouldn't) make a difference... Then WHAT ON THE EARTH??? Mike, have you been able to recall what BIOS option turned DMA on? Shall I write to Andre Hedrick directly? Or is there a mailing-list smth. like linux-ide?
