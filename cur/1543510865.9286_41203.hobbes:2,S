You don't listen, do you? No matter how much I say "application-level
checking is good but you still need other measures", all you hear is
"application-level checking is bad". Look, I give up. Believe whatever 
you want, okay? Don't let what I actually said get in the way or
anything.

Yeah, it's possible. But now we've moved from "totally screwed" to
"way inconvenienced because I have to play hunt-for-the-tape for a
long time". No, it's not optimal. I'm not claiming it is. I'm simply
claiming that it's possible to avoid being screwed without having your 
version control system do lots of fancy error checking.
If I've failed to get your point, then maybe you've also failed to get 
mine.

Question: Does BitKeeper prevent me from having garbage in my
repository? Completely? Or does it just make it less likely? I believe 
it just makes it less likely, which is why I claim that backups and
disk arrays are still more important.

You miss the point. Totally.
You claimed that Aegis was worse than BK because of support. You
claimed that since Peter didn't have commercial support in place,
users might have to maintain the code themselves if they wanted
support, and that your solution was better.
I pointed out that, in fact, your solution could be a lot worse, since 
instead of losing support people can also have ended up throwing away
a lot of money for support that is no longer there.
In response, you whined and got insulting. Hardly a stellar example of 
why I or anyone else should trust you for good support.

I'm glad you want me to be happy. I'd like you to be happy too.
If you'd really like me to be happy, maybe you should try keeping the
women and free product and cash and just start listening to people
without all your damn arrogance for once. I'm sick of it.
It's become clear to me over the past few messages that you really
don't care about what anyone who disagrees with you has to
say. They're all either fools or amateurs or deluded or in some way or 
another idiots who should not be listened to. Only you have the
answer, and it is BitKeeper. You made it so the Linux kernel could use 
it and love it, and by God we'd better all be grateful. You deserve
more than the insolence of dissenting opinions, you deserve
applause. So:
<clap> ... <clap> ... <clap>. huzzah!
Look, Larry, let's make a deal. I'll stop trying to discuss this issue 
and you'll stop belittling me and telling me why anything I think is
inferior to what you think. I'll stop questioning your product, and
you'll stop hyping it, because by now I'm pretty sure I don't want
it. If you can be this arrogant and insulting to me for simply
disagreeing with you on a mailing list, I don't ever want to see what
happens if I've used your product and end up having a real problem
with it. I've tried to restrain myself, be reasonable, and keep the
discussion focussed on the issues at hand. Maybe I failed and went too 
far to the side of insult, but I'd like to believe that at least I
tried to be nice about it. I don't believe you've made any such
effort, and I don't think you have any intention of doing so. As such, 
I don't think I have anything more to say to you about this.
