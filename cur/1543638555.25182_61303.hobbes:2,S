These numbers show a 30% reduction in rmap overhead with my patch,
close to what I originally reported:
  ((35.904 + 35.690 + 35.921) - (27.814 + 27.763 + 27.861)) / 
  ((39.316 + 39.405 + 39.062) - (27.814 + 27.763 + 27.861)) ~= .70
But they also show that rmap overhead is around 29% on your box,
even with my patch:
  (35.904 + 35.690 + 35.921) / (27.814 + 27.763 + 27.861) ~= 1.29
Granted, it's still way too high, and we are still in search of the
'dark cycles'.
Did we do an apples-to-apples comparison of 2.4 to 2.5?  Because if
we did, then going by your numbers, 2.5.26 is already considerably
worse than 2.4.19-pre7:
  ((30.260 + 29.642)/2) / ((27.814 + 27.763 + 27.861)/3) ~= 1.08
Is it fair to compare your 2.4 vs 2.5 numbers?
