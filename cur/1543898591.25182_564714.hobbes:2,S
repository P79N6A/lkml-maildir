Well, the sys_sync() that caused your original problem did exactly 
that.  It's the reason you get deadlocks, right?
I agree that in general the suspend process should not have to wait for 
a userspace callback to complete.  Indeed, there's no particular 
reason that anything running during STR should have to wait for 
something in userspace to complete.  Given that fact, I don't see 
anything wrong with freezing userspace when doing STR.
