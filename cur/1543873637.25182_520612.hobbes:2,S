To create a DOS attack.
- Allocate some memory you know your victim will want in the future,
  (shared libraries and the like).
- Wait until your victim is using the memory you allocated.
- Terminate your memory resource group.
- Victim is pushed over memory limits by your exiting.
- Victim can no longer allocate memory
- Victim dies
It's not quite that easy unless your victim calls mlockall(MCL_FUTURE),
but the potential is clearly there.
Am I missing something?  Or is this fundamental to any first touch scenario?
I just know I have problems with first touch because it is darn hard to
reason about.
