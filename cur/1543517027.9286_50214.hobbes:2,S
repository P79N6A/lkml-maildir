page cache or page tables?
if you want to rely on the page table, then pmd_alloc() and pte_alloc()
could become a problem.

Or: we define a new value SWP_LOADING (eg SWP_ENTRY(1,0).
if the pte entry is SWP_LOADING, then we just sleep.
otherwise, we replace the pte with SWP_LOADING, do the actual io, and
wake-up all other threads that are waiting.
