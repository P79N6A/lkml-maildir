Yes you can.  Look at drivers/sound/ad1816.c or drivers/sound/sb_card.c for
examples.

The Linux 2.4 isapnp code does _not_ use isapnp.conf.
Did you write your driver using the isapnp_ kernel APIs (Documented in
Documentation/isapnp.txt)?  Or is it a plain isa driver that needs help
from the isapnp tools to work?

This was true for Linux 2.2 and earlier as those did not actually support
isapnp and needed the help of the uselevel isapnp tools.  Because they can
only be used after the system is up isapnp drivers for theses kernel have to
be modules.

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
