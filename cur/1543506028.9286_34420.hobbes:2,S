Hi,
  one waiting patch for inclusion sooner or later is:
ftp://rudy.mif.pg.gda.pl/pub/People/ankry/linux-patches/2.3/patch-xconfig-990709.gz
  it fixes the problem of the unset max physical memory choice which appeared in
2.2.11. Maybe it can get a little testing in some of the pre kernels for 2.3 and
2.2. It appied cleanly to 2.2.11 and 2.3.13 here. The mail below was one of the
many reports of this problem.

Use make oldconfig before using make xconfig. The latter is broken.

Subject: Re: Menuconfig missing functions
Hi, 
   there's a patch that includes more fixes for Configure/Menuconfig/xconfig
at 
   
ftp://rudy.mif.pg.gda.pl/pub/People/ankry/linux-patches/2.3/
current version is patch-xconfig-990709.
I don't include it as it is not very small (92.5 kB) ...
