I don't really like filesystem magic options as kernel boot time options.
Mount time or runtime options are probably more interesting.
How is it expected that users will use this?
A lot of the privacy you are talking about is provided by the may_ptrace
checks in the more sensitive parts of proc so we may want to extend
that.
