Hi BMECMAIL,
1. are you actually using initrd or are you just cut-and-pasting entries
in /etc/lilo.conf without having any clue what you are doing (since you
provided PCI config info as relevant to this problem, the latter is quite
likely)
2. did you compile ELF support statically into the kernel?
3. did you compile ext2 support statically into the kernel?
4. did you forget to upgrade modutils as documented in
Documentation/Changes?
Regards,
Tigran
