I cannot answer your question about the level of support this chipset
has, but suffice it to say that my new (as of last week) A7A266 based
system (1.2Ghz T-Bird w/256MB Crucial DDR RAM) is running 2.4.5 (and
previous to that 2.2.18) quite nicely.  Perhaps Linux is not optimized
for performance with this chipset, but it feels fast to me.
According to 'hdparm -t /dev/hda', I am getting 25MB/s transfer rates
with my Quantum Fireball Plus LM.  Seems a little high, but drive
performance 'feels' good.
Based on my weekend experience with this board and Linux, I think I have
made the right choice.
