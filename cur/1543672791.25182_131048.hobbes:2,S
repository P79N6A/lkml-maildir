Subject: Re: [RFC][PATCH] "Disable Trackpad while typing" on Notebooks withh  aPS/2 Trackpad
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch makes it impossible to perform any operation that requires
pressing a key on the keyboard while clicking a mouse button - for
example bringing up X-terminal menu with CTRL-<middle button>. I am sure
there are other similar combination used by other software. You would
think 1 second after the CTRL key is pressed (which is when a keyboard
event is generated), mouse will be re-enabled and you should be able to
click mouse buttons as long as you do not let go of the key. Does not
seem to work that way. Mouse stays disabled as long as the key is
pressed.
