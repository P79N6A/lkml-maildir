arch/i386/kernel/traps.c, in function do_simd_coprocessor_error, refers
to such an undocumented thing. I haven't been successful in finding any
references elsewhere to such behavior, and hence I found the only choice
would be to ask here whether anyone can provide some background and/or
pointers to what functionality is being dealt with here.
Thanks a lot, Jan
