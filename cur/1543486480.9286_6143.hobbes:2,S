Just to add my 2c, I noticed the same thing with a little module
that repeatedly adds itself to tq_immediate and exports a count to 
/proc. It executes either two or four times the interrupt frequency 
depending on whether an application selects on rtc or does a blocking 
read. Isn't that simply due to scheduling on the interrupt and syscall
returns?
But I noticed something else curious. When I had apm compiled in
along with CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE, the task would execute between
30000 to 40000 times per second!  Removing apm it went back
the more "normal" 400 to 600.  
Just wondering is this the expected behavior?
