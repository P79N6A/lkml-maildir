Beowulf Process Space (
http://bproc.sourceforge.net/
).
A kernel set of patches and modules to make a cluster look like
a single box wrt process management (SSI, single system image),
and allow efficient process migration between boxes. This is
just the part that patches the kernel.
Note this location is not an official one for BProc, but just my
hack to have the patch applying on recent development kernels,
and can be broken in some hidden way.
