Negatory on that, Willy!
Here is what I have verified:
  At kernel.org:/pub/linux/v2.4
file: patch-2.4.34.3.bz2 has the corruption at line 213:
  goto errout
That is where that came from, when I patched my 2.4.34 to arrive
at 2.4.34.5, before applying the 2.4.35.rc5 patch!
Hope that helps, maybe you can fix, because I cant post to
kernel.org v2.4 tree, that I know of.
