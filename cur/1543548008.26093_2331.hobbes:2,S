If it is the 2.2.16 scheduler & other linux'es have a bug.
The following code snippets can go into a tight loop.
while (p != &init_task)
{
     if (can_schedule(p))
     {
          int weight = goodness(prev, p, this_cpu);
          if (weight > c)
               c = weight, next = p;
     }
     p = p->next_run;
}
/* Do we need to re-calculate counters? */
if (!c)
     goto recalculate;
recalculate:
{
     struct task_struct *p;
     spin_unlock_irq(&runqueue_lock);
     read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
     for_each_task(p)
          p->counter = (p->counter >> 1) + p->priority;
     read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
     spin_lock_irq(&runqueue_lock);
     goto repeat_schedule;
}
If the weight & priority of all runnable processes  is 0 then the
recalculate with recalculate p->counter=0 for all runnable processes,
& the code will go into a tight loop between the goodness calculation &
recalculate.
Not very robust in my opinion.
