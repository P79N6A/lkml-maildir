No, the problem is that there is not code to allow for setfeature options
called via hdparm to tiddle with pci-chipset transfer speeds.
I gather that Intel based boards have more flexiblity on allowing XFER
rates to be changed without harming the system.

Modern IDE-pci chipsets now have definable values in the pci-config space
to max transfer rates.  If the transfer rates are tinkered with the
corallary applies to the chipset.

Very unlikely, only Single Word DMA transfers have been retired.

Bang!!!!!!! You nailed that one perfectly in both cases (as of today).
Look at how nasty and harsh the chipset code for tuning the Promise
Ultra33/66 cards are in "./drivers/block/pdc202xx.c".  This will give you
the idea of how hard it is to get this task done correctly at init time.
As for down/upgrading xfer rates after boot is not even considered to
date.
I just now took the risk of putting theory in to practice with the
Ultra33, understand that only the first card has a physical BIOS chip
installed.  The second two are fakes that the cards are reporting;
however, the second card does share the BIOS data from the first card.
This data is generally wrong.............whereas the third card is solely
configured by the linux driver.

If we are limiting the discussion to Intel chipsets, Artop AEC6210UF
or an other that allow for AUTO speed, you may have options.
If you call "-X stuff" on a code tuned Promise card that the BIOS failed
and Linux had to force imposed configurations, expect a KABOOM!!!!!!!
The most that I will give a pass on is the "-d stuff".
You can turn DMA(general) on/off, but setfeatures are off limits.
The current piix.c code does basic PIO tuning, but DMA configs are still a
WIP.  I have the means to test this and make it work with PIIX3/4 but
PIIXa/b are S.O.L. for now............
I am finding myself agreeing more and more with M.L. and G.O. about the
concept of active tuning of IDE-PCI junk.........It is getting harder and
harder to derive code that is my goal for a true "uniform-ide-X.yy"
driver.  Understand that SuperSocket 7 is the absolute pain of the
concept.  In many cases, venders of SS7 with crummy BIOS code writers
bring fear that forcing a setup override via imperical data could cause
future problems.
In the past, the IDE-driver relied on BIOS setup that worked well.
Now there are so many reported cases of BIOS setup failures that is is
scary.  I would contribute this problem to the "miniport" interface that
MS uses to setup devices via a plug-in or something......again we suffer
at the fingers of Gates..............
