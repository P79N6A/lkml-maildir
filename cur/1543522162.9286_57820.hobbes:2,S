People not using BSD/Unixware/Solaris partitions do not have anu problem at
all. But if you use any of {BSD,Unixware,Solaris} together with DOS-extended
it does not solve your problem: add/remove any logical drive in the extended
partition and all your {BSD,Unixware,Solaris} slices become renumbered...

Same with DOS-extended/logical drives...
But the problem is the devices/symlinks need to be created during kernel
start by devfs or another animal - it does no matter.

This is better solution, but unfortunately not all filesystems have/support
label/uuid ...
