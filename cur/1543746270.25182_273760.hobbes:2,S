Not really.  The permissions for the sysfs files, if nothing else, have to be done 
manually.  Plus, check out:
http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/kernel-janitors/2004-November/002559.html
and
http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/kernel-janitors/2004-November/002592.html
for two examples of the kinds of problems that a script would run into.  Not 
rocket science, but it can be tricky.
