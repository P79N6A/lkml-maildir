The kernel is greppable in either case.  It's foolish to rigidly insist 
that long strings must not be broken.  And don't forget that some 
strings are created dynamically (with %s specifiers, for instance).  
How are you going to grep for them?
It's also worth pointing out that much of the source code in usbcore 
tends to indent continuation lines by two extra tab stops.  This isn't 
done all the time, admittedly.  But deliberately changing the code so 
that continuations use only one tab stop feels like a bad idea -- one 
extra tab stop looks too much like a nested statement.
