    this is already in kernel and called Quality of Service (QoS) or 
traffic shaping.
    command is called /sbin/tc. (located in iproute.rpm in RH)
    instead of man page (because there is no man page) I can recommend 
to look in Internet.
    e.g. 
http://users.belgacom.net/staf/
 -> QoS intro
    also you can try to "rpm -ql $(which tc)" - probably your distor has 
some docs.
