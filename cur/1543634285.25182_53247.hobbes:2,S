Technically, shouldn't we make these `unsigned long' ?
I know on x86 we store cpu as a `u32' so it does not matter per se, but
in reality it is an unsigned long and other architectures may export it
as such.
Further, we compare and set it against the various CPU bitmaps and they
are all `unsigned long' and we do shifts against 1UL ...
