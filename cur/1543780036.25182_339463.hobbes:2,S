Hey! You removed my admission to this. Don't make me look stupid

Darn it, since this should really be reported.  Yes, the core netpoll
should bail out, but it is also a problem with the driver and should be
fixed.
Come to think of it, I should have submitted a patch that did what you
did when I discovered the problem with the e100. But that network card
was slow and could easily lock up when doing a sysrq-t.  I wasn't
removing cables, so I just submitted the fix for the e100, not thinking
that the netpoll shouldn't lock up itself.
