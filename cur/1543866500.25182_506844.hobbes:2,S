Hi.
What's drivers/char/scan_keyb.{c,h} for, when it's referenced in no place (aside 
a fact, that it uses some old API and hence is broken)?
$ grep -r scan_keyb *
drivers/char/scan_keyb.c: *     $Id: scan_keyb.c,v 1.2 2000/07/04 06:24:42

drivers/char/scan_keyb.c:struct scan_keyboard {
drivers/char/scan_keyb.c:       struct scan_keyboard *next;
drivers/char/scan_keyb.c:static struct scan_keyboard *keyboards=NULL;
drivers/char/scan_keyb.c:       struct scan_keyboard *kbd;
drivers/char/scan_keyb.c:int register_scan_keyboard(int (*scan)(unsigned char 
*buffer),
drivers/char/scan_keyb.c:       struct scan_keyboard *kbd;
drivers/char/scan_keyb.c:       kbd = kmalloc(sizeof(struct scan_keyboard), 
GFP_KERNEL);
