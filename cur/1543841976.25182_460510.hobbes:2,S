Ok. I've had a go at that:

Yes, I'd realised that, its a question of which one to put in. Even
though I've been working on this for almost a year now, its still true
to say that Ken Preslan's code is more numerous than mine. So I'm not
sure that I should claim authorship for myself, on the other hand, if
this is a statement of where bug fixes should be sent, then I'm probably
as good a choice as any. There are of course a lot of other contributors
both from within Red Hat, and particularly since the review process
started, from outside Red Hat too.

Ok, now fixed in:

Yes, and my (rather small) treeware dictionary says likewise - its fixed
now anyway.

Hmm. I'm not sure that this would really be the right thing... what I
want is to limit the maximum number of times that this is triggered
rather than limiting the rate at which its triggered. I think thats a
subtle difference from the ratelimit functions,
Steve.
