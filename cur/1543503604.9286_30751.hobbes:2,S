Hi

AmigaOS called

I noticed the similarity too, however, I think it is probably a risky
thing to attempt, it opens up all sorts of security and stability
issues (the latter you summarised).
It there is a bug fix for Linux, it is much easier to patch the kernel
tree. SetFunction() was used on the Amiga for fixing bugs in the
closed source OS and for straping on new functionality. Neither of
those are really necessary for Linux since the bug or new feature can
be massaged directly onto the kernel source.
