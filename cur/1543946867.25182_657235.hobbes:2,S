yes there's multiple interfaces. There are multiple interfaces *today*.
Oprofile/perfmon2 are very focused on CPU events and have complex interfaces,
sysprof has a much more simple interface (and yes, very specific to syspref)
that just focuses on samples.
Sadly, I think there's use for both, and forcing both into the same straightjacket is a mistake imo.
