Hi all,
I have just put a snapshot, or if you will, a pre-release on:
	<
http://www.pi.se/blox/modutils/modutils-2.2.2-pre1.tar.gz>
I would appreciate if you could:
- Test it, especially with egcs and libc2.1.
- Look at how far from reality my wordexp() use in util/config.c is.
- Look at the man pages, especially conf.modules.5, both to
  learn the new features as well as to find things I've forgotten.
Please note that the "path" directives in /etc/conf.modules should be
according to the "modules-2.0.0" syntax, that is:
    path[A_TAG]=A_PATH  means that modules with tag A_TAG are in A_PATH
In modutils-2.1.121 (and earlier in the 2.1 series) the syntax was modified:
    path[A_TAG]=A_PATH  meant that modules with tag A_TAG were in A_PATH/A_TAG
Although I have made some attempts to handle both syntaxes, I cannot
promise that the "modutils-2.1.121" is fully and correctly supported.
Comments, fixes, additional features to:
