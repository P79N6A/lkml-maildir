You've completely missed the point -- it is _plausible_ that callers
(even if just _one_) have const timespec/timeval structs, which is why
that commit made sense as I mentioned above (to shut up the warning that
would otherwise occur). This does not hold true for the sched.h / struct
task_struct case here -- I cannot imagine a const task_struct.

Going about const-ifying such function arguments as in here (for the sake
of type safety, where the function does not modify that argument), could
easily lead to *zillions* of patches such as this which would have
absolutely _zero_ impact on the actual kernel that gets built.
As I said, if someone really wants to do this, please go about constifying
_data_ instead -- that would make a (positive) difference.
