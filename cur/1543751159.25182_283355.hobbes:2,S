Just to avoid confusion: If your bios does *not contain the fix, the
kernel should fix it and above line should appear. (It does here with
2.6.10) So if it doesn't in your case (and your bios does not contain
that fix), the detection code probably isn't enough. -> This should be
fixed in kernel.
When you use a fixed bios though, above line should not appear, and your
system should be stable.
