Putting the From: in the Signed-off-by block is a result of two thoughts:
   1. putting it at the top makes the most sense from an email
      perspective, but it often seem to get lost by various
      patch-posting programs if it gets tangled in the Subject/summary
      part of the patch.  The result is that it needs to float in an odd
      way:
          Subject: wooble the foo
          From: Foo Woobler <foo@wooble.com>
          Wooble foos in the appropriate manner.
          Signed-off-by: Foo Woobler <foo@wooble.com>
          Cc: Bar Mangler <bar@mangle.org> 
          
   2. There's already a block of email addresses which describe how
      people relate to this patch, so why not put From: there (since it
      isn't really an email From header, but a patch metadata header). 
      I'd assumed that tools which pick "Thing: Email" pairs out of a
      patch would deal with From in the same place as a Signed-off-by. 
      After all, tools deal with Cc:s there.
I'll make sure From: is in the right place in future, but I just wanted 
to point out it wasn't complete randomness.
