This looks wrong.  The __meminit and __cpuinit definitions we have now are
OK, aren't they?  Surely the problem is that some functions/variables are
incorrectly tagged?
If some function is needed by both HOTPLUG_CPU and HOTPLUG_MEMORY then
we're rather messed up - I guess it'll need to be put inside #if
defined(..) || defined(..) and put into plain old .text.
