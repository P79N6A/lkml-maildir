Hi all,
I have 1G physical memory on the system.  out of which only 200 MB is known
to the linux kernel.  Now I have some buffers in the other 824 MB of memory. 
These buffers would be inherently non cacheable because that memory is
unknow to the system.  I was wondering how can I include some of the buffers
in that memory in the page table so that they become cacheable.
Any inputs would be highly appreciated.
Thanks
Aby
