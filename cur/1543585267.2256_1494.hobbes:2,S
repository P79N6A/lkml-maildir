With a preemptible kernel, we need to enter the page fault handler with
interrupts disabled to protect the cr2 register.  The interrupt state is
restored immediately after cr2 has been saved.  Otherwise, an interrupt
could cause the faulting thread to be preempted, and the new thread
could also fault, clobbering the cr2 register for the preempted thread.
See the diff for linux/arch/i386/mm/fault.c.
