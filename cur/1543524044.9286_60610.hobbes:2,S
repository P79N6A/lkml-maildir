This sounds like the problem I had before with gpm and the switching from
a ps/2 mouse to a usb mouse.  Here's the situation:
- /dev/mouse is a symlink to /dev/psaux
- gpm is setup to use /dev/mouse
- ps/2 mouse is removed and a usb mouse is connected instead
- kernel has support for both ps/2 and usb mouse built in
When you reboot, everything boots up normally, but the loading of gpm causes
the keyboard to be frozen and you can't type anything at the login prompt.
If you remember to change the /dev/mouse symlink or just delete /dev/mouse
before you reboot, everything is fine.  It seems to only be a problem if
/dev/mouse points to /dev/psaux and there is no ps/2 mouse connected.  The
way I got around it was to boot in single user mode and redo the /dev/mouse
so it points to the correct device.
