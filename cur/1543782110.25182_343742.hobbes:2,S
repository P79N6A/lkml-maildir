yes there are still some unknown issues in the r200 drivers even on my
own 9200, this isn't probably more of an issue with the userspace
driver (granted I think the DRM could have some race condition as
well...)

Linus,
Can we revert the PCI assign resources patch? this is 2-3 bug reports
with it and they all centre on the MGA G550 card, we need to be able
to do some sort of blacklisting perhaps so these cards don't get
touched until we can figure out why it is breaking X...
Dave.
