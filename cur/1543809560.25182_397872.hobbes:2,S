It fixes that exact oops but only by preventing us getting that far
due to another oops.
We call cpu_up, which sends a CPU_UP_PREPARE event.  This causes the
migration thread to be spawned, and rq->migration_thread to be set.
Eventually, we call the architecture __cpu_up(), which ends up
calling init_idle().  Due to this patch, init_idle() then NULLs out
rq->migration_thread.
Later, we send a CPU_ONLINE event, which then tries to do
wake_up_process(rq->migration_thread) - resulting in a NULL pointer
deref in try_to_wake_up().
Hence, with this patch, it looks like rq will be used prior to
initialisation.  I could try commenting out the migration_thread
initialisation to NULL, but I suspect that there may be other
problems associated with this patch (eg, rq->migration_queue).
