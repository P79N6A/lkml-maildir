This logic is flawed, IMO. There is clearly a difference between trying to
send an IPI interrupt to oneself (which is what smp_call_function_single
on the current CPU could be thought to mean), and trying to send an IPI
interrupt to a processor that doesn't even exist (i.e. the case for both
smp_call_function() and smp_call_function_single() on !SMP). There are
other issues too ...

Right, preemption must clearly be disabled. I have no experience with
non-x86 arch's, but i386 and x86_64 escape these issues due to the
call_lock spinlock or get_cpu()/put_cpu() pair, as discussed on the
other thread.

There is a lot of inter-arch inconsistency, yes, but as far as the
semantics of smp_call_function() and smp_call_function_single() is
concerned, my understanding is simply what is documented in the
comments: we use smp_call_function when we wish to run given function
on _all_ *other* CPUs, and use smp_call_function_single when we wish
to run given function on _specified_ *other* CPU.

This changes smp_call_function() semantics, does it not? Also, (stating
the obvious), we could simply /call/ the given function to run it on
current CPU. All the IPI infrastructure exists precisely for the case
when we want to run something on some _other_ CPU, doing otherwise
could horribly break things ...
A hypothetical example is when we wish to make another CPU halt (say
the passed function contains a "for (;;) ;") and then we wish to proceed
with some further work in-current-thread / on-current-CPU itself. If
we've jumped to target CPU by the time of execution of the call, and
then proceed to just execute the darn function as proposed ... and all
hell breaks loose.
I would strongly recommend not changing current semantics of both the
smp_call_function{_single} functions. [ Please do let me know if / where
I'm wrong, otherwise. ]

Same reasoning as above?

I'm fine with this proposed name change.

Needs to be fixed, clearly. I'll submit a patch for the same, shortly.

Which might be a reasonable thing to do if we've realized the target CPU
has somehow become the current CPU itself (after flagging a BUG / WARN
I would add). But like said earlier, this is not quite comparable to the
!SMP situation where the target CPU doesn't exist at all. I still feel both
of these should go BUG / WARNING on !SMP. The caller seems to have
gone wrong in logic somewhere, so we might as well flag it? [ For a
slightly more comparable case, we can refer to what powerpc does on
!cpu_online(target_cpu) and return -EINVAL; as suggested in my patch? ]
[ Clarifying / adding to smp_call_function{_single} semantics so that
various arch's can follow these without inconsistencies / mess. ]

Agreed.

Agreed. We might also add what David Miller suggested earlier:
smp_call_function{_single} are illegal from _any_ asynchronous context,
such as hardirq, softirq, etc. [ s390 might need to be allowed to go
lax here, it contains a driver that needs to call these from softirq,
I think. ]

on_each_cpu() is a different case, IMHO. The single processor in UP does
belong to the "each" CPUs of a system. Same can't be said about the
smp_call_function* for UP ...
