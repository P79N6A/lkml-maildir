Ahh, I forgot to mention that none of my drives were supplying term power.
I believe I'm using a high quality cable: the wires between the connectors
are braided; it only about two feet long.
I have an LVD/SE terminator on the last connector.
As for parity, the drive doesn't have a parity jumper on it. I'll assume that
parity is enabled.
BTW, it is really difficult to find the small jumpers these newer drives need.
Especially since a lot of online resellers sell the drive only, with no accessories.
Thanks for your input.
