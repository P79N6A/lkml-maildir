That might be a problem if the whole subsystem disappears, but if only ISA
support from some driver is pruned away, they are still able to use the old
driver by replacing the new one from some older kernel.
Then, we'll get nicer drivers in return.

I don't know if you understand me correctly (I might write it slightly unclear)
and if I understand you correctly now. I didn't mean to wipe out the (E)ISA
support from the kernel, I meant eliminating it from drivers which will be
rewritten to pci probing.
