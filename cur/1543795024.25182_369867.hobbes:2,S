the first portion of the transport switch is in 2.6.15-rcX.  at this
point i'm expecting the EXPORT_SYMBOL changes to go in 2.6.17 or later.
so i don't remember why you are removing xdr_decode_string.  are we sure
that no-one will need this functionality in the future?  it is harmless
to remove today, but i wonder if someone is just going to add it back
sometime.
