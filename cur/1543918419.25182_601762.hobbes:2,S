We skip locked pages in writeback, and if some filesystems have
blocking issues that require non-blocking writeback waits for some
I/O to complete before re-entering writeback, then perhaps they should be
setting wbc->encountered_congestion to tell writeback to back off.
The question I'm asking is that if more_io tells us we have more
work to do, why do we have to sleep first if the block dev is
able to take more I/O?

Sure, but wbc.more_io doesn't indicate a blockade - just that there
is more work to do, right?

What happens if there I/O we issued has already completed before we
got back up to the congestion_wait() call? We'll spend 100ms
sleeping when we shouldn't have and throughput goes down by 10% on
every occurrence....
if we've got more work to do, then we should do it without an
arbitrary, non-deterministic delay being inserted. If the delay is
needed to prevent he system from "going mad" (whatever tht means),
then what's the explaination for the system "going mad"?

So, with Jens Axboe's sglist chaining, that single I/O could now
be up to 32MB on some hardware. IOWs, we push 1024 pages, and that
could end up as a single I/O being issued to disk.
Your magic just broke. :/

I think this is the wrong thing to be doing and is detrimental
to I/o perfomrance because it wil reduce elevator efficiency.
The elevator can only work efficiently if we allow the queues to
build up. The deeper the queue, the better the elevator can sort the
I/o requests and keep the device at maximum efficiency.  If we don't
push enough I/O into the queues the we miss opportunities to combine
adjacent I/Os and reduce the seek load of writeback. Also, a shallow
queue will run dry if we don't get back to it in time which is
possible if we wait for I/o to complete before we go and flush
more....
Cheers,
Dave.
