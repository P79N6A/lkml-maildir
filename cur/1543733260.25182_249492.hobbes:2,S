yes, that is done in hw_random and 8xx_tco for a long time...

Also check that you pass the righ io port to the modules (the irq won't
be use, it will use only polling mode )...
If you had enable pnpbios in your kernel, you could see your midi port
with :
for i in /sys/bus/pnp/devices/* ; do if [ "$(<$i/id)" = "PNP0b006" ];
then cat $i/resources;cat $i/options; fi ; done
