netconsole should be more quick:
* one more box with ethernet card
* CONFIG_NETCONSOLE=y
* CONFIG_ {your NIC driver} =y
* on crashing box add the following line to the kernel boot options
	netconsole=@src-ip/eth0,9353@dst-ip/dst-MAC
where	scr-ip -- IP of crashing box
	eth0 -- interface on crashing box
	9353 -- destination port (for netcat to listen on target box)
	dst-ip -- IP of a box which collect logs
	dst-MAC -- MAC of the interface on destination box
* on destination box run netcat
	nc -u -l -p 9353 &>1.log
[* add ignore_loglevel on crashing box if paranoid]
Now reboot crashing box and reproduce the bug, chances are high that it
will send oops over network.
