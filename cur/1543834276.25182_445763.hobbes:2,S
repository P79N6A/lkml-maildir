I would say we don't even _want_ this.
A u1 variable will basically never be one bit wide.
It will be at least 8bit, or let's say 32bit. Maybe
even 64bit on some archs. It all depends on the compiler
plus the arch.
We _don't_ want u1, because we don't get what we see.
If we say u8 or u32, we get an 8bit wide data type and
a 32bit wide type. But we _don't_ get a 1bit wide
type for u1. We get something undefined.
Consider:
struct device_control_buffer {
	u1 device_is_fooing;
	u32 foodata;
} __attribute__((packed));
This would not lead to the expected results.
It's horribly broken, obfuscating and misleading.
