First - a warning.  Newbie on the loose, running around, asking for a whack with 
the cluebat.
I had seen other drivers that had cli()/sti() calls in the ioctl functions.  So, 
that is wrong?  Should all of those cli()/sti() calls be removed?
Just to site things properly in my mind, was it always the case that ioctl is 
called under lock_kernel, or is this a relatively recent (2.3+) development?  Some 
of the *really* abandoned drivers haven't been touched in at least that long.

Erm.  Didn't notice that.
