Yes; that's stale text, referring to some earlier code that had been changed.

Terrific! I will make the change locally.
Btw, it's ``hand coded''.  ``Open coding'' is what both programmers and macros
do. Hand conding is the dumb thing I did instead of using the macro to open
code it. :)

Only glibc knows about sys_exit. (Or are there run-times for other language
implementations that have their own binding to sys_exit, bypassing pthreads?)
The POSIX interface used by applications is pthread_exit, and there is no
assumption there about it being an exit-like system call. It has a number of
standard-defined user-space chores to do, in fact.

pthread_exit peforms cleanup unwinding (required by Unix and POSIX) and
destruction of thread-specific storage.
Glibc does this and then performs its own longjmp to a handler in the startup
code above main. At that point it's no longer correct to longjmp to any of
the frames that have been aborted by that action.  It's still executing user
code; sys_exit has not been called yet, and the signal handler can go
off.
Other than that, there is actually nothing wrong with aborting sys_exit. It
hasn't done any cleanup yet through do_exit, so it can be nicely
reentered later.
I'd say that any programs that are broken by this patch are
probably ``fork in the toaster'' category anyway.
Note that programs can also abort the exit function with signals, too,
and there is nothing that can be done in the kernel about it.

But if this problem is patched in this very simple way in the kernel, then gdb
installations ``Just Work'' without even being recompiled.
Probably, the only way the gdb maintainers would accept another Linux-specific
hack would be if they didn't know that a kernel patch will fix it. :)
