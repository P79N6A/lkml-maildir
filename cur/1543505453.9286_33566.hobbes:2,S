How about immutable symlinks (I think that's the right word) that are
visible from linux for the short names?  They could be manipulated by
anything in the "know" via ioctls or something, but not by usual tools
(rm, mv, etc.)
This won't fix the back up problem.  And it won't be fun for copying
to/from vfat space.
The only other solution is that the VFS runs with long names and a
userspace tool runs afterwards/periodically to re-sync the short names.
I suspect that the backup/copy problem is not fixable.  If you want
correct backups of the short names, then the proper tools will be needed.
*sigh*
Ciao!
