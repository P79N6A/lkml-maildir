Hello!
I've installed 2.4.0 on a system that has been tracking 2.3.xx/2.4test for
quite a while.  With 2.4.0 installed, I've started to see the following
errors:
reset_xmit_timer sk=cfd889a0 1 when=0x3b4a, caller=c01e0748
reset_xmit_timer sk=cfd889a0 1 when=0x3a80, caller=c01e0748
reset_xmit_timer sk=cfd889a0 1 when=0x398a, caller=c01e0748
reset_xmit_timer sk=cfd889a0 1 when=0x389e, caller=c01e0748
reset_xmit_timer sk=cfd889a0 1 when=0x37b6, caller=c01e0748
It's a UP system with no kernel patches, running an eepro100 card.  I did
not get these errors under any of the 2.4test kernels.  Should I be worried?
Best,
