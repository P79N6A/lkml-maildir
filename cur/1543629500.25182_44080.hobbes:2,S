This was pending stuff, and why I wrote that the start command tcq = 1
stuff was a gross hack.

This is still ugly, IMHO. What I wanted was to split the udma->
function into two parts, one that acts on a request (ide_dma_read,
ide_dma_being, etc -- and then also ide_dma_read_queued) ad one that
does the silly stuff like ide_dma_check etc. Then unify the tcq and
non-tcq stuff so that udma_rw->(dma_act, drive, rq) always returns
ide_started or ide_stopped (or ide_released) and kill the #ifdef above.
I don't think udma_tcq_taskfile() should be public like this, and btw I
think the name really SUCKS! :-). ata_tcq_dma() is much better for
instance, even though it should be a private stratey. BTW, this goes for
all your tcq.c renaming.
