mmiotrace isn't targetted at fairly or technical users, its whole 
usefulness is that you don't need a kernel re-build, the distro kernels 
all contain enough support for us to just get a user to grab mmiotrace, 
run make and get a trace.... so in my eyes this a major feature regression 
to have to go back to custom kernel builds...

Which has been happening for how many months? perhaps if we merge 
mmiotrace in 2.6.25 we can clean up this function, otherwise I just count 
it as a feature regression...

I just reverted Christophs patch I didn't try and work out if the old code 
had problems no one has fixed...
So all distros with 2.6.24 kernels are useless to mmiotrace I don't see 
why leaving things as is until a suitable replacement mechanism can be 
used.. I've heard others give out about this also madwifi and SuSE kernel 
folks...
