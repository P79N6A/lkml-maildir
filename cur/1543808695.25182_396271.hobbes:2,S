Can you strace vs. ltrace and see if the gettimeofday or clock_gettime
syscalls are ever called ? I wonder if you have a glibc new enough to
use the vDSO to obtain the time or if it's using the syscall... The vDSO
on ppc32 is very new.
Also, are your kernels built with ARCH=ppc or ARCH=powerpc ?
Ben.
