The logical conclusion of that is to replace the entire kernel tree with
#error "compiler or program might have a bug. Aborting"
The kernel is NOT some US home appliance festooned with 'do not eat this
furniture' and 'do not expose your laserwrite to naked flame' messages.
The readme says its been tested with egcs-1.1.2 and gcc 2.95.
The same people who can't read documentation will just mail the list with
'it doesnt compile, help' or 'it doesnt compile, you suck' in less enlightened
cases/
Large numbers of people routinely build the kernel with 'unsupported' compilers
notably the pgcc project people and another group you will cause problems for 
- the GCC maintainers. They use the kernel tree as part of the test set for
their kernel, something putting #ifdefs all over it will mean they have to
mess around to fix too.
