What is even harder to find out given a binary kernel is which patches (if
any) have been applied to it. What if there was one file (say,
/usr/src/linux/patches) to which each (well-behaved) patch would append a
line or two (patch name, version, author, url), and then you could later
extract that information the same way you extract .config?
Figuring out what patches have been applied can be hard even given a source
tree, so this could be useful even without the data-in-bzImage thing.
