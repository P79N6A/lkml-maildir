Could be used yes.

You can always extend it with more elf notes.

At least the debugging register access is not that simple. The exception
handler has to be changed into an interrupt gate (to avoid interrupts
messing up the state) and then the debugging msrs have to be saved before
doing any other jumps. Worse they are CPU specific (P6, P4, and Athlon
have it different MSRs. You probably don't want that overhead
for normal page faults (reading MSRs is quite costly), so it would need 
special entry points and could be only done for GPF etc. not for normal
segfault. Still I think it would be worth it.
More state that could be saved are all the %dr* bits for hardware breakpoint
exceptions.
