OK, checked that after downloading Vanilla 2.6.10 from kernel.org
My local tree which was built incrementally since 2.6.8 or so has an extra function:

Above are the only differences between both trees and I have not touched i387.c
Looking at earlier patch logs, the 15 line offset appeared first with 2.6.10-rc3
and there were no rejects.
Would you happen to know when this function was removed?
 Thank You
 Michael
