My only thought was that the intent must have been to allow compilation of a driver
that checks for DMA at runtime (via dma_supported).  But, I guess dma_supported is intended
as a platform-level check?
If the DMA availability is at the arch level then such a driver could
use (albeit ugly) compile flags to cover that situation...?
Well, either way is fine with me.
