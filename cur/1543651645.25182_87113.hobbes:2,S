Hi,
	Re: Anybody know why I'm not getting 160MB transfers ?
	It might interest people to know the end story -
	After much fiddling around with cables/terminators, banning
	the SCSI-2 devices(DVD + DAT) to their own adapter and updating
	every piece of BIOS firmware in sight, I was still getting nowhere.
	So, (deep think) I threw a vanilla 2.4.19 onto the machine and
	LO and BEHOLD, I'm getting 160MB transfers!
	Well (hope Dave Jones is listening!,), it seems as though
	the Suse 8.1 kernel 2.4.19 has (yet another) problem.
	Cheers
	Margit Schubert-While
