One thing I find suspicious is that my ISP was down yesterday morning, causing
pppd to try repeatedly to connect. It seems it attempted to connect over 3,000
times while the ISP was down. Every connection failed at the PAP
authentication stage.
Perhaps there's a memory leak in the pppoe connection initiation process?
Even so that would be about 4k per pppoe connection attempt. Hm, a page?
