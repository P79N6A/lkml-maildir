I'm not so sure that it a usb problem.  Remember that acpi=off also
fixes the problem - but also result in the black void of death as I've
come to call it.  I would not be surprised whichever way this one goes
(bug in kernel or bug in hardware).
As for loading the modules i8042, atkbd and psmouse (in that order):
black void of death.
