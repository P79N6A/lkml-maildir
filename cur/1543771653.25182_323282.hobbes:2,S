Full dmesg attached - 2.6.12-rc5 seems to use pmtimer.
From 2.6.12-rc5 -
---------------------------------------
Jun  5 10:04:04 tux-gentoo [    0.000000] time.c: Using 3.579545 MHz PM timer.
Jun  5 10:04:04 tux-gentoo [    0.000000] time.c: Detected 797.956 MHz 
processor.
Jun  5 10:04:04 tux-gentoo [   14.020805] time.c: Using PIT/TSC based 
timekeeping.
And from 2.6.11-gentoo 
---------------------------------------
May  3 22:31:03 tux-gentoo time.c: Using 1.193182 MHz PIT timer.
May  3 22:31:03 tux-gentoo time.c: Detected 1994.883 MHz processor.
The differences in PM Timer MHz - is something wrong there? They seem to be 
dependent on processor MHz which is 797 MHz (lowest cpufreq) in 2.6.12-rc5 
and 1994 MHz (Highest cpufreq) on 2.6.11.

Could it be that the music players use gettimeofday() for time keeping? Sure 
enough they are broken with -rc5.
