I don't understand this idea, nor the patch for the problem.  I don't
see why adding a leap second would impact the kernel in any way. 
Shouldn't this be a simple zoneinfo change, whereby the last two seconds
of the year (in each timezone) both map to 31dec2008 23:59:59?  That's
the way the change has worked in the real world.  Why would ntp or the
kernel be involved?
