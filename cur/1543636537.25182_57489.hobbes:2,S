Patches for 2.5 can be found here:
        
http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/patches/packet/2.5/
The most recent patch is for 2.5.25. As far as I know, there are only
two remaining problems with the 2.5 patch:
1. Some drives require a "synchronize cache" command to be inserted
   before a read command if the previous command was a write. This is
   implemented in the 2.4 patch in a rather ugly way, but not in 2.5.
2. The 2.5 version uses "bio" objects instead of buffer_heads, so the
   2.4 functionality to fill in missing parts of packets with data
   from the buffer cache doesn't work. This affects performance but
   not correctness.
Jens thinks the cache sync commands should be handled at the level
below the packet writing module, in ide-cd.c and sr.c. I agree, but
haven't implemented it simply because I haven't figured out how to do
it yet.
Regarding the use of cached data for partial packets, Jens suggested
using the page cache instead of the buffer cache. I haven't figured
out how to do this either.
