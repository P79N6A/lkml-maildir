The OOM problem is completely unrelated to the network, therefore no 
reset should ever be considered for this condition.
The driver should properly handle the 'NULL in rx ring' condition as a 
normal occurence.  It should skip to the next available skb in the ring. 
  If no skbs are remain, it should drop the skb.
See natsemi.c for additional -- and optional -- OOM handling techniques.
