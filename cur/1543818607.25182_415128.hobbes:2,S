thanks a lot for doing this!

Serge, your testing approach looks really strange for me.
First of all, you selected the worst namespace to check performance 
overhead on.
1) uts_ns is rarely used and never used on hot paths,
2) also all these test suites below doesn't test the code paths you 
modified.
So I wonder what was the goal of these tests, especially dbench?!
Thanks,
Kirill
