Whoops, good point.  It was a very old and half-arsed attempt at doing
expanding truncate to no-holes filesystems (mostly the fat flavors).
reiserfs likes it because it needs to insert zero'd out indirect items for
holes.
I've got the bits to make fat use it too, the only real gain being able to
save staroffice files onto fat.
