It isn't ;) At least I don't think so for the minix-derived ones
I've seen. But no matter, this is going a bit off topic anyway.

I don't know what this is solving? You don't need to run all reclaim
from kswapd process in order to limit concurrency. Just explicitly
limit it when a process applies for PF_MEMALLOC reserves. I had a
patch to do this at one point, but it never got much testing -- I
think there were other problems iwth a single process able to do
unbounded writeout and such anyway. But yeah, I don't think getting
rid of direct reclaim will do anything magical.

Directly getting back pages (and having more than 1 kswapd per node)
may be things worth exploring at some point. But I don't see how muchi
bearing they have to any deadlock problems.

I don't think you'd need to do anything remotely fancy ;) Just so long
as it can allocate a swapcache entry for a single page to write out, that
page will be written and eventually reclaimed, along with its radix tree
nodes.

I guess it would still have all the same theoretical holes, and some
could surely still be tickled, yes ;)
