Why do you want to use /10 prefix for link-local address ?
RFC2373 defines link-local address format as below.
   |   10     |
   |  bits    |        54 bits          |          64 bits           |
   +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+
   |1111111010|           0             |       interface ID         |
   +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+

If you wan to use /10 prefix for link-local address, you can add the
link-local address with /10 prefix to interfaces and routing table
manually at your own risk, but it should not  be a default behavior.
