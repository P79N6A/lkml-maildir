Hi,
I'm using the linux kernel 2.6.10 and busybox 1.0 on a AMD AU1550 board.
When I copy a big file (around 300M) within an ext2 filesystem (even on
ext3 filesystem) then the output file is sometime "corrupted" (I mean
that the source and the destination files are different and thus
generate a different SHA1).
Does somebody have a same behaviour?
Thanks,
David
