Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/1/21/201

For the bridge list, I just setup the list up so all non-subscriber messages
have to be approved by the list maintainer.  This adds a slight delay until
I get a round to approving the message; but seems like a fair compromise
to keep everyone else from reading the spam.
After the first message, I also put the person on the "approved senders"
list so the discussion can continue unhindered.
Also, listing just a mailing list (with no human) contact seems pretty
vague.
