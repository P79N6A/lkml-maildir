The "MAINTAINERS" list claims that there are "several" maintainers 
for the kernel-janitors submitted patches and the readme on 
kerneljanitors.org (
http://www.kerneljanitors.org/README
) lists a 
few folks.  Copying the originating maintainer/list is recommended 
in one of the kerneljanitor faqs. Some groups seem more receptive 
to these kind of fixes than others, though they may just be more 
active maintainers.  
I don't know if anyone does or doesn't roll these up collectively, 
maybe the list can advise...
