Subject: [GIT PATCH] USB fixes for 2.6.21-rc5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are some USB fixes against 2.6.21-rc5.
These patches fix a number of reported problems and compiler warnings in
the current tree.
Yes, hte omap_udc. and uhci patches seem a bit "big" but both David and
Alan ensure me that they are correct and needed for the 2.6.21 final
release.
All of these have been in the -mm releases.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-usb-devel mailing list, if
anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
