Sounds like Open Firmware.  It was designed for *exactly* this problem:
initializing a peripheral at boot time on multiple platforms.  I don't
know who all jumped on that bandwagon but a lot of PowerPC people did
(I know of PowerMacs and some RS/6000s).  Intel platforms (surprise!)
never bothered....
