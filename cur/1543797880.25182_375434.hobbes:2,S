Hi Maciej
I missed this announcement (been on leave for a while). This SCHED_BATCH 
implementation is by Ingo and it it is not "idle" scheduling as I have 
implemented in the staircase scheduler. This is just to restrict a task to 
not having any interactive bonus at any stage and to have predictable 
scheduling behaviour I guess.
Cheers,
Con
