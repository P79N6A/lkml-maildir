The Xscale is a fairly special beast, and it's context-switch times are 
pretty slow by default.
Here are some context-switch times from lmbench on a modified 2.6.10 
kernel. Times are in microseconds:
cpu		clock speed	context switch	
pentium-M	1.8GHz		0.890
dual-Xeon	2GHz		7.430
Xscale		700MHz		108.2
dual 970FX	1.8GHz		5.850
ppc 7447	1GHz		1.720
Reducing the Xscale time by a factor of 30 would basically bring it into 
line with the other uniprocessor machines.
