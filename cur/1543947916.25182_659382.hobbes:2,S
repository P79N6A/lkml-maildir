Then, how about reserving everything from the end of conventional memory
up to the 1Mb mark? Like this:
/*
 * The BIOS places the EBDA/XBDA at the top of conventional
 * memory, and usually decreases the reported amount of
 * conventional memory (int 0x12) too.
 */
static __init void reserve_ebda(void)
{
        unsigned int lowmem, ebda_addr;
        /* end of low (conventional) memory */
        lowmem = *(unsigned short *)__va(BIOS_LOWMEM_KILOBYTES);
        lowmem <<= 10;
        /* start of EBDA area */
        ebda_addr = *(unsigned short *)__va(BIOS_EBDA_SEGMENT);
        ebda_addr <<= 4;
        /* Fixup: bios puts an EBDA in the top 64K segment */
        /* of conventional memory, but does not adjust lowmem. */
        if ((lowmem - ebda_addr) <= 0x10000)
                lowmem = ebda_addr;
        /* Fixup: bios does not report an EBDA at all. */
        /* Some old Dells seem to need 4k anyhow (bugzilla 2990) */
        if ((ebda_addr == 0) && (lowmem >= 0x9f000))
                lowmem = 0x9f000;
        /* Paranoia: should never happen, but... */
        if (lowmem >= 0x100000)
                lowmem = 0xa0000;
        /* reserve all memory between lowmem and the 1MB mark */
        reserve_early(lowmem, 0x100000, "BIOS reserved");
}
