Subject: [PATCH] power: stop pda_power from requesting shared a IRQ as IRQF_DISABLED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/18/76

IRQF_DISABLED is not guaranteed for shared IRQs. I think power_changed_isr
doesn't need it anyway, as it only fires a timer.
This patch enables IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM instead.
