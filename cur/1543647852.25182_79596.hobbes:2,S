Rather depends on the filesystem.  ext3 does its own write scheduling,
and does stuff inside lock_kernel().  It needs a couple of scheduling
points I guess.
I'd expect ext2 to work OK with preemption, but nobody has really
looked yet.  Unless you're using ftruncate() (grr.)

Well 2.5.41 had the big change to the truncate code, which was
a rather important part of this whole effort.  I can't immediately
think of a 2.5.42 change which would do this...
But nobody has really got down and dug out the toolkit on
2.5 scheduling latency.  I guess I should do that soon.
