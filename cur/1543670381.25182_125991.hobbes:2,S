Actually, any where the arguments to && are already boolean (pretty
common) and have no side effects (pretty common) will be equivalent
and could very well result in the same code. Only the simplest cases
are interesting anyway, otherwise the branchless & obfuscation is a
loss due to extra evaluation.
