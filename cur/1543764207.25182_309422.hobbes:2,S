One of these patches introduced two regressions on my Thinkpad X31 with
"ATI Technologies Inc Radeon Mobility M6 LY (prog-if 00 [VGA])":
1. When resuming from S3 suspend and having switched off the backlight
with radeontool the backlight isn't switched back on any more.
2. I'm using fbcon as my primary work environment, but tty switching has
become _very_ sloppy, it's at least a second now, while with 2.6.11 it
was as fast as a few ms. Is this caused by the "proper PLL accesses"?
Cheers,
