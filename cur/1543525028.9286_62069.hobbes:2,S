Hi,
Thanks for your response. The program I am
using it is not actually a test program it is called
GAMESS, It does quantum chemistry calculation and is 
relatively big, I do not have any problem if you 
would like to examine it let me know how would you 
like to do it.
About the glib version, I think I am using libc-2.1.2.so
that's what I get with
ls -l /lib/libc*
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root      1008844 Sep 10 00:42 libc-2.1.2.so*
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           13 Jan 19 18:48 libc.so.6 ->
libc-2.1.2.so*
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           17 Jan 19 18:48 libcom_err.so.2->
libcom_err.so.2.0*
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root         5516 Sep 27 22:58
libcom_err.so.2.0*
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root         9424 Sep 10 00:42
libcrypt-2.1.2.so*
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           17 Jan 19 18:48 libcrypt.so.1 ->
libcrypt-2.1.2.so*
and 
I also have the 
/usr/i386-slackware-linux-gnulibc1/lib/libc.so.5 -> libc.so.5.4.46
About the filesystem, you are right, it is ext2.
I do not know if this may help on something. I am using the
same code compiled in a AIX RS6000 and the program creates
this large files and completes the calculation correctly.
Thanks you very much!
