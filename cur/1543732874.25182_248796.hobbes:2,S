I've moved lib/zlib_inflate over to generating the table.  But, in
trying to test it, I haven't been able to find anything that will
actually use this (it appears that using this static table was something
that pkzip introduced long ago as an alternative method of good
compression / speed) so I can't actually test it.  But the image size is
back in line.
