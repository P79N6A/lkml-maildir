Dear all,
I was looking at the ./mm/rmap.c .. I found that, in function
"page_referenced_one()",
   struct mm_struct *mm = vma->vm_mm;
was being refererred without NULL check.
Though I do agree that this works for most of the cases, I thought it
is better to add
BUG_ON() for case of mm being NULL.
attached is the patch for this
thank you in advance for taking your time.
best regards,
