Hi all,
I'm trying to find out how linux kernel calls scsi_dev_init  function
after kernel image is loaded.
I got information  from web that , the sequence is,
"init() will call do_basic_setup() which inturn will call
        device_setup()-> scsi_dev_init()->scsi_init()"
/* init() and device_setup() are definied in main.c */
But I'm not able to find out the function call for device_setup()
(defined in /usr/src/linux-2.4.2/drivers/char/pcmcia/serial_ cb.c)
function from  do_basic_setup() function.
device_setup function is not at all calling any scsi related functions.
Could anyone please tell me the flow of how scsi_dev_init is called,
which inturn call what are all the functions?
Could you please provide the the location of the file where the
scsi_dev_init  and  scsi_init function is defined?
/* In  linux-2.4.9 kernel, I'm not able to find  out function
device_setup and also the file serial_cb.c
Any ideas?  */
Thanks ,
Kousalya
