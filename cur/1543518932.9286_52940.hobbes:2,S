No, you can not just remove update_vm_cache call. It's relict of deep VFS
rework (near 2.3.18 or something). If module calls update_vm_cache then
it should be manually reworked for new VFS model. Looks like ntfs, affs
and qnx4 are orphan now (if they was not accomodated to new VFS for half-year!)
and should be removed from 2.4 :-/ It'll be sad things since at least ntfs is
usefull sometimes ...

I can try to find Linus's message on subject in archives but general idea was
simple: it's functions from libgcc.a and even if you can just put them in
kernel it's far better to review places where they are used and try to avoid
such manipulations -- if such functions are not inlined this means that they
are SLOW and gcc authors was unable to develop fast inlineable version. Last
place where slow functions are needed is kernel. Of course if there are no way
to redo calculations without such functions you can try to convinience Linus
(if such calculations are not on common path, for example) but it's REALLY
hard task.
