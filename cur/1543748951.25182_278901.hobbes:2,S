I have got a power measure device from university and experimented myself.
I keep it short: running SETI (in constrast to nothing, i.e. HLT insns),
only costs me 17 more Watts. With a price of 6 cent per kWh, this makes 
roughly 5.54 EUR per year when the machine is on 16h/340days.
(The theoretical case of 24/365 would make up 8.91 EUR.)
Wait, did not Intel pull back some processors because of their enormous heat 
of some P4 (which melted some)? Well, I guess *there* is all your $$ going.
