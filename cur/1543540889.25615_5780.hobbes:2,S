Context: 2.4.0-test1-ac22-class (2.4.0-test6-pre1 hangs on boot)
         Debian (woody)
	 AMD K-7 (Athlon)
I have my inittab set up for 10 consoles, leaving 11 for X and 12 unused. I run
"openvt -- ls -l" and it runs on 12. I switch to 12 to look at it, then switch
back to 5 (where I started it) and run "deallocvt". I now can not switch to 12,
but I can still switch to 1-10 and 11.
The Bug
-------
If I switch to 11 (X), then attempt to switch to 12, it *does*, and it's a
blank console. I can now switch to 12 from 1-10 and 11, and they all go to a
blank console. If I run "deallocvt" again, I now can no longer switch to 12
from 1-10, but I can still switch to it from 11, and the whole thing starts
over if I do.
Whoever reads this message, please tell me what other information is needed
and what I can do to further test this bug.
