Hi Marcelo, 
This patch set contains the biggest recent change to ext3: a change to
the way it deals with other dirty buffers in the system, making it
robust against things like dump(8) or tune2fs(8) playing with the block
device on a live filesystem.  This patch has been in ext3 CVS for some
time now.
I'll follow up with the other smaller fixes and tweaks in the next
batch.
