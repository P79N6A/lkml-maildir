While I lack specific Fedora knowledge and thus can't provide exact 
details for it I'd say it should still be pretty simple to recover. On 
Slackware I'd simply boot a kernel from the install CD and tell it to 
mount the installed system on my HD, then you'll have a running system and 
can easily clean out the broken modules etc and install the original ones 
from your CD and be right back where you started in 5 min. Surely 
something similar is possible with Fedora, reinstalling from scratch (as 
he said he did) seems like massive overkill to me.
