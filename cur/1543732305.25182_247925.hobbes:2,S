Nigel pointed out that the earlier patches contained attributions that
are not present in this patch. The 2.4 patch contains:
  Nov 5 2001, Aug 8 2002. Modified by Andy Polyakov
  <appro@fy.chalmers.se> to support MMC-3 complaint DVD+RW units.
and Nigel changed it to this in his 2.6 patch:
  Modified by Nigel Kukard <nkukard@lbsd.net> - support DVD+RW
  2.4.x patch by Andy Polyakov <appro@fy.chalmers.se>
The patch I sent you deleted most of the earlier work and moved the
rest to cdrom.c, but the comments were not moved over, since the
earlier authors didn't modify cdrom.c.
Nigel wants to get credit for his work though, so were should we put
those messages? Is this patch acceptable?
