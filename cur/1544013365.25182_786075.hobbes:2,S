I guess I forgot to make my main point, I'm not arguing against your patch
at all, but would also like to see another patch to headers_check.pl that
warns about all instances of the __asm__, __inline__ and volatile keywords,
possibly with a list of known good cases.
Since you already have on the patch to warn about the extern declarations
and Sam submitted a respective patch for the CONFIG_ symbols, it would be
good to add these keywords to the same check.
Your headers_install.pl patch is required for correctness with pedantic
compilers, while the one I suggest would only help reducing the leak
of kernel internal code into user space headers.
