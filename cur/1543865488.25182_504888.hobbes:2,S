Though I am more convinced that looking at mm *at all* (either to
take the mmap_sem and find the vma, or to take the mmap_sem and
run get_user_pages) is going to hurt.
We'd have to special case kernel threads, which don't even have an
mm, let alone the vmas... too ugly.
I'll revert to my temporary-page approach: at least that will
fix the problem.
