I didn't say "no".  I'm just warning you that you've chosen a hard road
to hoe, particularly with the limited life of 2.4.

OK, I read it.
This is worrying:
"Even though the use of pure hotplug APIs is very appealing, I want to
propose
some deviation from this approach. If drivers rely on the PCI framework
to
discover adapters, we lose flexibility of registering controllers in a
particular order with the operating system."
Anything relying on discovery ordering in 2.6 is broken.
And so is this:
"An important MegaRAID feature is to be able to boot from any logical
drive on
any controller. Since persistent device naming is not prevalent in Linux
world
as of this writing, the order in which the devices are discovered is
very
important. We would like to continue to give users flexibility to
designate
any logical drive on any controller as the boot drive. As long as the
BIOS on
this controller is enabled, and only on this one :-), the chosen disk
would be
exported to the OS before any other disk."
If you require this functionality in 2.6, you should look at plugging
into the udev infrastructure.

Well, I cast a brief glance over it, the #ifdef structure is horrible
(and basically a product of trying to support 2.4).
This is unacceptable:
#if defined (__x86_64__)
		/*
		 * Register the 32-bit ioctl conversion
		 */
		register_ioctl32_conversion(MEGAIOCCMD, sys_ioctl)
#endif
The best thing to do would be to design the API to be 32/64 agnostic,
but if you can't do that, at least use the CONFIG_COMPAT infrastructure
that already exists.
