I would say yes.  But the system is basically broken if you have the
same interrupt line that needs both to be threaded and NODELAY.
Basically, the best I can think to have for such a case, is all
interrupt threads that have a shared NODELAY run at MAX_PRIO (99).  So
that they act like a NODELAY interrupt, in that they run over everything
else, but they can still schedule.
