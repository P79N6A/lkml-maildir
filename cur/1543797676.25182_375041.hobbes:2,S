Free sw and GPL is not about disrespect for intellectual property. We
want the GPL to be respected - as well as *enforced* when need be.
Free sw people tend to respect IP laws *more* than others - simply because
it is easier for us.  We don't need to choose between piracy
or paying through the nose for an os or an office productivity suite,
whe have all of this and more for free - legally.  Some of us take
pride in not pirating anything.

"The only place!"  Are you just trying to provoke?  Or can you tell me
what freedoms and rights I lack? I live in a democracy, I vote, I
have freedom of speech and press, I can leave if I'm not satisified anyway.
I also have the freedom of going wherever I want, any time of day, without risk.
If you wonder why some people have an anti-american attitude, try listening to
what they say.  It is usually about foreign policies, environmental problems,
or the actions of large America-based multinational corporations.

Criminals, which were eventually caught.  Seems to me America has enough
of their own criminals killing americans?

Excercising their freedom of speech?  It'd be sad if they couldn't.
If you love freedom of speech, then you have to put up with people
saying all sorts of things. Even things you don't like.
