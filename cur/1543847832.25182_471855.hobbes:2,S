OK, here is a bug fix patch fixing earlier "bug fix" patch :-(
[patch] hugetlb: fix linked list corruption in unmap_hugepage_range
commit fe1668ae5bf0145014c71797febd9ad5670d5d05 causes kernel to oops with
libhugetlbfs test suite.  The problem is that hugetlb pages can be shared
by multiple mappings. Multiple threads can fight over page->lru in the unmap
path and bad things happen.  We now serialize __unmap_hugepage_range to void
concurrent linked list manipulation.  Such serialization is also needed for
shared page table page on hugetlb area. This patch will fixed the bug and
also serve as a prepatch for shared page table.
