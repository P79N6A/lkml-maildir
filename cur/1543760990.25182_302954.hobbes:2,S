I'm assuming you're using a CF-to-IDE adapter to hook up the card. Most 
likely your CompactFlash card is indicating that it supports DMA and the 
kernel is trying to use it. However, many CF-to-IDE adapters don't hook 
up the DMA control lines properly so the requests all time out until the 
  kernel gives up using DMA.
We use some Mesa Electronics CF-IDE adapters at work - some of the newer 
ones have some jumpers with positions NOR and DMA, DMA works if the 
jumpers are set to the DMA position. I don't think we've tried using any 
DMA-supporting CF cards on the older ones without these jumpers.
If the adapter you're using doesn't do DMA, I believe that if you use 
options like hdb=nodma or ide1=nodma, etc. that will get the kernel to 
not try and use it.
