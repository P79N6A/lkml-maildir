Not only on reboot but always when sd is told to shut down. I did not 
notice an actual problem so far but I will keep an eye on it.
But AFAIU, sd's cache syncing (of devices with WCE set) is ineffective 
anyway if devices are unplugged without manually shutting the driver 
down beforehand.

Correct. Which is why I did not notice the bug until testing with scsiinfo.

Are they probing all devices or only those which are part of a RAID set?
