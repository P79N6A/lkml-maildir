Sorry,
I am not intended to do that. gmail's pop server has problem of not
sending response after final "." is sent. And my email client keeps trying
to send it out in thinking that sending failed.
Actually, I manually stopped it before you complain coz I was afraid it
sent duplicate copies, and check gmail account's outbox via web. It
seems that only one copy is sent out and I am relieved. But it is not
true, it did send 3 copies.
Sorry again.
