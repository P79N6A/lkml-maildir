I get a NULL kernel pointer reference with this patch with FRV in MMU mode.
It's whilst the kernel is attempting to execute init:
(gdb) bt

The problem appears to be that current->mm is NULL.  It's a bit difficult to
say for sure because gdb or gcc determined that the error is in pgtable.h, but
doesn't seem to have determined which one.
However, looking at the code, I think it must be this:
	static int do_anonymous_page(struct mm_struct *mm, ...)
	{
		...
		update_mmu_cache(vma, address, entry);
		...
	}
But that uses current->mm, which is NULL, via this function:
	[include/asm-frv/pgtable.h]
	/* * preload information about a newly instantiated PTE into the SCR0/SCR1 PGE
	cache */
	static inline void update_mmu_cache(struct vm_area_struct *vma,
					unsigned long address, pte_t pte)
	{
		unsigned long ampr;
		pgd_t *pge = pgd_offset(current->mm, address);
		pud_t *pue = pud_offset(pge, address);
		pmd_t *pme = pmd_offset(pue, address);
		ampr = pme->ste[0] & 0xffffff00;
		ampr |= xAMPRx_L | xAMPRx_SS_16Kb | xAMPRx_S | xAMPRx_C | xAMPRx_V;
		asm volatile("movgs %0,scr0\n"
			     "movgs %0,scr1\n"
			     "movgs %1,dampr4\n"
			     "movgs %1,dampr5\n"
			     :
			     : "r"(address), "r"(ampr)
			     );
	}
This really oughtn't to be called in this situation, I suspect.  I could just
skip the operation if current->mm is NULL, but I'm not sure that that's the
right thing to do.  Maybe I should be using current->active_mm instead.
Everything works fine without the patch.
