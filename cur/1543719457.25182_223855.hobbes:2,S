Subject: [PATCH] Lowered priority of "too many keys" message in atkbd
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch is from the Debian kernel package and I think it's valid
because this error doesn't cause any kind of malfunction of the system.
