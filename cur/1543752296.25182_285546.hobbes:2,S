This last bit is not too readable IMO. I'd suggest something like this 
instead : 
       If you care mostly about security and trimming bloat, say "N".
       If you care more about compatibility with old software (or if
       you will answer "Y" or "M" to BINFMT_AOUT below) say "Y".
       If unsure, say "Y".
