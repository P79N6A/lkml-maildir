ok clear, so no raid5 for 2TB+ then :(
looks like i have to remove some hd's then
what will be the limit ?
13*180GB in raid5 ?
or 12*180GB in raid5 ?
    Device Size : 175823296 (167.68 GiB 180.09 GB)
13* will give me 1,97TiB but will there be an internal raid5 problem ?
(since it will be 13*180GB to be adressed)
