The only potential hole I can see here is if there is an (exceedingly rare)
race where the page could be ejected after handle_mm_fault, then brought
back in but not marked dirty, before follow_page looks it up and returns a
page to be used for writing without marking it dirty.  Obviously this is a
ridiculously unlikely case.  But what I don't know is whether it is
strictly speaking impossible.  That is, that a page once dirty then later
not present, would ever again be present without also being dirty.
Thanks,
Roland
