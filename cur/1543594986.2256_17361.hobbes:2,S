Richard Stallman is the creator of the license. It's his greatest work.
Linus is in no way priviledged as to interpretation of it, other than
tolerance on the part of the parties that own the copyright to the
license.
The GPL is about "the program". As far as I'm concerned, modules are the
kernel, "the program".  The way to stem any panic that may exist, if you
want to allow binary-only modules (which sucks*, but whatever), is to LGPL
or "KGPL" the kernel. What is being allowed now is in violation of the
GPL.

*How 'bout a nice binary-only Forth running the kernel? Metacompiling
kernel routines into the Forth dictionary and such. Sound creepy? Good.
