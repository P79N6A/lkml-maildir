It used to do that, but doesn't any more in 2.6.10-rc2.  Check the
current code please.
vesafb now distinguishes between the amount of memory needed for the
video mode (that is used for ioremap() to avoid wasting address space,
reported as "using" in the kernel message quoted above) and the total
amount of memory (used for ressource allocation and mtrr records,
reported as "total" in the message above).

The problem isn't vesafb, the problem is the BIOS.
On my machines it works perfectly fine.  One has a radeon with 64MB, the
other a good old matrox with 8MB video memory.  On both machines current
kernels correctly create mtrr records for the complete framebuffer, not
just the small piece actually used by vesafb for the fb console.

Yes, but that also results in a slow framebuffer console.

Well, 2.6.10-rc1 + newer should get it right now.  We can't do much
about BIOS bugs through, other than maybe disabling mtrr by default
if too many machines are affected.
