I haven't tested it yet for a number of reasons. The most
important one is that the FreeBSD people have been playing
with this thing for a few years now and Matt Dillon has
told me the result of their tests ;)

True. I think we want something in-between our ideas...

Except that your code throws the random junk at the elevator all
the time, while my code only bothers the elevator every once in
a while. This should make it possible for the disk reads to
continue with less interruptions.

Indeed. IMHO we should fix this by putting explicit IO
clustering in the ->writepage() functions.
Doing this, in combination with *WAITING* for dirty pages
to accumulate on the inactive list will give us the
possibility to do more writeout of dirty data with less
disk seeks (and less slowdown of the reads).
