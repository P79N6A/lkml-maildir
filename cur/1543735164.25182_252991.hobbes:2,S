Thanks.

s/all/many/:
uname <0.000142>               uname <0.000217>		25% slower
brk <0.000176>                 brk <0.000174>		no change
open <0.000218>                open <0.000335>		33% slower
fstat64 <0.000104>             fstat64 <0.000191>	90% slower
or maybe strace simply isn't very accurate and adds signinficant
noise to the measured delta?

I recompiled 2.6 with HZ=100. It's not it.
Time is running normally too.
