Right. 
You trapped into the no apic on SMP trap. I did not come around to fix
that yet. What happens that you don't have lapic on the commandline and
BIOS has lapic disabled. Therefor Linux switches to IPI broadcasting if
the PIT interrupt, which does not work with idle_hz and highres timer as
those are per cpu. I will fix that for SMP kernels which bring up only
one CPU.
You can work around that for now by either using an UP kernel or
enabling local APIC, which is recommended anyway because the APIC timer
is faster to access and has longer max time than PIT.

Will look into that. Thanks,
