I did grep for "struct file_operations" in mm:
paolo@paolo-desktop:~/linux-2.6/mm$ grep "struct file_operations" *
shmem.c:static const struct file_operations shmem_file_operations;
shmem.c:static const struct file_operations shmem_file_operations = {
swapfile.c:static const struct file_operations proc_swaps_operations = {
Am I right in saying that both the files don't need to be modified?
There is nothing like:
struct file_operations xyz_ops = {
       ...
       .ioctl = xyz_ioctl
};
in there.
So I guess I need a smarter trick to find out which files need to be modified
as you previously suggested.
Ciao,
