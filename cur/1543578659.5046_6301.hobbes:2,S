I disabled both (I guess you meant the 'define TARGET_CPUS cpu_online' in
io_apic.c?), and reverted my own patch, added your patch... Now running with
the usual heavy network load, no problems so far... Also made USB produce
interrupts (shares irq with network), no problems...
Could this really be the solution?
