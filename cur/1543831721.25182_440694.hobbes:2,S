Note that ARM drivers generally require asm/irq.h by way of it defining
the IRQ numbers for the platform, so this patch moves the include of it
to linux/genirq.h.
Also note that including genirq.h (formerly irq.h) is broken for
architectures which don't yet use this stuff - it'll probably cause
compile failures because it wants asm/hw_irq.h.
