Can a kind of "compatablity mode" like the advanced router setup in the 
config, were different fixes/workarounds are listed and can be turned
on or off. This means that the kernel has work arounds for almost 
everything under the sun but most folks see only the slow down that they
have to due to local broken hardware on their network. This means that
Linux works and the true cause of the problem is also highlighted.
