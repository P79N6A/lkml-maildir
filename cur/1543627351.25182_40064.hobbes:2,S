   I'm not advocating more locking in read() -- there's no need, and it is
   quite important that it is fast!  But I would very much appreciate an
   understanding of the rules that relate reading, writing and truncating
   processes.  How much ordering & atomicity can I depend on?  Anything at all?
Basically none it appears :-)
If you need to depend upon a consistent snapshot of what some other
thread writes into a file, you must have some locking protocol to use
to synchronize with that other thread.
