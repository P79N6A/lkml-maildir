Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Add disk hotswap support to libata RESEND #2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hey Jeff, all,
The following is my latest attempt at re-doing the hotswap patches for
libata hotswapping.  This has some positive upsides:
- The patches seem cleaner
- The patches seem more multi-purpose and adaptable for use across all
controllers, not just the Promise ones.
- Jeff is more likely to accept them since most of his suggestions
have been factored in.
There is also a downside:
- The patches haven't been tested at ALL since I don't have any
hardware until September.
So, try at your own risk.  Everything seems sane to me, however it is
3:00 AM here.
Jeff, these patches are designed against 2.6.13-rc3-mm1.  As a result,
they are meant to apply overtop of the sata_promise 'support PATA
port' patch.
Please apply and try.  And send me comments about how the patches are
broken in weird scenarios.
Luke Kosewski
