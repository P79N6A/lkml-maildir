Just for shits and giggles, I updated kbuild 2.5 for 2.4.19-pre8.
(actually, I did this because sparc32 builds on that kernel and I am
going to start work to get that port underway and wanted a buildable
base to start with)
this patch is just the diff between 2.4.18 and 2.4.19-pre8
0) untar 2.4.18 and apply patch-2.4.19-pre8
1) apply kbuild-2.5-core-14
2) apply kbuild-2.5-common-2.4.18-6
3) apply kbuild-2.5-i386-2.4.18-2
4) then apply kbuild-2.5-common-2.4.19-pre8-update
I have only tested x86 as of this moment.  If anyone is dying for a
clean kbuild-2.5-common-2.4.19-pre8-1, let me know and I can turn those
wheels.  BTW, there are a few things that don't build on this kernel in
kbuild 2.4 as probably already reported on lkml.
