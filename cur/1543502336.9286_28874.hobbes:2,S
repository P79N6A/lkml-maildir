I think you didn't understand it. My patch against syncppp.c (and
net/core/dev.c) allows IFF_RUNNING to be set by the link protocol driver,
while IFF_UP is set by dev.c only. The reason for setting them together in
dev.c is that it should be compatible with the current way of things, when
IFF_RUNNING was set exacly when IFF_UP was set. My patch to syncppp.c
resets IFF_RUNNING when open and sets it only when the link protocol is
up. So it does exactly the thing you are talking about.
