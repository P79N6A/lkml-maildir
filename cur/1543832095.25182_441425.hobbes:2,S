Aha - we have a winner.
CONFIG_SCHED_MC was not enabled in this kernel.
Now what I see matches what it should.
    On a Hyper-Thread (but not Multi-Core) x86_64 system that I
    tested with CONFIG_SCHED_MC enabled, your patch was required to
    keep single-cpu cpu_exclusive cpusets from instantly locking
    up the system.
    On a Multi-Core (but not Hyper-Thread) IA64 Montecito system
    that did -not- have CONFIG_SCHED_MC enabled, there is no
    such problem with single-cpu cpu_exclusive cpusets in the
    first place.  It worked ok, even without the patch.
Thank-you.
