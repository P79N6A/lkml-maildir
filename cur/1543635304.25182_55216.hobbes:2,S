I personally have had loads of problems with Promise controllers, (there's one sitting in my cupboard at the moment, because I could never get it to work, and I was too busy to return it), and a friend of mine who runs an ISP returned some Promise IDE raid equipment, so I am begining to wonder if that is the problem.
If you are near S.E. London, you are welcome to borrow my Promise ATA/100 controller, and see if it helps.
I had a look at the Benq site, and they do have firmware upgrades:
http://www.benq.co.uk/ServiceAndSupport/Drivers/drivers.cfm?product=317
but I wouldn't immediately suspect that that would help.

On the same ATA controller?

That makes me strongly suspect at it it the ATA interface to blame.  Can you try the CD-writer on another one?

The list is pretty high volume, so if nobody is around who can answer your specific question at the time, it might get ignored.  Nothing personal :-).
