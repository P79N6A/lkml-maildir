Subject: 2.4.10-pre12 Missing EXPORT_SYMBOL?

All,
	I updated my kernel to 2.4.10-pre12, and upon 'make modules_install',
depmod reported a missing symbol: tty_register_ldisc, from ppp_async.
	I added a 'EXPORT_SYMBOL(tty_register_ldisc)' just after the
tty_register_ldisc definition in drivers/char/tty_io.c, and all was
well.
	Just FYI.
