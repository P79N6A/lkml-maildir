O.K. that sound more reasonable. I was reading image as program
text... and a 1.5GB program text is a something I never have seen (and
hopefully will never see :-)

I don't really see a reason for fs cache in the application. I think
that parallel applications tend to either share mostly all or nothing,
but I may be wrong here.

I think we fixed this misreading. 
But still IMHO you underestimate the importance of shared memory for a
lot of applications in the high end. There is not only Oracle out
there and most of the shared memory is _not_ locked.
