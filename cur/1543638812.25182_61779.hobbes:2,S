Petr,
Funny reading the code of udma_status in pcidma.c I see nothing that can
report the contents of busmaster register undoctored.  Only udma_stop
returns a binary state or that is all it can do.
Your point about about code familiarity is a lark.

The only time known when it returns a non 0xE7 maskable value or the inner
bits are set, is when you poke the dma engine when it is BUSY and/or EOT
has not occurred.  So clearly you have broken the EOT checks because
clearly it is not needed in broken host drivers.
Now, to hand you a clue bat!
I have observed this in the port forward into 2.5 also, and have seen
dma_status return on a simplex setup with 0xFF.  Now given that I have
correct EOT checks, and from a brief overview of 2.5 can not tell if
they are exist anymore, it can only mean that events are outside the model
of the DMA State Machine.
The result is if the inner two bits on the top and bottom nibbles are set,
the damn thing is busy and code is wrong on the calling events.
