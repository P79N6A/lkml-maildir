Funny.  How did you type the command to start bash?
If you can  arrange bash to be  run, then why is it  that difficult to
arrange "modprobe atkbd; modprobe i8042" to be executed?
Some distros even have the disk  driver and filesystem for the root fs
compiled as modules.  They do  manage to load those modules correct to
mount the rootfs.  How come it  is so hard to imagine that 'i8042' and
'atkbd' can somehow be loaded without user attention at boot time?
