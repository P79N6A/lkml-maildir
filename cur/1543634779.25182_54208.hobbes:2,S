Havent you heard? Thats what ACPI-support does on linux ;-)
So power off your SMP manually or accumulate uptime like the rest of us.
(actually ACPI is more stable om SMP machines that normal ones. My ASUS A7M-D 
dual Athlon is the only machine I have ever seen survive more than 5 minutes 
with an ACPI-kernel)
