Talk is not about wana-build-MCE-in, given to the user's sake. But about
flexible selection of this code, if it is really supported by CPU, when
user have it enabled (see winchip/preventium sub-thread). More work, it
is not such quick patch, certainly, but this is needed for famous i386.
I wonder, why such patch wasn't introduced long time ago. Modern
(cheap) chips have no MCE?
