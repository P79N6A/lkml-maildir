Hi,
	The current NFS over TCP client side code seems solid when using a
Solaris 2.6 NFS server, but when I mount a RH5.2 I can get it to die,
unfortuantely I can't get my syslog on a P133 to catch what causes the
problem ...
So if someone thinks they have a fast enough machine (probably doesn't
exist .. this is a lot of debugging :-)... )
get 2.2.0-pre7ac5 export /usr/src/linux or any other kernel tree to
localhost with no_root_squash
mount -t nfs -o tcp,nolock localhost:/usr/src/linux /foo
echo 67 > /proc/sys/sunrpc/rpc_debug
dmesg -n 1 (stops the stuff filling your console)
cd /foo ; make -j 4 menuconfig
for me this hangs on the parsing.... stuff of menuconfig ..
but I can never get all the log file info ..
How you know you've gotten all the info is that the numbers on the rpc
info are sequential ...  if someone thinks they have it could they send it
to me at airlied@linux.ie, if not no worries I'll hopefully figure it out
myself ...
I'm currently trying to get a PII I have here working with 2.2pre stuff
but IDE problems are bugging me ..
Thanks,	
	Dave.
