The resolution will always be limited.  That's the nature of digital 
systems.  Unlimited resolution would require real "real" numbers and 
that's not possible.  The nearest you get on a digital system is the 
floating point APPROXIMATION to real numbers.

I don't think so.  There are those (I'm not one) who insist that to do 
so would be a bug.
IMHO, as I've said several times, USER_HZ should be changed to be equal 
to or greater than HZ.  In fact, if having USER_HZ greater than HZ would 
still make it unusable for your purposes, I'd change that opinion to say 
USER_HZ should be equal to HZ (or, in other words, cease to exist).
