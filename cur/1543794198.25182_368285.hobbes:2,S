Unfortunately this soft lockup bug affects version 2.6.14-rt13 too :(
Stack traces are almost the same, except base addresses.
The bug was much harder to track down this time. Kernel detected a soft
lockup bug after about three days of uptime.
I noticed another strange behaviour. When I rebooted the machine
(actually pushing reset button, not CTRL+ALT+CANC or SysRq at all), it
became *very* slow. GRUB took up to five seconds to be fully loaded
(usualy it takes only a fraction of second) and the initial phase of
booting the kernel was about 4 times slower. Even after a power off this
behaviour was still present! Need more coffee?
Regards,
