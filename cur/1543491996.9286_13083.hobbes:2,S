Why not? Remember, the FSF does not have a monopoly on compilers.
Had gcc not been available, another compiler would probably have been
used. If that compiler was non-free, how long do you think it would have
taken until a (semi-)free alternative appeared? The availability of gcc
and other GNU software was just extremely helpful at the time. Without it,
Linux might have sizzled and died, but then again, it might not have.
The free software / open source community owes a lot to Richard Stallman
and the FSF, but not everything.
