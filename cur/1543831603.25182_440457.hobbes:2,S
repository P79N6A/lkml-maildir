Wouldn't such a scheme interfere with the block allocator algorithms,
and hence increase the risk of fragmentation? Schemes like this realy
put my hairs on end,
  1) if you don't want to lose your data, make backups; 
  2) if I mean to delete a file, I want it gone proper. Silently keeping
     it about is not unix like;
  3) don't aid third parties in recovering your removed data. If I want
     them to have it I'll give it to them.
