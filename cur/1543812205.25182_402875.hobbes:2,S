Agreed.
FWIW, as a PCI driver writer I've always wanted a one-call-does-it-all 
interface, where you pass in a struct that describes
* what BARs to map (pci_iomap/ioremap, pci_request_regions)
* irq handler (request_irq)
* enable bus mastering, MWI (pci_set_master, pci_set_mwi)
to collapse the billion-and-one pci_xxx calls into a single one that 
replaces pci_enable_device(dev) with pci_up(dev, &info).
