hi all,
i writing keypad driver on
*mx21 ads board  for
* kernel 2.6.14
i got a problem on interrupt handling ,
the isr routine for kpp
1.when interrupt occur first i disable interrupt by clear KRIE and KDIE bit
2.next i scan key pad matrix
3.clear KPDK bit  (but when i read this bit i can see that KPDK flag
bit is still not cleared)
4.then i enable KDIE bit again
all above 1,2,3,4 written within interrupt handler (is this a problem?);
my problem is KPP interrupt handler run over and over again after once
i touch a key and release it
please help
thanks
dilan
