That's quite nice when it works, but sometimes the proxy breaks.  Then
it really _sucks_.
You fetch a page and get a blank one or a different one.  "Reload" gets
you the same broken page.
As usual the way around these problems is to have yourself an account on
a box on another network.  Kinda defeats the point of having your own
"always-on" box at home.
