It's usually best to use the names / addressen in the MAINTAINERS file. 
Security issues like this are IMHO best first adressed to the maintainer 
of the code that is most likely to contain the bug.
I would suggest sending this to Dave Miller or Alexey Kuznetsov, both 
names which appear frequently when it comes to IP related stuff.
