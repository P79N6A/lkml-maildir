one other interesting note about this problem. it only occurs when the
PCI soundcard is writing 16-bit samples to the ADC buffer, never when
its writing 8-bit samples.
i have no idea what this could mean. oh, and the frequency is much
larger than i said last time - more like 10-20 times in 512 patterns.
