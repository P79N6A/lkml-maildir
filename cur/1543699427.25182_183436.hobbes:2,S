The problem is that between dropping the lock and usb_set_configuration (or
whatever) picking it up again, the device may be disconnected, so usb_set_configuration
needs to handle the case of being called after disconnect (it doesn't seem to
check for that right now, but I only had a quick look).  Also, after usbfs picks up
the lock again it needs to check for disconnect.  None of this is a big deal, but
it could all be avoided by a simpler change: provide a usb_physical_set_configuration
(or whatever), which is usb_set_configuration without taking dev->serialize.
Duncan.
