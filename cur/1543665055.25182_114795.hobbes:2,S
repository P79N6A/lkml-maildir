Subject: [PATCH]Fix to the new sysfs bin file support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I happen to notice the new binary file support in sysfs and had to take
for a spin.  If I understand this correct my write file will need to
allocate the buffer->data, but then I have no way of freeing that memory
since I don't get a release callback.
Here is a patch that:
* makes sysfs cleanup the buffer->data allocated by the attribute write
functions
* fixes a bug that causes the kernel to oops when somebody attempts to
write to the file.
BTW, would you be totally opposed to a patch that added open, release,
and ioctl to the list of functions supported by sysfs binary files?
Another question... How would a driver know that the various write and
read calls are coming from the same open, or would there be a way for a
driver to make it so that only one thing can open the sysfs file at a
time?
