Hello
If I set 57600 speed on Palm 100 USB/serial adapter (USB IDs 0x830, 0x80),
the speed is according to oscilloscope at 19200, but the tcsetattr
doesn't fail and subsequent tcgetattr returns 115200.
If the hardware supports it, the speed should be set to 115200. If it
doesn't, tcgetattr should then indicate 19200.
Linux kernel is 2.6.16.19.
