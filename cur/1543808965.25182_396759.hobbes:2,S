Almost.  I would still prefer madvise_vma to allow MADV_DONTFORK
on a VM_IO vma, even though it must prohibit MADV_DOFORK there.
But if Linus disagrees, of course ignore me.
Comments much better, thanks.  I didn't get your point about mlock'd
memory, but I'm content to believe you're thinking of an issue that
hasn't occurred to me.
