nfsd already wedged up and holds a lock, this is expected.
I'm not sure what you're doing here, but a viable work-around for now
might be to use nfsv2 mounts, something like
  mount -o vers=2 ...
or to keep v3 and disable readdirplus doing something like:
  mount -o vers=3,nordirplus ...
The later I didn't test but was suggested on #linuxfs.
