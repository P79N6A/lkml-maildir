Trust me, I would have finished it by now, but the most critical objective for me
(and hence the direction from my mgmt) is that SGI is able to ship UV systems when
they are ready, to customers who are buying them, to perform as they are expecting.
Nothing else comes close in priority.  I've already missed two merge windows,
missing a third and I may have to learn hara-kiri. ;-)  [And working up to 7 days
of 10-14+ hours per day, is not what one would normally think of as lazy.]
Thanks,
