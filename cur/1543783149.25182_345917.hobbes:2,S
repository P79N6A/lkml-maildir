Fair point!

Wouldn't need config option: there's /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
for the whole running system, compatibility check on the ELFs run, and
the infinite stack rlimit: enough ways to suppress randomization if it
doesn't suit you.

Okay - and you're implying that 3% comes from _using_ the shared page
tables, rather than from avoiding the fork/exit overhead of setting
them up and tearing them down.  And it can't use huge TLB pages
because...  fragmentation?
