The current rules don't permit this but any rule could be change. However
its unlikely. Current the earth rotation people do this twice a year if
neccessary. It is also too complex to predict significantly (ie years) in
advance when it will be neccessary because the complexity of the tidal
forces involved is beyond simulation.
