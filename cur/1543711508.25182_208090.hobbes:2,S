This is Paul's new spam filtering system. If you're getting this, you just need to acknowledge the email and you'll be on my valid sender's list. You only need to do this once. I've been getting 250-350 Spam per day, so hopefully this system will cut it all down. It only allows real people through, not spambots.
thanks,....paul.
