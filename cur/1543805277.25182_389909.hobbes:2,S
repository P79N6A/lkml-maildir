Thank you! This is a vote _pro_ a unified SCSI generic implementation for all
types of devices. The current implementation unneccssarily duplicates a lot 
of code.

On Solaris, the SCSI glue code (between hostadaptor drivers and target drivers) is 
really small:
/usr/ccs/bin/size /kernel/misc/scsi 
28482 + 27042 + 2036 = 57560
And if you check the amount of completely unneeded code Linux currently has 
just to implement e.g. SG_IO in /dev/hd*, it could even _save_ space in the 
kernel when converting to a clean SCSI based design.

Be careful: libscg is a _generic_ SCSI transport library.
Closing the eyes for anything but CD writing is not the right way.

Sorry, I see nothing related below.

Maybe I should enforce the official libscg device syntax in order to prevent 
this from working in the future.
Anyway: the fact that it may work is no proof for correctness.

In case you don't knw the story:
	Linus Torvalds once claimed that introducing SG_IO support for
	/dev/hd* would be acompanied with cleaning up DMA support in the kernel.
	At that moment it turned out that it did not help at all as /dev/hd*
	did not give DMA. Later this bug was fixed, but I am still waiting
	to see the proposed DMA fix for ide-scsi.

Depends on what you talk about. 
Since about a year, there is a workaround for the incompatible interface change 
introduced with Linux-2.6.8.1
On a recent RedHat system, cdrecord works installed suid root.
On a system running a kernel.org based Linux it has been reported to fail
because it does not get a SCSI transfer buffer.

Do you  want everybody to be able to read or format a floppy disk?
Ignoring usual security rules sometimes _seem_ to make life easier but usually 
does not. Just look in what kind of jungle Microsoft is just because that 
started to allow insanely things for the sake of "user convenience".

It may make sense to do something like this for the user logged into the 
console. In general it is a security problem.
