Dear Jens Axboe,
I had found a big difference of generic_make_request(struct bio *bio)
got message : sdb1: rw=0, want=...., limit=.....
*****************
** TEST 1
*****************
I used "MAX_XFER_SECTORS  4096" driver to do mkfs.ext2 with ARECA RAID 
volume sdb1.
and copy a big file (900MB) into sdb1.
If I copy this file from sdb1, the message rw=.... ,want=......, 
limit=...... will appear immediately.
When I reboot the system and used  "MAX_XFER_SECTORS  512" driver.
I copy this big file from sdb1, the message rw=.... ,want=......, 
limit=...... still appear immediately.
When I redo mkfs.ext2 with ARECA RAID volume sdb1 (used  "MAX_XFER_SECTORS 
512")
and copy the same file (900MB) into sdb1.
I copy this file from sdb1 again,the message rw=.... ,want=......, 
limit=...... disappear.
****************
** TEST 2
****************
When I do another test with "MAX_XFER_SECTORS  4096" driver
#echo 0 > /sys/block/sdb/queue/read_ahead_kb
#mkfs.ext2 /dev/sdb1
then copy the same file (900MB) into sdb1.
I copy this file from sdb1 again,the message rw=.... ,want=......, 
limit=...... disappear.
Even I redo "echo 4096 > /sys/block/sdb/queue/read_ahead_kb" with ARECA RAID 
volume.
The message rw=.... ,want=......, limit=...... never appear at my "copy 
compare" test script.
Now I can say the bug come from "block read ahead".
And this bug will certainly appear when do "mkfs.ext2" if read_ahead_kb 
value large enough.
Best Regards
Erich Chen
