Subject: [PATCH 27/52] get rid of smp_32.c and smp_64.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/3/298

This patch merges the copyright notices, and valuable
comments that were left back on smp_{32,64}.c. With that,
files are empty, and are deleted

+ *	Pentium Pro
+ *		None of 1AP-9AP errata are visible to the normal user,
+ *	except occasional delivery of 'spurious interrupt' as trap #15.
+ *	This is very rare and a non-problem.
+ *
+ *	1AP.	Linux maps APIC as non-cacheable
+ *	2AP.	worked around in hardware
+ *	3AP.	fixed in C0 and above steppings microcode update.
+ *		Linux does not use excessive STARTUP_IPIs.
+ *	4AP.	worked around in hardware
+ *	5AP.	symmetric IO mode (normal Linux operation) not affected.
+ *		'noapic' mode has vector 0xf filled out properly.
+ *	6AP.	'noapic' mode might be affected - fixed in later steppings
+ *	7AP.	We do not assume writes to the LVT deassering IRQs
+ *	8AP.	We do not enable low power mode (deep sleep) during MP bootup
+ *	9AP.	We do not use mixed mode
+ *
+ *	Pentium
+ *		There is a marginal case where REP MOVS on 100MHz SMP
+ *	machines with B stepping processors can fail. XXX should provide
+ *	an L1cache=Writethrough or L1cache=off option.
+ *
+ *		B stepping CPUs may hang. There are hardware work arounds
+ *	for this. We warn about it in case your board doesn't have the work

+ *	CPU and SMP problems "tough".
+ *
+ *	Specific items [From Pentium Processor Specification Update]
+ *
+ *	1AP.	Linux doesn't use remote read
+ *	2AP.	Linux doesn't trust APIC errors
+ *	3AP.	We work around this
+ *	4AP.	Linux never generated 3 interrupts of the same priority
+ *		to cause a lost local interrupt.
+ *	5AP.	Remote read is never used
+ *	6AP.	not affected - worked around in hardware

+ *		interrupts, we log only the first one and count the
+ *		rest silently.
+ *	10AP.	not affected - worked around in hardware
+ *	11AP.	Linux reads the APIC between writes to avoid this, as per

+ *		the C stepping chips too.
