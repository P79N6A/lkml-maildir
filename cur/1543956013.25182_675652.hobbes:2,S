Yeah, the add_memory() itself is supposed to be easily able to be rolled
back.  Say the machine didn't actually need the memory, it could just
give the memory back.  No danger of fragmentation or anything.
But, at the same time, we don't want to have this memory sitting there
being unused, but still being accounted for in the VM as real memory.
It's not in use, and making it look in use (by growing the zone spans)
could upset the VM watermarks.

Ahhh.  You're completely right.  I was confused by ONLINE and
GOING_ONLINE.  Thanks for the reminder!
