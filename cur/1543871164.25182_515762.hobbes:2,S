	What are you fixing specifically?  This looks like you are
reorganizing the exit path.  While stylistic differences can exist on
the choice of function exit, claiming there is a "fix" means there is an
actual bug.  Please clarify the bug so we can evaluate your change.

	Also, this change suppresses some paths to mlog_exit(), which
impacts people tracing.
	If there is an actual bug you are fixing, please tell us.  We'll
work with you to correct it.
