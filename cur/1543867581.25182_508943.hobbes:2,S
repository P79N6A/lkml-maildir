The difference is that you are selling it and not contributing back.
I think the legal term is something like distributing copyright
material without a license.

So most linux kernel developers chose to contribute to Linux because
they prefer something closer to the GPL's notion of open (assuming
your definitions are in the context of the legality of redistributing
the end result).
Don't take offence, but most of us don't _want_ the embedded
developers who contribute nothing back. Even if you tripled the total
Linux userbase, how would that be a good thing for anyone but yourself?
Now imagine if nobody contributed anything back.
The reason Linux is good enough that you chose in the first place is
because of everyone contributing back. Why would we want to undermine
that? My aim for Linux is not to have it shut down VxWorks, or to have
a huge userbase, but to be the best OS out there.
Maybe that helps explain the why others here don't share your opinion?
With that said, there are some reasonable free BSD licensed operating
systems out there that you can use without opening your source.
