You could just place the functions (each with its table) into separate .c
files, and place them in the library. The linker will then include them iff
they are referenced somewhere. OTOH, they _are_ all over the place right
now, so they could just be included unconditionally. Thinking of ways to
set up to have them included in case only modules use them makes me
shiver...
