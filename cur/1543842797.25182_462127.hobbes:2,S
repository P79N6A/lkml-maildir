Hi Ben,
The code is a bit tricky.  It uses function pointers for the various
register read/write methods.  For the 5780, I believe it will be
assigned a simple writel() and not tg3_write32_tx_mbox().  Can you
double check to make sure you have actually added the wmb()?
It's probably easiest to just add the wmb() in tg3_xmit_dma_bug()
before the tw32_tx_mbox().
