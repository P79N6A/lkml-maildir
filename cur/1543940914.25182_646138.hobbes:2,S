There is no spec I know of that completely defines "nodes" on x86.
Actually I think on Linux calls them that.
There is the ACPI 3.0 SRAT spec that defines memory affinity,
but I don't think it has any requirements about where the memory must be.
Even if there was a spec people who actually put in DIMMs tend
to violate it. It seems to be not totally uncommon to just 
stuff them all into the same corner of the motherboard to give 
a "tidy appearance" (for non physicists :-) and that usually results in 
memory less nodes.
Anyways this area is something that regresses regularly. I had
fixed it several times and tested all cases on SimNow, but after
some time it tends to bit rot again unfortunately. The people who
usually test kernels probably know where to put the DIMMs in.
Probably just happened again.
