This email list (linux-kernel) deals with Linux kernel internals,
and won't be a useful place to ask your question about sed.
I see several resources that look interesting for such questions
at the web page:
  
http://www.linuxlinks.com/Beginners/
Or perhaps this site:
  
http://www.linuxforum.com/
Good luck.
