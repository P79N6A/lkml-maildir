Hmm, indeed. Then I'm unclear what the problem might be here.

Clearly not. That is the way the user stack gets communicated to the kernel,
and it would cause problems at earliest in the next outer frame (which is in
user mode, so we don't care anyway). And I know I saw it unwind properly
through the sysenter code in other cases in the past.

.cfi_register is the directive equivalent to DW_CFA_register, saying that
on register is spilled to another (rather than to memory) - see the Dwarf2
(or Dwarf3) specification for details.
