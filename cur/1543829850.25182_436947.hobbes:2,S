On a Sony Vaio, after a suspend-to-disk and a resume, `hwclock' says
  The Hardware Clock registers contain values that are either invalid
  (e.g.  50th day of month) or beyond the range we can handle (e.g.  Year
  2095).
and after a reboot the machine takes a trip back to 1969.  Setting
CONFIG_PM_TRACE=n prevents this.
