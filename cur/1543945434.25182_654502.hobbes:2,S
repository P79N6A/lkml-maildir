And here's most of the cause:
000002b8 00000124 T early_ioremap
00001000 00001000 t bm_pte
00002000 00000004 T early_ioremap_debug
static __initdata pte_t bm_pte[PAGE_SIZE/sizeof(pte_t)]
				__attribute__((aligned(PAGE_SIZE)));
Double ouch. First, this isn't in BSS. Second, even though it's
initdata, the alignment slop won't get recovered.
Don't we have a special section for page-aligned crap so it doesn't
waste most of two pages?
