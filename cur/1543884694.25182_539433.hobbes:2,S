Correct. I will try to cook up some statistics for the next round
of results (been redoing cfs-v6, done cfs-v7 and then redone it
because of strange results and hopefully will do cfs-v8 tonight
as well as sd048 during the next days -- not easy to keep up with
you guys rolling out new versions ;-)

Right. I'm really very surprised but this remained while redoing both
LTMM/j1 (twice!) and LTMM/j3 with cfs-v6.
I don't really understand that and now think it shows some hidden
"fairness deficiency" that hopefully is corrected in cfs-v8. At least
cfs-v7 did behave differently.

Since it doesn't appear with any other scheduler tested I'd not rule
out a feature of the code.

Oh, I'm confident both are excellent scheduler. On the other hand
I find mainline isn't that bad either, at least for this type of
load.
Anyway, as I wrote above I'm continuing my tests and am collecting
data for the various scheduler. Presumably over the weekend I'll
mail out the next round.
Best,
Michael
