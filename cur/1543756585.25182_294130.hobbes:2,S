that's 13-18 microsecond worst-case delay from point of wakeup to the
point the woken up task has been context-switched to - pretty good for a
generic OS ;-)

your latency traces look perfectly fine, and the jack_test results look
good too.

ah, very good! Now that the setup is properly tuned for audio latencies,
you might want to try to push up the number of jack_test clients again,
to see how far you can go. Right now there's a ~50% DSP load with 14
clients, so maybe you can push it up to 20 clients. (for this test
you'll likely want to turn off all options in the 'Kernel Hacking' menu
- they increase overhead. Otherwise you probably want to run with the
current options, so that you can send me BUG and latency traces ;) )

ok.
