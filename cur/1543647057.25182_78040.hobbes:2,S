I was speaking more of madvise() and in general.  I know O_DIRECT does
not have a spec.  In general, Linux returns failures on things that many
other operating systems just consider hints (i.e. madvise()).

Agreed.  Partly why O_STREAMING is needed.
Remember not everything implements O_DIRECT, especially not some odd
device you are streaming into/out of.
I think Andrew summed it up: if O_DIRECT will work in your environment,
and you can rewrite your application, it is probably preferred. 
O_STREAMING is a simple solution to solve the pagecache waste which
requires one change to the application.
I did not intend for this to be an O_DIRECT vs. O_STREAMING thread.  A
lot of people agree we need something like O_STREAMING - despite never
being implemented, you can find its name referenced often in archives
via google.  A much more interesting argument is whether we should not
have an explicit O_STREAMING but instead an intelligent drop-behind
heuristic... but that is a 2.5 issue and the patch is for 2.4.
20% increase in kernel compilation is amazingly nice, for free.
