I'm dabbling with the rtl8180-sa2400 code to see if I can make it do
anything.  Right now most of my time is spent making it compile and
remotely legible.  The coding style is quite far from graceful.
Hopefully I can get it to at least transfer some packets and make more
use of the community to get into something of quality.  
I haven't worked with wireless drivers yet so thats a learning
experience but at least there are plenty of examples at this point.
