Yeep. But doing this will only be possible in few weeks, when
the corresponding setup code is really modularized and note
the current "ifdef whatever" buch of collected fixes.
However for certain your patch is a starting point and
we are in odd series anyway...

;-)... And the games they wan't to play on the data registers are
