Having never touched ncurses before, the first time I used it, I
was overwhelmed by its non-intuitiveness and overcomplexity, as
well as lack of features I deem critical and necessary but which
are mostly available as addon components which also complicate
the interface.  Namespace is horrible in ncurses AFAIC.  However
one thing that I did do, was get line drawing characters working
the first time.  I did NOTHING special to achieve this.
I did find that when I changed my console font, that my line
drawing was toast.  It was also toast in midnight commander.  The
shell had (has?) absolutely nothing to do with it.  Read the
documentation for the console tools.  A default installed RedHat
system, works nicely.  If you play with fonts, or keyboard
mappings, etc.. you may end up hosing the line drawing stuff.
Keep in mind that line drawing characters are NOT ASCII AT ALL,
and are charset dependant.  Not everyone uses the same charset
either.
The only way that I know of to FORCE the issue, and it may not
even work - is to write to the RAW vcsa devices.  RHIDE does this
I believe.  You may need to implement a backwards compatibility
feature using "+" and "-", "|" characters for line drawing as
well.

The average end user customer is going to want a GUI point and
click interface with no text mode anyways.  If you want to
implement what you're looking for, I suggest looking at software
that DOES IT ALLREADY.  Midnight commander, and several other
curses programs illustrate this allready.

RTFM then, and quit whining.  You'll get much further with honey,
than with guns.  You'll also get much further along if you post
this to an appropriate UNIX programming list rather than the
kernel list, as it has absolutely nothing at all whatsoever to do
with the kernel.
