Argh! I just realize that this problem is really more in Ingo's RT
kernel, but I assumed that it was a problem in vanilla since the code is
more from the vanilla kernel.  With Ingo's spin_locks as mutexes, this
creates a problem on UP, but your are right, this is not a problem for
vanilla UP.

As mentioned above, this was a confusion of paradigms. I just got back
from Europe, so I'm blaming this on jetlag!  
OK a cpu_relax() may be better. So here it is :-)
