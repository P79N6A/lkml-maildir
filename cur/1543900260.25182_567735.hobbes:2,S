I suspected it was something about /dev populating, but I hadn't any 
clue on how to make it go on. To be sure, I've left it "hanging" 
(actually, it's not a completely unresponsive hang, SysRq works fine) 
for even 15 minutes, without any luck.
Could you please try to compile 2.6.22-git1 and see if you get an 
internal gcc error? It is in the first kernel-core related files, you 
should hit it too.
This evening I'll be able to be more precise about the exact file, I 
don't have the box here.
Bye.
