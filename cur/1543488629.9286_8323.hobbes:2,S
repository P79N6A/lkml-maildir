There just isn't a 1e4 factor difference between paging and overlays, I'd
be surprised if you get more than a factor of 2. And you could also tune
your program to be paging-friendly by clustering functions/data used
together... but I'd guess much of that happens semi-automatically by the
way source programs are laid out (you don't usually define totally
unrelated functions in the same source file, for one).

That it can _for typical programs_ means you have to be avare of the
pitfalls... and that kills the "nice, friendly, uniform model" idea that is
quite critical to the whole bussiness at hand.
