btw, please make sure to merge my patch, the original one had several
severe bugs.

fixing irq routing is even simpler, should be a three liner, I heard
somebody used kernel threads for it, that's certainly not needed
(btw, also for the irq routing I recommend you to merge my modified
version, the original one looked more to make P4 SMP look like a PIII
in /proc/interrupts not really to improve performance, performance
improves only if the irq stops trashing around and if it stops
overwriting the ioapic registers even if there's no routing change
required).
