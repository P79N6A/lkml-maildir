There are some fundamental problems with this model - the moment you mix
strict overcommit with anything else it ceases to be a strict overcommit
and you might as well use existing overcommit rules for most stuff
The other thing you are sort of faking is per user resource management -
which is a subset of per group of users resource management which is
useful - eg "students can't hog the machine"
I don't see that this is the right approach compared with the container
work and openvz work that is currently active and far more flexible.
