The main reason is to convert absolute dependency names to $(xxx)
followed by a relative name, where xxx is one of the KBUILD_OBJTREE or
KBUILD_SRCTREE_nnn variables.  This conversion allows users to rename
their source and object trees and to compile on one machine and install
on another over NFS without being bitten by absolute dependencies.  I
really need to do that conversion using the current values of the
kbuild variables, the variables might have changed on the next make.
My new design for module symbol versions requires that the version data
be stored immediately after the compile.  That also requires processing
after each compile using the current environment.
