Subject: 2.3.12 deadlock

Hi all,
When I compile 2.3.12 for SMP and run it on my UP PPro box:
1. Tux does not show on boot :-(     (I have matroxfb)
2. It occasionally deadlocks.
These two things do not happen when I compile it for UP.
Managed to gather some info:
- free pages 944kb (52*4 4*8 1*64 1*128 1*256), nothing wrong here
- current process: kswapd
- It keeps looping on: spin_lock(&tsk->mm->page_table_lock);
  in mm/vmscan.c
Don't know what's causing this. I believe an SMP kernel ought
to run on a UP box, right? Anyone clues? This isn't really my cup
of tea.
This deadlock is easily reproducable (within seconds); mail me
for more info.
Greetings,
Lennert
