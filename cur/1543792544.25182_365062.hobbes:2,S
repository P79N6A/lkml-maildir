  I was hoping that would be the solution too.  I just tried enabling
UART_BUG_TXEN to double check my previous results.  Somehow it makes the
problem much, much worse.  Instead of being the nuisance it usually is,
it seems like the UART gets way behind on transmitting bits.  So it
would probably prevent the unattended reboot stall since we kick it
every time we want to transmit, but it renders the UART completely
unusable as a console.  I can't even get it caught up enough to login
via the serial console w/ UART_BUG_TXEN enabled on the port.  Thanks,
	Alex
