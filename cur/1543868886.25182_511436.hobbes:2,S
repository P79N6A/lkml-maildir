Subject: Detecting section mismatches in vmlinux

Until 2.6.16 or so, we had reference_init.pl and
reference_discarded.pl to check section mismatches in vmlinux.
Are there any alternatives of this in recent kernel?
Now "modpost vmlinux" is executed during normal build, but it seems
the pass can not detect these mismatches.
For example:
$ ../build-i386/scripts/mod/modpost ../build-i386/mm/built-in.o
WARNING: ../build-i386/mm/built-in.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.data:initkmem_list3 from .text between 'set_up_list3s' (at offset 0x18382) and '__kmem_cache_destroy'
set_up_list3s() in slab.c is not marked as __init and it references
initkmem_list3[] which is marked as __initdata.  So it is not false
positive.  But "modpost vmlinux" does not report it.
