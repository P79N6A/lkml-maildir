  it come out of vger; apparently something went wrong. 
  Apologies if it's a duplicate ] 
Thanks to Jaakko.Hyvatti@iki.fi for the posting to fix rvplayer
version 5.0.0.45 I successfully patched my system so that it
works with the newer kernels.
The only remaining thing I found to be a problem on my system (well,
at least so far...) was the MIDI plug-in: ump.so
I have version 1.10 for Linux 1.2/2.0 with libc5.  Sure enough, taking a 
peek in the binary with gdb shows:
(gdb) disassemble open_output
Dump of assembler code for function open_output:
0x16ebc <open_output>:  pushl  %ebp
0x16ebd <open_output+1>:        movl   %esp,%ebp
0x16ebf <open_output+3>:        subl   $0x10,%esp
0x16ec2 <open_output+6>:        pushl  %ebx
0x16ec3 <open_output+7>:        movl   $0x0,0xfffffff0(%ebp)
0x16eca <open_output+14>:       pushl  $0x801
0x16ecf <open_output+19>:       movl   0x28,%eax
The 0x801 there is O_NONBLOCK flag (and write-only).
Killing the O_NONBLOCK with
 dd if=/dev/zero of=ump.so  bs=1 count=1 conv=notrunc seek=93900
took care of it.
Hopefully the info will be useful to someone on the list.
