That probably deserves a patch alone (see below), besides MAP_NOZERO. 
Basically, a new "exec uid" is added and such exec-uid is set only after 
the binary completed the detach from the old context. Ptrace check that 
uid also, and part of the may_attach() function.

Problem is, you end up with yet another pool to be looked up, flushed 
under memory pressure, etc..
