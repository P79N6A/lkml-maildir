Legally totally impossible under DMCA, EUCD and friends
That why the GPLv3 has the distributor of the software both give
installation info (a key authorized on the device, not necessarily a key
authorized on all devices or even the same key as the manufacturer), and
declare he gaves up any DMCA-like right to legally forbid installation
by the user.
