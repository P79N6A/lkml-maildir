That's what I was missing.  I can mount a Mac OS-X "Unix" filesystem
on the Linux 2.4.9-7 kernel supplied with RHL 7.2, but I have to
specify a type of ufs and supply both the ro and ufstype=openstep
options to the mount command.  Too bad about the lack of write
support, but I'm sure someone out there is working on that.  Thanks
for your help.
