You appear not to have read any of my mails on this topic.
Properly implemented metadata can:
  (1) operate in both modes simultaneously;
  (2) work with unaware applications;
  (3) provide performance enhancements to aware applications;
  (4) provide storage enhancements to both;
  (5) provide useful features that work with standard unmodified unix tools,
all at once.  That includes program copies.
