But this doesn't explain why I have two motherboards here where the HDD
activity LED does not light up in linux (for SATA drives) but does in
windows .  Note that it only starts working in windows *after* the
driver has loaded.  One is an ASUS A7N8X Deluxe (rev 1.0) and the other
an Abit NF7-S (rev 2.0), both with Sil3112 controllers.  On the other
hand, I have a DFI Ultra Infinity with a Sil3114 whose activity LED
works fine in linux.
