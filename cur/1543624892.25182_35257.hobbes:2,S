It kind of does for warm reboots. I'm getting more and more reports that
on warm reboot, the bios then can't boot again because we left some
hardware (usually the scsi or ide controller) in a state the bios didn't expect.
While I consider it a bios duty to reset the hw, using the device-tree for
clean shutdown of hardware at least would allow us to make it work.

Device owned notifiers could indeed go; the question is if
non-device owned ones (the only purpose of those would
probably cluster filesystems) should make a "fake" device or
keep using the current mechanism.
