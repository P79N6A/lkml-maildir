Alrighty. First of all, I redid the tests on both kernels. This time I ran
through them once before doing the tcp dump. This had the effect of loading
everything into the server's cache so that it can dish them out as soon as it
receives a request. This got arid of the 50 ms delay that was showing up on the
server side (down to 2 ms now). Now the NT delay is showing up clearly on it's
own (and is in the 110-190 or so range).
Here are the traces for the 2.2 and 2.0 kernel for transferring a file of size
1k. As always, server is host-210 port 3000 and client is host-232 running NT4.
Leading date is truncated for brevity.

Note how in the version for the 2.2 kernel, the NT timeout is present (142 ms)
but not being triggered in the trace for the 2.0 kernel.
When the file size is bumped to 2k, the situation is even more pronounced since
the NT timeout is hit 2x.

Once again, there are 2 NT delays here (190 and 193 ms) with the 2.2 trace
which aren't present in the 2.0 trace.
As always, let me know if you need any more info.
