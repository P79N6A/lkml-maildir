Subject: kapm-idled using 45% CPU (why not 100%?)

Subject says it all.  On my laptop which is running 2.4.0, while the
machine is completely idle "top" reports kapm-idled as usin about 45% of
the CPU.  The remaining 55% is reported as idle time.
When the machine gets a little more active, the CPU time attributed to
kapm-idled decreases while the 55% idle time increases to 85%!
This is not caused be "top": I get the same 45% from "ps -l 3".
I remember when kapmd was reporting 100%.  Is the new behaviour
intentional, and is it saving the maximum power on the laptop?
thanks,
