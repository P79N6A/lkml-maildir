There are three possibilities mentioned so far:
1) slow accounting - scan each attached VMA on each mmap/munmap
2) lazy accounting - the same as above, with the work all moved to the
LRU sweep
3) accounting with an extra page flag - still needs to scan VMAs on munmap
Christoph seems to prefer the third.
I wonder if we couldn't stick a rough counter in address_space to
fast-path the slow accounting - we'll typically only have 0 or 1 locks
active.
