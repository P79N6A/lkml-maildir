Patch follows beneath. On a related note, I'm not sure if this is right
(connecting to a daemon using TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT)

The SYN/ACK handshake appears to go well, and telnet reports a connection
(the daemon doesn't, no data has been sent). However, Linux keeps sending
SYNs, which keep getting ACKed. I'm not sure if this is desired behavior. It
appears to be a side effect of the TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT timeout implementation,
which seems to hijack the SYNACK_RESEND timeout.
Also, this timeout is not quite the number of seconds specified to
setsockopt, because of this.
Oh well: the patch
