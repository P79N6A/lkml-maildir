Subject: [2.6.20.16 review 10/28] rt-mutex: Fix stale return value
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Alexey Kuznetsov found some problems in the pi-futex code.
The major problem is a stale return value in rt_mutex_slowlock():
When the pi chain walk returns -EDEADLK, but the waiter was woken up
during the phases where the locks were dropped, the rtmutex could be
acquired, but due to the stale return value -EDEADLK returned to the
caller.
Reset the return value in the woken up path.
