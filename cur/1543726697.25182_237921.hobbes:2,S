Yes, thank you, the clear statement, that writes are not ordered, helps. 
:-) It is also relieving to read that data blocks are always preferred 
to parity blocks, so that data blocks never can become scrambled by 
unmatching other data blocks and parity blocks (at least in non-degraded 
mode).
Unfortunately, it still does not make me satisfied, because: The 
asymmetry of "all data blocks are correct, all parity blocks are 
suspect" should be exploited.
Consider 4 disks joined as RAID 5. There are 4 stripes (s0, s1, s2, s3), 
where s3 is the parity stripe.
    * <>Example 0: s3,s2,s1 are written to disk, while s0 is not written
      to disk for some reason. The system crashes. What happens at
      reconstruction? s3 gets replaced by s0 XOR s1 XOR s2. s0 contains
      old (read: wrong) data.
    * Example 1: s0,s1,s2 are written to disk, while s3 is not written
      to disk for some reason. The system crashes. What happens at
      reconstruction? s3 gets replaced by s0 XOR s1 XOR s2. s0 does not
      contain old data. The stripe which contains the old data (s3) is
      replaced anyway during reconstruction.
If we now consider, that for each disk (as member of a RAID 5), there 
are parity stripes and there are data stripes. Doesn't it make sense to 
prefer data blocks over partiy blocks when writing, just to get more 
cases of "example 1" against "example 0" than without this preference?
One could even imagine to intensionally postpone the parity block 
writing for some time in favour of peak throughput. The RAID 5 device 
looses its rendundancy for some bounded time at a bounded region of its 
space, but this may be acceptable for certain applications, I think.
