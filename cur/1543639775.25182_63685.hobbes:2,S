My only requirement is that the resulting rulebase is usable and roughly
the same, some small bugs are IMO acceptable.
CML2 has more problems than this. It's a very flexible but also very
complex language, which makes it hard to use. It was also not very wise to
create a complete new and different rulebase, which made it very hard to
compare both.
