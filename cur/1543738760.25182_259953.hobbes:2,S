hiya jon,
i'm placing _a_ version at 
http://hands.com/~lkcl/fuse.xattr.2.tgz.
it's the "mostly userspace" version, with hacked-up xattrs that "track"
what the userspace code does, inside the kernel.
due to having to implement fuse "getxattr" and friends in
kernel-space (in order to avoid having the -512 error message
returned to selinux/hooks.c), there are two locations in the
code where you must specify the proxy point:
1) example/fusexmp.c you must change "/home/sez" to your-directory.
2) kernel/util.c likewise.
in 1) it is the location where userspace file access occurs.  2) is
obviously matching the userspace xattr access.
i _do_ have a version of fuse where
pretty-much-everything-but-the-inode-allocation-which-is-done-in-libfuse-has-been-moved-to-kernel.
i've been examining a number of kernel modules (ncpfs primarily)
in an attempt to understand how to move libfuse's userspace
inode allocation system into kernelspace.
i'm tempted to abandon fuse and use lufs instead... that has a directory
cache in userspace but at least it appears to allocate inodes in
kernel (using iunique()).
hmmm...

Truth, honesty and respect are rare commodities that all spring from
the same well: Love.  If you love yourself and everyone and everything
around you, funnily and coincidentally enough, life gets a lot better.
