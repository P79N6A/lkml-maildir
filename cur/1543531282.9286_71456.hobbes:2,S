Why? Please explain what should happen instead. Process A is faulting,
and so requesting for RAM. No RAM is available and no RAM can be freed
because swap is full. The swap space process A "owns" is not there 
to fulfill its memory requirements, is there to honor *other* processes
requests. When process B requests a page-frame, the kernel may select one
of A pages as a victim. A pages get paged-out to free RAM in order to give
it to B. The same can happen with A and B swapped. But it's A request for
RAM when no RAM and no swap is available that triggers the problem.
So A gets hit.
I'm 100% in favor of overcommitting. But touching every page at malloc()
time won't save you from causing OOS. I'll have to use your own "swapping",
mlock() you own RAM, and handle your very own OOM conditions.

Nothing. I'm against non-overcommiting. It's just that touching every page
isn't a "safe" malloc().
