Version 3 came out in 1998 or so, and large software projects should be, 
but rarely are, rewritten from scratch every 5 years.  If you want to 
object to XFS, object that it hasn't been rewritten in recent times.
As for the notion that the more designing you do, the less rewriting you 
need to do, it is a bit like the belief that the better your scientific 
theories the less you need to perform experiments.
Projects that are no longer attempting rewrites of their cores are dead 
in their soul, and their authors should pass them on to someone younger.
That said, version 4 will be followed by semantic enhancements and 
distributed filesystem work, as I finally have in version 4 a storage 
layer good enough that I can move mostly to the tasks that first 
interested me about FS design.  Most of the stuff that needs improvement 
in the version 4 storage layer can be done as new plugins, or so I 
fondly hope.;-)
