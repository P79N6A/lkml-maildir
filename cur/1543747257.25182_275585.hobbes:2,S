Actually, it was a bit smarter (but just a small bit :) ) -- it allowed
multiple files and allocated space by dividing the whole partition to
256 blocks and remembering a single-sector FAT-like structure. However,
no subdirectories were supported.
The code is probably of historical interest only, but you can find it
at 
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/local/mj/linux/smugfs-0.0-2.0.32.tar.gz.
Once it worked, but I don't believe it's SMP safe.
				Have a nice fortnight
