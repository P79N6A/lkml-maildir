Well, that is James plan. I suppose that for hardware that can do
hardware rotation, it will be faster to do it instead of having the
software do it though, and thus it would be nice to have a driver hook
or something.
This way, if rotation is asked, then if the driver supports hardware
rotation, do it, and if not, do it in software.
At first, no driver will support hardware rotation anyway, so it would
be done in software.
And then, you reuse the same stuff to drive a chinese console or
something such.
