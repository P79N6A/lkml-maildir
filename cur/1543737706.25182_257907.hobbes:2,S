Save a process:
while [ "`ps | grep '/sbin/[h]otplug'`" ]; do sleep 1; done
Depending on what exactly you're waiting on, you might also try:
while [ ! -b /dev/hdc1 ]; do sleep 1; done
(Assuming you know what device name you're expecting - this may depend on
the exact list of things that you want to do - there *might* be a race
condition where fdisk has created hd?1 but it's not the *right* one because
the media was previously partitioned and fdisk hasn't told the kernel to
read the new one yet. YMMV and all that...)
