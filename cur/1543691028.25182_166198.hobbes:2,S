If it's gcc-3.3.2-0pre3 (the current most recent gcc in sid) then I
spent most of Saturday compiling various kernels (including a 2.4.22
that used to work). Every kernel I compiled with that particular
revision showed the ide-scsi irq timeout bug on bootup. Furthermore,
/dev/hdc was unreadable...
Dropping back to gcc-3.2 and the same kernel, same config,
same... works fine (including 2.4.23-pre4).
Now it may indeed be that the problem is a missing 'barrier()' or
something like that in the ide code, but I haven't got the time to try
to track it down...
Cheers,
  Trond
