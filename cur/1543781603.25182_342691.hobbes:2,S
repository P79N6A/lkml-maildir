Dear Lennart,
A have a new fining here.
fdisk -l -u /dev/tfa0:
debdev1:~# fdisk -l -u /dev/tfa0
Disk /dev/tfa0: 14 MB, 14680064 bytes
2 heads, 32 sectors/track, 448 cylinders, total 28672 sectors Units =
sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/ tfa0p1		57       28799       14371+   1  FAT12
On a keen look on the above fdisk output on my 16MB SD card, you can
find the cylinder information as 448 where as my driver ioctl returns
450.
I have found from the partition table that Total n/o sector for the
primary partition is 28743 (total sectors).
But my ioctl returns total cylinders as 450 i.e. 28800 sectors.
As 28743 is NOT any multiple of 64(2*32)i.e sectors*heads, the fdisk
tried manipulates it to get multiples of 64.
So, finally the best multiple 448 cylinders (i.e. 28672 sector)
So, finally that NOT a BUG in the driver instead is a generalization
made by fdisk command.
Please find the inline comments.

This is a policy & NO policy is the driver should be implemented.
I think we need NOT handle all this in the driver. The upper layer of
the mount application looks into verifying this.

There is a partition table in the CAM formatted device & it looks like
there is also a partition table in the win formatted device.
The details of there at offset 0x1BE are below.

NO, I think driver is NOT broken instead the partition tables speaks SO.
sfdisk returns 448 cylinders for my 16MB SD card, where as my driver
ioctl returns 450.
I have found from the partition table that Total n/o sector for the
primary partition is 28743 (total sectors) whereas my ioctl returns
total cylinders as 450 i.e. 28800 sectors. 
As 28743 is NOT any multiple of 64(2*32)i.e sectors*heads, the sfdisk
manipulates it to get multiples of 64. The best multiple is 448
cylinders (i.e. 28672 sector). This is where we are missing 128 sectors.
So, finally that NOT a BUG in the driver instead is a generalization
made by sfdisk command.

I added BLKGETSIZE ioctl. When I tried to note the ioctl called at mount
time I find it is all the time HDIO_GETGEO.
At this angle it clear that sfdisk output is Not the result of BUG in
the driver instead it is a result of partition table TOTAL SECTORS
entry. 
I have a doubt where Linux is treating this a separate class of device.
I heard some thing about the FS found on the Floppies. 
I guess FS on win & linux SD is such kind of FS & so I am able to mount
it.
How do I verify this? I am clean about the FS on Floppies. I will try to
find it tomorrow on the NET.
As CAM SD has altogether HD like info. And that is why we are NOT able
to mount it.
Can you comment on this?

Mukund Jampala
