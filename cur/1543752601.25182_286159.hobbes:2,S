Jesse-
I'm having trouble with enabling the legacy PCI stuff.  I added #define
HAVE_PCI_LEGACY to pci.h, but probe.c doesn't build:
drivers/pci/probe.c: In function `pci_create_legacy_files':
drivers/pci/probe.c:50: error: `pci_read_legacy_io' undeclared (first
use in this function)
drivers/pci/probe.c:50: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported
only oncedrivers/pci/probe.c:50: error: for each function it appears
in.)
drivers/pci/probe.c:51: error: `pci_write_legacy_io' undeclared (first
use in this function)
drivers/pci/probe.c:60: error: `pci_mmap_legacy_mem' undeclared (first
use in this function)
Am I missing something obvious? :)
Thanks-
John
