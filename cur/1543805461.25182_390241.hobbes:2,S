Let me come back to this again and give an important statement...
	If this mailing list is not the place where to 
	make architectural design decisions, then we really better 
	should stop this discussion immediately as it then would be useless.
	Please inform me about this fact in case you know more as I really
	don't have time to waste with useless discussions.
It seems also required to give some background information:
Without Matthias, I would already never again answered any mail from LKML
as all previous experiences on this list have been a desaster. It did usually
take less than an hour until someone from the list did start personal attacks.
The last two times, the discussion has been made impossible because Jens Axboe 
started with personal infringements and his obvious false claims.
This time, it did look really promising until Jens Axboe again started with 
personal infringements. I have to admit that it would have been better to 
ignore him from the very beginning, but I was in false hope that he could have 
changed.
Let me make a proposal: I try to answer mail from people who send useful 
contributions to the discussion and I will ignore anybody who starts with 
personal infringements. I will try to reply to mails with incorrect claims if 
they are not obvious but I will stop replying to the same person if he 
continues with things that are incorrect.
Jörg
