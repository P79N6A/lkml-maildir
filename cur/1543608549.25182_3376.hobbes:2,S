Chroot will allow you to keel a user within a certain directory tree, and as
long as you use hard links on the same FS, you won't waste much space for
each chroot...
Also, why don't you want the users to be able to see the executable
directories?  They're only writable by root, right?
If you set each user's home directory to mode 0700 no other user will be
able to cd into that dir...
The real question is why do you want to split each user so much?
