I don't think the change to vmalloc_sync_all in this patch is necessary -
the mechanism exists solely for dealing with modular users of the die
notifier in the NMI case. Since there's no NMI visible to guests, I don't
think the mechanism is necessary; it could even be completely
circumvented for paravirtual guests.
