To my recall:  Never.
Some limited subset of C++ was tried, but was soon abandoned.
Overall the kernel data structures are done in objectish-manner,
although there are no strong type mechanisms being used.
Could the kernel be written in a limited subset[*] of ObjC ?  Very likely.
Would it be worth the job ?   Radical decrease in number of available
programmers...

   memory allocation, when operating in interrupt state.
