Wouldn't it be cleaner to wrap this unlikely around
the top-level "({ })"?  When it sits on a line by
itself it looks strange, that much is true :)
Actually, the last time I saw a construct like this
it was a bug, someone was doing:
	return unlikely(someval);
which turned someval into a boolean, even though what
was intended was that the full value was returned.
