Dear Reader,
i've got some PCs with the VIA vt82c686b southbridge on board.
As i've read, it has an Bug. (Did VIA gave an useful official statement that can 
i citate to exchange those buggy boards?)
And - there is an workaround in drivers/pci/quirk.c named "quirk_vialatency".
But in table "static struct pci_fixup pci_fixups[] __initdata = {"
isn't an entry for that chipset.
I think the following line should be added:
{ PCI_FIXUP_FINAL, PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA, 
PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C686, quirk_vialatency },
then it worked (form /var/log/boot.msg):
<6>Applying VIA southbridge workaround.
But I don't have enough time, to test all systems, if the workaround 
"quirk_vialatency" really works.
Thanks in Advance,
  J. Barth
