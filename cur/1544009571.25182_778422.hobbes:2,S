Hi Adam,
Do you have any proposals for how pnpacpi_set_resources() should
handle failure?  Witold started out with code to call acpi_bus_set_power()
only if the device is power-manageable, and he then passed the
return code up.  I suggested letting acpi_bus_set_power() do
the "is-power-manageable" check.  But then the caller would have
to distinguish the "device isn't power-manageable" error from
others, which is kind of ugly.
