I agree that the real fix is to unify the stradis driver so that it
uses the existing saa7146 driver (and extending the saa7146 driver if
it doesn't have all the support necessary yet).   Keep in mind that at
the time the driver was written, there was no other saa7146-based card
on the market (mid 1999).
Until the pci change there was never a single complaint.
Unfortunately it was ill timed to happen when I was busiest at work,
and even now I'm on my way to New Zealand for a month where I'll be
out of touc as well, so the "right" fix is not likely to happen soon.
I didn't even know that other saa7146 cards had been developed until
the bug reports about the conflicts started pouring in.  I don't run
bleeding edge kernels anymore due to work having a rhel3 requirement
because the lame cad tool vendors are so far behind the curve.
