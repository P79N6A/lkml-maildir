Subject: 2048 bytes/sector media in 2.2.12

Some time back, I helped a friend install a 9 gigabyte hard drive, which
he had recently acquired.  This drive has 2k sectors (I believe it was
originally for a Macintosh, but I don't really know.)  In any case, it
resisted all efforts to turn it into a 512-byte-sector drive, forcing me
to look for solutions in the MO-drive category.  I setup a machine
running 2.1.121 and samba.
However, it exhibits odd networking behaviour, and causes the
(admittedly cheap) hub to go nuts whenever large files were transferred
over the network - the collision light on the hub would go solid and it
would eventually freeze for a second and then the hub would reset.  I
assume this is due to something in 2.1.121 as it did this with multiple
network cards - and I don't really keep up with the experimental
kernels.  However, I suppose it could be possible that I did something
wrong in the change, as I couldn't find a distribution based on the 2.1
series.
So now that 2.2 is out, he wants me to upgrade to 2.2 (I also noted that
apparently the partitioning in 2.1 counts the sectors as if they were
all 512 bytes long, leaving the values all multiplied by 4.  Is this
correct?).  However, when I went to re-partition the drive under 2.2.12, I
get the following error message:
> fdisk -b 2048 /dev/sda
ll_rw_block: device 08:00: only 2048-char blocks implemented (1024)
Unable to read /dev/sda
> fdisk -v
fdisk 2.9w
(I compiled the latest version of fdisk just in case it made a
difference.)
I looked into the sources of both fdisk, and the kernel, and the call
that is causing ll_rw_block to printk() is
fdisk.c:568:		if (sector_size != read(fd, buffers[partitions], sector_size))
fdisk.c:569:			fatal(unable_to_read);
Apparently, this read() call is being converted somewhere along the line
from a 2k read to a 1k read, if I understand it correctly.
Another oddity:  I tried changing the fdisk code to turn off the
limitation of the -b option to try a read for 4k.  Then, it never even
got that far: it couldn't get past the malloc() call right about:
fdisk.c:566:		if (!(buffers[partitions] = (char *) malloc(sector_size)))
fdisk.c:567:			fatal(out_of_memory);
This worked up to -b 2258, but anything higher wouldn't work.  I am
stumped on this, as there was 60+ M of free swap space.  I don't even
know if my problem is in the kernel or not, but I did find a mention of
this error message in the list archives, so I suspect it may be a kernel
bug.  I didn't see an explanation or a solution, though.
I really would like to be able to use this disk in 2.2 - any ideas would
be greatly appreciated.  Kernel config follows.
