Its a bug in cfbimgblt.c. In cfb_imageblit you have a test 
} else if (image->depth == bpp)
Its should be 
} else if (image->depth <= bpp)
instead. At present the logo will only show up when the framebuffer depth 
matches the image's depth. cfb_imageblit supports displaying images of 
equal or lesser depths than the framebuffer.
