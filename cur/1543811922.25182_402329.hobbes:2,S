Could you please provide a link to that 'previous BME submissions'? 
Thanks.
Also, since you are modifying LSM interfaces, why not discuss it on the 
LSM mailing list?
And finally, please don't remove nameidata. Modules out there depend on it 
and we at Sophos are about to release a new product which needs it as 
well. The plan was to announce the whole thing parallel with the release, 
but after spotting your post I was prompted to react ahead of the 
schedule. However, I am very busy at the moment so the actual announcment 
with full details will have to wait for a week or two.
