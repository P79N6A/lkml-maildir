Nope, genuinely inverted,  modprobe ledtrig-default-on and
# echo default-on > /sys/class/leds/ath5k-phy0\:\:*x/trigger
actually blanks the LED.
ledtrig-heartbeat exhibits a weird inverted but actually heartbeat-like pattern,
too.
IOW, our hardware _is_ inverted for real I believe and the driver needs
to be fixed.
Oh, and what about the second LED on the left side? That one would be
available for driver implementation, too, right?
Or is that one hard-wired (via Embedded Controller?)
to rfkill mechanical switch?
(default use for those two would then be rfkill / Rx/Tx triggers, right?)
