Our new compatible cartridges are sold as new cartridges and are produced by a manufacturer other than your printer manufacturer and like the OEM, are manufactured with new and recycled parts. Our new premium compatibles are produced under stringent quality controls and are built to meet or exceed your OEM's specifications. This means simply that our new compatibles deliver the highest quality print as well as the longest possible life and at a fraction of the cost of an OEM.
