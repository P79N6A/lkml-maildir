I am going to code something clean, modular, and in the kernel, and then
other people can look at how it works, and if they like it they can
implement some libg userspace code to emulate it if they decide they
want to port gnome to W2k without porting reiserfs to W2k.
It will take me a while, since I have to code patricia tree support to
for reiserfs directories first (we need to be able to fit 30 million
entry directories into a moderate amount of RAM to effectively support
the ecila internet search engine.).  This probably means I will hire
somebody to do the "anti-stream" code rather than do it myself, but
we'll see.
