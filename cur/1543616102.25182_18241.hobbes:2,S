No.  No.  In this case you're giving cp external linkage, which means it
can be observed from the outside.  Plus, you're reading it multiple times,
which in the case of volatile definitely means it should be read multiple
times because it might be modified by something external between those
reads, and that may be exactly what you want to observe with your code.
What I mean (and what we're seeing in RELOC) is more like this:
char *foo() {
  char * volatile cp = NULL;
  return cp;
}
