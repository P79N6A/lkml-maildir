it might also make sense to let semaphores really be a function call.  
Right now our semaphore fastpath goes like:
 770:   b9 24 00 00 00          mov    $0x24,%ecx
 7d5:   f0 ff 0d 24 00 00 00    lock decl 0x24
 77b:   0f 88 57 01 00 00       js     8d8
if down() was a function call, it would be like:
 790:   b8 24 00 00 00          mov    $0x24,%eax
 795:   e8 fc ff ff ff          call   796 <dummy2+0x6>
ie. 10 bytes icache footprint, vs. 18 bytes icache footprint in the
inlined variant (17 bytes on UP).
In a typical vmlinux there are 300 down()s, so this would save more than
2K of instructions off the hotpath. [even if only half of those down()s
are truly performance critical, it's 1K off.]
[btw., gcc load %ecx in the fastpath, which looks wrong, perhaps an
optimization bug in the inline assembly?]
and in that case we could implement semaphores by letting them take the
waitqueue spinlock even in the fastpath - it's not a scalability problem
because that cacheline must be exclusive-locked anyway for the atomic op.
and by doing that we could implement more complex things like fairness, or
writers-preferred-over-readers type of semantics much more easily - and
*many* of the subtle races would simply go away, since we'd be able to
assume a frozen semaphore state.
i suspect such a semaphore implementation would take only about 2-3 cycles
more than the current one, in the fastpath.

agreed. I used semaphores for completion purposes for quite some time and
in quite many pieces of code, and completions are just so much more
logical in naming.
