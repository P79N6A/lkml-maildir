Tricky for Joe Programmer, perhaps.
I've been personally involved with writing SIGFPE-handling code
in a major telco application framework, for several different
CPU architectures and operating systems.
SIGSEGV is used by some garbage collectors, some JITs, and I believe
also some software distributed shared memory implementations.
I've heard of at least one Lisp implementation that used SIGBUS
instead of dynamic type checks in some operations (e.g. to catch
CAR of a non-CONS).
Handled signals should not be logged.
