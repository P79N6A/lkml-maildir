I think he missed the solution rather than missing the problem - in fact
much of the problem he reports comes from missing the real solution. The
problem though is that he's trying to solve the wrong problem. We don't
need to care about the "right kernel for box xyz" we just need to care
about "boots on box xyz".
What does that mean. Well it means you can take a pre-existing modular
everything script, set the CPU to be low enough to boot on the users
box, make the root device compiled in, make the root fs compiled in (or
use initrd as Red Hat does) and its done.
