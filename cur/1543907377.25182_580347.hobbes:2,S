Seven hours before you posted this, in 
<20070807001429.f8cb3b22.akpm@linux-foundation.org>, Andrew already 
noted it was not in -mm.
A trivial examination of the broken-out mm patches backs up the absence 
  of Jens' block tree, too.
So let's put this myth / bad assumption to rest, shall we?

That factor always exists.  It's not confined to SCSI or large trees. 
It's basic the nature of the merge window.  Nothing new or shocking here.

It didn't get integration testing, at least in part, because it did not 
hit our official pre-release tree.  Quoth Andrew:

Evidence says otherwise.

I wouldn't call bsg carefully matured, if in addition to not really 
gracing -mm with its presence, the userland API structure is still 
getting changes on July 29, 2007 (0c6a89ba640d28e1dcd7fd1a217d2cfb92ae4953).
