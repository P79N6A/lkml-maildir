Well, strictly speaking it _is_ undefined, however adding/subtracting
__PAGE_OFFSET is far too common operation and one can resonably expect
to get away with it in the _vast_ majority of cases. IMHO, it is
better to fix the particular case, which triggers the undefined
behaviour, as these cases are bound to be _very_ rare.
