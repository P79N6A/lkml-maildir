Hi!
While testing linux-2.6.0-test2-mm4 I noticed two things:
- O_DIRECT doesn't work, at least in ext3, with block size different 
from filesystem's blocksize. (It doesn't work with 512 bs, at least).
This works in 2.6.0-test2, from 512 to 4096.
- vmstat doesn't show bi/bo for O_DIRECT's disk access.
Tested with filesystem's bs alignment.
This works in 2.6.0-test2.
(This one can be a feature, not a bug. But I really don't know)
Just to let you know! :)
If I can help with something feel free to ask. I tried to review -mm4 
but it's too big for me so I can't point where the "problem" is... 
Anyway, I suspect the AIO stuff ;)
Have fun,
RaTao
