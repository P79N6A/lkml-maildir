He might be able to do the same thing with `cat /dev/urandom > /dev/hda`.
There are not a lot of file-system checks against bad data in file-systems.
The '-w' reset will guarantee bad data, which may propagate to the
file-system(s) in use, causing all kinds of problems. So, the OOPS under
these conditions is expected.
