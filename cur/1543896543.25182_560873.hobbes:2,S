It sounds a little fishy to want that in the first place. If we wanted
inotify on /proc, it should work on all files I guess, but that's
an immense amount of work.
What file are you talking about in particular?
Why does it have to be in /proc?
Why not use another notification mechanism -- blocking read(), poll(),
uevent, ...?
