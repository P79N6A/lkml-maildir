Thanks Linus. I will try my best to learn from your criticism.
But please do not compare me with maintainers, especially never in this life with the suboptimal one from linuxtv.org being in question.
a. I ain't no maintainer
b. As far as my virtues are concerned in comparison to his the comparison
is completely displaced.
Above that it feels good to have people like you.
Best regards
Uwe
