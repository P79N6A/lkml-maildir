It happened to me several times already. If you have large disk and your
root partition on it and want to repartition the rest, you'd otherwise have
to reboot...

I completely agree with this. Probably some ioctl (e.g. BLKRR1PART) with
some structure describing what to do.
If I find some time for it, I'll try to code something and come with it back
to you.
