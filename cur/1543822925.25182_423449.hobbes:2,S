Hello,
I have problems with my USB keyboard after several hours of not using
it. It simply accepts no input after I come back to my machine. I use
BIOS (firmware update 1.1 for intel mac mini) emulation and kernel 2.6.15.2.
When I disconnect it, it works like charm again. Has anyone an idea or sees the
same effect? I had running 2.6.15.2 two weeks without rebooting running on my
mac mini and did not experience such problems. My only idea is that it has
something todo with the firmware upgrade for the bios comp. layer. Does
anybody sees such effects in here who has firmware update 1.1 installed? My
solution so far is to unplug my keyboard and put it in after 3 seconds. After
that it works again. The mouse is working all the time.  I use a SUN
Type 6 USB keyboard which is shipped with SunRays. I also tried to use
another SunRay keyboard which doesn't change the problem.
