Hi,
I use 2.2.13, 19991111-IDE patch, tulip-091g, CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO, no hdparm.
Using only one IDE channel, everything works.
Using one HPT366 channel and one PIIX channel works, too.
Using both HPT366 channels (i.e. cp -a from /dev/hde to /dev/hdg), I get the
following errors:
>hde: timeout waiting for DMA
>hde: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
>hde: DMA disabled
>ide2: reset: success
>hdg: timeout waiting for DMA
>hdg: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
>hdg: DMA disabled
>ide3: reset: success
>hde: irq timeout: status=0x50 { DriveReady SeekComplete }
>hde: irq timeout: status=0x50 { DriveReady SeekComplete }
When the cp has not finished after some minutes, the tulip driver begins to
report irq timeouts and finally looses its network connection (permanently
switches modes...).
Essentially, only one channel of the HPT366 is usable.
Board is Gigabyte586DX with 1x P233MMX (tried with and without APIC support,
CONFIG_PCI_OPTIMIZE, HPT366_FAST_IRQ_PREDICTION) and Abit Hotrod66 (bios
1.07, irq 11, not shared).
Anybody know hints/a solution?
