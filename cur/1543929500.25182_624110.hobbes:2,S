You seem to be confused. He's not talking about changing any userspace
interface, merely how the /dev/urandom data is generated.
For Matt's benefit, part of the original posting:

A PRNG is clearly unacceptable. But roughly restated, why not have
/dev/urandom supply merely cryptographically strong random numbers,
rather than a mix between the 'true' random of /dev/random down to the
cryptographically strong stream it'll provide when /dev/random is
tapped? In principle, this'd leave more entropy available for
applications that really need it, especially on platforms that don't
generate a lot of entropy in the first place (servers).
