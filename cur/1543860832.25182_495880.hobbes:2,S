Subject: [KBUILD] I don't want initramfs in 2.6.19.1 but usr/ is still processed

    Hi all :)
    I've noticed that, even if I say NO to initramfs (and even ramdisk
support), the make process wants to GEN usr/initramfs_data.cpio.gz by
running the scripts/gen_initramfs_list.sh script.
    Why is that script run no matter the initramfs support? Looks like
it only depends on the contents of CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE :?
    Thanks in advance :)
