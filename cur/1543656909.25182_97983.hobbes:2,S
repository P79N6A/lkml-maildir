Ouch, I hadn't thought about that one...

For a similar reason this is why my kexec stuff does not attempt to
do generic device disables.

Well we need southbridge drivers on x86 if we want to prevent SCI interrupts
because those go around the i82559.  Though we might catch them at the local
apic...
