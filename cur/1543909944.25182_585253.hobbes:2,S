Applied 1-6, thanks! BTW, your patch #2 doesn't apply cleanly on
floppy.c in current -git, and there has been no changes there since July
24th. So you must be diffing against something else?
You also don't re-indent and remove one nesting when removing
bio_for_each_segment(). It makes it easier to review, but I formatted
that as well since I had to hand-apply patch #2.
Please inspect the #block-2.6.24 branch to see the result.
