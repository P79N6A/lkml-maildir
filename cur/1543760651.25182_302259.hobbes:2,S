Thanks Andrew.  I can just do a bk clone from
http://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.6
 to get Linus's current tree, right?
The warning reported here doesn't need mount -o sync to trigger though.
A simple crash on a default mounted FS can usually cause the FS loop.
(Also, I realized I made many typos in my report --- this implies I'm
tired and should probably get some sleep :)
