And if HZ is 100, you have gone from 1 to 0 which probably
means you haven't done anything. It seems that if a process
is computable, it will always get the CPU at least for one
tick.
The original poster wants it to not get the CPU if there is
anything else that is computable. Since the scheduler looks
at each task in turn, I don't think that ever happens with
the either SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR. Maybe he can change the
policy to SCHED_OTHER and see if that works.
The granularity of -19 to +19 is not really very good for
fine process control in Unix..
