Hi Rusty,
 Might be worth mentioning in the Per-CPU data section that code doing
operations on CPU registers (MSRs and the like) needs to be protected
by an explicit preempt_disable() / preempt_enable() pair if it's doing
operations that it expects to run on a specific CPU.
For examples, see arch/i386/kernel/msr.c & cpuid.c
