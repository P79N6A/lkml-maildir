Once again the user space ranking of PIDs for OOM killer purposes didn't
propose a new selection mechanism. This misinterpretation is misleading the
discussion of whether it may have som use in embedded devices or not.
Even though, I believe that for PCs environment it has a great potential
when you think that admins don't stay all the time in front of a computer.
Once and while they also have a rest :). In these cases, instead of simply
start ranking a deamon could dispatch a msg to her/him saying the system
is approaching a red zone.
