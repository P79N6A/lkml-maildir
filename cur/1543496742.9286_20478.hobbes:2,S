Ahem. No. Sorry to reply so late, I was out of the country for a while.
As I'm working on the native interface to the kernel (no more libc), I was
reading the glibc2.1 sources and in there is written:
| /* Linux uses a negative return value to indicate syscall errors,                                 
|    unlike most Unices, which use the condition codes' carry flag.

|    Since version 2.1 the return value of a system call might be                                   
|    negative even if the call succeeded.  E.g., the `lseek' system call                            
|    might return a large offset.  Therefore we must not anymore test                               
|    for < 0, but test for a real error by making sure the value in %eax                            
|    is a real error number.  Linus said he will make sure the no syscall                           
|    returns a value in -1 .. -4095 as a valid result so we can savely                              
|    test with -4095.  */                                                                           
I found no public statement about this fact.
Groetjes, Peter
