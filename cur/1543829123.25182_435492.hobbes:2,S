I don't understand that.  We're taking an ioctl against a dm device and
we're passing it through to an underlying device?  Or something else?
Care to flesh this out a bit?

It _should_ be possible to use unlocked_ioctl() - unlocked_ioctl() would be
pretty useless if someone was passing it a NULL file*.  More details?
