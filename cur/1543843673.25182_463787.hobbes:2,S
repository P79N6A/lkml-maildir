the __trace attribute would be a _specific_ replacement for a _specific_ 
static markup at the entry of a function. So no, we would not want to 
add __trace to _every_ function in the kernel: only those which get 
commonly traced. And note that SystemTap can trace the rest too, just 
with slighly higher overhead.
In that sense __trace is not an enabling infrastructure, it's a 
performance tuning infrastructure.

yeah. __trace_entry and __trace_exit [or both] attributes. Makes sense.

yes, yes, yes, exactly!!! Finally someone reads my mails and understands 
my points. There's hope! ;)
