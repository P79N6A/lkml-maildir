OK.  Can you give us a ballpark estimate of how many send_kmessage() calls
we're likely to have in two years time?

- The GFP_ATOMIC page allocation is unfortunate.  Please pass in the
  gfp_flags, or change it to GFP_KERNEL and provide a separate
  send_kmessage_atomic()?
- Methinks the kernel won't build if the user set CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV=n
- When fixing that up, please add CONFIG_KERNEL_EVENTS or whatever,
  provide the appropriate do-nothing stubs if it's disabled.  For the tiny
  systems.
- send_kmessage() is racy against kmessage_exit().  I'm not sure that's
  worth fixing - if you agree then it would set minds at ease to simply
  remove kmessage_exit().
- This code will never work as a module, so why include the
  MODULE_AUTHOR/DESCRIPTION/etc?
- What led to the decision to export send_kmessage() to only GPL modules?
