I would wait for at least 2.4.10 on production systems (servers in
particular). Not to start a flame or anything (yeah, right), but 2.2.x was
not usable on such systems before it reached 2.2.16 IMHO.
So, I guess, the "crippling" of driver submissions could hurt me bit, in
theory, which I don't like. ;-)
