This is obviously just a taste thing. Whether to have that forget(x)
barrier as something author should explicitly sprinkle appropriately
in appropriate places in the code by himself or use a primitive that
includes it itself.
I'm not saying "taste matters aren't important" (they are), but I'm really
skeptical if most folks would find the former tasteful.

That's definitely the point, why not. This is why "barrier()", being
heavy-handed, is not the best option.

Sure, that forget(x) macro _is_ proposed to be made part of the generic
API. Doesn't explain why not to define/use primitives that has volatility
semantics in itself, though (taste matters apart).
