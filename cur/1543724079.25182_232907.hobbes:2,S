	Hi,
	Currently mousedev combines all hardware motion data that arrivers
since
	last time userspace read data into one cooked PS/2 packet. The
problem is
	that under heavy or even moderate load, when userspace can't read
data
	quickly enough, we start loosing valuable data which manifests in:
	- ignoring buton presses as by the time userspace gets to read the
data
	  button has already been released;
	- click starts in wrong place - by the time userspace got aroungd
and read
	  the packet mouse moved half way across the screen.
I am seeing the second simptom on Fedora Core 2 in X.
( I click on a windows title, move the mouse and what happens is than a 
selection rectangle is drawn on the desktop, starting a few inches away from
the real click position )
Is this the cause ?
Regards,
David
P.S.: Is there a bug about this in bugzilla.redhat.com ? ( or elsewhere ? )
