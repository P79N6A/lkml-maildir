Hi,
OK, so glibc 2.1 has Berkeley DB2.  Good.  Sendmail is delivered so
that it uses Berkeley DB2 (file confirms it).  Good.
Now, I use DB_File.pm in Perl to create a hash db and the resulting
file:
        - Is unknown to file (shows as data)
        - Is not read by db_dump nor db_dump185
What on earth is DB_File creating?  What on earth is libdb.so.3?
How do I create in Perl a database that sendmail can read in real
time?
Thanks in advance,
Julio
