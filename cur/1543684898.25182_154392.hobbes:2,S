There is a flaw in this flaw.  :-)
/tmp# mkdir a
/tmp# mkdir a/b
/tmp# mkdir a/c
/tmp# mount --bind a a/b
/tmp# ls a  
b  c
/tmp# ls a/b
b  c
/tmp# ls a/b/b/
/tmp#
It is enlightening in this regard to consider the difference between
using unix /etc/fstab and Hurd translators to manage your namespace.
In preparing this example, I discovered that find and ls -R already
have hard-link cycle "protection" built in, so they are broken in
the presence of bind mounts.  :-(
