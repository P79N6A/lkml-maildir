It's incorrect.
The init section will be free'd, and as a result can be re-allocated to 
other uses. Thus testing that data is not in the init-section makes no 
sense.
Testing for _code_ not being in the init section can be sensible, since 
code never gets re-allocated (modulo module code, but that's never in the 
init section). So checking the "notifier_call" part may be sensible, but 
checking the notifier block data pointer definitely is not.
Patches 1-2 applied.
