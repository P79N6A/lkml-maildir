Mike,
I agree with the F_GETLK part, as I pointed out to Trond earlier. However,
I feel it is odd to block a client for about one minutre when it issues
"non-blocking" lock requests. I have seen that Solaris code does so but
still feels odd and it may conflict with what most programmers expect,
though I see your point, perhaps if this was well documented in man pages
there would not be a problem. In Linux this is not the case.
Juan

F_GETLK indicates a conflict by changing the arg struct to show the
conflicting lock.
As for the original topic, I would hesitate before changing the client
locking code to return EAGAIN just because the server is in its grace
period.  The "blocking" or "non-blocking" behavior is tied to what
happens when there is already a lock that conflicts with the requested
one.  When the server is in the grace period, it's unknown as to
whether there is already a lock that conflicts with the requested
one.
