I think I get what you're trying to say, but I also think you're either
overstating your case ("...totally different and share nothing but the
name...") or underestimating the similiarity - they both need (albeit
for different reasons) to do the cpu hotplugging, driver suspending
(yeah, there are similarities and differences there) and irq disabling.
That's _some_ similarity. Apart from that, yeah - they are totally
different.
Re the name, we discussed changing the name of Suspend2 on IRC a night
or two ago. We came to the conclusion that, for better or for worse,
it's too well known now. I can see your logic in wanting to
differentiate them, but I seem to be a bit stuck :\. Push some more.
Maybe we'll get there anyway :) Maybe you can get rid of that horrible,
unpronounceable 'swsusp' name while you're at it? :)

Does that imply that you'd prefer to see filesystem checkpointing code,
that you think freezing can be done better, or do you have some other
solution that hasn't occurred to me?

Fair enough :).
