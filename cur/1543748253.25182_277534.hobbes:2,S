Unfortunately I need netfilter (for now, I haven't had time to look into
replacing the rules with tc yet).

On a scale of one to ten, one being "will crash on the first packet",

under high load" and ten being "rock stable" how would the patch be rated?
The announcement doesn't look too promising:

Also when looking at the profiles, fib_* isn't showing up at (not even
near) the top. Testworthy none the less?
