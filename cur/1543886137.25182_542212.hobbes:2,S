Hello Ingo.
Sorry it has taken this long, but i've been quite busy with work.
Here are my results with v11 for smoothness.
under slight load (spamasassin nice 19'ed), its now doing okay in
smoothness, almost as good as SD. but under harder load such as pressing
a link in a browser while 3d(at nice 0), or spamasassin at nice 0 still
makes it go stutterish instead of smooth. But overall it does seem
better.
