Well, I'm not making any kind of legal statement.  I'm just pointing out 
that from a technical perspective, there's a large visible functional 
change from before if we use EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(paravirt_ops) vs 
EXPORT_SYMBOL(paravirt_ops).  Given that the whole point of paravirt_ops 
is to minimize visible changes, this seems counterproductive.
