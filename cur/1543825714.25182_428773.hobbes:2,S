I did a lot of this at one time, and used lilo in just the way 
described. I did have a remote reboot device, however, an operator (1st 
shift), janitor (2nd shift), or security guard (3rd/wkend shift) who had 
been instructed to push the clearly marked reset button on demand "when 
the weird guy in New York tells you."
IBM rack units, like x345 and such, can have an "RSA" card which allows 
remote hardware monitor and reboot with a separate IP address for 
control. Worth its weight in gold! The latest will let you do remote 
console as well.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
