Thanks Linus, I was in 'quick! fix bug!' mode and got a little careless.
Such is the excitement of dev kernels, I suppose. Well, here's a pile of 
the latest fixes:
	* all 'base/index must be 32 bit' errors should be fixed (prefix
	bytes now eat us alive for code space, yay!) -- but I have no way
	of testing it for sure...
	* s/outw/outb in kill_motor
	* fixed simple bzImage loader (was only tested with lilo/syslinux,
	never as 'cat bzImage > /dev/fd0'
	* shortened "Loading" msg to just "Linux" -- quick hack to save
	a few precious bytes :)
	* a few misc. optimizations for code size
Patch attached. Tested with zImage, bzImage: both cat'd to disk, and
also with lilo.
Anyone wanting 2.3.21 to compile should apply this; it supercedes the
other quick patches I threw together earlier tonight.
Let me know if anything breaks or isn't fixed.
