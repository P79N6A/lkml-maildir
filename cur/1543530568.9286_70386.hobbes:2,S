i would dispute this.  tulip driver wrt 21041 has been broken since
may 1999 with the link beat and 21043 message.

no response, no followup, no fix.
i reported the same problem back in early january 2000 with the same
lack of response.

[btw does anyone have a 21041 based tulip working with a driver since
0.91e?]
i am not expecting a fix for every problem but some indication that
bug reports are not just entering a black hole would be nice.  i
didn't see much activity on the mailing lists myself back when i was
looking at them in january and february.
i check <URL:
http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/tulip.html>
 and
the links to greg siekas' information are dead.  alas, they have been
dead for several months now.
i have gotten the distinct impression that the linux-tulip website and
mailing lists linux-tulip and linux-tulip-bug are pretty much dead.
this is not a flame, i am just letting you know how it looks from the
outside.  please correct me if i am wrong.
