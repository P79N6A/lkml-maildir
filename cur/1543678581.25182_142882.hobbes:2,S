Yes but a word processor is not worth $300.  I am all for anyone making
a profit, but not when they hold the rest of us over a barrel and
railroad us with proprietary products that are vastly overpriced and
marginally better.  (and yes I put my money where my mouth is I actually
buy the distros and software I use and donate to GNU)
