No it does not. Did you ever look at the code? 
Also the zero copy could be put into sendfile(), or into the TCP
stack using kiovecs directly from mmaped' data in user space to device 
driver (for the benchmark situation of having only a small set of 
static data - about the only situation khttpd is useful for - it is
no problem to pre mmap all the data)
Neither sendfile nor khttpd support zero copy currently, and implementing 
it in khttpd would be about the same work as implementing an async sendfile
and doing it more generically.
