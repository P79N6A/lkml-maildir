Subject: 2.6.0-test2: Lost USB mouse after resuming from S3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/8/6/173

Causes are that usb-host controller does no handle S3 yet _plus_ possibly (depending on your hardware) 
loss of PCI interrupt links as current ACPI does not resume those.
Regards
Michael
