Understood. But all patches are not created equal. Kerneli.org v2.2/ is 
looked at as the official international tree, just as kernel.org is the official
non-international tree. Some arbitrary experimental patch somewhere I would
agree. You pays your money and you takes your choice.
And yes, I've got a copy of your how to sitting in my home directory. I
really, really did intend to read it last week... Or perhaps it was the
week before last...  But realistically speaking, the Encryption-HowTo is 
not the first place I would go hunting for the answer to a kernel compilation 
problem. I'd go there if I had trouble using the stuff.

Well, if you put it that way, perhaps I'll take a look. yeah, go ahead,
twist my arm! The way things are going I'll be busy in this area anyway over 
the next 6 months or so. I presume then I can call on you for advice if I 
do some digging? ;-)
