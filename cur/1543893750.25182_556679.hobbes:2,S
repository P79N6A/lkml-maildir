Ok, that makes sense.

i.e. don't discard anything at build time, and link the .exit.{text,
data} sections
into the kernel image for _all_ archs? (otherwise how do we avoid
special-casing/
checking for the arch in modpost and warn/not-warn about invalid/valid cases)
But then why not simply lose the __exit (and .exit.*) altogether? Because
__exit becomes redundant in the suggested changed semantics -- just mark
all the cleanup code as __init too (when it's built-in, the only
callsite for the
cleanup code would be from the startup code in .init.*, and when modular,
__init and __exit lose all relevance anyway).
