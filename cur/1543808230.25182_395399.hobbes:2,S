powerpc/ppc64, for instance, determines the number of possible cpus
from information exported by firmware (and I'm mystified as to why
other platforms don't do this).  So it's typical to have a kernel an a
pSeries partition with NR_CPUS=128, but cpu_possible_map = 0xff.

Yes, that comment is wrong or outdated.
