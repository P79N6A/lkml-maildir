I'm not sure I did this correctly, but here's what I got:
hermitage$ strace eject O_NONBLOCK                                            ~
execve("/usr/bin/eject", ["eject", "O_NONBLOCK"], [/* 32 vars */]) = 0

open("/etc/ld.so.preload", O_RDONLY)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
fstat(3, {st_mode=0, st_size=0, ...})   = 0
mmap(0, 15456, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x4000b000
close(3)                                = 0
open("/lib/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)        = 3
mmap(0, 4096, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x4000f000
munmap(0x4000f000, 4096)                = 0
mmap(0, 670580, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x4000f000
mprotect(0x400a0000, 76660, PROT_NONE)  = 0
mmap(0x400a0000, 28672, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED, 3, 0x90000) = 0x400a0000
mmap(0x400a7000, 47988, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x400a7000
close(3)                                = 0
personality(PER_LINUX)                  = 0
getpid()                                = 2282
readlink("O_NONBLOCK", 0xbffff438, 1024) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("O_NONBLOCK", O_RDONLY)            = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
write(2, "eject: open failed for `O_NONBLO"..., 63eject: open failed for `O_NONBLOCK': No such file or directory
) = 63
_exit(1)                                = ?
and it doesn't open the drive.

any kind of access.  cdctrl, ascd.  like I said, it used to work fine
with 2.0.35 :)
help, anyone?
Thanks,
