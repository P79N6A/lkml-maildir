So what? We already have tools which are needed for just one thing.
This one is at least for configuring more than one program.
Of course, the kernel (kbuild or running the kernel) requires many
things, isn't it the UNIX philosophy?
Remember ksymoops? _That_ was a single purpose.

Why only them? Why not the compiler toolchain (encoded with sharutils)
and some shell so you can bootstrap it over serial console? :-)

Such users use distribution kernels. Distributions have package
dependencies which can install anything needed automatically.
How many times have you seen people complaining that the kernel is
broken as one "can't compile it" (due to missing binutils or even gcc)?

People sending patches, of course, and the maintainer doing kernel work
as well. What ensures that, say, udev stays in sync? And udev is new
and changing.

Sure, I don't know why I mentioned .config.old, they all use it the same.
Writing at 3 am, possibly.

That's what is currently done, but it doesn't seem so smart from
maintenance POV. And UNIX philosophy, you know.
