hi
Routes relate to ethX were deleted from kernel after i shutdown ethX
(ifconfig ethX down),but after i start ethX (ifconfig ethX
XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX up ),  deleted  routes were not re-add to kernel .
Is there any patch or daemon can do this  for me, after i restart
ethX,deleted rotues were re-added to kernel automatically.
regards
