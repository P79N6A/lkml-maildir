You have confirmed that allowing the local APIC to be enabled
causes it to lock up at system management events, and that keeping
the local APIC disabled prevents those lockups?
Send me the DMI scan output (change the dmi_printk #define in dmi_scan.c
to actually do a printk) and I'll add the C810 to the blacklist.
