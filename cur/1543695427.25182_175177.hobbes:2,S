I think that generally you can view all the current generation of hardware as 
arbitary programmable devices, and most of the graphics drivers are doing 
code-generation for that hardware on the fly.  This isn't exactly new ground 
for graphics drivers as graphics hardware has alternated (I'm told) between 
fixed function and programmable cores multiple times now.
In addition, graphics drivers have been doing on-the-fly codegen for the host 
cpu since year dot.  The orignal software-rasterization SGI opengl drivers for 
windows were supposed to be pretty much state of the art in this respect.
Now that the barriers for codegen have lowered so dramatically (see, eg. 
http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/tcc/
), it is now feasible to talk of building a 
code-generating software rasterizer for mesa.
