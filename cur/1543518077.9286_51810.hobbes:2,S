sure the BUG() means the code has to be fixed to call enable_bh() without
IRQs held. This means we can unconditionally call run_bottom_halves() in
enable_bh().

my idea was to change semantics. The issue is subtle: otherwise we'd have
to put a check into __sti() and __restore_flags() to run
run_bottom_halves() - which clearly is too much overhead. enable_bh()
is/should only be used by system call context anyway, so it should not be
a problem to call enable_bh() with irqs enabled. [maybe an additional
enable_bh_sti() call could be added, to 'merge' the two sti's]
