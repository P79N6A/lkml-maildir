I have seen many broken BIOS in my time. I wouldn't say its always the
safest. Also the BIOS might not set the cards at the best possible values.
Programming the cards registers is indepedent of the platform the card is
on. A good example of this is the Virge card. Their are versions that run 
on the zorro bus as well as the PCI bus. Now you can ask the PCI bus what
specific virge card you have. The zorro bus can most likely also do the
same thing. Don't know. Now the Virge card has a special register that can
tell you what virge card model you have. I would this method since I don't
have to do a #ifdef CONFIG_PCI and #ifdef CONFIG_ZORRO. This make the
driver more portable.

The docs from the video card company should tell you how.

No. Into the fbdev driver. Fbdev abstracts mode setting for userland so
userland doesn't have to do this. Its the drivers job to make sure it sets
the mode right. Yes progarmming a fbdev driver can fry a video card. You
just have to be cardful and accept the risk. I have some very early code
in fbmon.c to handle monitors so you can't fry them. I haven't had time
yet to work on it but thats the goal.
