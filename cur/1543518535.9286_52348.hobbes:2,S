Ahhhh! Way are hardware companies so brain dead? Intels are not the only   
computers in the world. What do we do? Have the kernel have a built in x86
emulator to setup brain dead hardware. I don't want to do that. What
really needs to done is to ask these companies to release the info to set
a mode without resorting to the BIOS.

Where is this code?
