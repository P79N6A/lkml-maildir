Does anyone have any experience with the people at iogear?
Also what is the best way to contact vendors and ask them for specks on
a product?
I have a USB 2 serial converter (guc232a) and I think I need some
specific code to make it work.  So I am planning on writing a driver for
this unless someone already is.
Thanks,
Joe (not on the list)
