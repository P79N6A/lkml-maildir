These drivers are for older cards and are not fully ported to kernel 2.6. 
I never really intended to put this old stuff into kernel 2.6.
The code of io.* and di.* is common code for all supported platforms, so I
always try to reduce changes here.
Like my last patch, I will try to remove unused code in linux with a
preparser in my code-controller. So eventually the mentioned code is really
unsused and can be removed. 
I will check all this in the next days and prepare a new patch.
