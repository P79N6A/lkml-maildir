OK - that sounds reasonable.

Think of CFI-compliant flash mapped into the host's address space. Why cache 
it in RAM when you can just point a page table at the original?

So what they say on their web site about XIP is all crap? Of course, I suppose 
that shouldn't surprise me :)
Is it possible to run Linux on FFS2 without some kind on UMSDOS-like 
translation layer? Are we going to want to write our own version which is 
POSIX-compliant?

Yes please - that'd be useful.

No, it maps into the host's memory map between 0xD0000 and 0xE0000 and has a 
custom ASIC to interface to the flash. The old versions behaved very similarly 
to EMS, paging in different blocks of flash - but the new version is very 
different, and very strange. 
It's CompactFlash that uses an ATA interface, either PCMCIA-ATA or raw IDE. So
you don't even need PCMCIA support to use it, I believe.
