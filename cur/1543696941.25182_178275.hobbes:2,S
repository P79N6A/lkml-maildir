That's correct. It seems I have misunderstood your previous email.
This scheme aims for less workload on the maintainers (compared to
different test + stable trees, as with many popular projects) -
the added bit of complexity at least seems to scale well.
Users already have to live with 2.5.1 being a little older than 2.4.22.
testing/* patches are IMHO not for people who may have problems (bigger
than just a moment of confusion) with such things - they will have much
more problems reporting a bug should they found one.
I know this isn't an ideal solution, that's the best I'm currently aware
of: we'd gain much shorter devel cycle at a really small cost.
I agree entirely with Alan and his opinion expressed in this thread.
