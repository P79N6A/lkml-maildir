But that would be ugly as hell:
so apache 2.0 would become slower with MSG_NOCOPY, whereas samba 2.2
would become faster.
Is is possible to move the responsibility for maitaining the copy to the

e.g. use msg_control, and then the caller can request either that a
signal is sent when that data is transfered, or that a variable is set
to 0.
