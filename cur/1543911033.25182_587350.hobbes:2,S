One wonders why x86_64-mm-unwinder.patch has an open-coded call to
__builtin_labs(), when include/linux/kernel.h:abs() should do a fine job.
And what's this stuff, anyway?
+typedef unsigned long uleb128_t;
+typedef   signed long sleb128_t;
+#define sleb128abs __builtin_labs
unsigned and signed little-endian 128-bit types?  Nope, they're 32-bit or
64-bit.   All very mysterious.
