Whoops, thanks, I found the bug. My fault...
That "break;" breaks some (apparently broken) programs that don't expect
read of /dev/urandom to return early. For security resons (to get
identical behaviour compared to the original kernel) I made a fix that
someone proposed. That fix is apparently broken on some rare situations
which seem to be difficult to trigger (requires high overall irq rates
with network load). Now I'm going to remove that part completely and see
what happens next...
