I am doing the following:
   malloc some memory is user space
   pass its pointer to some kernel module
   in the kernel module...do a pci_alloc_consistent so that i get a memory
   region for PCI DMA operations
now the problem is that i want to remap the address range pointed by the
user space pointer to the memory region allocated by the
'pci_alloc_consistent' inside the module. I think this is possible..need
some hints....
thanks,
