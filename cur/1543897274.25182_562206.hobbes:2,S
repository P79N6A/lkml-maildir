Nothing to do with O_NONBLOCK:
$ strace -f -e trace=file firefox 2>&1 | grep dev/snd
[pid  1889] ....
[pid  1889] open("/dev/snd/pcmC0D0p", O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK) = 38
[pid  1889] open("/dev/snd/controlC0", O_RDONLY) = 37
[pid  1889] open("/dev/snd/timer", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK) = 37
$ strace -f -e trace=file ogg123 foo.ogg 2>&1 | grep dev/snd
[pid  1916] ...
[pid  1916] open("/dev/snd/pcmC0D0p", O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK|O_APPEND) = 5
[pid  1916] open("/dev/snd/controlC0", O_RDONLY) = 4
[pid  1916] open("/dev/snd/timer", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK) = 4
And both the youtube video (flash 9) and my ogg file play fine. Now, I don't 
actually know about that O_ASYNC thing you have in there but it looks as 
though you're simply not using dmix. Which card, and if you specify an ALSA 
device somewhere, is it the "default" device?
And fix your inbound mailer -- it's rejecting my posts.
Rene.
