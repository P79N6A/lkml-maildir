I've heard of problems with STL2 before, due to a poor ACPI BIOS.
If you're willing, I'd be great if you could get the ACPI pmtools
(
http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm
), run
acpidmp, and send me the output. At least then I can put the STL2 on the
ACPI blacklist, and maybe we can figure out more about the problem, too.
