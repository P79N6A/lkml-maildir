Ok, the FAN package contains 5 items, but the enumerator only
advertises the first 3. I guess that the other 2 (chipset fan and
chassis2 fan) are not usable? Are the connectors for those two fans on
your motherboard? Do you get any reading from them?
Plus: your ACPI code uses the full "magic number" (first item in the
package) to demux the reading, while my board masks the upper 2 bytes;
I need to change the driver. Will send another iteration.
