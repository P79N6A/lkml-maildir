Markus, I do think the userspace library is THE real problem with the whole 
V4L subsystem. It's annoying to keep repeating why these convertions should 
be done outside the kernel, be them in a library or not. I deliberatly never 
implemented the above convertion in the drivers that I have been maintaing 
for years, since I had the idea that this approach whould have pushed the 
developers to write the _best_ algorithm by themselves. I still think it's 
the correct approach, but now I give up. Mauro, if you are planning to accept 
this BayerToSomething color convertion, be also prepared to accept the same 
convertion for other drivers in the kernel. Rules are made for everyone.
Best regards,
Luca
