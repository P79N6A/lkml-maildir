I've seen something similar [1] happen to a LAN with one Windows XP machine
running vcool: 
http://vcool.occludo.net/
 . This is also available for Linux
(
http://vcool.occludo.net/VC_Linux.html
). Are you running this patch or a
similar one?
[1] all machines were seeing frame errors on packets > 250 bytes; it was a
10 mbit coax lan.
