After Jose debugged the problem down to the routine jfs_get_parent, we
were able to find the problem.  I believe it only affects users of
NFS-exported JFS file systems on big-endian hardware.
The problem was a missing le32_to_cpu macro.  The patch also fixes a
return code to be more consistent other implementations of get_parent.
Linus, Andrew,
We're likely to see the problem on ppc running NFS.  Does this patch
meet the criteria for 2.6.0?
