Ok, makes sense, it wasn't just a 1-liner quick fix then ;)
Still, from my experience, _very few_ people actually test things in
trees like ieee1394, fbdev, etc...  Even my tree isn't what it used
to be for pmacs now that I'm fully in sync upstream.
Even -mm lately haven't been as tested as it used to be (possibly
because of upstream getting better). I find it's quite ok to send
a fix that needs a bit more testing to a Linus -rc1 (but not later),
Ben.
