That's exactly what I was thinking.
Obviously, if [any] computer system crashes, bad things can happen.
That was not my point of confusion; rather, I was bewildered because
the author seemed to be implying that these kinds of problems could
occur *even during normal filesystem operation*.  I couldn't figure
out how that could be, unless it was due to some kind of bug in the
caching code, not a flaw in the design of the filesystem.

I'm inclined to agree, especially since elsewhere he refers to ext2 as
"the fast and unsafe grandchild" of FFS.
