aha. I'm only working with 2.6.16.16.
anyway. As I just started with the pkt-writing module, I noticed
another strange behaviour (at least, it seems strange to me, but YMMV),
and I wonder if this is has already been fixed in some -git or -mm
prepatch or snapshot or subsubsub-release-canditate ...
<linux/Documentation/cdrom/packet-writing.txt> says:
- Setup your writer
        # pktsetup dev_name /dev/hdc
Therefore, I do "pktsetup node0 /dev/hdc", which gives:
# pktsetup node0 /dev/hdc
ctl open: Not a directory
strace shows that pktsetup is trying to open /dev/pktcdvd/control,
which it cannot, since /dev/pktcdvd is a char device obviously
created upon "modprobe pktcdvd". The char device has major 10 minor
63, which seems to be missing in devices.txt.
Once I remove the char-device, pktsetup will work and create
/dev/pktcdvd/control and /dev/pktcdvd/node0. Now I try to figure
out how the rest of "packet-writing.txt" works ...
kind regards,
h.rosmanith
