Feel free to change /proc/kcore so it includes loaded modules.  While
there, include information about the modules in the appropriate format,
and GDB will automatically load the module symbols.  (Basically, make it
look like the core file refers to shared libraries).
More effort perhaps, but it would be much better technique IMHO :-)
