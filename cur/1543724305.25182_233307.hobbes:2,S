Average wall speed of RT task wakeup isn't really an issue - the issue
is deterministic worst-case latency.  Adding a hundred cycles every time
won't cause someone to miss a deadline.  The deadlines need to be based
on the worst case, where the cache is 100% cold and you're at the
beginning of a long-held mutex section etc.
An unlikely branch won't have any measurable effect on worst-case wakeup
latency, but will reduce the average impact of the test on the common
fast path for normal processes.
I don't see how this is anything but a good idea.
