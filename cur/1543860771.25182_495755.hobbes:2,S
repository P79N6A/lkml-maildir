> The 32bit and 64bit PARISC Linux kernels suffers from the problem, that the gettimeofday() call sometimes returns non-monotonic times.
This certainly needs to be fixed.  I see stuff like this from ping:
64 bytes from 132.246.100.193: icmp_seq=19 ttl=255 time=0.4 ms
64 bytes from 132.246.100.193: icmp_seq=20 ttl=255 time=429496729.5 ms
tar also occasionally prints warning about times.  This is with a
32bit kernel.
