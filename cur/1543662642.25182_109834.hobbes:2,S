Subject: how to interactively break gdb debugging kernel over serial?

I'm debugging the kernel with gdb over a serial port.  Breakpoints and
stepping through code works great, except for the fact that once the
kernel is running, I can't seem to use Control-C to stop it.  Is there
a keypress or other interactive way to break a running kernel?
Thanks,
Dave
