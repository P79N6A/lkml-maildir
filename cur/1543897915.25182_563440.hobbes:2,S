The interesting point is that what you call "internal implementation 
details" is much _more_ exposed with the OSS emulation in the kernel
_enabled_.
Why?
Linux software not supporting ALSA has becoming quite esoteric.
But software like mplayer supporting both and trying OSS first and 
software supporting both and letting the user choose is today much more 
common. And that's exactly the case where users run into the results of 
the "internal implementation detail" that their application used the 
in-kernel OSS emulation instead of ALSA resulting in exactly these 
problems.
There is also a userspace OSS emulation for ALSA not suffering from 
these problems.
It's not my decision whether or not to remove the in-kernel OSS emulation, 
all I'm saying is that removing it might actually result in less users 
having problems.
