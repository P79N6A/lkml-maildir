here's the skinny: 99% of the external module developers won't notice
until they're gone, even with the warning. And that's an optimistic
estimate. Warnings don't work for this.
All this kind of thing buys us is an excuse so that we can say "but we
warned  you for 3 months". It doesn't actually change anything else.
Maybe I'm too pessimistic in my assumption that external open module
writers don't actually follow mainline closely; and maybe part of me
would love for them to follow it closer, so close that they would even
consider submitting their driver for it. But sadly from experience...
warnings dont' work. Only when things break hard people notice.
