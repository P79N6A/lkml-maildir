Hi all,
I've been working on lguest64 and in order to do this, I had to move
a lot of the i386 specific out of the way.  Well, the lguest64 port
is still not ready to display, but before Rusty makes too many changes
I would like this in upstream so I don't have to keep repeating my
changes :-)
So this patch series moves lguest32 out of the way for other archs.
