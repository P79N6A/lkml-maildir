When attachments are allowed, I can resend them on the list as well (or 
just ask me...)
To answer a private mail: I do not use any kernel-module thats not part 
of the official kernel!
And of course nothing proprietary
# cat /proc/sys/kernel/tainted
0
I used gcc-4.1.2 (glibc-2.5-r4) to build the kernels. (Its a amd64 
system, quite stable so far.)
Programs that "disappeared" are most graphical, because others I have 
not noticed so far... also [1] might be caused by this...
amarok, kdesktop, whole X, konqueror, konsole but also gtk-apps
