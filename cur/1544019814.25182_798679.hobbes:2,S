In our embedded application it's more convenient to build all the
drivers needed to support various hardware configurations into the
kernel, and avoid messing with modules. This works fine for devices
that can be detected dynamically, but RTC chips are among the few that
need to be configured statically; my change just relaxes the current
assumption that all x86 boards have a usable CMOS RTC.
