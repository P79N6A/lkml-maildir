with old procfs one would like to set the owner field of the 
corresponding struct proc_dir_entry and/or file_operations at this point.

given owner=THIS_MODULE was set, this would bump the module's use count

Admittedly I haven't looked deeper into sysfs yet, but I was under the
assumption/hope there would be a similar approach to make module 
refcounting working there?
