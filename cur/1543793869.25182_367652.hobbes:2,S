from blk_complete_request() [ the only user of rq_all_done() ]:
+ /*
+ * for partial completions, fall back to normal end io handling.
+ */
+ if (unlikely(!partial_ok && !rq_all_done(req, nbytes)))
+         if (end_that_request_chunk(req, uptodate, nbytes))
+                 return 1;
We still will end up with using ide_softirq_done() for !rq_all_done()
case (non FS/PC request) because majority of them (all?) don't use
partial completions.
