Exactly.  All the IBM people on this list and not one remotely useful
post.  I can contact marketing@ibm.com or something if I want a bunch of
fluff.  That whitepaper is just a user level guide for the Windows

Obviously it's a motion detector on the motherboard.  How do we freaking
TALK to it?  As in, what bits to we write to what registers to do what.
Anyway, Linux support doesn't look good, if IBM isn't going to help.
