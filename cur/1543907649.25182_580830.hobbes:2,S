Yes, I tried that. No effect.

I have tried to recover from the "IRR set" situation in several ways by
changing setup_IO_APIC_irq(). But I haven't found a way to recover from
this situation once disable_IO_APIC() had been called.
I concluded thatthe sequence of events
"send INT message - never receive EOI - disable IO-APIC pin"
messes up the IO-APIC (at least this specific one in the
PCIEx-PCI bridge of the ICH7).
The current state of affairs is that the only thing that "worked" was to
re-enable irqs.

That's certainly correct. I am grateful for all hints that simplify my patch.
Thanks,
