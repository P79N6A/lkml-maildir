This topic has been on my mind to implment over a long time.
So I took a stamp on it and it hit -linus this night.
Dependencies on arch/$(ARCH)/kernel/asm-offsets.s is now tracked
like any other dependency - so we now at last have full dependency
checks for asm-offsets.h.
Take a look at the Kbuild file in the top-level directory.
With respect to the patch posted below I recall I had to zap
two $(objtree) to fix alpha build.
Patch by Jan Dittmer - see 946dc121d7d1c606f6bbeb8ae778963a1e2ff59c
But that may have changed now after introducing generic asm-offsets.h
support.
