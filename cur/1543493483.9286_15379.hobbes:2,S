Well, it turned out to be power management, but not from the BIOS... :)
The power cable for the drive was split to go to the case fan and then
the
drive.  The connector on THAT side was wiggly loose (as I discovered
when I
poked at it with my finger and listened to the drive spin down everytime
I
hit the connector).  Moving that power connector to something a bit less
necessary has returned the drive to normal function.
Thanks for the reply, and sorry for the false alarm...
