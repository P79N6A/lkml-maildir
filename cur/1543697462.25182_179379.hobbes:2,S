Broken with 
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/binutils/2003-04/msg00412.html
and

That '/' is being treated as a start of line comment char, thus trimming
the rest of the line.
I think gas/app.c:do_scrub_chars is such an awful mess that it's
impossible to get right.  Needs to be tossed out and rewritten.  The
fundamental problem is that you can't track which component of an
assember input line you're preprocessing without more information on the
particular target syntax.  And most of the current complexity is just
for deciding whether to remove whitespace!  That at least needs to go.
For now, I'm reverting HJ's patches and including your testcase in
the gas testsuite.
