this page_count check done with only the tree_lock won't prevent a
task to start O_DIRECT after page_count has been read in the above line.
If a thread starts O_DIRECT on the page, and the o_direct is still in
flight by the time you copy the page to the new page, the read will
not be represented fully in the newpage leading to userland data
corruption.

Yes, you migrate old VM pages to new VM pages. We replace VM pages
with unknown stuff called KSM pages. So in the inner function where you
replace the pte-migration-placeholder with a pte pointing to the
newpage, you also rightfully do unconditional stuff we can't be doing
like page_add_*_rmap. It's VM pages you're dealing with. Not for us.

Yes we'd need to change those bits to be able to use migrate.c.

Yes, pages owned, allocated and worked on by the VM. So they can be
swapped, collected, migrated etc... You can't possibly migrate a
device driver page for example and infact those device driver pages
can't be migrated either.
The KSM page initially is a driver page, later we'd like to teach the
VM how to swap it by introducing rmap methods and adding it to the
LRU. As long as it's only anonymous memory that we're sharing/cloning,
we won't have to patch pagecache radix tree and other stuff. BTW, if
we ever decice to clone pagecache we could generate immense metadata
ram overhead in the radix tree with just a single page of data. All
issues that don't exist for anon ram.
