What exactly are you referring to?

No objection from me.

Some facts:
* In order to be able to do suspend (STR) without the freezer, we need to make
  device drivers block access to devices from applications during suspend.
* There's no reason to think that we can't use this same mechanism for
  hibernation (the only difficulty seems to be the handling of devices used for
  saving the image).
* We need the drivers to quiesce devices to be able to do the kexec jump in the
  first place (and to avoid races, we'll need them to block applications'
  access to devices just like for STR, which is the sufficient condition for
  removing the freezer).
So, I don't really think that the "freezer removal" argument is valid here.
Moreover, if this had been the _only_ argument for the $subject functionality,
I'd have been against it.
Thanks,
