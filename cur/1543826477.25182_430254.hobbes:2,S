Life is never that simple. The total emissions of UWB are pretty low but
their spread across the wide frequency range makes them incredibly low
on any frequency - so very unlikely to interfere.
The total emissions across the set of frequencies as a sum (with
emphasis on some frequency ranges such as 2.4-2.5GHz) apparently matters
much more than the emissions at one frequency for things like human
exposure.
