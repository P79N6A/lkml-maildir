He only owns a small amount of the code. Furthermore he imported third
party GPL code using the license as sole permission. So he may have dug a
personal hole but many of the rest of us have been repeatedly saying
whenever he said that - that we do not agree. The FSF has always said
binary modules are wrong and there is FSF code imported into the kernel
by Linus on license only grounds.
Whether it is a good idea is a different question.
Alan.
