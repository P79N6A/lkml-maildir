You can't.  The patches in -mm spend 90% of their time in an untested,
often-doesn't-compile state.  It's only in the 24-48 hours preceding a
release that I actually start build- and run-time testing it all.

Well I suppose I could upload stuff to
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/mm/
 daily.  Then it's
trivial to install mm-of-the-day as a quilt series.
