Hi David,
my apologies for the spurious messages.  I'd thought, but did not type,
the warning that the messages after the annotated errors had not been
inspected yet.  They were just included for the curious.  It looks like
the networking code is more exhuberant with pointers and such, so you
got a much higher number of false positives than the other code we've
looked at.

It's just a checker mis-feature: it does not propogate assignments, so 
misses the fact that this:
        if ((dmi = dmi1) == NULL) {
                write_unlock_bh(&dev_mc_lock);
                return -ENOMEM;
        }
checks dmi1 against null.  It's not hard to add, but isn't in there.

It'd be a good option to have, but it's not quite so simple.  Two 
exceptions:
	1. You probably don't want to do this if you stored the pointer
	in memory only pointed to by a local pointer, since this root
	will be lost when you return.  
	2. In many places, even though you do store the pointer in
	persistent memory, the retry code does not check if this
	pointer is non-nil and allocates over it again.
Another possibe addition is to not flag cases where the allocated
storage was passed to another function.

This sounds like a nice check --- thanks!

Unfortunately, the error message stripped off the field names it was worried
about.  It's warning that 'p->perfect' and 'p->h' could be lost
        }
        if (!p->perfect && !p->h) {
                p->alloc_hash = p->hash;
                DPRINTK("hash %d mask %d\n",p->hash,p->mask);
                if (p->hash > p->mask) {
                        p->perfect = kmalloc(p->hash*
                            sizeof(struct tcindex_filter_result),GFP_KERNEL);
                        if (!p->perfect)
                                return -ENOMEM;
                        memset(p->perfect, 0,
                               p->hash * sizeof(struct tcindex_filter_result));
                } else {
                        p->h = kmalloc(p->hash*sizeof(struct tcindex_filter *),
                            GFP_KERNEL);
                        if (!p->h)
                                return -ENOMEM;
                        memset(p->h, 0, p->hash*sizeof(struct tcindex_filter *));
                }        }
        if (handle > p->mask)
                return -EINVAL;
Assuming the code is deterministic, it looks like this is a false positive.

It's good to see it wasn't a complete waste of time...

Indeed.  This run of the checker was not aware that kfree_s was a
freeing function (it was just looking for kfree).

Yeah.  Well, you get what you pay for.  ;-)  A student, Yu Ping, is hacking
on global analysis as we speak.

This is a checker mis-freature.  It looks like the state ``is a null
pointer'' does not have a rule allowing you to compare the pointer to
null again.  Easy to fix.
Apologies again for not warning that the messages had not been
examined.  I have to say, your code ran into a bunch of false positive
cases I hadn't seen yet (and this is after going over 200+ messages in
Linux, OpenBSD, and the Xok exokernel ;-).
