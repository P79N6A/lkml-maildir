It shouldn't be, but it seems like it's currently entangled a bit with
the acpi include files. OSC_ACTIVE_STATE_PWR_SUPPORT comes from
linux/pci-acpi.h.
I can't include acpi/acpi_bus.h though, since that ends up pulling in
asm/ files that don't exist on powerpc.
So if the probing is fixed, no, it's not ACPI-dependent. Seems like
something that's just as well to mask behind it until someone's actually
used and tested it on a non-ACPI platform though, no?
I would experiment with it but I believe our firmware turns off empty
links before the kernel is booted, we don't support hotplug at this time.
