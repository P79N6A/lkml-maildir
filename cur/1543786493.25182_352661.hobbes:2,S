Interesting - all my CF adapters (and I have several, some cheapo
noname things to some branded ones) are dumb pieces of hardware -
they merely convert the PCMCIA connector to a CF connector, just as
dumb as those 240V mains adapters.
Also, "CF" is just a different form factor of PCMCIA - don't get
mislead by the term "Compact Flash" - you can get "CF" network
cards, serial cards, bluetooth cards, etc as well.  They're exactly
the same as PCMCIA network, serial, bluetooth cards, just in a
smaller package.
If you have a CF adapter which behaves as you describe above, could
you please check what happens as far as PCMCIA goes when you unplug
the CF card - particularly what happens to cardctl status / cardctl
ident ?
