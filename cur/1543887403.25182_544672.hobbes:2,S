Hi, Kirill,
I've asked Paul Menage to help us with this scenario by adding a per-container task list.
Would you be ok, if we walked the per-container task list. We could further optimize
the routine by adding
1. A container id (avoid parsing file paths to uniquely identify a container)
2. If we cannot do (1), then cache container paths
The other option is of-course what Pavel posted, but I think the amortized cost of tracking
task state at the time of task state change or looping over tasks on demand should be the
same.
Do you agree in general with containerstats? How we build (walk the task list or at the
time of task state change) is flexible with containerstats.
Thanks for your comments!
