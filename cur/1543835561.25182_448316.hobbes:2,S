Board problem? After all, it has some very noxious DMI entries:
System Information
        Manufacturer: Intel Corporation
        Product Name: Nocona/Tumwater Customer Reference Board
        Version: Revision A0
        Serial Number: 0123456789
        UUID: 0A0A0A0A-0A0A-0A0A-0A0A-0A0A0A0A0A0A
... all of which are patently *wrong*.
You'd have to ask the people from Tyan what the hell they were smoking
when they blindly copied the Intel data.
At least the different CPU speed issue is a known bug, fixed by a
BIOS update. I'll postpone that until we have a working kernel fix,
for obvious reasons.
