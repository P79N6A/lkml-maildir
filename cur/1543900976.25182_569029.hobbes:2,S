sounds like int-A/B/C/D routing issues

this issue might be resolvable by quirking the bridgee chips and adjusting any 
APIC where needed. Unfortunately I don't know much about this but it's 
physically not possible from the e100 driver. The special (non-intel) card that 
has these 4 ports onboard contains a bridge chip itself which explains the 
issues. Even a BIOS issue could be the cause here.
Perhaps the linuxfirmwarekit will reveal more information. In any case, fixing 
this in software would be a gigantic effort.
