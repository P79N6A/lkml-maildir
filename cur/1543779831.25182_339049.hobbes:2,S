It doesn't seem to be used very much. Here's the `grep` of the
entire 2.6.12 source-tree:
size_t	shm_ctlmax = SHMMAX;
./ipc/shm.c
                     (actually only bits 25..16 get used since SHMMAX is so low)
./include/asm-m68k/shm.h
 	KERN_SHMMAX=34,         /* long: Maximum shared memory segment */
./include/linux/sysctl.h
  * SHMMAX, SHMMNI and SHMALL are upper limits are defaults which can
#define SHMMAX 0x2000000		 /* max shared seg size (bytes) */
#define SHMALL (SHMMAX/PAGE_SIZE*(SHMMNI/16)) /* max shm system wide (pages) */
./include/linux/shm.h
                     (actually only bits 25..16 get used since SHMMAX is so low)
./include/asm-h8300/shm.h
#ifndef SHMMAX
#define SHMMAX          0x003fa000
./include/asm-arm26/shmparam.h
 		.ctl_name	= KERN_SHMMAX,
./kernel/sysctl.c
