   I don't know how many cards won't support VLAN nowadays. But i will test
   these changes with my third party driver (just recompile it against pre-2.4.19)
   and report the results.
   
This will tell us exactly nothing.  It will continue to tell us
nothing until I make the change whereby NETIF_F_VLAN_CHALLENGED is set
by default and devices known to work are updated to clear it.
Please don't bother posting the results, we know what will happen.
