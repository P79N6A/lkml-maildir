Agreed. Actually, I was doing that earlier, with each retry 
calibrating for 1 HZ. But, once I moved to 10 HZ, I removed the retires.

I will try to improve the message in next revision of the patch.

Yes. I will send out a patch for x86-64 too, once the i386 patch 
gets finalized. I wanted to have a shorted patch reviewed first :).
