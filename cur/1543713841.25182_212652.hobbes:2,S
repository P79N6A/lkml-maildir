I have them all merged up here.  I made a number of small changes -
additional CONFIG_NUMA ifdefs, whitespace improvements, remove unneeded
arch_hugetlb_fault() implementation.  The core patch created two copies of
the same file in mempolicy.h, compile fix in mmap.c and a few other things.
It builds OK for NUMAQ, although NUMAQ does have a problem:
drivers/built-in.o: In function `acpi_pci_root_add':
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x22015): undefined reference to `pci_acpi_scan_root'
ppc64+CONFIG_NUMA compiles OK.
