3h - MEDIUM ERROR: indicates that the command terminated with a
non-recovered error caused by a flaw in the medium (the medium depends on
the device type)
Have to lookup the asc and ascq with ibm, as it varies by manufacturer.
0Bh 01h DTLPWRSOMCAE Warning - specified temperature exceeded
My guess is that you're seeing a temperature warning on a drive.
Which makes sense with the overheated server room.
