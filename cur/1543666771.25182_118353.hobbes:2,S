That is classic priority inversion.  It would be "nice" to find a fix 
for that :)  I think that the proposed action should not be triggered 
until there is some "notice" that something is wrong.  I suppose it 
could be a watchdog timer of some sort.  Still, if the priority 
inversion issue were solved, all the rest could be done in user land.
