OK. I'm running with deadline right now. But I guess this kernel
panic was caused by an LVM bug because lockdep reported problems with
LVM. Nobody responded to my bug report on the LVM mailing list (see
http://www.redhat.com/archives/linux-lvm/2007-February/msg00102.html
).
Non-working snapshots and no help from the mailing list convinced me
to ditch the lvm setup [1] in favour of linear software raid. This
means I can't do lvm-related tests any more.
BTW: Are ext3 filesystem sizes greater than 8T now officially
supported?
Thanks
Andre
