I didn't say you can avoid all pointers. I did say that 
for many projects, one can often avoid many pointers.  
And I certainly did not say that one needs global scope 
to do so. In fact, I said the opposite.

I think you don't understand what a reference is. 
A reference is just like a pointer, except that the 
signature is different.  It has nothing to do with the
ability to create or use libraries, or to create/use 
modular code.  
I was trying to say that by focusing on the concept
of a "reference" as opposed to the concept of a 
"pointer", you can write code that is *more* modular, 
not less.

Why not?
I've fixed hundreds of kernel bugs (which you don't 
see on this list because my fixes mostly go to the 
distros or other users) and nine out of ten of these 
are null-pointer derefs. 
Maybe I'm naive for thinking that "fewer pointers == 
fewer pointer bugs" but, hey its worth a shot.

What tool set are you refering to?  I am assuming 
that the code is 100% malleable: that one has
complete authority to redesign the way the system 
works, from the ground up.  If you do not have this 
freedom, but are forced to use someone-else's tool set,
then yes, you are SOL.  Furthermore, I would agree 
that mixing two different styles of coding in one 
project can lead to some nasty, ugly code.

Yes, that is right.  I'm not talking about opcodes.
That's not what the conversation is about.
What I am trying to say is that many people design 
code in such a way that they need to store lots of 
pointers in an assortment of structs.
I wanted to emphasize that there are other ways of
designing code, which has smaller needs for pointers
(and that this can be done without loosing modularity,
testability, debugability, and it can be done without 
resorting to global variables.)
