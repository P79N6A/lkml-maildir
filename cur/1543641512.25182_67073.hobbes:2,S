I went ahead on a new server and decided to set up a 2.4 kernel.  Since 
this was going to be a cdimage server I needed what ever HD power I could 
get out of it, and more than the standard 8 loop devices.  Looking around I 
found that I should just be able to pass the 'idebus' and 'max_loop' 
parameters to the kernel instead of having to rebuild a kernel.
Unfortunately this is not working.  dmesg for ide still shows the following:
         ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with 
idebus=xx
despite the fact that I've specified 'idebus=66' and the following lines note:
         VP_IDE: VIA vt82c596b (rev 12) IDE UDMA66 controller on pci00:07.1
and unless I actually pass 'max_loop=255' on an insmod line mounting the 
first loop device gives me:
         loop: loaded (max 8 devices)
I've tried this w/ the parameters as an append line both globaly and in the 
specific kernel stanza I'm loading.  I've tried just the idebus parameter 
alone since the max_loop parameter isn't as critical on boot (I have other 
scripts mounting the 'cds').
Am I doing something wrong here?  I just don't see where I've not done what 
the docs say.
