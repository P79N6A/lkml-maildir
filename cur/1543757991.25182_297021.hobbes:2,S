We have this already - it's called "yenta".
What you need to be aware of is that cardbus hardware is special - it
may change its resource requirements at any time, both in terms of the
number of BUS IDs it wishes to consume, and the number and size of
IO and memory resources.
Note also that if a cardbus bridge isn't on the root bus (it happens on
some laptops) these resource changes may impact on upstream bridges and
devices.
