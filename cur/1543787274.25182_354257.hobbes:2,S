Luben,
I have a vested interest in the improvement of the Linux SCSI Core and
wider adoption and support for SATA II and SAS controllers with their
associated domains and transport.

Proving a better design with a migration path for integration is the key
for success; however, I am not the person to be the political voice in the
process.  People will disagree in the process and the only counter to
remove blockage/adoption is in code.
James is king of the hill, and is reasonable to a point.  James also
follows a model of generalization v/s specific design.  Argh, this is not
going to be an easy one to explain or back away from now.  Erm, inclusive
API design is where I am wanting to go with this thought.
Have you and company considered the approach of mapping to a library of
sorts?
Cheers,
Andre
