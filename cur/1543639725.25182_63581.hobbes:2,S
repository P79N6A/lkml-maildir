OK, tried that against a slow disk (13 megs/sec write bandwidth).  2.5.31,
defalt writeback settings.
ext3 is misbehaving:

When the server is writing to ext2, it is good:

and the transfer takes 54 seconds, which is wirespeed.
The ext3 stall is going to require some thought - it's waiting on a previous
transaction commit so it can get in and modify an inode block again.
Are you _sure_ it was bad with ext2?    How long does
	dd if=/dev/zero of=foo bs=1M count=600 ; sync
take against that disk?
