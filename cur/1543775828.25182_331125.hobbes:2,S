NAME
       pthread_self - get the calling thread ID
SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>
       pthread_t pthread_self(void);
DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_self() function shall return the thread ID of the
calling thread.
pthread_self() works just fine for me. But... what makes you think a
"negative" value is a failure? What interpretation are you giving to
thread ID that negative woudl be wrong? A pthreads thread ID is just a
cookie you only can use to give back to the pthread library functions in
places where it's needed...
