Ok. I'll ask paulus about merging this.
Beware though that some G4s have a nasty bug that prevents
using the performance counter interrupt (and the thermal interrupt
as well). The problem is that if any of those fall at the same
time as the DEC interrupt, the CPU messes up it's internal
state and you lose SRR0/SRR1, which means you can't recover
from the exception.
Note also that it should be relatively easy to have the DEC timer
run faster than HZ. The code in timer.c can deal with spurrious DEC
interrupts, so you may improve your results by just making it fire
at 1Khz or higher.
Ben.
