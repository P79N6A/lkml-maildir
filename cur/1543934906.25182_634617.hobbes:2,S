Get a serial console?  Take another box, plug e.g. pl2303-based
usb-to-serial (several bucks these days) into it, stick null-modem
convertor (ditto) on its serial end and attach to ttyS0 on the
victim.  console=ttyS0 on victim, something like minicom on watcher
and tell it to capture log into file...
