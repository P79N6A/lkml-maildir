Oh, one other thing.  I'm pretty sure the rest of the errors you saw
were a result of the fact that you had your filesystem set to remount
the filesystem read-only after running into errors.  When the error
was detected, all existing updates to the filesystem are aborted (to
minimize damage to the filesystem), and that can leave the filesystem
in a somewhat inconsistent state, although nothing which e2fsck
shouldn't be able to fix.  
When running with the filesystem set to continue-with-errors, the only
problem which e2fsck picks up is the too-small-to-be-sane directory
entry problem.
