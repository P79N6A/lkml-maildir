Unfortunately that same mv has some serious bugs.
Recently a simple `mv * dir/' copied files on my disk as well as moving
them.  Same filesystem.  (This only happens occasionally -- actually the
erroneous copy happens lots but it usually deletes the copies after
writing them!)
(Bug reported to GNU).
