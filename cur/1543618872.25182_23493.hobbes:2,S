Hi!
I've been trying to compile the Symbios 53c416 SCSI host adapter but it 
chokes when trying to compile sym53c416.c. AFAIK, this happens with 
2.5.1 and later kernels and did _not_ happen with any 2.4 kernel. I 
reproduced this on both 2.5.1, 2.5.2 and 2.5.2-dj3. Here's the output:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/local/src/devel/linux/include -Wall 
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer 
-fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 
-march=i586    -c -o sym53c416.o sym53c416.c
sym53c416.c: In function `sym53c416_intr_handle':
sym53c416.c:362: `io_request_lock' undeclared (first use in this 
function)
sym53c416.c:362: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
sym53c416.c:362: for each function it appears in.)
make[3]: *** [sym53c416.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/devel/linux/drivers/scsi'
make[2]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/devel/linux/drivers/scsi'
make[1]: *** [_subdir_scsi] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/devel/linux/drivers'
make: *** [_dir_drivers] Error 2
If it is of any help, the .config used goes attached.
I'm a newbie though I see <linux/blk.h> is included. Still it says 
io_request_lock is undeclared... should be trivial but goes beyond my 
knowledge :)
Thanks in advance
