No problem. The remapping code is all but simple.

Are you sure?
The mappings in page_table_a are created by C code in the
kernel/hypervisor, right? One of the mappings is an identity mapping,
and the other one is mapping the control page at the same address as a
"NX-safe" page in the kernel/hypervisor.
When we are about to kexec into the new kernel, the kernel/hypervisor
is accessing the regular page tables as usual. machine_kexec() then
jumps to the assembly code where we disable interrupts and switch page
tables. Could you please clarify what you mean by "page table
switching function"?
The only conflict that I see is when the two mappings in page_table_a
happen to be on the same address. But that is not a problem,
everything should work as expected in that case too. The page_table_a
code should in that case just use one mapping instead of two.
I could of course be wrong and I'd really like to hear all doubts
people have regarding my "page_table_a" solution. So if anyonel thinks
that there's a problem somewhere please give me a detailed
description.

This function, you write "uses page_table_a". Do you mean that the
function allocates it? Or fills it in? Or maybe switches to it? Please
clarify!

But doesn't a static set of pages used for page_table_a just mean that
you are wasting valuable unswappable kernel memory? Also, how can you
be sure that the static pages are in a DMA-safe address range?

I do not really see the benefit with this static solution actually.
The special section also feels a bit complicated. Maybe it fits your
big picture better and that is of course good.
It does however make the Xen porting more difficult. =(

Agreed.
