The way how things are in 2.4 (I haven't looked too deeply into 2.5/2.6),
IPv6 TCP and UDP do NEED IPv4 TCP code to make most of TCP logic.
With UDP the amount of logic in kernel side is a lot simpler, and
I do think the code was in essense duplicated.

Because of the degree of present sharing: no.

IPv6's TCP is (was) just that kind of "work around" to handle differences
in IP addresses.
