because it is ok to have a protocol family compiled but being unable
(i.e. oops) to instantiate a socket in that family? I see what you
mean... I can only imagine very rare situations when that is desirable -
e.g. on an distr. install kernel, it is better to have no valid sock cache
than panic on boot.
