Here are the numbers with the basic patchsets.  But I guess I should
do another round with adding 7 more void*'s to represent additional
namespaces.
(intervals are for 95% CI, tests were each run 15 times)
           |  with nsproxy  |   without nsproxy |
kernbench  | 68.90 +/- 0.21 |   69.06 +/- 0.22  |
dbench     | 386.0 +/- 26.6 |   388.4 +/- 21.0  |
tbench     | 391.6 +/- 8.00 |   389.4 +/- 10.95 |
