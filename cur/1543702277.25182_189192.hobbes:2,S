Subject: SYM53C8XX (1010) not working in 2.6.0?

hey all-
	I've been trying to get 2.6.0 to work on my desktop and I'm
having no luck with it. 
	This computer has a "LSI Logic / Symbios Logic 53c1010 Ultra3
SCSI Adapter" onboard, that works fine in 2.4.x with the SYM53C8XX
driver. I've compiled 2.6.0 with CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_2=y, but it
doens't seem to work. When I boot, I don't see any scsi
initialization, and my root drive isn't connected, and I get a vfs
kernel panic that root can't be mounted.
	I'm almost positive no scsi stuff is being done in the kenrel,
because in 2.4 I could see it pause while it did all the script
loading stuff, but in 2.6 I see nothing like that, although I never
get keybaord control to be able to scroll back and see what messages
the kernel is printing.
	So, two questions -- why does the 2.6 driver work with my
53c1010 card, and why don't I have keyboard control on boot?
thanks,
--dave
