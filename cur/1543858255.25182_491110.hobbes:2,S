Right!  The problem here is that it may do more harm than good.
May I suggest a smarter way to filter these spammers, by just whitelisting 
email addresses of valid posters, after sending a confirmation for the first

addresses, I would certainly expect some real action by abused email address 
owners.
Thanks!
