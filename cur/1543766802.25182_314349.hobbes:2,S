Hi Andrew,
I have several patches cleaning up Toshiba and I8K drivers a bit and I
was wondering if you could add them to -mm. I8K patches have been sent
to LKML earlier and were tested (although I have dropped sysfs export
patch, there were some objections from Greg).
01-toshiba-cleanup
  Toshiba legacy driver cleanup:
  - use module_init/module_exit for initialization instead of using
    #ifdef MODULE and calling tosh_init manually from drivers/char/misc.c
  - do not explicitly initialize static variables
  - some whitespace and formatting cleanups
02-i8k-lindent.patch
  - pass through Lindent to change 4 spaces identation to TABs
03-i8k-use-dmi.patch
  - Change to use stock dmi infrastructure instead of homegrown
    parsing code. The driver now requires box's DMI data to match
    list of supported models so driver can be safely compiled-in
    by default without fear of it poking into random SMM BIOS
    code. DMI checks can be ignored with i8k.ignore_dmi option.
04-i8k-seqfile.patch
  - Change proc code to use seq_file.
05-i8k-cleanup.patch
  - use module_{init|exit} instead of old style #ifdef MODULE
    code, some formatting changes 
06-i8k-new-signatures.patch
  - add BIOS signatures of a newer Dell laptops, also there can be
    more than one temperature sensor reported by BIOS.
Thanks!
