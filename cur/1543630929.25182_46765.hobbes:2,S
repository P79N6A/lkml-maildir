Nope.  It depends on your ATA controller, and the vast majority of
controllers currently on the market use PIO.
You are thinking about PIO versus DMA, which are the two data transfer
modes of ATA.  We are talking about a situation which replaces PIO with
MMIO, but otherwise looks and acts similarly to PIO+DMA.
