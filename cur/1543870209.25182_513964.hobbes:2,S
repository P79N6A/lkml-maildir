AFAICS, "still active" is printed from ata_host_suspend() if a device 
(disk) on the host to be suspended doesn't have ATA_DFLAG_SUSPENDED flag 
set. This flag is only set in ata_eh_suspend(), which is only called from 
ata_eh_recover(), like this:
generic_error_handler()
ata_bmdma_drive_eh()
ata_do_eh()
ata_eh_recover()
ata_eh_suspend()
dev->flags |= ATA_DFLAG_SUSPENDED;
but I don't understand why the error handler should be envoked? Should the 
"disk" be suspended before the host and is it when the eh should set the 
flag? If my guess is right - why doesn't the disk get suspended on my 
machine? Shall I suspend it explicitely from userspace? I do "hdparm -Y", 
and it does stop spinning", but I still get the error.
Thanks
