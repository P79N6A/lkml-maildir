I think this would be a worthy change.  It's the same kind of thing that
we're planning for memory hotplug on ppc64: initiate a probe in /sys
somewhere, and get a few hotplug events in short order.  The only
difference is that we'll probably require a write for the probe to
trigger.  You don't want a 'grep -r foo /sys' to cause probes, do you?

Isn't it a little naughty to be spitting out so many values in a /sys
file?
