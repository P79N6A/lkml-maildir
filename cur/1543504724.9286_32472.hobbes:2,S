Subject: 2.3.10 won't start init

It won't start /bin/sh either.  The thing that gets me is that I have a
2.3.10 that I built that does work!  When I build another one and boot it,
it won't start init.  Maybe it's some config option, but I've tried so many
combinations.  I don't have the original config that I used on the 2.3.10
that works (doh).
Most of the time it just hangs, no diagnostic messages, not even the INIT:
version 2.74 message.  I few times I've seen it complain about there not
being version info in libc.6.so (or something like that - I didn't write it
down (doh2)) and that it needs version information in there, then it hangs.
It's libc-2.1.1.so, and I'm using RedHat 6.0 if that makes any difference.
I could really use some advice.  TIA.
Regards,
Brad
