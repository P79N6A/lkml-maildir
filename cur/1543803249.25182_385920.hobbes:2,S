Yes. For hardware debugging.

Multiple rfmon devices make sense in hypothetical or future hardware if
different channels are supported on one WiPHY at once, but the rfmon
device shall be restricted to a single one. Since we probably need a way
to deactivate virtual devices anyway, having a config option to
suspend/resume all others doesn't make sense -- userspace programs can
just as well cycle over them and do it themselves.
