Hello,
my apologies if that's old news, but I had reported the effect 
that my Intuos GD-1212 that worked with SuSE-8.0 (2.4.18) no 
longer worked with SuSE-8.1 (2.4.19). The bug was knows at SuSE 
as #22403, but they were unable to provide a solution so far.
Thus I did a diff to the kernel sources. It seems that the 
change in drivers/usb/wacom.c from RCS revision .122 to 1.23 
(made by vijtech@suse.cz) broke detection of move events in an 
obvious way (see lines 241 in 2.4.18 and lines 285 in 2.4.19):
wacom->x and wacom->y are no longer set in 2.4.19!
I'll attach my suggested fix (not tested).
Regards,
Ulrich Windl
P.S. I failed to get any programming info from Wacom, even if 
the documentation provided with the tablet said Wacom would 
support developers. If anybody here knows a source of 
information, please tell me...
