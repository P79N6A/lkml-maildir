From the architectural point of view, what odds against making it a
module of its own? Dependancies are resolved by modprobe, so users should
be fine.
There are other library-like parts in the kernel where an object is
built statically when at least one needing driver is static, a module
when all nedding drivers are modules, or not at all but appears are a
config option when no in-kernel driver needs it.

Ugly. But I've seen worse.
