   thanks for the response but I am still confused - I have a disk that 
requires 2.4.21-ac4 + libata5 (from Jeff Garzik), otherwise it does not 
recognize anything above 137GB (it recognizes disk as 250GB but all 
read/write attempts fail).
   2.4.21 vanilla: freezes on boot
   2.4.21-ac4 (SCSI_ATA): read/write above 1376GB fails
   2.4.21-ac4 + libata5: works (libata changes manually merged in)
   is this disk going to work without libata patch?
   MB: intel D865PERL
   Maxtor 250GB SATA disk
   here's what kernel thinks about the disk (from dmesg):
