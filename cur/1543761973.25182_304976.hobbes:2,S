Half guess, half with data to prove: it must be the variable driver_setup
initialization.  If compiled as built-in, driver_setup is initialized to
zero for all of its member variables, which isn't the fastest setting. If
compiled as module, it gets first class treatment with shinny performance
setting.  Goofing around, this patch appears to be giving higher throughput.
Before:
/dev/sdc:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   92 MB in  3.03 seconds =  30.32 MB/sec
After:
/dev/sdc:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  174 MB in  3.02 seconds =  57.61 MB/sec
