Hello,
using MMC/SD support on my PXA270 based board I get this error:
   mmc0: unrecognised SCR structure version 1
when I insert a MINISD card.
I tried to find on the net some specifications for the SCR structure
version 1 but I found nothing useful... someone has a similar problem
or can suggest to me where I can find such specifications?
Thanks,
Rodolfo
