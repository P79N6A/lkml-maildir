Its flaky. The XServers need some patches to make it behave correctly. We 
have working X servers that do this. Alot of configuring has to be done 
to. This also has been solved. We also had it working with multiple sound 
cards.
  BTW this is what the company I'm creating right now does. I just wanted 
to have a actually working product before I formed a company.
