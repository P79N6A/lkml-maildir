That is what I what I have been thinking as well, storing a user
struct on each mount point seems sane, plus it allows per user mount
rlimits which is major plus.  Especially since we seem to be doing
accounting only for user mounts a per user rlimit seems good.
To get the user we should be user fs_uid as HPA suggested.
Finally I'm pretty certain the capability we should care about in
this context is CAP_SETUID.  Instead of CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
If we have CAP_SETUID we can become which ever user owns the mount,
and the root user in a container needs this, so he can run login
programs.  So changing the appropriate super user checks from
CAP_SYS_ADMIN to CAP_SETUID I think is the right thing todo.
With the CAP_SETUID thing handled I'm not currently seeing any adverse
implications to using this in containers.
Ok.  Now that I have a reasonable approximation of the 10,000 foot
view now to see how the patches match up.
