The mc part does pci parity, it is separate from the
chipset driver, I have even used the _mc part on a
Itanium with no chipset driver at all and had it report
parity errors properly, so I expect just the mc driver
to work.
You would need the k8 module for the cpu, but that is
only if you want ECC checking also.
If you got the _mc loaded do a "sysctl -a | grep mc" and
see what things are set how, and reset if necessary
check_pci_parity to 1.
