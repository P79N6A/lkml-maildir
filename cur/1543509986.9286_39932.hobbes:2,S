I saw this (ping of >1s on a local lan) with 2.2.(>12) and a 3com 3c509.  I 
don't have the tcpdumps anymore, but what solved the problem for me was to 
compile the kernel with gcc 2.7.2.3 instead of pgcc 1.1.2.  iirc, tcpdump on 
the host showed the packet going out and the response coming back immediatly, 
but I'd run the ping program, and the request on tcpdump would show up about 
1s later (or maybe it was the ping program got the response about 1s later, I 
can't remember which one now.).
