Linux is an operating system that does all that stuff for you.
In fact, it prevents user code from touching hardware ar all.
If you learn the Unix/Posix stuff, you will never have to play
with assembly language again.
Linux operates all of the standard PC hardware in a standard
way that allows programs to use open()/close()/read()/write()/
and ioctl() to "talk" to hardware in a standard high-efficiency
way. If you have additional hardware that Linux doesn't "know"
about, then you can write a device-driver (module) for it.
