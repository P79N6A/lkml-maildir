SCHED_FIFO is dangerous - it is easy to essentially lock up your box
simply because the process in question (e.g. video decoder) just runs
forever (e.g. bug causing busyloop, and/or others do not get to run
(no other processes in the same priority class). Or they (X.org, for
displaying your video and handling user input) run only for short
amounts of time only, giving a borked responsiveness experience to
the user.
It was about time SCHED_{BATCH,IDLE} came along ;-)

Even making mplayer -19 will not completely cause FAH to get zero CPU
time if the Regular Desktop Processes Everybody Needs would already
max out the CPU.
