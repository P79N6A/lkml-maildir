btw., does anyone know about some reliable way to stress and measure RCU 
completion performance, via some real userspace app? I think there used 
to be an open-tons-of-files thing that unearthed the 
RCU-completion-single-threadness bottleneck a year or two ago? Anyone 
got a link to it (or to some other performance tool for RCU)?
