If remote wakeup is disabled, the device will remain suspended until 
something tells it to wake up.

Yes, there is.  Consider that in many cases (think especially of embedded 
platforms) devices have more than 2 power states, on or suspended.  That's 
true even for PCI and ATA.  Each sort of bus has its own set of possible 
power states, and it's hopeless to try and unify them.

Like I said, drivers need to make their own individual choices.  
Suspending during "close" may not always be best for all devices.  But for
many it is acceptable and a lot better than nothing.
