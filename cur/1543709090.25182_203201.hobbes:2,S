Last time I tried (2.6.1) PM_DISK was the only suspend mechanism that worked
on my vaio with ACPI enabled (PGC-FX701). I had not time (my humble
apologies to Nigel) to make more tests, I've been swamped with a conference
deadline, but I can try to help finding out the problem in the next weeks, I
hope.
