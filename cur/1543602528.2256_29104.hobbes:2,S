Hello,
I'm sure 2.4.10 is an "uncomfortably large changeset" (Linus).
I've been running a 2.4.9 machine using ext2, 192MB RAM, on a 
K6-III-400 (66*6).
I compiled 2.4.10 two times, so it's highly probable it was no
hardware flaw (high temperature or so). Compiler is gcc 2.95.2
(release).
The oopses are reproducible, albeit the message changes.
After the start of "init" I always experience an OOPS message with
2.4.10,
most times after some demons have been started.
It completely locked up the machine, and because it was an Oops
in an interrupt handler, the machine did not sync. I therefore
don't have a "correct" oops here.
I don't know If I will get my harddisk back in a few hours, but I have
__written__ some info from the screen onto a sheet of paper like:

<0> kernel panic: aiee, killing interrupt handler
in interrupt handler - not syncing
--------------------
I have some old a.out format binaries that are still used, I think
some of them even at this early point of OOPSing.
I try to get my harddisk back: please tell me what I can do to provide
you with more information.
[I hope I get my ".config" back, to post the relevent lines here]
Greetings,
Enver
