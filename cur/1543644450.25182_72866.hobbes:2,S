You are arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.
Sure, there are lotso benchmarks which show how fast user level threads
can context switch amongst each other and it is always faster than going
into the kernel.  So what?  What do you think causes a context switch in
a threaded program?  What?  Could it be blocking on I/O?  Like 99.999%
of the time?  And doesn't that mean you already went into the kernel to
see if the I/O was ready?  And doesn't that mean that in all the real
world applications they are already doing all the work you are arguing
to avoid?
