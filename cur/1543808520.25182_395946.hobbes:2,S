Yes, IRQ_NONE means "I don't have a clue why this IRQ handler was called -
none of my device registers indicate that anything needs servicing".
The core kernel IRQ handling will see that as a signal that perhaps the
hardware is busted and ultimately it will disable the entire IRQ line so
the machine can continue to struggle along.

Well, yes, that expression.  Generally if you get all the types right and
avoid typecasting, the compiler will shout at you about 64-bit-brokenness.

I guess a waitqueue would be nicer.  I don't recall seeing drivers doing
anything really fancy like this in response to a suspend request though.
