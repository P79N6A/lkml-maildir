It is not redundant because in theory CONFIG_EISA could exist without
CONFIG_ISA.

Why not send me an incremental patch for these cleanups, on top of the
cleanup patch that (I hope!) Andrzej will send, in respond to me last
reply.
2.4 will be around for quite a while, and Config.in cleanups should
continue to go in.  Sure work should be directed towards 2.5..... but if
somebody sends me a 2.4 patch for drivers/net/Config.in cleanup, I sure
as hell will apply it.
