I would disagree - OBSOLETE to me means just that - that module is 
obsolete. Minix FS, OSS (as opposed to ALSA), and the old non-SCSI, 
non-IDE HD interfaces would be OBSOLETE.
Besides, I have seen cases where Firewire modules wouldn't build for 
some period of time - would you deem them OBSOLETE?
