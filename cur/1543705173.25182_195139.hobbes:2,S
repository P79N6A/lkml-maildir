Coupla quick questions for you, while we're on the topic.
I get lots of fails against 2.6.2-rc2-mm1; will the -rcX kernels
  be addressed, or will the patches only be against non-rc kernels?
  What about -mm kernels?
Also, how does this differ from what is currently in the vanilla
  kernels?
Thanks!
