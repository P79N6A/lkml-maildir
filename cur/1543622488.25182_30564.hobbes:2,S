In article <15482.53400.786310.950430@sodium.transmeta.com> of
linux.dev.kernel, you write:

For the binary format to be compatible, there is only one solution: if
PAGE_CACHE_SIZE > 4096, you decompress more than one cramfs chunk into
the same page.
If the binary format can change, then you could implement the same
solution used in zisofs.
FWIW, currently on Linux I believe:
	4096 <= PAGE_CACHE_SIZE <= 32768
