They are Cisco configuration, it won't do you much good.  All the traffic
goes in/out through a Cisco 2610, we have a full T1 and we clamped all 
TCP traffic at .75Mbit.  Still didn't help even though we verified that
it was indeed clamping down on the traffic.
I'm not sure why you are arguing this, if you have a fat pipe feeding into
a small pipe and you are trying to throttle at far end of the small pipe
isn't it obvious that you can't make that work?  It's not the packets we
send, it's the packets you send.  And all the flow control stuff is per
connection, not per pipe.
