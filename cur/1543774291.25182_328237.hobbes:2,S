One, you were using V3 not V4.
Two, this bug you mention is probably not an fs bug.  rm first creates a
list of names, and then removes them. 
reiser@linux:~/scratch> touch fufu
reiser@linux:~/scratch> touch fifu
reiser@linux:~/scratch> rm *fu fi*
rm: cannot remove `fifu': No such file or directory
Your file either somehow got removed before rm got to it, or rm somehow
got to it twice.  Vitaly, can you look at the error handling by rm and
see if it can get to things twice when it hits an error or if you can
otherwise figure this out?  If I remember right, I have hit this myself
for non-reiserfs filesystems, and I never investigated it.
