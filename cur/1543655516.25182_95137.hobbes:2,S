It's rather annoying and counter-intuitive to have:
crw-r-----    1 root     kmem       1,   2 Sep  8 21:56 /dev/kmem
but to have the following code fragment give:
int fd;
	fd = open("/dev/kmem", O_RDONLY);
	if(fd == -1) {
		fprintf(stderr, "Can't open /dev/kmem: %s\n", strerror(errno));
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}
Can't open /dev/kmem: Operation not permitted
with a user in the kmem group.
Also, the utility I'm writing doesn't need write access, so why give it to
the process in the first place?
