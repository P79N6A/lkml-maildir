Ah yes I believe I know this issue. The problem is the parent spinning madly 
waiting for the child and it is the parent that starves the child. While this 
is not a fix, if you can reproduce the problem can you try changing 
CHILD_PENALTY in kernel/sched.c from 50 to 100 and see if that makes the 
problem go away? I mentioned this hidden in a thread a while ago, and am 
trying to get a reasonable fix.
