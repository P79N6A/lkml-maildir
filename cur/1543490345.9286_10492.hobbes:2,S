Subject: RFC on kernel upgrade from 2.0.33 to 2.2.

I have an GW2000 box with Adaptec 2940UW, 3C905 and a few other odds and
ends, nothing really special, but I need to rebuild the existing kernel
because I'm running out of FD's and I figure if I've got to rebuilt, why
not look at an upgrade.
Is there a FAQ that addresses these type of jumps and what to look for?
For example, while the existing libraries all work?  Will my PPP setup
still function? etc..  I'm just trying to avoid the 'blow-a-hole' in my
foot senario since the machine is physically 4500 miles from me...
Thanks...
Barry
