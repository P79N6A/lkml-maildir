Ah -- i got rid of that by changing the rodata code to not do this
except for the debugging case

CPA: Only unmap kernel init pages in text mapping when CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA is set
Otherwise the kernel will likely always run with 4K pages instead of 2MB pages,
which is costly in terms of TLBs.

But you're right that would be an useful feature. But wouldn't it require
aligning rodata to 2MB in the vmlinux to be really effective?
