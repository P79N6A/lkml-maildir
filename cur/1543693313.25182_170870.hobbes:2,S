Systems like this are not uncommon, I agree.  But also for systems like
this, the current code works just fine (small number of fixed devices.)
I haven't heard anyone complain about memory usage for a normal system
(99.9% of the systems out there.)
Also,  remember that in 2.7 I'm going to make device numbers random so
you will have to use something like udev to control your /dev tree.
Slowly weaning yourself off of a static /dev during the next 2 years or
so might be a good idea :)
