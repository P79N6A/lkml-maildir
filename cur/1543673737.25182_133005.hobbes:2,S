Not even malicious. For years, it was accepted that if you had
physical possesion of a computing system, you could do anything
with it that it was capable of.
Not so, with the latest Red Hat distribution (9). You can no longer
set init=/bin/bash at the boot prompt.... well you can set it, but
then you get an error about killing init. This caused a neighbor
a lot of trouble when she accidentally put a blank line in the
top of /etc/passwd. Nobody could log-in. I promised to show her
how to "break in", but I wasn't able to. I had to take her hard-disk
to my house, mount it, and fix the password file. All these "attempts"
at so-called security do is make customers pissed.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
