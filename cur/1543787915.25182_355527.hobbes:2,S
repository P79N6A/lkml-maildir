Yes, it is. In addition to your comments, Tom, it's worth looking in
the corresponding head.S, head_4xx.S or whatever files to see that the
kernel is called much like a regular function with arguments in
registers r3 upwards. You'll find most of what you want to know by
going through from early_init onwards.
