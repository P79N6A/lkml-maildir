I don't get this.  If we add a couple of members to task_struct, it 
can't be reused.  The values will be the same across all tasks, but the 
memory will be gone (including tasks which aren't virtual machines).

I'm hoping that CONFIG_KVM will be enabled on most distro kernels, so we 
need to optimize for that case as well.
