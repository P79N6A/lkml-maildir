Hi, Linus,
Summary: many Modules like serial.o can cause Oopses when inserted over a
         comiled-in version of the same module.

The Oops can happen on any system i can think of when one installs
serial.o as module, later decides to compile it in and later somehow
the module gets loaded. One calls rmmod serial and when sombody accesses
the device, the Oops happens.
The fact is that not a user process explicitely requests overloading the
module, but kmod itself does it automatically e.g. when setserial is called.
The fact is, that inserting a compiled-in module often leads to an Oops,
e.g. also with sg.o, sr_mod.o if I remember correctly, but there are more.
Anyway, this patch prevents most of them to be get overloaded, it checks
the exports of the module and looks if they are already present i the kernel.
This fixes most oops possibilies and doesn't hurt trivial modules like dummy,
which don't export symbols, so they can still be overloaded.
Agreed?
