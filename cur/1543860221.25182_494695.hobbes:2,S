Hi, Jiri!
I'm so sorry, I don't know what I smoked yesterday, but the latest
version you've sent me does not have this problem anymore! I think I
copied compiled module to modules directory for different kernel and
thus tested old code all the time. BTW, should you tell me that the
ports are now called /dev/ttyMIx instead of /dev/ttyMx, I think I'd
notice my mistake earlier. Yes, in fact I didn't test any version where
ports are called /dev/ttyMIx until now! In particular, it means that
maybe some of the recent changes you've made yesterday based on my wrong
reports are not in fact required.
Anyway, the only mxser-specific problem that currently remains for
me and that I didn't see before, is the following:
# rmmod mxser_new
Trying to free already-free IRQ 58
Trying to free nonexistent resource <0000000000009000-000000000000903f>
Trying to free nonexistent resource <0000000000008800-0000000000008800>
