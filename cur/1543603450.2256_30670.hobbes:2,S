Actually, the way I first started looking at this problem is the result
of a few attacks that have happened on our network.  It's not just a
while(1) sendto(); UDP spamming program that triggers it -- TCP SYN
floods show the problem as well, and _there is no way_ to protect against
this without using syncookies or some similar method that can only be
done on the receiving TCP stack only.
At one point, one of our webservers received 30-40Mbit/sec of SYN packets
sustained for almost 24 hours.  Needless to say, the machine was not
happy.
