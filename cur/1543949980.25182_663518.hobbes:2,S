Thanks, this (and no success with PREEMPT_NONE) changes the perspective a bit.
Could you set your kernel tree to the guilty commit

and see if manually reverting only ide-taskfile.c change fixes the problem
(so we know that we are looking at the right place).
Also Alt-SysRq-T output for the hang would probably be very useful to tell
what is going on, maybe it is possible to still get it before system fully
stops?
I must admit that after auditing the patch & code for n-th time I still fail
to see the source of the problem (especialy now that the theory about exposing
races in the tuning code has also failed) as the _only_ changes introduced by
the guilty commit are that we are using different rq->cmd_type and testing for
rq->special instead of rq->buffer but both should be NULL. [ as it can be seen
be looking at ide_cmd_ioctl(), execute_drive_cmd() and ide_end_drive_cmd() ]
If anybody has some ideas on what could be wrong please help, in the meantime
I'm going to take a look at smartd code...
Thanks,
Bart
