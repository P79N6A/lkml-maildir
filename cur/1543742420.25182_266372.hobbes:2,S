Wow, now I'm really interested, how this fits together with this mail: 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109884946914484
What I'm asking for there is the _minimum_ amount of information to do 
exactly the above. Is there somewhere a provision like "unless you give 
this data to evil bk haters"?
To make this easier to understand for everyone, here is a simple example: 
a very simple network protocol would be to extend the current commit mails 
with the identifiers one can already find in bkcvs, so they can be put 
into the correct order.
The million Euro question is now: How can he decline me this information 
on the one hand (note: I didn't ask that he gives me this himself) and on 
the other hand how will he prevent me from getting to this information, if 
someone does exactly the above?
For the answer to this question stay tuned and don't switch the channel...
bye, Roman
