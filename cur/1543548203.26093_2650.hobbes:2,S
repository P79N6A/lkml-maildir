Why, yes it does, IMO.  In fact ... [snaps fingers] you appear to have
rediscovered a centuries-old argument, and the single biggest problem
many of us Protestants have with Roman Catholic doctrine & practice.
[Now, centuries-old theological arguments may well be of supreme
importance in some ways -- an undeniably subjective and personal
judgment -- but in terms of Linux kernel development they are usually
considered even more off-topic than the latest clever AC quote.]
