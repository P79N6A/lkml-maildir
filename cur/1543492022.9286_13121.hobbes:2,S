Hello,
don't ask me why, but someone mounted his swappartition as VFAT 
filesystem in 2.2.5. The partition was on 8:6 (SCSI with aic7xxx).
The kernel spit out a few hundred messages about not implemented 
blcok size (512 vs. 4096), and then no processed could be started.
Note, there was no kernel panic, and virtual consoles could still be 
switched, but not even the magic SysReq keys worked any longer.
I did not try to reproduce the effect, but maybe someone can have a 
look...
Regards,
Ulrich
