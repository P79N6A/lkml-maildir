One of the things which linux-next could/should do is to help weed out the
silly build breaks, typos, missing documentation updates, missed checkpatch
opportunities, etc, etc. As well as real bugs.
So it would not be efficient for David to do all this queue-cleaning
*prior* to putting the tree into linux-next, because more stuff will pop up
anyway.
So perhaps a better workflow would be keep the linux-next trees all messy,
and then each developer can consolidate, rebase, join and drop things prior
to sending their individual trees to Linus.
If so, then git could perhaps help, by retaining sufficient metadata for
the maintainer to track the fact that this-patch-here fixes
that-patch-there.
