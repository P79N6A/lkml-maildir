Applied, thanks.
Hm, in looking at this, I know the majority of people who want
CONFIG_HOTPLUG probably do not run with CONFIG_PCI_HOTPLUG as the
hardware's still quite rare.  To force those people to keep around all
of the PCI quirks functions and tables after init happens, is a bit
cruel.  I wonder if it's time to start having different subsystems
modify __devinit depending on their config variables.
Does this sound like a good idea?  If so, I can probably knock up
something for the PCI code pretty easily (yes, I'll keep in mind CardBus
stuff, not all hotplug pci is on servers...)
__pci_devinit anyone?  :)
thanks,
greg k-h
