Subject: Change i386 assembler/disassembler for SIB with INDEX==4

I am proposing to change i386 assembler/disassembler for SIB with
INDEX==4
http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=658
It will change the assembler output for (%ebx,[1248]). I am not too
worried about the disassembler output since assembler can't generate
SIB with INDEX==4 directly today. Any comments?
