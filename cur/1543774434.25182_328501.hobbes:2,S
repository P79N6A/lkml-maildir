I haven't tried with kernels earlier then 2.6.7, when I ran into the 
problem there I tried upgradeing to see if it fixed it and it didn't.
here is /proc/interrupts with eth0 and eth1 in use
happy1-p:~# cat /proc/interrupts

here is after doing ifconfig

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
