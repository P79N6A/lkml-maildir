Subject: upgrade to 2.2.1pre4 compile failure
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I can't seem to find any info about this, but I suspect it is an order
related issue.
I tried to upgrade from a new plain vanilla RH5.2 install plus redhat posted
upgrades, to the new kernel 2.2.1pre4-ac6
I applied the pre4 patch, then the ac-6 patch.  The latter resulted in a
number of REVERSED PATCH or PATCH ALREADY APPLIED messages.  I looked at
some of those, and I didn't see any problems so I went on (Maybe my first 
mistake).
During the kernel build, I got the following:
make[1]: Entering directory `/rh52_usr_alt/src/linux/mm'
make all_targets
make[2]: Entering directory `/rh52_usr_alt/src/linux/mm'

make[1]: *** [first_rule] Error 2

I suspect I needed to upgrade some things (I grabbed all of those items in
DOCUMENTATION/CHANGES) before I started, but I wasn't sure WHEN to upgrade all
of them.
Will the old kernel (2.0.36) run with everything in the changes file upgraded, 
or do I upgrade some of them first, build the kernel and then upgrade the rest?
If the latter, which are required BEFORE I build the kernel?
I was trying to build everything here, and not use any binary rpm's.
thanks,
