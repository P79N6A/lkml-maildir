Hi all,
  Can some one send me pointer(s) to the recent API changes in the tty 
layer that has gone in to linux-2.6.14.xxx.  As Damir pointed out in his 
mail yesterday, currently jsm driver is broken in 2.6.14-rc4-mm1 
kernel.  I am trying to debug the jsm driver at my end.  Any help in 
this is appreciated.
