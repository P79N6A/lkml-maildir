ARM26 does.  On ARM, we play some games to weld to page tables together.
(We also duplicate them to give us a level of independence from the MMU
architecture and to give us space for things like young and dirty bits.)
As far as Linux is concerned, a 2nd level page table is one struct page
and L1 entries are two words in size.
I wrote up some docs on this and threw them into a comment in
include/asm-arm/pgtable.h...
