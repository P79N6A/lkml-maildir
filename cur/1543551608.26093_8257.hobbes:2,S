The error you were getting is the error I get on my system when I
incorrectly try to access the SCSI cdrom device instead of of the SCSI
generic.  
See:
[root@thud linux]# cdrecord dev=/dev/sr1 -inq 
Cdrecord 1.9 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1995-2000 Jrg Schilling
scsidev: '/dev/sr1'
devname: '/dev/sr1'
scsibus: -2 target: -2 lun: -2
cdrecord: No such file or directory. Cannot open SCSI driver.
cdrecord: For possible targets try 'cdrecord -scanbus'. Make sure you are root.
[root@thud linux]# 
However, when I correctly reference the SCSI generic device, it works:
[root@thud linux]# cdrecord dev=/dev/sg1 -inq 
Cdrecord 1.9 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1995-2000 Jrg Schilling
scsidev: '/dev/sg1'
devname: '/dev/sg1'
scsibus: -2 target: -2 lun: -2
Linux sg driver version: 3.1.17
Using libscg version 'schily-0.1'
Device type    : Removable CD-ROM
Version        : 2
Response Format: 2
Capabilities   : SYNC 
Vendor_info    : 'YAMAHA  '
Identifikation : 'CRW4416S        '
Revision       : '1.0j'
Device seems to be: Generic mmc CD-RW.
[root@thud linux]#
In short, I don't think there was a problem, simply incorrect usage of
cdrecord.
