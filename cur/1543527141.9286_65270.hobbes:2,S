I'm still using libc5, and all I can say is that it's working perfect
here.
The ping version I'm using is from inet6-apps (from inner.net). I don't
seem to have kept my old version of it, because it happely does both ipv4
and ipv6 without a problem.
I'm willing to try any other version if you say where I can find the
source. (no rpm's)
