This is why __pagevec_release() has the refcount check inside the lock.
If someone else grabbed a ref to the page (also inside the lock) via
the LRU, __pagevec_release doesn't free it.
So the rule could be stated as: the page gets freed when there are
no references to it, presence on the LRU counts as a reference,
serialisation is via pagemap_lru_lock.

One would think so, but that doesn't really change anything.
I agree the locking and reffing in there is really nasty.  It 
doesn't help that I put four, repeat four bugs in the 20-line
__page_cache_release().  __pagevec_release() is, I think, OK.
It would be much simpler to grab the lock each time
page_cache_release() is executed, but our performance targets
for 2.5 preclude that.
The page->pte.chain != NULL problems predate the locking changes.
We haven't found that one yet.
