Subject: [PATCH 1/1] mspec driver: tighten Kconfig dependencies
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/7/12

The mspec driver needs bte_copy (a sn-specific function) as well as some
functions of the uncached page allocator, but these dependencies are not
reflected in Kconfig which leads to compile errors with certain
configurations.
