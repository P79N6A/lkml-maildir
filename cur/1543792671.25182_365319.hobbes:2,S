Not necessarily true with regard to having the functionality in the 
kernel, but for Linux, probably better for maintenance based on the social
issues.  I have MDB fully integrated in the kernel and I don't have all 
these problems.  It's just an update to the kdb hooks, patch, build and go.
Novell should probably just fork the kernel and start their own distro 
and dump the mainstream Linux.  They have the people and infrastructure
to support drivers and do just as good a job as LKML with the old 
NetWare group.  Novell was presented with MDB two years ago and opted
to build their own rather than go with ours.  I have been disappointed 
with the quality of what they have produced to date.
They should fork form Linux and understand that the Linux folks and 
their culture is totaly alien to Novell's culture.   They will never make
progress with the Linux folks and continued interactions will waste both 
groups time.  They have the talent and resources to preempt Linux
and do their own thing.  They need to just go and do it.
