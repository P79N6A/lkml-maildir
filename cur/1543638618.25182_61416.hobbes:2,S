That's a policy/optimization issue; it's not even desirable to shrink the 
caches with priorities proportional to their size---they would all tend to 
become equally large.
The patch shrinks all the caches equally often, with the same priorities. The 
caches can then decide themselves how they will react, depending on their 
cache size and entry size, replacement strategy, taking care of page entry 
clustering or not, etc.
The icache, dcache, and dqcache are shrunk using the same strategy (except the 
priority is a constant for some of the caches, which could be coded in the 
shrink function as well). This scheme has worked out pretty well so far, 
right?
For Extended Attributes we are currently using a very simple cache with LRU 
entry replacement, and small entries. The cache doesn't grow very big, 
either.
Regards,
Andreas.
