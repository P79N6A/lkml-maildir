a structure's members are in a separate namespace, so you can avoid using
a prefix string all over the place.  Also, you can use the same name as
the documentation does (some hardware manufacturers like repeating the
obvious prefix string in some of the register name, so you'd end up with
FOO_FOO_XMIT vs FOO_RCV).  Some people also like to use upper case for
macros, which doesn't work with mixed-caps register names.
structs are nice for repeated patterns in the MMIO space.

One of the points against structs for offsets is that some day, someone
will be too smart for their own good and do
#define write(x,p) switch(sizeof *p) { \
case 4: writel(x,p); break; \
case 2: writew(x,p); break; \
case 1: writeb(x,p); break; \
}
but that it can be abused isn't an argument against using it, is it ?
