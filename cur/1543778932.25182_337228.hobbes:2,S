Oh yes, very much so.  L2 is an out of order cache and it can only queue
limited amount of store operations.  With the number of stores for switch
stack structure, it will easily exceed that hardware limit.

I don't have exact breakdown to how much contribute from prefetch the outgoing
process versus incoming process.  But I believe both contributes to perf.
gain.
