Subject: USB keyboard driver buggy, repeats keys

I bought a USB keyboard recently, and I am a fast typist.
When I type "incoming" in a hurry, I press i, then n, then c, and
then I release i, then n, then c.  When I do this, Linux registers these
keystrokes:
  incin
I first thought this is a bug in my keyboard, so I tried the same thing
on Windows -- I get "inc", just as expected.
Please fix!
Felix
