The fact that the remaining architectures haven't bothered implementing
kprobe supposed should not be used as an argument for pushing something
inferior out of laziness.
It's the same with syscalls, the kernel infrastructure is there, but if
you don't bother updating the syscall tables and wrap it in with glibc,
then the call isn't available on your architecture.
The core kprobe infrastructure is available to all architectures, it's
up to the developers of the remaining architectures to implement the
remaining bits.
