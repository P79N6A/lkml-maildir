Agreed, you still have to write a kernel driver to handle the pci
probe/disconnect functions and the pci id stuff to use the uio core
properly.  That's not in question here at all and please don't think
that uio even attempts to handle this, as that is not what it's job is.
Think of uio as just a "class" of driver, like input or v4l.  It's still
up to the driver writer to provide a proper bus interface to the
hardware (pci, usb, etc.) in order for the device to work at all.
