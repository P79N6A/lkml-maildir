The "continuous" nature of drive addressing means that the kernel
can do a fine job seek-wise. Due to write caches and read track
buffers, rotational scheduling (which could be done if we knew
geometry) would provide too little gain for the complexity. I would
say that for most workloads you wouldn't see any difference. (IMO)

The benefit I see is knowing the seek time itself (not geometry), which
can be used to tune the IO scheduler. This is something that I'll
probably need to do (in kernel) in order to get my IO scheduler in 2.6,
as it probably (not tested yet) has bad failure cases on high seek time
devices like CDROMs.

I'm not sure that this is among SCSI's big advantages. I know some
SCSI disks have farness/starvation problems with big reorder windows.

It is worth looking into I think. I will be testing something like it
for AS but in kernel not userspace. I don't think it would be very
useful to help basic head movement optimization, but I would like
someone else to prove me wrong.
