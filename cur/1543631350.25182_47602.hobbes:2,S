That assumes you want to page out the page table only after the pages it
references are paged out. There is no reason I can see for not flushing it
first. Its very cheap to regenerate for non-anonymous pages - much cheaper
than the pages it references. Also the locality of most apps means that
there are zillions of glibc pages they reference only once (for init, and
for linker fixups/names)
