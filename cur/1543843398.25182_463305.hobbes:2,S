And that's actually a problem for those who maintain such dynamic
trace points.

Bzzt, wrong. This is your own personal experience with tracing. Marked
up code does not need to be active under all build conditions. In
fact trace points can be inactive by default at all times, except
when you choose to build them in.
And as I said elsewhere, the fact that your use of instrumentation is
solely for debugging ("i only add them when i need them for a given bug"),
I repeat that there are mortals out there that need this for their
applications.

Sorry, orthogonal is the word.

I have, and I've showed you that you're wrong. The only reason you can
make this argument is that you view these things from the point of view
of what use they are for you as a kernel developer and I will repeat
what I've said for years now: static instrumentation of the kernel
isn't meant to be useful for kernel developers. While it may indeed
be in some cases, in most cases it's likely useless, as you've been
very successfully arguing in this thread. Nevertheless there are very
legitimate uses for standardized instrumentation points.

Thank you, I couldn't have put it better. This paragraph, more than
any other snippet I've seen to date, clearly demonstrates why
tracing is such a contentious issue. Kernel developers use tracing
during their normal development process, and of course their gut
reaction is: why the hell would anybody need this for mainline? But
of course this misses the entire point. Kernel tracing for developers
is but a corner case of kernel tracing in general. There are very valid
and legitimate reasons for userspace to be able to obtain important
events. And of course any infrastructure developed with that in
mind should also be usable by kernel developers.
