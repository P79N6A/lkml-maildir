Hi everybody!
I am using Apache web server on Linux Red Hat 5.0.I want to restrict access to
certain sites.I tried adding the URL of the site thr the GUI Apachi
Administrator window but whatever changes I am making it is not saving at all.
Secondly if I want to do this by editing httpd.conf or proxy.conf file what
statement I should add in order to restrict the site access for the people
behind proxy.
Vijay.
