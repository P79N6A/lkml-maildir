Subject: Keyboard dead on bootup on -test6.

Since I switched to test6, my stuck-key problems went away.  (Thank you.  Good 
work.  Judging by the repeat speed, it's back to using hardware repeat.)
However, a problem I'd seen before resurfaced.  Sometimes when I boot up the 
keyboard is completely dead.  It just did this to me (had to use the power 
button, because of course ctrl-alt-del did nothing), and I compared the boot 
logs:
This is what it looks like when it works normally:
Sep 30 16:18:28 localhost kernel: serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
Sep 30 16:18:28 localhost kernel: input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on 
isa0060/serio0
Sep 30 16:18:28 localhost kernel: serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
This was the failure:
Sep 30 16:17:31 localhost kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (raw set 0, 
code 0xfc, data 0xfc, on isa0060/serio1).
Sep 30 16:17:31 localhost kernel: serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
Sep 30 16:17:31 localhost kernel: serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
Under -test5, that failure would have left me with a stuck key endlessly 
repeating (and an otherwise dead keyboard).  Now at least the stuck key part 
has gone away, but the keyboard is still dead until I power cycle the 
machine.
I continue to be using a thinkpad iSeries, I believe it's a 1200C...
