There is no reason Summit or es7000 or any other subarchitecture 
would need to do different  virtualization. In fact these subarchitectures 
are pretty much obsolete by the generic subarchitecture and could be fully
done by runtime switching.
I don't disagree with your general point that some kind of PAL
code between kernels and hypervisors might be a good idea
(in fact I think Xen already uses vsyscall pages in some cases for this),
but this particular example is no good.

I hope not. The i386 subarchitecture setup is pretty bad already
and mostly obsolete for modern systems.

Possible.

I don't think that will happen in the way you imagine. I certainly
don't plan to ever merge legacy stuff like Voyager or Visual Workstation
or even 586 multiprocessor support.
It might be that x86-64 grows 32bit support at some point, but certainly
only for modern systems and without the heavyweight subarchitecture setup
that i386 uses.

No, one of the strong points of the x86-64 port is that APIC/IO-APIC support
doesn't carry all the legacy i386 has to carry.

I don't fully agree to move everything into paravirt ops. IMHO
it should be only done for stuff which is performance critical
or cannot be virtualized.
For most other stuff a Hypervisor can always trap or not bother.

I have my doubts paravirt ops will ever support any of this @)
If we tried that then it would be so messy that it would turn into
a bad idea.

And it's unlikely PCI will be ever a good fit for a Quantum computer @)

For 2.6.19 it's too late already. Freeze for its merge 
window has already nearly begun and this stuff is not ready yet.

The problem with VMI is that while it allows hypervisor side evolution
it doesn't really allow Linux side evolution with its fixed spec.
But having it a bit isolated is probably ok.
