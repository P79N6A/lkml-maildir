That would have been my first inclination, but Andrew actually
wanted to be able to keep a pI with bits not in the capability
bounding set.  And it's really not a big problem, since
	1. you can never grow cap_bset
	2. the capbound.c program just makes sure to call capset
	   to take the bit being removed from cap_bset out of
	   pI'
	3. It could be advantageous for some daemon to keep a bit
	   in pI which can never be gained through fP but can be
	   gained by a child through (fI&pI).
Does that seem reasonable to you?
(On the one hand man 7 capabilities shows cap_bset affecting
fP and not pP', on the other hand we're definately getting into
the territory where we'll have to rewrite the manpages anyway)
