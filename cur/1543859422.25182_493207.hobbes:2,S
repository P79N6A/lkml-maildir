The little Microsoft flag sticker that was on my Dell Latitude got
replaced with a sticker that has a Tux and 'linux inside' on it. :)

This is a can of worms, and then some.  For instance, let's consider this
Latitude.  *THIS* one has an NVidia Quadro NVS 110M in it.  However, that's
not the default graphics card on a Latitude D820.  So what number do you
put in?  Do you use:
a) the *default* graphics card
b) the one *I* have with the open-source driver
c) the same one, but with the NVidia binary driver?
(Remember that "users" have different criteria than "developers" - most
users would consider this entire thread "intellectual wanking", especially
since the patch that spawned it got withdrawn.  And 'Frames Per Second'
trumps that stupid little 'P' in the oops message.  Failure to understand
this mindset guarantees that your computation of a "friendliness rating"
is yet more intellectual wanking... ;)
Similar issues are involved with the wireless card - the Intel 3945 I
have isn't the default.  Repeat for several different disk options, and
at least 4 or 5 different CD/ROM/DVD options.  Add in the fact that Dell
often changes suppliers for disk and CD/DVD drives, and you have a nightmare
coming...
And then there's stuff on this machine that are *not* options, but don't
matter to me.  I see an 'O2 Micro' Firewire in the 'lspci' output.  I have
no idea how well it works.  I don't care what it contributes to the score.
On the other hand, somebody who uses external Firewire disk enclosures may
be *very* concerned about it, but not care in the slightest about the wireless
card.
Bonus points for figuring out what to do with systems that have some chip
that's a supported XYZ driver, but wired up behind a squirrely bridge with
some totally bizarre IRQ allocation, so you end up with something that's
visible on lspci but not actually *usable* in any real sense of the term...
