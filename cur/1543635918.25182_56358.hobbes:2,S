Strange: According to the Intel docs (24919923.pdf and 25072104.pdf) as of
June 2002, all P4-Ms have models have model "2" and mask "4", and none have
model "1" and mask "2". What does /proc/cpuinfo say? And are you really sure
it is a speedstep-capable P4-M?
I'm really doubtful of that, as the MSR_EBC_FREQUENCY_ID didn't change a bit
while trying speedstep transitions:

Obviously, this value is bogus, what's the correct CPU frequency of your
notebook?

How old is it? Fresh-out-of-the-factory? Then there might, just might be
some update to the P4 specifications not yet included in the documentation.
And please send me a /proc/cpuinfo, just to make sure. And, BTW, have you
tried ACPI and its "performance state" interface?
