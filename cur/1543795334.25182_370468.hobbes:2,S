When I try to run "smartctl -a /dev/sdb" it tells me that "Device does
not support SMART". /dev/sdb is a normal hdd in an external firewire
enclosure. To me this looks like the firewire SCSI layer does not
support the passthru of the S.M.A.R.T. commands. Or is there any other
way to query the S.M.A.R.T. status of an hdd attached via Firewire?
Thanks,
Bernd.
