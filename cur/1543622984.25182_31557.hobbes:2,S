Subject: linux-2.5.6-pre2 IDE broken for Via vt82c596b chipset

	I see that there have been some changes to drivers/ide.
I have not completely tracked this problem down yet, but here goes.
When I try to boot linux-2.5.6-pre2 and load the ide-mod.o module,
I get:
VP_IDE: VIA vt82c596b (rev 12) IDE UDMA66 controller on pci
: dma_base is invalid (0x0000)
ide0: Bus-Master DMA was diabled by BIOS
	No IDE devices are detected (using devfs, /dev/ide/ exists
but is empty).  The other machine that I tried this on is also a
vt82c596b (rev 23), and behaves the same way.  Linux-2.5.3 seems
to work fine, however.
