I'm guessing these threads?

Let me see if I can summarize:
* There is concern about how much is bloat, where do we draw the line 
for in-kernel
* There is concern about duplicating user space utilities.  We moved 
the kernel broken md assemble instead of getting the current one from 
mdadm, and that should be part of mdadm package.
* There is concern that distros won't want to use this anyways -- They 
need more features and use a bigger library than klibc provides.
* Let me propose one:  Even with kinit in the kernel, users will still 
be broken because they will use there existing external initramfs.  
This means we can't move stuff like opening /dev/console to kinit.
* Some distributions are already using klibc and have been.  They see 
the reason to merge is to have the canonical api with the kernel to 
avoid version mismatch.
Ok, now let me make a radical proposal:
1_  Create the utilities in klibc distribution.
2.  A new Kbuild (Makefile) variable, features-y, declares what initrd 
features are required because they were removed from the kernel but 
configured.
3.  Create a file containing the feature list of the initrd.  Maybe a 
directory of files so we don't get overwrite problems.
4.  Have the build system parse the built-in initramfs, extract the 
feature file(s), and fail if it does not contain the magic strings 
required as defined by the Makefiles.
5.  Require features being removed have the user space tested and 
checked into a release of the kinit distribution before merging the 
removal.
Distros would just create a feature file claiming what their initrd 
loaded initramfs build script will create and point 
CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE to include that.  The whole initramfs doesn't 
have to be put in the kernel, just the feature files.
Yes, i said kinit distribution.   While it needs to build against 
klibc, it may or may not be part of that package.

I guess this would be a statement on maintaining kinit / klibc 
development.

The Kconfig variables for klibc have no help.
Was the Kbuild documetation updated to mention $(klibc)= ?
