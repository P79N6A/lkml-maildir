Nope the BIOS region is allocated as BUSY, at least as it comes
out of the E820 map.
From arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:legacy_init_iomem_resources
....
		res -> start = e820.map[i].addr;
		res -> end = res->start + e820.map[i].size - 1;
		res -> flags = IORESOURCE_MEM | IORESOURCE_BUSY;
		request_resource(&iomem_resource, res);
