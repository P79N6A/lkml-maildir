Strange return value, that.
It happens because vfs_permission() sees CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE
and returns "yes" on a file which has no `x' bits set.
Then open_exec() falls through to deny_write_access() which
sees that the file is open for writing.
If the file is _not_ open for writing then the "WTF" test in
prepare_binprm() is what stops us from executing the file.  So
the test there is definitely needed.
Moving the "WTF" test into open_exec() definitely fixes things
up, but I think the real bug is in vfs_permission().
