I also have an AHA1505 and a nameless CD-R. I recently posted a bug
report about 2.2.3-ac1 hanging when trying
   dd if=/dev/scd0 of=raw.iso
With any data CD. Could you try this also to see if you get a panic
as well. This would rule out problems with sg and cdrecord.
The kernel panic happens without fail, and I'm currently going back
through older kernels to see when the fault was introduced.

I could still use sysrq to sync the disk, so perhaps this isn't the
same problem, but it can't hurt to check.

I agree with this.
