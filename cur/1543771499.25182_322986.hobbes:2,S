Just wondering, is there any reason why the patch mentioned in the 
following post has not been implemented (as of kernel 2.6.11.11 it is 
not)? Is it a matter of testing? Is there a better alternative to solve 
the problem described in the thread?

The current behavior (unchanged from that described in the post above) can 
be problematic, for example when I want to do stateful firewalling on my 
linux router.  I've been applying the patch therein to recent kernels and 
it seems to be doing the right thing (sends redirects only when the 
redirect target is on the same subnet as the sending host).
Any thoughts?
TIA
