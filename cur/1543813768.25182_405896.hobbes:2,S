Alas, I've included all the dmesg's.  
Below is the script that I use to enter S3 sleep.  It unloads rid of
troublesome modules and stop services that don't sleep well.  Then
(for debugging) it sends the kernel version and boot parameters across
the serial console (the @@@@ SLEEP line), raises the debug level to
0x1F, does a sync (in case the sleep hangs, since this is my
production machine), and then enters mem sleep.
So nothing in it should trigger any thermal methods; except that I
usually have the THM2 trip point raised to 45C with a polling time of
100 seconds.  So once in a while a thermal poll will happen sleep is
being set up.  I am not sure whether it would be reported in the
dmesgs if it happened; but the S3 failure happens much more often than
such a thermal polling would happen, so I doubt the S3 failure
requires a thermal poll.
