   Or do I add /dev/oprofile/sizeof or whatever ?
That would be a great way to do this portably.
I suspect oprofile won't be the only situation where this value
would be useful, perhaps /proc/sys/kernel/pointer_size?
If you use sizeof(void *) as the initialization value in the kernel
code that implements this read-only sysctl, it will "just work".
