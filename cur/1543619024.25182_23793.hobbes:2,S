Since I'm using a 2.4.17 (upgrade from a 2.2.16), I get this
message:
Dead loop on virtual device tun1, fix it urgently!
Sometimes it's there a short time between them, other times a
long time.
I got no idea what's causing them.
I tried looking at the source and it says something about
recursion and something about SMP.  This is not an SMP box.
The device in question is a tunnel device, it does ipv6 over
ipv4.  Most traffic goes thru that one.  It's the only one that
generates that message.
It says to fix it urgently, but I don't know how, and it seems to
work fine otherwise.
Do you know what is wrong and how I can fix this?
Kurt
