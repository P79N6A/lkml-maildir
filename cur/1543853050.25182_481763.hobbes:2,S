This is correct behaviour. The resource addresses are implied resources.

That is correct, the implied resources end up in the tree as they should

This is an ugly hack that is done by the libata code to deal with old v
new IDE handling. All is still correct however

ata_pci_init_one should have followed the legacy_mode path at this point,
and the legacy mode path should not be trying to request the legacy
regions the quirk code already reserved.
I suspect the code should only do the pci_request_regions() call if the
device on if (!legacy_mode), and the legacy code should
pci_request_region(pdev, 4, ...);
