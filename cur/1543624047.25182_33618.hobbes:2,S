Subject: [patch] Missing module for ISDN / AVM PCMCIA card
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Dear Kernel developers,
when using the stock 2.4.x kernel on RedHat 7.x, the
device
http://www.avm.de/en/products/hardware/FRITZ_Card/FRITZ_Card_PCMCIA/index.html
does not work, because of a missing module (avma1_cs). However, it works
with RedHat's kernel.
You can look at
  
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50999
for a discussion, that led to the inclusion of the missing patch in the
RedHat kernel.
When I apply the patch posted at:
  ========================>
  
http://uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0103.1/att-0957/01-avmdiff
  <========================
into any 2.4.x kernel (including 2.4.18), the card immediately works on my
Dell Laptop.
Could you please consider including this patch in the standard kernel?
The patch was attached to a message available at:
  
http://uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0103.1/0957.html
I think, this patch is based on a work described at:
  
http://www.wimmer-net.de/avm-pcmcia/
(looks outdated, patches there did not help me)
Cheers,
Kai
(Please note that Red Hat seems to have modified that patch a little, the
file included in their kernel 2.4.9-31 has 3 lines changed. Let me know if you
want me to send you their file, I can't judge whether their changes are
needed for 2.4.18. They also moved the file to drivers/isdn/hisax/avma1_cs.c,
while the above patch places it at drivers/isdn/pcmcia/avma1_cs.c.)
