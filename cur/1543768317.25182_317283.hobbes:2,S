Yes, there are a ton of these. There are also a ton of files that use 
spaces instead of tabs, and a ton of files that use spaces between 
function name and opening parenthesis - like  foo (arg);  or even 
 foo ( arg ) ;
Just because there are lost of them doesn't (in my oppinion) mean that 
they shouldn't be cleaned up. Reading code that doesn't adhere to 
CodingStyle is annoying at best, and hides bugs at worst.
There's no way I'm going to clean it all up - especially not if you don't 
want the patches, but I think it *ought* to be cleaned up, and if you 
should change your mind then I'm willing to clean up at least a fair bit 
of it.
