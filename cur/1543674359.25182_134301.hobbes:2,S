Or possibly..
It looks to me that the store_edid function is unconditionally calling
the READ EDID function without first having called the installation
check function. (Int 10h ax=4f15 bx=0)
Ralf Brown's interrupt list (which is pretty much definitive afaik)
also notes that for the READ EDID function, dx should be 0, we are
using 1. Is there a reason for this ?
