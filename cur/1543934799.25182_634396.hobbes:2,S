Tried it on my pile of patches here.
ERROR: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#33: FILE: scripts/basic/docproc.c:61:
+FILELINE * docsection;
Legitimate error.
And a bunch of > 80 chars WARNINGS.
The warnings I ignore because I prefer readability on my 22" widescreen
but the ERROR should never had hit me.
But thats me that does not adhere to CodingStyle and checkpatch is correct.

Disagree. This is about a distributed model where the individual
submitters shall make life as easy as possible for the maintainer.
And the maintainer shall not be distracted by imporlerly formatted source
code that looks wird. It simple does not scale.
And no tool will help here because first review happens at the diff level
before applying any patch to any code base and the diff has thus never
seen a tool on the maintainer side.

Several reasons why it has accelerated:
1) Ingo cares about checkpatch compliance
2) Ingo accepts patches fixing checkpatch compliance
3) We have a codebase that has lower quality than we usually praise us to have
I think it is fine to fix style issue when we do some major surgery in a file,
like unification.
But starting to randomly attack files all over the kernel is IMO to overdue it
and this is happening at the moment. And only carefull reviewing prevents bugs.
