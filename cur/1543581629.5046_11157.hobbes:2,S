Ack...
First, I'm glad I wasn't hallucinating, and that the mail did indeed get
seen by someone.
Second, instead of reverting, can't we simply move those two lines up a
bit:
        case IPC_RMID:
                if (current->euid == shp->u.shm_perm.uid ||
                    current->euid == shp->u.shm_perm.cuid ||
                    capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)) {
                        shp->u.shm_perm.mode |= SHM_DEST;
+                       /* Do not find it any more */
+                       shp->shm_perm.key = IPC_PRIVATE;
                        if (shp->u.shm_nattch <= 0)
                                killseg (id);
                        break;
This way, we're not violating specs, programs work, *and* we're not
touching freshly kfree()d storage?
