Hi there !
I am rather new to the list, so I don't know whether this has already been
posted. I am using an IOMEGA ZIP drive which is attached at the parallel
port. Using the automount option I can easily cd /misc/zip. From the logs
I can see ppa module being loaded as it should be. When mount has expired
and the ppa module gets removed from the kernel it is not loaded
automatically by kernel any more by another mount attempt. This seems to
be specific for the ppa module, since other modules like bttv, es1370
behave all right. Any ideas ?
If you cannot reproduce this or need more information, please let me know.
