Hello all,
  Here is my latest.
Steps
O) Fix sound support.
         Add the following line to 
/usr/src/linux-2.5.X/linux-2.5.33/sound/core/device.c
         #include <asm-generic/errno-base.h>
O) The following file needed to be copied (a quick hack)
      Luckly the lower end alphas have the same chipsets as pc's
        cd include/asm-alpha
        cp ../asm-i386/kmap_types.h  .
O) Argument list changed to do_fork add another zero. The uid is in
      a register someplace but I'm not sure which one....
      FILE: arch/alpha/kernel/process.c
       add a last argument of zero to the 2 calls to do_fork
O) ptrace needs to include sched.h
      FILE:  include/linux/ptrace.h  Line: 27
      add  >> #include <linux/sched.h>
O) The CIA chipset has a type in the file... sigh...
     FILE:  arch/alpha/kernel/core_cia.c
     Line:232
     Line:261
     change
        mase = 0x18;
     to
        mask = 0x18;
O) Delete the following lines from the top of :
      NOTE: This is a synthetic file so the compile must fail to fix it.
      FILE: arch/alpha/vmlinux.lds.s
# 1 "vmlinux.lds.S"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command line>"
# 1 "vmlinux.lds.S"
# 1 "/usr/src/linux-2.5.X/linux-2.5.33/include/linux/config.h" 1
# 1 "/usr/src/linux-2.5.X/linux-2.5.33/include/linux/autoconf.h" 1
# 5 "/usr/src/linux-2.5.X/linux-2.5.33/include/linux/config.h" 2
# 2 "vmlinux.lds.S" 2
Okay. I will try a rebbot tomorrow. I also want to try to compile the 
modules. sigh.
just everyone know I run a pure redhat rawhide. therefore.. here are my 
packages..
gcc-3.2-4.src.rpm
glibc-2.2.90-26.src.rpm
binutils-2.13.90.0.2-2.src.rpm
If these numbers don't scare you.....
