Exactly. For now I don't really need it, but decided to
try it just in case I'll need it later. I stuffed
udhcp and nfs tools into initrd, played with it a bit,
and finally managed to make it work under 2.4.25.
Then I tried 2.6.3 with the _same_ initrd and same
bootloader.
2.6.3 refuses to recognize my initrd as root fs.
It even mounts it on / but then suddenly acts
as if I specified root=/dev/nfs. I _didn't_.
I said root=/dev/ram, then tried root=/dev/ram0,
root=/dev/ram/0, root=/dev/rd/0.
All to no avail:
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem)  <-- mounts initrd on /
Mounted devfs on /dev
(here 2.4.25 would say "Freed unused kernel mem..." and happily exec init)
Root-NFS: No NFS server available, giving up
VFS: Unable to mount root fs via NFS, t
