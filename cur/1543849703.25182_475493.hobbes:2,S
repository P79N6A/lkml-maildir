OK I have to write an RFC for various fs developers, so I'll be sure
to include you.
We want to be able to pass in a short (possibly zero) commit_write
length if the page data can not be fully copied.
generic_cont_expand seems to be using that as a shorthand for
"update the i_size but don't mark anything uptdoate"? If so, I think
it would be nice to fix it. Why does it even need to go through the
prepare/commit? Why not make __generic_cont_expand a standalone
function, and call that from cont_prepare_write?
