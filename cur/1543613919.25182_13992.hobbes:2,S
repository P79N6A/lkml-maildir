Damn straights
sendfile(2) had an oppertunity to be a real extention of the Unix philosophy. 
If it was called something like "copy" (to match "read" and "write"), and 
worked on all fds (even if it didn't do zerocopy, it should still just work), 
it'd fit in a lot more nicely than even BSD sockets. Alas, as it is, it's 
more of a wart than an extention. 
Now, sys_readahead() is pretty much the stupidest thing I've ever heard. If 
we had a copy(2) syscall, we could do the same thing by: copy(sourcefile, 
/dev/null, count). I don't think sys_readahead() even qualifies as a wart.
