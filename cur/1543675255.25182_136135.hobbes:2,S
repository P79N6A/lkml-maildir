Can you define what you mean by big vs small? I presume you mean RSS?
There are several factors that come into play here, at least:
1. RSS (and which bits of this lie on which node)
2. CPU utilisation of the task
3. Task duration
4. Cache warmth
5. the current balance situation.
I'm not convinced there's anything we can do about 3, since it's mostly
unpredicatable, and I don't have crystal_ball.o ... we can kind of predict
2, at least for running tasks (not sure it makes much sense over fork).
For 1, we can kind of use that over a fork, though as we have no idea
whether it'll exec or not, I'm not sure it's much use *unless* we're
cloning.

Turning on child-runs-first would instinctively be good as well, though
I have no benchmarks to prove it ... would be nice to get the load
balance situation fixed asap by running the exec. That's not on right
now, IIRC.
