Just a few points probably worth considering for the press release:
* Most of them feature a quote/interview from some authority, saying stuff
like "We are tremendously excited about this new release ... this will
enable us to leverage the amazing capabilities of Linux in a competitive
business like ours..."
Really stupid things that are really worth mentioning:
* Euro support?
* Y2K compliance
Regarding the look: I *think* that bullet points are not usual in press
releases. Better rephrase it as regular flowing text.
Keep it short.
Then there's a problem of the URL to give.
