Hi,
whenever I try to copy a file from mu usb flash disk ( which has fat32 fas on 
it ) . I got the following error in syslog :
May 23 01:13:23 localhost kernel: FAT: Filesystem panic (dev sda1)
May 23 01:13:23 localhost kernel:     fat_get_cluster: invalid cluster chain 
(i_pos 652)
Looks like fat support is broken or am I missing something?
Regards,
/ismail
