I'm sorry, but by pointing to the POSIX timer stuff, you're just making 
your argument weaker.
POSIX timers are a horrible crock and over-designed to be a union of 
everything that has ever been done. Nasty. We had tons of bugs in the 
original setup because they were so damn nasty.
I'd rather look at just about *anything* else for good design than from 
some of the abortions that are posix-timers.
