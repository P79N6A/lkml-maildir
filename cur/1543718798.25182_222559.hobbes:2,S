Which machine dies?  The pilot or the Linux box?

So we ran out of memory?  Not good.

It uses it's own buffers from what I remember.

Expected, not all of the usb-serial drivers have to do the same thing,
as they operate on very different types of hardware.

Reusing the buffer and urb is _slow_.  The visor driver creates a new
buffer for every call to write.  It is entirely possible that you can
starve the kernel of memory by sending it the output of a raw device
node, as that data comes faster than the USB data can be sent.
But this is a different problem from the one you originally set out to
fix, how about sending a new patch for the treo disconnect problem, and
then we can work on the next issues.
