That's absolutely not true.
Let's unravel the code, by fixing usage of 'x' (which seems to vary at will 
between value and pointer in the above example), and by replacing printf with 
another opaque function. Our decls:
	void foo(const int *ptr);
	void bar(int val);
You're saying that this:
	foo(&x);
	bar(x);
can be reordered into this:
	bar(x);
	foo(&x);
No way. First, the way that const is currently defined, the compiler cannot 
assume that the value of x did not change while foo was executing. So, it 
will not only be forced to leave the two functions in that order, it will 
even reload the value of x before passing it into bar. Go figure.
Second, even if const did have stronger semantics that forbade the value of x 
from being modified during execution of foo, the compiler still could not 
reorder the two function calls, before it cannot assume that the two 
functions (in their internal implementations) do not touch some other, 
unknown to this code, global variable.
