Not everything which can be expressed in ELF is supported.  You don't
want to load something, you want to reserve address space.  And you want
it allocated in a certain way.  The ELF loader is no generic ELF
interpreter.
Now, if the only problem is the overcommit and making the do_brk() call
allocate the memory as read-only a change to the do_brk() interface
might be acceptable (well, ask somebody doing mm hacking).  I wouldn't
be entirely sure whether read-only pages alone are enough.  This does
not open any new holes as far as I can see.
I'd say experiment with it and add a flags parameter which is the right
combination of VM_READ | VM_WRITE | VM_EXEC.  All calls but the one in
binfmt_elf.c should pass all read bits, the one in binfmt_elf can
respect the binaries flags.  You must be sure, though, that the last
page of the data area (i.e., writable area) in a regular binary is not
mapped read-only.
