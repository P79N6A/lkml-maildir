I was in single user mode so it shouldn't have been changed
from it's default value.  But it might have been.

Right.  That looks to be why I couldn't see my debug information.
There was definentily something hosed at the kernel level
that shouldn't have been.  We should be very careful before
we move 2.4.14-pre8 to 2.4.14.  Hopefully I/someone can find a way
to reproduce a lockup and track it down.

That is good to know thanks.
