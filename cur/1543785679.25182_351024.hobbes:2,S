I guess the /etc/mtab is more trustable. But, you not anymore speaking
about hardware detection here... I think that everything which is beyond
hardware detection is purely magic and shouldn't be trusted because for
one type of detection if it fit few users, it won't fit many.
And anyway, in the case you are considering, make oldconfig is probably
the one to use.
