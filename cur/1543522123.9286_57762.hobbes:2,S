   On the list, some time ago, I've seen patches to serial.c that were
   adding support for serials on ISA PnP boards. I consider them good.  Now
   when I look into the 2.3.40 kernel, I don't see them. Were they ditched,
   or they are just making their way into the kernel slowly?
They're on my TODO queue.  There are a couple of minor issues having to
do with IRQ allocation that are still up in the air.  I'll be sending a
complete patch to Linus to update the serial driver shortly.
