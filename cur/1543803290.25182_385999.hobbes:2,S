This is as I understand it:
With 2.6.15 on x86-64:
	If available, alternate timesources (HPET, ACPI PM) will be used if
available on AMD SMP systems. (clock= is i386 only)
With 2.6.15 on i386:
	If CONFIG_X86_PM_TIMER is enabled, and available it is the preferred
clocksource over the TSC.  Some distros have changed this priority
causing the TSC to be preferred. In these cases clock=pmtmr is needed.
How's that?
