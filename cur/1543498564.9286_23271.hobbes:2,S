Oh yes I can:
I will not compress it at modem-driver level (I'll not let modems
negotiate compression), and then I'll take care to transfer only
compressed data around the link. (You mostly transfer compressed files
via ftp, can easily add -C option to scp/ssh, web might be problem.)
Compression at this level is more effective than compression at
modem-level because you can use much more powerful algoritms and
because you have right context.
Look at 
http://linmodem.org/
 for other things doable with such modem
interface.
You are right that non-linux <-> linux connections are in majority,
but I've seen few linux<->linux connections already. And: starting
with DSP and adding compression/error correction later will let you
gradualy improve your code.
