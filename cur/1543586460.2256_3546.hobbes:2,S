iBCS has been ported and maintained against most of 2.3.x series for a
long time. And it is still, of course, available under 2.4.x, It is now
called ABI because old name iBCS was a misnomer (iBCS2 is an Intel
standard but the Linux implementation is far beyond the bounds of IA32
architecture -- it is portable, flexible and, in one word, perfect :)
