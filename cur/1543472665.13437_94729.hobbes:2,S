Hello,
When I was unzipping large file from fat partition to ext2 
partition I got this oops. The partition to which I unzipped the file 
didn't unmount in shutdown. I've have had the same kind of oopses with 
linus's 2.1.131 (no problems w/ 2.0.36) If you got something please 
CC it to my email address.
