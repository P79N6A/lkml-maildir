p4-clockmod offer only the possibility to throtte the cpu (and therefore
you can get a kind of frequency setting when you change the duty cycle),
but it do not scale voltage for the processor, whereas speedstep-ich will
offer you the possibility to scale voltage and frequency by changing
directly the core multiplier.
In fact, if you have at least power control for the processor via ACPI
(look into /proc/acpi/processor/????/power), and your machine support
at least the power state C2, and if you are using the p4-clockmod,
or anything that do throttle the processor, you reduce the windows time
when the processor can enter at least this C2 power state, and this may
actually consume *more* power than you would expect, especially if the
system is mostly idle.
