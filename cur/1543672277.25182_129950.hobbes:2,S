*argh* I hate this. Earlier I only tried to disable acpi, I had to
disable MPS1.4 in the BIOS as well. Now it works. But, I can't turn my
computer off without acpi. This worked with 2.5.68, so something has
changed, but I guess you aren't the one to blame, then. 
Thanks for answering, and sorry I didn't find this out earlier. But it
works with acpi in 2.5.68, that's what's bugging me :)
Best regards,

A little off-topic rant about my motherboard:
I have a ASUS CUV266-DLS motherboard. Dual P3, integrated SCSI and
ethernet. Since it is smp, I have to use ACPI to power it off.
* With kernel 2.5.69, and ACPI enabled, usb doesn't work. 
* With earlier ACPI enabled kernels, and secondary ide disabled in bios,
usb doesn't work.
* Without ACPI, no kernel will boot with secondary ide enabled.
It's not easy..
