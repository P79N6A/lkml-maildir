Remember, you're not the only linux user in the world. :-)
If everybody with trouble complain, then they get enough complaints
that it matters.  It doesn't work if everybody thinks the're alone
and do nothing.  Note that linux is the fastest growing OS these days.
You can also let them know before you purchase.  When getting your next
machine, consider one that claims linux support.  They exist - even
laptops.  And if you get something else, let them know.  If you
inquire about a machine - ask about linux support.  Salesmen getting
a lot of that will take note.  The linux market isn't the biggest 
but cutting off 5%/10% of the market for no reason is bad business.
Linux support is easy - they don't have to do support, just sell
a box that works.
Bring a knoppix CD when looking at machines in shops - then you
can verify that they work without obvious snags like that mtrr bug.

About how to complain - be constructive.  Tell them that the problem is 
serious and makes the machine work much slower than the competition, 
but that it is easily fixable by setting the mtrr's up right in the bios.
You may also want to tell them that several other vendor have had
this problem - and fixed it by issuing a bios upgrade.
