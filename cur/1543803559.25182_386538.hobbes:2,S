Subject: Userspace interface breakage in power/state

In older kernels, power/state for PCI devices took a PCI power state as 
an argument and so "3" was an entirely sensible thing to echo into it. 
In current kernels, it hits a BUG() in pci_choose_state and things blow 
up.
While I realise that the former interface was broken and wrong, would it 
be possible to move to a new one without breaking existing code?
