Hi Roman,
one thing that easily leads to errors is that the difference between
e.g. bool and define_bool is less obvious than before (it's no longer
explicitely stated). If there's no string behind the bool and no
"prompt" line it's now treated as define_bool. I've already found two
places in sound/oss/Kconfig where this was missing accidentially. Could
you add explicite define_* back to the config language and let the
program quit with an error if there's e.g. a define_bool with a string
or prompt line or a bool without a string or prompt line?
I know this requiress a conversion of several Kconfig files but
considering that this might prevent some confusion in the future I think
it's worth it.
TIA
Adrian
