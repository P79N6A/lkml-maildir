Not all the CPUs in cpu_map need to have an entry in 
sched_group_phys_bycpu[]. sched_group_phys_bycpu[] is purely used to
"remember" the chunk of memory we allocated for sched_group array
for later freeing. Individual CPU's in cpu_map point to a suitable entry 
in the sched_group array (thr' their phys_domains structure), as in the 
following lines of code after memory allocation:
	sd = &per_cpu(phys_domains, i);
	...
	sd->groups = &sched_group_phys[group];
Hope this clarifies!
