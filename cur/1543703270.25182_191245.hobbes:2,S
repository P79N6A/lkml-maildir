When I looked at the ia64 code that uses insert_resource (and I admit I am
reading between the lines a little) it seems to come along after potentially
allocating some resources behind some kind of bridge and then realize a bridge
is there.
Which is totally something different from this case where we just want
to ignore the BIOS, because we know better.  I have seen a number of
boxes that reserver the area where apics or ioapics live.  So I think
we need an IORESOURCE_TENTATIVE thing.  This is the third flavor of
thing that has shown up, lately.
Want me to code up a patch?
Eric
