OK, here are my bonnie test results.  They are not what I expected -
read and write performance is significantly better with 16KB max request
size, while seeking is much better with 1024KB.
jackd was running in the background in both cases.  With 1024KB, there
were massive XRUNS, and worse, occasionally the soundcard interrupt was
completely lost for tens of milliseconds.  This is what I would expect 
if huge SG lists are being built in hardirq context.  With 16KB, jackd
ran perfectly, the highest latency I was was about 100 usecs.
Kernel is 2.6.8-rc2 + voluntary-preempt-I4.  CPU is 600Mhz, 512MB RAM.
