Thanks. It turned out, it was me having missed to .config enable
	"Enhanced Real Time Clock Support"
. Sorry for having bothered you about this.
hwclock then couldn't open /dev/rtc, fell back to iopl(3) hw access.
And that failed sometimes ;-)
I'd still like to know, why are there the do_page_fault() SysRq+T
traces under hwclock context, while hwclock userspace is in a loop
doing iopl(3)ed io-access? 
hwclock's loop active then is:
	for (i = 0; !cmos_clock_busy(); i++)
		if (i >= 10000000)
			return 1;
with:
	int cmos_clock_busy()
	{
		return   /* poll bit 7 (UIP) of Control Register A */
	    (hclock_read(10) & 0x80);
	}
with hand interpreted:
	unsigned long hclock_read(unsigned long reg)
	{
		unsigned long v;
		__asm__ volatile ("cli");
		outb (reg, clock_ctl_addr);
		 v = inb (clock_data_addr);
		__asm__ volatile ("sti");
		return v;
	}
I guess:
SysRq+T doesn't care about userspace eip and just displays hwclock's
last used kernel stack?
