As long as you try for example measure (?) .. not.

DTrace real examples shows something completly diffret.
MANY things (if not ~almost all) can be kept only in aggregated form 
during experiments.

Try measure number of dysk I/O operation without touching storage for 
store raw data. What you need ? only one counter (few bytes) instead of huge 
amount of memeory for buffer and store logs. Try measure something like
scheduler with possible small system distruption.
