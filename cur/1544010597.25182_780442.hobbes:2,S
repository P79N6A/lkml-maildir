In a >normal< system one usually does not use raw sockets. So if a root 
process do use raw socket, at least netfilter sends a notification and 
there's a chance that someone take notice it by checking the kernel logs.
Yes, if the machine is compromized then the logs can be tampered, if 
netfilter is compiled as a module, the module can be replaced by another 
one, and so on. A careful cracker can take care of all the alarms, trip 
wires. But should we remove them due to nuisances on >test< systems?
Rather make it a kernel compile option but do not remove.
Best regards,
Jozsef
