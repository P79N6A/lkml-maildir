2.6.25-rc1-git1 if you are using IDE.
however it may still have this problem
	if (ireason == 0) {
		write = 1;
		xferfunc = HWIF(drive)->atapi_output_bytes;
	} else if (ireason == 2 || (ireason == 1 &&
		   (blk_fs_request(rq) || blk_pc_request(rq)))) {
we problably need to call ide_cd_check_ireason() also for REQ_TYPE_ATA_PC
requests and remove (blk_fs_request(rq) || blk_pc_request(rq) here
		write = 0;
		xferfunc = HWIF(drive)->atapi_input_bytes;
	} else {
		printk(KERN_ERR "%s: %s: The drive "
				"appears confused (ireason = 0x%02x). "
				"Trying to recover by ending request.\n",
				drive->name, __FUNCTION__, ireason);
		goto end_request;
	}
