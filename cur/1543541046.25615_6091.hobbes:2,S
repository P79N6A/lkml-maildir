You won't get any argument from me on that one. I had a bit of a light
shouting match with the supposed 'manager for open source products' at Intel
on this subject last year:
He:	"You have to sign an NDA to get techical info"
Me:	"Fine. That's understandable. However, all you
	 need tell then is which information you *don't*
	 want made public (e.g., "XXXX feature we'd like
	 to not see out there"). But a basic functioning
	 driver will be open source."
He:	"I'll have to get back to you on that."
<<session times out>>
	
If I hadn't had a client that had wanted me to specifically do the Intel board
(and release it to *BSD- way to go, Traakan!) I certainly wouldn't have
bothered, although, as I said, I like the chip's programming model.
Netgear is supposed to be very supportive with SDK's.
