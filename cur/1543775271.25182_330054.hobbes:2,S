Well, my observation is that they differ. Well, up to kernel 2.6.13-rc1.
This latest kernel shows the same behaviour that -mm showed, unfortunately.

Now *this* made things work! I have put another dmesg log on my homepage at
http://www.ime.usp.br/~rbrito/bug/
 (see the 3rd-try log). This made things
work and I could mount the device.
I had to disable hotplug and udev, since trying to unload the Firewire
modules made my machine hang (I think that it was trying to unload ohci1394
that made my machine hang).
So, does this ring any bell? Can I provide extra information?
I am keeping the following diff just for reference's sake:
