lockdep detects and warns about those.
I think we're about equally skeptical about this; I'm extremely hesitant
about any place in the kernel that uses rwsems for anything other than a
performance tweak. I've ended up with a mental model of rwsems that
basically comes down to "you need to be able to replace it with a mutex
without breaking correctness". Now of course that model is somewhat of
an oversimplification, but not by that much...
