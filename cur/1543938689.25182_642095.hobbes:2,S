No, that would not be useful at all as it's redundant as you point out. The
only reason to add it is if the Opteron box can figure out the CPU-to-node
affinity. Right now everything gets dumped into node 0 where as x86_64
can figure it out properly.

:| The patches applied so far are about increasing test coverage, not SRAT
messing. While there are still breakages for some boxen, more configurations
should work on more machines than previously. Those using non-NUMA .configs
should not notice the difference.
