I've been able to distribute IRQ servicing to other processors on P4 
Xeon HT systems as described in the IRQ-affinity.txt file in the 
kernel-source Documentation directory. Well, it shows up as doing so in 
/proc/interrupts anyway! Looks like CPUs 0, 2, 4, etc.. are the real 
processors and 1,3,5, etc.. are the logical processors (which do not 
handle interrupts).
