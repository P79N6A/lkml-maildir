Overhead? Doubtful. Also, that requires the use of list_del_init()
while dequeueing, which is not in place now. Please do back the claim
with measurements. It should be easy enough to nop out set_task_queued(),
implement task_queued() via !list_empty(), and clear_task_queued() via
INIT_LIST_HEAD() for a quick performance comparison. But I'd say to
merge it even if there's no difference, as it's more self-contained.
