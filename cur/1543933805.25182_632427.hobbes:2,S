Whatever security /home has, /var/home is the one that restricts because 
users can still access their files that way.

Pffuff.  That's what volume managers are for!  You do have (at least) 
two independent spindles in your RAID1 array, which give you less need 
to worry about head-stack contention.  You probably want different mount 
restrictions on /home than /var, so you really must use separate 
filesystems.  LVM is your friend.
But with regards to bind mounts and hard links:  If you want to be able 
to hard-link /home/me/log to /var/tmp/my-log, then I see nothing to 
prevent hard-linking /var/home/me/log to /var/tmp/my-log.
I think it's possible to be too precious about preserving the illusion 
of one file-system structure when the reality is something different.  
Don't lose site of reality.
