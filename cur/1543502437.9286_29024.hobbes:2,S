As things are right now you can't do this or you'll end up with the same
security problem as for example SUID scripts on SunOS 4 had.
To make things work as you want them a filedescriptor to the SUID script
would have to be passed to the interpreter by binfmt_skript and every
interpreter would have to be changed to take advantage of that.  Otherwise
there is a security hole ...
