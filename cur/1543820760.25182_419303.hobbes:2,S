Maybe we should have a script which processes kernel's include/linux/*
files and produces sanitized set of headers (by deleting
"#ifdef __KERNEL__" blocks, etc), which will be treated at
*the* official kernel<->userspace API and will be used by glibc etc?
Such "kernel header sanitizator" script is to be maintained
and distributed as part of kernel tree.
glibc people will then know where to look/what part of kernel to patch
if they will stumble on incorrect sanitized header. I.e., they will need
to either fix original kernel header so that translation of it becomes ok
(for example, a missing #ifdef __KERNEL) or by modifying
sanitizator script.
