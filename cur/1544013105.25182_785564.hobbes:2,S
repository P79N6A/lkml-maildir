Well the problem currently is that there is no driver for these features.
There has been a request for this functionality for a long time but both
the primary drivers for this (Dave Chinner and I) are no longer with the
company for which we started the project. I'd be glad to continue this
if there would be an interest by the filesystem developers.
The key problem that would have to be addressed to move this
forward is to clean up the callbacks for dentries and inodes.
Again the problem solved by these patches are mainly filesystem intensive
loads that can cause significant fragmentation for inodes and denties
which may leave lots of memory unrecoverable for other purposes.
