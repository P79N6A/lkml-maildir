You must be seeing something I don't. Andrea was objecting to how Larry 
was practically declaring defeat for the "bk haters", how you're defining 
this as whining I don't know.

Miles already mentioned that you're wrong here and I don't really know 
what you expect here from him.

No disagreement here, but that wasn't really point I was trying to make.

Your analogy is flawed, nobody cares what you are using privately, but 
your decisions as kernel maintainer have an effect on other people, may 
this be the patches you include in the next release or the tools you 
distribute them with.
In the end it's your decision what tools you use, if you think the 
advantages outweigh the license which goes contrary to the open 
devolopment process, that's fine, but so have other people the right to 
disagree with that decision. Maybe you could make some suggestion on how 
to articulate this more politically correct?
Linus, what disturbs me here is that I don't see that you don't even try 
to acknowledge that the bk license might be part of problem, you don't 
mention the bk license with a single word. Nobody hates bk, that's a myth 
I'd expect from Larry but not from you. bk is a rather innocent and 
certainly useful tool, the annoying part are the business practices of its 
owner, who tries to push a licence into an environment, where it has to 
provoke rejection.
bye, Roman
