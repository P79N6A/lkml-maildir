I've been hacking through a similar issue on some Dell laptops.
You need to add entries to the atkbd_set2_keycode[] array in
drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.h.  Look at the #defines in
inlucde/linux/input.h for stuff that matches the keys that
five the unknown key printk()s, and put those values in the
Nth entry of the array, where N is the scancode reported in
the printk().  
Eg, if the first key mentioned above were a VolumeUp key, you
would want to add the value 115 to the 0xb2'th entry in the
array.
Once you do that, you can run xev(1x) to see what X keycode they
get, look in xkb/keycodes/xfree86 for the symbol associated with
each keycode, and in xkb/symbols/* for something that associates
that xkb symbol with an X11 keysym.
