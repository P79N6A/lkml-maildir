But you add extra code for that on top of what we have, and are also
prevented from making per-cpu assumptions.
And you can get N CPUs per runqueue behaviour by having them in a domain
with no restrictions on idle balancing. So where does your increased
flexibilty come from?

I don't know about that -- the current load balancer already minimises
the nasty multi threading effects. SMT is very important for IBM's chips
for example, and they've never had any problem with that side of it
since it was introduced and bugs ironed out (at least, none that I've
heard).
