Eventually it could well make sense to do that, e.g., the radix tree 
eventually ought to evolve into a btree of extents (probably).  But making 
things so complex in the first version, thus losing much of the incremental 
development advantage, would not be smart.  With a single size of page per 
address_space,  changes to the radix tree code are limited to a couple of 
lines, for example.
But perhaps you'd like to supply some examples where more than one size of 
page in the same address space really matters?

Indeed, that is important.  Good night, see you tomorrow.
