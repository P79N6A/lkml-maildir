Desktop is FC4 gnome-desktop-2.10.0-5. I don't think I have
 anything fancy in it, apart from the mini-icons on the top panel
 which include oldies (Evolution, Mozilla) and actually used
 stuff (Firefox, gnome-terminal, Thunderbird, Gaim, and the
 volume control).

Will try. Note however, when I experience the problem X doesn't
 really "hang" - it spins in CPU.

Will also build no-preempt kernels in the near future.

For that matter, I'm running it now without issues... it
 seems to get in the weird state only on startup.
