Yuck!  I take it back!
The res_send.c code in glibc2.1.1 (and all prior versions, inc 2.0.x) 
resolv library looks fundamentally broken for any threaded environments.
There are gaping, wide-open race conditions.
The kernel is fine (I've hammered it all sorts of ways and can't produce
the same lockup with poll/recvmesg or select/recvmesg), it looks like
libresolv is the problem.
