And what about people who don't already know of the list and have a bug to 
report or a patch to submit? The first place people will look for a (list) 
address is the MAINTAINERS file.
I'd sugest that instead of removing the entry just add a note that the 
list requires subscription to post.  And on many lists that don't allow 
unsubscribed people to post the post can often still make it to the list 
via moderator aproval, so the address is still good for unsubscribed 
people.
Either leave it as it is or add a note would be my suggestion.
