Streaming IO has a very small footprint, essentially just the readahead,
so this has more to do with IO scheduling than paging.  VM just has to
take care not to completely close down the readahead window or throw
away readahead before it gets used.  No theoretical problem here, just a
small matter of coding ;-)
