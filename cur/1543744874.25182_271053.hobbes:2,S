I have a P3-500 box /384 MB ram and 2 scsi disks (sda and sdb).
OS is on sda and test partions is on sdb
aic7xxx driver 
Using anticipatory schedulor with a tag_depth of 4 (this is set via
modules.conf)
options aic7xxx aic7xxx=global_tag_depth:4
/dev/sdb1 is created with ext3 and htree is enabled. Mounted as /htree
synctest obtained from here (synctest tries to simulate an MTA
behaviour)

I run the following commands on both 2.6.9 and 2.6.10-rc2
/usr/bin/time -p ./synctest -fu -t 100 -p1 -n1 /htree/nfsexport
timing results
