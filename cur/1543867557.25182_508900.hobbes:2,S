Question to the world here:  Distros make, as a matter of course, a 
series of modifications to the Linux Kernel so that their modules or 
features work.  What stops VJ making a patchset which effectively 
s/EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL/EXPORT_SYMBOL/g 's the kernel source then 
distributing that under the GPL?  He then supplies his un-GPL'd modules 
to the world which just happen to only run on the modified kernel.  I've 
read the GPL of course (IANAL though) and I can't see what this violates 
except the /spirit/ of the license.  Don't get me wrong, I'm strongly 
against anyone doing what I just mentioned, I believe it to be immoral 
taking someone's GPL'd code and mangling it in such a way.  I speak as 
an embedded developer myself whose company decided that running our code 
under Linux and distributing our code under the GPL was far preferable 
to running closed-source software on a closed-source platform.
I'll finish off to VJ:  If you want to be alarmed, go ahead and switch 
to VxWorks, the Linux community will live on.  It might have a smaller 
user-base in embedded-land but that's the nature of the beast.  A large 
user-base doesn't mean much to something like linux unless it comes with 
a large, open-source-minded developer-base.
