Subject: [Patch](memory hotplug) __GFP_NOWARN is better for __kmalloc_section_memmap()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello.
This patch adds __GFP_NOWARN flag to calling of __alloc_pages()
in __kmalloc_section_memmap(). It can reduce noisy failure message.
In ia64, section size is 1 GB, this means that order 8 pages are necessary
for each section's memmap. It is often very hard requirement under
heavy memory pressure as you know. So, __alloc_pages() gives up allocation
and shows many noisy stack traces which means no page for each sections.
(Current my environment shows 32 times of stack trace....)
But, __kmalloc_section_memmap() calls vmalloc() after failure of
it, and it can succeed allocation of memmap. So, its stack trace
warning becomes just noisy. I suppose it shouldn't be shown.
This patch is for 2.6.19-rc2. And I tested this patch on PrimeQuest
with high memory pressure environment.
Please apply.
