Jes,
Hey how's Itanium been lately?
As was mentioned before, there are nonproprietary compilers around as
well that might be good choices. My point is that the ANSI C steering
committee is probably a more balanced forum to determine C syntax than
the gcc team. We should adopt c99 syntax where feasible, for example. I
am not asking anyone to use a proprietary compiler of they do not choose
to do so.
