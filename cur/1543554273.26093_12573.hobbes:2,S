Dick, have you tried a simple "strace -f -p <pid>" ?
This often gives enough info.
BTW, there's one version of sendmail that tests the
capability security hole of a previous kernel version
(2.2.15 ?), and refuses to launch if it discovers it.
It may be possible that sendmail does other tests like
this one.
Regards,
Willy
