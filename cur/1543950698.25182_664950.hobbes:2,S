Uncool, I am going to try and find a machine to reproduce this one but
in case I have no luck, can you try setting the following in your
.config which may rattle out something please?
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=y
CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM=y
and as you have DEBUG_INFO, can you say what line is ffffffff8027b693 ?

My initial guess was that is is something to do with page_table_lock but as
you didn't get to fault in huge pages, it doesn't make much sense.
