Sure it can. But I thought that as the VXEXT1.0 filesystem is per 
definition not a vfat filesystem it might be better to have it separated 
and not drill it into the IMHO anyway overly mixed up vfat/fat code 
already in the linux kernel tree. Even if that means that some parts in 
the code of the vxext filesystem are probably equal to the msdos 
implementation, please note that large parts which were not needed by 
the vxext implementation was dropped by me for clarifications.
So I still hope that my implementation is going to be considered for a 
future kernel tree integration as it may be quite usefull for embeeded 
systems wanting to access VxWorks partitions.
cheers,
jens
