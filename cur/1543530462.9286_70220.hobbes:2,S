   Well, it might even be useful to be able to catch it. Example: 'X' gets
a SIGNMEM. It responds by freeing any memory it might be using for bitmap
caches, font glyph caches, anything unnecessary. When it returns from the
signal, the system then has enough memory free to fulfill the request and
continue the program. 'X' may have also set a flag somewhere when it
caught this signal to tell itself at the first opportunity to shut down
and print "low memory: aborting" if this was a desired behaviour. Better
than a crash huh?
   Overall an excellent suggestion I think.
