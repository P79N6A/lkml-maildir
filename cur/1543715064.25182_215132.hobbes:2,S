Just about every time we've cared to investigate slab alignment, we've
ended up removing SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN.  It seems inappropriate that _any_ of
the inode caches have this set, for example.
And this patch appears to have taken the effective size of the buffer_head
from 48 bytes up to 64, which hurts.
So I do think that we should either make "align=0" translate to "pack them
densely" or do the big sweep across all kmem_cache_create() callsites.
If the latter, while we're there, let's remove SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN where it
isn't obviously appropriate.  I'd imagine that being able to fit more inodes
into memory is a net win over the occasional sharing effect, for example.
