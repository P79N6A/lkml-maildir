Thanks for identifying that.

This is a different case from any I've seen reported before: we've seen
several "mapcount:1 count:0" reports, but here you have "mapcount:1 count:1"
which is evidence plus confirmation that the page is really in use.
Yet prep_new_page is being called while (re!)allocating this page that's
already in use.  Sounds like a disagreement between page counts and the
buddy system.  But the most obvious cause of that, misuse of a high-order
page by freeing a lower-order page from within it, should hit the BUG_ON
in put_page_testzero before ever getting this far.
So, sorry, I've no idea.

You've edited out the full stacktrace for brevity; and were probably
quite right to do so, the state of this page is not likely to have
anything to do with the process it's now being allocated to.

And this is just a consequence of bad_page resetting mapcount from 1 to 0
(well, from 0 to -1 if you delve into how those counts are implemented):
just further confirmation that the reallocated page was really in use.

Both that patch and memtest86 are good responses,
though I doubt my patch will actually help us much in your case.

DRM again, hmm, thanks, yes, useful info.

Your worthiness is manifest, in all you've said, and left unsaid.
All I can say for now is, please let us know if you get more such traces.
Thanks,
Hugh
