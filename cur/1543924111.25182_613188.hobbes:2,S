So there is no problem with allowing modal flags to be passed to 
set_mempolicy() because glibc will respect the mode actual and pass it 
right along to the kernel.  That gives the power to the programmer to 
specify whether he or she, based on the updated documentation, wants the 
nodemask to be interpreted in terms of the system or cpuset.
