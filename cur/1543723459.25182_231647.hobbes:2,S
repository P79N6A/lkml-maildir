Well, reiserfs_panic is supposed to crash with BUG().
And the reason for the reiserfs_panic call seems to be on-disk corruption
in your case.

This is fine.

This line looks this way in current bk tree:
  panic ("REISERFS: panic (device %s): %s\n",
         sb ? kdevname(sb->s_dev) : "sb == 0", error_buf);
And I think it was like this for some significant time already.
bk diffs output suggest that this change was in there since Feb 4th, 2002.
Are you using vanilla tree?
I seem to remember that bdevname was used early in 2.5.
Bye,
