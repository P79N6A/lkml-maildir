Not quite, AFAIK.  Existing code was a fscking mess of subtly incompatible
implementations; the thing that had helped was simple - the people who
would have to implement the damn thing had a lot of presense in the
committee.  So it boiled down to
	* observation: attempt to describe it as text transformation leads
to horrors; it really acts on token stream; give up treating it like a text
filter.
	* after figuring out what it should do to sequences of tokens they
ended up with a reasonably simple algorithm that matched the existing
behaviour sans the nasty corner cases everyone handled differently.
	* _that_ had been turned into spec.
