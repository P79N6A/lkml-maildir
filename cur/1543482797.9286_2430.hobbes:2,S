A couple of hardware companies have started to actually design things for
WNT thus giving the three words ``designed for windows'' more meaning than
just advertisment.  For some hardware this means that the requirement of
64kb pages was loosenend to 4kb pages.  So ``Designed for Windows'' may
actually even mean something positive for the non-windows world at times.
This probably also implies that NT also has some trouble with large pages ...
