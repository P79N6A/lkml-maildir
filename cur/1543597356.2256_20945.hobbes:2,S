mmm, i have also one Athlon (my workstation) with the same MB and
everything works with AThlon optimizzations and 3dnow enabled...
When i got an oops it was because i configured the bios to erogate just
1.7 volt to the processor instead of default 1.75 volts (too hot here,
with 31 degrees it is difficoult to keep cold a processor like this).
I think that FSB speed is the key, at less for some of the VIA chipset. I
have there an Athlon 1300
Mhz with 13x100 setting and FSB of 200 Mhz.
Are you using a processor with 266 Mhz FSB?
(All 266 Mhz FSB Athlon I administer are running on AMD chipset).
