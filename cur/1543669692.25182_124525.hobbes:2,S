I should have been more clear.
What I actually mean is:
disk is in the bus/loop/etc, powered on, ready to be enumerated.
The user then tells the OS "please insert the disk"  This is the request 
which starts the clock.
The point where a device entry is in /dev ready to be used stops the clock.

An insert operation would block until the following sequence occurs:
insert a disk, disk added to subsystem (scsi, etc), hotplug event, 
hotplug handler creates device node.
Without blocking until the device is created and ready to be used, it 
becomes difficult to actually "hotswap insert" and then immediatly use 
the device, requiring polling.  Most users would like to wait for the 
event to complete, or have a select()able fd to wait on to know when the 
event has been completed.
This might be possible to emulate through dnotify, but would still 
require a rescan of the dev directory, causing poor performance.
