hi, 
I've installed the debian(woody) on my Dell dimension 3000 computer.
But I can't make the network adapter work, it's type is intel pro/100
VE network desktop adapter. I've tired such modules as eepro100,
eexpress, but it doesn't work.
Any suggestion or information are welcomed?
Thanks in advance.
