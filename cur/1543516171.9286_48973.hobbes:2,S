Subject: 2.3.28: chopped command_line[] = corrupted zeropage? (i386)

Hi,
In 2.3.28 (on my machine) I expect to see a command_line[] like this:
command_line=<BOOT_IMAGE=l rw root=200 console=ttyS1,9600 console=tty0 load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=1>
and instead I see this (a printk() in start_kernel())
start_kernel(): command_line=<BOOT_IMAGE=l rw root=200 console=ttyS1,9600 console=tty0 load_ramdisk=>
so, this is why I had troubles with ramdisk earlier. Now, who is the 
likely candidate of corrupting my command_line, or more likely PARAM 
which is empty_zero_page?
I suppose some debugging in setup.S is in order...
regards,
Tigran.
