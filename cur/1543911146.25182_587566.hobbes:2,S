My intention is that we have 3 possible schemes for kernel to use boot
information.
1. Use "linked list" only. Then if booted with old bootloader which uses
"zero page" protocol, the "zero page" information provided by bootloader
should be converted to "linked list" for other part of kernel to use.
2. Use "zero page" only. Then if booted with new bootloader which
provides "linked list" but not "zero page", the "linked list"
information provided by bootloader should be converted to "zero page"
for other part of kernel to use.
3. Use "zero page" + "linked list". Then if booted with old bootloader,
the "linked list" is empty. If booted with new bootloader, both the
"zero page" and "linked list" are used.
We need to choose one from schemes above.
- The scheme 1 appears the most clean one.
- The scheme 2 has 4k "zero page" constraint, so it is not good.
- The scheme 3 is easiest to be implemented.
Personally, I prefer the scheme 1. But the scheme 3 is OK too.
