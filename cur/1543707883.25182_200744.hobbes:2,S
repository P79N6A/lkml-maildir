Hi.  The whole error message is (when building 2.6.3-bk3):
drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.c: In function `sbp2_alloc_device':
drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.c:734: error: `host' undeclared (first use in this
function)
drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.c:734: error: (Each undeclared identifier is
reported only once
drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.c:734: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [drivers/ieee1394] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
It gives the same message when building with the source from the 1394
subversion tree.  Apparently the declaration for 'host' is not where it
used to be. 
#ifdef CONFIG_IEEE1394_SBP2_PHYS_DMA
                /* Handle data movement if physical dma is not
                 * enabled/supportedon host controller */
                hpsb_register_addrspace(&sbp2_highlevel, host,
&sbp2_physdma_ops,
                                        0x0ULL, 0xfffffffcULL);
#endif
**--------------------------------------------------------------
highlevel.c (which isn't #included in sbp2.c) lists:
struct hl_host_info {
        struct list_head list;
        struct hpsb_host *host;
        size_t size;
        unsigned long key;
        void *data;
};
**(highlevel.h is #included in sbp2.c, highlevel.c isn't, and 
highlevel.h doesn't mention struct hl_host_info).

** The above information is intended merely for recreational value
   and may provide no practical information with respect to 
   resolving the problem as I have never been accused of being a
   systems programmer!  :)
If you need more info, please mail me as I'm not on the list.  TIA,
Bob
