Hi kernel hackers.
(Sorry for my bad english)
I have a single Pentium II, 96 MB of ram and 2.2.0-pre9-kernel compiled
with pgcc 1.1.1. I was compiling glibc-2.0.111 tests under X and
suddently the pgcc freezed. It ate 0% of CPU, it wasn´t a zombie,
but i couldn´t kill it even with kill -9. Then i killed make and it
helped, but gcc still left in the process list. I tried to compile the
tests again and it get stuck right after pgcc was started. After that i
tried to close X but my machine freezed totally and i couldn´t use even
SysRq-keys. This is all what I found in /var/log/messages:
