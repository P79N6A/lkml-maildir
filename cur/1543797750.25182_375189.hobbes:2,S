Overall it looks very nice, you basically all of it right. And thanks
for doing it btw, it's a good addition to the documentation. A few small
comments follows:

The unit here should just read 'sectors', blocks usually refers to a
file system block.

Both correct, good!

These standard 512-b blocks we just call sectors in Linux.

A little confusing - it's the number of in flight io at the
driver/device end, that is after the block layer. One could read the
above as total in flight (total queued in the queue for the device),
which is a very different number.
