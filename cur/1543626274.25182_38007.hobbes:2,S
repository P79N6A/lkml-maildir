All these other fellows are OK.
However,
the list should include also
Al Gore.
	Among other things he is a visionary who will fight till the end 
for our rights from the highest possible elevation.
Bill Gates.
	If we only had him as a leader money will be flowing like a river 
towards OSS and GNU. For starters this entire list will be subscription 
based with required certification (about $10K per person and $3K if you 
only want to read it)
Larry Ellison.
	He will promote linux/gnu/oss by putting a few big logos on his own 
space shuttle.
Thanks for this opportunity.
Hristo Doichev
