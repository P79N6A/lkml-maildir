Its much harder for me not to propogate stuff to one specific driver.
I'd much rather you simply ignored the new driver if this is a problem
then resync when ready.

Your best bet is probably to look at the diff between 2.4.19 and
2.4.20pre8-ac in terms of changes to the drivers themselves. The file
moving means you want to diff the two by hand but the changes should be
clear enough. If not drop me a note
