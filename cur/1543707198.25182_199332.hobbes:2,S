There are still two problems with the radeonfb on my IBM X31:
1) The screen is garbled when the fb kicks in at boot - its not 
converting the text from the VGA console correctly. I have a photo of 
this here: 
http://emergence.uk.net/radeonfb_corruption.jpeg
2) If I run X and then exit X or switch to a fb vt then the bottom line 
doesn't clear when scrolling and running `clear` only clears the middle 
line of pixels on each line of text.
