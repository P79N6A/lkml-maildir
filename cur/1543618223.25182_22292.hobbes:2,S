Subject: 2.4.17: Hang after IDE detection

Hello,
I recently got an older k6-2/333 with a SiS chipset and tried to install
linux on it.
Every recent distro I tryed with a 2.4.x kernel would hang after detecting
the SiS5513 controller.
Annoyed I took 2.4.17 compiled it on another machine. The IDE config was:
#
# ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL support
#
CONFIG_IDE=y
#
# IDE, ATA and ATAPI Block devices
#
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK=y
CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI=y
CONFIG_IDEPCI_SHARE_IRQ=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ADMA=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX=y
CONFIG_PIIX_TUNING=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SIS5513=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_MODES=y
It would hang exactly the same as the distros (written down from display
by hand):
Blah blah blah...
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33mhz etc etc
SIS5513: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 09
PCI: Assigned IRQ 14 for device 00:01.1
SIS5513: chipset revision 208
SIS5513: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later

    ide1: BM-DMA at 0x4008-0x400f, BIOS settings hdc:pio, hdb:pio
hda: ST34321A, ATA DISK drive
hdc: CD-540E, ATAPI CD/DVD-DROM drive

ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on ira 15
<hang>
Keyboard is dead (no num-lock, no magic sysrq)
Things I have tryed and failed:
- Not using dma by default in kernel or nodma option
- Not enabling support for SiS5513 in kernel
- specifing hda geometry (hda=...), hdc=cdrom, hdb,hdd=noprobe
- kernels 2.4.11pre5 and redhat 7.1, Mandrake 8.0, 8.1 boot disks
- Andre's latest patches for 2.4.17 with SiS5513 configured
Things that succeeded:
- 2.2.x kernels were fine (x=10, 16 that were handy)
- 2.4.0test1-ac22 was also fine (tested without SiS5513 configured...)
- Andre's letest patches without SiS5513 configured
The /proc/pci of the machine after booting 2.4.17+Andre+no-SIS5513
injected into the Mandrake 8.1 bootdisk (again by hand):
PCI devices found:
   Bus 0, device 0, function 0:
       Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 5597 [SiS5582]

         Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe0000000 [0xe3ffffff].
Thanks for any help guys...
(now off to convince that Mandrake distro to install...)
