Right, but the kernel also wants to use cache hot pages for other
things, and it also frees back its own cache hot pages into the
allocator.
The fact that sysbench is a good candidate for this but does not
show any improvements is telling... if the workload does not reuse
the page RSN, or if it is reclaiming them, we could actually see
regressions.

With MADV_FREE, you don't need to zero the memory, but the page
is uninitialised. So you need to initialise it *somehow* (ie. use
either a zeroing alloc, or initialise it with application specific
data). At that point, you have to touch the cachelines anyway, so
the extra zeroing is going to cost very little (and you can see
that single threaded performance isn't improved).
