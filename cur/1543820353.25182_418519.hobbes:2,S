To be honest, I don't know if 0x40000 is used or not.  It isn't in the
e2fsprogs version of ext2_fs.h.

Hmm, maybe I don't understand the GFS2 issue then?  Why not just use
IFLAG_JDATA on the directory and remove the use of IFLAG_INHERITJDATA
(equivalent) entirely from GFS2?  Does the implementation depend on a
distinction between these on a directory?
