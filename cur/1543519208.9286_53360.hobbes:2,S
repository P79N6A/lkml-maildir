Every 2.2.x kernel that I've downloaded has compiled without
trouble whatsoever.  I originally downloaded 2.2.0, and have
patched with the bz2 patches ever since.  I've not had any
trouble whatsoever, and I've been using a more or less stock
RedHat 6.0 system for a compilation environment.
With 2.3.x I've also had no trouble compiling anything, except
where there have been widespread problems with something and it
is well known.  A simple small patch is usually released very
shortly after such a problem arises.
If anyone consistently has problems with compiling, and those
problems are well and beyond the widely known problems that get
discovered quickly after each release, then they should strongly
question their environment.  I'll bet that they are not using the
recommended tools for compilation.
These problems occur only with devel kernels, and possibly on
very rare occasions with stable ones.  Saying that these
compilation problems puts things in the distributors hands is
rediculous.  I've NEVER seen ANY distribution release a dist with
a development kernel.  (That is speaking of the mainstream widely
used dists like RedHat, Caldera, etc - MAIN RELEASES - not beta
releases).
If Caldera's tools can't compile a kernel, then apply their
errata, or use RedHat or some other dist.
The linux kernel is never going to be held hostage by anyone in
the manner you suggest/imply.
In my experience, the inability of a kernel to compile (if not
widely known as a devel bug in a devel tree that many people
experience), is usually the result of improper tools, outdated
tools (see Changelog), major changes like the page/buffer cache
stuff that broke the FS's, etc..., or bad hardware.
I don't do barely any kernel devel right now, but I obtain,
compile every devel kernel, and usually without a hitch.
When you vary from the advertised tool chain however, problems
can and do creep up quickly.
Good luck tracking the problem down!
