Makes sense, I will.

In fact it already works like this, since device_suspend() now calls the entire
device_resume() on error.

However, I think we don't need to wait with unregistering suspended devices
until after the other ones are resumed.  We only need a special function for
unregistering suspended devices that will make the PM core release the device's
semaphore before unregistering it.
I have already sent a replacemet for
gregkh-driver-pm-acquire-device-locks-prior-to-suspending.patch that includes
some code from the $subject patch and implements the above idea:

I'm going to merge it with your patch at:
https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/linux-pm/2007-December/015921.html
and with patches [2/4] and [4/4] from the $subject series.  I'll post the
result for a review later today.
Thanks,
Rafael
