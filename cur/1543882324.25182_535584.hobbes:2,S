Yeah, that was my bad it is a RTL8169SC, and the 
problem was intermittent
sometimes is cause a panic othertimes it didn't.
It is laptop that does not have a serial port and 
I could not couldn't
get  the
kernel to boot using a usb serial port so I 
couldn't get a screen capture of
the intermittant panic.
