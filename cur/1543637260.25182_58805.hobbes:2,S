it already /is/ such a symlink.  The /usr/include/asm, though...
Oh, fucking great, /usr/include/asm /isn't/ a symlink to 
/usr/src/linux/include/asm, it's its own directory.
( can we say self-inconsistency? )
Interestingly, NONE of these ( listed ) files exist in either location
( one being the stock-kernel-sources and the other being Caldera's ( though 
possibly I scrambled something over the past year ) /usr/include/asm 
?DIRECTORY ( rather than symlink ) ).
Perhaps if it works-for-you then you've got the files in your 
/usr/include/asm directory since they aren't in the stock kernel?

the closest match in /usr/src/linux/include/asm-i386 is
timex.h
