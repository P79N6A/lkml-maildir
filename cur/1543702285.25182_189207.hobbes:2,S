This is also the easiest solution to implement for the sn2 platform.
Honestly, I haven't used any PCI-X chipsets (nor do I know of any) that
exploit this new relaxed ordering feature, so I'm only guessing at how
it might be usefully exported to the driver API.
The sn2 platform actually _always_ behaves as though relaxed ordering
were enabled, so all we really need to implement this correctly is a
read_relaxed(), which will be a read() but without the software
workaround we put in place to conform to the PCI PIO/DMA semantics.
Maybe we can just add read_relaxed() for now and deal with other
chipsets that allow relaxed ordering as they appear?
Thanks,
Jesse
