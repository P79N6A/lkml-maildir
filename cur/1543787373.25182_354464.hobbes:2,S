SAS is ultimately SCSI.  I'll just have to write my own SCSI core.
_We_ together can do this in parallel to the old SCSI Core.
This is the whole idea.

You see, at my age and my situation, I no longer see this as
"my balls - your balls".  What matters to me is good design,
quality code, customer satisfaction, bottom line.
E.g. I'm quite a liberal person and I wouldn't block
or stop new technologes from going into Linux on the basis
and merit of my not understanidn that particular new technology.
The bottom line is not "my balls - your balls" but the wide
spread use of Linux and "storage OS of choice".  Not "hobbyist
OS of choice" and not "let me play Robin Hood".

Yep, I've been saying this since 2002.  On the linux-scsi ML.

And this is the problem: *you* and "the community" see things in
*this* way:  "your balls - my balls", "yours/mine".
While I see things like this: new technology, absolve, use, move on.
As to your comment above, it's not about how *I* see things.
It's about how things _actually_ *are*:

Turn the table around: can _I_ pose this question to JB and Christoph?
(since they are the ones who think this of SAM/SPC)

Me neither.
