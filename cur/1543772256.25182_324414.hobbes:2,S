Actually looking at the bnx2.c code from jeffG 2.6.13 git tree, it seems 
that it also tests for MSIs being delivered.
So both tg3 and bnx2 test for MSI correctness.
My original comment when submitting the patch, was under the assumption 
that these tests were not being done. However that code has got added to 
both drivers.
