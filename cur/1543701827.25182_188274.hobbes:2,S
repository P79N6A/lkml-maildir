Hmm.. I can see (a) (except for the fact that pretty  much all unixes have 
mount-flags to say "no device files") but I don't see why you'd _ever_ 
expect (b) to be true.
It's patently not true for such rather traditional unix devices as pty's, 
for example. The "same device" ends up being true only for as long as the 
master at the other end exists - and the same numbers get re-used in all 
normal usage for different virtual devices.

That "stupid" thing is a hell of a lot less stupid than the alternatives, 
and is very much equivalent to how pty's work. 
In fact, the "number according to detection" is pretty much the best 
device number allocation strategy. It's the _only_ one that doesn't have 
some incorrect bias built-in.
