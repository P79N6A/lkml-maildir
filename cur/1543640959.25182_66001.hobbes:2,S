If this is a correct statement of what you want, we're building it:
    Instead of seeing events in time order of creation, you want to
    see the events in order of arrival in a particular repository.
I agree that the current view is useless when what you want to know is
when did this change finally make it into the tree?
We're working on a "stack" of incoming events.  BK/Web will use this to
give you the display you want and bk undo will be able to use this to
roll your repository backwards by "popping" the stack.  You could do
	while true
	do	bk undo -sf
	done
and when it gets done, you'll have no repository, it will have popped it
away.  bk unpull will just be come a special case of popping the stack.
