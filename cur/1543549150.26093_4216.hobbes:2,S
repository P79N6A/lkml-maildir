I have proposed this in the past but Arjan van de Ven opinioned that
since the config choice for procfs is after the COMX choice (thus
nulling your COMX option silently if you deselect procfs) the correct
thing would be the documentation patch.
I am inclined to agree with him (hence my submitted patch) bit if
you and/or Linux feels otherwise I can fix the config.in, no problem.
