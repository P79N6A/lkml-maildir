lspci -vvv on the slot can tell you what has been negotiated. Also, you
can figure the effective PCIe bandwidth using ~200 MB/s as a rule of
thumb, given the various overheads on the bus. So an x4 won't fully load
up a 10Gbps link.
At least, that's what we're seeing in x8 slots using Infiniband cards,
so your mileage may vary.
