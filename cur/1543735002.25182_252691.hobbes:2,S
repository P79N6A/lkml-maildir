Hey, Andy.
I'd like, if possible, to have ACPI use kevents.  ACPI makes sense as a
user.
The first question is whether or not ACPI could use the current kevent
model.  The current reactionary response is that kevent is too limited,
but that misses the point a bit.  The point is that you create kobjects
and better integrate with sysfs, and then kevent becomes trivial.
So if ACPI better took advantage of sysfs, would kevents be sufficient?
