Andrea,
what happened to Andrew James Wade's rewording [1] of your config help? 
   It seemed to disappear from what was submitted to akpm.
To "mathematically prevent covert channels" is far too strong a claim to 
make, since you only handle the case of TSC-related timing attacks. 
AJW's wording is much better, so please don't drop it.
Of course, if the new wording will be included in some forthcoming patch 
that also makes Linus happy [2], then never mind.
