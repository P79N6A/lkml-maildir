Apologies in advance for a slightly off-topic post, but the aic7xxx
mailing list is more than a little quiescent these days...  I *did*
try there first.
Hardware: Adaptec 2930U2 with WDE 18300 LVD hard drive (nothing
else attached to card)
Problem Summary: card firmware routines can detect/format/verify
the drive just fine, but the aic7xxx driver goes into a timeout/reset
loop on driver initialization.
A little more detail:
Have tried the driver both compiled-in and as a module: no difference.
Have tried the driver option "seltime:0" -- no difference.  TCQ is
disabled by default per the caveat about having it enabled with WDE
drives.  AIC7XXX_RESET_DELAY is currently 5 seconds (the default), but
I'm going to try 15 seconds to see if that helps or otherwise makes
any difference.
I have detailed logs available if anyone is interested.  Any advice
and/or suggestions would be gratefully received.  Thanks!
