Boot time calibration can't be perfect... I depends very much on the
quality of what your are calibrating against, and the bus path to it.
On most pmacs, I'm calibrating either against a VIA timer which isn't
_that_ good or on OF value (which are themselves calibrated, I think,
against the KeyLargo timer).
On all cases, those will drift some way from what the NTP server will
give, either a lot or not, it will. So we may end up adjusting our
kernel rate and thus opening a window for the problem.
Ben.
