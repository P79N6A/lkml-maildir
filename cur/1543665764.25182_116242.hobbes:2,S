Hi Ruslan,
I understand your concern, actually the code that prevents users from using
als100 without CONFIG_PNP is hidden in kconfig.
config SND_ALS100
	tristate "Avance Logic ALS100/ALS120"
	depends on SND && ISAPNP
	help
	  Say 'Y' or 'M' to include support for Avance Logic ALS100, ALS110,
	  ALS120 and ALS200 soundcards.
--->Notice ISAPNP
Also the pnp functions are declared as blank inline functions if CONFIG_PNP
isn't set (see pnp.h).  This will prevent compile errors.  When ALSA drivers
contain support for both pnp and nonpnp devices (such as sb16), CONFIG_PNP
will be used directly in the code.
Best regards to you as well.
Thanks,
Adam
