htonl() itself is wrong, using the letter 'l' to denote something which isn't 
a long.
This is legacy stuff - so perhaps it should be left - although if it's not 
visible to user space I'm inclined to suggest that it should be fixed anyway. 
There's no real excuse for continuing to use [bwl] suffixes for other macros 
like PCI access, though - is there?
