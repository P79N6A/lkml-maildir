SELinux can do this, it's policy-flexible.  You can even simulate a 
pathame-based policy language with a consequential loss of control:

That is not the point of this discussion, although we can at least be 
thankful that Linus didn't request that the networking layer be pluggable 
to the extent that the security layer is, otherwise we'd have a menagerie 
of "better" TCP stacks, TOE frameworks, STREAMS modules and whatever other 
fantastic ideas that people might be inclined to drag out of the kitchen 
sink.
