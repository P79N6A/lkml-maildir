I'll give you another reason :-)
If I do have multiple active struct consoles registered (e.g. normal tty0 or
ttyS0 and a debug console without a real tty), and the /dev/console demux
thinks the debug console is the real one (the one opened if you open
/dev/console), printk() messages will appear on both active consoles, but
/dev/console cannot be opened.
To avoid this problem, the /dev/console demux should walk the list of active
consoles until it finds one that can be opened, or fall back to /dev/null if
none is found.
Does that sound reasonable?
