I have the same problem.
Upgraded to 2.6.16-rc5, the problem does not go away.
I also have intel nics and the e1000 driver. Upgraded to the latest
driver via intel website, that didn't fix it either.
The only fix is to turn "tcp segmentation offload" off. Not a good
solution.
Anyone got any idea? Is there a patch somewhere I can apply that
should fix this?
Regards,
Johan
