Search again :)
jgarzik's libata supports the promise SATA chips. The support is a
little preliminary still, but it seems to work ok for many.
libata is already merged in 2.6.0-test, and is available as a patch for
2.4 on ftp.kernel.org.
Jeff has also said on the list that promise is cooperating on this open
source driver.
