Hi,
I know this is a bit OT but because here are the kernel driver hackers
this might be the right place to ask.
I am looking for a couple of PCI Gigabit ethernet adapters to play
around with SAN/NAS stuff like iSCSI and HyperSCSI and the like. There
are variuos adapters around which work with Linux. My choice would be
based on the following:
- Relatively cheap, around $100/EUR100
- 32 bit/33MHz PCI compatible
- Low cpu usage
- Busmaster DMA
- Opensource Linux driver
- zero-copy capable
- etc.
What card is best? 3Com, Intel or National Semi based?
Thanks,
Jurgen
