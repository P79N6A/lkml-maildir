<body>Just a theory, no idea if it's related.&nbsp; Since about 2.3.40-pre4 I
 have had problems with my cardbus controller.&nbsp; It's seems that the changes
 to yenta_probe_irq would 1. report incorrect IRQ's and 2. render my pcmcia
 network card unusable.&nbsp; I have an IBM thinpad 600E, which I believe has
 a TI PCI1251 cardbus controller.&nbsp; Normally, this controller is on IRQ11,
 however, the new probe routine reports about six different IRQ's.&nbsp; In addition,
 the following line causes a "lockup" of the controller:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; cb_writel(socket, CB_SOCKET_FORCE, CB_FCARDSTS);<br>If
 I comment out this line and return a mask of cb_irq, the problem still persists
 until I physically eject the card in the socket, reinsert it and reboot.&nbsp;
 The card is the notorious ibm etherjet aka xircom cbe network adapter. &nbsp;
 Additionally, on boot, the following is reported when the problem is encountered:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; Socket status: 30000020<br>and the following is reported when the above fix is made and all works well:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; Socket status: 30000920<br><br>I
 don't know if any of this is related.&nbsp; I don't experience keyboard lockups.&nbsp;
 However, from what I can gather, the lockups occured at approximately the
 same kernel revision and are related to the yenta driver.<br><br>Please cc: me with any replies.<br><br>Tim Raymond<br></body>
