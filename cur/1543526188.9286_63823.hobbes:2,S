How long have you had this motherboard?  How long after you got it did
you first start seeing this problem?

If you fix PC's then troubleshooting hardware shouldn't be anything new

What you describe I've seen before.  Here's a few things to check:
Check that none of the mounting screws are stressing the motherboard.  If
you had to force a screw into position or shift/bend the motherboard to
get the holes to line up, then you've just stressed it.  Stressing the
board can cause traces to crack/break.  From then on, the temperature of
the board determines the traces conductivity.  I recommend pulling all
the cards and re-positioning the motherboard.  Also, make sure that you
don't have to be overly forceful to insert a card.  Check the alignment
of the cards connector with the slot on the motherboard.  If you have to
shift the card to make it fit, then you might be putting stress on the
connector and/or card.
Check that there is addequate ventilation.  Run the system for 24 hours
then immediately open the case and touch the board and all the ICs
(ground yourself first!).  Are they hot to the touch?  If so, then you
probably don't have enough air flow.  A lot of people think that the fan
in the PS is "enough".  In many cases, the design of the computer case
doesn't provide very good air flow.  Hard disks today tend to run hot,
contributing to the ambient temperature inside the case.  Often, just
installing a second fan to circulate the air makes a difference.

Classic symptoms of over-heating and can also indicate that a cracked
trace is opening up after being heated sufficiently.

Ouch!  Did you experience your crashes before or after your operation on
the CPU?  Breaking the ceramic casing means you might have damaged
something else.  Have you tried another CPU on the board?  Have you tried
the CPU in another known good system?

Let's not jump to conclusions (pun ;-).  Heat related problems are
solvable with a little extra ventilation.  Cracked traces, however, are
harder to solve.  Answers to the above will reveal more.
