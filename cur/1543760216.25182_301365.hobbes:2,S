Just to clarify here, these data need to be taken at grain of salt. A
high count in _spin_unlock_* functions do not automatically points to
lock contention.  It's one of the blind spot syndrome with timer based
profile on ia64.  There are some lock contentions in 2.6 kernel that
we are staring at.  Please do not misinterpret the number here.
