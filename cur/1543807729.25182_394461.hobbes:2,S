It's slightly different:
EMBEDDED is limited to options allowing additional space savings for 
machines with strong space limits.
If you have enough RAM that VMSPLIT matters, you shouldn't enable 
EMBEDDED.
What we could do is to add an additional ADVANCED_USER option that hides 
options like VMSPLIT or the NAPI options for net drivers.
This would result in the following (the text for ADVANCED_USER isn't 
good, but you get the idea):
config ADVANCED_USER
	bool "ask questions that require a deeper knowledge of the kernel"
config EXPERIMENTAL
	bool "Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers"
	depends on ADVANCED_USER
menuconfig EMBEDDED
        bool "Configure standard kernel features (for small systems)"
        depends on ADVANCED_USER
