Well as just a user, this patch seems to work, and is actively being
worked on and maintained for modern kernels (which unforunately Ulrich
Windl's patch hardly appears to be).  
This one also seems much less intrusive, doesn't break serial console
systems (I sent a patch to Ulrich Windl to fix that, due to one of
many places where pointers are dereferenced without being checked for
!NULL first).
Is LinuxPPS better?  I have no idea, and I don't think I am qualified to
say one way or another.  I do know that I could apply it to 2.6.18 with
minimal work, while I couldn't get Ulrich Windl's patch to do so (too
much has changed since 2.6.15, while I did manage to get it to apply to
2.6.16 with quite a bit of work).
Having PPS support actually part of the kernel would make it much
simpler to deal with in the future, and perhaps ntp would start being
compiled with such support regularly.
