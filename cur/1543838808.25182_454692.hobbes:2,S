Hmmm. I wonder what "normal" system calls are.  And how they contrast
to "abnormal" system calls, which presumably aren't covered by the
above note.
I wonder if reading and writing to files in /sys and /proc are
'normal' in this context or not.  Certainly I think that non-standard
ioctls could be considered to abnormal.
I guess that's one for the lawyers :-)
