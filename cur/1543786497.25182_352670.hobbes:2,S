Pavel, AFAIU,
Joern meant that if HDD starts a block write operation, it will 
accomplish it even if power-fail happens (probably there are some 
capacitors there). So, it is impossible, say, that HDD has written one 
half of a sector and has not written the other half.
And he wanted to say that DataFlash HW does not guarante this. But, 
perhaps, adding a special HW, this is implementable.
