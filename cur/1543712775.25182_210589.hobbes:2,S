Well, I asked for this because there is similar case with some DRI drivers in 
kernel. These drivers use cmpxchg and some time ago it was not possible to 
build them for i386 (and of course run on 486+). This AFAIK did not change.
These not yet written parts of kernel do not exist so nothing to worry about 
right now. Anyway there always could be #warning for i386 - easy to catch 
while compiling and would allow to fix that future kernel code then.
