I have once experimenting with this on request from Olaf.
The only way I could fine was to pass a new define:
-DKBUILD_FILE='short-file-name' to gcc.
This has the sideeffect that we always accuse the main .c file for
being the culprint.
gcc warns if we override __FILE__
__FILE__ is used in 123 files of wich 26 is within arch/
so it will take a while to change...
I can cook up something if there is interest.
