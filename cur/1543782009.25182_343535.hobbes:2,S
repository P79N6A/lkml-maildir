Dear readers,
I'm the owner of a Sony VAIO notebook with a PCI-based memorystick drive, 
PCI ID is 104D/808A. So far, no Linux driver has been developed. I am quite 
experienced with driver development, though not for Linux.
Background:
I work on a DOS-based OS ( 
http://www.deskwork.de/
 ), written in Borland 
Pascal and Assembler for Protected Mode, thus I'm fairly experienced with 
driver development from scratch. My plan is to write a driver in BP and 
release it along with lots of comments and a neat PDF specification into 
the public domain, ready to be ported to Linux, Zeta or whatever.
How far I got:
I was able to assign 1 KB of I/O memory to the device (the amount it gets 
under Windows). At offset 100h, a 512 byte buffer is located. The byte at 
offset 08h indicates whether a stick is inserted (=01h) or not (=00h). The 
512 byte buffer shows strange behaviour (no details here), and I cannot 
read or write anything yet.
Needed:
It would be helpful to get in touch with people who develop drivers and/or 
own a Sony laptop with said drive for testing. I think it's still a quite 
long way to go. I am currently not subscribed to the kernel mailing list.
Kind regards,
Konstantin Koll
