I think this is a mix-up of concepts. You mean aic7xxx, right?
IMHO, it's an example of a device which needs various masks
for different allocations. As it happens, the driver uses
consistent allocations with one mask, streaming allocations
with other mask. This is a pure coincidence, however. Being
consistent or streaming is one thing, and asking for various
masks is another thing.
But I see that there may be practical differences if we suddenly
make pci_set_dma_mask act upon consistent allocations. So,
perhaps you're right... Let's add a call...

I think it's not a query, but a request, but I'm not a native
speaker.

pci_set_consistent_dma_mask, surely.

This is cool, but where is the implementation?
I do not see anyone honouring the ->consistent_dma_mask
in the patch. I'm stupid, right?
