Fair enough. Current access I think should be cheap though (it is
effectively a constant), but I guess it is still improvement.

Ah, that works.

But it doesn't mean you have to ;)

Well that bit of code alone is obviously unreadable.
restart->arg3 = 0;
if (futex64)
     restart->arg3 |= FUTEX_64;
if (shared)
     restart->arg3 |= FUTEX_SHARED;
Maybe a matter of taste.

Why not call it cmd? (ie. what it is, rather than what you have done
to derive it).
