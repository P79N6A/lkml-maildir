2.6.18 is the latest released kernel, I don't think calling one release 
back "ancient" is really advancing the solution. The problem seems to 
have been reported in August, and is still not fixed, I do understand 
that he would feel there is no progress.
How long will you wait before putting in the fix Marc Perkel suggested, 
perhaps with a warning logged that it's a band-aid? Many users will not 
be astute enough to find this discussion, the bug report, the fix, 
configure and build a kernel, etc. And not all distributions will 
address it either.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
