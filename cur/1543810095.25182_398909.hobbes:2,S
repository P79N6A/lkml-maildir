I'm not sure.  Suspend is not a surprise, so you can do things so that
you don't lose anything (what I described is pretty much unmounting
while keeping file references).  Surprise unplug, there is no way you
can make the filesystem clean if it wasn't already.
I also think that USB flash and this kind of things should go back to
clean state as soon as possible even whe mountd, but that's a
different issue.
  OG.
