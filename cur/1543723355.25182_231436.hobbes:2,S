Hi,
I recently got a CD back from a photo lab with Fuji Frontier minilabs.
It had five films scanned and written in one film per session. Linux
2.4.27-mumble shows all the data of the CD right away, Linux 2.6.7
required mount -o session=4 for me to see all directories, without that
option, I'd only see the oldest session.
Has anyone else observed such behaviour?
