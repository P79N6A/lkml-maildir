Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.19-rc1/2.5.25 provide dummy fsync() routine for directories on NFS mounts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
   There was a bug reported on the 'exim' user list a couple of months ago: 
the Linux NFS client reports -EINVAL if you try to fsync() a directory.
   The correct response would be to return a dummy '0' for success, since all 
NFS operations that change the directory are supposed to be performed 
synchronously on the server anyway...
Cheers,
  Trond
