Well I'll be damned. It took 18 days to show up. Though I've been
riding this baby heavy for about a week.
So I've gettimeofday() jumping backwards again.
# uname -a
Linux tienel 2.6.0-test9 #2 SMP Sun Oct 26 14:35:02 EET 2003 i686 GNU/Linux
It's this test I'm running (snipped from previous TSC desych
-conversation):
- -
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
int main( void )
{
        int                     i = 0;
        while( 1 )
        {
                struct timeval          start;
                struct timeval          stop;
                struct timeval          diff;
                int                     rc1;
                int                     rc2;
                if( i++ % 1000000 == 0 )
                        printf( "% 12d: Iterations so far\n", i );
                rc1 = gettimeofday( &start, 0 );
                rc2 = gettimeofday( &stop, 0 );
                timersub( &stop, &start, &diff );
                if( rc1 < 0 || rc2 < 0 )
                        printf( " %12d: rc1=%d rc2=%d.   Failure!\n",
                                i,

                                rc2
                        );
                if( diff.tv_sec >= 0 && diff.tv_usec >= 0 )
                        continue;
                printf( "% 12d: Time went backwards: %d:%06d\n",

                );
        }
