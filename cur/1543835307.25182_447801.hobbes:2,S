Pretty much everything in this paragraph is wrong, except for the part
about the difficulty of making a single unified event loop and the
resulting pipe hack that everybody uses to get around that.
Solaris lets you specify SIGEV_PORT in your struct sigevent which then
queues timer completions (or anything else that takes a struct sigevent,
like POSIX AIO) to a port and then all types of queued events (including
fd polling and user generated events) can be waited on and fetched with
a single function call.
Something similar could probably worked up in Linux which queues timer
completions to an AIO context.
You might also want to look into the event channel / kevent discussion
that's currently in progress.
