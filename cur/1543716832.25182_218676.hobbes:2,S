The output format of the sprintf() gives 58 characters per entry, which
with a 4k page allows for 70 entries before the page overflows, which
feels borderline for ccNUMA machines.  On ia64 the pagesize is usually
16k, which would allow 282 entries.  I think this will fail on a 128
node SGI sn2 (because there are 4 memory banks per node => min 512
entries
in the memory map).
