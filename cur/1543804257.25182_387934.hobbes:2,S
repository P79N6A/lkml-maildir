I'll have to try and get around to that soon - I'm currently busy with some 
various work and can't afford the time just yet :/.
Also, I just realized that I copied lkml and scsi without providing any useful 
context. Kernel is 2.6.15-ck1 with the Marvell sk98lin patch and (barf) 
nvidia.ko. I noticed after having the OOM killer make its rounds a few times 
that the slab layer was eating in excess of 600MB.

...but I don't think this is directly related, because this has been happening 
since at least 2.6.13 iirc. Just being thorough.
Apologies to lkml & scsi for the brief/confusing earlier message.
