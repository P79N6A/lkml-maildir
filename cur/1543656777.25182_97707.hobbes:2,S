I assume you're talking about :
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10
As the reporter, I'll tell you plainly bugzilla rocks for this.
This bug was first reported in linux-kernel, then was picked in the 2.5 problem 
reports, then (when bugzilla.kernel.org) was announced reported again in 
bugzilla.
Bugzilla enabled the report to be ping-ponged among maintainers until someone 
accepted it. And it can be found by other people now (note you missed the linux 
kernel  report when you posted this). No one was interested before the bugzilla
report.
Bugzilla can be a pain sometimes, it's not intuitive, it's suffering yet from its
hackish bastard origin, but it works, lots of projects are using it (both because
its so easy to deploy and people are familiar with it - try rt
I-need-30+-perl-packages-to-work-only-I-use hell for example) and it's improving.
2.17.1 (seen both at 
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/
 and 
http://bugzilla.redhat.com/
)
is a *huge* improvement, I can't wait for it to be released for everyone (right now
the bugzilla team has a hard time integrating all the features everyone and his dog
have been contributing back to the project lately).
All bugzilla's I've seen so far would benefit from better version tracking.
All bugzilla's I've seen so far would benefit from better UI.
The problems raised in this thread are pretty generic. They should be tackled a generic
way in the original project.
However I wouldn't even touch any other bug reporting system. Others (like rt) boast a
better original design ; the truth is they have their own warts but not a community
the size of bugzilla to find/fix them (and I'm not even talking about security audits).
Once you've grokked bugzilla (which I freely admit is long and painful) you'll find it's
actually rather powerful and you'll be trained to interact with :
- mozilla bugzilla
- kernel bugzilla
- apache bugzilla
- gnome bugzilla
- kde bugzilla
- abiword bugzilla
- red hat bugzilla
and so on (and all of these deployments have useful tweaks that trickle back in the 
original bugzilla)
Not having to learn a new UI to report a bug in another project is quite nice. I know I'd 
have thought twice about the feedback I've given to various organizations otherwise.
