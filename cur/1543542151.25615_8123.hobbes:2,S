Are you logging the _reason_ that the buffer is not being merged?
Simply saying it's not merged is a bit rough, it would be nice to know
why the elevator couldn't/wouldn't merge it. Also, have you looked into
how the elevator works and when/why it deliberately doesn't merge buffers?

You will only see the noreq case, when the elevator has already tried
and merged the block (it would make no sense to block waiting for a
free request slot, if the buffer could have been merged) and either
found that no matches were found, or that coalescing should not be
done because of latency considerations.
