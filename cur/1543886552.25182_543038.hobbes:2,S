The thought did cross my mind, and yes I think that would be a good
idea. The whole thing should probably just migrate to
lib/scattersomething.c

I don't like using sg->length, as that may be modified for legitimate
reason. That's why I chose to use the lsb bit of the page pointer.

It's hard to say, depends heavily on the sub system or arch. Even if
using the pointer tagging mechanism seems a bit nasty, I think it's the
more resilient approach.
