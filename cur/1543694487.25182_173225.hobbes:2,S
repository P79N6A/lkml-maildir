Yep. And several manufacturers have told us that they don't put any
"bypass" commands in their firmware so as a data-recovery company we
can't bypass the normal stuff. On SCSI drives we get to set the
"number of retiries" and things like that. Terribly useful. Not on ATA
drives.

Yes, as an experienced data-recovery-expert I can look at the data,
and say that I believe it. And I know the risks you explain here.

Nope. Even on SCSI drives there seems to be no way to tell the drive
"please give me the data for raw block XXX". We've pushed the
manufacturers for the ability to do this, but we get nowhere. Feel
free to prove us wrong. Armwaving doesn't work.
