Hi,
I'm kind of frustrated, right now I had to reinstall on the quick my
MacOS on my PowerBook. I don't know if that has something to do with
Alans ac's. But today I got the ac2 of 2.2.11 to compile on my Book, it
went ok as far the process was concerned. Thanks Alan for merging all
the ppc stuff. One thing I don't understand, why the heck has the
vmlinux size grown from two to 6.2MB with the default config??? Can
anybody tell me?
And were there some changes in the hfs support??
I hosed my system TOTALLY, I used xhfs, which I think is a frontend for
hfs support, to transfer the vmlinux to my hfs partition, two times ok,
the third.....
Anyway, maybe a an unlucky combination.
Thanks for any hint, hope to get my my machine back to life. (sorry if
it is an un-wrong/formated) mail
Andreas
