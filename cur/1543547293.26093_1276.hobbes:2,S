Thanks for all the replies so far (public and private).  Just to clarify:  
the argument is Compaq Tru64 vs linux for a large (~1000 node) cluster of 
alphas.  NT is not in the running, so old ammo from the desktop wars 
won't help here.
What I'm looking for is someone who is running a large number of nodes and 
has gathered statistics reflecting the average number of system crashes over 
time.  Obviously this depends on hardware, workload, power, etc.;  however 
a good MTBF for any cluster of linux systems would help build a little 
confidence.  
Simply pointing to the many large HPC linux clusters in use all over the 
world, or even at other U.S. energy labs apparently isn't convincing enough.
Thanks again,
Jim
