Yeah, I'm not suggesting killing it completely, just putting the limit
at that level rather than limiting watches completely.
The other thing I've looked at is just limiting watches per process to
rlim[RLIMIT_NFILE].  Any reason why that wouldn't be enough?  It means
you get limited to less than RLIMIT_NFILE if you add the same file
descriptor to multiple epolls... but that's not too scary.

That would only add a couple of "epoll watching epoll" instances though - you
could still limit that to a pretty low number and not impact normal use.
