I tested it only on files without hardlink (with i_nlink == 1) --- most 
programs (except diff) are tolerant to collision, they won't store st_ino 
in memory unless i_nlink > 1.
I didn't hardlink directories, I just patched stat, lstat and fstat to 
always return st_ino == 0 --- and I've seen those failures. These failures 
are going to happen on non-POSIX filesystems in real world too, very 
rarely.
BTW. POSIX supports (optionally) hardlinked directories but doesn't 
supoprt colliding st_ino --- so programs act according to POSIX --- but 
the problem is that this POSIX requirement no longer represents real world 
situation.

This is not a bug but a feature. If filesystem doesn't count 
subdirectories, it should set directory's n_link to 1 and find will be ok.

Yes, but they have big problems with directory ino_t collisions. They 
think that directories are hardlinked and skip processing them.
