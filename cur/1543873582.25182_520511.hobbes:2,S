Are you assuming the other cpus might be idle?
It depends on the load of the system also, right. If all the cpus are
loaded, then increasing the period will decrease the frequency.
If some of the cpus are idle, then it doesn't matter what context
switch rate we use(as we don't get context switched out by other task).

BTW, the overhead is not just the context switch cost, but also the cache
evictions that the incoming process will bring.

I am with you. But lets say, if these tasks are not interactive, then
what is the need for paying this penality?
