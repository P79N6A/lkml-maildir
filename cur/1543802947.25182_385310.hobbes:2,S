Timertop itself tries to not steals to much cpu whereas tries to be
less intrusive as possible. So ordering is not available yet.
But one can have a backgroud aquisition of data using:
timertop -t 50
There will be 50 s of aquisition saved in a text file so that you can
do some post-processing and order it properly.
