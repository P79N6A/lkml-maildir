Hello,
I have an Ensoniq ES1371 with a joystick port, so the
joystick driver depends on the snd-ens1371 (I use alsa)
module to be loaded.
With this line in /etc/modprobe.conf, I can use the joystick
as soon as the sound module is loaded.
install snd-ens1371 /sbin/modprobe -i snd-ens1371; \
                    /usr/sbin/alsactl restore;     \
                    /sbin/modprobe -iq joydev;     \
                    /sbin/modprobe -iq analog
But I'd like to be able to use the joystick without manually
loading the sound module. With 2.4 I would put "alias char-major-XX sound"
in /etc/modules.conf with XX being js0 major number. Unfortunately,
with 2.6 if I cat /dev/js0 without the sound module loaded, it does
not find the joystick but does not try to load any module on which I could hook.
Also, between 2.6.0-test5 and 2.6.0-test6 my joystick stopped
working properly. When cat'ting /dev/js0 I still can get some output
when I play with the joystick but xmms using
ioctl(joy_fd, JSIOCGBUTTONS, &joy_buttons);
sees 0 buttons for my joysticks which has 4.
Not sure if it helps, but my not so trained eyes see much more output
with 2.6.0-test6 than 2.6.0-test5 with cat /dev/js0 and me playing with
the joystick.
Thanks for any help.
Guillaume.
