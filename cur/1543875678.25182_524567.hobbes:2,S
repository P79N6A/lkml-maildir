Doh!  I was reading the code wrong.  We only mask if we're still
handling a previous interrupt on the same vector.  My bad.
However, I can't really see where mask() is used outside of that
instance.  Which then leads us back to the question:  do we need
a read flush on mask/unmask or just enable/disable?
