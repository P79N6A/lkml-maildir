On our LUG list (linux@lug-owl.de) we had such a case as well, about a
year ago.

The point is that most people either use the on-board stuff, _or_ they
buy a soundcard to use that one. Vendors seem to think they shouldn't
confuse users with always letting them choose between _two_ sound
cards.
There are two trick you can play. Either disable the card in the PCI
config space, or (in older mainboards of i486 class with ISA) they
used custom ASICs in between that were activated by some magic
sequence written to some magic ISA I/O ports.
In the first case, it's quite simple to figure out how to re-enable
the card. If this is an issue somewhere, please feel free to ask for
help. Maybe even a little helper program could be written to aid in
finding the appropriate bits.
