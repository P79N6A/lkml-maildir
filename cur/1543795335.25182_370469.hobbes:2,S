Bill,
No, I didn't get an answer on this. I've done some more experiments
with the drives, but since they are connected to an Adaptec 2400A RAID
controller (in JBOD mode) I need to go through some I2O driver in or
to see the drives at all. So I never have direct access to these
drives as /dev/hdN or /dev/sdN. There are however two different
drivers available for this RAID controller, one is the standard I2O
driver and the other one is the Adaptec dpt_i2o driver.
The results are the same though whether I use the Linux I2O driver or
the Adaptec dpt_i2o, the software raid array is rebuilding at roughly
half the speed when the drives are partioned. I don't know what other
data to provide in ordet to get any further in the testing.
Thanks
Daniel
