Hi,
 This crash report may not be useful as I compiled the kernel with
 a late snapshot of EGCS. It happened after nearly five days of
 uptime during updatedb. This is on an AMD K6-2/333, IDE, 64mb
 EDO RAM (I'll supply further information if needed). These
 messages appeared in the log:
 Feb  2 07:40:05 jackalz kernel: iput: inode 03:03/315401 count wrapped
 Feb  2 07:40:05 jackalz kernel: iput: inode 03:03/385044 count wrapped
 Feb  2 07:40:05 jackalz kernel: iput: inode 03:03/385046 count wrapped
 Feb  2 07:40:07 jackalz kernel: iput: inode 03:03/487489 count wrapped
 Feb  2 07:40:07 jackalz kernel: iput: inode 03:03/487504 count wrapped
 After that, it was pretty much dead, though it would respond to sysrq and
 console switching. No OOPS. According to sysrq-showpc, EIP was at
 c0130237:
 c0130154 T d_rehash
 c0130198 T d_lookup
 c0130268 T d_validate
 c01302e4 T is_subdir
 c013030c T sync_inodes
 sysrq-sync and sysrq-umount had no effect. I rebooted with sysrq-b and
 fsck found some minor filesystem damage, but no critical files were
 trashed. This also happened to me with 2.2.0, but there were so many
 bug reports at the time and I am somewhat hesitant to post bug reports
 for EGCS compiled kernels. Sorry if I left anything out.
