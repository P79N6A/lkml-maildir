That was true from Linux 1.1.67 (when Alpha was introduced) to 1.1.84
(when __[PS]* was introduced).  I'm not sure the Alpha target even
worked during those versions.  Since Linux 1.1.84, it has mapped pages
on the Alpha without execute permission: the _PAGE_FOE (fault on exec)
bit is set for mappings which don't have PROT_EXEC.
Btw, they used PAGE_EXECONLY in those days :)
