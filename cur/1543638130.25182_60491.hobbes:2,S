Hello,
unfortunately the kernel doesn't compile:
lvm.c:1: #error Broken until maintainers will sanitize kdev_t handling

this is with:  gcc --version 2.95.4
well, I use lvm, now I could try to compile without lvm support and
boot into single user mode, and see if that works... or could you send
me the function in question (maybe as a patch to 2.4.19-rc3?) - and if
it works then, maybe the 2.4.19 final will include the patch?
thanks for your support,
	Peter
