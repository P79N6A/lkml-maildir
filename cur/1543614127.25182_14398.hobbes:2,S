However, on seeing your other message, I take that back. See my other
reply.

Yes, something in the kernel has changed. New devfs core, which
doesn't work with broken drivers, and generates warning messages for
bad configurations. But those are warnings, and broken configurations
should continue to work (in 2.4, in 2.5 they won't). The problem you
are having is unrelated to a broken configuration. See other message.
