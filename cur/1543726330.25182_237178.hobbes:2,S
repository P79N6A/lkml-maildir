I'm currently wondering whether part of our discussion might be about a 
non-issue:
It's true that there's not a pressing need for opening 2.7 today.
But do you assume that this will still be true one year from now?
If 2.7 will open during the next 12 months, "mid-2005" would still be 
after 2.7 opened, and such non-urgent cleanups could then go into 2.7 .
