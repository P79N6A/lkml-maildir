IMO a change this huge (and potentially controversial, see below) would
have needed to happen back in 2.5.x. Since that's in the past now, I
think it'll have to wait for 2.7.x.

PaX has competition:
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/exec-shield/
The pros and cons of ExecShield and PaX would need to be compared before
either one can be incorporated into the mainline kernel.

I would argue that grsec doesn't "kill the problem at its source", but
rather mitigates things when it's already too late to kill the problem
at its source. IMO "kill[ing] the problem at its source" requires fixing
programs to be non-exploitable.
Grsec certainly provides additional security, but I don't think we
should hype it too much either.

Adding grsec after 2.6 is released would be absolutely *ludicrous* IMO.
I think if it's going to go into the mainline kernel it needs the kind
of scrutiny and testing that would be best provided by inclusion in
2.7.

I think "the other side of the argument" completely kills the idea for
now...

As do I, but I don't want to see anything like the 2.4 VM debacle
happen again in 2.6...
