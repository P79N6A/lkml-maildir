That strace shows that trying to open /dev/null fails with ENXIO:
	[pid  6050] open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY <unfinished ...>
	[pid  6050] <... open resumed> )        = -1 ENXIO (No such device or address)
and everything goes downhill from there.
It would be worth looking at your /dev/null to see what kind of (broken) 
device node it is, and get a clue about *why* it is broken.
Greg, any udev breakage that could affect /dev/null?

Hmm. I assume the "-git6" and "-git7" are 2.6.24-rc4-gitX, ie commits
 - 2.6.24-rc5-git6: 3e3b3916a9c5c28a16528585478de19fea59816b
 - 2.6.24-rc5-git7: fbdcf18df73758b2e187ab94678b30cd5f6ff9f9
and doing a
	gitk 3e3b3916a9..fbdcf18df7
does show a SCSI merge, and two commits that touch drivers/scsi/initio.*.
James, Alan and Boaz, ideas?
