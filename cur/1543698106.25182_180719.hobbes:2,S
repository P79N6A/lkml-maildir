I don't think it changed. CHS support is needed for backward compatibility
during boot. This is why it would be important not to screw it, if it's
indeed matter in the partition table. Some reading how NT gets/uses drive
geometry,

Google Zeitgeist says for september at 
http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist/sep03_pie.gif
	XP    38% 
	98    29%
	2000  20%
	NT     3%
	95     1%
XP is growing 1-2% each month at the expense of Win9x (see

The majority of NT based uses NTFS. NTFS has its own $Boot file fixed at
sector 0, that is it's the boot sector. I don't know how much it's
different from the one booting from FAT but I guess not much (except of 
understanding NTFS instead of FAT during boot, etc).
