Hmmm, allocating a single lock is ugly indeed, but I still want
the high level kfifo_get / kfifo_put to do the locking themselves...
We could do that by having a 'spinlock_t internal_lock' and a 
'spinlock_t * lock' fields, in struct kfifo: we always use 'lock' and
we initialize lock to either &internal_lock or to the user lock.
