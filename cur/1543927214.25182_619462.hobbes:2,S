That's actually not too bad ... 
I'm having a problem with reverting SCSI to use an allocation for the
sense buffer, because it can fail and the new scso_eh_prep_cmnd() isn't
supposed to return a failure. I've changed that but now I get into
trying to fix the various drivers that use it without checking the
result code and it's becoming much more complicated than initially
thought.
So I may do the above instead and revive your patch.
Any objection ? James ? David ?
Cheers,
Ben.
