Yes, and but it isn't a generic implementation in mm/filemap.c,
it is a compatibility layer.  It lives with the current deficiencies
instead of removes them.

Always?
Ugh.  I just realized looking at the xfs code that it doesn't
work in the presence of high memory, at least not with 4K pages.

But that is how mm/filemap.c works.  The calls into the filesystem
can be per multi-page group as they are current per page.  The point
is that the existing in kernel abstraction  is already larger then a
page for doing the work.

Yes.  You are talking about only fixing the kernel for your giant
64K block filesystems that are only interesting on peta-byte arrays.
I am pointing out that the other fixes that have been discussed.
Optimistic contiguous page allocation and a larger linux scatter
gather list.  Are interesting on much smaller filesystem and machine
sizes where small files are still interesting.  Making them generally
better improvements for linux.
If you only improve the giant peta-byte raid cases 99% of linux users
simply don't care, and so the code isn't very interesting.
