Peter,
The 3ware management tools quit working when we removed the proc_name interface 
during the re-write and created sysfs attributes.  We are modifying the 3ware
management tools to use the sysfs interface for rescan's, etc.
I am also working with Bruce Allen (smartmontools developer) to make the
3w-9xxx driver work with smartmontools.  This shouldn't require any driver changes.

Subject: 3ware 9500S Drivers (mm kernel)
I've been using the 3ware 9500 drivers in the mm kernel for a while now
without any problems, this is on a dual opteron with a 9500S-12 controller
with 6 disk formatted as a raid-5. Are these going to be included in the
vanilla kernel soon?
My only complaints with the drivers are that smartctl doesnt work with them
(fedora core 2), and the 3ware management tools from the 3ware cd wont work
with the mm drivers (wont detect controller).
Thanks
Peter Maas
