We had two userspace wireless monitoring program depending 
on /sys/class/net/<device name>/wireless directory to be present and now its 
gone in 2.6.15 and I can't find one line of changelog where its gone or 
why. /sys seems to be the mostly abused part of kernel-userspace relationship 
with changing paths,names and now disappearing directories....
