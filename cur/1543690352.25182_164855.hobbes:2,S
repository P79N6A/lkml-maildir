It uses classic Pentium instruction set. Speed optimized for my 300 MHz
Pentium-2 test box. Original Gladman version that I started with was pretty
fast but I was able to improve performance about 7% over original version.
On my same 300 MHz P2 test box, assembler implementation is about twice as
fast as the mainline kernel C implementation.
