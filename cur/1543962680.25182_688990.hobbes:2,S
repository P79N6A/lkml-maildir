aconf is now ready to take care of defconfig, randconfig and all*config.
That leaves us with two simple tasks for conf.c:
config and oldconfig
[silentoldconfig is gone as oldconfig is 'silent' now].
aconf can take a base config for all the targets and avoids being
clever where to locate it. (Read: does not use DEFCONFIG_LIST).
I dunno if this is what you had in mind but I certainly like the result.
A cleaned up set of patches will soon hit the kbuild list.

I understand the solution that you describe but I fail to see the
usefulness of it.
Can I request you to elaborate a bit more how you see it used.
I can give it a shot if I see it solving a real issue.

This part I did not understand either. I am aware of the current behaviour
but do not get the "dedicated function" thing.
Thanks in advance,
