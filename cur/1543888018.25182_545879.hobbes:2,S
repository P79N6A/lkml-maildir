You're right, you don't hit the 2038 bug here, because you use an
unsigned variable. The bug exists elsewhere because time_t tv_sec
is signed.
Just using nanoseconds probably doesn't gain you much after all
then. You could however just have separate 32 bit fields in the
inode for seconds and nanoseconds, that will result in the exact
same layout that you have right now, but won't require a conversion
function.
