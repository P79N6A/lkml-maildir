There's really only one reason why "make dep" is still there, i.e. the 
future of modversions isn't quite figured out yet. - When modversions was 
still working, "make dep" did regenerate the versioning checksums, it was 
run automatically the first time, but to rerun it, one had to manually do
"make dep".
Currently, it really isn't necessary to run "make dep" at all, but as I 
said, it's not impossible that this changes again.
When Rusty's plans w.r.t modversions work out, "make dep" should be 
history by 2.6, though.
Additional points to consider for davej's document:
- Try "make KBUILD_VERBOSE=0 <whatever target". If you like it,
  put KBUILD_VERBOSE=0 into your environment.
- "make kernel/mm.o" will build the named file, provided a
  corresponding source exists. This also works for (non-composite)
  modules.
