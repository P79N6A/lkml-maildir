Another issues is that at the moment, hotplugging is work in progress. In 
order to resume, you currently need the same kernel build you're booting 
with, and the same hardware configuration in the resumed system. As hotplug 
matures, this restriction might relax, and we could probably come up with a 
way around the former restriction, but at the moment, it really only makes 
sense to try to resume an image you created using the same machine.

Yes, that's the one. Sorry - I didn't mean to give the impression that I wrote 
it. I know about it because I attended the talk.
