The relevant commands are:
mount -t ext2 /dev/hda1 /memory
mount -t unionfs -o dirs=/memory /union
mount -t squashfs /dev/hda2 /newroot
unionctl /union --add --after 0 --mode ro /newroot
chroot /union /sbin/init
The most promissing Idea I had till now is to move the ext2 mount and the 
unionctl past the point were /sbin/rc runs udevstart. I will try it as soon 
as possible.

The busybox umount doesn't support lazy unmount :(
Anyway, I don't think that this would work since the unionfs will be using the 
ext2 partition to the very end and there won't be a chance to unmount it.
