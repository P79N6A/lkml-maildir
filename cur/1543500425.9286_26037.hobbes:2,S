Plan9 does it. With our VFS it is *wrong*. Really wrong. They have
user-available mount() and different processes may have independent
namespaces. So opening connection <=> mounting. That makes sense. Letting
the thing hang around the system-wide namespace doesn't.

Even more obvious candidate for per-process namespace.

Erm... I'ld beg to differ. You are introducing the heck of overhead that
way. And BSD socket API is wider than files one. Ability to use sendto()
is *good*.
