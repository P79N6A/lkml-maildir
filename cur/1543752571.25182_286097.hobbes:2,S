Right now, every project (mc, gnome, kde) has their own vfs implementation,
so that they can work transparently over ftp, handle archives, etc.
Done properly, userspace filesystem like fuse can unify those, plus provide better caching.
It also has chance to be a place for  niche filesystems (like atari800) that would be too much pain to keep in kernel.
