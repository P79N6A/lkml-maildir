I've done a small patch (one line) which tries to implement that.
At as-iosched.c:as_add_request() there's:
        /*
         * set expire time (only used for reads) and add to fifo list
         */
        arq->expires = jiffies + ad->fifo_expire[data_dir];
ad->fifo_expire[data_dir] should be /sys/block/hda/queue/iosched/read_expire
(i've not checked it and i may be wrong) so instead of adding the static read_expire
we increase/decrease it a bit based on current->static_prio
NOTE: I don't even know if static_prio is what i'm searching, just sounds like it is.

The patch should do the following:
read_expire=50 (the default value)
If current->static_prio is -10; the deadline given to the request
is 0; if it's 20 (well, there're only +19 priority i think, but
you get it) the deadline is read_expire*2, and the rest in the
same range.
It isn't a very nice patch; first because deadline 0 is wrong i suppose.
This should be doing read_expire +/- read_expire and probably i'd be
better to set a read_expire +/- 20% read_expire or so. 20 could
be a value exported to sysfs...
Patch effects haven't been tested (I've to awake in 5 hours), but at
least compiles and runs on a 2x box, so it can't be that bad. I hope
it helps.
