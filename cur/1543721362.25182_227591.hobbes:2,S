This should happen on the timescale of two weeks.  I've got a 9500 series
controller on hand and some SATA disks on order. Once the disks arrive,
with Adam's help it shouldn't take me long to get smartmontools working on
the 9500 series controllers.
The most novel aspect is that this will use the driver's character device
interface rather than the block interface.
Cheers,
