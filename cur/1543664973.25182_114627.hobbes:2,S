That's similar to what you posted to LKML a while ago, and
it has the limitations of requiring mountable /dev/fd0, which
needs a magic entry in /etc/fstab ("user" privs, not "owner"),
and MS-DOS FS support in the kernel used for the build.
Those are the limitations I want to avoid. Do put this in a script
in the kernel, but please allow the user to override it via $PATH.
