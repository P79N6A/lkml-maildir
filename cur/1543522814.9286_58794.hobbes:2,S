Have a look at the bootmem stuff, escp. reserve_bootmem()
It can be done during __setup time. Not __initcall, since
by then the bootmem is frozen.

To bad, else you could have used the bigphysarea patch...
Maybe we can augment this patch with a startregion? The
size is already given...

As far as I can see, it's just memory ala kmalloc(), only
with the exception you shouldn't kfree() it :)
So the usual stuff like virt_to_bus() before DMA applies.
