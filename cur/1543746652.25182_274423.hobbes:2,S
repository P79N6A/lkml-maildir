Jeff,
so the fact still remains: what is so bad about the current approach.
sure -- it can't do wire-rate 1GbE with minimal sized frames -- but even if 
it could -- would it be able to do bidirectional 1GbE with minimal sized 
frames?
even if you could, can you name a real-world application that would 
actually need that?
you make the point of "these things are necessary for 10GbE".
sure, but -- again -- 10GbE NICs are typically an entirely different beast, 
with far more offload, RAM , DMA & on-board firmware capabilities.
take a look at any of the 10GbE adapters, either already released, 
announced, or in development.  they all go well beyond 1GbE NICs for 
embedded smarts; they have to.
the ability to wire-rate minimum-packet-size 10GbE is still not going to be 
something that any real-world app (that i can think of) requires.
10GbE wire-rate is in the order of ~14.88 million packets/second.  that 
works out to approximately 1 packet every 67 nanoseconds.
cheers,
lincoln.
