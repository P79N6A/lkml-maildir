LS,
For those who can't life without it, there is a version for
2.3.34+ kernels on my website:
	
http://www.polyware.nl/~middelin/En/hobbies.html
or for the dutch inclined:
	
http://www.polyware.nl/~middelin/hobbies.html
It's bootmem based, so it should work for lots of archs...
Also, due to the new infrastructure, totaly non-intrusive!
(though a little documenation explaining alloc_bootmem can
not be used during __initcall() time, but /can/ be used
during __setup() time would saved me some exploiring deepkernel)
    Met vriendelijke groet,
        Pauline Middelink
