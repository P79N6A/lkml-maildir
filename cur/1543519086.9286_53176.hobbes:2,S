      Again, the point that is missed is that for all you "unix hacker guru
      types" having to do "set meta-on" an such in a /.inputrc file may not be
      a big deal, but end user customers are lazy and don't want to do a weeks
      worth of research just to get their displays to look like what they are
      used to with NetWare, DOS, NT, Windows 95/98, etc.  I know you guys
      think I'm anal here or something, but I am trying to make this easy for
      our folks who will buy a Caldera or RedHat commercial Linux and the
      stuff just works without the user needing to do all this extra stuff to
      get what they can get "free and easy" from Microsoft and Novell (like
      simple text graphics support for utilities).

Have you ever been on a clients winblows machine and had to telnet to a
unix box and run a job with ansi graphics and the only telnet tool available
was the msdosbox? Obviously not.
