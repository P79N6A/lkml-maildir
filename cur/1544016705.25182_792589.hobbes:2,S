Reading splice_direct_to_actor() I see nothing wrong with the patch
(Patch is about splice from socket to pipe, while the sd->flags you mention
in splice_direct_to_actor() only applies to the splice from internal pipe to
something else, as splice_direct_to_actor() allocates an internal pipe to perform
its work.
Also, the meaning of SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK, as explained in include/linux/splice.h is :
#define SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK (0x02) /* don't block on the pipe splicing (but */
	/* we may still block on the fd we splice */
	/* from/to, of course */
If the comment is still correct, SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK only applies to the pipe implied in
splice() syscall.
For the other file, either its :
- A regular file : nonblocking mode is not available, like a normal read()/write() syscall
- A socket : We should be able to specify if its blocking or not, independantly from
             the SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK flag that only applies to the pipe. Normal way
             is using ioctl(FIONBIO) or other fcntl() call to change file->f_flags O_NONBLOCK
In order to be able to efficiently use splice() from a socket to a file, we need
to do a loop of :
{
splice(from blocking tcp socket to non blocking pipe, SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK); /* nonblocking pipe or risk deadlock */
splice(from pipe to file)
}
