GIT 0.99.8e is available as usual at:
    RPMs and tarball: www.kernel.org:/pub/software/scm/git/
    Debs and tarball: www.kernel.org:/pub/software/scm/git/debian/
The "master" branch has updated "git-diff-*" commands, that deal
with pathnames with funny characters (most importantly tabs and
newlines) in a way compatible with the proposed change to GNU
patch, which was outlined in:
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=git&m=112927316408690&w=2
When people start generating diffs with them, patches that touch
paths that have double-quotes '"' or spaces ' ' in them need to
be applied with the updated git-apply that knows how new
"git-diff-*" encodes these funny pathnames.  GIT 0.99.8e
contains the necessary backport of the git-apply changes.
This will hopefully be the last 0.99.8 maintenance release.
