The error goes way up when you do such calculations.  Not that most battery
hardware reports SBS Error margins right, but still...
So doing conversions is not a good idea unless it is from Ah to Coulombs or
something else like that which is an exact conversion.
In ThinkPads, you just need to compare what the various "let's calculate it"
applets say, and the output of tp_smapi (gets remanining time data directly
from the hardware) to see which one is more accurate :-)  And the difference
is often quite expressive.
