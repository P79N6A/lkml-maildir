Let's do it again.
Could you please describe how struct ioat_dma_chan channels are freed?
For example when device is removed just after it has been added.
ioat_probe() -> enumerate_dma_channels() (failures are ok now) ->
kmalloc a lot of channels.
ioat_remove() -> dma_async_device_unregister() which does not cleanup
ioat_dma_chan channels, but only clients.
It ends up in dma_async_device_cleanup() only.
