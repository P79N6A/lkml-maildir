Moving the current slim-line udelay() out of line would save 41 Kbytes
of text in the generic vmlinux, plus making any modules that use
udelay smaller too. Savings run from a 128-160 bytes for drivers
with just one call to a max of 9 Kbytes for qla2xxx.ko.
Being out-of-line would reduce accuracy, but this would only be
significant when the sleep is for a very small number of microseconds.
So if we need to add more code to udelay(), I think that it
should be moved out-of-line too (into arch/ia64/kernel/time.c).
alpha, m68knommu, powerpc and sh64 already have out of line udelay().
