I think that's what Stephen is saying.  The issue is, the "trusted."
handler uses CAP_SYS_ADMIN internally, after any other LSM check has
already occurred.  And the capable() check is too simple to know things
like which inode's xattr is in question at the moment or which namespace.
So Stephen was suggesting moving it out of the handler and putting it
in core code.
