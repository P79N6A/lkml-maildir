indeed this seems to be a driver related timer: driver/net/sis900.c's
sis900_timer() function. This timer polls your network card for link
status once every second. The mdio_read() function does alot of in/out
instructions which are quite slow.
could you try the following and disable mdio_delay():
	#define mdio_delay() do { } while (0)
normally it should work just fine. Worst-case you'd get a non-working
network driver. Does this change reduce the latency?
