Andre, Alan,
My grand total experience with IDE drivers is now around 4 hours.
I have no clue what's right or wrong and am quite clueless what the
role of apmd is wrt ide-disk driver. I'm open to testing other fixes
for this problem.
AFAIK, this could be a BIOS bug since no one else seems to have run into
on other laptops and it's reproduce with two different makes of drives. 
The reason I put the fix in the read/multwrite_intr path is the recovery
has to occur before the I/O is retried and before accessing the disk.
If multmode can be set before even trying the I/O, then that's definitely
a better solution. I just have no clue how to implement it.
thanks,
grant
