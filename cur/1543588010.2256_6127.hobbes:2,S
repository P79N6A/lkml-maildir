Well, as this device is already configured by the bios, I just tried
to load it giving the right IO port, and got the following message:
lunix:/home/schabi# modprobe aha1542 io=0x330
/lib/modules/2.4.3/kernel/drivers/scsi/aha1542.o: invalid parameter parm_io
/lib/modules/2.4.3/kernel/drivers/scsi/aha1542.o: insmod
/lib/modules/2.4.3/kernel/drivers/scsi/aha1542.o failed
/lib/modules/2.4.3/kernel/drivers/scsi/aha1542.o: insmod aha1542 failed
It seems as the driver doesn't accept a given IO port as parameter.
Using isapnptools (which I never had to use before), I got the following
error message:
lunix:~# isapnp pnpconfig.txt
Board 1 has Identity 08 0f 6d b9 45 42 15 90 04:  ADP1542 Serial No 258849093 [checksum 08]
pnptext:60 -- Fatal - IO range check attempted while device activated
pnptext:60 -- Fatal - Error occurred executing request '<IORESCHECK> ' --- further action aborted
/proc/isapnp also states that the device is active, but no ports, irq, dma
and memory is mapped.
I put the pnpconfig.txt and the contents of /proc/isapnp also onto
http://schabi.de/scsi/.
In some other tests, I compiled the kernel without Plug and Play support.
The module loaded without any parameters (and didn't accept an parm_io
value) when typing modprobe aha1542. As expected by me, it didn't make
any difference whether I told my bios that there's an pnp-OS installed or
not, as the Host adapter is a bootable device and so initialized both
ways.  Pnpdump had the same output, as far as I saw.
I also retried a statically compiled driver (no module) without isapnp
(the combination my 2.2.19 kernel used), and it also worked as expected.
So this is clearly a isapnp triggered problem.
Another point: I compile my kernel with the debian command "make-kpkg
kernel-image", and then install the created kernel .deb - I hope this
doesn't make any difference with my problem.
