Sounds like it's referring to micro-architectural reordering, which is
distinct from compiler reordering.  In other words, even if you
specified "-mvolatile-asm-stop" I would assume that the compiler could
still reorder the asm statements.  Am I right, or should I read more
into the manual description than it actually says?
