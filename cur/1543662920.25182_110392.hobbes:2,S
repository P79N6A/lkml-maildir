[snipped out patch discussion]
I think if the patch and the features talked about are included in the
kernel we'll have (names are not correct)
CONFIG_LOGO=y/n
CONFIG_LOGO_XRES=128
CONFIG_LOGO_YRES=64
CONFIG_LOGO_BPP=8
CONFIG_LOGO_PATH="" # (/usr/src/linux/.../logo/tux.pnm)
CONFIG_LOGO_POS_X="left|center|right"  # or absolute ?
CONFIG_LOGO_POS_Y="top|center|bottom"  # like X windows +110,+200 ?
CONFIG_LOGO_BGCOL=#ef0000              # depends on bpp of framebuffer... 
I think this would be enough for all and possible implementable for the
developers..or am I wrong ?
Greetings,
Nico
