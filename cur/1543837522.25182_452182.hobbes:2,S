Patch your "Linux" to dump the output of "strace" of the init scripts
(it should be enough to improve the correct line in /etc/inittab) into a
log file and have fun considering the heuristics to be used in the
kernel to detect the dependencies.
AFAIK typical init scripts, the expression "extremely hard" is the
understatement of the year for this task.
