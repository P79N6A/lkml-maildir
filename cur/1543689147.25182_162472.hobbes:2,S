What I've been seeing lately is people complaining it used to work with
previous kernels but later ones don't. One possible explanation would be
that VIA chip sets (explicitly or through one of their specific properties)
used to be blacklisted before (and thus APIC silently disabled).
The reports I get indicate that _something_ in the kernel changed. I
suspect it's the ACPI code (best viewed with Intel chipsets), but that's
speculation.
