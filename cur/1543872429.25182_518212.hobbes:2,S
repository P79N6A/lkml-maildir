Not strictly; but folk do so, and the results are compatible-enough
for many purposes.  Certainly a quick glance at i2c-algo-bit tells
me that it knows how to cope with output-only SCL.  A generic GPIO
driver "should" be able to at least act sanely given such a pin.

Not necessarily ... reading the GPIO pad state works regardless of what
direction was configured on most chips (including AT91 and AVR32), but
not all of them.
Certainly multi-drive/open-drain outputs get the electical stuff right
without that.  Russell's explanation says the reason to switch direction
is to disable the non-open-drain output drivers.
There are several options lurking, that a generic I2C bitbanger "ought"
to handle.  Existence of open-drain outputs is one issue.  Ability to
change direction is another; as is ability to read the value on output
pads.  Your code assumed one set of answers; others are possible.

As I said in a different way above!  If open drain outputs are available,
and the actual values can be read on output pins, then I think both pins
can be configured as outputs and left that way.

Reading the code, I see it's automatic if you don't provide getscl()...
