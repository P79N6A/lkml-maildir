	To enable cx88-alsa, you need to have alsa enabled at kernel.
	Not all devices supports digital audio on cx2388x. There's a bit at
board's eeprom specifying if digital audio is provided by the board. If
this bit is set, you will see 1741:8801 or 1741:8811 with lspci -n.
If your device doesn't show these numbers, the module will not work.

	This is not a kernel question. Anyway, tvtime config file have a field
specifying which input line is selected.

	We need more info about this, like video and audio standard, audio mode
(mono, stereo, sap), what device, dmesg. Please provide these info to
v4l ml and we will be happy to help you.
