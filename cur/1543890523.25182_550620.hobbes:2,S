Hello,
   I have question, probably for Richard. Why is 
/sys/class/leds/whatsoever/brightness mode set to 0644? Is it really necessary?
I feel like I'll be happy to allow anybody to change the state of this led. (Ok 
this maybe doesn't apply to other leds)

I have the impression that the led subsystem doesn't actually count with 
possibility to have more then one device of one type, right? In my case there 
can by lots of pads, so I made it on my own, using counter. Is it ok?
Thanks
