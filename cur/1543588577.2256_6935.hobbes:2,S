Subject: 2.2.19: inconsistency between sys_utime and sys_utimes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

In fs/open.c I see the following code in sys_utime in case the struct
utimbuf * is NULL:
		if (current->fsuid != inode->i_uid &&
		    (error = permission(inode,MAY_WRITE)) != 0)
			goto dput_and_out;
In sys_utimes, there is a similar piece of code in case the struct
timeval * is NULL:
		if ((error = permission(inode,MAY_WRITE)) != 0)
			goto dput_and_out;
Is this intentional?
I'm very much a newbie with respect to the kernel internals, but I
observe the following behavior: calling `touch' on my own file on an
NFS mounted directory works nicely.  However, if I don't own the file,
only have write permissions to it and the containing directory due to
being in the right group and the file (and directory) having g+w
permissions, then I see this:

Note how utime tells me the operation is not permitted, yet:

... I can write to the file because I'm in the right group.
This behavior seems counter-intuitive.
Thanks,
