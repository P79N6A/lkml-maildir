Hi,
  (Linux/Alpha on LX, EV56)
  On 2.3.99-pre2-5, but not 2.3.99-pre1, if I bring up the Gnome window
manager selection box the machine hangs.  It looks like the window manager
goes first, and if I come in from a remote box, ps hangs half way through
the process list.  Keyboard still works (I sysrq-s,u, b).
(This is with XFree 4.0)
(Sorry that is hardly localised).
On the point of sysrq-u; it didn't seem to be unmounting the filesystems
cleanly.
  On a separate note if I try and use DRI versions of X DRM/DRI code is
getting an unhandled kernel paging request (to 0) in drm_release. 
Dave
