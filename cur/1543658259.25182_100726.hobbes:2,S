I get them from the network stack, and I supposed they're guaranteed to be 
in ZONE_NORMAL as long as the adapter doesn't list NETIF_F_HIGHDMA among 
its features. So yes, you're right that it will probably work with PAE, 
but it won't work with a real 64-bit box, methinks.

I was kinda busy and didn't get a chance to do much with the driver over 
the last 10 months or so... I also didn't have any boxes which could do 
real PAE, so I didn't try very hard -- until recently, that is. :-)

A few of these are mostly normal, it's the card signalling the driver that 
it is getting a Tx fifo underrun, and the driver responds by increasing 
the threshold at which the card starts transmitting the packet.

These are very high, however; it could be that there really is very high
contention on the PCI bus, but otherwise I can't explain them.
If they stop before reaching 1500, then it's probably ok and just
something you're gonna have to live with. Otherwise it's a bug of some
sort.

Yeah, the interrupt status (printed right after the messages) would have 
been helpful...
That said, there is a known race condition in the v1.3.6 of the driver,
which could cause timeouts and erors under certain circumstances. It's all
fixed in 1.3.9 (the full 64-bit support version) and 1.4.0 (NAPI support). 
Both of those will do real 64-bit transfers, without the need for double 
buffering, so it should help on your 16GB boxes.
I could forward you one of those versions, if you want to test it. In 
fact, I'd appreciate some testing! :-)
Thanks,
Ion
