Hello,
I'm interested in making a driver for the Kinesis Savant Elite Programable
USB Foot Switches[1]. Is there any way for me to check that such driver
doesn't exists already? I've searched a bit on the internet and I couldn't
find anything, but if there's somewhere else to look at before learning how
to make a driver and all that, it would be helpful.
Thank you.
