1) I sent this patch bypassing the arch maintainer, so I made it as
simple as possible, just moved the byteorder.h's and changed the
names of the arch-overrides.
2) If you'd care to check, this file is not exported to userspace, so
I can't possible trigger that warning.
3) It's already in Linus' tree, so it's a bit hard for me to change it
now ;-)
