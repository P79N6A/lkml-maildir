Ext2 and ext3 both do this already (with caveats).  Since ext2 doesn't
impose write ordering constraints, there is not a hard guarantee that
the data block makes it to disk before the metadata is updated.  If
you run ext3 in data=ordered or data=journal mode, then you do have
such a guarantee. 
If you run in data=writeback mode, you basically have the same
situation as ext2 (data may be written before or after the metadata).
This is the same as the _current_ reiserfs code, but there are
apparently patches available which allow data=ordered mode also.
Cheers, Andreas
