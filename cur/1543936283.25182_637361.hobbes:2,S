>>The test command is:
>>#sudo taskset -c 7 ./netserver
>>#sudo taskset -c 0 ./netperf -t TCP_RR -l 60 -H 127.0.0.1 -i 50,3 -I 99,5 -- -r 1,1
A couple of comments/questions on the command lines:
*) netperf/netserver support CPU affinity within themselves with the 
global -T option to netperf.  Is the result with taskset much different? 
   The equivalent to the above would be to run netperf with:
./netperf -T 0,7 ...
The one possibly salient difference between the two is that when done 
within netperf, the initial process creation will take place wherever 
the scheduler wants it.
*) The -i option to set the confidence iteration count will silently cap 
the max at 30.
happy benchmarking,
