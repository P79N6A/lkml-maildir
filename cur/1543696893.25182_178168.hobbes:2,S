Seems so. I assume you missed the "bandwidth constraint" part. Fetching
a whole snapshot every day is not even close to workable. The snapshots
in patch form are nice however patching forth and back is not really an
option. If svn doesn't get back up I'd be tempted to use rsync and use
vendor branches in my own SVN repository but this also seems far from
optimal to me. rsync alone doesn't cut it because there's no version
management and I've lost quite a few patches due to an not thoroughly
considered rsync use.
