I've got a patch which reinitializes sched domains at cpu hotplug time. 
We need something like this on ppc64 for partitioned systems (we run
into the same issue when adding a cpu which wasn't present at boot).  I
had been waiting to post it until some cpu hotplug issues with preempt
were solved, but it seems it would help the case of hotplugging
secondary cpus at boot, so I'll submit that soon.
