../drivers/block/ide.c, line 162, on version 2.2.17 does bad things
to the timer. It writes 0 to the control-word for timer 0. This
does the following:
o	Selects timer 0.
o	Latches the timer.
o	Selects mode 0.
o	Programs it to a 16 bit counter.
The result is a latched (stopped) counter. Bits 5 and 4 should have been
selected. Then you read bits 0-7 from 0x40, followed by bits 8-15  from
the same port.
Also, there is no spin-lock protecting access to these ports. If anybody
else is mucking with the timer, all bets are off.
Cheers,
