We will not get all architectures converted in 48 hours or even 72.
kbuild 2.5 has been available for months and only i386, ia64, sparc32
(I did all those) and sparc64 (Ben Collins) have been converted.  Alpha
is in progress.  Unconverted architectures stay on 2.5.2-pre1 until
they do the conversion, but there is no need to hold up everybody else.
