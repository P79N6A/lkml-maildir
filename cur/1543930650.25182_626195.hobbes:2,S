Which saves the initial target, for ease of accounting at end io time -
that's not the point. What happens when ->make_request_fn() changes
bio->bi_bdev and returns 1, causing another iteration of the
__generic_make_request() loop? 'q' is no longer the valid target,
bdev_get_queue(bio->bi_bdev) is.

Or you could try and make an effort to understand the comment instead of
just glancing over it.
