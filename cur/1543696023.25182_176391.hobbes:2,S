The downside to ACPI is that it's a complex standard, and with complexity 
comes the inevitable bugs. As you just found out, it does a lot more than 
just power control (the "C" is for "Configuration").
On some machines the ACPI support is even more broken than other BIOS 
tables, but it's getting better.
