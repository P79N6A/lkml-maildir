True.  For the old ppc code, the problem occurs with any other signal
as well, but the signal stack problem is specific to SIGSEGV and
possibly SIGBUS, depending on architecture.

That would be optimal, yes.  This external core dump signal doesn't
exist yet, does it?

Correct.  The userspace will have bugs and it will have plenty.  The
interesting question is only, if we can gather enough debugging data
to identify and fix those bugs, when they occur.  This is embedded, no
user is going to narrow down the problem.
