Subject: [RFC] Regulator: Push lock out of _notifier_call_chain + add voltage change event.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Jonathan Cameron <jic23@cam.ac.uk>
Regulator: Push lock out of _notifier_call_chain and into caller functions
(side effect of fixing deadlock in regulator_force_disable)
+ Add a voltage changed event.
Signed-off-by: Jonathan Cameron <jic23@cam.ac.uk>
---
Follow up to Mark Brown's suggestion of moving the regulator lock out
of the notifier code.  This avoids cases where it was previously necessary
to unlock the regulator before notification occured.
Any scenarios where this will cause trouble?
I'll do a documentation patch when we've pinned down how to do this.
+ can break the patch into one for pushing the lock out and one for
adding the event.
