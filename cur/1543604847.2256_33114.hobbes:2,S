Sure, I was holding off on a cc to linux-kernel because I really don't like
it though ;-)  This is the LVM locking patch, so before making a snapshot
LVM wants to flush the FS and block new transactions.
LVM does this:
lockfs(dev) ;
make snapshot
unlockfs(dev) ;
This can happen while dev is either mounted or unmounted.  If dev was
unmounted when the lockfs was called, I'd like to make sure nobody can
mount it before the unlockfs is done.  I did this with a new semaphore in
fs/super.c, but I'd rather find something cleaner...
