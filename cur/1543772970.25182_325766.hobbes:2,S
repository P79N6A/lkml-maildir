Well it seems to me that all the XFS code does is check to see if the FS
is in a shutdown state really early in the call path. Adding a
super->s_errno or MS_ABORTED flag (i prefer the former, for flexibility)
to the VFS level to be checked before calling into the filesystem would
add the consistent behavior to all filesystems.
As far as the ReiserFS support goes, I was premature in stating that
ReiserFS supports behavior 1b. It does so in terms of journal errors,
but it does just warn and continue on other errors. I'm working on a
patch that introduces reiserfs_error() similar to ext3_error() that
replaces the warnings in many places. The behavior is configurable using
the mount options introduced with the i/o error patches.
