Hi again...
now i shoould have exactly the same settings as you, (can be checked at
ftp://yoda.u-strasbg.fr/pub/erm7-kernel2.4-test9.config
) and still,
i get the message 
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_lostirq func only : 13
.......
i have put the output of dmesg for 2.2.17 under
ftp://yoda.u-strasbg.fr/pub/erm7-dmesg...
since i was not able to save the kernel messages from the 2.4 kernels
(BTW is there a way, besides copying on paper??)
looking at them i saw that there are differences in the messages, on
kernel2.4 it starts with a driver ID i haven't on 2.2 kernels:
Uniform Multiplatform E-IDE driver rev 6.31
ide: assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO Modes, ....
then the same messages as in 2.2.17:
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 19
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xfcd0-0xfcd7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
then another line not in 2.2:
ide0: BM-DMA at <some address> BIOS settings hda: DMA hdb: pio
and last as in 2.2:
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: IBM-DJSA-210, 9590MB w/384kB Cache, CHS=1299/240/63, UDMA
with the difference on the last line:
hda: 1964080 Sectors w/384kB Cache, CHS=1299/240/63, UDMA(33)
(i had to write fast, an even after several reboots this isn't easy, BTW
<ctrl>Q/S do not seem to work to stop the flow...
As a reminder, system is a laptop, trying to cold-boot a
linux-system....
it is very depressing that the system ran fine under all kernels since
now, and that the newest near stable kernels aren't running at all....
seems as if i will to have stay stuck all times to 2.2 kernels....
