You are going to run into some actual scheduling conflicts. A relatively
low CPU/memory program can generate I/O which can flood an I/O channel. To
avoid the flood, that program will have to be suspended... and that might
result in a high idle time. The schedular must know not to run that
program and that the idle time is for the "best". That I/O flood will be a
problem only if there are contending programs which also need to do I/O on
that channel.
That suggests to me a more inclusive scheduler which handles resource
contention beyond just CPU and memory.
