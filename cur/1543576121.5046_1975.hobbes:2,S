How about using a sentinel list entry representing the current position
in run_task_queue's loop?
The sentinel's next pointer isn't invalidated by other operations on the
list, provided each operation is protected by tqueue_lock.  Each
iteration step is a matter or removing the sentinel, and inserting it in
the next position.  A task removing itself would then be perfectly ok.
