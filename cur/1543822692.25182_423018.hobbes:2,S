If you mean the disk cache is reliable with the battery, then it should be done by the block layer that a write barrier doesn't
translate into a SYNC (or whatever it is called). Instead, data is considered synced to disk as soon as it hits the cache.
It's really nothing to do with EXT3. It's doing the right thing.
