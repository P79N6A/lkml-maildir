Install a 2.4 kernel with apm enabled and use that.
That's serious, I have an IBM, Tecra, Dell, and Acer, and 5-6 friends 
running Linux on laptops. Every one (other than the Acer) works with 
"apm -s" and recovers. Some work with "apm -S". The Acer never had a 2.4 
kernel, and I haven't rebuilt with apm on 2.6 (or even looked to see if 
it was supported). All of these suspend fine with ACPI, none ever wakes up.
Is suspend even supposed to be generally functional? I thought it was a 
WIP not expected to work except on certain models which have been hand 
tuned by the developers. In fact I have a message somewhere saying you 
have to get out of X to a text console, manually shutdown the network, 
and then it might work. Then start everything up again.
