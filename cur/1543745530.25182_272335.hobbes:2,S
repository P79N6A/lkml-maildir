You lack CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE maybe ? You should use the
pmac_defconfig ... Now, if controlfb still doesn't work, then I'll have
to dig out my old 8500, it's possible that the recent changes to the
fbdev layer broke some of those old drivers.
As for serial, check out CONFIG_SERIAL_PMACZILOG and
CONFIG_SERIAL_PMACZILOG_CONSOLE.

Yes, that is due to the 2.6 changes in fbdev/fbcon, the loss of the per
VT mode data structure, the driver is now sort-of supposed to re-invent
a mode based on bogus stuff sent by fbcon on console switch. I don't
like it much, but I suppose I'll have to fix controlfb (and platinumfb
etc...).
