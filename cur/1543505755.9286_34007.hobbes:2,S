It depends of course on what your definition of "on the network" is. 
Do you read comp.risks? Some Win9x machines come with preinstalled
ActiveX components that are exploitable. Several versions of MTA's
have MIME overflows etc. Then there is of course the trojan horses,
macro virusses etc that are not a monopoly of Win9x but are certainly
more widespread there.
Win9x machines are opening up towards the net and their current track
record isn't very good either. Has anybody ever checked those networks
aware games for overflows?
If Barclays is really that concerned about password theft they should
use technology that doesn't require you to use enter a password
directly into the computer at all, such as a separate "calculator". 
My bank does.
