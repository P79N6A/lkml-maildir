Frequency adjustments just means an adjustment of the scaling factor.
Am I missing something?

I am not sure what NTP behavior needs to be fudged. Sorry about my limited
NTP knowledge. Could you elaborate on what the problem is?

Yes. 128bit would be great for this. 64bit is fine though as
far as I can see and allows granularity up to fractions of
nanoseconds if applied between 1ms intervals.

I think these could all be taken into account by a scaling factor off a
certain base established at a tick-like event that does the ntp scaling.
The scaling between tick-like event needs to be just a scaling factor for
performance reasons.
