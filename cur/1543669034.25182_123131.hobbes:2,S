Subject: correct to set -nostdinc and then include <stdarg.h> ?

I was trying to compile 2.5.66 with gcc 3.2.2.  It dies as soon as it tries to 
compile init/main.c because it is unable to find "stdarg.h" which is included by 
"include/linux/kernel.h".
The "-nostdinc" flag is set in the compile options.  If I remove that flag, that 
particular file appears to compile fine.
It seems wrong to tell the compiler to not look in the standard places but then 
include a standard file.  Am I missing something?
Other compiler versions work fine, so I'm guessing the compiler now interprets 
the flag more strictly than before.
What is the proper way to deal with this?
Chris
