Subject: [-mm PATCH] time: i386 clocksource drivers - drop acpi_pm_buggy paranoia
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/3/305

	As pointed out by Adrian Bunk, I was a bit paranoid with the acpi_pm.c
code and included code to work around buggy chipset's acpi pm
implementations. Andi Kleen convinced me that its not worth punishing
all systems for it, so I left the code disabled thinking I'd re-enable
it via a DMI blacklist when problematic systems surfaced. However, since
the code is not enabled, this removes it from the patch, as it can be
easily re-added if such a system does show up.
thanks
