Hi!

See FAQ:
Q: How do I make suspend more verbose?
A: If you want to see any non-error kernel messages on the virtual
terminal the kernel switches to during suspend, you have to set the
kernel console loglevel to at least 4 (KERN_WARNING), for example by
doing
        # save the old loglevel
        read LOGLEVEL DUMMY < /proc/sys/kernel/printk
        # set the loglevel so we see the progress bar.
        # if the level is higher than needed, we leave it alone.
        if [ $LOGLEVEL -lt 5 ]; then
                echo 5 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
                fi
        IMG_SZ=0
        read IMG_SZ < /sys/power/image_size
        echo -n disk > /sys/power/state
        RET=$?
        #
        # the logic here is:
        # if image_size > 0 (without kernel support, IMG_SZ will be
zero),
        # then try again with image_size set to zero.
        if [ $IMG_SZ -ne 0 ]; then # try again with minimal image size
                echo 0 > /sys/power/image_size
                echo -n disk > /sys/power/state
                RET=$?
        fi
        # restore previous loglevel
        echo $LOGLEVEL > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
        exit $RET
