Oops. I completely misread the ->cpus_allowed check in try_to_wake_up(), and
so workqueue_cpu_callback() needs a simple fix: CPU_UP_CANCELED should rebind
cwq->thread. Or, better, we should not bind the task until CPU_ONLINE.
I'll send the patch soon, but it conflicts with Rafael's
	add-suspend-related-notifications-for-cpu-hotplug.patch
, so I am sending this cleanup first to make them independent.
Actually, I believe almost all subsystems could be simplified as well, most
of them don't care about CPU_TASKS_FROZEN bit.
