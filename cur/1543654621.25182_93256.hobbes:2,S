Hallo. I have 3CCFE575BT pcmcia network card in my Compaq Armada 7360 DMT.
It dies after suspend with the following messages:
 eth0: command 0x5800 did not complete! Status=0xffff
 eth0: command 0x2804 did not complete! Status=0xffff
Machine is almost blocked during these messages and I need to replug it.
It is really annoying. Donald Becker told me, this is a bug in PCMCIA
code, so I've posted this message here.
P.S. If there will be any answers, please CC me, because I'm not 
subscribed to the list.
