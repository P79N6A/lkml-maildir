Hi,
When I try to mount a device of type iso9660
(Either a CD ROM or a iso image), my machine
cannot access any more devices. It works for
a while as along as everything it needs to access
is already in memory. But as soon as it tries to
access the harddrive, it hangs.
Is anyone else having this problem?
