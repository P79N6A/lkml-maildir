Subject: [PATCH] Xmon bug fix for soft-reset
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/3/7

From: Haren Myneni <haren@us.ibm.com>
For soft reset during system hang, got an error "CPU did not take 
control" for some CPUs even though they responded to soft-reset (called 
SystemReset, die and called debugger - xmon).   First these CPUs entered 
into xmon by IPI callback and then got a soft-reset exception and 
re-entered into xmon again. The first CPU which re-entered into xmon got 
the output lock and made into xmon successfully without unlocking. 
Hence, the next CPU(s) which re-entered into xmon try to acquire a lock  
(get_output_lock). Therefore, we can not view state of those CPU(s).
[This is a simple, very low risk, obvious fix for an obvious bug, and
should go into 2.6.13.  -- paulus]
