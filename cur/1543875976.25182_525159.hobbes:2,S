The problem could also be something other than SMM, like DMA
starvation by a video or disk controller.  Try disabling all hard
drive controllers and booting from a CD or USB stick.
Also, try tweaking the expire_centisecs and writeback_centisecs values
in /proc/sys/vm and see if it changes the period of the glitches.
