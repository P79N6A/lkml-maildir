Right.  You dont have O_DIRECT for NFS and you control the
application.  You need O_STREAMING.  Or posix_fadvise(), which
would be significantly harder to use and is not really implementable
in 2.4.
Any magical kernel voodoo which reads your mind and drops that
cache early would probably help, but there's no way in which it
can be as effective as an explicit hint.
