That's only a valid fix if there are no other filesystems, and no
other places in ext2, where we can call GFP with locks which prevent a
put_inode from being incurred.  And with the quota case to consider,
you have to avoid calling GFP with a lock against quota file writes
too (and since quota writes may GFP, this would deadlock if there was
any form of serialisation on the quota file).  This feels like rather
a lot of new and interesting deadlocks to be introducing so late in
2.4.  :-)
Cheers,
 Stephen
