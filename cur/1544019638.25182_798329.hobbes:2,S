Okay, so yeah, they definitely both have model_id == 0.
firewire_sbp2: Workarounds for fw2.0: 0x48 (firmware_revision 0x0a2700, 
model_id 0x000000).
On a related note... The fix capacity workaround... I think I need to
observe this failure myself... My own 4th-gen ipod, when connected to a
Mac OS X system, reports the exact capacity I get if the fix capacity
workaround is disabled. Do they just know not to try to access that
last block, or is the need for this workaround a myth? :)
