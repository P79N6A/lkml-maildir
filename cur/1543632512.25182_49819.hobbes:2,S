Philippe has done some preliminary testing with dbench/tbench and
he got something like < 1%. Of course, more testing is required.

Alessandro's answer is to the point. Basically, grab the papers,
the code and the patent and have a look for yourself, you will see
that we're clear. Apart from having the kernels side-by-side,
Adeos is based on classic early '90s nanokernel work. No secrets
there.
