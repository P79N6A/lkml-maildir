True on all counts.  I guess it's a question of whether the lack of an easy
fallback path will significantly reduce the number of testers.  I don't have
enough of a feel to answer that.

So, when eth1394 is ported the name should be something like fw-ip, at least
if we are to remain consistent with the other 3 module names.

It certainly doesn't support the raw1394 API so its current usefulness is
extremely limited.

Precisely.  As I said, I've probably got a corner case and it's certainly
not worth the effort just for that.  It would be nice though.  You're right
about nosy; so long as nosy (which is independent of the firewire stack)
keeps working I'll be happy. :)
