Arl. You know I have programmed with UNIX for quite a while, but never
ran across this one. Thanx for the hint.

Hmmm ... As I said before, we have already a working, complete and
tested driver and you like to pass that over to the freeware
community. All that's missing is this little authorization thing. I
have seen your's dmaram.c driver, which is great for normal PCI DMA
style stuff (without AGP GART). What our little driver does, is simply
populating the GART, mapping CPU pages behind it, setting up essential
MTRR stuff and so on. There are a couple of neat tricks in it, that
work around a few problems in both graphics chips as well as
motherboard chips. After supporting now half a dozen graphics chip
families for HW 3D and AGP you realize that things don't always work
as the databooks say ;-)
Who is the person to send a driver like this to ?
