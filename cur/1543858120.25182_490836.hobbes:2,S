Ok. On ppc, the issues are perhaps a bit more straightforward, because 
there is really just one way to do system calls: "sc".
That said, powerpc simply doesn't historically do any system call 
translation, so you'll just have to implement the same kind of translation 
layer that sparc has done, for example.
See: DoSyscall in arch/powerpc/kernel/entry_32.S. Right now it just does

ie it uses one global table ("sys_call_table" and "NR_syscalls") for 
everything, and you'd need to make it use different tables (and table 
sizes) conditionally on the "Apple binary flag"
Alternatively, you could perhaps fit it in the exception table itself 
(arch/powerpc/kernel/entry.S), but that gets just nastier and more 
low-level, so I doubt it's all that great an idea.

Yes. The big issue tends to be to translate all the errno's and the fcntl 
structure pointers etc. THAT can be quite painful indeed. You might ask 
David Miller and company about their SunOS stuff, and look at things like
	arch/sparc/kernel/{sys_sunos.c,sunos_ioctl.c}
for some sorry examples.

See above. "DoSyscall" is where you enter.
