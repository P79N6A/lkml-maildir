Hi Adrian,
I guess that the code below you have to include in the
fs/proc/task_nommu.c. But I would like to replicate the error you
found and apply the code below to verify if it is correct. So if you
can explain how you got this error I can test the code below. If you
want to test the code below by yourself, let me know about the result
please.
static int show_smap(struct seq_file *m, void *v)
{
	return 0;
}
struct seq_operations proc_pid_smaps_op = {
	.start	= m_start,
	.next	= m_next,
	.stop	= m_stop,
	.show	= show_smap
};
BR,
Mauricio Lin.
