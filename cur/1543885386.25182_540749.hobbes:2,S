I fully agree here. Yes, AC is common term, but might be really
confusing for people who really know what AC is. ;-)
In past review we tried to drop any point of confusions (we agreed to
separate capacity, charge and energy terms), and now we've found
another point: AC, DC, MAINS. So, let's again eliminate any possibility
of confusion, and name things with correct terms.
Thanks,
