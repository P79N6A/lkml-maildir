Hmm... you are right, but partly. If something is being used, people say
it's good, it works for a group of people who need it and suddenly someone
comes in and says 'hey, guys! That stuff is a lousy piece of code, bloat and
absolutely not necessary here - throw it away because it's bad!' then THAT
person has to prove he's right, correct?
