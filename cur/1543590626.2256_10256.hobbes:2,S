Subject: serial console broken in 2.4.4?

Hello,
I have noticed strange serial console behaviour in 2.4.4.
I have system with gettys on ttyS0 and tty1.
When I boot with usual console (set to tty1), getty on ttyS0 works.
When I boot with console set to ttyS0 ("console=ttyS0,9600n8"),
getty on ttyS0 doesnot respond on input (although ps shows it running);
all kernel messages are showed on ttyS0, but it seems that _input_ is
disallowed/broken. Things were okay somewhere around (AFAIR) 2.4.0pre..
Is this a known 2.4 bug? Any patch to fix this?
