That the date is no longer realistic is clear. What disappoints me is 
that you didn't mention in the changelog of 2.6.13-mm1 where I'd have 
noticed it.
It semms I need my own bookkeeping of patches I sent that are in -mm to 
notice when they get lost. The only positive side effect of this is that 
I can use this to push you harder to forward some patches of me to Linus 
that stay unforwarded in -mm for several months...
