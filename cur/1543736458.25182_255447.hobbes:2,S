Hello,
Recently while examining the Linux tty code I noticed that my
root password was still in read_buf some time after logging in,
long after it was "read".
I thought it might be a good idea to add a fix to clear out 
characters after they're read. The patch seems to work all right.
This is for kernel 2.6.8.1 and the file is drivers/char/n_tty.c.
Enjoy,
Z Smith
