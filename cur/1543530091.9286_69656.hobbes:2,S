>Does that really simply change make your keyboard come to life again?
I have been having a similar problem on a Gigabyte GA-5AX R4 motherboard
(
http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/gigabyte-web/products/ga5ax4.htm
). Usually
I'll loose the mouse/keyboard when switching between X and a console.
I've stopped using gpm to eliminate loosing the keyboard when I switch
to a console, but going back to X is always dangerous. 
After changing that line, and doing a few minutes worth of tests, the
fix seems to work. I even started gpm again to give it a better chance
at locking. So far, no locks. However, frequently X will "loose" the
mouse, but the keyboard is fine (which i dont' mind, and is prob fixable
by using gpm's redirection device). 
I'll keep testing, but so far it looks good!
