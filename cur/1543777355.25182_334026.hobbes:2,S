Well, Windoes 98 (vmmon) shows very different ones:
/dev/vmmon[4355]: host clock rate change request 0 -> 19
/dev/vmmon[4355]: host clock rate change request 19 -> 0
/dev/vmmon[4355]: host clock rate change request 0 -> 19
/dev/vmmon[4355]: host clock rate change request 19 -> 63
/dev/vmmon[4355]: host clock rate change request 63 -> 200
/dev/vmmon[4355]: host clock rate change request 200 -> 201
/dev/vmmon[4355]: host clock rate change request 201 -> 1001

I have seen some apps which seem to schedule themselves using some kind of
SCHED_FIFO and therefore seem to get good RT:
from an ini file...
  # This option determines the multi-tasking capabilities of WinDEU.
  # The priority determines the minimum number of milliseconds WinDEU
  # will work before giving control back to Windows.
  # For example, if you set it to 20, it means WinDEU will gives
  # back control to Windows approximately (at most) 50 times a second.
  # A value of 0 means WinDEU WON'T multi-task.
  # (Can be changed in the preferences dialog box.)
  BuildPriority=25
