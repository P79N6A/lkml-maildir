Let's consider the host 23.0.0.2 w/ subnet 255.255.255.0 (which is in the
network 23.0.0.0/24). From what I know about IP (which could be wrong, so 
please correct me if this is the case), we have:
- Host-number = 	0x02		(last 8 bits, as defined by subnet mask)
- Network-number = 	0x170000	(first 24 bits, as defined by the
					 subnet mask)
- Subnet-number = 	0xFFFFFF00
None of them is 0 or -1 and, thus, the IP address is valid.
I hope this clarifies your doubt. Be careful with name definitions ... ;)
