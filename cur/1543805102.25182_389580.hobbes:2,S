But where is this laid down in the standard? There must be some part
that defines this, else we cannot rely on it. The wording for malloc()
and mmap() or mlock() is different. One talks about address space and
mapping, whereas malloc() talks about "storage".
Only I haven't got time to look for it now. Just that Solaris happens to
do it doesn't make it a standard.
