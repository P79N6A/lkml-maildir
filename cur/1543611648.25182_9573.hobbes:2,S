Or for example the new HP PARISC design ( Mako ) with two on-die cores,
3-4 Mb L1 I-Cache per core, 3-4 Mb L1 D-Cache per core and up to 32 Mb
external L2 ( with on-die tagging ).
Anyway it's still better 8 on-die threads of execution sharing an L2
instead of 8 CPU with 1 thread of execution shring through the external
bus.
