That was the intent. :)

You certainly get my vote for that.  Consider, however, that sd_mod 
invents geometry numbers for whomever is silly enough to call 
HDIO_GETGEO, even though CHS doesn't make sense _at all_ on a SCSI disk, 
which never had that mode of addressing in the first place.  I wonder if 
there exists users of dmraid who have systems that can't do LBA?  (Seems 
unlikely though...)
Phillip... are you the person working on dmraid support in Ubuntu?  For 
the first time, I boot Ubuntu off that HostRAID array this afternoon 
without the need for a helper disk and with dmraid in the initramfs.  I 
appreciated the howto. :)
