I was wondering about that myself when looking at the code again.  I'm
not quite sure why we need to use the irq spinlock, since we already
make a local copy of jiffies so another timer IRQ changing the jiffies
value shouldn't affect the return value of get_jiffies64().  Then again,
that isn't exactly stuff I'm familiar with, so I could be totally
off-base here.
Cheers, Andreas
