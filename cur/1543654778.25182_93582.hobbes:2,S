Subject: 2.5.50 breaks pcmcia cards on (at least) Dell Latitude

2.5.49 found my Xircom Ethernet/Modem card and my wireless card just fine.
2.5.50 totally hosed up, threw errors on the Xircom:
PCI: Device 03:00.0 not available because of resource collisions
PCI: Device 03:00.1 not available because of resource collisions
and the pcmcia support wasn't able to get the wireless card to work either.
I got it working by reverting the 2.5.50 change to drivers/pcmcia/cardbus.c
Patch attached, but probably needs reviewing - I can see why you'd want
the if/continue around the device_register() and pci_insert_device() calls,
but don't understand why the if/continue was move higher in the code.
I've also filed this as bug 134 at bugme.osdl.org.
