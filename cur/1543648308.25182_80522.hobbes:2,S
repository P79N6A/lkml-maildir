Subject: 2.5.43 partition problems?

My patch below works OK for me for 2.5.42.  
However, it does NOT work for 2.5.43.  
With 2.5.43 only partitions are the 1st disk are seen,
(as is also the case with 2.5.42).  
The patch below fixes that for 2.5.42.  It does NOT
fix it for 2.5.43.  Something else is wrong with 2.5.43.
With the patch, the devices
are openable so the partition table can be read I think, but, with this
patch, all the partitions on all the disks show up as identical 
to the partitions on the first disk.
I have not yet tracked down the problem, but thought
I should mention it just to warn cciss users that their partition
tables for disks other than the 1st aren't right if they 
use this patch with 2.5.43.
