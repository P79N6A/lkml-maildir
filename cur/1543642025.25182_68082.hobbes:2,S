We're going cyclic. All over. I think I've made my point, and you've made 
yours. Yet I could live with my raid(s). IMO you can handle it all at the 
level of clueful hardware presenting virtual hardware to your OS.

I agree for more than a hundred percent. And I think the OS shouldn't have 
to bother with disk slicing where it's not necessary.

I've meant to say "physical disks". I'm happily aware of raid virtual disk 
resizing.

Enough time to back up the stuff.

I'm not talking about all the stuff that's on the market right now. I'm 
talking about the good stuff which we should evolve within the next few 
years in order to get proper support for our requirements.

I'm still talking about raid here.

My response is: don't watch the script work.
