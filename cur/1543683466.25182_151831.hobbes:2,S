Well, Chris is right, of course.
As I said, writing 44 to the command byte disables IRQ1.
So, the question is, who does that. Read the code:
We do i8042_init, detect a PS/2 keyboard/mouse controller, and call
i8042_port_register() first for mouse, then for keyboard.
This i8042_port_register() does
	serio_register_port(port);
and then happily reports
	printk(KERN_INFO "serio: i8042 %s port at %#lx,%#lx irq %d\n"
This serio_register_port(port) probes connected devices.
It calls atkbd_connect(), which calls atkbd_probe(), and
the latter fails.
Now atkbd_connect() does serio_close() which does
i8042_close() and we see
	i8042_ctr &= ~values->irqen;
	i8042_command(&i8042_ctr, I8042_CMD_CTL_WCTR);
that the IRQ is disabled.
So the culprit is the failing of atkbd_probe().
It does a ATKBD_CMD_GETID, but gets no answer, then a
ATKBD_CMD_SETLEDS, and that command fails.
It sends the 0xed, gets an ACK, sends the 0x00 and times out.
And it times out because atkbd_sendbyte has a timeout of 10 msec
while the reply came after 11 msec.
So, apart from other things you might try, it seems to me that
changing the timeout in atkbd_sendbyte from the 10000 that is
there to the 100000 that the comment implies, should help.

-         int timeout = 10000; /* 100 msec */
+         int timeout = 100000; /* 100 msec */
