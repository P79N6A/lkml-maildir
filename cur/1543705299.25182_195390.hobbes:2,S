Well, since most of the changes in the latest kernels involve
networking, trying it with various different network-adapters would be
interesting, and stress-testing the network-code in general.
If you have the hardware or a really good confidence, a recent
2.2-kernel to compare with and sufficient knowledge of C, have a look at
the network-drivers for a2065 and ariadne, both of which lack the
padding-fixes the other adapters have, since I didn't want to touch that
mess...
