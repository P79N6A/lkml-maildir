What the hell?
So instead of bringing something in that works, you bring something in
that does significantly less, and gives no savings on overhead or patch
complexity why?  So you can later come out and say "We're so great now
we've increased the randomization by tweaking one variable aren't we
cool!!!"?
Red Hat is all smoke and mirrors anyway when it comes to security, just
like Microsoft.  This just reaffirms that.
