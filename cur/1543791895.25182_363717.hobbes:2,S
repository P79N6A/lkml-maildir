I guess you mean external migration of a cpuset to different CPUs and
memory nodes via FILE_CPULIST and FILE_MEMLIST?

Why?  If someone calls into that library for a query, then that library can
call into the kernel to query the current state, no?  Are you assuming that
this library will wish to cache state which belongs to the kernel?

Well yes - in the presence of other processes dinking with a cpuset's
settings, such a library is always racy.  Unless it provides
kernel-triggered callbacks when something changes.  Or unless it does
locking.

Not sure I understand this, but if you're saying that maintaining state in
a single pace is good then yup.

Shouldn't all those files in cpusetfs be documented?
So what is the <undocumented> programming interface which you are proposing
here?
a) process writes a non-zero number to file "marker_pid" in cpusetfs. 
   Kernel remembers that the calling task "owns" the cpuset for updates.
b) cpuset updates proceed.  If a different task does an update, marker_pid
   gets cleared.
c) process reads "marker_pid" and if that's still equal to getpid(), we
   know that nobody raced with us.  If someone _did_ race with us, what? 
   re-read everything?
d) process writes zero to "marker_pid" to release the marker.
Given that you're developing a library to do all this, why not do proper
locking in userspace and require that all cpuset updates go via the
library?
Does this code work correctly if different threads stomp on each others'
toes?  I think so.
hm, cpuset_common_file_write() likes to return 0 for the number of bytes
written.  This could cause some userspace tools to hang, repeating the
write all the time, or to report a write error.  It should return nbytes on
success.
