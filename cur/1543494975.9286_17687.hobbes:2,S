When we did this at SGI, the wakeup1-on-accept as well as wakeup1-on-data
was pretty straightforward.  The following people could probably shed more
light on this than I could:
	stevea@shastanets.com - Steve Alexander
	fisher@sgi.com - Bill Fisher
	nn@epigram.com - Neal Nuckolls
I think they all worked on this.  Start with Steve.
