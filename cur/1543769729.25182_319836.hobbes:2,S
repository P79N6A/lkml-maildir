Looks much better :)
I still see a problem: what if old_nd.mnt is already detached, and
bind is non-recursive.  Now it fails with EINVAL, though it used to
work (and I think is very useful).
When doing up_write(...) you don't have to keep the order, just check
if the namespaces are not equal for the second up_write().
And why don't you do this:
	if (old_ns < mntpt_ns)
		down_write(&old_ns->sem);
instead of this
	if (old_ns < mntpt_ns) {
		down_write(&old_ns->sem);
	}
