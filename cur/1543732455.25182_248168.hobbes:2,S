Huh? Me about a year ago ;-)
Been in fact pretty much boo'd for it :-)
I therefore declare as this years hot issue:
How to use more than 32 GIDs on nfs? Frank van Maarseveens' patch being
available for years I guess, but with 2.6 supporting lots of GIDs becoming very
actual...
:-)))
Sorry for being a bit off-topic but shouldn't we first solve the obvious
(broken) and simple issues around fs?

Stephan
