Hello.
    I run 2.4.20 kernel on four boxes(VIA, ServerWorks etc). when I insert one cd into driver and
try to mount it. system no responses. then remove some options in kernel configs
and reinstall kernel. it could not find root to mount. when i remove ds.c from kernel. it can boot
to login.
    something wrong in ide driver or ds.c or cdrom driver ?
    Who can tell me ?
    thanks.
canny
