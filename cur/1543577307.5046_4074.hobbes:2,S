Hallo,
I'm using 2.4.0prerelease-ac4. As far as I can see most things work fine 
besides the following:
1. after make modules_install I get:
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in 
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test12/kernel/drivers/block/fusion/mptlan.o
depmod:         unregister_fcdev
depmod:         init_fcdev
2. With 2.4.0-ac3 I had system-freese 3 times. 
kind regards
Norbert
