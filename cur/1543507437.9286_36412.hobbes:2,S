There is a more specialized list:
linux-smp@vger.rutgers.edu
but this one is Ok too.

You must have very special C++ code... Be careful that gcc 2.95 is reported
to miscompile the kernel.

You will probably get a BX motherboard with a 100 MHz bus. So you need
PC100 SDRAM memory. If you currently are using EDO or FPM chips those won't
do.

You will have to recompile the kernel with SMP enabled or install
the SMP kernel rpm (something like kernel-smp-2.2.5-15.i686.rpm)

Only if we have one previously compiled for SMP (see above).

Newer kernels usually mean fewer bugs and/or more features. If yours work
fine
and there are no new drivers/bug fixes that interest you in a more recent
kernel
there is no particular harm in sticking with the one you have.

Only Pentium Xeon supports 4 way SMP boards and even then this are hard to
find.
Intel only sells them as part of complete systems.
