i think you have a misconception - the concept of decreasing latencies in
a mandatory way is nothing new to Linux, we've been doing it for quite
some time. (mem.c, lp.c, etc.) We just have to export it to all affected
places - now that bigger memory boxes became widespread. We already (of
course!) do 'reschedules during lengthy kernel operations', when the need
arises, we just dont do it explicitly when _another_ process wants us to
reschedule. The patch i've sent fills this hole - more coming.

my guesstimate is that we will not see any numbers getting worse. 
Actually, some RL numbers will get much better. (eg. i can already log in
much faster during heavy kernel compiles) The thing you missed i think is
that we do not have to do a reschedule, we just have to check the (local) 
->need_resched flag at a couple of well-chosen places. (see the patch)

you are arguing the wrong point ... Latency _is_ top priority in Linux. 
And it's not hard to get it, it's hard to _measure_ it reliably. (and this
is why your tool is so cool.)

i can get excellent latencies on my box, without giving up speed - good
enough?
