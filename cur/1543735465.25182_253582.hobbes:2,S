To me, this looks like the killer feature. You could even
skip the regular process info. Simply return process identification
cookies that could be passed into a separate syscall to get
the information.

I suppose this is small potatoes compared to the overhead
of dealing with ASCII, but individual field handling would
be a bit slower.
For initial libproc support, I'd start by requesting info
in groups that match what /proc provides today.

The stat() call simply fills in a struct. Given a per-process
cookie (or a PID if you tolerate the race conditions), a syscall
similar to stat() could fill in a struct.
