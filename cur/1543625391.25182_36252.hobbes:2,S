It is O(N), that's the worst case. Of course assuming that the number of
entries in the pool is N and that it is variable, for us it is variable
at compile time.

and if we didn't find anything we call flush_all_zero_pkmaps that does a
whole O(N) scan on the pool to try to release the entries that aren't
pinned and then we try again. In short if we increase the pool size, we
linearly increase the time we spend on it (actually more than linearly
because we'll run out of l1/l2/l3 while the pool size increases)

I will do that in the next -aa. I've quite a lot of stuff pending
(including Andrew split of my VM fixes to merge).

Good.

then just for curiousity you can try to write a program doing:
	open a file
	while 1:
		read 1 byte of it
		lseek back to the start of the file
and run 16 copies simultanously and the kmap_lock_cacheline should raise
again similar to previous levels (no matter if it's the same file or
not). You'll also hit the pagecache_lock in such a workload of course
(like you're also hitting the lru_lock during the kernel compiles for
the lru_cache_add of the anonymous ram).
The only brainer problem with the total removal of the persistent kmaps
are the copy-users, what's your idea about it? (and of course I'm not
going to change that anyways in 2.4, it's not a showstopper)
