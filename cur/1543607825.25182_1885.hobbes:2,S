This is one of the reasons I haven't been using the -ac kernels:  I
would have to reformat my quota files.  And then if I had to back
out, I would have to reformat them again...
I had a quick look at the code in -ac and it should be possible to
detect with a fair degree of certainty whether the file is in the old
format or the new format, and to select between approriate read/write
methods accordingly.   I suspect that would make the new quota stuff
an acceptable change for a "stable" kernel (chuckle chuckle).

P.S. No, I'm not volunteering.
