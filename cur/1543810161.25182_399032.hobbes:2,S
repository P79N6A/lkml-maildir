as does Linux-VServer currently, but do you have
any proof that putting all the fields together in
one big structure actually has any (dis)advantage
over separate structures?

do you really have to pass them at clone() time?
would shortly after be more than enough?
what if you want to change those properties later?

this is missing isolation/virtualization, and I guess
it has to be done to make those spaces useful ...

well, let's defer the 'how amny syscalls' issue to
a later time, when we know what we want to implement :)

well, depends how you do it ...
