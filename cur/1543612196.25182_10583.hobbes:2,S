Here is a fix. It is diffed against your original 0.08 version, Doug.
It makes GETOPTR set the LVI to the hardware fragment preceding the one 
that's currently playing. In the case of Quake, that means Quake must 
call GETOPTR at least every 3/4ths of a DMA buffer. Hopefully that 
requirement should be relaxed enough. The alternate fix is to modify the 
completion handlers.
I don't see anything obvious in the databook about how to make the 
hardware loop infinitely without taking any additional input from us.
Comments, please.
