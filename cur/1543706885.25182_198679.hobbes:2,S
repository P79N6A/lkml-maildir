We want a class device so the drivers can expose some informations like
the monitor probing data (EDID), allowed modes list etc... to userland.
I now have access to these infos in some drivers like radeonfb that do
full monitor probing, and the fbdev "API" provides no way to get that
down to userland (for use by xserver or MOL for example). I could just
add some cases to the existing ioctl API, but I don't like that ;)
