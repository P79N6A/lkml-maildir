Roman, 
While I respect your position that anything not GPL is evil, without
agreeing with it, that does not in any way extend to anything which
violates our license.
If there is some information that you need as a kernel developer which
BK is hiding from you of course we would provide that information.
To the best of my knowledge there is absolutely nothing that we are
hiding from you in that context.  If there is, let us know.  Our belief
is at least in part based on the lack of queries from anyone else.
On the other hand, if there is information that is not interesting to
a kernel developer but is interesting to someone trying to rip off our
software, no, we must respectfully decline to offer that.
Thanks,
--lm
