Disabling preemption seems to cause some discomfort in the RT community.
Steven already noticed that they could leverage migration disabling to
enhance the way they deal with softirqs. Basically, anything that must
be tied to a CPU for a short time, can deal with concurrency from other
threads running on the same CPU, but where we do not want to add to the
scheduler latency would be a good prospect for the migration_disable().

I agree. I added it knowing that we could either pack this in the
preempt_count (using masks, if there is still room, which does not seem
to be the case) or, if not, people who could make extensive use of this
could justify adding this field to the thread_info struct. I am barely
sending the idea out there so it can be helpful for the RT team.
