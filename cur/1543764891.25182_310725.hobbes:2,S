There is one "new" filesystem you should screw with:
$ echo foo > test
$ mkisofs test > /dev/fd0h1440
Total translation table size: 0
Total rockridge attributes bytes: 0
Total directory bytes: 0
Path table size(bytes): 10
Max brk space used 21000
175 extents written (0 Mb)
$ fdformat -n /dev/fd0h1440
Double-sided, 80 tracks, 18 sec/track. Total capacity 1440 kB.
Formatting ...   0
(press ^C after writing most of the first track, hexdump will show
 blocks of 0xf6)
$ mount /dev/fd0h1440 /z -t iso9660
$ cat /z/test
foo

This would require a) the device being smart enough and b) the bus
being smart enough.

That's because in contrast to floppy media and CD/RW, the tracks on
HDD don't need reformating. Floppy drives suffer from aging sector
headers, and CD/RW will AFAIK suffer from a loss in writing quality.

They need to report success. This would require delaying the end of the
operation till the formating has finished. ATAPI is dumb enough to block
the bus during that time. Off cause you could implement SCSI disconnect
for IDE, but that would be too easy.
