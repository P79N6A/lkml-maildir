In former times, the Linux kernel tried to sync in the panic function. (If 
the panic did not happen in interrupt context) Unfortunately this had 
severe side effects in cases where the panic was triggered by file system 
block device code or any other part which is necessary for syncing. In most 
cases the call trace never made it onto disk anyway. So currently the 
kernel does not support saving a panic.
Apart from using a serial console, you might have a look at several 
kexec/kdump/lkcd tools where people are working on being able to dump the 
memory of a paniced kernel.
