I applied the patch, but I meant more that wait_for_reset seems 
questionable.  There is generally a PIO or MMIO write preceding 
wait_for_reset function call, and then the function delays.  If the PCI 
write is posted, for example, which at least my own Via EPIA does, then 
you cannot be guaranteed the timing of
	write[bwl]()
	udelay(5)
PCI writes must be flushed, by doing a read[bwl]().
So, obvious PCI posting bugs in the wait_for_reset may be the cause of 
some of the randomness that appears in the field.  (Note this applies to 
all PCI writes in the driver...)
So, I said "voodoo magic" because it doesn't really seem like we know 
what the exact handling is... and randomly placed udelay() calls are, 
unfortunately, sometimes a sign of driver bugs instead of necessary 
hardware delays.

I would prefer both user and developer docs go in 
Documentation/networking/via-rhine.txt.  It is easy enough to note 
separate sections of the document...

Let me wave some dead chickens of my own, and see what happens...
