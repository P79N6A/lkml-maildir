Indeed never going back in time was an important part of the goal, but
it also is supposed to give the number of nanoseconds that have past
since boot. If the TSC is unsynched or changes frequency then we cannot
provide that. Additionally if the TSC is unsynched, monotonic_clock can
go backwards when using the TSC. 
If someone wants a highres and possibly inconsistent timestamp (somewhat
like sched_clock uses), get_cycles() provides that interface.
