With 
CONFIG_KEXEC=y
CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP=y
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x1000000
and the above __pa(vaddr) >> PAGE_SHIFT changed things worked for me but
I am still confused as to why the pte we set is c1686f6c and we flush
and return c13db000. 
get_memcfg_from_srat: assigning address to rsdp fdfc0
RSD PTR  v0 [IBM   ]
rsdp->rsdt_address eff9c2c0
boot_ioremap phys_addr = eff9c2c0 long = 44
__boot_ioremap phys_addr = eff9c000 pages = 1 source c13db000
setting pte  c1686f6c to eff9c063
just flushed c13db000
boot_ioremap and I return c13db2c0
rsdt = c13db2c0 header is RSDT4
Begin SRAT table scan....
thanks,
  Keith
