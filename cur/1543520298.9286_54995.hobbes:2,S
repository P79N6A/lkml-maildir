Wow, they are broken.  Under 2.3.34 I get:
    sailboat> mkfifo /tmp/f
    sailboat> cat /tmp/f &
    [1] 943
    sailboat> echo hello >/tmp/f
    sailboat> echo hello > /tmp/f
    sailboat> (echo hello;sleep 1) > /tmp/f
    hello
    hello
    hello
    [1]    Done                          cat /tmp/f
Under 2.0.35 everything seems to work fine.  I do not have a 2.2.X kernel
to test.
