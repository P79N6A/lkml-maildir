I've sent acks for a couple, but not all.
No ack for the sys_sync removal because I think this is just a work around for 
fuse issues, and fuse should be fixed (getting fuse tasks frozen 
post-sys_sync makes far more sense to me).
No ack for the other patches because I haven't put the time into considering 
them.
