I am releasing now a new patch. It will have the fixes for the bug
triggered in 2.2.6_andrea3 and will have the fixes for the
performances-bugs I found previously in 2.2.6_andrea2. It will return to
use the hashtable for the buffer cache (I discovered that rb-trees was
harming a lot buffer-query performances). And now I spliced the whole
rb-tree for all the page cache in a per-inode rb-tree (that Chuck just
benchmarked and was working well ;).
So I expect this new patch to be faster than the previous two ones, a lot
faster than 2.2.6_andrea2 while shirnking the cache, and more stable than
the buggy 2.2.6_andrea3 ;).
If you'll try it let me know! ;) Thanks.
Andrea Arcangeli
PS. (If I am not asking too much I would ask people who did benchmarks for
     2.2.6_andrea2.bz2 to redo them on this new 2.2.6_andrea4.bz2 and
     feedback so I'll know if what I did in the last days is right or
     not). (thanks)
