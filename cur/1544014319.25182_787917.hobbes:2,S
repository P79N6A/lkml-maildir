If it would be possible, for example, for the 'init' namespace to have
no network interfaces at all, then it would be nicer to use a name
that's at least been used with nfs at *some* point--just on the general
principle of not leaking information to a domain that the user wouldn't
expect it to.
(Assuming it's unlikely anyone would consider init's utsname to be
sensitive information, that's a minor point.)
