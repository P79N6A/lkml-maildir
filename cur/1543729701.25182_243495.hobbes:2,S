That's beause so little of the kbuild infrastructure is enabled
when including arch/um/Makefile
You need to move the *.lds.S files to for example arch/um/kernel then
you can use the kbuild infrastructure.
The fact that the .S.o rule is enabled is due to the kallsyms hack.

For klibc I'm halfway with kbuild infrastructure to build user programs.
Syntax is very similar to what is know today, and I hope we can use it
for um as well.
See: linux-sam.bkbits.net select klibc
Browse source and look into usr/kinit/Makefile for an example
But to use this for um we would need to separte all user mode programs
out in separate directories . as discused before.
