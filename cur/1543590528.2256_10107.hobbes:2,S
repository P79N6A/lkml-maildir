Whoops!  The create test is exactly the case my index patch 
accelerates, trying it is highly recommended:
  
http://nl.linux.org/~phillips/htree/dx.testme-2.4.3-3
To apply:
    cd source/tree
    zcat ext2-dir-patch-S4.gz | patch -p1
    cat dx.pcache-2.4.4 | patch -p0
Or for the all-in-page-cache version (needs Al Viro's patch, see the 
READ.ME at 
http://nl.linux.org/~phillips/htree/
):
  
http://nl.linux.org/~phillips/htree/dx.pcache-2.4.4-4
The testme version is easier to apply but the pcache version is more 
like what the final form will be (waiting for Al's patch to get into 
Linus's tree so I can de-fork this).
