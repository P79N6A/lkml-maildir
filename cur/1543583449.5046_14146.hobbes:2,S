What's good about that?  The first thing I do is to rip out the RedHat
kernel and compile and install a pure kernel from ftp.kernel.org. 
It's *bad* that those vendors deliver hacked kernels.  It's not
something that should be recommended as a *goal*!
When I need a new kernel version I can't sit back and hope with 
crossed fingers that RedHat (or whatever vendor) comes out with a 
new, hacked version of Linus' latest.
