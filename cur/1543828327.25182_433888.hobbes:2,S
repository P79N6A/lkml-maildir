But I don't think it ever worked, as you stated.

You forgot:

No one is forcing you to use udev :)

No, just do what the distros that use udev do today, load the needed
modules at boot time, based on the hardware that is present in the
system.  This should work just fine for the uinput driver, and if not,
simply add it to the list of modules that need to be loaded every boot
(each distro has a different place to put this list), and you should be
fine.
Please realize that the method of loading a module based on the device
node number is very restrictive, and only works for a small minority of
drivers.  This is due to the wide range of hardware sharing device nodes
(do you want to load all of the possible sound drivers when you touch
the sound device node?, no, you just want it "to work automatically",
which is what happens today at boot time with udev.)

Yes, look at how the distros do this today for loop, they merely load it
at boot time and everyone's happy.
And this whole thing has nothing to do with devfs, as you stated above
:)
