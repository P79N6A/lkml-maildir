But a user-space program might not get a timeslice before some fork() or
malloc() bomb runs the system out of virtual memory, at which point only
the kernel is guaranteed to properly function. I don't think you can solve
this problem without the kernel killing tasks.
The daemon should assign priorities to tasks as they are started, thus
keeping policy in user-space. Then when OOM situations occur, the kernel
already knows which tasks go to the firing squad.
