ok, I *suspect* '0x1b' is the flags state for the bh->b_state when the
machine hangs

I had a minimal list of processes running.  I wasn't able to trigger it via
pine so I did it with apache and wget.
In the dmesg above, the normal print is one every few seconds  29 in 18
seconds is more than the usual.
If someone wants to give me a crash course on struct bh to give an much more
descriptive output like what numbers belong to what processes, ....well, i'd
sure love that and this would surely help the debugging :)
11001 is the bitmap, MSB first.
BH_Uptodate  = 1	;1 if the buffer contains valid data
BH_Dirty     = 0	;1 if the buffer is dirty
BH_Lock      = 0	;1 if the buffer is locked 
BH_Req       = 1	;0 if the buffer has been invalidated
BH_Mapped	 = 1	;1 if the buffer has a disk mapping
BH_New       = 0	;1 if the buffer is new and not yet written out
BH_Protected = 0	;1 if the buffer is protected
