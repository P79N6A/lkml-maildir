-Wsign-compare is TOTALLY useless.
The problem with signed compares is not just comparing a signed entity
against a unsigned one. It's quite common to have signed quantities on
both sides, but _intending_ a unsigned comparison or vice versa.
This is simply an area where it's better to make people think about the
types, than to magically try to do the "right" thing.

[ Standard stupid min() removed ]
You just fixed the "re-use arguments" bug - which is a bug, but doesn't
address the fact that most of the min/max bugs are due to the programmer
_indending_ a unsigned compare because he didn't even think about the
type.
