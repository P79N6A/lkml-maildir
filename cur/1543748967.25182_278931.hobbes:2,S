Andi, there is at least one other hypervisor interface, mac-on-linux
features a kernel module that allows booting other kernels inside the
running one, and keeps very good speed anyways.
Their code, at least the user-space part, was also very good coded
for my eyes.
Driver support is done by exporting a customized open-firmware
device tree and then implementing drivers for these devices on
the client OSs.
(just goto 
http://www.maconlinux.org/
 and have a look)
Oh, this is obviusly ppc-only ATM :)
