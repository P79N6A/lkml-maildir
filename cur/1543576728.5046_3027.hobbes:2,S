Yes:
        shmget           == shm_open (+ ftruncate(fd, size))
        shmat            == mmap (0, size, , , fd, 0)
        shmdt            == munmap (addr, size);
        shmctl(IPC_RMID) == shm_unlink ()
        shmctl(IPC_STAT) == fstat();
        shmctl(IPC_LOCK) == mlock() /*nearly*/
        shmctl(IPC_SET)  == fchown(), fchmod()
You can get the Linux special behaviour to be able to attach to a
removed segment by its shmid by passing the file descriptor for the
posix shm from the attached process to the attaching process.
Did I miss something?
