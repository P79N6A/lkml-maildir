   i think the networking code is a special case - nothing else relies on the
   interaction of timers and IRQ contexts in such a deep way. (which it does
   for performance reasons.) I'd say 99% of all cli()/sti() users are in the
   'introduce a per-driver or per-subsystem lock' league Linus mentioned.
I'm sure the serial drivers used to.  Look at how they were using
SERIAL_BH for example.
RMK's stuff fixes that so wrt. the current state of affairs you're
probably right.
