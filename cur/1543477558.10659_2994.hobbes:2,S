Very nice! 
* I can't seem to force the kernel the swap out any process by just doing
  filesystem level ops ala
      find / -xdev -exec cat {} > /dev/null \;
  or any other stuff like that. It certainly no longer swaps out your
  shell on a ls -lR.  
* The responsiveness lost a few versions ago is back. I don't know how to
  measure it, but its clearly noticable.
* Dunno when it happened, but I can put all my HD's into DMA mode with
hdparm -c1 -d1 -m8 -u1 /dev/hda
hdparm -c1 -d1 -m8 -u1 /dev/hdb
hdparm -c1 -d1 -m8 -u1 /dev/hdc
  and they work. Previously, only /dev/hda could use -d1 safely. I also
notice that the numbers from hdparm -tT and bonnie are approximately the
same for the first time in my knowledge.
/dev/hda4: (this is my root partition, so it probably had various activity
while bonnie was running)
