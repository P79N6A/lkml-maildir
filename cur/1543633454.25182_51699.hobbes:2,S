True.
However, that only works for function declarations.
typedefs are easy to avoid.
The real #include hell comes, to a large degree, from the fact that we
like inline functions. Which have many wonderful properties, but they have
the same nasty property typedefs have: they require full type information
and cannot be predeclared.
And while I'd like to avoid #include hell, I'm not willing to replace
inline functions with #define's to avoid it ;^p
