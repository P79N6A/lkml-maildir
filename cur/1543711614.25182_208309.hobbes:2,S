It would really be wrong to have nopage() return a pte. The thing is, the 
VM really works on "struct page", all over the map. It does things like 
"page_cache_release()" on the page if the file-backed VMA has been 
truncated, and it just knows that the return value from "nopage()" has 
_structure_. 
Some architectures have per-page flags for things like "this page may need 
to have icache flushed from it" etc.
So I really put my veto on "nopage()" returning a PFN. That's just wrong, 
wrong, wrong. It returns a "struct page" pointer, and it has lots of 
reasons for that.
And none of the reasons for _not_ doing it are valid, since such a user 
can just pre-populate the page tables anyway.
So don't go there.
