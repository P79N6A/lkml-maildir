Fair enough.  One use of "delay" is in a comment you wrote; I'll change it 
as well.

Personally I don't understand what was wrong with my name.  What's weird 
or unintuitive about doing something in a different task's context?
Dmitry's suggestion is slightly inappropriate because the function doesn't
take a workstruct as an argument and it isn't itself a workqueue callback.  
Would people be happier with sysfs_schedule_callback() and
device_schedule_callback()?  At least the functions do take a callback 
pointer as an argument, even though they aren't callbacks themselves.
