I am writing a driver for a TAOS evaluation module. This device is a
limited SMBus master, connecting to the serial port. The evaluation
chip is connected to the SMBus. In my case this is a TSL2550 light
sensor, but virtually all compatible TAOS evaluation modules could be
supported.
I2C bus drivers have to be implemented in the kernel, so user-space
isn't an option for me.
I just posted a first (working) version of my driver, if you want to
take a look:
