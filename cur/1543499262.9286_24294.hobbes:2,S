Subject: uninitialized PCI VGA cards and matroxfb

I'm trying to setup my my dual head (TNT2 and Matrox Millennium II) using
Linux's Framebuffer subsystem. I specifically want X on the primary video
card (TNT2/vesafb) and a plain text console on the matroxfb.
While trying to enable this setup, I found that my BIOS doesn't initialize
the secondary video card. This caused the matroxfb to crash when it tried
to access the Millennium II's framebuffer/registers.
After playing with the kernel, I could enable the memory for the secondary
video card with this piece of code from arch/i386/kernel/bios32.c ("dev"
is the secondary VGA card in question):
unsigned short cmd;
pci_read_config_word(dev, PCI_COMMAND, &cmd);
if (!(cmd & PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY)) {
	printk("PCI: Enabling memory for device %02x:%02x\n",
		dev->bus->number, dev->devfn);
	cmd |= PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY;
	pci_write_config_word(dev, PCI_COMMAND, cmd);
}
And this function would enable the secondary video card's bus mastering
capability:
pci_set_master(dev);
But the Matrox Millennium II is still not configured correctly.
It's IRQ is 0, and it's three base_address registers appear to be
suspiciously incorrect:
Memory at ff000000 (32-bit, prefetchable)
Memory at ffffc000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
Memory at ff800000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
The size of the memory regions are respectively:
0 is 16 megabytes
1 is 16 kilobytes
2 is 8  megabytes
Hmmm...
base_address[0] == -16MB
base_address[1] == -16KB
base_address[2] == -8MB
The size of each of these memory locations and where they are located in
memory cause ioremap to fail:
        /*
         * Don't allow mappings that wrap..
         */
        if (!size || size > phys_addr + size)
                return NULL;
I'm currently trying to figure out what to do next. Working inside the
kernel is rather new to me, and I don't know way around the PCI subsystem
either. So if I made a mistake, or you think I'm doing something wrong,
please enlighten me.
In short, any assistance would be greatly appreciated! :-)
I've appended the output of lspci -vvvxxx WRT the Millennium II for the
curious (the output is from an unmodificed 2.2.9 kernel).
