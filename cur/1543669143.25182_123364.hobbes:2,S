I think at this only for the linear stuff. it would solve Andrew's
exploit against objrmap, for each page we would walk only the vmas
matching the pagetables mapping to the page. However those sub-objects
have a cost, the cost will be 8bytes per fragment. the slowest part
should be the split of the subobject when a new mapping happens and the
possible flood of list_add/list_del. I'm unsure it worth.
However it would be nice to se how the current 2.4 pte walking clock
algorithm does compared to objrmap and rmap when ext2 is used because
ext3 generated an I/O bound behaviour at least for my tree, that made
any vm-side comparison invalid.
