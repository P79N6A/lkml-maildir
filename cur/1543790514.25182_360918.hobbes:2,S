Although many people use it for that, so it must be useable.

You don't cite an example of where this fails. The only practical
limitation I've seen in lxr is that it doesn't index certain symbols
which arrive through complex defines (and this is a place where asking
the compiler for help *is* useful).

That is a good idea.

coherency is the wrong term here. The database in both should be as
they're derived from a static kernel tree (if not, then there are
other problems). But I'll agree that your idea (I haven't yet checked
the implementation - it was very short) in theory is a good one. LXR
still works great though :-)
