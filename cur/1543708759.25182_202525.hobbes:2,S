Dear mailing list members!
I'd like to know, how do you solve this problem on your own systems. 
I've installed a linux distribution with a 2.2.18 kernel, than i've 
downloaded, compiled and installed a 2.6.2 kernel. How can i make, if i 
want to compile any application ( like Samba, Apache, KDE, etc...), the 
gcc compiler use the '/usr/src/linux-2.6.2/include' header path instaead 
of the '/usr/include' for such include directories like 'linux', 'asm', 
'asm-generic', etc...?
Yours
Tibor Kendl
