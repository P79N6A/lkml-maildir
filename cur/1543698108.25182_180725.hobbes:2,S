It's a GUI for selecting what to include for compiling a kernel that 
integrates in the KDE control center. Like make configmenu (IIRC)

I did "make oldconfig", and then I selected my personal hardware.
Nope, it was the gcc that caused the trouble. I found gcc-2.95 on my 
machine, too, and changed the link of /usr/bin/gcc to this version. 
Then the kernel compiled! It was just to large - now I put most drivers 
to modules - mh, and get some other errors, but let this be another 
thread :)
Just have to find out how to pipe stdout and stderr simultanously into 
ONE log file. something like "make bzImage 1&2>logfile"
Thanx for replying
