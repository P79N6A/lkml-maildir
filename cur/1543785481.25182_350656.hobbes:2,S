This one is related to libata.  Known problem:
     
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3880
Silicon Image 311x throws interrupts after we told the hardware to 
disable interrupts, but only for a few certain devices and/or PATA 
bridges.  I only have theories as to the solution.
I made a failed attempt to solve it here:
     
http://search.luky.org/linux-kernel.2005/msg14830.html
This patch from Albert Lee might solve it, but the patch itself needs 
bug fixes:
     http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=112628285200005&r=1&w=2
Also, defining ATA_IRQ_TRAP in include/linux/libata.h may work around 
the problem.
Plenty more info available on request.  Nothing changed in this area 
with regards to 2.6.12/2.6.13, so I presume that ACPI has simply exposed 
the existing problem for you.  :(
