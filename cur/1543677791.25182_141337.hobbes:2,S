But there is no inheritance here.  Block device and IDE disk are
different objects and relation is not "A is B with <...>", it's
"among other things, A happens to use B in a way <...>".  
Moreover, there is no such thing as "physical device of that block device".
There might be many.  There might be none.  IOW, we have a bunch of
constructors for class "block device" and some of them happen to have
some kinds of physical devices among their arguments.  That's it.
