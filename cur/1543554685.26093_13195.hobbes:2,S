	I think something is wrong if the ip_conntrack module does not
flush it's table after the connections and all that stop. I understand why
it does this during the attack...but it doesn't make sense why these tables
are kept long after.  A userspace tool is not something i think is needed,
this piece of code should be in the module, it is either not correctly
coded or missing entirely.

Everyone has seen that :)   ... that's not exactly what i was talking about
the main error message i was worried about was the "ip_conntrack: maximum
limit of 2048 entries exceeded" when there was absolutely not traffic
coming in and the attack was long since over.  I think this is a fairly
major bug with the module since it made the firewall inoperable until i
reloaded the module..  this DDoS could be repeated on any linux box that is
not babysat 24/7 it seems.  My firewall drops everything so all the
attacker needs to do is get a bunch of sources to send packets (specific?
not sure) rapidly enough to fill the ip_conntrack table and your site
becomes offline.   any other ideas?
