Me either.  I learn enough for the problem at hand, then instaforget it
again.  Kinda like perl.

hm, OK, there's the problem.  This is an offered-to-the-user config option.
If you do
-	int "Kernel stack size order"
+	int
then this rule will no longer be offered to the user and `make oldconfig'
(actually anythingconfig) will override whatever happens to be in .config
for KERNEL_STACK_ORDER.
I'm not sure if that's actually what you want, but if the current situation
is that a random CONFIG_KERNEL_STACK_ORDER=0 left over in .config will
break the kernel at runtime then I think something sterner than editing
defconfig is needed?
