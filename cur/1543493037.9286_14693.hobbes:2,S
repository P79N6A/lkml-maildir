Ah, I thought so. Yes, I did initially. I then changed my mind. The
kernel drops caps on exec.

Actually, I suspect that I could get it to work even in user
space. You're right, you'd need a special system call. But it's
getting a bit ugly, and the amount of code needed to support a user
space scheme would be about the same as the amount of code required to
just do it in the kernel. And the kernel space implementation would be
100% robust.

My (new) scheme provides both.
