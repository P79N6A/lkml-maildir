The point was the application was started in a manner which would not 
make best use of this policy. The way it was started put everything 
under the same policy, and had equal performance with doing the same 
thing as SCHED_FIFO. So if it's a showstopper for SCHED_ISO then it is a 
showstopper for SCHED_FIFO. Which is, of course, not the case. The test 
needs to be performed again with the rt threads running SCHED_ISO, which 
  Jack has pointed out is trivial. Nice -n -20 on the other hand will 
suffer from this problem even if only the real time thread was run at -20.
