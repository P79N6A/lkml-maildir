I got the idea from the x86-64 code; prompted by you, I looked at it, 
and it appears correct, but I would like to give it a full audit as well 
(especially regarding 32-bit compatibility segments).
About the three cases here:
The prefetch workaround should be harmless, again because of limit 
checking, the kernel is safe even in the raceful cases.
One can imagine clever uses for ptrace to do, say user space 
virtualization (since I'm on the topic), or other neat things.  So there 
is nothing really wrong about having the fully correct EIP conversion 
(and here we shouldn't need to worry about races causing some issues 
with strict correctness, since there can be one external control thread).
But were kprobes even inteneded for userspace?  There are races here 
that are difficult to close without some heavy machinery, and I would 
rather not put the machinery in place if simplifying the code is the 
right answer.
