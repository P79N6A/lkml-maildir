    The patch below reserves an ioctl for getting the size in blocks of a
    device as a long long instead of long as the old ioctl did.  The patch for
    this to e2fsprogs sneaked in a bit too early.  There is a conflict with
    the ia64 get/set sector ioctls, but I that's less common than e2fsprogs.
    +#define BLKGETSIZE64 _IO(0x12,109)    /* return device size (long long *arg) */
There are more conflicts with the numbering.
But more interestingly, I don't think we need the size in blocks.
We need the size in bytes.
(In 32-bit space we need the 8 or 9 or 10 bits extra provided by
counting blocks instead of bytes, but it causes quite a few problems.
In 64-bit space we can avoid all problems and work in bytes.
(Or even in bits.))
