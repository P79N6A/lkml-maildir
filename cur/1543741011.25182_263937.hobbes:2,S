Hello,
  what is purpose of this change in 2.6.10-rc1?  I seem to have no
problems after removing dependency on FW_LOADER, and my hardware 
definitely does not need any firmware to work.
  I also do not understand why bttv depends on I2C and selects
I2C_ALGOBIT.  Should not it depend on I2C_ALGOBIT instead, or
select both I2C and I2C_ALGOBIT.  Doing it this way seems rather
strange to me.
				Thanks,
					Petr Vandrovec
