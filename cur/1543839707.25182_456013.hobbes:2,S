Shouldn't this at leat use a hrtimer?

You still include those sill filename ontop of file comments..

When looking at the kevent_storage_init callers most need to do
those lockdep_set_class class.  Shouldn't kevent_storage_init just
get a "struct lock_class_key *" argument?

This is returned to userspace, isn't it?  raw jiffies should never be
user-visible.  Please convert this to an unit that actually makes sense
for userspace (probably nanoseconds)

I think this should be static, and the normal style to write it would be:
static struct kevent_callbacks tc = {
	.callback	= kevent_timer_callback,
	.enqueue	= kevent_timer_enqueue,
	.dequeue	= kevent_timer_dequeue,
};
also please consider makring all the kevent_callbacks structs const
to avoid false cacheline sharing and accidental modification, similar
to what we did to various other operation vectors.
