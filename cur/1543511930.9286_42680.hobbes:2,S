Hi,
  I am developing an application which needs certain support from kernel
(via system call) to speed up data transfer from one socket to one or more
sockets. I don't want to use the system calls like read,write as this
involves too many buffer copies and also context switches (from user to
kernel). Instead, I want the kernel to read the data from sk_buff que of
the source sockets and push directly into those for the destination
sockets.
I have been trying to understand various things on this regard for last
few weeks by going through the Linux kernel source code (version 2.2.9).
Could you please clarify a few doubts in this regards ..
 A> At which point in the TCP implementaion, do you have ordered,
non-duplicated data stream (as if ready to be consumed by the
application).
 B> Is it possible to retrive this data stream and form into sk_buff and
subsequently call tcp_write for the outgoing sockets ? I mean will it
actually take care of ACK's and sliding-window management ?
 C> Can anybody suggest any other or possibly best way to achieve this ?
Thanks,
Koushik
