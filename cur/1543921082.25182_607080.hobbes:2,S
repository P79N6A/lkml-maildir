Learn to read.  Linux has never allowed that.  Most of the Unix systems
do not allow that.  Original _did_ allow that, but at the cost of very
easily triggered fs corruption (and it didn't have things like rename(2) -
it _did_ have userland implementation, of course, in suid-root mv(1),
but that sucker had been extremely racy and could be easily used to
screw filesystem to hell and back; adding rename(2) to the set of primitives
combined with multiple links to directories leads to very nasty issues on
_any_ system).
