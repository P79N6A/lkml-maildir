Hi Con,
I'm running ck4 and I'm getting pauses during init (alsa, hdparm, 
hotplug).  By repeatedly pressing Alt-SysRq-p, I can get things going 
again within 15 seconds, otherwise I suspect it would take that 3 1/2 
hours to finish init like it did with ck3.  I think I had the same thing 
just happen in X.  The mouse got jerky and then stopped responding, even 
numlock wouldn't respond for about 15-30 seconds.  I'm logging a vmstat 
now to see if I can reproduce it.
It seems that disabling kernel preemption solved the problem during 
init, but the system feels slower (jerky mouse under X during compile).
Would anything that you've updated since ck4 take care of this?  If not, 
is there anything you can suggest I do to troubleshoot this issue?
Thanks,
Wes
