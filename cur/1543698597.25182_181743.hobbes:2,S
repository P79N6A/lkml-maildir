Correct.  But this requirement can easily be weakened a enough for
encryption to work.  A couple ALIGN(..., encrypt_blocksize) at two or
three places should do the trick.

True, although that barely makes a difference.  In either case you
have to seperate known-plaintext data from the rest and either not
encrypt it or use a different key.  The hard part is seperating the
data.

If it is done, yes.  "fsck it, who cares" may also be a valid design.

Because it is fun doing so or someone pays for it.  And - more to the
point - the humans should be the weakest link, that is bad enough
already.  No reason to make/leave things worse.
