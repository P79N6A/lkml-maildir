Subject: [PATCH 2/2] locks: add warning about mandatory locking races
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/25/284

The mandatory file locking implementation has long-standing races that
probably render it useless.  I know of no plans to fix them.  Till we
do, we should at least warn people.

+0. Why should I avoid mandatory locking?
+----------------------------------------
+
+The Linux implementation is prey to a number of difficult-to-fix race
+conditions which in practice make it not dependable:
+
+	- The write system call checks for a mandatory lock only once
+	  at its start.  It is therefore possible for a lock request to
+	  be granted after this check but before the data is modified.
+	  A process may then see file data change even while a mandatory
+	  lock was held.
+	- Similarly, an exclusive lock may be granted on a file after
+	  the kernel has decided to proceed with a read, but before the
+	  read has actually completed, and the reading process may see
+	  the file data in a state which should not have been visible
+	  to it.
+	- Similar races make the claimed mutual exclusion between lock
+	  and mmap similarly unreliable.
