If you want to know exactly what occurs, look at the code.
If you want an overview, a summary, a quick scan of the logic contained
within the code, and perhaps suggested best usage of the code, look at
the docs (if they exist).
The system I propose is entirely optional, and code can be documented
gradually, as developer time and outside contributions permit.
