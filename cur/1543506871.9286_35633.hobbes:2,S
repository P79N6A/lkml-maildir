Subject: Sparc CFLAGS question relating to 2.2.x

     In arch/sparc/Makefile, CFLAGS has amoung other things -mno-fpu.
     It was my understanding that no floating point math was allowed in the
kernel anyway, so I fail to understand the need for that flag.
     On the other hand, there seems to be no detection for version 8 Sparc
and the inclusion of -mv8.  It would seem to make sense to use hardware to
do interger multiply/divides if it exists?
