Hi!
We've got a lot of machines with the eepro 100 from intel onboard, and when
we try to stress-test the network (running bonnie++ on a nfs-shared
directory on a machine), the network-card says "eth0: Card reports no
resources" to dmesg, and then the "line" appear dead for some time (one
minutte or more). What can be done to remove this error? NFS timesout with
this error (obviously)...
