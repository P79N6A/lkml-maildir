You could have only one routine that would need a relocation / patch at
dynamic linking stage :
absolute_syscall:
    jmp  0xfffff000
Then all syscalls routine could use :
getpid:
    ...
    call absolute_syscall
    ...
instead of "call 0xfffff000"
If the kernel doesnt support the 0xfffff000 page, you could patch
absolute_syscall (if it resides in .data section) with :
    absolute_syscall:
            int 0x80
            ret
(3 bytes instead of 5 bytes)
