Hi,
Did you remark than the disk model is reported correctly with "hdparm -i .." and
there is some garbage (letters mixed) when using "hdparm -I .."
with hdparm -i /dev/hdb :
Model=WDC WD172AA, FwRev=82.10A82, SerialNo=WD-WM6910086788
with hdparm -I /dev/hdb
Model=DW CDW71A2 A                            , FwRev=281.A028,
SerialNo=DWW-6M19006887 8
I've the same thing here, even if the disk seems to be correctly detected.
Only the DMA mode does not work here.
