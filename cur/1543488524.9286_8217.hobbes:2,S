I have had the same problems with these CPU's. My fix is to boot the
install disk, get to the initial installation menus, then swap floppies
with one containing the set6x86 package, I run that, then swap back and
continue with the install.  The key is running set6x86 as soon as possible
in the install process before the CPU gets too hot.
Adding a thin coating of heatsink compound between chip and heatsink helps
too. It is available at any electronics parts store and at such places as
Tandy/Radio Shack.
