The kernel executes functions upon behalf of the caller. The
caller's pointer is only valid when the caller calls the
kernel. At another time, the kernel has its data-segment
set to KERNEL_DS and other times set to the virtual address
space of other callers.
Anything written like you propose is likely to vomit and
take your corner of the galaxy with it. Please get a good
book about kernel device drivers first before you start.
