Is this still happening?  What was the bug?

Is this still with 384 megs of memory?

One possibile culprit here is the doubling of the request queue size
in 2.5.20.  A long time ago it was 1024 slots.  Then it went to
128.  That's where it is in Marcelo kernels.  Then -ac kernels
went up to 1024 because they have read-latency2.  Somehow 2.5 found
itself at 256 slots.  In 2.5.20 it slealthily snuck up to 512
slots.  I didn't squeak about this because I was interested to see what
effect it would have.
Does this patch get the throughput back?
