I'm looking for a hint on which will possibly go into mainline kernel,
if any.  Right now there's supposedly a few things built on Dazuko, like
Clamuko (ClamAV on-access scanning); but I've yet to really encounter
anything aside from that that use Dazuko so :)
I'm thinking of a lot of things that can be done with on-access control
from userspace.
RSBAC and LSM seem to do almost the same thing, except that RSBAC
actually comes with a lot of modules to use it (LSM/SELinux are separate
projects, but both integrated into the kernel, AFAIK).  I don't see
RSBAC going into mainline; I don't know which is better though, LSM or
RSBAC.  This brings to mind pointless and random proof-of-concept tasks,
such as porting SELinux to RSBAC; or porting LSM to RSBAC (as an rsbac
module), or RSBAC to LSM (as an lsm module).
