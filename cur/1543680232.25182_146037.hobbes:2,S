OK, the 100k diff between 2.4.21/fs/fat and 2.5.74 didn't really help me 
understand what's really changed (other than the cvf removal).
Should I attempt to brute-force backport fs/fat/* in one large patch, or 
incrementally re-apply the 2.5 changes to 2.4 ?
Or, as you write 'some parts', which parts would that be ?
