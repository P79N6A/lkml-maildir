Could you please include following patch to your tree? I need this because
we deploy machines with more then 16 interfaces. It's not a problem for me
to patch the kernel but a patch less to carry on each new kernel release is
something less to be able to forget. I know, it's not an actual bugfix but
it's also nothing to worry about since it definitely doesn't break anything
nor unnecessary bloats the kernel.
