It's debatable but I think things will be safer this way.  If we wait by
default, we are forced to check that all references are dropped and will
have a stack dump indicating which object is causing problem when
something goes wrong, which is better than silent object leaking and/or
jumping to non-existent address way later.
I personally think all driver interface should be made this way such
that completion of unregister function guarantees no further access to
the object or module.  IMHO, it's more intuitive and easier to force
correctness.
I'm not sure about kobject_put() but device_unregister() waiting for
release doesn't sound bad to me.
