Yeah, just as with MIPS, the bits which are affected by CONFIG variables
just shouldn't be outside the __KERNEL__ ifdef at all -- they shouldn't
be seen.

Er, asm-powerpc/page.h is empty after unifdef, which is entirely
correect. In fact asm/page.h is one of the files which should probably
be removed from user visibility entirely. There's nothing there which
userspace should see, in general.
