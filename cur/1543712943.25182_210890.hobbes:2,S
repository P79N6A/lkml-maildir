But that is impossible as has already been pointed out by Alan Stern.
If a module creates a kobject, how can the module_exit() function ever
be called if that kobject incremented the module reference count?
So what we do is any reference to the kobject grabbed by userspace
causes the module reference count to go up.  That fixes the issue for
the most part (with the exception of the race that Maneesh has
documented.)
