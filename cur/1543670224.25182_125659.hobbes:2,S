I can see a use for doing per-object debug levels, but I'd rather not add 
the overhead to every object, especially when it would be used by a small 
minority of the populace. 
Such a flag could easily be placed in the subsystem-specific object, and 
accessed through the logging/debugging wrappers.

Yes.

It would be nice. Unfortunately, it's only a nifty pipe-dream at the 
moment, unless some lucky volunteer would like to step forward. ;)
