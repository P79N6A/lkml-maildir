Your processes will show strange start times, CPU times etc.
This will happen in 2.5 pretty soon (after 50 days uptime).
However, this is a bit cosmetic. There is a much more serious problem:
		Jiffy Wrap Bugs
There were reports of machines hanging on jiffy wrap.
This is typically a result of incorrect jiffy use in some driver.
Ask Tim - he is hunting those problems regularly, but he is outnumbered
by buggy driver authors. :(
There is a better solution to ensure correct jiffy wrap handling in
*ALL* kernel code: make jiffy wrap in first five minutes of uptime.
Tim has a patch for such config option. This is almost right.
This MUST NOT be a config option, it MUST be mandatory in every
kernel. Driver writers would be bitten by their own bugs and will
fix it themself. Tim, what do you think?
