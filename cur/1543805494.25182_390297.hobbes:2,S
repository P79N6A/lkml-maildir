This means CPU hotplug will require additional non existing code again - or who
will set up the APIC IDs etc. for the new CPUs then?
An alternative might be to reject any entries that have the APIC ID of
an existing entry. That would require that the entries are sorted with disabled
after enabled
(in the worst case Linux could sort again)
