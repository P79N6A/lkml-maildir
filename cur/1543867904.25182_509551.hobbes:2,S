This is just your personal opinion.
"derivative work" is a term with many grey areas.
Does linking create a derivative work?
Or including the code of one "static inline" function in your binary?
There is no border everyone agrees on.
And even judges in different jurisdictions might decide differently
based on different copyright laws.
Perhaps some module would be considered legal in the USA and Russia but 
illegal in Germany and China, or the other way round.
