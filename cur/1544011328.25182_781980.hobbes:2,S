Should be fixed now by the following patch from Cornelia:
commit efe46b59567ae999ff7d344170d21f093159ad80
Author: Cornelia Huck <cornelia.huck@de.ibm.com>

    [S390] cio: Use device_is_registered().
    Check if a ccw device is registered via device_is_registered()
    and not via the old kludge of checking the membership in driver
    core internal klists.

You'll find the fix in the features branch of git390 which will be
included in the next linux-next kernel.
