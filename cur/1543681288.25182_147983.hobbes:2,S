The problem is solved taking off the CONFIG_DEVFS_MOUNT from config
Thanks Zwane, i think is the 3 time (at least)that you help me to solve
a problem with devel kernels.
The problems seems to be that gento tries to mount devfs, and it was
already mounted, I took off the CONFIG_DEVFS_DEBUG too, but I dont think
that has nothing to do with the problem, i just dont think i will use it
BTW, taking off DEVFS at all, i cannot mount SCSI disks, that seems to
be the only problem, I still have a problem with NFS daemon, but at leas
I have my NFS mounts working well, I think its a init script problem, i
will try to correct that.
