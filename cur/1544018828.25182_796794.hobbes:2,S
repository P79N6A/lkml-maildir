Compiled the latest kernel with  patch-2.6.29-rc1-git4
applied along with an mm patch
Included support for the DVD drives with the NEW experimental
drivers for SCSI and a few others specific for SiS boards.
After a few recompiles it solved my long time problem of the SATA DVD
drive not working in the 2.6 series.
Now it works faster than it did in the other OS
A big thanks due to the dev team.
