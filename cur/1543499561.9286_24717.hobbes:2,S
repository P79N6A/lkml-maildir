Ok, I understand, I had thought that if a parent forked, that all the
childrens fd's would come out of the parents amount of fd's, but now I am
clear that any process, even children  have their own independent 1024
fd's.  So I was more than likely hitting a limit of max number of
processes then?  I remember trying to login as "www" (the user that apache
runs as) and it was unable to fork a shell!  So I of course set
appropriate limits in /etc/security/limits.conf so that login would up the
limits for "www".
