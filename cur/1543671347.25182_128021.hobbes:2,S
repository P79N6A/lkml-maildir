Me no understand. I think this *makes* it a contiguous space. The way I see
it, we currently allocate from TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE up to the top, then start
again above program text. Which seems a bit silly.

mmm. I'd prefer a config option. Defaulting to 'y' ;-)

I've moved PAGE_OFFSET around a lot (which moves the stack, as you say). 
Haven't seen it break anything yet ... IMHO it was broken anyway if this
hurts it. Obviously not something one could do in a stable kernel series,
but 2.5 seems like a perfect time for it to me ... unless I'm missing some
glibc / linker thing, it seems like a simple change.
