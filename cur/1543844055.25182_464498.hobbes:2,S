Not quite.  Systemtap does not look at sources, only object code and
its embedded debugging information.  (How many distributions keep
around compilable source trees?)

One additional problem are external references made *by* the function.
Those too would all have to be relocated to the live data.
Live code patching is theoretically useful for all kinds of things,
but I've never heard it described as relatively simple before! :-)
