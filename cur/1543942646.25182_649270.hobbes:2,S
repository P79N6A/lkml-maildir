Right, thanks.
Certainly extracting a tarball can be a surprising challenge
for some filesystems.
And you remind me that of course, to the extent that a load is
about metadata (lots of creates for example), tmpfs can hardly
lose since its metadata never goes out to swap.  But there is
plenty of data in your test above.
