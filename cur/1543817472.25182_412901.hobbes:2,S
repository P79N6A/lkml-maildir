Yes, and one of the fd's have to be a pipe.

Actually, all three of them would have to be pipes. The tee() thing has to 
push to both sources in a "synchronized" manner, so it can't just take 
arbitrary file descriptors that it doesn't know the exact buffering rules 
for.
(Otherwise you wouldn't need "tee()" at all - you could have a "splice()" 
that just takes several output fd's).

I didn't write the tee() logic, but making it 1:N instead of 1:2 is not 
conceptually a problem at all. The exact system call interface might limit 
it some way, of course.
