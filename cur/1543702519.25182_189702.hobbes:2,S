Yup, that's right.  Many people have requested enhanced STP support, and rather
than continuing to do it all in the kernel, the right way to do it is to have
a well-defined API (probably netlink), and a separate user level process to manipulate
the underlying routing.  Then (hopefully with help from the community) the daemon can
be enhanced (or replaced) as needed.
Don't worry ;-) the kernel and system won't break.  The existing in kernel STP
support will stay (probably as an option) for the life of 2.6; to accommodate
users using the existing utils.
