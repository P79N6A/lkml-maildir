Well they're not supposed to fit in.
If we keep permchecks as uid==0 on files which invoke kernel callbacks,
then we can only say once what root is allowed to do.  If we make them
capability checks, then for differnet uses of namespaces we can have
them do different things.  For instance if we're making a separate user
namespace for a checkpoint/restart purpose, we might want root to retain
more privs than if we're making a vserver.
Look I just have to keep responding because you keep provoking :), but
I'm looking at other code and don't even know which entries we're
talking about.  If when I get to looking at them I find they really
should be done by capabilities, I'll submit a patch and we can argue
then.

Not only don't I avoid considering it, I thought I'd even suggested it
a while ago  :)
It sounds good to me.
