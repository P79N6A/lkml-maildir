Hi,
After a SCHED_FIFO task exhausts its initial timeslice, its counter is
never reset. It then starts causing reschedules on every timer tick.
This doesn't alter scheduling behavior but it slows things down
noticeably. 
The fix would be to reset the counter in schedule(), similarly to the
way we do it for SCHED_RR tasks. I'm not going to offer a patch as
Artur's fixes touch enough places in schedule() already. Artur, please
comment.
Regards,
Borislav
