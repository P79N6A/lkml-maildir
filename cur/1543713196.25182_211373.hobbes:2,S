No, it did not. This time I tried 2.6.5-rc3-mm4. Seems the patch was 
already applied in this release. modem_run did not lock (disk sleep state) 
in the same place, but it locked after writing synchronization succeded 
to system log. It seems that there is no kernel-stack-for-process-in-proc 
option in mm (Andrew, can you add it?), so there is no callstack.
but still thanks for your help
and looking for next :)
