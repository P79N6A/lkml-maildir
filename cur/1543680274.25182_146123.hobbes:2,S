Is it smart enough to handle a case like this:
[device resource 00-01]
[bridge resource 01-04]
   [device resource 01-02]
   [cardbus bridge no resources]
   [cardbus bridge no resources]
   [device resource 02-04]
[bridge resoruce 04-06]
   [device resource 04-06]
[device resource 06-07]
Numbers simplified for example purposes.  The cardbus bridges are behind a
PCI-PCI bridge, and in this case, that bridge's resources need to be expanded
to allow the cardbus cards to have any resources since it's already full.
and the top level devices will need to be moved to allow space for the bridge
to expand.  Glancing through the 2.5 pci init for i386 it doesn't look like it
does things differently from 2.4.  IIRC, it's smart enough to handle things
if the cardbus bridge is at the top level (we allocate when the cardbus bridge
driver is loaded), but this will fail if it cannot allocate it (as is the case
when it's behind a full bridge).
