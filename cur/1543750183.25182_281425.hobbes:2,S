I`d like to make excuses in advance if this question was already 
explained somewhere, but i took some effort and found nothing 
satisfactorily clarifying. 
So, in this case i have a subarch-specific block device driver which 
resides in arch/$ARCH/$SUBARCH. Yes, it only makes sense on that subarch. 
Its init routine is module_init()`d and gets called before the io 
schedulers have a chance to get themselves registered. Boom. 
So how do i get my init routine called later?
