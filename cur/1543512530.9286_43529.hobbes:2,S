Write it as a program that can run once or as a daemon.  When run as a
daemon, it checks /etc/devfs.conf to see how it should run, when run once,
it accepts command lines and can read other config files besides
/etc/devfs.conf.  Further, put in a report only mode, so you can see how the
changes would affect the system before you do it.  Add a log with rollback
if you want.  
I.e. make it work perfectly in a maintenance mode before you let it
outta the bag as a daemon.  For many large servers that see little or no
change, a daemon that could blow things up might not be the best choice, but
a program run when you need it program for adding a CPU card or something
would be a welcome change from rebooting.  
For my workstation with a 6 disc CD changer and a zip drive, I'd rather have
the daemon version up and running.
