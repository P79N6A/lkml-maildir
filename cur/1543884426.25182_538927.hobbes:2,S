Unfortunately we need the spinlock here. I'm not 100% sure the irqsave is no 
longer needed since we recently modified the watchdog to run as a task (out of 
interrupt context), but this code hasn't made it upstream yet (it's sitting in 
mm if you're interested).

please don't, see below

I currently suspect that (on this NIC) you're being bitten by a initialization 
bug that was fixed in later patches that made it into 2.6.21. The best thing to 
try for you is attempt to run 2.6.21 in the same configuration and see if that 
fixes it for you. It has to do with a patch I sent to fix the firmware takeover 
bits at startup, something that was definately broken in 2.6.19 and probably 2.6.20.
