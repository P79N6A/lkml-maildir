Sorry for the long delay...

Looks like e100 (network) and intel8x0 (sound) recovered okay.  The
second time I shut the lid, when I opened it the keyboard had locked up.
I've been told that building 2.6.1-mm4, making i8042 and atkdb modules
and unloading them before sleeping should fix this problem.  Is that the
blessed solution?  Unloading the modules for the keyboard controller
does seem a little too much like brute-force for me, especially since
2.4.x managed fine. :)
Thanks,
Ross
