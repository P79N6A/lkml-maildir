remove GPL restriction from set_dumpable()
Commit 6c5d5238 introduced a set_dumpable() function that replaced the 
direct access to mm_struct->dumpable. I don't think there is any reason to 
restrict this function to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() -- previously any module 
could modify current->mm->dumpable without any resitrictions, so it makes 
a little sense to turn this into 'internal interface' at once.
There in fact are 3rd party modules that modify the dumpable flag, and 
this patch should fix the situation for them once again (for example 
vmware).
