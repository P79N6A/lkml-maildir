  Hi Andrew,
  Thanks for the tip. I booted with nmi_watchdog=0 and was able to get a full 
sysrq-t as well as a sysrq-m. Since it might be a little too big for the 
list, I've put it on a text file at:
 
http://193.136.132.235/dl145/dump1-2.6.12-rc2.txt
 I also made a run with the mempool-can-fail patch from Nick Piggin. With this 
I got some nice memory allocation errors from the md threads when the trouble 
started. The dump (with sysrq-t and sysrq-m included) is at:
 
http://193.136.132.235/dl145/dump2-2.6.12-rc2-nick1.txt
 Let me know if you find it more convenient to send the dumps by mail or 
something. Hope this helps.
 Thanks,
Claudio
