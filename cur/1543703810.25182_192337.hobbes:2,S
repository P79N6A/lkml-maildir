> Unlike Andrew, I do believe one can have too many comments. 
How about keeping the comments somewhat separate from the code?
Let the code tell its own story, for those who want to read code.  Let
the comments explain the overall goals and strategy, and perhaps a key
detail or two that might be confusing.
But don't intermingle the two line by line.  They are as two different
languages, that speak to different people, and different parts of the
brain of the bi-lingual.
Make it visually easy for each reader to filter out the 'other stuff.'
