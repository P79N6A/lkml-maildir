Subject: Re: [PATCH] reserve end-of-conventional-memory to 1MB on 64-bit add-on
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/1/115

This patch is an add-on to the 64-bit ebda patch. It makes
the functions reserve_ebda_region (renamed from reserve_ebda)
and copy_e820_map equal to the 32-bit versions of the previous
patch.
Changes:
Use u64 and u32 for local variables in copy_e820_map.
The amount of conventional memory and the start of the EBDA are
detected by reading the BIOS data area directly. Paravirtual
environments do not provide this area, so we bail out early
in that case. They will just have to set up a correct memory
map to start with.
Add a safety net for zeroed out BIOS data area.
