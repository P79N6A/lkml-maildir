Hi,
	I have a question. I am implementing reliable transport layer in
the kernel. I get the data from user tranfer it to the kernel mode, form a
packet & transfer it to the ip layer. The reverse is done on the reciever
side. But the kernel hangs on the server during the initial connection
eastablishment phase (after it gets connection request & is trying to
ack). I figured that it is hanging when the server is blocked & is trying
to call start_bh_atomic(). When could this routine hang the kernel? How
can I avoid it? 
	Please reply to this mail at ur earliest at my email add.
Thanks 
Sandip
