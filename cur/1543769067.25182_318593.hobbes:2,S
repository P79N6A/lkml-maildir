Obviously this wont work since you cannot execute C code nor functions in 
an ia64 fastcall. I need the variables exported.

Nope. You are way off here. Unsynched cpu cycle counters lead to the ITC 
timesource not being registered.

Note again that the use of cmpxchg is NOT covering the case of ITCs not 
being synced. If the ITCs are not synced then no timesource will be 
established for ITC!
This is the case of ITC's running synchronous but at a tiny offset. The 
startup on IA64 syncs the ITCs but cannot guarantee a complete sync. There 
may be a small offset of a few clock ticks. The cmpxchg is 
needed to compensate for that small offset. I imagine that other 
architectures have similar issues.

Again this will not work on IA64 since it does the fast system calls in a 
different way.
Clock jitter can affect multiple clock sources that may fluctuate
in a minor way due to a variety of influences. Jitter compensation may 
help in these situations.
