I'm withdrawing that patch anyway, in favor of a LSM-style approach,
the "cuppabilities" module (cf. the patch I posted a couple of hours
ago with that word in the title, and I'll be posting a new version in
a day or so, or cf. <URL:
http://www.madore.org/~david/linux/cuppabilities/
 >).  In this case, the relative cost will be lower since the
security_ops->inode_permission() hook is called no matter what.
But I agree that the value of restricting open() is very dubious and
it was intended mostly as a demonstration.  So if there is strong
opposition to this sort of thing, I'll remove it.
Happy hacking,
