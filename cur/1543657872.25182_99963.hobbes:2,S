You got my attention with this statement.  I've have Dual Xeon Prestonias on 
an I860 chipset (IWill dp400).  cat  /proc/interrupts indeed shows CPU0 as 
processing all IRQ's instead of sharing them with CPU1 on a 2.4.x kernel.
Is there a work around for this, or is this *really* a problem?  Some say it 
might be a problem depending on how many interrupts need to be processed per 
second.  Others imply that cpu0 catching  the irq's might be a good thing.
I happen to have PIII's using VIA chipsets that dont have this issue with 
proc/interrupts.  This is very annonying, but I wonder if it is worth 
worrying about.
Ron.
