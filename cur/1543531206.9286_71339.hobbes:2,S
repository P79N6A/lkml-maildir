[SNIPPED]
Once these fork bombs start to touch swap, they have to sleep. This
makes CPU time available for a task that already has all the virtual
RAM it needs.
You don't have to make a complete daemon to test. Just launch a task
that sleeps for 60 seconds, then kills the PID that you give it.
Start your fork bomb with & so you get its PID from the shell,
then start your daemon. Remember, you only have the parent's PID which
is a worse case because it takes a long time for the kids to get killed.
Since this is a proof-of-concept, and we want the kids to get killed when
the parent expires, you do not do setsid() for each of the kids.
We all know how to cheat to make such a simple daemon worthless.
I just want to show that the daemon has plenty of resources once
the bomb starts to swap.
The machine will get slow and 'hang'. After 60 seconds, it will
recover when the daemon kills the parent and the children start to
die.
