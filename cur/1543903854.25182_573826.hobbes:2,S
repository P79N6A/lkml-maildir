Hello everyone,
Since doing the initial Btrfs benchmarks, I've made my blktrace graphing
utility a little more generic and tossed it out on oss.oracle.com.
This new version can easily graph two different runs, and has a few
other tweaks that make the graphs look nicer.
Docs, examples and other details are at:
