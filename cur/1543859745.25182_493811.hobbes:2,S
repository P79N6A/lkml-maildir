Who would call end_that_request_first with the new flag set? The scsi
layer or multipath layer?
The end_io_first callout was a hack around the lack of stacking and
because I was not yet sure how to handle medium errors.
We hooked into end_that_request_first, because for SCSI we can get a
medium error and the scsi layer will complete the first X bytes of a
request, then retry the leftover part itself. For this error we want to
update the request and bio fields so that when the request is resent by
the scsi layer, the scatterlist will get made with the updated values.
Maybe if FAILFAST is made to cover all errors then we would not need
this type of hack. Having multipath handle medium errors seems a little
silly though since the scsi layer knows better what to do there.
Another alternative is to do something similar to what bio based dm does
today. The bio/bvec update code and bio mapping and stacking has a
similar problem. In dm we have that bio record/details code which copies
some of the bio fields and dm-mpath also does not do partial retries.
For example, on a medium error where part of a bio is successful but the
end part fails because of a transport error and needs to be retried this
will result in the entire bio being redriven.
