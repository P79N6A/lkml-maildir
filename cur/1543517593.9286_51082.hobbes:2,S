Hi all,
i'm about to upgrade my 2.2.5-15 kernel to the latest stable (2.2.13 i think).
Although a newbie, I feel approximately confident with the half dozens
make's of kernel compiling.
Now the question : in order to patch from 2.2.5 to 2.2.6, which patch am i
supposed to apply: patch-2.2.5 or patch-2.2.6 on the existing 2.2.5 ?
And while we're at it, what's the exact command line.
TIA.
I am not a member of the list, so please make sure to CC me the advice.
ilan
