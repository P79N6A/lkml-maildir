    My linux box has some problems recently. After using computer
for a while(serveral hours or serveral days), the file operation
for example, mv and link, couldn't work. But I can execute these
commands in remote machines successfully(Filesystem shares by nfs).  
    The configuration of my linux box is the following:
Hardware: Athlon XP1700/EPOX 8KHA+/3*256M DDR/TNT2
Software: kernel 2.4.18/XFree86 4.1.0
