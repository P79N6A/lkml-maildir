Subject: [PATCH: 014/017](RFC) Memory hotplug for new nodes v.3.(add start function acpi_memhotplug)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/8/130

This is a patch to call add_memroy() when notify reaches for 
new node's add event.
When new node is added, notify of ACPI reaches container device
which means the node.
Container device driver calls acpi_bus_scan() to find and add
belonging devices (which means cpu, memory and so on).
Its function calls add and start function of belonging 
devices's driver.
Howevever, current memory hotplug driver just register add function to
create sysfs file for its memory. But, acpi_memory_enable_device()
is not called because it is considered just the case that notify reaches
memory device directly. So, if notify reaches container device 
nothing can call add_memory().
This is a patch to create start function which calls add_memory().
add_memory() can be called by this when notify reaches container device.
