No. For now I just leave it as module.

Got the same result when compiled in, always between 12 and 13 MB/s. As
module it is approx. 75 MB/s.
Hope that LSI Logic will find the problem.
Another question I have is there a way in what SCSI mode (320, 160, etc)
Fusion-MPT is running? Could not find anything in proc or dmesg. Adaptec
has the following information in dmesg (and more in proc):
    (scsi1:A:0): 320.000MB/s transfers (160.000MHz DT|IU|QAS, 16bit)
Or has the Fusion-MPT some other tool to show this information?
