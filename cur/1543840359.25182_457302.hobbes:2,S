Ok. Using the following two commands allowed the original oops to be
triggered on an 8-way pretty quickly:
while : ; do usleep 10 > /dev/null ; done
while : ; do cat /proc/[0-9]???*/stat ; done
(where the regex for catching the newly forking/exiting tasks
can be adjusted to the right range of ids being spawned by the
first command)
Applying the patch I sent solves the problem. I'm doing some more
testing and will submit the patch formally shortly.
Thanks,
Shailabh
