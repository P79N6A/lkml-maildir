Thanks. SMP & preempt testing is most important.

No problem.
I just want drivers to be _thoroughly_ tested while we fix them since
a flaky driver can spoil all efforts spent on making bulletproof core
kernel.
What methods do folks use to break NIC drivers?
It would be nice to have crash-my-nic toolset :-)
BTW, I wanted to learn about pktgen, but there's no pktgen in 2.5
(don't know why).
