I've done some more testing this morning, and it appears that the "ALSA:
emu10k1 - Fix memory corruption" patch from 2.6.23.6 has broken digital
output on my SB Live Value card.  Simply replacing the 2.6.23.7 emumixer.c
with the version included in 2.6.23.1 I was able to get digital output
working again under 2.6.23.7.
This does not appear to be a simple matter of adjusting the alsa mixer to
compsensate for how the mixer controls are exposed to userspace.  I have
duplicated all alsamixer settings between 2.6.23.1 and stock 2.6.23.7 in
the "F5" view all controls mode, but still received no audio output.  I
also tried adjusting other volume controls which normally do not need
adjusting, but got nowhere.  It appears that the 2.6.23.6 emu10k1 patch
broke digital output entirely on this card.
Just to add to the information in my first message, the SB Live card is
connected from the yellow jack on the card to the "Digital Coax Input"
connector on my external amplifier.
thanks,
Jim Faulkner
