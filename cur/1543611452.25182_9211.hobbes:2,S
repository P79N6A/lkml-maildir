It's a bit different. Usually the security community uses it
when there isn't a way to fix the code (i.e. non-free code)
or when the maintaner of the code refused to fix the issue.
Also to "expose" the security problem isn't the same as
to flame.
While not a good idea, something like a long name
for a local var isn't a big problem like a completly
broken software with huge security holes used by milions of people
every day.
The quality of the code should be ensured in a different
way. If there is a standard coding-style you should either:
1) refuse to include broken code before the programmer fix it
2) fix it yourself before the inclusion
Flames aren't a good solution imho.
