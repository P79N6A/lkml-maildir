Good question! Disclaimer: Everything I know about kprobes I learned
from Documentation/kprobes.txt
The task watchers patches have a few distinguishing capabilities yet
lack capabilities important for kprobes -- so neither is a replacement
for the other. Specifically:
- Task watchers are for use by the kernel for more than profiling and
debugging. They need to work even when kernel debugging and
instrumentation are disabled.
- Task watchers do not need to be dynamically enabled, disabled, or
removed (though dynamic insertion would be nice -- I'm working on that).
In fact I've been told that dynamically enabling, disabling, or removing
them would incur unacceptable complexity and/or cost for an
uninstrumented kernel.
- Task watchers don't require arch support. They use completely generic
code.
	- Since they are written into the code task watchers don't need
	  to modify instructions.
	- Task watchers doesn't need to single-step an instruction
	- Task watchers don't need to know about arch registers, calling
	  conventions, etc. to work
- Task watchers don't need to have the same (possibly extensive)
argument list as the function being "probed". This makes maintenance
easier -- no need to keep the signature of the watchers in synch with
the signature of the "probed" function.
- Task watchers don't require MODULES (2.6.20-rc1-mm1's
arch/i386/Kconfig suggests this is true of kprobes).
- Task watchers don't need kernel symbols.
- Task watchers can affect flow control (see the patch hunks that change
copy_process()) with their return value.
- Task watchers do not need to know the instruction address to be
"probed".
- Task watchers can actually improve kernel performance slightly (up to
2% in extremely fork-heavy workloads for instance).
- Task watchers require local variables -- not necessarily arguments to
the "probed" function.
- Task watchers don't care if preemption is enabled or disabled.
- Task watchers could sleep if they want to.
	So to the best of my knowledge kprobes isn't a replacement for task
watchers nor is task watchers capable of replacing kprobes.
