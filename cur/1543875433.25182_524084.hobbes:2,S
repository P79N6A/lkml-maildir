Okay, so that's not a problem.

In NOMMU-mode, there's probably[*] nothing stopping a malicious process
running completely amok and changing stuff directly - even the kernel isn't
guaranteed to be safe - so I wouldn't worry about such a case.
[*] The FRV, for example, does have some limited protection capability - but
it is really limited and not really useful in this case.
