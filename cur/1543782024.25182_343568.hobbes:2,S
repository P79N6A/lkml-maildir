The reason for this work, this time, is for UML (it's not casual I'm working 
on it). However, it's true that what I implemented is actually more powerful 
than what's needed by UML.
It only needs (IIRC) to do void (i.e. PROT_NONE) mmaps, and then to remap from 
them changing both protections and file offset. And such mappings must 
support swapout.
This will replace the current use of mmap()/mprotect() done one page at a time 
(when the guest has more than 256 M we easily hit 
the /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count and must increase it).
I've gone implementing and fixing the general thing, including mappings where 
only the protections are changed but which are still linear.
Still, even without all this the patch will still be bigger than when it was 
in -mm last time (i.e. until 2.6.5-mm1), since that didn't handle swapout.
However, in terms of invasiveness, the changes needed to support the nonlinear 
mappings are way bigger than what's needed for protections, especially for 
nonlinear truncation.

Ok, I think this may be reasonable. However, for now I'm still finishing the 
full implementation, I'll start dropping pieces when we've decided what's 
needed.
