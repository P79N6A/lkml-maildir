I agree.  Example bogus warning:
WARNING: arch/arm/mach-iop32x/built-in.o - Section mismatch:
 reference to .init.text: from .data between 'iq80321_timer'
 (at offset 0x428) and 'iq80321_serial_device'
c04088fc d iq80321_timer
c0408950 d iq80321_serial_device
It's completely unclear what is referencing what, what the two named
symbols mean, and even what "at offset" relates to.
What I can say is that iq80321_timer doesn't reference iq80321_serial_device
nor vice versa, and iq80321_timer is far smaller than 0x428 bytes.
