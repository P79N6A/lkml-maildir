No. The problem is similar, involving colliding addresses, but 
critically different. Sizing a device's BAR via memory-mapped 
configuration space accesses will do spectacular things when the size, 
say E0000000, unforeseeably equals the mapped config space address, like 
E0000000. The Memory bit in the PCI Command register must be cleared.
Either a) some other specific sequence exists for safe sizing,
Or b) disabling memory decoding by the device must be allowed, at 
minimum, as a special case,
Or c) a switch from MMCONFIG to CF8/CFC and back again should be used 
when sizing,
Or d) the resulting machine crash is acceptable during linux boot.
The patch, since it addresses d), is necessary unless b) or c) are 
feasible, or a) exists.
Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Patrick
