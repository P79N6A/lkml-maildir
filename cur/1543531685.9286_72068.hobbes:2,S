hi!
i tried running perl software in mvs OS/390 2.8 USS (unix system services)
on an 9672R26 G5 which resulted in one CPU beeing used for something like
while (<FILE>) {
$D=`date -.....`;
.
.
.    (1 db insert, some regexp matchings in perl )
.
print $D;
}
the insert itself didnt eat a lot, but the perl code used 1 cpu for
itself. perl used 5 minutes, normally runs in 1 minute on pii/300, redhat
6.0 (kernel 2.2.10).
would this behaviour change using linux on the 390 (aparently one would
also need oracle for linux on mainframes for this (at least client oci
librararies, but anyway....))
regards,
paul witta
