And you don't need to keep cr3 in the TSS.

I believe the TS value can be inferred from the thread flags except
between kernel_fpu_begin() and kernel_fpu_end().

Interesting, but using 3 privilege levels is not very portable, and
you'll need another per process stack.
Multiple LDT, how can this be useful and what are the semantics? 
There are enough problems with LDT eating up vmalloc space (I believe 
I have a solution to that particular problem).
