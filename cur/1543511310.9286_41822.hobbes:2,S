same message occurs n my logs when playing mp3s (well, i'm not playing any
other sound files).
it occurs since 2.2.12 (if i remember well). now i have 2.2.13pre14 and it
still occurs.
i got:
<ESS ES1688 AudioDrive (rev 11) (3.01)> at 0x220 irq 5 dma 1,5
<ESS ES1688> at 0x330 irq 5 dma 0
it is ISA card. quite old (almost 3 or 4 years).
sincerely
