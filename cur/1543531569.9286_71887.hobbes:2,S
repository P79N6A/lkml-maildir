It didn't.

You asked it if there was 128Mb of VM free; there was. Half an hour
later, you try to use 128Mb of VM and fail. There is a rather simpler
explanation than the nasty kernel having lied to you...

I'm pretending for the moment it does; if we can pretend it doesn't
have overcommit, we can pretend it does have per-user rlimits, too.
We have already agreed that it SHOULD have this feature, and
eventually, it will. If you want it so badly, pay for it.

I loaded a program when there WERE enough resources to support it. You
loaded the same program when there were not. I got the resources I was
allowed, you got the resources available to you.
