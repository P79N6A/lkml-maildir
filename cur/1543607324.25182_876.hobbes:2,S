Note that even when that happens, it's not supposed to be the kernel start
_starts_ the activity of suspension.
An inactivity timer or low battery notification will just notify the
proper deamon, and the policy on what to do should be in user space.  For
example, on low battery you might want to set up a X window warning the
user that the machine _will_ suspend in five seconds. And the kernel
certainly won't do that.
So as far as the kernel is concerned, a suspend is _always_ started by
"the user". Of course, the whole point with computers is that many things
can be automated, and "the user" may not be a human sitting at the
machine.
