His-fscking-terical.  Seriously, what comments do you expect?  To start
with, on a bunch of filesystems inode numbers are unstable.  Moreover,
owner of that file suddenly gets _all_ capabilities that exist in the
system, ditto for any task capable of mount(2), ditto for owner of
root directory on some filesystem.  And there is no way to recognize
that file as such, so additional checks on write(), mount(), unlink().
etc. are not possible.  And that is not to mention that binding of
non-root will play silly buggers with the entire scheme.
IOW, idea is unsalvagable.
