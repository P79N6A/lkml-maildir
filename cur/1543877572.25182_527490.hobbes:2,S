Hmmm... Looks like the object is actually free. Someone writes beyond the 
end of the earlier object. Setting Z should check overwrites but it 
switched off merging. So set
slub_debug = FZ
Analoguos to the last patch you would need to take out redzoning from 
the flags that stop merging. Then rerun. Maybe we can track it down this 
way.
Hmmm... Maybe remove all the debug flags from those that avoid merging and 
then run with full debug. That should theoretically flush it out.
