I withdraw it, then.  Would you please do the renames in your patch?  
Those ought to go in, at least.
CONFIG_ARCH_EBSA285				CONFIG_ARCH_EBSA285_HOST
CONFIG_ISDN_DRV_EICON_STANDALONE		CONFIG_ISDN_DRV_EICON_DIVAS
CONFIG_MAC_KEYBOARD				CONFIG_ADB_KEYBOARD
The duplicate-removal stuff in my second patch ought to still be good, also.
