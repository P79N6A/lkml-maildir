Hello,
I am using an Intel810 MoBo with an infrared module/keyboard connected to
an onboard PS/2 connector.
With a 2.4.x kernel I get the message:
No AT keyboard found
but the keyboard works fine.
With a 2.6.2 kernel, I don't get this message, but the keyboard does not
work !!!
Any hints what I can try ? If I connect an USB keyboard, this will work, and also if I connect a "normal" PS/2 keyboard to that PS/2 pins.
