The problem is that, if you use udev (or iack, iack, cough, cough, 
devfs), the device node is not yet present at the time the kernel tries 
to mount it, although the hardware is physically there. This is because 
the USB subsystem is busy going through all the USB tree, enumerating / 
reseting devices, powering hubs, etc.
I really don't know enough about the internal details, but it seems that 
the USB startup sequence is asynchronous with respect to the rest of the 
boot sequence. This is usually allright (I really don't want the 
detection of my USB scanner to hold back my boot), but in the special 
case where the root filesystem is in a USB mass storage device, it poses 
a real problem.
Maybe someone like Grek Kroah, Alan Stern, etc., can shed some more 
light on this matter.
