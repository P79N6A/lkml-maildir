2.6.11 already has "cpu cores" for x86_64. I would like to retain that.

cpu_sharecore_map sounds like HT logical siblings sharing the core. Initially 
I was calling it as cpu_coresibling_map but later thought cpu_core_map is 
a smaller name.

For /proc/cpuinfo, I want to stick with "cpu cores" and "core id"
But I am open for kernel variable names.
Depending on what we decide on kernel variable names, I will see if I have 
to make any changes to the IPF patch we posted last week.
