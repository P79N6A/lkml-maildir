The screen went into some graphic mode that can't be reset no matter
what I tried (stty reset). I see all kinds of ramdom pattern/color
everywhere. Then typing "startx" would get in X just fine. But trying
to get back to console (ALT F1) or (Ctrl ALT BackSpace) would still
end up with the messed-up console.

VGA console.

Thanks,
