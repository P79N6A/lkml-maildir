He generated that listing with "bk changes", you want "bk changes -v", which
I included below, but doesn't have any more useful info (yet) because the
comments are all auto generated from the email.  
We will stick up a web page someplace that says "send Linus comments
like this if you want individual file comments to be different", and is
totally BK agnostic, i.e., you can send them with a regular diff -Nur
style patch and the import tools will do the right thing.  Then the
verbose listing will start to be useful.
