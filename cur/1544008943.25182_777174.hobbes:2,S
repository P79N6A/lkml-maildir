Yes, true. In that sense, it minimizes the differences between the 
"working" and "nonworking" case. 
Which is interesting in the sense that it makes it even less likely that 
it's an actual resource clash.

Well, I suspect that on Frans' machine, there will be no difference at all 
between your patch and my previous patch, since he already had a bridge 
window allocated by the BIOS. And he also had just that firewire and mmc 
thing that only needed that memory window, so he'd end up with the exact 
same resource allocation, methinks.

It all looks very sane. Too bad it apparently doesn't work.

Yes, however, it shouldn't matter.
Except in cae the audio driver (for example) were to access past its MMIO 
window, and we'd have a situation where we care what was just before it or 
after it. That doesn't seem very likely, though.
