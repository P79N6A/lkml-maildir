Here's the lines I added for debugging purposes...

...and here's the resulting dmesg lines.

 Q> ne.c: Probing 0x380
The actual detail for the card in question is io=0x360 which is the
point at which check_region first returns non-zero, and this is
therefore the reason why the ne2000 driver no longer auto-probes ISA
cards successfully.
It therefore looks like check_region has changed its behaviour
somewhere in between.
Suggestions?
Oh, one thing - I grep'd all the patches from 2.2.5 through 2.2.10 and
none of them patch ne.c so I have to conclude that whatever changed
isn't in ne.c but is somewhere else...
Whilst I'm thinking...
 1. I just noticed that my kernel-parameters.txt file has been
    included with the 2.2.10 kernels. Thanks for doing that.
 2. Did you get either of the two patches I sent out recently?
    One fixed a bug in the top level Makefile and the other
    corrected the fact that BogoMIPS are usually underestimated
    somewhat.
Best wishes from Riley.
