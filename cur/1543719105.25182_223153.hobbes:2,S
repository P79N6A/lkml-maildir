<aia21@cantab.net> (04/05/17 1.1717.9.1)
   NTFS: Add a new address space operations struct, ntfs_mst_aops, for mst
         protected attributes.  This is because the default ntfs_aops do not
         make sense with mst protected data and were they to write anything to
         such an attribute they would cause data corruption so we provide
         ntfs_mst_aops which does not have any write related operations set.
<aia21@cantab.net> (04/05/25 1.1731)
   NTFS: Cleanup dirty ntfs inode handling (fs/ntfs/inode.[hc]) which also
         includes an adapted ntfs_commit_inode() and an implementation of
         ntfs_write_inode() which for now just cleans dirty inodes without
         writing them (it does emit a warning that this is happening).
<aia21@cantab.net> (04/05/26 1.1733)
   NTFS: 2.1.12 release - Fix the second fix to the decompression engine.
For the benefit of non-BK users and to make code review easier, I am
sending each ChangeSet in a separate email as a diff -u style patch.
Thanks!
Best regards,
	Anton
