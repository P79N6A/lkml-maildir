Hi Thomas,
This latest x86 branch build and boot without problem with my usual
x86_64 config.
If you remember our conversation one month ago, I was unable to build
your tree.
I've upgraded my Ubuntu distribution from 7.04 to 7.10 beta this week,
maybe this fixed it.
But I still had to do some manual fixes to get the packaging steps
working:
mkdir arch/x86_64/boot/
ln -s ../../../arch/x86/boot/bzImage arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage
Best regards,
- Eric
