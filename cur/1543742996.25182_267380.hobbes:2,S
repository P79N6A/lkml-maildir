You've just shown that not only do you ignore well-educated people who 
tell you why pipelines can have trouble with "lea", you also ignore hard 
numbers.
Your total focus on a cached memory access as being somehow more expensive
than anything else going in the CPU pipeline is sad.
But hey, I've run out of ways to show you wrong. If you believe the world 
is flat, that's your problem.
