It would make your patch easier to review if you didn't intermingle

Changing the mask may have the desired effect, but it doesn't
show where the true bug is.

I'm only trying to match on the base and sub class fields.  In
the kernel (see drivers/pci/pci.c), the pci device field is
three bytes wide with the programming interface stored in the
lowest byte and class information in bytes 1 and 2.  Since I only
place the expected class values in my table, not the value for
the programming interface, the low byte needs to be masked away prior
to doing the comparison.  The logic in the kernel handles the
mask correctly:
	((ids->class ^ dev->class) & ids->class_mask) == 0
My guess is that diethotplug is not handling the mask correctly
and thus doesn't work with a partial mask.
