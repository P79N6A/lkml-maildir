Hi !
I also have dropouts when playing sound.
For me it happens with two different sound cards SB 16 Vibra and SB 128 PCI,
both kernels 2.2.2 and 2.2.3. Now I am using the es1370 sound driver from
the
kernel. I did not manage to make the alsa driver working. Before I used
the sb driver with the SB 16 Vibra and had also dropouts,
so it does not seem to be a driver problem.
Interestingly xosview shows timer and scsi interrupts going on while sound
interrupts make a pause during the dropout.
I think it is somewhat interrupt related:
Something switching only sound interrupts off (because of scsi load)
for a short (but hearable) period of time.
Or the scsi interrupts just have higher priority so that
the sound interrupts can not do their work.
It does not seem that all interrupts are switched off totally for
some time because the mouse (PS/2) which also has an interrupt
stays responsive. And the load on the cpus is also low at
dropout time. Did I tell you that it is an SMP system.
I sended also an other mail with the Subject:
  "only the sound interupt stops during during sound dropouts"
which should read as:
  "only the sound interrupt stops during sound dropouts"
and contains more information.
Is there some patch or utility to find out what turns the sound
interrupt off or takes precedence over it.
