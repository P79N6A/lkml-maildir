I don't have the answer for your situation, but in
answer to one of your questions I can happily
enumerate the following boxes I installed, all of
which are running 2.4.x kernels on Red Hat 7.1
with excellent stability and performance:
"Name Brand" boxes:
(3) Dell 2450s, Dual P3-1000, 512 MB RAM
(2) HP Netservers, P3-700, 512 MB RAM
Compaq 6500, Quad PPro 200, 1 GB RAM
Self built clone boxes:
AMD K6/2 450, 256 MB RAM, low end ASUS mb
P3-933, 512 MB RAM, Intel i810 motherboard
P3-866, 512 MB RAM, Aopen motherboard
and more -
These boxes either have an uptime dating from
the initial 7.1 install (60+ days), or from the last
kernel update -
