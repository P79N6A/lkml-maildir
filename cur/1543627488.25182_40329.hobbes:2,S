Hi,
Is there a way to directly dump a buffer on an IDE disk from inside a 
kernel module without goig trough user space?
I have written a driver for a frame grabber and would like be able to 
dump the frames real time directly to a dedicated IDE disk.
My frames are already in a DMAble buffer.
Please cc my directly
