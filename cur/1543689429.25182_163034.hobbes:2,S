Original code was:
 static char *IMM_MODE_STRING[] =
 {
    "Autodetect",
    "SPP",
    "PS/2",
    "EPP 8 bit",
    "EPP 16 bit",
 #ifdef CONFIG_SCSI_IZIP_EPP16
    "EPP 16 bit",
 #else
    "EPP 32 bit",
 #endif
    "Unknown"};
I just converted it to the more safe c99 init style, but haven't noticed
the original bug, that is "EPP 16 bit" was duplicated... But this is already
fixed by Andrew Morton on current Linus bk tree.
Thanks Andrew for fixing, Adrian for noticing.
