Both controls can be used to deny service to other users.  For example:
user B locks his X session or current console and walks off to lunch.
User A walks up to user B's machine, switches to another console, logs
in and execs program_that_does_vt_process.  User B will not be able to
continue work unless he/she can get user A or someone with CAP_KILL to
kill the program.  If remote logins aren't allowed, the only way I see
to use the machine again is to reboot.
I think VT_PROCESS (or VT_SETMODE respectively) should be protected with
the same level of security as VT_LOCKSWITCH, i.e. CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG.
