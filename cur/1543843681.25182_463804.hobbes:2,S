When Jeff posted his last version (which got merged), he said that it
would be his last work on this backport. I've been regularly checking
what has changed in 2.6, because often some bugs are fixed, but I see
that the code has considerably evolved since the last resync, and I'm
not even sure that those bugfixes are needed for 2.4.
A full resync of latest 2.6 would require a considerable effort it seems.
Do you encounter any problems right now ? I get very few feedback from
SATA users in general.
Regards,
Willy
