When you add a FibreChannel grid, the devices are discovered in
sequential order, with SCSI IO happening between each device discovered.
In talking to the SCSI people, that should be about 30ms per device
found at the quickest.  So there's no /sbin/hotplug process storm :)
And even if there is, we have to be able to handle such a load under
normal situations anyway :)
