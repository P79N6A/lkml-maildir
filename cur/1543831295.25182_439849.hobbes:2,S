I don't know if I did someting wrong, but it didn't apply cleanly.
So I enable the trace on lastest -mm kernel and I disable the via quirk.
But the printk in the interrupt handler takes some times and hides the 
altstatus delay.
I will try to send you a trace, where I move the printk at the end of 
the interrupt handler.
