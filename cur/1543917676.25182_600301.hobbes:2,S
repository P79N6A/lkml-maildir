To me such atomicity is provided by the "sti" instruction (i.e. the
processor begins responding to external, maskable interrupts _after_ the
next instruction is executed), and there is nothing special with that
combination "sti; hlt" (you can also have like "sti; ret", for example).
So if you define a PV ops like STI(next_instruction), "safe_halt" for
the native should be defined as STI("hlt"), and inlined as "sti; hlt". 
If it's hard or we don't need to expose the semantics of "sti" other
than that, I think it's okay to have a PV operation for safe_halt.
