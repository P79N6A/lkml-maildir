I'm not a lawyer but I think that officially it's illegal to export.
We'll have international kernels soon that include various enctyption

Then again, according to the Wassenaar agreement which the US also signed,
they agreed to some odd clause saying 'if the encryption is in the public
domain then export is legal'.
