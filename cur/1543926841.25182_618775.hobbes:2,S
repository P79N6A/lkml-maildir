Those are interesting numbers. Will incorporate pouching in the next
patch. Even with a data pointer or pouch, the mapping of ri (or
ri->data) would sometimes be necessary. It's required to catch
recursive/nested invocation cases. In case of time measurment test
module, these invocations needed to be weeded out and therefore such a
list was required. Other scenarios might not care for it. E.g a module
which measures the change in some global system state across every
call.
Thanks for the comments.
