On my AMD SMP box, the system boots with no problems. It did lock up on
shutdown right after it showed the nfsd bug.  My laptop still locks up
on start-up  so I need to take a look at it.  It's hyper-threaded and
not normal SMP, although I don't think that would make much of a
difference.  I'll copy over my config of my AMD box to my laptop, and
make just the changes that are required for the hardware, and see if it
boots farther.
When I ran my laptop in UP, on shutdown it also saw the nfsd problem,
but it never locked up.  My AMD SMP box did lock up.
