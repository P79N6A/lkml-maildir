Hi,
The patch in:
  
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0406.3/1399.html
causes the forcedeth driver to fail for me.  See:
  
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=128292
for a description of the symptoms.  Basically it says:
  kernel: eth0: no link during initialization.
Works fine if I back out that patch.
Tim.
