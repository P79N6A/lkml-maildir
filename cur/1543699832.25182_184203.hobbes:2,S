You don't seem to understand how bitkeeper works then. Back when the XFS
tree was cloned from the 2.4 tree, it began it's own "branch". Over time
it has merged code from the 2.4 tree, and it's work has occured over
this same time.
When XFS was merged back into the 2.4 tree, it retains all of that
history in sort of a split road looking branch/merge.
You wont be able to get an "XFS changeset".
