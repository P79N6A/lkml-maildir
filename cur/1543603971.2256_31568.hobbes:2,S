This is also important for USB modems. As Intel requests PC vendors to stop 
including serial ports in 2002 and linux-compatible USB modems are quite hard 
to find it will be really difficult to get an external modem for new 
computers. Almost every new USB modem uses either the ST7554 or the Connexant 
HCF chipset, and at least the ST7554 is controllerless.
