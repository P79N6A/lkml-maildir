I was working on making some sense from all the
constants and discovered that many flashmedia mmc
registers are very similar in bit assignment to OMAP
mmc ones (which are documented). Pity I haven't
noticed it before. I'll take some time now to review
the driver given this new information.

But what with mmc_host structure that also hangs
around? I think it deserves the name "host" even more.
