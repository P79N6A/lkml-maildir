I don't have the possibility to capture it at the moment, I have no
serialports on my laptop and no other computer I can test it on at hand at
the moment. 
But it's really easy to reproduce, just add a:
        cpio_mkfile("/bin/busybox","/bin/sh",0755,0,0);
or something similar in usr/gen_init_cpio.c
