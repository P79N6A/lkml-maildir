I have two problems with your patch:
First, there will be a slub/slab specific mechanism for debug code 
controlled by a parameter in the Makefile plus the common 
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL approach used by most other debug options.
We need one approach for all options.
And your approach could easily result in code paths never tested in 
-mm or -rc kernels exploding in the actual release.
