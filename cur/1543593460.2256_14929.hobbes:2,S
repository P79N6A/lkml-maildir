Hello,
I'm working on some hi-speed DB projects under Linux and I was researching
various buffer-replacement algorithms. I found 2Q buffer replacement policy at
	
http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/63909.html
Maybe it would be interesting to use it instead of LRU for disk buffer
replacement. Seems relatively easy to implement and costs are about the same as
for LRU.
