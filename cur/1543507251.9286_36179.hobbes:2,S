I've seen this before, as well.  I think it happens on any large disk,
but that's purely based on correlation and N of around 5.  of course,
none of the disks in question had any bad blocks; I suspect there's
some calculation that is overflowing.
btw, -b4096 provides a nice performance boost, and isn't a
space-efficiency problem if your files are nontrivial in size...
