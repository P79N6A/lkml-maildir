Absolutely. It's the source of both of the long read bugs you
mentioned. But there are also advantages to having it attached.

I suppose.

No. A page for a 32-bit task can line anywhere in the >32-bit physical
address space.

My not-yet-working code uses get_user_pages and does away with all the
double-buffering and a bunch of the locking issues.

Perhaps not.

Most of those go away with the get_user_pages approach.
