In this group we often release software _before_ it's finished,
precisely so that people can see how it's going.  Make suggestions.
Contribute, participate.  There is no requirement for hard deadlines.
A lot of software is announced and never released.  I think the
complaint is that BitKeeper is in the same category as, say, PC-Tel's
winmodem driver for Linux.  I.e. it probably exists but until we see it,
it may as well not exist.
For some the fact that it won't be free in the freedom sense makes it a
liability too.
