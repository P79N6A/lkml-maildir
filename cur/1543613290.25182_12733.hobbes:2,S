	My mouse is Genius Netscroll, and it also happens during the night
when not in use. It cannot be a power saving, though, because I run
distributed.net client on this machine. Chipset is VIA KT133. There is
an interesting thinng though: I don't see disconnects/reconnects on the
USB keyboard, which is connected via the identical 5m USB extension cable
as the USB mouse.
	I can try to plug the mouse into another USB port.
