This shouldn't be a problem for SELinux, because the /proc/pid inodes
are initialized by proc_pid_make_inode via the security_task_to_inode
hook (=> selinux_task_to_inode), so inode_doinit_with_dentry will bail
immediately on the first test of isec->initialized prior to any blocking
calls.
I asked Al Viro about this issue back when the proc locking change was
introduced (circa 2.5.70), and he seemed to agree that the SELinux code
is safe in this case.  He was concerned about the change in behavior for
d_instantiate, but d_instantiate seems to be the more general location
to perform inode security initialization for the majority of filesystem
types; hooking in iget() would only handle a subset of filesystems.
