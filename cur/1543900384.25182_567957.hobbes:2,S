Subject: 2.6.22 booting hangs after "INIT: version 2.86 booting"

Hello!
I have trouble with booting linux kernel 2.6.22 from kernel.org on my
AMD dual-Opteron 250 system.
The booting stops right after printing line "INIT: version 2.86
booting". Nothing happens after that, but it is not a hardware hang as
keyboard leds respond to pressing Caps/Num lock keys.
If I boot with init=/bin/sh parameter I successfully get into the
shell but attempts to run scripts from /etc/rcS.d/ all end up with
Segmentation faults, e.g.:
# sh -x /etc/rcS.d/S01glibc.sh
++ uname -s
Segmentation fault
I am not sure where these segfaults happen as running programs like
'uname' directly from the shell works OK.
The 2.6.22 configuration is derived from the working 2.6.21 one. The
kernel 2.6.21 boots on the very same system without any problems.
Any suggestions?
Thanks,
Max
