Your advice is appreciated. I will do some further research using
objdump. I believe they use gcc.
One thing I am unsure of is how to approach them and ensure at the same
time that the problem is taken care of. Another words, if I show them
what's wrong, they may simply obfuscate it (although at this time I hope
not) and then I have no way to easily prove anything anymore...
