I've read he start() and stop() code, and I came to the conclusion
again that we don't need them as serio port driver methods. i8042 uses
them to set the exists variable only and uses that variable _solely_ for
the purpose of skipping calls to serio_interrupt(), serio_cleanup() and
serio_unregister().
By instead checking a member of the serio struct in these functions, and
doing nothing if not set, we achieve the same goal, without adding extra
cruft to the interface, making it allowed to call these serio functions
on a non-registered or half-registered serio struct, with the effect
being defined to nothing.
Similarly, it's perfectly allowed to call input_event() on an struct
input_dev that hasn't been registered with the input layer, again with
no effect. It simplifies the driver code a lot.
