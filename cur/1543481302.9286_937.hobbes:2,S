You don't have to overwrite anything. Just copy vmlinuz into /boot and give it
a nice name. Edit lilo.conf to point to it by copying the old stuff (and leave
the old stuff in there so u don't need a floppy if something is the matter with
your new kernel). You don't need to overwrite System.map.  AFAIK, it is used by
klogd, ksymoops and some others of that ilk, and they search /boot,
/usr/src/linux and /, and obtain the correct version so you shouldn't be
bothered unless you plan to delete the source tree, or have more than two
kernels floating around, or more than one kernel with the same version.
