On a system with 4 Kbyte pages, this imposes a tighter limit
if NR_CPUS is > 666.
On a system with 16 Kbyte pages, this imposes a tighter limit
if NR_CPUS is > 2714.
Those CPU counts don't look that futuristic to me.
And it makes the limit more aribitrary ... like what the heck does
that check have to do with PAGE_SIZE ?
How about coding for the possibility that either NR_CPUS or MAX_NUMNODES
is larger, and removing 'cpu' from the comment:
	/* Crude upper limit on largest legitimate list user might write. */
	if (nbytes > 100 + 6 * max(NR_CPUS, MAX_NUMNODES))
