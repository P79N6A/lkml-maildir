NetWare does this too.  If you look at their Y2K "patch" to 3.12 you'll see
that they load a huge number of little NLMs to fix all the Y2K bugs.
I'm not sure I like the idea for Linux but it could have benefits for people
running stable kernels.  The latest exploits could be fixed on the fly
without having to rebuild the kernel and restart the machine.  Think of the
uptimes we'd get then!
Just my 0.02USD,
