Er, if we already fixed that, then what was it which still needed to be
fixed? If the console is registered when the port is registered, what
stops us from dropping the static table and letting the i386
setup_arch() code register the port?
You'd still get the console working a lot earlier than it does today --
currently I think we wait for the console_initcalls to start the 8250
console on most platforms, including i386.
