I had exact same problem when I had both SCSI and IDE drives on my system
(and boot drive was SCSI). If you check out file drivers/ide/ide-geometry.c,
the potential hazard is spelled out in the comment:
/*
 * I did this, but it doesnt work - there is no reasonable way to find the
 * correspondence between the BIOS numbering of the disks and the Linux
 * numbering. -aeb
 *
 * The code below is bad. One of the problems is that drives 1 and 2
 * may be SCSI disks (even when IDE disks are present), so that
 * the geometry we read here from BIOS is attributed to the wrong disks.
 * Consequently, also the former "drive->present = 1" below was a mistake.
 *
 * Eventually the entire routine below should be removed.
 *

 void probe_cmos_for_drives (ide_hwif_t *hwif)

... and it was removed in 2.5. I avoided this by just "return"-ing from this
routine.
