Don't think that would help any in this situation. The thing to look out
for are RT tasks running with a different uid than 0.
This patch would only stop a task from obtaining RT class scheduling
when already in a (misconfigured) group. If the task is RT and then
switches group another - similar - thing is needed.
Does this artsmessage thing also run with RT priority?
