Rafael added this "ssleep 2" because of a bug I reported on LKML, 
see the thread "2.6.18-rc4-mm1: eth0: trigger_send() called with 
the transmitter busy"
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=115565636718377&w=2).
Basically, I was having issues when suspending with netconsole
on my Realtek RTL-8029 network card (ne2k-pci).
But further investigations revealed that this driver (ne2k-pci)
have issues with suspend/resume even when netconsole is disabled
(see 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7082
). These days,
I'm unable to do some tests with latest kernels because my ADSL
router is broken.
The point of this mail is that we should get rid of this "ssleep
2" since nobody else reported such an issue with netconsole and
the network driver I'm using appears to be not so clean.
