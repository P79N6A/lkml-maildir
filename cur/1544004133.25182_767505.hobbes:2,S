Because stop_this_cpu is shared between native_machine_halt and
native_smp_send_stop. It was only moved from smp.c to process.c.
native_machine_halt doesn't require disable APIC for stopping the
current CPU because at this time is already disabled.
The ifdef is another thing and I sent already corrected patch.
