Then your code will never be usable. Some hardware sucks, you have to do
limited polling with a timer backoff. A well tuned polling loop will often
work out nicely providing you are careful. Remember with irqs on you are
just like busy in userspace no worse. You can even do
	while(poll_input()==0)
	{
		if(current->need_resched())
			schedule();
	}
sort of stuff
