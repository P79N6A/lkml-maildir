Technically, it does change correctness: after BLKFLSBUF, the
ramdisk should contain zeroes.
I'm assuming it would also cause problems in tight embedded
environments if ramdisk ram is supposed to be thrown away but
isn't. So maybe not technically a correctness problem, but could
be the difference between working and not working.

Sure, you could do that, but you still presumably need to support
the old behaviour.
As a test vehicle for filesystems, I'd much rather it didn't do this
of course, because subsequent writes would need to reallocate the
page again.
