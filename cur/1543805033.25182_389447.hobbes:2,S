Currently. In addition it becomes more costly the moment you have to
start masking them. Remember the point of this was to virtualise the
pid, so you are going to add a ton of masking versus a cheap extra
comparison from the same cache line. And you lose pid space you may well
need in the future for the sake of a quick hack.

That comes out in the wash because it is already done by process tree
pointers anyway. It has to be because using ->ppid would be racy.
