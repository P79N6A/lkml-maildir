Sorry for bothering,
But i could not find a good resource on the topic.
I'm currently using beta-kernels (2.5.64-mm4/6) and glibc 2.3.2, for taking advantage of NPTL and enabling backwards
compatibility should be safe to configure glibc with --enable-kernel=2.4.19 and 
using LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.19 $application .
is this correct ?
