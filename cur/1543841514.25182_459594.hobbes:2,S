While I understand that it was a bug before, I fear that it could break
existing apps. Are you aware of some apps which do not work as expected
because of this bug ? If not, I'd prefer to wait for some feedback from
2.6 with this fix before applying it (or maybe you're already using it
in RHEL with success ?).
Thanks,
Willy
