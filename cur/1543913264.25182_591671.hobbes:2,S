Is there anyway to get/see what parameters were passed to a kernel module? 
Running modinfo -p <module> will show the defaults, but for example, st, 
the scsi tape driver, is there a way to see what it is currently using? I 
know in dmesg it shows this when you load it initially (but if say dmesg 
has been cleared or the buffer was filled up)?
