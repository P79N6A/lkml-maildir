I don't know about the rest of the world, but I _much_ prefer the old
menuconfig to CML2's menuconfig. While I haven't spent much time playing
with CML2, I'm familiar with cml1's tools and see no reason why they
need changes, which IMHO (so far) are detrimental.
That's not even to mention python issues, speed, or anything else.
