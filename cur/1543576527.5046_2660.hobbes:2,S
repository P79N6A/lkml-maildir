I am wondering why the drivers need such a big contiguous chunk of memory.
For message passing operatings, they should not.  Some of 
the user space libraries appear to need this support.  I am going through 
this code today attempting to determine if there's a way to reduce this 
requirement or map the memory differently.   I am not using these cards
for a ccNUMA implementation, although they have versions of these 
adapters that can provide this capability, but for message passing with 
small windows of coherence between machines with push/pull DMA-style
behavior for high speed data transfers.  99.9% of the clustering 
stuff on Linux uses this model, so this requirement perhaps can be
restructured to be a better fit for Linux.
Just having the patch in the kernel for bigphysarea support would solve
this issue if it could be structured into a form Alan finds acceptable.
Absent this, we need a workaround that's more tailored for the 
requirments for Linux apps.
