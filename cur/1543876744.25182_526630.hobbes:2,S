Hi,
A new version of the per BDI dirty page throttle patches.
This is against 2.6.21-rc5-mm4 with:
 per-backing_dev-dirty-and-writeback-page-accounting.patch
reverted.
These patches should solve several problem we current have in this area,
namely:
 - mutual interference starvation (for any number of BDIs), and
 - deadlocks with stacked BDIs (loop and FUSE).
Dave, would you mind testing if the XFS umount problem is still present?
I could not reproduce it with this code.
