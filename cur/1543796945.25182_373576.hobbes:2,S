Ah, but the GPL hangs its requirements off of "distribution", not
copying per se.  Also note the following statement from the GPL:
	"The act of running the Program is not restricted"
But this is not legal advice, and I am not a lawyer; anyone who is
wants to figure out what they can or can't do shouldn't be talking to
either Alan or me; they should be talking to a real, live lawyer.
