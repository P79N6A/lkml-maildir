Andrey, do not fuck me brains. :-) (translate this to English :-))
No "serious" consequences exist. And not serious ones are surely covered
by the same mistakes which you can make forced to add useless element
to configuration.
I am sorry, but each additional item to configure increases
probability of mistake by... count yourselves. :-)

Rather to cure it amputating dead flesh alien for "ip".
"ip neigh add proxy" was added as a demo of "right" interface
to this feature mostly to have a reason to say several words
about sense of proxy arp in manual. As soon as people do not read docs
anyway (or I wrote some unintellibible shit there) this function
loses its sense.
