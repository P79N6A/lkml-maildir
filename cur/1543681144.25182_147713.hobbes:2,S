Less time than stock? I don't understand you. You can only move them smoothly 
for a small time or they move faster or... ?

Indeed it is artificial, and probably never a real world condition unless it 
was specifically an attack, but it would never bring the system to a halt, 
just some minor audio hiccups while it adjusted.

As it is, the penalty will be no different to what it currently gets to (in 
the same way sched_iso get the same bonus they normally would). The 
difference is once they are moved to the different policy it is much harder 
for them to change from that state, always getting the maximum penalty, and 
being expired each time they run out of timeslice instead of getting a chance 
to be put onto the active array. Neither of these new states is very 
different to what normal policy tasks get except for the fact they dont 
change interactive state without a lot more effort.
