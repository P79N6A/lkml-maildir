Drive letters do not have real relevence from a OS view if talking about MS-WIN

The is no mapping, libscg just let's the user use the addressing used inside 
the MS-WIN kernel.
The drive letter related code was contributed by a russion guy who did
try to find a way to lock a drive in use by cdrecord, preventing 
automount/autoexec. This is unfortunately a bit brain-dead and caused by 
MS-WIN oddities.
