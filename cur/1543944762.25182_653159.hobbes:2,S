Yes, if an application considers nodes to be interchangeable, I'm
trying to avoid having that application -have- to know its current
cpuset placement, for two reasons:
    For one thing, it's racey.  It's cpuset placement could change,
    unbeknownst to it, between the time it queried it, and the time
    that it issued the mbind or set_mempolicy call.
    For the other thing, it's not always possible.  If the application
    is currently in a cpuset that is smaller than it's preferred
    configuration, it would not be possible to express its preferred
    memory policies using just the smaller number of memory nodes
    allowed by its current cpuset placement.  How do you say "put
    this on my third node" if you don't have a third node and you
    can only speak of the nodes you currently have?

Yes and yes, for this cpuset relative numbering mode.

No -- MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES and MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES (which is what I'll
likely call my new flag) are mutually exclusive.
The allowed modes and flags would be:
  Choose exactly one of:
	MPOL_DEFAULT, MPOL_PREFERRED, MPOL_BIND, MPOL_INTERLEAVE
  Plus zero or one of:
	MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES, MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES
  where, if you choose neither of tne MPOL_F_*_NODES flags,
  then you get the classic, compatible nodemask handling.

;)   Your simple "ok" was ambiguous enough that we were able to
     read into it whatever we wanted to.
But I've made my case on that issue (involving the separate or
packed policy flag field).  So I probably won't say more, and
I expect to live with whatever you choose, after any further
input from Lee or others.
