Hi all,
When I plug my board with the FT232R chip from FTDI (USB to serial) a
module named usbserial.ko and ftdi_sio.ko is inserted automatically.
I saw in udev rules that this is the line responsible for doing that:
# Load drivers that match kernel-supplied alias
ENV{MODALIAS}=="?*",                    RUN+="/sbin/modprobe -Q $env{MODALIAS}"
What I want to know is who send this for udev? usbcore module?
The variable $env{MODALIAS} is something like this:
                 usb:v0403p6001d0600dc00dsc00dp00icFFiscFFipFF
v0403 is the vendor ID, p6001 is the product ID, but the others? I
didnt find anything about this in modprobe or udev docs....
Thanks,
