Correct
If this was not the case, background resynchronization of standard
2-disk RAID-1 would be a really horrible feature (with half the reads
returning stale data from the new disk)...

Unless there's bugs in the driver, your description is correct  :)

The really good argument for N>2 disk RAID-1 is still the seek-time and
multiple-readers performance benefits which you won't be addressing with
LVM snapshots.
