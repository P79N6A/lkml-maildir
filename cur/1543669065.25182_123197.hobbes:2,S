Does that really matter? If the user owning the process has write permission
to the file, it can't possibly hurt security that he gains write access as
well to it using flink, right?
If it would prove to be a security hole anyway, it should be easily remedied
by only allowing the call for the file's owner and root. It would admittedly
make the call less usable, but its main uses still remain, as I see it.
Anyway, while we're on the subject, is it just me who would like to see a
fexec() call?
