And if his wrists hurt, he's definitely doing the right
thing by laying off.

I _know_:
8 months in a neck brace due to cervical spine damage
(don't hunch forward while reading cool/clever code).
1.5 years physical therapy for that damage (permanent,
_do not_ hunch forward while reading cool/clever code).
7 months paralysis of left arm (don't put weight on your
elbow on hard surface while reading cool/clever code)
5 months paralysis of lower left leg (don't cross your
legs while leaning on left elbow while...).
The nerve damage can be helped a bit with massive doses of
vitamine B if you're lucky, but they don't fully recover in
my experience.  Bones don't recover at all.. ever.
Remember the thousand times your mom said sit up straight?..
I sure do ;-)
