Yes, you are correct.

Could we determine this in 2.4?
Anyway, how about this assuming sx8 is a pci driver:
	- look in /sys/bus/pci/drivers/sx8/
	- for every device listed in that directory do:
		- `tree | grep block` or however you want to search the
		  tree for the block symlink, find is probably nicer
		  here.
		- that gives you the base block device, then go into the
		  /sys/block/FOUND_BLOCK_DEVICE to find the individual
		  partitions if needed.
Or work backwards if you want to:
	- tally up every /sys/block/*/device symlink, and see if they
	  point to a device owned by the sx8 driver.
Does that work for you?
thanks,
