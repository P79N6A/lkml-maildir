It's actually a generic bug.
delayed work structs are initialised like this:
#define __DELAYED_WORK_INITIALIZER(n, f) {                      \
        .work = __WORK_INITIALIZER((n).work, (f)),              \
        .timer = TIMER_INITIALIZER(NULL, 0, 0),                 \
        }
#define DECLARE_DELAYED_WORK(n, f)                              \
        struct delayed_work n = __DELAYED_WORK_INITIALIZER(n, f)
Note the NULL function, which I used for the key of timers. Thus, the
key is NULL, and the name is "NULL".
Now, this means that my code for the run timer:
				struct lockdep_map lockdep_map =
					timer->lockdep_map;
will actually have lockdep_map here with a NULL key. Once it gets into
			lock_map_acquire(&lockdep_map);
it'll try to register &lockdep_map as the key.
Interestingly, that doesn't seem to be a problem on x86_64, which would
appear to be a bug, the stack certainly isn't a static location.
The patch below fixes it by using the file/lineno of the static
definition as both the name and the key -- using it as the name means
you have a good chance of finding it if something goes wrong, and using
it as the key means we have a good key for it. The patch looks horrible
though. Any better ideas? If not, I think we should roll this into the
original patch.
