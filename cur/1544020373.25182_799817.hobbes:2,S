Subject: linux-next: Tree for February 2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all,
Changes since 20090126:
New tree:
	crypto-current
Dropped trees (temporarily):
	kernel-doc (import failed)
	ide (import failed)
	cpu_alloc (build problem)
	audit (difficult conflicts)
The m68knommu tree lost its conflict.
The pxa tree inherited a conflict from the i2c tree.
The driver-core tree gained 3 conflicts against the parisc tree.  It also
lost its build fix revert (but see below for the acpi tree).
The tip-core tree gained a conflict against Linus' tree.
The acpi tree gained a build failure due to an interaction with the
driver-core tree for which I reverted a commit.
The ext4 tree gained a conflict against Linus' tree.
The net tree gained a conflict against Linus' tree.  It also lost its 2
build fix reverts.
The rr tree gained a conflict against the cpufreq tree.
The firmware tree gained a conflict against the sound tree.
The kmemcheck tree gained a conflict against the slab tree.
The proc tree lost its build fix.
The kmemleak tree gained a conflict against the slab tree.  It also lost
a conflict.
The sparc-current tree needed a build fix patch because of an interaction
with the sparseirq tree.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git
(patches at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/sfr/linux-next/
).  If you
are tracking the linux-next tree using git, you should not use "git pull"
to do so as that will try to merge the new linux-next release with the
old one.  You should use "git fetch" as mentioned in the FAQ on the wiki
(see below).
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
a ppc64_defconfig for powerpc and an allmodconfig for x86_64. After the
final fixups (if any), it is also built with powerpc allnoconfig,
ppc44x_defconfig and allyesconfig (minus CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES) and
i386, sparc and sparc64 defconfig.
Below is a summary of the state of the merge.
We are up to 132 trees (counting Linus' and 18 trees of patches pending for
Linus' tree), more are welcome (even if they are currently empty).
Thanks to those who have contributed, and to those who haven't, please do.
Status of my local build tests will be at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/linux-next
 .  If maintainers want to give
advice about cross compilers/configs that work, we are always open to add
more builds.
Thanks to Jan Dittmer for adding the linux-next tree to his build tests
at 
http://l4x.org/k/
 , the guys at 
http://test.kernel.org/
 and Randy
Dunlap for doing many randconfig builds.
There is a wiki covering stuff to do with linux-next at
http://linux.f-seidel.de/linux-next/pmwiki/
 .  Thanks to Frank Seidel.
