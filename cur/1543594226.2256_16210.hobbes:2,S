Jeff Garzik had some comments here and other, architecture dependent,
propositions.

I do not see how this one is Alpha specific.  Patches from 'ac' series
added one reference to 'simple_strtol' in drivers/scsi/sg.c. Sure, one
more symbol can be exported, but results of this call are used only as a
zero/non-zero flag so an already exported 'simple_strtoul' will serve
instead (or we have an extra export for _one_ call in the whole kernel).
