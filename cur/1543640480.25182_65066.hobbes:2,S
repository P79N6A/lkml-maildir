I plan to make a third pool, reseeding from the first. The code
appears to actually be structured with that in mind, it just hasn't
been done.

Root can decide, for instance, to make /dev/random privileged to some
group if important_set is getting starved by unimportant_set.

Many actually do this. I believe OpenSSL merely seeds though I'd have
to doublecheck.

It might be helpful to think of /dev/urandom as akin to /dev/random with
O_NONBLOCK. "Give me stronger bits if you got 'em" is desirable,
otherwise this thread would be much shorter.
