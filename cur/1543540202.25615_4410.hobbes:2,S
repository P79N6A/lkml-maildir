It's nonapplicable for nodev filesystems, but there is still a
device-dependent string placeholder, which has some meaning for some
filesystems -- e.g. NFS, smbfs or autofs.  Of course, for device
filesystems, it might be nice to have this one actually be a symlink to
the device dentry in use, that would obviously

In one piece, because that is what you would pass to mount(2).

This is pretty much the idea behind /proc/sys and the sysctl structure
-- one data item per file entry.  It is easy to browse automatically,
allows simple tools (e.g. shell scripts) to access it, can be trivially
turned into SNMP MIBs, isn't subject to stomping all over kernel memory
which some proc files is want to do, and most of all, won't be
continually messed around with like some people seems to want to do with
/proc files all the fscking time.
It would belong better under /proc/sys/fs/mounts than anything else,
though.
