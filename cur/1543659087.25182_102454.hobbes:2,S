Bear with me, this is my first attempt at sending the output of a kernel 
oops.  I believe I have all the desired information.  Here goes...
The system appears to randomly lock up, with X running, without X 
running etc.  it appears to be occuring whenever the CD drives are accessed.
The multi question form:
[1-3] I'm not sure exactly how to answer
[4] Linux version 2.4.21-pre3-ac3 (root@wisdom2) (gcc version 3.2 
20020903 (Red Hat
Linux 8.0 3.2-7)) #6 Sat Jan 11 14:29:12 EST 2003
[5] see 
http://www.bubble.org/~jeff/crash.tar.gz
 (includes console 
output from bootup until the crash plus everything asked for in 
"oops-tracing.txt" (I think)
[6] I don't think its possible
[7] not sure ??
[7.X] all files are included in the tar file
I've tried to make the contents of the files self explanitory.
Although I'm not a programmer, I am willing to help out in any way I can 
to find and squash this problem.
Other information...
System Motherboard is an Intel Model# D845GBV the BIOS is the dated 
November 20,2002 on Intel's website.
Both CDrom drivers are IDE and I'm using the IDE to scsi shim.
