-EOPNOTSUPP also gives the wrong error message, as it is a networking 
error.  Any program which knows that it is submitting a correctly filled 
in set of parameters can deduce the reason for the -EINVAL.  Changing it 
otherwise would result in behaviour outside of that specified in the man 
page (which lists reasons for the -EINVAL result).
