When I looked at the same thing, I gave up when I realized that the 
EXTRAVERSION part is actually used in module.h, thereby affecting most 
files in the tree.
Now, you get around this by only including the numeric part of the kernel 
version in the module. That's of course a possibility, but I'd think 
people should be aware that this actually a major change.
(I just looked at modutils-2.4.15, don't know if sth changed in the 
latest version)
a) This change breaks compatibility to current modutils. A module
   compiled for 2.5.30-pre5 will contain only "2.5.30" as its version
   after your patch, thus current modutils will refuse to insert it
   into "2.5.30-pre5". (unless using insmod -f)
   This is of course easily fixed by having a new version of modutils
   only compare the numeric part.
   But then we have
b) modutils will not complain when insmod'ing a module compiled for
   2.5.30-preX into 2.5.30-final (or any 2.5.30-, for that matter). If
   that happens, it of course means the user fscked up. However,
   I think the trend is to make things rather more fool-proof than
   less so, so I'm not convinced that we're on the right track with this 
   change.
Of course, on the other hand the patch means that when going from -pre<N> 
to -pre<N+1> modules won't be recompiled just for the heck of updating the 
version string, but only if something else changed.
(We don't have -pre's in 2.5, so think 2.6, or inserting modules from -djX 
into a vanilla kernel or so)
As I'd guess this issue is somewhat controversial, I'd like to gather 
opinions on whether it should be done or not.
