But if it's a pointer why don't you declare them unsigned long then ?
C defines the long as the integer the right size to store a pointer.
u32 is just a 32 bits unsigned integer, which will not always do what
you're looking for. Having read the rest of the patch, I guess you can
also make the pointer (void *) and avoid a few casts later.
