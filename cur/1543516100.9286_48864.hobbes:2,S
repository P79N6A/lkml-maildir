It does. The retransmit timeout is clamped at 120s, when there is anything
to send, and no timeout when there is nothing to send (except for keepalives,
but these are only turned on by some applications)

It does. The rtt estimate TCP keeps is independent from the retransmit
timeout (tp->rto vs tp->srtt). The rtt estimate only changes based on
new incoming acks, and only for ACKs where TCP knows that the packets
causing them have not been retransmitted.
