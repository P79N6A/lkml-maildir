The earlier kernels were 98% consistent in providing the "cpu_has" information
via /proc/cpuinfo that is true information too.
What I am suggesting is to fix the few places to make the /proc/cpuinfo 100%
consistent reporting "cpu_has", and to provide the "can_I_use" information in
another place (for example with /proc/osinfo or a new "osflags" row in
/proc/cpuinfo).
This way we are 100% consistent and we don't lose the "cpu_has" information.
