Looking at the one laptop with this problem I could acquire access to it seems
that the box switches to SMM mode with interrupts disabled for several timer
ticks. During this time the i2c bus is active and it appears to be having a
slow polled conversation with the battery or something attached to the battery
and monitoring it.
Doing
	while { true }
	do
		cat /proc/apm
	done
made the box visibly stall and jerk doing X operations
