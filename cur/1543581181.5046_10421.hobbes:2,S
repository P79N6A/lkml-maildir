I'm using an Abit KT7 m/board, which uses the same KT133 chipset that I
believe you are all talking about.  Note this is distinct from the KT7-RAID
which has a UDMA-100 RAID chipset on it in addition to the normal IDE
bridge.  I've had no problems with disk corruption, despite turning
everything I dare in the BIOS to "full optimisation" settings - this
includes the "Fast CPU Command Decode" and "Enhance Chipset Performance".
The CPU is a Duron 700MHz, and the drives in question are a Seagate
Barracuda ST310210A on hda and a TEAC CD-540E on hdc.  /sbin/hdparm reports
both drives as NOT using DMA, I might try switching it on and seeing what
happens.
... half an hour later, i actually try it.  Machine appears to be locked
while performing hdparm -t /dev/hda, but waiting to see if it's actually a
timeout.  Performance is abysmal when UDMA is off, incidentally - less than
5Mb/sec from this 7200rpm drive.  The 10,000rpm IBM SCSI drive also in that
machine benchmarks at around 35Mb/sec.
... after about 10 minutes waiting, while adding to this e-mail, the box is
still hung.  Hmph...  *RESET*
