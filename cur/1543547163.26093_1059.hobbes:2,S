It seems I have a talent for speaking too soon, as this was actually not
the problem. I got similar performance to 2.2.16 for about 5 minutes,
then it was ten times as slow again.
I'll still have to look closer at what vmstat shows me after I do the
test with bunzip2. (Laptop packed away for the night.)
I've got everything mentioned in the Changes file updated now.

 Your eyes are weary from staring at the CRT.  You feel sleepy.  Notice how
 restful it is to watch the cursor blink.  Close your eyes.  The opinions
 stated above are yours.  You cannot imagine why you ever felt otherwise.
