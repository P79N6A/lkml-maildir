well, we have an optimization in this area already - if the thread
receiving the signal has not used any FPU registers during its current
scheduled atom yet then we do not save the FPU state into the signal
frame.
lat_sig uses the FPU so this cost is added. If the FPU saving cost is
removed then signal delivery latency is still 2.0 usecs - slightly more
than twice as expensive as a context-switch - so it's not a win. And
threads can do queued events that amortizes context switch overhead, while
queued signals generate per-event signal delivery, so signal delivery
costs are not amortized.
(Not that i advocate SIGIO or helper threads for highperformance IO -
Ben's aio interface is the fastest and most correct approach.)
