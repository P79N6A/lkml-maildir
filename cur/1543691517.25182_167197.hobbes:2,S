Sorry it took long to reply. I setup both a uml system and another
system using the scsi_debug driver so I could step through the scsi ref
counts. The ref counts look ok. I attached a small cut prior to the
unmount. I believe the issue is that in scsi we are using the device_del
and device_put instead of calling device_register. This in itself will
not generate this problem, but to avoid an blk layer cleanup issue the
device_del for sd is being called when ref counts go to zero. This could
be some time after the device_del on the host was called. The kobject
put / release calls follow a standard cleanup path with the parent
staying in place until the last child goes away.
I did use the patch provided by Andrey for our current method and the
oops I was getting was gone which allowed me to get a non-garbled ref
count output.
While the patch seems to fix the problem, the better answer is to look
into what it would take have sd call the blk layer cleanup functions
during the remove even through there are still openers (having this
change in remove_dir may still be a good idea). When I looked at
this last I thought there was a need for a release function in the block
layer instead of calling del_gendisk directly. I will look into this.
