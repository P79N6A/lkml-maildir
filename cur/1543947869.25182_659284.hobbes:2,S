no, i think you misunderstood me. I do allyesconfig testing to make sure 
the kernel is still generic enough on PC hardware - not to catch build 
breakage.
What i do against build breakage is randconfig testing. That catches far 
more build breakage than a few limited number of defconfigs would ever.
More defconfigs would just be a constant maintenance drag, they are 
rather pointless on PC hardware anyway (we'd have to have at least a few 
hundred of them for it to be meaningful as a "default config") and it 
does not really solve the problem either.
