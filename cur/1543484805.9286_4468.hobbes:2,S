How about devices required to boot but easily handled as a module ? Like module
for handling my AIC-7890 ? "Required to boot" and "easily handled as a module"
are not opposited !
  NPU emulation -- required to boot and not easily handled as module
  AIC-7890      -- required to boot but easily handled as module
  procfs        -- not required to boot but not easily handled as module
  sb16          -- not required to boot and easily handled as module
All four variants are there in kernel just now :-)

"Easily" ? Are you joking ? With moves like planned move of rename() from
filesystem-level to VFS-level are forced to redesign all modules (AFS peoples
are heppy to hear about this move, I know :-))) ! So if module will be
saparated from main kernel this will become mantainance nightmare (like PCMCIA
just now).

Some peoples just hate modules and it's just easily to mantain consistency
with current big tarball then with proposed scheme...
