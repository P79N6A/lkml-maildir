I don't know, what the proble, but the fstab workaround  functioniert:
form:
/dev/sda3       /               xfs     defaults        0       1
to:
UUID=7c167a53-30ff-4d47-a206-ce8caf2397ba       /               xfs
 defaults        0       1
in this fix switched form device name to UUID based fstab.
the uuid-s queried with /lib/udev/vol_id program
/*sorry for bad english*/
