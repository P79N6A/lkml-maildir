I've never seen any of this code before and googling several of the 
patch titles turns up this email and nothing else.
Could we get the patches out for review in the usual way please?
Bear in mind that people will actually want to understand how this
code works.   Particularly architecture maintainers.  (I assume it's
portable to non-x86?).
