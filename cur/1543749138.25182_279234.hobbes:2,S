There is a middle ground, in theory.  At least on a NUMA machine you
can divide up the allocation roughly as requested_size/number_nodes.
Round the result up to the next available page size, and allocate
interleaved on the nodes until you've satisfied the requested size.
This minimizes the number of TLB entries required to interleave the
allocation.
However, as noted, the kernel barely handles two page sizes, much
less multiple page sizes.  If more flexible page-size handling
comes along someday this and many other sections of code could
stand to benefit from some rewriting.

Just to bring a bit of closure regarding the patches I posted yesterday,
I'm reading the overall discussion as "The patches look good enough for
current kernels, and this would benefit from multiple page size support,
if we ever get it."  Fair read?
