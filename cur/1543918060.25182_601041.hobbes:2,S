Andrew,
The following patches fix the sluggish writeback behavior.
They are well understood and well tested - but not yet widely tested.
The first patch reverts the debugging -mm only check_dirty_inode_list.patch -
which is no longer necessary.
The following 4 patches do the real jobs:
[PATCH 2/5] writeback: fix time ordering of the per superblock inode lists 8
[PATCH 3/5] writeback: fix ntfs with sb_has_dirty_inodes()
[PATCH 4/5] writeback: remove pages_skipped accounting in __block_write_full_page()
[PATCH 5/5] writeback: introduce writeback_control.more_io to indicate more io
They share the same goal as the following patches in -mm. Therefore I'd
recommend to put the last 4 new ones after them:
writeback-fix-time-ordering-of-the-per-superblock-dirty-inode-lists.patch
writeback-fix-time-ordering-of-the-per-superblock-dirty-inode-lists-2.patch
writeback-fix-time-ordering-of-the-per-superblock-dirty-inode-lists-3.patch
writeback-fix-time-ordering-of-the-per-superblock-dirty-inode-lists-4.patch
writeback-fix-comment-use-helper-function.patch
writeback-fix-time-ordering-of-the-per-superblock-dirty-inode-lists-5.patch
writeback-fix-time-ordering-of-the-per-superblock-dirty-inode-lists-6.patch
writeback-fix-time-ordering-of-the-per-superblock-dirty-inode-lists-7.patch
writeback-fix-periodic-superblock-dirty-inode-flushing.patch
Regards,
Fengguang
