Great, thanks! I tried VESA 0x111 (Linux 0x311) - it is also what is used 
by xfree86 vesa driver, after I've followed the suggestion from Tony 
(cc'ed and quoted below) and tried X with vesa. The kernel boots, intelfb 
driver doesn't exit, I can even start X over fb and it runs! But:
1) both screens - LCD and CRT bocome black as soon as intelfb takes over 
and stay that way also under X
2) kernel logs fill with
intelfb: the cursor was killed - restore it !!
intelfb: size 8, 16   pos 0, 464
Buggy video BIOS?...
