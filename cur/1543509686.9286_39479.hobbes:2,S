I need a tcpdump of a session to judge this. There are two probable causes
since 2.0 is ok
1.	The spiderports don't handle SACK and are confused by the offers
2.	The spiderports don't handle the way Linux deals with small window
	offers and retransmits. PC/TCP has a horrible bug there and the
	results sound similar.
