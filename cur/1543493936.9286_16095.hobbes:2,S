I have been monitering my system for the past few days after two random
lockups.  Funny thing is I haven't seen any.  I have noticed some +-5%
power supply voltage to the 1st CPU under high load.  Is this enough to
cause errors.  It seems like it might be.

P.S.  Whjat is a good temp for the PII to run at...  I guess I mean max
temp...  under full load...
