Thanks for all the useful info.
But as soon as I've applied any patches to my tree I've "pushed out".
So this scheme doesn't work for me.  The first thing I do when I have
changes to apply is clone a tree locally and on master.kernel.org,
then I apply that first patch locally and push it out to master.
What would be really cool is if you could do the rebase thing, push
that to a remote tree you were already pushing into and others could
pull from that and all the right things happen.
A rebase is just a series of events, and those could propagate to
people who are pulling from the tree.  I'm pretty sure GIT could
support this.
