Hi,
Firstly apologies for trimming linux-kernel and linux-wireless from my reply 
to Ivo yesterday. Basically, I replied saying that the patch below didn't fix 
the problem. But please do read on...

 I've bisected anyway and although the results are not absolutely conclusive, 
as I neared the end of the process, I was amongst a bunch of mac80211 
patches. This set me on a path that resulted in me discovering that with the 
rt61pci driver, I can freeze my wireless network connection almost at will if 
I set mac82011's ieee80211_default_rc_algo parameter to 'pid'. if the 
parametre is set to 'simple', the network seems to be reliable. I've just let 
the ping application run on and ping another box on my network almost 1500 
times whilst repeatedly transferring a kernel source tarball by ftp from 
another box and the network connection was mantained That's with the 
parameter set to 'simple', if \I set it to 'pid' the connection rarely 
survives more than 40 pings even without the ftp activity.
If I replace my wireless card with one that uses the rtl8180 driver, the 
network connection seems to be reliable regardless of how I set the 
parameter, although I admit that i have not tested this extensively yet. I'll 
do that now and report later.
Hope this helps.
