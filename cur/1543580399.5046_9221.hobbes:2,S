Nonsense. SMP+SMM BIOS is *very* similar to preemptible kernel.
SMP means that you can run two pieces in kernel at same time. With
preemptible kernel "same" is rather bigger granularity, but thats
minor difference. And SMI BIOS means that cpu can be stopped for
arbitrary time doing its housekeeping. (Going suspend to disk?)

You can dissable SMM interrupts, AFAIK.
