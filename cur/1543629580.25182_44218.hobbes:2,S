2.4.13 used to do (in sound/core/Config.in):
bool '  OSS API emulation' CONFIG_SND_OSSEMUL $CONFIG_SND
The bool verb take exaxctly two arguments, the option description
and the config option itself, if you want additional depencies you
have to use dep_bool instead.
If this fix breaks ALSA it only shows that it has even deeper config
problems - I don't use ALSA and care only about the syntactical
correctness of that file.
