Having thought about this a bit more, I think that something simpler is 
reasonable.
The problem is that get_free_pages is waking something up which hasn't yet run 
enough to set a pointer to its task struct.  However, it is already awake, so 
there's no point in waking it up.  So, what do you think about this:
Instead of 
int try_to_free_pages(unsigned int gfp_mask)
{
	wake_up_process(kswapd_process);
	...
}
we have 
int try_to_free_pages(unsigned int gfp_mask)
{
	if(kswapd_process != NULL) wake_up_process(kswapd_process);
	...
}
kernel_thread would remain unchanged, and nothing tries to wake up bdflush_tsk 
in a similar way, so this would be a one-line patch.
