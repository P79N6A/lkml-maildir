We already discussed this, this is not so important, but how about
	void recalc_sigpending_and_wake(struct task_struct *t)
	{
		int was_pending = signal_pending(t);
		if (recalc_sigpending_tsk(t) && !was_pending)
			signal_wake_up(t, 0);
	}
?
This "was_pending" is more a documenation than a optimization.
Oleg.
