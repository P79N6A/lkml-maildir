   *    1 - It was run on hardware that does not meed the SPEC        *
   *        availability-to-the-public criteria.  The machine is      *
   *        an engineering sample.                                    *

   *    2 - access_log wasn't kept for full accounting.  It was       *
   *        being written, but deleted every 200 seconds.             *

  I've done some testing with SPECWeb99 on 2.5.35 mm1 with and without 
the tcp-wakeups patch backed out.  The addition of tcp-wakeups makes a 2%
improvement in performance.

Simultaneous connections   3049             2982
  The system is an 8-way, 900MHz, Profusion-based P3 box with 32GB memory.
It's connected to 16 SPECWeb client machines via 4 e1000 gigabit adapters.
I'm using Apache 2.0.36 as the webserver.
