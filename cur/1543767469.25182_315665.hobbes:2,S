For scsi the combination of O_SYNC and ext3 or fsync and ext3 should be
reliable. fdatasync doesn't write back all the metadata so depending on
the use may not be sufficient. FAT based fs's I believe you need a
current kernel for full O_SYNC behaviour.

See the manual pages and/or standard.

SCSI shoule be fine, IDE turn off the write cache.
