After having being burned twice: first by Mandrake and supermount, and second
by SuSe and reiserfs attributes; are any of the distributions committed to
making sure that their distribution will run the standard kernel? (ie. 2.6.X from
kernel.org). When running a non-vendor kernel, I need to reasonably expect that the system
will boot and all the filesystems and standard devices are available.  I don't
expect every startup script to run clean, or every device that has a driver
only in the vendor kernel to work. 
But kernel developers need to be able run a standard environment. This effects
both day to day kernel testing and automated test environments like PLM and STP.
I am not saying it is bad that the distributions try to satisfy their customers,
or create a better experience; they just need to stop breaking things, and add
running a standard kernel as part of their QA cycle.
