No. It only affects instructions that would not have completed before a
subsequent (dependent) read.

Exactly. And only these recent assignments, i.e. incomplete assignments, are
relevant to instruction reordering anyway. The processor cannot reorder
instructions for which execution is already over. It can move the instruction
in front of the barrier, but not in front of read instructions it depends on.

But it _is_ possible. The technique is called 'speculative reading' (or value
prediction). The processor guesses the value of q and reads *q before it
finishes the assignment to q. If it was wrong, the read has to be repeated. But
there is a chance that the stall can be avoided.

It has nothing to do with the programming language. Of course data dependencies
have to be respected. But while the processor ensures data consistency of the
program it is running, instruction reordering can have undesired effects when
data is shared with programs running on other processors.
Let's analyze the example from include/asm-i386/system.h:
 * For example, the following code would force ordering (the initial
 * value of "a" is zero, "b" is one, and "p" is "&a"):
 *
 * <programlisting>
 *      CPU 0                           CPU 1
 *
 *      b = 2;
 *      memory_barrier();
 *      p = &b;                         q = p;
 *                                      read_barrier_depends();
 *                                      d = *q;
 * </programlisting> 
The memory_barrier() on CPU 0 ensures that if p points to b, b already has the
value 2 and not its original value 1 any more. So if q is assigned the value p
on CPU 1, it subsequently points to either a (which is still zero) or to b, in
which case we would expect *q to give the value 2.
If, on the other hand read_barrier_depends() was not there, the processor could
try to predict the value of q and read *q before p is assigned to q. Consider
the following case (actual order of execution):
        CPU 0                   CPU 1
                                d = *q; // predict q to become pointer to b
        b = 2;
        memory_barrier();       [ ... other instructions ... ]
        p = &b;
                                q = p;  // q points to b, prediction
                                        // turns out to be correct
Now d suddenly has the value 1, even though p never pointed to a variable
holding that value!
