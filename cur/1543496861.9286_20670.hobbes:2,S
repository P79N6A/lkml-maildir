Ah, I overlooked the implementation. What we care is to only run mmx if
there is no FPU data to clobber (but we can run mmx even if the current
task used math in some previous timeslice). So the right implementation
should be this according to me:
	if (!(current->flags & PF_USEDFPU))
		checksum_mmx();
	else
		checksum_nommx();
