If you really need to run atomically, that gets ugly.  Even of one were to
run handle_mm_fault() by hand, it still needs to allocate memory.
Two ugly options might be:
a) touch all the pages, then go atomic, then touch them all again.  If
   one of them faults (ie: you raced with swapout) then go back and try
   again.  Obviously susceptible to livelocking.
b) Do get_user_pages() against all the pages, then go atomic, then do
   put_page() against them all.  Of course, they can immediately get
   swapped out.
But that function's already racy against swapout and I guess it works OK. 
I don't have clue what it is actually trying to do, so I'm guessing madly
here.
