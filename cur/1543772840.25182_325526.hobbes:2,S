I found another system which exhibits the problem, a dual Xeon
with HT support.
Here is one of the cpus from /proc/cpuinfo

I discovered that if I disable P4 support on this host and run with
P3 Xeon support instead, things start working. The host type in the
boot up is identified as a P4/Xeon:
Jun 14 11:25:19 k4 kernel: Booting processor 2/2 eip 3000
Jun 14 11:25:19 k4 kernel: CPU 2 irqstacks, hard=c03e7000 soft=c03df000
Jun 14 11:25:19 k4 kernel: Initializing CPU#2
Jun 14 11:25:19 k4 kernel: CPU: Trace cache: 12K uops, L1 D cache: 8K
Jun 14 11:25:19 k4 kernel: CPU: L2 cache: 256K
Jun 14 11:25:19 k4 kernel: CPU: L3 cache: 512K
Jun 14 11:25:19 k4 kernel: CPU: Physical Processor ID: 1
Jun 14 11:25:19 k4 kernel: Intel machine check architecture supported.
Jun 14 11:25:19 k4 kernel: Intel machine check reporting enabled on CPU#2.
Jun 14 11:25:19 k4 kernel: CPU2: Intel P4/Xeon Extended MCE MSRs (12) available
Jun 14 11:25:19 k4 kernel: CPU2: Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 1.40GHz stepping 01
So is this some P4 specific optimization which is not working as
intended?
