To date, there hasn't been a credible alternative to dealing with
fragmentation. Breaking the 1:1 virtual:physical mapping and defragmenting
would incur a serious performance hit.

It may not even need that that much effort. The most stressful use of the

is a deliberate action by the user.

It is easier to read all right and may be worth doing anyway.
