Hi,
	I'm not the real maintainer, I'm just part of the "editorial
board" ;-)
	The real maintainer is Andre Balsa who has been missing from the
Internet since last October (Andre are you there?).  He's the one with
access to the server.  Even though I would like to help with this, my time
of lately is really compressed, so if someone else wants to take up the
job please go ahead.  I've been acumulating a few submissions to the faq,
and these can be added anytime.  Also some material in it could use some
updating.  Any takers?
	Cheers,
		Rafael
