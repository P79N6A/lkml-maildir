when benchmarking, please be careful that you don't end up benchmarking 
umount/mount, or sync, or..... it can be remarkably hard to avoid such 
mistakes.....
I tend to try to use large enough filesets that small things like cache 
flush happenstance or bitmap loading overhead do not sway the benchmark.
Rebooting tends to work for resetting the OS thoroughly, though I would 
be curious to hear comments on whether one ought to power down the disk 
drive so that its cache flushes......;-)
