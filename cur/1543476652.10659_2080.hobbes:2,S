According to Linus Torvalds:
> There's a "pre-7.gz" on ftp.kernel.org in testing, anybody interested?
Got it, like it -- *except* the fix for overflow in do_poll() is a
little bit off.  Quoting testing/pre-7:
	if (timeout) {
		/* Carefula about overflow in the intermediate values */
		if ((unsigned long) timeout < MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT / HZ)
			timeout = (timeout*HZ+999)/1000+1;
		else /* Negative or overflow */
			timeout = MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT;
	}
However, the maximum legal millisecond timeout isn't (as shown)
MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT/HZ, but rather MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT/(1000/HZ).
So this code will turn some large timeouts into MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT
unnecessarily.
Therefore, I suggest this patch:
Index: fs/select.c
*************** asmlinkage int sys_poll(struct pollfd * 
*** 336,346 ****
  		goto out;
  
! 	if (timeout) {
! 		/* Carefula about overflow in the intermediate values */
! 		if ((unsigned long) timeout < MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT / HZ)
! 			timeout = (timeout*HZ+999)/1000+1;
! 		else /* Negative or overflow */
! 			timeout = MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT;
! 	}
  
  	err = -ENOMEM;
--- 336,343 ----
  		goto out;
  
! 	if (timeout < 0)
! 		timeout = MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT;
! 	else if (timeout)
! 		timeout = ROUND_UP(timeout, 1000/HZ);
  
  	err = -ENOMEM;
