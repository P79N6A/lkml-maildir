	Wow!  I have seen the future, and it works!  It turns out that
the latest version of modprobe already recurses through the
subdirectories of /lib/modules/<version>/kernel.  Your patch, which
you attached to your previous message, also worked (aside from the
need to remove the "MAKING_MODULES=1" make argument that is no longer
used in the current kernels).  This is exactly the module selection
that facility that I wanted, in order to automate the creation of
small systems like boot floppies.  I have checked your kernel into our
source tree.  How about if you submit your patch to Linus, and I
(and hopefully others) will ask him to integrate it?

	The following is a pretty minor point, and does not necessarily
need to be addressed simultaneously with your patch:

	This is not a big issue to me, but I would be curious as
to which utilities rely on that staging area and how difficult it
would be to adjust them.  As for error detection, you could actually
do better detection without the staging area, because then you can
more easily tell where both of the colliding module names came from.
For example, you could put something like this in the modules_install
make rule:
	conflicts="$$(find /lib/modules/$(VERSION)/ -type f | \
		sed 's|.*||' | sort | uniq -d)" ; \
	if [ -n "$conflicts" ] ; then \
		echo "Warning: duplicate modules names:" $$conflicts ; \
	fi
