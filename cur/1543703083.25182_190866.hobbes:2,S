| I'm getting similar messages from dmesg after upgrading to 2.6.1, too:
| 
| request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- n. error = 256
| 
| [drees@summit drees]$ /sbin/modprobe -V
| module-init-tools version 3.0-pre5
| [drees@summit drees]$

| Running on Fedora Core 1 compiled with gcc 3.3.2.  Didn't see these with

Yes, I see a couple of similar messages:
request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- parport_lowlevel. error = -16
request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- fb0. error = 256
...?
