If you read the docs from the iproute tools and are using a modern kernel,
equal-cost multipath routing is possible but masquerading screws it up.
Once a session starts and is masqueraded as a particular address, it must
remain masqueraded to that address until the session terminates. This
means that at best you can get is session-by-session and not 
packet-by-packet multipath using masquerading.
