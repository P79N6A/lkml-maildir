I agree that my patch is not the perfect solution for max_loop problem.
But it nearly doubles max_loop for me (using 386 arch) and moreover it 
is a FIX for incorrect implementation in kernel IMHO. So I can see 
REASON to include it in Kernel. Do I cry at the correct tomb? :)

I'm not any professional kernel hacker, so I don't understand the 
mysteries regarding ** (pointers to pointers?). Is there anyone who 
could provide CLEAN patch for loop.c, which would raise the max_loop 
limit to (at least) 1024 and which would be ACCEPTED to mainline kernel 
any soon?
I'm offering MONEY for this task.
Let's say $256 ;-)
I hope I didn't offend anyone by this offer.
