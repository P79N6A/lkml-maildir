It would be more reliable, certainly. However, this is likely not what
Vojtech has intended. I do not understand how this code functions,
and I would be ashamed just adding NULL checks all over the place.
Also, the original oops happens after a certain field was accessed,
not at an argument. It's not quite clear to me what happened, because
of optimizations, but I suspect this may be it.
