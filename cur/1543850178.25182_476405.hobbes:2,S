Just as an FYI, I bisected it down to this commit:

    PCI: optionally sort device lists breadth-first
which makes no sense.  Effectively all this changeset does is add some
__init section code to the PCI layer which never gets executed on
non-i386.  And even on i386 it only runs if you give a special kernel
command line option.
So the only side effect of this code for sparc64, by checking the
System.map before/after this change, is to move the __init_end ahead
by 1 PAGE_SIZE.
It's probably some sparc64 issue, maybe even some error wrt.  freeing
up init memory.  I'll try to track it down.  I'm actually quite
curious what this bug is :-)
