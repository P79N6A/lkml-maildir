ok - there were indeed some warnings :-)
Sorry, my report wasn't comlete. I totally forgot to mention that this is not 
a new bug. I saw it with every kernel since about 2.3.14 that I managed to 
compile.
There are actually even more problems:
 - serial port autodetection makes serial console unusabele and 
   setserial segfault (already reported to tytso)
 - isdn card not detected (AVM Fritz!PCI)
 - Ati Mach64 PCI card not detected in XFree86. Textmode is ok.
 curiously the onboard PCI SCSI controller works.
In 2.3.10 this all works fine.
I am not fit enough to debug that on my own but I'll do any tests you 
like me to do!
