I must be misreading this, it looks to me as though having threads running
HT is reducing the clock time, and frankly that's what I want. It may not
be as good as having more processors, but it certainly is better for
nothing, even for your application. I read that as about 10% faster, and I
know people who spend more on fans to o/c their CPU than the premium for a
Xeon.
More to the point, since you have no choice if you want to go fast or have
>2 CPUs, you get HT included. Clearly if you want good latency you don't
run SMP at all due to the extra locking, that's a kernel issue, not HT.
