Hello everyone,
	Please excuse the intrusion... I have a load of old machines (or
rather bits and pieces of them) and would like to stack them into a
network (an then one parallel machine) ... The problem is space ... can
anyone advise me as to a way of stripping out the innards of each machine
and mounting them on some frame (does one exist?) and sticking the whole
thing under my table. This of course leads to the second issue ... the
power supplies ...there will be so many of them lying around ... is it
possible to tap from one PSU for multiple boards? ...then there is the
issue of the inter-board space (each one with its own set of cards ..) 
	I would welcome any and all (non-incendiary) suggestions concerning
this and please copy me (pref. to the reply-to-address given) when you are
responding to this mail. 
	Thanks
