You probably don't get underruns because your machine is fast.  Mine is
a 600Mhz Via board, but I know this is an mplayer ALSA driver bug
because it works perfectly with -ao oss, and because mplayer's ALSA
driver maintainer has acknowledged the bug.

I think the problem is also due to mplayer's faulty design.  It should
be multithreaded and use RT threads for the time sensitive work, like
all professional AV applications and many other consumer players do.
