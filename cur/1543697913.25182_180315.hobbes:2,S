Yes, these people not caring just open a SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM. I
don't see any field in msghdr, which contains the time.
Other people have packet sockets (or other special stuff) opened, which
is usally bound to a device or to a special RX/TX path. So we know,
which device does need it and which not.
If in doubt, there could be an sysctl option for exact time per device
or for all.
But I'm not really that familiar with the networking code, so please
ignore my ignorance on any issues here.
