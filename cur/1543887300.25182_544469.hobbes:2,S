sysfs is an even bigger desaster.  Even if people know they can't break
userspace apis sysfs can force it on them.  As long as we tightly couple
kernel data structures and a userspace ABI that's unavoidable.  Unfortunately
sorting that mess out properly would be such a massive amount of work
that it'd alsmost require a 2.7 series.
