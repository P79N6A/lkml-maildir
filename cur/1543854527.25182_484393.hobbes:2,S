There are three minor problems with this approach:
 - some ballast in system memory for the dummy driver struct
 - the dummy driver is visible in sysfs
 - the (root) user can unbind the driver which will recreate the
   preconditions for the deadlock
Nevertheless, here is the patch. I find it ugly, maybe even more so than
my previous up(&dev->parent->sem) hack, but it works as you said.

Subject: ieee1394: nodemgr: fix deadlock in shutdown
If "modprobe ohci1394" was quickly followed by "modprobe -r ohci1394",
say with 1 second pause in between, the modprobe -r got stuck in
uninterruptible sleep in kthread_stop.  At the same time the knodemgrd
slept uninterruptibly in bus_rescan_devices_helper.
This was a regression since Linux 2.6.16,
	commit bf74ad5bc41727d5f2f1c6bedb2c1fac394de731
	"Hold the device's parent's lock during probe and remove"
The fix (or rather workaround) adds a dummy driver to the hpsb_host
device.  Now bus_rescan_devices_helper won't scan it anymore.  This
doesn't hurt since we have no drivers which will bind to these devices
and it is unlikely that there will ever be such a driver.
