because a lot of parts of the kernel think and work in milliseconds,
it's logical and USEFUL to at least provide an interface that works on
milliseconds.

an interface should try to map to the implementation that provides the
best implementation quality of the requested thing in general. That's
the hrtimers based msleep(). For cases where you're ok to compromise on
this behavior, you can add to the api.. it's the logical thing to do to
get the least surprises and the best normal behavior.

having a nanosleep *in addition* to msleep (or maybe nsleep() and
usleep() to have consistent naming) sounds reasonable to me.
Do you have something against hrtimer use in general? From your emails
on this msleep topic it sort of seems you do....
