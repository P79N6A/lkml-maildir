Version 0.9.9 has been released on the driver home page,
http://gtf.org/garzik/drivers/8139too/
   An update is also headed to
Linus.
It includes your fix (thanks!) and a smaller, tighter Rx interrupt
handler.  More changes are in the works, but please give this driver
some testing and try to break it.
Thanks all,
	Jeff
