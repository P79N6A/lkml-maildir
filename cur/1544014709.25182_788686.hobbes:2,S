Yes, 2 isn't feasible for regular mutexes as we have non-atomic owner
tracking.
I've since realized the whole rtmutex thing is fundamentally difference
on a few levels:
  a) we have atomic owner tracking (that's the lock itself, it holds the
task_pointer as a cookie), and 
  b) we need to do that whole enqueue on the waitlist thing because we
need to do the PI propagation and such to figure out if the current task
is even allowed to acquire -- that is, only the highest waiting and or
lateral steal candidates are allowed to spin acquire.
