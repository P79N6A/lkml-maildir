First of all, your proposed patch seems to be broken WRT gcc < 3.1 .

How can a compiler decide whether an "inline" was for a possible small  
speed benefit or whether it's required for correct working?
And I'm not that happy with the fact that gcc 3.3 and gcc 3.4 will 
produce significantly different code for the same file. Besides from the  
3 dozen compile errors I'm currently sorting out, gcc 3.3 and 3.4 should 
behave similar with __attribute__((always_inline)).
