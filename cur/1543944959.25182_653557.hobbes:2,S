The problem is, what do you do if the filename would be:
tempfile.<TIMESTAMP>
where <TIMESTAMP> is replaced by the unix timestamp. I mean how do you 
redirect to /dev/null if you don't know in advance the filename your 
application will create.
Its true the quick way would be to write a filesystem in Perl with fuse. 
But it would be better to implement this natively in the kernel, because 
there is a loss of performance in fuse between the communication of the 
fuse client and the fuser server (it uses a socket mechanism).
