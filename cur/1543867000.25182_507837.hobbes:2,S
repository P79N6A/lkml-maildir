Question on using modules with kernel. 
I've been building the latest git kernels for the G4L project, 
and the latest 
kernels have added support for a lot of newer hardware, but 
currently have 
two of the nic drivers that cause problems when build into 
the kernel. 
DEPCA causes a kernel panic. 
TLAN just stops during the boot. 
Without these, the kernel boots fine. Unfortunately, I don't 
have either of 
these cards, so built it with these as modules, and put the 
.ko files in the 
/lib/modules/2.6.20 directory. Would the instructions for a 
user that does 
have one of these cards just to use insmod? 
I generally have about 9000 downloads per month of the 
project files, so 
would assume that some users would have these cards. 
Thanks.
