I would give your application this capability (from #include "linux/capability.h")
  /* Allows binding to TCP/UDP sockets below 1024 */
  /* Allows binding to ATM VCIs below 32 */
  #define CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE 10
You do this with a setuid wrapper which drops all capabilities but
that one and then runs your application.
One day there will be a way of doing this in the filing system, so
instead of doing a chmod u+s you do a chmod +CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE or
something!  Until then use a setuid wrapper....
Here is a FAQ
  
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/kernel-2.4/capfaq-0.2.txt
Actually the FAQ mentions sucap which seems to be a fairly standard
program (its in Debian anyway!).  You could use this too...
