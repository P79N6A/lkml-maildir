Except you can't do the fixup on SMP without risking hitting the CPU
errata. You also break debugging tools that map kernel code pages r/o
and people who ROM it.
The latter aren't a big problem (they can compile without runtime
fixups). For the other fixups though you -have- to do them before you
run the code. That isnt hard (eg sparc btfixup). You generate a list of
the addresses in a segment, patch them all and let the init freeup blow 
the table away
