Hi David,
It seems I fubar'd. I recompiled the module and run it through the test
again... no hang. It looks like I forgot to copy the new module into my
/lib/modules/<blah>. Apologies for messing up there.
Anyway... the new driver still drops packets after the initial RX
overflow, so I had a poke around with it and I've seen some definate
improvement by forcing the whole chip to reset when the RX overflows.
My modifications to the driver are evil and I only intend them to be a
test, but it helps to shed some extra light on what's going on.
When the chip does a full reset I loose a whole load of packets, but I'm
guessing this is normal :(
Also, I can't remember where I read it, but the Extreme Summit 48 is
supposed to support *receiving* the xon/xoff Pause stuff (I'm no expert
in this area, so I could be talking complete twaddle!), no transmit
capability though.
Here's what I get out of the module when it resets (with my limit=5000
mod);
eth0: RX buffer overflowed - running rxmac_reset
eth0: RX MAC resetting
eth0: RX MAC *ONLY* reset
eth0: RX MAC reset ok?
eth0: RX MAC will not disable, resetting whole chip.
eth0: PCS AutoNEG complete.
eth0: PCS link is now up.
Without the limit=5000, it appears that the module detects the RX
section is "un-hung" when it isn't.
Cheers,
Beezly
