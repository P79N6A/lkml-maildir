Yes, it is important that for TCP, for example, we don't give
the user the event until the data is acknowledged and the skb's
referencing that data are fully freed.
This is further complicated by the fact that packetization boundaries
are going to be different from AIO buffer boundaries.
I think this is what you are alluding to.
