gcc begs to differ
/* z.c */
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    printf("This is a string\n\
with continuation characters\n");
    return 0;
}
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -ansi z.c -o z
[silence]
Remove the \ and you get
z.c:5: warning: string constant runs past end of line
z.c: In function `main':
z.c:5: warning: ANSI C forbids newline in string constant
You are correct in thinking it is something to do with pre-processor -
it deals with these continuation lines eg,
$ gcc -E -Wall -pedantic -ansi z.c
Gives
[snip stdio etc]
int main(void)
{
    printf("This is a string\nwith continuation characters\n");
    return 0;
}
