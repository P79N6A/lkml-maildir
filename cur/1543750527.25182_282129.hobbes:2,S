Why not use the same system as the Debian package uses? That runs
everything in /etc/kernel/postinst.d/ after installing and everything
in /etc/kernel/prerm.d/ before removing a package.
That is much more flexible than hardcoding something like mkinitrd or
new-kernel-package: it works on all architectures and gives the
administratie full freedom to hook into things.
