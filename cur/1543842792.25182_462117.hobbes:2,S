I just changed the defines to functions without thinking about this.. :)

Yes, even s390 has page_to_phys() as well. But why is it in io.h? Seems
like this is inconsistent across architectures. Also in quite a few
architectures the define looks like this:
#define page_to_phys(page)	((page - mem_map) << PAGE_SHIFT)
A pair of braces is missing around page. Yet another possible subtle bug...

Yes, I will address that in a later patch. Shouldn't stop this one from
being merged, if there aren't any other objections.
Thanks for pointing this out!
