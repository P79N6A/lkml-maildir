The boot sector bootloader is broken for anything but genuine legacy
floppies, because it relies on getting the proper sector not found in
order to determine the geometry.  Most LBA<->CHS conversions -- and
that includes El Torito, IDE floppies, USB floppies, and just about
anything else that isn't a classical legacy floppy -- simply spill
into the next track, confusing bootsect.S.  This is part of why
bootsect.S is gone in 2.5.
