It said
	unmounting local filesystems... bio too big device sdc1 (8 > 0)
	bio too big device sdc1 (8 > 0)
	journal - 601, buffer write failed
	--- cut here ---
	kernel BUG at fs/reiserfs/prints.c: 339
	:
To me the problem seems that the USB stuff is shutdown
without unmounting the external USB disk first. Later, at
the "unmounting all disks" step in the shutdown procedure
the USB storage device can't be accessed anymore.
