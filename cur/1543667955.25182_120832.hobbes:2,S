Hmm actually that's a leftover from when we played with bigger queue
sizes, I inadvertently forgot to change it back when pushing the rbtree
deadline update to Linus. It used to be 256. We can shrink this to 2^7
or 2^8 instead, which will then only eat 1-2K.

No real issues to shrinking it, bigger problem if we move to larger
queues. With the rq-dyn-alloc patch, we can make the max number of
requests ceiling a lot higher and then the hash needs to be bigger too.
But for now, 256 entry should be a good default and suffice for the
future, I'll push that change.
