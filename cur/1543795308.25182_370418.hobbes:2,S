I think that can safely die, that code even predates me maintaining it.
It's a bug to receive a request that's not hardsector aligned. It used
to be a problem with eg hfs cds, since they use 512b sectors. But the
caching should take care of it for us, it's definitely not driver
business.
So rip it!
