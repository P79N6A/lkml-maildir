Heh, I've seen real comments in the past that sure look like "no
comments or obscure comments".  This is usually done by people who don't
like to or know how to use checking comments correctly, not them trying
to hide info purposely :)

One problem might be having access to a public BK server.  I know lots
of people who do not want to run BK on a publicly accessible server,
if for no other reason of not likening to run _any_ program they don't
have to on a publicly available server.
Other companies also have restrictions on allowing programs to be run
outside of their firewalls.  If they want to use bk on a project, with
this license change, they would have to convince the IT group to set up
a bk server for their repository, which at larger companies is very hard
to do :)
You might have to beef up bkbits.net if this change goes into effect,
just to handle the extra repositories that might show up there.
Personally I don't care about the license change, as all my repositories
are placed on bkbits.net, and I understand your frustrations with people
trying to work around the spirit of your license.
Good luck,
