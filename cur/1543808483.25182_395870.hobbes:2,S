Well it is all very well to just make up this case but I don't
see what it proves (eg. some application may actually work better
if creat is implemented with unlink to be extreme). But I'll try
to humour you :)
Being a logging program it would appear to have some data integrity
requirements, and as such I would guess it is going to use MS_SYNC
in the very near future before writing another entry to the log
(in case a crash happens while generating the next entry).
However the fact the MS_ASYNC is even called in the first place
indicates to me that there must be some window before the MS_SYNC
point (for whatever reason). So I would really want MS_ASYNC to
actually send the page to backing store asap in order to get some
pipelining going.

I wouldn't expect any IO there at all because there would be no
"dangling" MS_ASYNC, and there would be no random clowns writing
to our very important log. But just on the off chance that there
was some IO going on:

3 is obviously wrong because it blocks. 1 is what we have now which
I'm arguing against (on efficiency grounds). So that leaves us with 2,
which is an acceptable compromise for a situation which isn't likely
to come up much with a well coded app.

Yes (and I'd likewise argue that an efficient FADV_WRITE_START_TRY
implementation should really try to get IO going. Ie. exactly what
I'm arguing for MS_ASYNC).

True. I believe our MS_ASYNC is technically within the standards.
I think it is suboptimal for sane users and against the spirit
of the spec.

I don't think so in general because userspace can't guarantee something

- IOW if the app or OS crashed here it would be possible to see 400-415 on
the disk and none of the previous transactions (assuming we don't know
the page size).
- If you are saying that the app does know the page size, then it is
obvious that it is by no stretch of the imagination hand optimising
IO, because it will have started 3 different IOs for the same page.
- Or (final option) only the first fadvise started IO, then any or all
of the subsequent transactions might not be synched after FADV_JUST_WAIT
(depending on what the DMA to disk saw).

I'm not convinced. You above example was bogus.
