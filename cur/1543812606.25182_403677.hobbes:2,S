Yes.  But it does sure stick out like a sore thumb in a patch or when
you try to use it.  Especially if you do something evil like require
user space to pass in a hash of the kernel code implementing the
interface.  So even the smallest changes of the implementation break
user space.

I don't know all of the answers.  But if we are going to document something
is half backed, let have the code behave like the interface is half backed
and at least try to keep it out of the hands of most applications.
To a large extent I agree that we should have fully backed interfaces in
the stable kernel.  Is that always possible?  How often do things not show
up until they are being used in the real world?  Is it possible to
find those things out in experimental branches?
