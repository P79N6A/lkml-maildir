No to the first question? to the second question? or to both? :-)
In kernel/futex.c does "PI" stand for Priority Inheritance?
e.g.
/*
  * Priority Inheritance state:
  */
struct futex_pi_state {
	/*
	 * list of 'owned' pi_state instances - these have to be
	 * cleaned up in do_exit() if the task exits prematurely:
	 */
	struct list_head list;
	/*
	 * The PI object:
	 */
	struct rt_mutex pi_mutex;
	struct task_struct *owner;
	atomic_t refcount;
	union futex_key key;
};
