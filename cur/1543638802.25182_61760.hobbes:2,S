You are correct; the same bug just got fixed in the 2.5 series.

Unfortunately its all controlled by the link ordering, and serial is
buried in within drivers/char.  Moving it before parport needs some
careful analysis and may very well end up breaking other stuff.
The simple answer for 2.4 may well be to move serial.c into
drivers/serial so it can be ordered into the right place on its own.
