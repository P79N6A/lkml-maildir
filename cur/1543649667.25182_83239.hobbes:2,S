You might also want to take a look at upx.  It's compressor
is roughly of the same quality as gzip, but it's decompresser
is only a couple of hundred bytes.  I don't know which will
buy you more in practice.  I smaller decompresser, or a larger
decompresser with that compresses a little smaller.  Or possibly
you just want to pass -9 to gzip?
