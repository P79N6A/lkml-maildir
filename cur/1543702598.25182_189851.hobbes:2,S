I know. The version of sisfb in 2.6 vanilla is from stone-age. This is 
has been fixed a long time ago in my current development version (and 
will be in 2.4 as soon as Marcelo applies my patch which I sent him 
about a week ago). For 2.6, using my current version requires James 
Simmons's fbdev-patch because of low-level fbdev-interface changes (like 
sysfs usage, etc).
The whole framebuffer stuff in 2.6 is ancient. (Look at the file dates.)
