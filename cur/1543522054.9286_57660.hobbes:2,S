SMP 2xPIII550 512MB memory, 2.2.14aa1-smp.
Running 24/7 _TWO_ setiathome _NOT_ nice
at the same time.
Best times, best kernel, unloaded machine,
mostly <510 minutes each seti,
very balanced among each other,
2.2.13 was <540 minutes, but ...
UP PII450 512MB memory at job, 2.2.7,
runnig 24/7, _ONE_ setiathome -nice 19:
mostly <480 minutes for each seti,
if machine unloaded (13 users possible).
After 7 days 2.2.14aa1-smp & seti non-stop.
Compliments to Andrea Arcangeli for the
SMP scheduler, the best actual solution.
