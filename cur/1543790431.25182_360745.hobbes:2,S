When I said to check the lenght I was thinking about
if (pnp_port_len(dev, 1) < 4) return -EINVAL;
According to infineon_tpm_register, the length is at least 4.
I whould also check that pnp_port_len(dev, 0) < 2.

if it failed, you don't need to release the region
a request_region (TPM_INF_ADDR, 2, "tpm_infineon0") could be usefull.
