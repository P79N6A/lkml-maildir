Yes, You have to use the SNAT/DNAT targets in the PREROUTING/POSTROUTING
chains of the NAT table. Recognize, that IP Masquerade is nothing else
than a subset of Network Adress Translation (NAT).

BTW: A collegue of mine has the problem, that a host has 4 NICs; 2 to
the LAN and 2 to the internet. Packets coming from LAN NIC 1 shall be
forwarded through WWW NIC 1 and Packets from LAN NIC 2 through WWW NIC
2. Is there any way to perform this on a 2.2.x kernel using ipchains?
And even whorse; They need destination NAT in the reverse manner of the
above.
