The HP NonStop Server (formerly called Tandem) has an MPP architecture
and a message passing OS (the NonStop Kernel). On this OS the TCP/IP
stack is implemented as a library against which the application
software is linked. The ethernet controllers/drivers maintain a
routing table for routing incoming traffic to the right process.
So the TCP/IP stack is implemented in userspace on the NonStop
Server, I would say.
