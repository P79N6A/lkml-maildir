Just like the last time you asked this question on linux-kernel, the
answer is in the Software RAID HOWTO, section 6.1, and it is still
available at
http://unthought.net/Software-RAID.HOWTO/Software-RAID.HOWTO-6.html#ss6.1
Nothing has changed  :)
If you feel that the answer there is inadequate, please let me know.
