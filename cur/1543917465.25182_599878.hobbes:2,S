This changes to KPRINT_SUBSYSTEM and KPRINT_DRIVER. The KPRINT_ prefix
is to clearly say that this is something related to logging. The
reason we can't use KBUILD_MODNAME is that this is defined on the
command line. The declaration inside the header would thus be horribly
wrong. We can, however, use KBUILD_MODNAME as a default value for
KPRINT_DRIVER, like:
static const char *KPRINT_DRIVER = KBUILD_MODNAME;
which would pre-process to something like:
static const char *KPRINT_DRIVER = "bcm43xx";
This value can still be overridden using #define KPRINT_DRIVER "new
name". In this case, it is possible that the original KPRINT_DRIVER
symbol can cause an "unused variable"-warning. I guess this is fixable
with the gcc "unused" variable attribute.
