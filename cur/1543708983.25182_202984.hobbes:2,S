OK, I applied patch01 first - same problems.  Then I applied patch02 
_over_ patch01.  Still same results.
I am not sure if you meant me to apply over the first debug patch you 
sent?  Here, I just applied to standard 2.6.3 > 8139too.c file with 
RTL8139_NDEBUG 1 set.
With these patched dmesg gets flooded - and I have real trouble 
trying to do anything on the box with the timeout issues.
