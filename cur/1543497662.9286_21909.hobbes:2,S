Yes, if we're talking about about difficulties at boot time, and how the
everyday use of something differs from the boot time use of it, then the
argument for including Plug & Play in the kernel just got very strong.
As ugly as Plug & Play is, it certainly does work better when all of PNP
is in the kernel. The existing support, which boils down to half a dozen
drivers having slightly smarter detection routines, is nuts.
And sure, you can put isapnptools on an initrd, and tool about trying to
coax life out of your cards (heavens help a newbie doing this), but then
you've just justified leaving pcmcia-cs in user space too.
