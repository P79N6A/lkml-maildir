Not necessarily as simple as that -- you need to make sure you don't 
pass something bogus to a sysfs_remove_blah() function at 
unregister/unload time, if sysfs_create_blah() failed.
Certainly sysfs_foo() failure is often ignorable in the sense that you 
want the driver to keep loading... but that does not imply that it is 
strictly ignorable, if you also consider the associated cleanup code.
