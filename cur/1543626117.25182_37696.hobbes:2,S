Specifically, i get the error message:
"all of your loopback devices are in use"
I have the follow kernel options enabled, using Redhat's kernel
config as a guide:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=m
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_NBD=m
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE=4096
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y
Thanks for the help.
