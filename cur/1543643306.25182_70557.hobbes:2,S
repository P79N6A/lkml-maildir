Don't base it on gid. Remember, a user can be a member of multiple
gids for file access. At this point you may get a payroll/production
conflict, or a production/production background conflict.
You really have to use a resource accounting structure that allows
one and only one id per process. A user may (like groups) have
access to multiple resource accounts, but a given process should
only have one.
