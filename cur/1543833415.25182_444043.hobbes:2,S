Of course it is possible that someone uses AIO on hypfs files, but
normally the synchronous IO functions are used. I used the AIO
implementation together with do_sync_read/write() only because
it was not more effort regarding the implementation and we got
the AIO interface for free.
Nevertheless we probably should implement the complete
function.
