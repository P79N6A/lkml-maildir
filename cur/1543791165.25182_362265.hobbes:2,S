That generic mechanism is the kernel virtual remapping.  However, it has
a runtime performance cost, which is increased TLB footprint inside the
kernel, and a more costly implementation of __pa() and __va().
I'll admit, I'm biased toward partial solutions without runtime cost
before we start incurring constant cost across the entire kernel,
especially when those partial solutions have other potential in-kernel
users.
