The binary mount format is frozen forever, so the changes to nfs_mount.h
and nfs4_mount.h are definitely NACKed.
Otherwise, it would be nice to know why this absolutely has to be made a
mount option rather than just having a system-wide option (either a
module/boot parameter or a sysctl) to control the behaviour of all
mounts.
