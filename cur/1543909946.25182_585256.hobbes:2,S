Actually, you are the one who have to
come up with a better method. :-)
You implement it, you deploy on your server,
you work out the quirks,
you win the discussion and impress everybody.

Feel free to be persistent and do the work & testing
needed.  People have done so before, which is why
there are so many linux filesystems to choose from.
What you can't do though, is to start with an attitude
that "anything can be done" and then expect to change
the direction of kernel work before everything is
figured out.  Experimental stuff stays in your private
tree till it is proven - for a reason.

That name translation layer has a nasty failure mode.
Let's say I want to move all files in /usr/local/* into /usr/old-local/
The name translation layer makes the transition seem
instant, even though there are now 10 million files queued
for renaming. References to /usr/local now goes to
/usr/old-local/ thanks to translation.
Now the problem.  I did the move in order to fill
/usr/local/ with new improved files. But all references
to /usr/local now goes to /usr/old-local/, so the new
files go there as well.
A translation layer _can_ work around this, by noting
that /usr/local is currently being translated, the
move queue has not finished processing, so further accesses
to /usr/local goes to /usr/local-tmp/ instead, to be moved
into /usr/local when that other batch of moves finishes.
In doing this, you set yourself up for lots of complexity
and lots of behind-the-scenes work. People will
wonder why the server is so busy when nobody is
doing much, and what if there is a power crash
or disk error on a busy server. It'd be an "interesting"
fsck job on a machine that went down while
processing several such deferred moves and translations. :-/

Sure - you don't have to prove that it will work now.
Working it out over time and then showing us is ok.
