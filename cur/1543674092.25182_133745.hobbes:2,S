Hi!
I have an usb keyboard, and it has some extra keys (internet keys, 
multimedia keys).
If I use the keyboard in ps/2 port, all of those extra buttons work, 
because I can bind the extra keys's keycodes in a hotkeys program.
If I use the keyboard in the usb port, some of the extra keys don't 
work. In plain console, if I push some of the "non-working" extra 
buttons, I get these error messages:
   keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 259
   keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 259
The problem is, that I can not bind keycode 259 in X, because it only 
works for keycodes between 8 - 255. But when I use the keyboard in the 
usb port, I get too high keycodes like (see above) 259, which I can not use.
I (fortunately) have a few working internet buttons. If I press those in 
plain console, I get these messages:
   keyboard: unknown scancode e0 66
I don't think this is an error, because that key, which "produces" the 
"keyboard: unknown scancode e0 66" message, works under X, and can be 
binded to an action.
Is there any chance to make the keyboard work similarly in the ps/2 and 
the usb port?
Please try to help me with this problem, I'm already through the 
xfree86-list, and the debian-user list, but nobody could help me.
Thanks!
