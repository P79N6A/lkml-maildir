So we now have an exciting "well kexec might work but here is a new
random weirdness to screw people who it hit".

I take it this was how you came to find every cable related bug while
trying to work out what was going on ?

No the IDE layer does DMA changedown fine, well apart from all the
error/timer races in the old IDE code.

All of which are before you fixed the drive side stuff

And the third is LinuxBIOS so you've actually not fixed anything for that
one.

Yep.

It certainly seems to be Nvidia specific, so perhaps Nvidia can provide
more details on the Nforce4 cable detection ? As with a lot of Nvidia
stuff there was much reverse engineering involved in the original code
base.
And if its a specific board or couple of boards then we should perhaps
use DMI to match them specifically.

If it still goes I've got a rather iffy NF3 but not an NF4 handy.
