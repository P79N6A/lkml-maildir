console.c line 2491 (function con_init:)
	init_timer(&console_timer);
	console_timer.function = blank_screen;
	if (blankinterval) {
		mod_timer(&console_timer, jiffies + blankinterval);
	}
So the trick appears to be to not initialize console_timer.  Then, on line 
1283 (function setterm_command:)
	case 9: /* set blanking interval */
		blankinterval = ((par[1] < 60) ? par[1] : 60) * 60 * HZ;
  		poke_blanked_console();
		break;
Do some "magic" to initialize console_timer if it is not.
I think blanking by default is bad. Many times it bite me in the past. Same 
old history: only monitor, no keyboard, couldn't see what's going on until I 
plugged a keyboard (which of course, was in another room.)
BTW:

*IF* Linux primary target is the server market then, what kind of optimization 
in console blanking if you need to hack your init script and insert "setterm 
-blank 0" somewhere??
