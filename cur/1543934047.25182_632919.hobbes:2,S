Why not?  The debugging files won't be created, true, but the driver
should work just fine regardless.  This is exactly the way uhci-hcd
behaves, and it hasn't caused any problems.

No.  That is the mistake you made before.  If debugfs isn't enabled 
then the driver should just ignore things, yes -- and in particular it 
should ignore the fact that the return code is ERR_PTR(-ENODEV).  No 
extra checking is required.

If NULL is returned, it's a real error, agreed.  But if anything else
is returned then the call was successful as far as the driver is 
concerned.

Greg, it sounds like you have forgotten the rationale you originally 
used for specifying the return codes in debugfs!  The idea was to 
return non-NULL if CONFIG_DEBUGFS was disabled, so that drivers could 
pretend the calls had succeeded and not need to worry about matters 
beyond their control.
Only a NULL return indicates a genuine error.  The kerneldoc for 
debugfs_create_dir says this very plainly.

Most distributions enable CONFIG_DEBUGFS by default, don't they?  So 
this problem only comes up when people make up their own configs.  
Having USB_DEBUG enabled and DEBUGFS disabled seems like a perfectly 
reasonable combination to me.  I wouldn't change any aspect of the 
configuration logic.
