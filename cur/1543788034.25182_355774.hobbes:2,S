Hi everybody.
Please CC me only any reply to this message, as I am
not a mailing list subscriber.
This was my last resort, as all searches on the
subject topic yield messages from 2004, many of which
mention Jeff Garzik's name.
After trying 2.6.13.2, I still don't get the PATA
drives recognized, so I believe it's still not there
yet.
The question is, will it ever be, or has it been
dropped?
Thank you very much.
Best regards.
