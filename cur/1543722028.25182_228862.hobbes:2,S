First off ... Why just say the internal SRAM pool? I think it woudl be better 
to say that the devices can only access their own address space, and can only 
DMA from a subset of that (which may be the full original set, QED)
Second... Remember that the SOC can also be the CPU! At least on XScale, there 
are some portions that we can DMA from main memory (I think USB is one).
Of course this might not be at all relevant to the discussion, and of course I 
could be using my rectally-based knowledge, but I _THINK_ that this is 
correct.
