   I've look at your script and it kinda flew over my head.
   Would you mind explain this a bit?
We generate the offsets as data items in an assembler file, then we
parse out those data section entries and spit them into the header.
It allows cross compilation setups to work, ie. even in cases when you
cannot generate and run a binary.
Franks a lot,
