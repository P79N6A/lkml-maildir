I had this problem on two thinkpads connected over ethernet via pcmcia cards.
no dhcp, no masquearding, one has redhat 6, the other redhat 5.2 upgraded, 
the first one 2.2.12, the other one 2.2.9. 
The 1000ms delay in ping usually went away after starting some heavy network
usage (like starting an ssh connection). It never showed up when the card
was initialized by the system itself (once pcmcia was installed correctly),
only when using a manual ifconfig (after inserting the card).
It never lasted longer than about 30 seconds.
