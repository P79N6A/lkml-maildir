VMIN was basically invented for communication protocols when you know
the block length that should arrive within a given timeout. Its pretty
much essential on old old boxes and was very important for
interrupt/context switch reduction when doing block transfers. In that
world the read blocks or in O_NDELAY returns -EAGAIN (0 in old SYS5)
until the data block is big enough to warrant its copying. Similarly
poll has no business saying data is ready until a large enough block is.
When talking to a human setting VMIN > 1 makes no sense anyway. In fact
nowdays it makes even less sense than it did before because of the use
of UTF8 encodings for unicode characters.
