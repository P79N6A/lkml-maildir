libertas: remove a coverity bug
... by removing an ill-conceived, useless line.

Dunno how this line made it into the patch that I made in
February and was commited in May. At that time, I didn't hardly
knew anything about skb's at all and certainly didn't play with
raw ethernet types. Maybe it was a remnant of some bugus test
that I or the committer did?!?
I tested the driver after the removal of this line with ping and
ssh, but not anything else (e.g. no mesh, no tshark monitoring).
