Hey, seeing the intensity of your complaints about _not_ being Cc'd...
Better safe than serial maintainer ;-)
	OK, so what stuff do you want to be Cc'd on?  My current approximation
would be arch/arm/*, include/asm-arm/*,drivers/serial/*,include/linux/serial*.
Well, and any changes of tty interfaces, if I ever get involved in such...
Any additions/removals?
