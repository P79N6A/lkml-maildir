hi,
i had some compiler errors when playing with the linux trace toolkit
(ltt) and tracked them down:
there is no prevention against multiple #includes in
include/asm-ppc/time.h.
and include/asm-ppc/smplock.h doesn't seem to be safe, too.
i tried kernel 2.4.13.
please add the #ifndef _filename_ \ #define _filename_ \ #endif stuff.
regards,
alex
