Yeap, definitely a bug in the kernel and we're trying to fix it.  Just
for the record, we have _always_ issued FLUSH CACHE, so there hasn't
been and won't be any data loss problem.  The data loss problem was
mentioned as why we can't do things completely inside kernel without
updating userland shutdown(8) which issues STANDBYNOW.
