I've been running 2.4.17 + O(1) patch for a while on a pretty
heavily loaded server (dual CPU) and it works like a charm.
I've put 2.4.19+O(1) on the test machine, it seems to behave OK.
2.4.1[7,9] have Andrea's VM BTW.
I think I still have the sources of the 2.4.17 O(1) patch...
somewhere, if you want to try, just email me.
Cheers,
