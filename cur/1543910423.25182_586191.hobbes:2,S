I'm concerned about the worst case scenarios, and those don't change.
The proposed changes can be seen as an optimisation of various things,
but they do not change the fundamental issues.

Sure, and on that note I don't object to them, they might be quite
useful at times. It just doesn't help the worst case scenarios.

Right, and I guess I have to go at it again, this time ensuring not to
touch the fast-path nor sacrificing anything NUMA for simplicity in the
reclaim path.
(I think its a good thing to be technically deadlock free - and if your
work on the fault path rewrite and buffered write rework shows anything
it is that you seem to agree with this)

Non of the people who have actually used these patches seem to object to
the dropping packets thing. Nor do I see that as a real problem,
networks are assumed lossy - also if you really need that traffic for a
RT app that also runs on the machine you need networked swap on (odd
combination but hey, it should be possible) then I can make that work as
well with a little bit more effort.
Also, I'm a very reluctant to accept a known deadlock, esp. since the
changes needed are not _that_ complex.

They really do rely on some VM interaction too, network does not have
enough information to break out of the deadlock on its own.
As for how its going, it seems to work quite reliably in my test setup -
that is, I can shut down the NFS server, swamp the client in network
traffic for hours (yes it will quickly stop userspace) and then restart
the NFS server and the client will reconnect and resume operation.
There are also a few people running various versions of my patches in
production environments. One university is running it on a 500-node
cluster and another on ~500 thin-clients and there is someone using it
in a blade product.

Yes (we - not I personally) want networked swap. There is quite the
demand for it in the marked. It allows clusters and blades to be build
without any storage - which not only saves on the initial cost of a hard
drive [1] but also on maintenance but more importantly on energy cost
and heat production.
[1] a single drive is not that expensive, but when you're talking about
a 1000 node cluster things tend to add up.

were we much bothered by the buffered write deadlock? - why accept a
known deadlock if a solid solution is quite attainable?
