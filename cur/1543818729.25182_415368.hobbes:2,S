If vrf has no other uses besides your proprietary application, I'd shudder.

I don't know an answer (not even a rough one), since there is AFAICS one 
example of what you describe: the CiscoVPN kernel module. The source is 
available (so you have a chance to run it on any kernel you like), but it's 
got a typical EULA. No sign of GPL.
