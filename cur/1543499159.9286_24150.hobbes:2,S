Hi,
Apparently I was confusing, because people are (apparently) disagreeing with
what I wrote but agreeing with what I meant to say.  Essentially, all I said
was that the choice of logical volume management by label or UUID has no
effect on the desirability of devfs (except that devfs may make
implementation a little easier).  And that the magic word "policy" that's
being thrown around as a reason not to like devfs just doesn't apply.
(After all, what can be more mechanism than "the disk obtained at LUN 0 on
ID 2 on the second SCSI controller?)  Hope this clarifies a bit.

Yes, I know -- I was over-simplifying wrt device names, because it wasn't
relevant.  I definitely wasn't saying a thing about the specific choice of
device names themselves made by devfs (although if you ask, I think the
devfs naming scheme makes tons more sense).

That was essentially my point.  Except that I wasn't thinking about
specifically a scheme of using devfsd to manage volumes; I was looking more
at looking up the UUID or label from all available disks as it is needed.

Yes, I realize that; and just after I sent this mail I realized that this is
unnecessary given a persistence scheme for devfs.  The only problem I hoped
to solve was the need to create sockets for init, which sometimes need to be
created before init actually starts.  So forget I said that; just a random
thought.

Ack!  Sorry, I didn't realize that was happening; should be fixed now.
