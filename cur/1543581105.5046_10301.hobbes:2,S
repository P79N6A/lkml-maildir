Adaptec 2940, although it appears to have been spontainous PCI bus death.
I've never seen a system die like that, so I took a while to rule out
hardware.  CPU didn't overheat, memory didn't go bad, no drives
failed...  even checked the PCI sockets for bad seating.  Nada.  Just...
the motherboard itself died, and only when doing a lot of SCSI I/O.
Rather unusal, it'd been running for a year now without a glitch until
I installed 2.4.  One of those stupid conincidences.
Sorry for the wasted cycles.
