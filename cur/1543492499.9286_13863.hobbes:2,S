At the start we have this route:
ccssu:~# route -n | grep 202
195.5.61.202    62.244.13.19    255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0        0 eth0
ccssu:~# traceroute -n 195.5.61.202
traceroute to 195.5.61.202 (195.5.61.202), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
 1  62.244.13.19  1.105 ms  0.886 ms  1.028 ms
And all work as expected, packets go to 62.244.13.19.
then dialin PPP connection appears, with remote addres being 195.5.61.202
new route added and rouuting table is now:
ccssu:~# route -n | grep 202
195.5.61.202    62.244.13.19    255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0        0 eth0
195.5.61.202    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 ppp1
But hey! Look at this traceroute:
ccssu:~# traceroute -n 195.5.61.202
traceroute to 195.5.61.202 (195.5.61.202), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
 1  62.244.13.19  1.064 ms  0.862 ms  1.01 ms
It still sending packets to 62.244.13.19!
Now we deleting offending route: 
ccssu:~# route del -host 195.5.61.202 gw 62.244.13.19
and all is fine:
ccssu:~# !tr
traceroute -n 195.5.61.202
traceroute to 195.5.61.202 (195.5.61.202), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
 1  195.5.61.202  1106.32 ms  889.851 ms  909.895 ms
that is ppp device (if it helps)
ccssu:~# ifconfig ppp1
ppp1      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol
          inet addr:195.5.61.20  P-t-P:195.5.61.202  Mask:255.255.255.255
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:61 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:61 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:10
I am pretty sure that sometimes I can add second route and it still will
redirect packet a of previous one
(like route add -host 195.5.61.202 gw 195.5.61.19 ; route add -host 195.5.61.202 gw 195.5.61.129
will send packets to 195.5.61.19)
Before today I was sure it is always the case but after todays reboot
I can reproduce 100% only the PPP case.
Is PPP so special?
Bye,
    Oleg
