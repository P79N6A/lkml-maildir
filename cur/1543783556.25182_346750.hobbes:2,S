Well, take a look at the double acks for 84439343, 84440447 and 84441059, 
they seem pretty much identical to me.

The numbers I mentioned are straight from the tcpdump and are not scaled, 
so they need to be multiplied by 4. But even 9420, combined with a RTT of 
20ms, results in a total usable bandwidth of about 3.75 Mbps, not enough 
for this real-time stream at peak times.
Besides, it often gets even worse than 2355, all it takes is a few 
application slowdowns.

That makes perfect sense...
I'll test it out on Tuesday, when I can connect again to the real-time 
streams that we use.
Thanks a lot!
