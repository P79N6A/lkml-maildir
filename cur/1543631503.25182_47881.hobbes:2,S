Hi there,
again this question to the 2.2. Kernel tree, why this kernels does not have 
the new DRM Engine? Its out since January 2002.
Another issue i've noticed is, if you want to load a drm module, you have to 
load agpgart.o before, otherwise it won't load and even won't work. But if 
you have a PCI Card, agpgart is superflous and will not load, so the DRM 
Module cannot be loaded too.
This works fine with 2.4 Kernel tree, but not with 2.2 Kernel tree. Actually 
tested 2.2.21.
insmod: /lib/modules/2.2.21/misc/r128.o: insmod r128 failed
[drm:r128_init] *ERROR* Cannot initialize agpgart module.
Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 203M
agpgart: Detected an Intel i810 E, but could not find the secondary device.
agpgart: no supported devices found.
/lib/modules/2.2.21/misc/agpgart.o: init_module: Device or resource busy
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters, including 
invalid IO or IRQ parameters
/lib/modules/2.2.21/misc/agpgart.o: insmod agpgart failed
So, fully useless for PCI Cards.
Kind regards,
	Marc
