this is the -rt kernel, with PREEMPT_RT enabled, so SA_INTERRUPT should 
make no difference. All interrupts are executed by their interrupt 
thread, and are fully preemptible:
fastcall int handle_IRQ_event(unsigned int irq, struct pt_regs *regs,
                                struct irqaction *action)
{
        int ret, retval = 0, status = 0;
        /*
         * Unconditionally enable interrupts for threaded
         * IRQ handlers:
         */
        if (!hardirq_count() || !(action->flags & SA_INTERRUPT))
                local_irq_enable();
i.e. SA_INTERRUPT should have no effect.
