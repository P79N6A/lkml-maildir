Thanks for reporting this.
Can the app use MAP_SHARED? Or PROT_READ and copy the mapped page to
its own private one before modifying it?
It is likely to only be very specific userspace drivers and stuff
that would ever do this... but if they become a real problem then
Hugh's patch would be able to solve it. Though I'd like to try to
avoid relying on that if possible.
Perhaps the nice thing to do would be to include Hugh's patch *and*
display the warning message, and remove the functionality in a
later release.
