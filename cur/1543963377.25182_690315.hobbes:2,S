Is there anything in your dmesg?
static int walk_pmd_range(pud_t *pud, unsigned long addr, unsigned long end,
                          const struct mm_walk *walk, void *private)
{
        pmd_t *pmd;
        unsigned long next;
        int err = 0;
        pmd = pmd_offset(pud, addr);
        do {
                next = pmd_addr_end(addr, end);
                if (pmd_none_or_clear_bad(pmd)) {
                        if (walk->pte_hole)
                                err = walk->pte_hole(addr, next, private);
                        if (err)
                                break;
                        continue;
There was a discussion on LKML in the last couple of days about
pmd_bad() triggering on huge pages.  Perhaps we're clearing the mapping
with the pmd_none_or_clear_bad(), and *THAT* is leaking the page.
