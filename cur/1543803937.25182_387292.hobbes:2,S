Subject: [PATCH 0/9] UML various fixes for 2.6.16
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Merge various fixes, mainly for locking issues.
A bit of attention is to give to "uml: avoid malloc to sleep in atomic
sections". It's really an hack, but we already use this hack in a more buggy
way (see the patch).
In practice, when malloc() is called, it's translated in
a call to kmalloc(GFP_?), where ATOMIC or KERNEL is used depending on
in_atomic() and in_interrupt().
