sure:
--------------{ x86.git instructions }---------->
 git-clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git linux-2.6.git
 cd linux-2.6.git
 git-branch x86
 git-checkout x86
 git-pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git mm
 git-log HEAD@{1}.. # see what's in #mm
(do subsequent pulls via "git-pull --force", as we frequently rebase the
git tree. NOTE: this might override your own local changes, so do this
only if you dont mind about losing thse changes in that tree.)
