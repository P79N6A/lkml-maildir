Good, ... except that it doesn't work. AFAIK, POSIX mandates inodes
to be unique until umount, not until inode cache expires :-)
IOW, if you have such implementation of st_ino, you can emulate samefile()
with it, but you cannot have it without violating POSIX.

Not on terabyte scale disk arrays, which are getting quite common these days.

They currently do that usually by not supporting more than 4G files
in a single FS.
				Have a nice fortnight
