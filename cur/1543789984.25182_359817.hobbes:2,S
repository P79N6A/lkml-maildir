Excellent.  Looks like we actually caught something.  Pity we don't have
a stack trace which means that there might be more bugs.
Anyway, here are three patches which should fix this.  This should go
into 2.6.14.
Arnaldo, you can pull them from
master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/herbert/net-2.6.git
Cheers,
