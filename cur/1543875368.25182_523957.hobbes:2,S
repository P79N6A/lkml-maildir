It's better, but still skewed.  Try two chew.c's; they account 80% each.

That's great and much needed, but this is still probed; so what's wrong with 
doing it in-lined?

Higher scheduling accuracy may actually offset any overhead incurred, so it's 
well worth it; and if it's in-lined it should mean even less overhead.

If sched_clock() goes backwards, why not fix it, instead of hacking around 
it?
Thanks!
