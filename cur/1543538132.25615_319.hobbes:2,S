I guess this is known and being worked on, but my workstation running
2.2.17pre7 just became unusable (had to hit the reset button).  I found
the following in the kernel messages log.  The system was pingable, ssh
was still listening for connections, but couldn't seem to fork.  Keyboard
was totally dead (capslock/numlock didn't affect leds, couldn't switch
VCs).

I left for lunch shortly before 13:30.
