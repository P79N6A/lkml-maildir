Subject: [PATCH] (0/4) stack updates for x86

The kernel currently uses an 8k stack, per task.  Here is the 
infrastructure needed to allow us to halve that.  The original work 
was by Ben LaHaise.  I broke it out into several patches and updated 
it for the current kernels.
A-thread_info_cleanup-2.5.50+bk-5.patch
	Gets asm-i386/thread_info.h ready for the irqstack and
	overflow detection patches
B-interrupt_stacks-2.5.50+bk-5.patch
	Have special stacks for use in interrupts.
C-stack_usage_check-2.5.50+bk-5.patch
	Check for stack overflows on entry to each funtion.  Use gcc's
	-p profiling feature to do it.
D-4k-stack-2.5.50+bk-5.patch
	make a config option to turn on 4k stacks.  (there appears to
	be a problem with this right now).
