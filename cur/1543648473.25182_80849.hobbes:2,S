There was no such change just a discussion of what the kernel
has been doing since 2.5.8 or so.

There is a bug in device_suspend.  device_shutdown, and device_suspend
where merged and the POWER_DOWN case now removes the drivers which
is a bug.  You may be getting hit with that.
Eric Blade has posed a patch fixing that.
Or else there is a change in the ->remove() method of one your drivers.

Someone implemented that in the IDE driver deliberately.  I haven't
a clue why but it happened.
