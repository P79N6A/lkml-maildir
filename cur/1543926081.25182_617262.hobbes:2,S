This hook is going to be used by the dynamic page table patch for s390:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=119333667710539&w=2
That patch allows processes to have different number of page table
levels, 31 bit processes have 2 levels (2GB), normal 64 bit processes
have 3 levels (4TB) and really big 64 bit processes can have 4 levels
(8PB). The downgrade of a page table to use less levels than the parent
process is done in arch_pick_mmap_layout. The upgrade is done by using
the arch_rebalance_pgtables call. I've considered using the
arch_get_unmapped_area but got scared by the indirection in
get_unmapped_area:
        get_area = current->mm->get_unmapped_area;
        if (file && file->f_op && file->f_op->get_unmapped_area)
                get_area = file->f_op->get_unmapped_area;
        addr = get_area(file, addr, len, pgoff, flags);
