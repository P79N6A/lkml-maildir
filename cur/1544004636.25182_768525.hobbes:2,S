Your understanding is correct. The overhead of round_jiffies() is not
large, though.
I want to get rid of this in blk_delete_timer():
        if (list_empty(&q->timeout_list))
                del_timer(&q->timeout);
though and simply let the timer run even if the list is empty, since for
sync sequential IO we'll be fiddling a much with the timer as we did
before unifying it. And then the timer will expire every x seconds
always and it becomes more important with the grouping.
