hmm... this was with:
$ arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc --version
arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc (CodeSourcery Sourcery G++ Lite 2007q1-21)
4.2.0 20070413 (prerelease)
...and also with:
$ arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc --version
arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc (Sourcery G++ Lite 2008q3-72) 4.3.2

I think the header file is the proper place for this... the Kconfig
trickery ends up being just another way to say !CONFIG_MX3_IPU_IRQS.
