Right - to some degree.  I'm sure many problems can be dealt with, but
it takes a lot of time to sort out the details.  For streaming
performance, I guess in most cases you will get the same performance
because you won't find a single duplicate block in those files.  Two
competing readers should be a much bigger problem.
Still, there are more problems, no doubt.

s/kernel/kernel source/
If it was just the images, I couldn't care less.  But 15x 200-300 Megs
does hurt a bit. :)
grep -r over multiple trees hurts even more, when RAM spills over.
