Incorrect.  When the user specifies blocking on the file descriptor
we must give it what it asked for.  -EAGAIN on a blocking file descriptor
is always a bug, in all situations, that's what this code used to do and we
fixed it because it's a bug.
It goes "merrily on its way" if it marks the file descriptor as non-blocking.
