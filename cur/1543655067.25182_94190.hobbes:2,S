Well it wont protect you from tampering, there isnt really a way to do
that

Kernel module code lives outside that. You also have to make sure you 
check the exception handlers area as part of your text.

You need to stop a process to do the check. You also need to audit its
mappings, check any trampolines on the stack, check any data which is
used for things like syscall numbering etc. Since there are function
pointers all over the place in the data segment it wont help you one
iota against tampering by competent bodies.

That may be easier since you can then lock the mm, walk and verify it,
then unlock the mm.

You need to be very careful or you may make your box less not more
secure. In addition you have to handle shared memory and memory mapped
i/o mmap spaces, which is another reason you have to lock all users of
that mm or stop them.
