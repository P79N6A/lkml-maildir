A comment is definitely required: you must say *why* you are aligning
the structure (a clearer comment would be better, of course):
	/* We return a pointer after the structure to the unwitting
	   caller: ensure safe alignment. */
The alignment of a structure member of type X is the alignment of type
X: this seems obvious to me.  And "type X data[0];" is the standard
way of representing a variable struct.
