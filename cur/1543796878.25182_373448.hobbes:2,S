Could you provide a little detail on the technology by which a distro 
checks for functionality against a kernel which wasn't necessarily 
released when the distro shipped. My udev doesn't generate /dev/timewarp.
Going to a new kernel in the same series shouldn't have to be treated as 
if it were a change to a whole new operating system, and shouldn't 
require completely replacing existing utilities with new ones which 
aren't backware compatible to allow fallback to the original kernel.
