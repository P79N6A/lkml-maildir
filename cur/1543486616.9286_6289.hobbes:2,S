+  If you say Y here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
+  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
Err, that should definitely be "If you say N here...".
+  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
+  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
+  will run faster if you say Y here.
