I had exactly this problem with the Maxtor 61 GB drive on my 
Pentium based server.  Theoretically a BIOS upgrade could fix it,
but ASUS quit making BIOS upgrades for my motherboard two years
ago.
I solved the problem by getting a Promise Ultra 100 controller
and putting the drive on that. Works perfectly under Linux 
Mandrake 2.2.17-mdk-21 - it shows up as /dev/hde.  They are
cheap controllers if you don't get the RAID version.
Best wishes.
