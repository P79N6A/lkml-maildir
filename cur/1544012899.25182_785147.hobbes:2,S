Hi MinChan,
Thank you for your interest in sched_mc power saving feature.  As
Balbir has mentioned, you will need a power measurement infrastructure
like an external power meter.
Laptops have battery discharge rate measurement that is a good
approximation for power consumption.  But that is not helpful to test
sched_mc since we would need a multi-socket multi core system to get
power saving benefit from the enhancements.
The 'package idle' information comes from /proc/stat by adding up the
idle times from various logical CPUs belonging to a single physical
package.  All logical CPUs belonging to a single physical package can
be identified from /proc/cpuinfo or
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<n>/topology/physical_package_id
