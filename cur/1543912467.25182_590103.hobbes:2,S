Well -- the world where ATA, SCSI, USB, Firewire and what have you are 
low-level drivers to a unifying storage layer is under non too obscure 
definitions sort of not non-wonderful...
Admittedly, the unifying layer is a little SCSI inspired but so is a lot of 
the hardware. As long as the users (the humans) resist SCSI inspiration, it 
should be safe.
