 The only reasonable option, there seems to be 0x4 reset code which means
"execute int 0x19".  Unfortunately, when using this code BIOSes do not
reset interrupt vectors and other stuff needed to boot-up so it would not
work. 
 Other options are either not defined precisely or need data from RAM,
which might already be trashed.  In the latter case it's better to halt or
reboot than to try to recover.
 In fact what we really need is a code that means "initialize all hardware
but leave memory intact".  PC BIOSes haven't got such an option.
