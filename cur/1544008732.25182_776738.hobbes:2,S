OK, I will update accordingly.

Ah yes, the prototypes were removed, but not the comment.  I will remove this.

  I don't believe it can be dropped entirely -- although the
controller only has a single channel, it does support two drives on
that channel.  Unless I understand incorrectly, I will make the
"drive->dn & 1" change.

I will remove it, and the associated spin_unlock_irqrestore.

I will change.  Although, the change to the pulse width of DIOR/DIOW
doesn't seem that difficult to make.  Maybe I should just go ahead and
do that.

I will update the comment to reflect reality, unless I implement the FIXME.

Hmmm, that's right, that is what the code is doing.  I will update the

The specs I have indicate that it is not the same.  For example, bits
13:12 in the IDETIM register at offset 0x40-0x41 of the PIIX give the
IORDY Sample Point, but the same function is found in bits 19-17 in
the SLVT register at offset 0x44-0x47 in the IT8172.  Perhaps better
comments are in order, or perhaps these bitfields should be defined in
a .h file?

OK, I will update accordingly.  Am I correct that prefetch should be
enabled if "drive->media == ide_disk", and not otherwise?
I am not sure how to determine if IORDY sampling is supported by a
drive.  If I'm reading the code correctly, other drivers only check
that the PIO mode is > 2 (not > 1 as in my driver) -- that seems to be
the case for at least piix.c, siimage.c, and it8213.c.

Do you think I should keep this code in here?  It kind of seems silly
to run drivers at UDMA0 speeds just because of a few bad drives back
in 2000 when the driver was originally written.  Should this not be
handled in userspace by hdparm?  Other drivers don't seem to do
something similar.

Unless it is decided to eliminate the slower-cycle-time feature (in
which case this comment would go away), I will update the comment
accordingly as per your clarified email.

Yes, as you said in the follow-on email, this is being set to UDMA
mode 0 regardless of the mode selected, due to the preceeding
slower-cycle-time comment.  I will await your response before changing
this.

OK, I will only execute this code if it's a non-UDMA mode.

I'm not quite sure what you mean.  I'll implement something and get
your feedback.

Well, mine is clearly wrong.  Am I correct that {0x41, 0x80, 0x80} is
checking that the IDE Decode Enable bit is set?  This bit is in the
same location in both the PIIX and the IT8172.

I will update accordingly.

I will clean up the parens and remove the first check.
