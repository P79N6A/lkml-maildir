When trying to compile kernel 2.2.0-pre2 I am getting the following
error:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.2.0pre2/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -D__SMP__ -pipe
-fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2
-malign-functions=2 -DCPU=686   -c -o ewrk3.o ewrk3.c
ewrk3.c: In function `EISA_signature':
ewrk3.c:1658: fixed or forbidden register was spilled.
This may be due to a compiler bug or to impossible asm
statements or clauses.
According to the documentation in Changes the libraries are on the
appropriate level. Compiler is egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3 release) 
from the slackware 3.6. There's still the problem with the egcs which was
mentioned in the Changes docu? Never ran into a problem with previous
kernel compilations. 
Any hints where to look for fixing the problem?
Thanks,
-Eva.
