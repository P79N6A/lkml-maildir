I would argue that their is something marjorly funny with the synaptics
touchpads themselves (in some scenareos at least). I have seen this
*exact* behaviour not only on linux (2.4, mandrake) but in Win98 and
Win2k. This was a Dell Inspiron 4000 which my gf of the time had. She's
had the warranty guys out several times to try and fix it, and atm it's
not happenning. I do remember something about the Dell guy saying it's a
known problem though...
There were also some strange things I had to do due to the way the machine
dealt with internal&external mice...
Just keep in mind it could be hardware related too. Yes, unpredictable and
all that, but I've seen the same thing on windows, which has been fixed
(albeit temporarily) by replacing the touchpad.
I haven't had time to try and code up a hack to fix it, sorry.
