	Needless to say, I'm not particularly amused when I get emails
of this nature either.  This is just a recommendation, you get it from
all the vendors, and I've had solaris machines running for hundreds of
days before.  
	So, every time someone freaks out and starts advocating linux
for everything in sight, it really gives us a bad name in general.  Just
because you run it doesn't mean they're going to, and there are a lot of
things that solaris does better than linux (and some things that linux
does better than solaris) -- they make their choices for their reasons,
and shouting "Linux!" at everything won't make it so.
