Internet mailing lists are one such thing where anyone
can write anything they want and sound smart.  Like
the statement above.
Did you talk to "everyone else"?  Or is this just you,
James B and Christoph?
How do you know everyone else's opinion?
Maybe because you're telling them what they should think?

No.  This isn't currently the case.  You're maybe making it now
to be like this, but it is currently not the case.

"should", "will".
The question is then: Where were you Jeff all this time?
Why did the SAS code had to be posted for SCSI Core to see how many
things it needs to repair.
I've been pointing those things out since, oh well, for many years
now.

If SCSI Core had seen the necessary over the years changes,
it wouldn't be in this situation now.

USB/SAS/SBP:
HW -> LLDD -> Transport Layer -> SCSI Core
MPT:
HW -> Transport Layer (FW) -> LLDD -> SCSI Core.
