The microcode driver handles the case of different types of CPUs in an SMP 
system internally. Namely, it selects the appropriate microcode data 
chunks for each CPU and then uploads them correctly to each one. Anyway, 
it only works for Intel processors, so AMD is not in the equation anyway 
(unless I discover that AMD processors support similar feature and enhance 
the driver to support it).
Kind regards
