Subject: [RFC][PATCH] x86_64:  Fix collision between pmtimer and pit/hpet timekeeping
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
	I thought I had caught all the problems when the no-legacy HPET support
landed close to the time that the ACPI PM timer support landed, but
apparently not. :(
On systems that do not support the HPET legacy functions (basically the
IBM x460, but there could be others), in time_init() we accidentally
fall into a PM timer conditional and set the vxtime_hz value to the PM
timer's frequency. We then use this value with the HPET for timekeeping.
This patch (which mimics the behavior in time_init_gtod) corrects the
collision.
Andi, any objections or suggestions for a better way?
thanks
