Well, in fact our tunable would need to be independent of PAGES_FOR_IO so that
the memory shrinker could free some spare memory for the drivers.

Yes, that's why I said I wasn't sure whether or not the additional tunable was
needed.
Still, with the notifiers we have a chance to handle the problem automatically
and the tunable would require the user to set the right value.
