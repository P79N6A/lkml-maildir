Actually I queued Dotan's patches quite a while ago, although Linus
seems to be ignoring my pull requests.
I don't see any urgency in adding more similar patches to 2.6.23,
since AFAIK 2.6.23 builds fine, right?
Also I would prefer to get ehca patches from the ehca people at IBM,
or at least an ack from them.
