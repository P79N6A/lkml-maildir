Hello, list!
I found a bug with the tun device: when it auto-registers with devfs,
the softlink is set to "misc/net/tun", but the softlink itself is in
/dev/net, so this link points to /dev/net/misc/... which, ofcourse,
does not exist. This then results in a dead link.
Can anyone think of a clean fix for this?
(I haven't done any serious programming for some time and thus can
only think of some VERY dirty fixes atm)
Regards,
Jeroen
