I do.  That is the format of the information the kernel expects,
so it is the easiest and simplest way to go.  And since it is relatively
simple to strip off the real mode code from the rest and enter
the kernel at 1MB in 32bit mode that is what I do.  
I even have code that will enter the kernel in 16bit and run the normal
setup code but that frequently hits BIOS calls that are confused by
having had a kernel running.  The plan when I get beyond booting
linux kernels similar things is to use a modified version of Bochs
BIOS code to provide the handful of BIOS calls that are needed to
boot most kernels.
The kexec on panic case is a little different and it requires
a kernel that is built to run at an address other than 1MB.  So I load
specially built vmlinux instead of messing with the bzImage at all.
And for booting it making BIOS calls is simply not an option, as the
machine is in a weird state.

Hmm. It currently sits at 256 bytes.  Which is 2 to 3 lines of text
which is not too bad, and an easy limit to raise if it is a problem.
My impression is that the limit at 256 bytes is has always been a
kernel implementation issue rather than a protocol issue.  With
a little care even the old protocol could probably do 32K command
line.

Agreed. You always get a can and mouse game with when you are
upgrading these things.  
However it would be simple to present user space with a single
interface, by doing something like:
        if (strstr(command_line, "BOOT_LOADER=") != 0) {
        	snprintf(command_line + strlen(command_line),
			COMMAND_LINE_SIZE, " BOOT_LOADER=0x%02x",
                        LOADER_TYPE);
        }
At which point a upgrading bootloaders could be done piecemeal with
user space simply needing to learn about the new bootloader strings.
