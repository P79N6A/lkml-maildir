Subject: [ANNOUNCE] GIT 1.4.1.1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The latest maintenance release GIT 1.4.1.1 is available at the
usual places:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/
  git-1.4.1.1.tar.{gz,bz2}			(tarball)
  git-htmldocs-1.4.1.1.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  git-manpages-1.4.1.1.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.4.1.1-1.$arch.rpm	(RPM)
The primary purpose of this release is to fix the breakage
people reported while cloning large quantity of data via git
protocol, and the server side incorrectly timing out.  I am very
sorry for the breakage.
A big thanks goes to Matthias Lederhofer who fixed the breakage
for us.  The fix was cherry-picked from the "master" branch.
The "master" branch has the same fix already and we will have an
1.4.2-rc2 sometime this week, hopefully soon.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since v1.4.1 are as follows:
Junio C Hamano:
      Makefile: tighten git-http-{fetch,push} dependencies
Linus Torvalds:
      revision.c: fix "dense" under --remove-empty
Matthias Lederhofer:
      upload-pack: fix timeout in create_pack_file
Robin Rosenberg:
      Empty author may be presented by svn as an empty string or a null value.
