	I was designing a USB based device and was looking through the 2.4.5 kernel
code, and noticed that while it supports bulk, iso, and control types, there
is no support for interrupt types.  A grep through the entire kernel source
code reveals that USBDEVFS_URB_TYPE_INTERRUPT defined in
linux/usbdevice_fs.h, but no where is it used.  Any thoughts as to why that
might be?
	A google search didn't seem to turn up any answers either.
