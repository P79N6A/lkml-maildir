Yes we should, but I think the inotify interface would be cleaner if we
just factored out this permission code and called it from open() and
from the inotify code.

I don't see how passing directories/files to inotify by fd not filename,
makes providing a write(2) interface to inotify any easier. To me they
are mutually exclusive. When you open up /dev/inotify, you get an fd,
you read events from it. We could provide write on that fd instead of
the ioctl() interface.

Yes the current method of passing the name back to user space is
definitely sub par. But I don't think passing a full path to user space
is reasonable, as that would require walking the dirent tree for every
event. Really the best we can provide user space is the filename/dirname
(relative to the directory you are currently watching).
