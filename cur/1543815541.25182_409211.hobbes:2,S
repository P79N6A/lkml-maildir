Mark, thanks for doing this work.  The better abstracted out the
so-called generic MSI support code is, the better.  Several platforms
will benefit from this, such as PPC and Sparc64, both of which
cannot take advantage of MSI support in their PCI controllers because
of how x86 centric the current MSI support layer is.
Thanks again.
