Tony,
It had been suggested that we submit this as new code - since it can't be transitioned to. And I 
thought that was what we had decided on - a 'kill' patch and an 'add' patch. I can remove any 
Lindent'ing of older files if you don't want that. I will take out the Kconfig mod. I believe 
Christoph is the maintainer of the qla driver (he was one of the reviewers).
