Good morning,
currently, there is no way for an external application to monitor whether a
filesystem or underlaying block device has hit an error condition - internal
inconsistency, read or write error, whatever.
Short of parsing syslog messages, which isn't particularly great.
This is necessary for server monitoring in general.
I don't have a real idea how this could be added, short of adding a field to
/proc/partitions (error count) or something similiar.
Comments?
Sincerely,
    Lars Marowsky-Brée <lmb@suse.de>
