(it is against latest bk, which may differ from bk12...)
Unfortunately generic portion is much larger than before, as new
logo code tries to look at info.fix and info.var before it calls
set_par() first time (at least after my other patches; I'll investigate
it further). And matroxfb does not contain anything valid
in info.fix before you call set_par()...
Change console size at runtime at your own risk (using fbset, not
stty), and remember that due to James's changes you have to use 
video=matroxfb:xxx instead of video=matrox:xxx... on kernel command line
(which pointed to me that it is time to get Grub as Debian's LILO 
is limited by 256 chars kernel cmdline :-( )
