the goal was not to optimize those workloads - the goal was to (try to) 
validate those irq trampoline changes / cleanups. We went with hpa's 
changes in the end which compresses the trampolines - that reduces the 
$icache footprint which is hard to measure but a very real concern on 
real workloads.
