Hi Jesper,
 my initial kernel was voluntary@100HZ. I have switched to 300HZ, but
have not observed much difference. The config is now:
config-2.6.22-rc7:# CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE is not set
config-2.6.22-rc7:CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY=y
config-2.6.22-rc7:# CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set
config-2.6.22-rc7:CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL=y
Cheers
