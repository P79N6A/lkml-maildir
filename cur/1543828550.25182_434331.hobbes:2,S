If it happens to you... you needed a new cpu anyway. Anything non-historical
*has* thermal protection.
BTW I doubt those old athlons can be saved by cli; hlt . (Someone willing to try if old
athlon can run cli; hlt code w/o heatsink?).
And no, we probably do not want to enter C2 or C3 from doublefault handler.
