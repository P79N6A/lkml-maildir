  a) it's already been discussed to death (just search for 'fuse' on
     lkml and fsdevel)
  b) I don't consider it a good idea to ship a defunct version of it in
     the mainline
Can you please accept my wish to have FUSE merged _with_ the
unprivileged mount's thing.
If anybody has anything to add to the discussion, please do it now,
and not later.  Delaying this further won't get us any bonus IMO.
