_spin_unlock does not need locked operations because when it is run, the
code is already known to be the only one to hold the lock, so it can
release it without checking what others do.

It does not work. You cannot write an inter-cpu atomic test-and-set with
several unlocked instructions.

==> here, another thread or CPU can get the lock simultaneously.

well, of course with those methods you can improve performance, but you
lose the warranty that you're alone to get a lock, and that's bad.
another similar method to get a lock in some very controlled environment
is as follows :
  1:  cmp $0, %0
      jne 1b
      mov $CPUID, %0
      membar
      cmp $CPUID, %0
      jne 1b
This only works with same speed CPUs and interrupts disabled. But in todays
environments, this is very risky (hyperthreaded CPUs, etc...). However, this
is often OK for more deterministic CPUs such as microcontrollers.

Willy
