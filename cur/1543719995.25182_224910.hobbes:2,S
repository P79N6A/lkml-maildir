I am routinely building and booting *-mm kernels on Altix systems.  For
example, the 2.6.7-rc2-mm2 kernel I made from Andrews patch set of last
night works fine.  His patch set 2.6.7-rc2-mm1 had "issues", but
apparently not just on Altix.
I'd guess that Linus's kernels, such as 2.6.7-rc2, unpatched, are ok too,
but I don't have actual experience with them of late.
I don't know about the kernel/ports/ia64/v2.[46] patches.  I am not
adding any such for my work, at least not lately.

Probably - but I don't know where.
