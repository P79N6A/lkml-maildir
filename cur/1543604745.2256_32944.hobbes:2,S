Really? What hardware do they see in /dev/? Do their servers have for
example mouse? What about ethernet cards?
Does /proc/kmem work in virtual servers?
[Why I'm asking? I'm trying to find ways to take over the machine. Do
you want to give me root on your machine stating that I can't
interfere?]
You might want to announce this on bugtraq. [And give solar designer
root account, he might be more creative ;)].
