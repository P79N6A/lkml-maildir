With absolute paths you can move the symlink.  But the other side

And to state the obvious, you must make certain your fs has a lot of
inodes because this dramatically changes the inode to fs block ratio.

I like it.  It's not too hard and it yields a very nice result.
syscall wise we would need:
int cowlink(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
int cstat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf);
Which of course are non POSIX :)

The practical use was getting root on a network filesystem to scale,
and be manageable.  But the problem is essentially the same.  Although
to guard against network congestion interacting badly with paging we
were actually thinking about implementing copy on read.

And that is what the prototype we were playing with was doing.  You
could not see the original files at all unless you mounted the base
filesystem somewhere outside the cowfs mount.  It was actually quite
close to your special cow inode idea except that it stored data in
symlinks instead of inodes.  To the extent of freeing files if all of
the cow links to them were removed, and the files were store on the
same filesystem as the cow links. 
The addictive thing about the prototype implementation was that you
could do ``ln --cow / /some/other/directory'' and you would have an
atomic snapshot of your filesystem.  Definitely not a feature for the
first implementation but certainly something to dream about.
