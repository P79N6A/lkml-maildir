well if you currently have 1tb in 8 non-redundant drives then you using 
160GB disks... no?
the biggest p-ata disks right now are ~320GB so you can do a ~1TB software 
raid 5 stripe on a single 4 port ata controller such as a promise tx4000 
using regular software raid rather than the promise raid. that would end 
up being fairly inexpensive and buy you more protection.
linux software raid hsa been as releiable as anything else we've used over 
the years, the lack of reliabilitiy in your situation will come entirely 
from failing disks, lose one and your filesystem is toast.
