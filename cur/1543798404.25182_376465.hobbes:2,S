I wouldn't expect very much.

The Opteron caches are write back afaik - this means data only leaves
the L2 cache when other data pushes it out.
But the additional traffic on the interconnect was likely negligible. 
If anything I would expect the reduced latency when a user space program eat up all 
cache and the PDA is needed on the next kernel entry to be helpful.
But it's not very much at least on an Opteron because the NUMA factor
isn't that bad. On Kiran's machines which likely have a higher NUMA 
factor I guess it helps more.
