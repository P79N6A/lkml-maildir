On ix86 machines, regardless of whatever code initialized the
hardware, if the screen-card is not put into graphics mode,
anybody can write characters and attributes at 0xb8000 directly
to the screen. Even user-mode code can mmap() that area and write
to it. So, the key seems to be to get out of graphics mode
before suspend, and go back later after resume.
Cheers,
