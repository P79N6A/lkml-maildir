Thanks guys, that sort of fixes it, but not really.  Occasionally i get
a big load of IO (copying tens of megs of log files around), and even if
i synced a second before, now there's tens of seconds of IO in the queue,
and my next fsync() still drags on.
Really i just want this one process to go to the front of the queue, any
time it has IO to do, independent of what the rest of the system is doing.
