My brother has a Libretto with a Crusoe, he mentioned something about
X11 crashing, but since his graphics chip seems to have given up the
ghost it is hard to check if it was the CMS or the ATI chip.
I was afraid that my graphics chip would have the same problem, so I
am somewhat relieved that it is the Crusoe.
