I think the problem is that the tap detection in mousedev.c is very
simplistic. It always generates a button click if the time between
"finger down" and "finger up" is small enough, even if the finger was
moved a large x/y distance. The X driver handles this with another
parameter that specifies the maximum allowed distance. If the finger
moved more than this distance, no button event is generated.
