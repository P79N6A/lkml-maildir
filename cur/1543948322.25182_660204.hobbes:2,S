I don't buy your argument. It's essentially saying that a scheme that can't
detect all possible problems is useless, even if it can detect some
problems.

This is akin to "Maybe I was swerving, but I must have been driving safely
because I wasn't drunk". Everyone who drives drunk isn't safe, but it
doesn't follow that you're safe just because you're not drunk.
This is an obviously-wrong argument, and the fact that someone can make it
isn't interesting. People can make all kinds of obviously-wrong arguments.
Maybe this is a documentation issue.
The GPL exports mark symbols that someone felt could not be used in a
non-derivative work, "intimate details" if you like. But whether or not
something is a derivative work is a pure question of copyright law and the
nature of what was taken. (One could make an argument that not marking
symbols acts as some kind of estoppel against later arguing that just
minimally using that symbol can't make your work a derivative. It's possible
a judge might by that argument, but if so, how is that unreasonable?)

I don't think anybody really knows what legal effect that will have. I can
speculate, but I don't know that my speculations are particularly
interesting. If anyone wants my analysis of that, feel free to email me
off-list.

It's fine either way. Whatever you feel about non-GPL-only symbols, there's
nothing wrong with marking some symbols that, in the opinion of their
copyright holders, cannot be used by non-derivative works. If this is what
the GPL symbol marking does (which is what was agreed to when it was added)
then there's no harm.

All you can do in code is implement technical things. You cannot enforce or
implement the license because the GPL prohibits that.

If you're arguing that GPL symbol export has outlived its usefulness, that
might be true. I don't really have an opinion one way or the other.
