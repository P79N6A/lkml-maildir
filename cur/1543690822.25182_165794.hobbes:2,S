Exactly, then your first statement above is bogus.

Apart from using incorrect cache line alignments on P4, an i386 kernel
is no more, no less generic than one compiled with X86_GENERIC

Incidentally, looking closer you broke this option.
+ifdef CONFIG_CPU_VIAC3_2
+  cpuflags-y  := $(call check_gcc,-march=c3,-march=i686)
+endif
Its C3_2 becauase it needs -march=c3-2 to use SSE instead of 3dnow
prefetches.  One thing that just occured to me, it may be possible
to dispose of this option completley now that Andi's runtime
patching code is in. If I get time I'll take a look at that.

That should be solved using CONFIG_X86_GENERIC, not fuglifying the Makefiles.
Seriously, I think this is completely the wrong approach. Seriously, how many
mails does l-k get of people saying, "Oh duh, my no booting kernel was
because I chose to compile for Athlon, and I have a Pentium 4" or the likes?
This seems to be a solution in search of a problem.

X86_USE_3DNOW would seem more logical to me. I never checked if this
was a win on C3, but as that also has 3dnow its possibly worth looking into.

I'm not talking about running it on a 386. I'm talking about running
a kernel _compiled as 386_, on a PPro which has the bug this fixes.
With your patch, this code does nothing, and the bug doesn't get worked
around. Currently, it does the right thing. You're saving a half dozen
or so bytes, and making things like vendor boot kernels (typically
compiled as 386) not perform a necessary errata workaround.
And "You can select 486/586/686 too" is not an answer. These kernels
need to be small, and errata workarounds should NEVER be compiled out
for exactly this reason.

That doesn't solve the 'looks ugly as all hell' problem.
