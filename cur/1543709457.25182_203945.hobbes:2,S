Just wondering on how to build a kernel-level facility which would
require shared libraries and executables to be "keyed" or even
"signed" to run on linux.
This is to prevent execution of software not specifically authorized.
Applications:
- Improve security
- License management
- Prevent unauthorized software installation
- Black-listing e.g. SCO libraries and executables
Regards
Michael
