 From looking at the information supplied, NTFS doesn't seem to be 
involved. The processes seem to be stuck trying to write dirty buffers as 
well as in nfs and pipefs - buffers could never get dirtied by the current 
NTFS as it is entirely read-only.
btw. You had sent a problem report about cyrillic names with NTFS and I 
suggested to try the new NTFS driver but you never got back to me whether 
that fixed it or not... How is the new driver behaving? Are you stil seing 
problems or is everything working fine now?
Best regards,
Anton
