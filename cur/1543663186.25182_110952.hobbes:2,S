Hi,

Don't do this, indentation is now derived from the dependencies. Adding 
spaces helps 'make config' but not really the other front ends.
The correct fix would be to change JBD into:
config JBD
	bool
	default y
	depends on EXT3_FS
Now the following JBD_DEBUG entry should be an entry under EXT3_FS,
but unfortunately there seems to be bug somewhere, it's inserted to high 
in the menu tree. As a work around you can add EXT3_FS as dependency to 
JBD_DEBUG, I'll look into it as soon as possible.
bye, Roman
