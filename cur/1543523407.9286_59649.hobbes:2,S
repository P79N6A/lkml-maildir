Sure there's middle ground.  If you don't trust it and 8 bits only has the
entropy of 4 random bits, then its useless as key material, but quite good to
throw into the /dev/random pool. /dev/random's entropy estimate may be wrong,
but that's not a disaster given the robustness of its mixing algorithms.
