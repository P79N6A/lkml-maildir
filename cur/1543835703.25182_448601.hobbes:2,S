Ehr: Such a migration (on a very busy system) takes *some* time (weeks).
Re-Doing (migrate users back / recreate the FS / start again) the whole

Let's face it: Shit happens and nobody is perfect. A filesystem should
be flexible (modern..) and support Admin/User-needs.
We wouldn't need ECC / Raid / UPS's in a perfect world.
