Subject: [patch] Don't assume arguments to init have no period in them.

The kernel assumes that nobody will ever legitimately feed in a kernel command 
line option with a period in it, and the kernel is wrong: I'm feeding the 
path to a script as an argument to my init program, the name of the script 
ends in .sh.
I've been using this patch ever since 2.6.13, and I still need it.
