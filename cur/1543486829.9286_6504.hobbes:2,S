Hi,
I just patches the kernel from 2.2.1 to 2.2.1ac6, due to the chgrp bug.
The problem that appeared is that lxdialog now dumps core when it is
called. Dumps core because of a sig11.
I checked the ncurses version. Alle are OK, and no double headers are in
the /usr/include or /usr/include/ncurses.
Any hints, suggestions to get it working again ??
I'm willing to send you the corefile if needed.
Also notice that the bug didn't occur in 2.2.1
Regards,
Igmar Palsenberg
