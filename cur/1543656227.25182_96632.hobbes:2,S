Wow, is that still on a website somewhere?
So as you may know from looking at the spec, Metolious was a spec that
defined a way for platforms to enumerate various motherboard sensors to the
OS, for manageability purposes.
It never took off, except for a couple companies that used the Windows
driver for other things because they didn't want to write a driver that
received ACPI device Notify()s.
The licensing may be weird, but given that there really is no point in
implementing it on Linux, does that really matter?
