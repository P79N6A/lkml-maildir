Hmmm... Good ideas. I think it could be much simpler like the following 
patch.
However, the problem here is how to know that we really took the anon_vma 
lock and what to do about a page being unmmapped while migrating. This 
could cause the anon_vma not to be unlocked.
I guess we would need to have try_to_unmap return some state information.
I also toyed around with writing an "install_migration_ptes" function 
which would be called only for anonymous pages and would reduce the 
changes to try_to_unmap(). However, that also got too complicated.
