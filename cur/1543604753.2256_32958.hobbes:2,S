I have not been able to successfully mount a ufs partition.  I've been
pouring through as much info as I can dig up on this.  The most
revealing info I find points to a broken ufs module.  Is that the
case?  To be honest, this is the first time I've had to mount a
FreeBSD UFS partition and this could all be user error.
Specifically, I've done this:
# mount -t ufs -o ufstype=44bsd /dev/hdc7 /mnt/ufs/
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdc7,
       or too many mounted file systems
This does load the ufs module (as confirmed by lsmod).
fdisk shows:
Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/hdc: 16 heads, 63 sectors, 39704 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 1008 * 512 bytes
8 partitions:
#       start       end      size     fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  a:        1         7*        6*    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16
  b:        7*       72*       65*      swap
  c:        1      2492*     2491*    unused        0     0
  e:       72*       75*        2*    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16
  f:       75*     2492*     2416*    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16
Any help would be appreciated.
