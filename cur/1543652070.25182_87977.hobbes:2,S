Rusty,
your EMail address (Rusty Trivial Russell <@rustcorp.com.au>) 
is broken. I'm replying to linux-kernel instead.
I had reported this problem a long time (over a year at least) 
to the list. I found no 100% solution that is compatible with 
the old kernel version.
Best solution would be to separate the NTP functionality 
(ntp_adjtime, ntp_gettime) from adjtime() in the kernel.
I wonder how adjtime(NULL, non_null) is implemented:
If "modes == 0" adjtimex() will emulate ntp_gettime()
if "modes & ADJ_OFFSET_SINGLESHOT" is set with "txc->offset == 
0", the current correction will be stopped.
You must distinguish it from a call to adjtime(non_null, 
non_null) with an offset of 0 that will terminate the current 
correction.
(Manual says: "The second call to adjtime() stops the first 
call to adjtime() if delta is non-NULL, but does not undo the 
effects of the previous call. If delta is NULL, then no time 
correction will be done.")
If adjtimex() still should implement both library styles 
(ntp_*, and adjtime()), the clean solution would be a new flag 
like ADJ_OFFSET_QUERY (or ADJ_OFFSET_NO_SHOT or 
ADJ_OFFSET_PEACE).  [Well I'm beginning to like the last one ;-
)]
If adjtime(NULL, any) is used in Clib, adjtimex would have to 
be called with the ADJ_OFFSET_PEACE flag, avoiding to disturb 
the adjustment. If `any' is non-NULL, the offset would be 
returned to user land.
Rehards,
Ulrich
