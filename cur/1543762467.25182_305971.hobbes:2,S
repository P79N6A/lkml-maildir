I agree with this sentiment; this is mainly a policy decision that 
kernel programmers should not make.
Certainly _by default_ the RNG should not be run "full blast" all the 
time.  This is a needless CPU soaker.
This is another example of why the userspace rngd is useful:  it is 
trivial to implement "CPU soaker" policy if you wish, or use the default 
"don't eat all my CPU" policy.

That's a policy decision to be made by the user, not you.
Some users may wish to use RNG directly.

A kernel driver cannot know in advance that the data from a hardware RNG 
is truly random, unless the data itself is 100% validated beforehand.
