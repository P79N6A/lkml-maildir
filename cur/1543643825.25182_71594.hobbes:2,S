This was and is true with the kernel before 2.5.3<mumble> when Ingo 
introduced TLS support since the thread specific data had to be 
addressed via LDT entries and the LDT holds at most 8192 entries.  The 
GDT based solution now implemented in the kernel has no such limitation 
and the number of threads you can create with the new thread library is 
only limited by system resources.
