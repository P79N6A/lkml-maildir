The paranoid path is used for more than just NMIs; it's also used for MCEs,
stack faults, double faults or debug exceptions. Anything that might
happen with a invalid stack or unknown GS state or system in other unknown
state.
If you can guarantee your hypervisor never injects any of those it could be ignored; 
but at least losing debug exceptions would be probably not nice.

This was really a general comment not especially applying to the 
paranoid path.
