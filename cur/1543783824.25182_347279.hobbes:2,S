Sean:
Linux isn't just used by kernel developers. It's that attitude that helps insure
Linux will always have a small userbase. Lack of numbers just gives the manufacturers
another reason not to care about us. Joe User doesn't care about our philosophical
issues, nor should he. When I install Linux on someone's machine, he wants it to work
NOW, not in some 'perfect-world' future.
