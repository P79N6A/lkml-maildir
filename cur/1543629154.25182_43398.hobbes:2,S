.. but the _design_ is bad (limited usability anywhere else). And my
suggested interface is actually likely to generate better code, ie instead
of having two tests (one inside "pte_valid_page()", and one on the return
value), you'd only have one (in "valid_pfn()").
The whole notion of "pte_valid_page()" is horrible: you're doing two
_completely_ different things in the function - validation and "pte->page"
conversion. That's bad programming.
