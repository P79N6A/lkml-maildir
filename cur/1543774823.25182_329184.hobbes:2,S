As I just posted in another thread, with this boot I am now getting a 
huge amount of almost strace like detail being output to VT1 from 
kde's/kmails activities.  VT1 being the console I did the startx 
from.  Could this be related to commenting out that line in sched.c?
Sorta new subject next.
Getting all that detail being output to VT1, is there any way I can 
enlarge the VT's scrollback memory buffer?  It's only about 2kb, 
maybe less, less than 2 full screens full.  I'm used to haveing about 
a 10 meg scrollback buffer available for traceing purposes in an x 
console.  I'd appreciate the same length of scrollback for the VT's.
