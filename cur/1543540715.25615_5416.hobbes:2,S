      3) Even 2.2.16 doesn't seem to contain code for Serial sysrq
   Given that we're talking about the config.in file for the 2.4 tree, this
   is somewhat irrelevant.
Also, people should check some non-x86 serial drivers :-) I'm pretty
sure some of our Sparc serial drivers support sysrq just fine.
