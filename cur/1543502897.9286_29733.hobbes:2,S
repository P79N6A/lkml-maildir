Eh? The original context was about performance. However, I've never seen a
genuinely threaded solution developed more rapidly than an event driven
version might be.

In some programs this may be significant, but I wouldn't agree this is
broadly true. I find the constant drift towards programs that have more
complex interactions with their environment has, over the years, forced the
explicit codifying of at least some state information in almost all programs.
Only programs with the simplest of interactions with the outside world could
completely avoid this.

In most event oriented programs the "run this event to completion" strategy
works well. This ensures the minimum of wastage in context switching, and can
usually achieve the highest total throughput. That tends to be the fairest of
them all. I've never found this a major drag on my development resources.

There are a number of threaded programs with virtually no thread-to-thread
interaction. In other words they have no need to be threaded at all.
Independent, or minimally co-operating traditional Unix processes would
achieve much same result, with greater task-to-task protection. They have no
real threaded qualities, and present no particular debug problems.
There are other threaded programs which really take advantage of threads, and
introduce numerous asynchronous interactions. Try convincing someone
developing life critical apps. that these are amenable to thorough debug.
I'm not a thread hater. They are a valuable tool for SMP scaling, and an
elegant way to implement certain programs. They are very much oversold,
though. I don't like the attitude I see too often that "I'll be old fashioned
if I don't use threads". Its rather like "I'll be old fasioned if I don't use
NT", and just about as good for system reliability.
