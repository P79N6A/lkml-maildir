I applied the patchset to 2.6.0-test3-mm2 and compiled.  Other than some 
extra lines in dmesg output no user observable change in behaviour was 
noted.  In other words I couldn't see any differences between using this 
patchset and using stock yenta code.  
Never having used the suspend/hibernate/resume on my laptop I could 
neither test nor comment on that aspect.  Sorry about that.
My laptop is a Presario 12XL325 and I use an SMC 2632W wireless ethernet 
adapter in the PCMCIA slot.
