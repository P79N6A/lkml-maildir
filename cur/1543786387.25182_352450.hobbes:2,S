No, hiwater_vm is exactly what we need. Before hiwater_vm I had my own patch
to get exactly the same result but the member was called "peak_vm" instead.
Most software we develop at my work uses this to test for regression
in memory usage. Just before program exit it reads /proc/pid/status:VmPeak
and reports it. Scripts do the rest.
