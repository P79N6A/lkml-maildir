[test shows that NCQ makes no difference whatsoever]

Well.  It looks like the results does not depend on the
elevator.  Originally I tried with deadline, and just
re-ran the test with noop (hence the long delay with
the answer) - changing linux elevator changes almost
nothing in the results - modulo some random "fluctuations".
In any case, NCQ - at least in this drive - just does
not work.  Linux with its I/O elevator may help to
speed things up a bit, but the disk does nothing in
this area.  NCQ doesn't slow things down either - it
just does not work.
The same's for ST3250620NS "enterprise" drives.
By the way, Seagate announced Barracuda ES 2 series
(in range 500..1200Gb if memory serves) - maybe with
those, NCQ will work better?
Or maybe it's libata which does not implement NCQ
"properly"?  (As I shown before, with almost all
ol'good SCSI drives TCQ helps alot - up to 2x the
difference and more - with multiple I/O threads)
