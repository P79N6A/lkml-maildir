these kinds of problems could be avoided by making the CPU-off as much
of an atomic operation as possible. The less atomic it is, the more
kernel code is exposed to the transitional state - and since this is a
rare situation it will always have quality problems. Is there any killer
argument that makes it impossible to down a CPU atomically? Kernel
threads can get their callbacks on other CPUs just fine. Other tasks
should not care. If the migrate-off operation is done 100% atomically
then zero knowledge is needed by unrelated scheduler code about the act
of disabling a CPU.
