Right, and I see that the removal of start/stop is already in -mm. That's 
not going to work. Something (such as removing power) disabled Ondrej's 
CS4236 and the pnp_start_dev() is needed to re-enable it upon resume.

It seems all PnP drivers would need to stick a pnp_start_dev in their resume 
method then which means it really belongs in core. One important point where 
PnP and PCI differ is that PnP allows to change the resources on a protocol 
level and I don't see how it could ever not be necessary to restore the 
state a user may have set if power has been removed. Hibernate is just that, 
isn't it?
