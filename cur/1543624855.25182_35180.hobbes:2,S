Subject: PROT_SEM in 2.5.7pre1 on Sparc question

Hello,
I am playing around with 2.5.7pre1 on Sparc64 platform.  There's a new flag
definition in mman.h for PROT_SEM set to 0x8.  Right now, the proper def is
not in the sparc tree,  Dave may already have seen this, I diff'd the file
below, if your interested, that will allow the kernel compile to complete.  
I see that this is related to the fast user space mutexes.  I have been
reading up the LKML notes I have found on this, but I am wondering if there
are any implications on this for the Sparc architecture?  I don't have a
working kernel yet for testing.  But was wondering if you had any thoughts
on this.
Thanks
Bruce Holzrichter
