I was just thinking yesterday that it would be good to reenable
interrupts during spin_lock_irq on ppc64.  I am hacking on the
spinlocks for ppc64 at the moment and this looks like something worth
adding.
Why not keep _raw_spin_lock as it is and only use _raw_spin_lock_flags
in the spin_lock_irq{,save} case?
Paul.
