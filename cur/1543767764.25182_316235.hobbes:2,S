I have, on the home box, an issue with alsa
	2.6.12-rc3 works fine
	2.6.12-rc3-rc3, and rc2-xx(forgot) fail
There are unresolved symbols loading snd_via82xx
The box at work is hung at the moment, so I'll check it in the morning,
but it was having problems with
	* bad skb fields on lo
	* ingress filtering was issuing errors
I'll append more in the morning when I can reboot the box
