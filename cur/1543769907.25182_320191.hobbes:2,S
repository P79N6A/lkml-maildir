Are you sure it's actually needed? Have significant scheduling latencies
actually been observed?
Bear in mind that anyone who cares a lot about latency will be running
CONFIG_PREEMPT kernels, in which case the whole thing is redundant anyway. 
I generally take the position that if we're going to put a scheduling point
into a non-premept kernel then it'd better be for a pretty bad latency
point - more than 10 milliseconds, say.
