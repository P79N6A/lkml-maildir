Actually I think this solution is way less ugly. We have precent: if
task is ptraced, suid bits on anything it execs are ignored.
I don't think user interface issues belong to the kernel (and I do not
think different namespaces are that bad for the user; various chroots
and ld_preload hacks already work that way)
