The best place for this define, if it is needed at all, is
in unistd.h.  It seems really silly to have to modify so
many files to add a system call.  If it were not so late in
the game, I would offer up a single file system call thing,
but after 260 calls, well, maybe I will even so, but AFTER
the freeze since it will not add any new features.
