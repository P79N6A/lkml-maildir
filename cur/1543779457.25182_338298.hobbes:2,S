Just to verify that this option works:
1. Using a non hardware mixing device intel8x0, set it to release the
sound device after 5 seconds.
2. In 10 seconds, use aplay or xmms (in ALSA mode, not artsd) to play a
sound.  
3. Then, while the sound is playing, do something that would make KDE
play a sound.
#2 should fail with -EBUSY and you should hear the #3 sound.  If #2
succeeds and #3 fails then KDE is broken IMHO.
