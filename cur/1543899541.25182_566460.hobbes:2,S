I considered that, but your proposal does not allow a single task to
have multiple preemption hooks installed (hookers?!).  Since in general
there's no reason to suppose that users would be mutually exclusive, we
need to have a struct hlist of these things.  All in all this seemed to
indicate that the second user should have the honor of figuring out that
stuff.
