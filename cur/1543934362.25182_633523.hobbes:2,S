Just out of curiosity, how does a host controller manage to avoid
working with external hubs?  Is it a matter of power consumption?  It
seems to me that in all other respects a hub should appear the same as
any other USB device.
Or is it a question of whether the controller works when communicating 
with devices behind an external hub?  And if it is, what is the 
difficulty?
