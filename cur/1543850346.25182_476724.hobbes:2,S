I don't have this hardware, so I can only guess and the less information I 
get the broader I have to guess. Sorry, but currently I don't have the 
time to go on such a broad hunt. Someone familiar with this code should a 
far easier time localizing the problem. It's not just kernel driver, there 
is also lot of code in user space which converts the data to time 
adjustments. There is also more than one way to adjust time, so I need 
more specific information about what is happening and what is expected to 
happen.
bye, Roman
