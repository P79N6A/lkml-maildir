Yes, that's true. I don't see much of a point in leaving it as
BYTES_PER_WORD in the SLAB_RED_ZONE case, at least this wasn't
intentional. Would you accept ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN if this was set
regardless of whether SLAB_RED_ZONE is set or not?
I suppose we can live with align being 0 in the CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB
case as the unaligned accesses are not fatal..
