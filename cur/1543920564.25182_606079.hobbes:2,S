Hmm.  This is interesting because we won't be doing anything that
effects correctness if we don't special case BLKFLSBUF just something
that effects efficiency.  So I think we can get away with just
changing blkflsbuf as long as there is a way to get rid of
the data.

Well I was thinking you can examine the page you just wrote to
and if it is all zero's you don't need to cache that page anymore.
Call it intelligent compression.
Further it does make forwards and backwards compatibility simple
because all you would have to do to reliably free a ramdisk is:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ramX
blockdev --flushbufs /dev/ramX

I guess when I look at this it looks like an operation that
is unique to a ramdisk.  Real hard drives have a low level
format operations and the like.  If we can find something
standard there that is guaranteed to trash your data we
can use that, and have gone from less consistency to more.
