Marcelo, Christoph, et al.,
Thanks for finally including XFS in the vanilla 2.4 tree.  We greatly 
appreciate it.
I hear that the acls and dmapi bits were excluded, but our ~300TB are used 
mainly for online data caching so we don't generally use these features.
Again, thanks for making my life somewhat easier.  :-)
Cheers,
Dan
