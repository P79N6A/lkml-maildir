They didn't describe the test setup, simply supplied a
"go away and don't bother me" picture of something
that means nothing.

I think they just sent you a picture, thinking it would
make you go away. It is a common ploy.

There is a definition of overshoot and undershoot. 10 percent
undershoot will show a 0->3.3 volt signal going 0.33 volts
below "ground," i.e., -0.33 V on peaks. 10 percent overshoot
will show a 0->3.3 volt signal going to 3.63 volts above ground
on peaks, i.e., +3.63 volts.

This may be a "5 volt" bus. 3.3 volt devices are supposedly
5 volt tolerant. For instance, the PLX, PCI 9656BA, probably
the most common PCI interface chip in use, will handle those
voltages fine. The actual logic-level switch occurs at about
1.5 volts. Since the PCI bus is clocked, it is unlikely
that a "lockup" you describe is caused by the bus, more
likely a hung DMA operation caused by a failure to handle
errors (hardware or software, cause unknown). With the
chip I describe, it can be programmed so that it will not
hold the bus "forever," with a hung DMA operation. However,
some cooperation with the stuff in your FPGA as well as
the software in the driver is necessary.
