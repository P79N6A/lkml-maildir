I would suggest using a USB 1.1 hub instead if you have to use this kind
of hardware set up.  I think the core is just not able to schedule so
many interrupt urbs with such a setup, running USB 1.1 devices behind a
USB 2.0 hub like this is a very difficult thing to do.
Sorry I don't have a better solution.
