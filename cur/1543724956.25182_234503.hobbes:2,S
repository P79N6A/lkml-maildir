I tested this...
   With HZ=1000:
     - normal boot: calibrate_delay() took 23 milliseconds
     - specifying lpj=xxx: calibrate_delay() took 43 microseconds.
   With HZ=100:
     - normal boot: calibrate_delay() took 264 milliseconds
     - specifying lpj=xxx: calibrate_delay() took 43 microseconds.
No adverse behaviour was observed.
This will be a big improvement for embedded folks.
Thanks,
