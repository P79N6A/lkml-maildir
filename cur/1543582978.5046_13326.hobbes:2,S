Can anyone explain why this test is in routine `do_coredump'
in file `fs/exec.c' in the 2.4.0 kernel?
    if (!current->dumpable || atomic_read(&current->mm->mm_users) != 1)
	goto fail;
The only thing the test on `mm_users' seems to be doing is stopping
a thread process from dumping core.  What's the rationale for this?
