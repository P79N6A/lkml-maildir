The only machine I have with gcc-3.x takes an amazing amount of time to
compile a quite minimal kernel then barfs in headers_install with
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
make[1]: `scripts/unifdef' is up to date.
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `|', needed by `asm-generic'.  Stop.
which is a mainline bug, too.  ISTR someone else reported it but I don't
recall it getting fixed.
I think I'll give up on this.  Either someone else fixes it or we merge the
bug into mainline.
