Get an external modem of get a modem that says it's 'DOS compatible'.
I have always used external modems because I don't want my motherboard
smoked during the next lightening storm (I ran a BBS for 20 years).
Winmodems (called losemodems) use your CPU to actually flip bits
up and down. Even if there was a "driver" you would not like it
because every phase-change of the QAM modem carrier would require your
CPU  to extract bits, unscramble, etc.
Real modems have hardware to do this so the CPU only gets involved when
a character or characters have been assembled.
