Hm, I'm on a 4way PPC64 machine with 2.5G RAM.
It can only create 509 pthreads and fails with ENOMEM
on the 510th.
That's not a really big machine, but I expected it to be able
to create somewhere around 8000 threads or so, at least. Especially
as it has a 64bit kernel and lots of memory.
Well...
That's my test app:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>
static void * thread(void *arg)
{
        while (1)
                sleep(10);
}
int main(void)
{
        int err = 0;
        unsigned long i = 0;
        pthread_t t;
        while (!err) {
                err = pthread_create(&t, NULL, thread, NULL);
                i++;
                if (err) {
                        printf("Creating pthread %lu failed with \"%s\"\n",
                                i, strerror(errno));
                        break;
                }
                printf("%lu pthreads created\n", i);
        }
        return 0;
}
