Actually, that's where we were a few years ago with hardware, because nearly 
anything anybody would want to print on a wafer was covered by patents or 
copyrights.  It's getting better by leaps and bounds.  Now, a lot of patents 
have expired, a lot of non-proprietary cores are available, and it's mainly 
the EDM tools that are non-free.  That's where we coders can help.
Until the EDM tools get free, their current owners will continue to dictate 
what you can and can't design.
Regards,
Daniel
