I use modules, here is part of my .config file.
Remark : I've the same problem with 2.4.0-test9-pre9.

modutils version is 2.3.16
I had not the problem with test8, the last one without problem was test9-pre7.
So the problem came with test9-pre8.
The .config file is basically the same as with previous versions.

THIS was the solution .... I've compiled 2.4.0-test9-pre9 with the
drivers/usb/Makefile of the test9-pre7 version of the kernel. I've no more the
'unresolved symbols' and the usb mouse works.
