Okay, I didn't want to do semantic damage but it happened anyway.
There seems to be some kind of unexpected (by me) dependency on list
ordering. There are other ways to mitigate the grabbing at the global
lock (which I've in fact already implemented), although none quite so
effective as the per-page business. Which doesn't mean much as a lock
grab is not going to cost anywhere near as much as inaccurate page
replacement, so drop this one.
Cheers,
Bill
