One way this could be handled fairly nicely (although the method is
maybe too clever to be good) would be to leave the autorepeat up to the
sw, ignore any successive presses without a release and watch whether
the keyboard will start autorepeating the key after 250 msec. If it does
not, then force the key to be released even if we got no release
scancode.
