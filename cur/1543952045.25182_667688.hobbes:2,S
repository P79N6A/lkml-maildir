I'm usually intentionally using just the names, without parameters and
not as inline, in such alias definitions so that in case the name gets used
as a function pointer (arguably unlikely here) there's not going to be
any missing definition or duplicate function instantiation. But from a
functionality point of view, either of the alternatives you suggest is
of course as good.
