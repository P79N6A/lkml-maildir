If Linux stopped sending ACKs for out of order packets your machine would
be pretty much unusable over lossy links (because fast retransmit would
not work properly anymore)  But that of course can be used
to cause your machine to send at least an outgoing packet for each incoming
packet.
There are lots of other similar cases which are not fixable IMHO

You don't need the patch as I pointed out, it can be all done from user space
using tc
But it'll only stop a single attack, but there are lots of other attacks 
possible. 
It would probably be more useful to find out why an attack kills other
systems on your net. I guess you have a fast internet connection (near
your ethernet speed) and you're probably using half duplex ethernet, 
correct?
