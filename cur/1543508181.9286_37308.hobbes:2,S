A better option may be to emulate Samba's way of storing the
archive/hidden/system/read-only bits.
archives/hidden/system are each marked by one of the executable bits.
read-only is taken care of by the write allowed bits.
This way if you decide to restore your files to a samba server share
instead, all your attributes will show up correctly.  Maybe the uid/gid bits
can be used instead to store the extra NTFS attributes.
