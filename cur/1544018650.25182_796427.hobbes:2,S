Linus,
Please pull two dlm fixes for 2.6.29-rc2 from:
 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/teigland/dlm.git for-linus
They both fix bugs with nfs posix locks on gfs2/ocfs2.  The first is triggered
by a posix lock that overlaps another, the second is triggered by any GETLK,
so both are pretty common.
Thanks,
Dave
