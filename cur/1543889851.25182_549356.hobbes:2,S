Not really. I'll change it.

The PS3_DEV_TYPE_* IDs are imposed by the repository, as created by the
hypervisor.
The PS3_MATCH_ID_* IDs are created by us, for all PS3-specific devices.
As Geoff already pointed out, we may be able to use PS3_DEV_TYPE_* IDs for
everything, but unfortunately not all PS3-specific devices are present in the
repository.

Oops, forgot to uncomment it (it was a bit noisy while I lived with DEBUG
defined ;-)

It's not for inserting DVDs, only for new devices showing up in the repository.
Apparently new devices may keep on showing up a while after boot up, but I
think this matters only for the kboot kernel, that's why I went with the
exponential back-off with upper limit.
