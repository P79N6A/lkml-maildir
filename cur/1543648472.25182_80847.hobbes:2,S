After having looked at it, device_shutdown is correct enough and
close enough to what I need, that I no longer care about the exact details.
Just so long as sys_reboot calls always calls it, and kexec can call it.
If you can talk someone into improving it's implementation that is fine
with me.  As I find drivers that are causing problems problems because they
won't shut up I will point the driver authors in the direction of whatever
the current kernel api is.
