Subject: [PATCH] [1/8] CPA: Remove my copyright notice
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Not much left from the original code and I don't want my name 
on it because there is code in there I disagree with.
I don't think any of the Ben inspired code is left in there
either, but I left his name in for now.
