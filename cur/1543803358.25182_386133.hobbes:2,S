No this is too much! I wouldn't expect this.
Just example conversions for each 3 conversion types with full discussion 
(or discussion at all) like we do for all other patches would be enough.
semaphore -> mutex is explained a bit in Documentation/mutex-design.txt
Still missing:
 - semaphore -> completion
 - semaphore -> struct work
