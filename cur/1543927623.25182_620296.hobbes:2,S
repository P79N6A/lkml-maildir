Gidday,
Repeating some old news:
1) As from now, my address as man-pages maintainer has changed
   to mtk.manpages@gmail.com.  (Mail to the old address will
   continue to work for a while, but eventually I will close
   that account.)
2) The list linux-man@vger.kernel.org has been created for
   the purpose of discussing Linux man page bugs, patches,
   and maintenance.  To subscribe, send a message to
   majordomo@vger.kernel.org, with the body:
        subscribe linux-man
Back to the news as usual...
I recently released man-pages-2.68.
This release is now available for download at:
    
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages
    or 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages
    (Note the s/manpages/man-pages/ in these paths;
    a symlink with the old path will exist for
    a limited time.)
Changes in the release that may be of interest to readers of this list are
summarized below.
Cheers,
Michael
(man-pages maintenance is supported by Google, as a Google engineer 20%
project.)
