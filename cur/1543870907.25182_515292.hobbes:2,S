Hi,
I just downloaded the latest kernel drivers, daemon and microcode for
my Intel Wireless card. everything built correctly, the microcode is
placed in /lib/firmware and when running /etc/init.d/ipw3945d-start I
get the following dmesg
ieee80211_crypt: registered algorithm 'NULL'
ieee80211: 802.11 data/management/control stack, git-1.1.13

What am I doing wrong?
