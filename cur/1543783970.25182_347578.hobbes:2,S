The numbering is board-specific, but in most cases that can be simplified
to being SOC-specific.  In this case I numbered the SPI-capable controllers
(from 1..7, not included in this patch) and this one came out "2".  The
consistency matters, not the actual (nonzero) numbers.
Hotpluggable SPI controllers are not common, but that's where that sysfs
API to define new devices would really hit the spot.  That would be how the
kernel learns about "struct spi_board_info" structures associated with some
dynamically assigned bus_num.  Likely some convention for dynamically
assigned IDs would help, like "they're all negative".
(What I've seen a bit more often is that expansion cards will be wired
for SPI, so the thing that's vaguely hotplug-ish is that once you know
what card's hooked up, you'll know the SPI devices it has.  Then the
question is how to tell the kernel about them ... same solution, which
again must work without hardware probing.)

Some of the microcontrollers that talk both USB (slave) and SPI (master)
will even run Linux for you.  :)
