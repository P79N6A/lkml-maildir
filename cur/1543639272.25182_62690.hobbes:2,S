What if one thread is doing an RPC call while the other is changing
the 'groups' entry?
Given that the first thread wants both to copy and/or compare the
groups entry what prevents scenarios of the form?
  Thread 1                       Thread 2
                                change cred->ngroups
  copy cred->ngroups
  copy cred->groups
                                change cred->groups
Cheers,
  Trond
