Hi Jasper,
look, the CodingStyle is absolutely right BUT:
	- dropping the braces are good solution for 'if' statement indeed
	- dropping the braces are _not_ good for 'do' - 'while' loop 'case
	  it fails on further loop modifications. Moreover adding these braces
	  we don't change amount of lines in code! So why souldn't we? I don't
	  see any reason not to do.
