For me the most recent stable kernel is 2.6.18.1. 
Normally change for .1 are very small but in this case I got 1, just 1,
reject which I don't know to fix and prefer don't try it. My luck is the
rej in a sparc arch and I can ignore it.
I got this compile error if I don't use CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL in .config
kernel/rtmutex.c:938:48: error: macro "rt_release_bkl" passed 2
arguments, but takes just 1
kernel/rtmutex.c: In function 'rt_mutex_slowlock':
kernel/rtmutex.c:938: error: 'rt_release_bkl' undeclared (first use in
this function)
kernel/rtmutex.c:938: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported
only once
kernel/rtmutex.c:938: error: for each function it appears in.)
