for that you do need to do that from the start of an application, at
which point perfectly good tooling exists already; leak tracking without
full state is, well, not something that'll work too well I suspect.
Also I don't see really why this needs kernel help :)

I suspect this is the only reason for doing it inside the kernel;
anything else still really shouts "do it in userspace via ptrace" to me.

is that true for breakpoints inserted after start?
The reason I ask because... what if half the processed took a COW on the
page with the instruction you want to trap on. Are you going to edit all
those COW'd pages?
Also you no longer have the option to only do it on a selected subset of
processes (eg the workload vs the system)

No instead it gets to "deal" with that already having happened ;)
Overall I see only one possible reason to do this in the kernel:
performance. Anything else really suggests that a userspace approach is
more than reasonable to me. (It might not be always be super easy, but
on the other hand you gain a lot back by doing that, for example you
have a lot better backtrace and debuginformation there so that you can
do far more advanced probes like "probe only if the caller is ..." etc)
