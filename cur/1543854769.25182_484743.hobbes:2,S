I was thinking that if a functional difference was found, it would be
easier to tweak.
There are differences between the ICH8 and ICH9 SATA controller.  For
example, the PCS register now has port present bits that used to be
reserved in ICH8.  I'm not sure how or if these could be used in
ata_piix.
