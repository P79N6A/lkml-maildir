I  disagree. I doubt it's hardware, more likely something is fucked up in the
kernel causing heavy disk usage to fuck with sound. BEAR IN MIND: this happens
whenever I write a CD/copy large volumes of data whilst playing wavs/raw/mp3, with
esd on OR OFF (so it aint esd) - and no heavy CPU usage (typically load is under
20% CPU usage).
