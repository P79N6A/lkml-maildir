Pavel, when you say that 32MB would be 1 second is that due to the limits
of the SATA bus or are you baseing this on a particular drive?
if you are basing it on a current single SATA drive (7200rpm 8MB cache,
etc) consider that if you are writing to a solid state drive or to an
array that presents itself as a single SATA drive then the transaction can
happen MUCH faster.
if this is a limit of the SATA interface bitrate, consider that over the
last several years EVERY interface has seen it's bitrate climb
significantly, frequently with little (if any) fundamentalchange to the
drivers nessasary to run things.
