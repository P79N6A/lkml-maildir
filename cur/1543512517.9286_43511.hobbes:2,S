Subject: VFS: file-max limit 4096 reached in 2.3.19/20 ?

This message (VFS: file-max limit 4096 reached)
shows up just after IPX initialization when booting
2.3.19 / 2.3.20.  
It seems odd to me, I cannot imagine 4096 files
being used at this point, or why it would be a problem?
This is followed by a lot of disk activity, then boot
process moves on initializing unix domain sockets and
ethernet drivers.
