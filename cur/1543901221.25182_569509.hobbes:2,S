What about (9)? Would it be that a user choosing to build a kernel with
hibernate support gets a additional modular kernel built (which he
should then use for resumption) or he should configure & build the
modular kernel independent of main kernel?
Or will the Linux boot procedure change so that it always goes thru a
modular part followed by kexec (just to be uniform)?
Although the kexec approach seems interesting, the final user-scenario
seems a bit complex (or confusing).
