It's not much, agreed, but if the users regular gcc can build the
kernel it's still unnessesary extra bloat to have two gcc's.

That's not what I meant. I meant that building the kernel with
different gcc versions sometimes uncover bugs in the *kernel*.  I was
not talking about finding bugs in gcc.
