... isn't the space thing a workaround for a "diff -p" bug?
Labels should either not have any indent or be indented by tabs (since
some code could presumably benefit from indenting labels). Mass
replacing any labels run through Lindent with space prefixes would seem
like a bad idea :/
(From original reply)
It has a habit of leaving/creating "^\t+ +" too, and that "\t\t/*
comment */$" oddity, I couldn't see any options in the man page to fix
those...
