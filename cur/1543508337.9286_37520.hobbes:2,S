Your proposal is interesting. But why?
What shortcomings of the current approach are you trying to solve which
require the use of floats (in the kernel even!)? Low resolution, short
timespan, the y2.038k problem?

I don't quite think this approach is going to provide you with as high =
a
resolution as you expect, but my memories of how floats work might be f=
lawed.

Hopefully not, but please explain your reasons behind this. Maybe I am =
getting
it all wrong.

Wait until 6.6.6 gets out! It will even be a stable branch, featuring t=
he 4
network layers of the apocalypse! ;-)
