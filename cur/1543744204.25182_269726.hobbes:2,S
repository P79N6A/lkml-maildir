I don't think we have a simple way of syncing all ptes which map the pages
without actually shooting those pte's down, via zap_page_range().  A
filemap_sync() will only sync the caller's mm's ptes.
I guess it would be pretty simple to add a sync_but_dont_unmap field to
struct zap_details, and propagate that down.  So we can reuse all the
unmap_vmas() code for an all-mms pte sync.
It could all get very expensive if someone has a bit of the file mapped
though.  Testing is needed there.
