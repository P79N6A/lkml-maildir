Alpha does not have ftrace enabled in its defconfig, so unless you define 
"relevant configurations" as "dozens and dozens of stupid configs nobody 
uses and that do not matter to 99.9% of the users" i dont see the point.
And the thing is, even if someone wanted to waste serious amount of time 
on crossbuilding to all architectures, a consistent set of crosscompilers 
is not readily available. They are not packaged up properly for distros 
and it's not clear which architecture wants what crosscompiler version 
and binutils setup.
Nor is it clear why kernel developers should slow down their testing 
critical path twenty fold (or more), while it's at most 3 architectures 
that really matter.

Basically via your "nastygrams" you are artificially inflating the 
importance of certain bugreports, well beyond their true importance. You 
are indirectly re-weighting and wasting developer resources that way.
It would be far more important and far more relevant to go over the lists 
on kerneloops.org, or over the bugs in bugzilla.kernel.org than to 
complain that some tree broke Alpha 'again'. Alpha is a stale 
architecture and it shows.
