That breaks cross-export of headers when we don't have a cross-compiler.
I care about this case because it's how we do glibc-kernheaders for
Fedora at the moment -- we build a tarball containing _all_ the headers,
and that tarball is used as source for a separate glibc-kernheaders
package, after reviewing the changes in it.
