Agh!  My eyes!
The above names are way overdone by any measure, but is there any
consensus whether studly-caps in general are discouraged or not?
CodingStyle is vague on the issue, though it kind of implies you should
use underscores when multiple words are needed (the sole example of
studly caps is in a negative context, and a following recommended name
uses underlines).  The kernel source seems pretty random -- they get
used here and there, but more often not; they seem more common in older
code.
If they are discouraged, it might be better to say so explicitly, as
there are many programmers these days who are used to using them.
