The smbfs cache code in 2.4.0 doesn't work with bigmem. For now disable
bigmem or don't use smbfs, it's oopsing all the time.
Rainer Mager reported the same thing yesterday ("Oops with 4GB memory
setting in 2.4.0 stable" if you want to read the thread).
I am currently looking into this ... what kind of server are you
connecting to? win2k/NT4/9x? It is easier to test with those than the more
exotic OS/2 & NetApp.
