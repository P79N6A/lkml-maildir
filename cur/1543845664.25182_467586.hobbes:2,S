It seems you're having interrupt delivery problems or interrupts are
getting lost.
rx_missed_errors indicates frames that were dropped due to the e1000
adapter's fifo getting full and over flowing.

rx_no_buffer_count indicates that the driver didn't return buffers to
the hardware soon enough, but the hardware was able to store the
packet (at the time of reception) in the fifo to try again.
Both these indicate to me that there is something wrong with
interrupts.  Maybe interrupt sharing
can you possibly try a back to back connection with another linux box
and run tcpdump on both ends then ping?  it will tell us if traffic is
truely getting out and coming in okay.
also please send output of lspci -vv and cat /proc/interrupts
