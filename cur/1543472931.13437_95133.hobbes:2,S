You don't have to hack the utility. Just get the docs from AMD's website and
set the MSRs (machine specific regs) accordingly. Very easy.
I wrote a module which did enable Write Allocation for the old K6/K6-2 core.
It's really very easy.
You will however, have a hard time to convince Linus to integrate it into
the kernel. CPU setup is the task of the BIOS. 
But if you do it with beautiful, generic code, he might be convinced ...

 There is  something  frustrating  about  the quality  and  speed  of  Linux
 development.  I.e. the quality  is too high  and the speed  is too high, in
 other words,  I  can implement  this XXXX feature,  but I bet  someone else
 has already done it and is just about to release his patch to Linus soon...
    [From a posting of Tigran Aivazian to linux-kernel, XXXX = disk stat]
