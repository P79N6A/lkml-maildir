I've learned a bit more, and I thought I'd follow up 
on myself:

Mike Galbraith <mikeg@weiden.de> posted an earlier patch
which we would agree should not be applied, but it also
points at the problem in

Since the helper function requires it's argument to
be in ax we can't change the constraint on rw to be "r",
but Mike suggested later that maybe the more of the
helper function could be inlined
In this case when looking at ./arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c
for the helper function __read_lock_failed
It does appear 'short' enough to inline.
What do you think?
.align  4
.globl  __read_lock_failed
__read_lock_failed:
    lock ; incl (%eax)
1:  cmpl    $1,(%eax)
    js  1b
    lock ; decl (%eax)
    js  __read_lock_failed
    ret
I've really appreciate all the email and comments I've
received about this, hope I'm not bugging anyone too much.
 David
PS
    I'm still trying to find documentation for .previous
as info "as" (that comes with binutils GNU ld version 2.9.5 
(with BFD 2.9.5.0.16) doesn't mention .previous)
Does anyone know where this is (or should be) documented
 (Yes, I've seen it mentioned in the assembler sources, but
  shouldn't this be documented in info as?)
