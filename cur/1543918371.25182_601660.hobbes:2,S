Let me guess... Dual core AMD64 ?
I'm 99.99% sure that if you boot with "notsc", the problem disappears. If
so, you have one of those wonderful AMD64 with unsynced clock and without
HPET to sync with. I wrote a simple program in the past to exhibit the
problem. It would bsimply run "date +%s" in a busy loops and display each
time it would change. Amazing. It could jump back and forth by up to 3
seconds!
Basically, it looked like this :
old=$(date +%s)
while : ; do
   x=$(date +%s)
   if [ $x != $old ]; then
      echo "$old -> $x"
      old=$x
   fi
done
