You mention a lot of implementation details that absoultely shouldn't
matter to the userspace interface.
I might not have explained enough what the point behind all this is, so
I'll try to explain it again:
 - the fate of aio, inotify, epoll, etc shows we badly need a generic
   event mechnism that unifies event based interfaces of various subsystem.
   Only having a single mechanisms allows things like unified event loops
   and gives application progreammers the chance to learn that one interface
   for real and get it right.
 - kevent looks like the right way to do this.  but to show it can really
   archive this it needs to show it can do the things the existing event
   systems can do at least as good.  reimplementing their user interfaces
   ontop of kevent is the best (or maybe only) way to show that.
   epoll is probably the easiest of the ones we have, so I'd suggest starting
   with it.  inotify will be a lot harder, but we'll need that aswell.
   the kevent inode hooks you had in your earlier patches will never ever
   get in.
Was this clear enough?
