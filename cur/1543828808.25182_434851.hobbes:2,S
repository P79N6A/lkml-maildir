It would help if the msi code as more than a 3 year old proof of concept
that has intel assumptions all through it.  Things are getting better
but there are still issues there.
I suspect that on x86 hypertransport systems if we directed our writes
to 0xFDF8000000 instead of at 0xfee0000 we would have quite a bit more luck.
Hopefully I can test and confirm that soon.  It is still a trick to get
a card with a working MSI implementation.
My gut feel is what we want is not a while list or a black list but instead
a MSI window driver.  The location and the meaning of the window is on the
edge of being an architectural definition.  But it really isn't and we are
treating it like one.
So I think part of the reason we are having MSI is we are making unwarranted
assumptions.  Once we take a good look at our side and fix that then we
can tell if something was broken.
