I use redhat-7.3 (kernel-2.4.18-4) and this is an ASUS L7300 laptop.
In /etc/modules.conf I have
alias sound-slot-0 opl3sa2
options sound dmabuf=1
alias synth0 opl3
options opl3 io=0x388
options opl3sa2 ymode=2 isapnp=1
and /proc/isapnp looks like

before inserting the module. If I insert the (original) module using 
"modporbe opl3sa2" dmesg read:
ad1848/cs4248 codec driver Copyright (C) by Hannu Savolainen 1993-1996
ad1848: No ISAPnP cards found, trying standard ones...
opl3sa2: ISA PnP activate failed
opl3sa2: No PnP cards found
opl3sa2: 0 PnP card(s) found.
and /proc/isapnp looks as before. My investigations showed that the 
error occures in
isapnp_valid_dma() invoked from isapnp_config_activate() in isapnp.c.
If I insert my patched module I get
opl3sa2: Activated ISA PnP card 0 (active=1)
opl3sa2: chipset version = 0x4
opl3sa2: Found OPL3-SA3 (YMF715E or YMF719E)
ad1848: Interrupt test failed (IRQ5)
opl3sa2: 1 PnP card(s) found.
and /proc/isapnp looks like

Yes, you are right, probably more readable.

I still think this might affect other hardware as well. Does your card 
use the same
irq/prot/dma settings? Does your /proc/isapnp look the same as mine? I don't
quite understand why it works for you.

No problem.
Thanks for your help!
