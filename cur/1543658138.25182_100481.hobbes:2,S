I've seen this in multiple different places, and it seems to be a royal
pain in the butt. Could you log this in Bugzilla (bugme.osdl.org) so
we can track it and get it fixed? I started to log it myself, but realised
I don't really have the required information, or the data to reproduce it.
Bugs logged under Power Mangement / ACPI will automatically go to the ACPI
maintainer ...
Oh, and if you could dump /proc/interrupts, that might help ... last time
I recall some conversation about it generating millions of interrupts,
though that might be fixed by now ...
Thanks,
M
