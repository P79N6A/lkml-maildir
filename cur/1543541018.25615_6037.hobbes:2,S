Me too. I am not sure if I like tunables either. In fact they suck. But
systems that do not work suck even more.
I used to make a living as a VMS tuning consultant, mostly by undoing
whatever the onsite people had been playing with. Later, I got to watch
a few generations of customers (and in house developers) fail to come to
terms with the tuning knobs and levers in the big database servers.
But:
 - we already have a full /proc full of magic tuning
 - as far as I can tell, noone knows how to do it automatically for the
   corner cases, or even just unusual workload mixes
 - and there are lots of high value systems that are tuned just so, and
   will not work with out the tuning.
Bottom line, if we could get rid of tunables, great, but I have no idea
how to do that. And not having them when you need them is much worse
than having them when you don't.
I guess there is a subtheme to my posts today, "the user is often smarter
than the developer thinks".
