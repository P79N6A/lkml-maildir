OK , then how would you make this :
"mke2fs on partition YAHOO1" 
if the label YAHOO1 isn't defined anywhere ?
Off course "mke2fs /dev/hdx --set-label=YAHOO1" is possible , 
but then you are NOT using labels to select a partition.
It is true that making a file system is a one time operation and the admin
"has time" to look up the correct partition , but just using labels is
easier , IMHO.

But if it isn't , then it's not fine. If the FS is corrupted , then
any part of it can be bad , including the label , don't you think so ?
