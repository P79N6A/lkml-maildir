I'm not entirely sure this is safe (I don't know of anything doing it off
the top of my head or any guarantee it should work), but PG_reserved is
an absolute requirement at the very least. ->virtual is likely irrelevant.
Also, COW userspace mappings of such beasts are illegal since the
physical address can't be calculated for do_wp_page() to do its copy.
Codepaths assuming it's in a zone and so on must also be avoided.
You'll need to set VM_RESERVED on the vma, since the page structure
can't be looked up via pte_page(). If you want faults handled on it,
you'll also have to define your own ->nopage() method.
I generally prefer setting VM_RESERVED and prefaulting in ->f_op->mmap(),
though that may not be feasible in some scenarios. Handling this would be
much easier if drivers could override fault handling methods and the like.
