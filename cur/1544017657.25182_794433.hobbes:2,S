+Part III - Debug drivers use of the DMA-API
+-------------------------------------------
+
+The DMA-API as described above as some constraints. DMA addresses must be
+released with the corresponding function with the same size for example. With
+the advent of hardware IOMMUs it becomes more and more important that drivers
+do not violate those constraints. In the worst case such a violation can
+result in data corruption up to destroyed filesystems.
+
+To debug drivers and find bugs in the usage of the DMA-API checking code can
+be compiled into the kernel which will tell the developer about those
+violations. If your architecture supports it you can select the "Enable
+debugging of DMA-API usage" option in your kernel configuration. Enabling this
+option has a performance impact. Do not enable it in production kernels.
+
+If you boot the resulting kernel will contain code which does some bookkeeping
+about what DMA memory was allocated for which device. If this code detects an
+error it prints a warning message with some details into your kernel log. An
+example warning message may look like this:
+

+
+The driver developer can find the driver and the device including a stacktrace
+of the DMA-API call which caused this warning.
+
+Per default only the first error will result in a warning message. All other
+errors will only silently counted. This limitation exist to prevent the code
+from flooding your kernel log. To support debugging a device driver this can
+be disabled via debugfs. See the debugfs interface documentation below for
+details.
+
+The debugfs directory for the DMA-API debugging code is called dma-api/. In
+this directory the following files can currently be found:
+
+	dma-api/all_errors	This file contains a numeric value. If this
+				value is not equal to zero the debugging code
+				will print a warning for every error it finds
+				into the kernel log. Be carefull with this
+				option. It can easily flood your logs.
+
+	dma-api/disabled	This read-only file contains the character 'Y'
+				if the debugging code is disabled. This can
+				happen when it runs out of memory or if it was
+				disabled at boot time
+
+	dma-api/error_count	This file is read-only and shows the total
+				numbers of errors found.
+
+	dma-api/num_errors	The number in this file shows how many
+				warnings will be printed to the kernel log
+				before it stops. This number is initialized to
+				one at system boot and be set by writing into
+				this file
+
+	dma-api/min_free_entries
+				This read-only file can be read to get the
+				minimum number of free dma_debug_entries the
+				allocator has ever seen. If this value goes
+				down to zero the code will disable itself
+				because it is not longer reliable.
+
+	dma-api/num_free_entries
+				The current number of free dma_debug_entries
+				in the allocator.
+
+If you have this code compiled into your kernel it will be enabled by default.
+If you want to boot without the bookkeeping anyway you can provide
+'dma_debug=off' as a boot parameter. This will disable DMA-API debugging.
+Notice that you can not enable it again at runtime. You have to reboot to do
+so.
+
+When the code disables itself at runtime this is most likely because it ran
+out of dma_debug_entries. These entries are preallocated at boot. The number
+of preallocated entries is defined per architecture. If it is too low for you
+boot with 'dma_debug_entries=<your_desired_number>' to overwrite the
+architectural default.
