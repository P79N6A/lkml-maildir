Neat - I had not figured out that the assignmnet took effect
recursively.
I have applied following patch.

Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: restore arch/{ppc/xtensa}/boot cflags
Commit 9a39e273d4df0560c724c5fe71f6314a0583ca2b removed the boot directory
addition to CFLAGS that was being used by the subdirectory builds.  For the
other files, that patch set EXTRA_CFLAGS, but Makefile.build explicitly
sets that to empty as it is explicitly for a single directory only.
Append to KBUILD_CFLAGS instead.
