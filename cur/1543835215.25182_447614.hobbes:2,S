Good point, and limiting this facility to one such timeout per
task_struct seems like a reasonable restriction.  The downsides I can
see about about mapping the tasks' own task struct would be (a) a
potential security leak either now or in the future if some field in
the task_struct shouldn't be visible to a non-privileged userspace
program, and (b) exposing the task_struct might cause some (stupid)
programs to depend on the task_struct layout.  Allocating an otherwise
empty 4k page just for this purpose wouldn't be all that horrible,
though, and would avoid these potential problems.
