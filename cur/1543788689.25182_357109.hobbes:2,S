70 KSLOC is a /lot/, the benefit of having that in kernel would have to be
very large to justify it. And in the frame of an operating system that
believes in flat ("just stream of bytes") interfaces throughout and
hopefully very simple tools on top ("cat", "more", "grep") that are
combined by the user to do complex stuff I just don't see it.
