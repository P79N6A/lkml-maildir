[2nd try, now with coffee]
This is another 3 level locking ordering:
do_rmdir takes the mutex of the parent directory
vfs_rmdir takes the mutex of the victim
shrink_dcache_parent ends up in the reiser delete_inode which takes the
mutex of dead children of the victim
the I_MUTEX ordering rules are
I_MUTEX_PARENT -> I_MUTEX_CHILD -> <normal>
do_rmdir already has I_MUTEX_PARENT, delete_inode does <normal> so
vfs_rmdir needs I_MUTEX_CHILD (which is also logical)
