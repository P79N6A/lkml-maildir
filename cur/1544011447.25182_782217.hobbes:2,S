applied, thanks!
It didnt matter in practice yet, because all uses of sigframe.h were 
single-instance and were done in flat .c files, not in .h files:
 ./arch/x86/kernel/asm-offsets_32.c:#include "sigframe.h"
 ./arch/x86/kernel/signal_32.c:#include "sigframe.h"
 ./arch/x86/kernel/signal_64.c:#include "sigframe.h"
 ./arch/x86/ia32/ia32_signal.c:	struct _fpstate_ia32 fpstate_unused; /* look at kernel/sigframe.h */
but indeed it's better to have this fixed - just in case we put sigframe.h 
into an include file.
