I think it's a good idea to get rid of the ioctl code duplication, but
since the code involved is often subtle, I think it should be tested
on all affected architectures first (or, at least, there should be
some argument as to why the new code is no worse than the old one).
In the particular case of ia64, I'd suggest to ask on
linux-ia64@linuxia64.org for a volunteer to test the patch.
