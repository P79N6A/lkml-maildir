Meanwhile I also found this bugreport (for ubuntu):
  
https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/
+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/26119
which has quite a few "me,too"s, most of them referring to the 
same (as mine) Seagate 40GB model ST340823A, some others to a 
seagate 20GB model.
And, they are better than me at collecting relevant facts ;-)
Btw., this excerpt:
  hdc: Host Protected Area detected.
          current capacity is 78165360 sectors (40020 MB)
          native  capacity is 78165361 sectors (40020 MB)
  hdc: Host Protected Area disabled.
  hdc: 78165361 sectors (40020 MB) w/1024KiB Cache, CHS=65535/16/63, UDMA(100)
  hdc: cache flushes not supported
looked the same for me those days,  but when retrying lately
with a yet unpatched 2.6.18.3, it reported the current capacity
as 78165359 (one less!) (but the native capacity still 78165361)
After patching away the "addr++;", the logs now say:
  hda: 78165360 sectors (40020 MB) w/512KiB Cache, CHS=65535/16/63, UDMA(100)
and I really got 78165360 sectors according to /proc/ide/hda/capacity.
PS:
Will this turn out as:
  "drive is broken, no kernel workaround will be done, end this thread"
or is a real solution in any way realistic?
