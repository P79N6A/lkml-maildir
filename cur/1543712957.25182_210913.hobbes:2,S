The fixing has been done.
This is not yet helpful for app developers, because
old kernels and old libraries are still in use.
If you rely on sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) to work, then
your software will support:
* all systems with a 2.6.xx kernel
* all systems with a 2.4.xx kernel and recent glibc
* all i386 systems running with the default HZ
That's quite a bit I suppose. Maybe you have no
interest in supporting a 1200 HZ Alpha with an old
kernel or glibc. Maybe you don't care about somebody
running a 2.2.xx kernel with modified HZ.
For the moment, I still care. I won't for long.
