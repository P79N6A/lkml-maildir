Actually I did, in the paragraph that you just snipped.

Agreed. However gzip is such an ancient (and presumably now secure) tool that 
it might be unpopular to modify it so heavily. It might also be desirable for 
embedded folks to statically link code.
But, this is now seriously OT for LKML, so I might just email the GNU gzip 
folks and see whether it's been done before and/or whether it's a good idea.
