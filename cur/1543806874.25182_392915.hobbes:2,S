I guess we all experienced that (see everybodies patches).

Maybe we are talking about different things, but I thought our patch-set
does provide private pid spaces ( by putting <pid,container> tuple into
the same pid ). Yes, privacy is achieved only by guarding the edges, but
the next approach that was discussed on the mailing list was to indeed 
make container's first class object, hang the pid mgmt and pid lookup
off the container and thus force the isolation.
Containers then hence move up to be children of "init".

Could you spell out what specific UNIX semantics you are referring to.
That would help and we can discuss whether and how they can be
addressed.
