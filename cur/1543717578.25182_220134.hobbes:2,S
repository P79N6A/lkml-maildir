It's removed because Peter seems to not want to support it any more, and 
there didn't seem to be any usage. But if people out there are actually 
using it, and somebody wants to support it _and_ it is in good working 
state for 2.6.x, we could certainly bring it back to life.
But if you only do this because you want to fix warnings that people have 
posted about the sources, and you're not actually seriously using it and 
maintaining it, then I'll just apply this patch against plain 2.6.6 (so 
that it doesn't go away if somebody wants to resurrect it later).
In other words - holler if you want to seriously support it. We're not 
deleting it to be spiteful..
