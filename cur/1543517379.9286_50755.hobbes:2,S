	A speculative read is never "thrown away" if it's needed. It's only thrown
away if it's not executed (say, due to a conditional branch instruction).

	Correct, the read isn't retired, but the value read earlier is the value
that will be retired when the retire takes place.

	The read is never redone. How would the processor possibly know to redo the
read? And why would it? Are you suggesting that every speculative read be
redone if any chunk of memory is written to by any processor?
