I often get these, too. My FIN_WAIT1 connections usually have a Send-Q
of 24 and cannot be removed. My CLOSE_WAIT connections stay up fairly
long...:

$ grep "local hangup" /var/log/messages | tail -n 1

$ netstat -n | grep tcp
tcp        1      0 129.70.36.61:1543       129.70.4.13:8080       
CLOSE_WAIT
... but can be removed by loading the line again. 129.70.4.13 is a http
proxy running FreeBSD, AFAIK. I don't get CLOSE_WAIT states for long
enough to be seen in netstat when accessing a local (w.r.t. the
129.70.0.0/16 net) web server running linux directly.
Just like to have some answer from sombody who knows whether this is
normal behaviour or not. HW is like the previous poster, but kernels are
2.2.1[0-4].
TIA,
Marc
