Uhm, not sure who to send this too...
I thought I'd try out the realtime patch set and it didn't work at all
with kvm. The console didn't dump anything and the system completely
locked up.
Anyone have any suggestions as to how to get more output on this issue?
It got to the point of bringing up the tap interface and attaching it
to the bridge but that was about it for the console messages.
Thanks,
