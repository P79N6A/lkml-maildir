Hmm, maybe make it an own driver that creates the sysfs entries somewhere.
I don't think it's useful enough for the main kernel.
But what happens during power saving that may lower the frequency? 
Wouldn't you need update events for that? That might complicate it.

Yes.

Yes, but you usually don't need the frequency.
