On closer examination, indeed, this cannot happen.  I was presuming an
order dependence when there wasn't one. I am now older and wiser: 
although I had to write my own patch to become that. 
I beleive there's still an off-by-one error:
Presume list contains
  maj=x, minor=0-64  (and nothing else)
Go to add
  maj=x, minor=64-127
The conditions to break out of the for-loop are never met, so
the loop terminates naturally, with *cp null, (or with a higher 
major number), and the new interval is added when it should not 
have been.
I beleive the patch below avoids this.  Perhaps it might be 
easier to understand? I have not run your test harness on it.
