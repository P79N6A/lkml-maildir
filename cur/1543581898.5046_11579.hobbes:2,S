This is getting off-topic, but I was wondering - does the pc110 pad driver
still work? I seem to recall trying it around 2.2.9 or so, and eventually
giving up. (Not that it's vital or anything, but I have three of the
little things lying around here that I keep on telling myself I'm going to
use one day...)
And while we're on the topic, toy.cabi.net is still listed in
Configure.help as the location for the pc110 pad driver docs, but it
doesn't resolve for me...
