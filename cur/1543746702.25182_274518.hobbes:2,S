That's good.

Try this first.
1. Open drivers/video/matrox/matrofb_accel.c
2. At the end of the file is this function:
static void matroxfb_imageblit(struct fb_info* info, const struct fb_image* image) {
	MINFO_FROM_INFO(info);
	DBG_HEAVY(__FUNCTION__);
	if (image->depth == 1) {
		u_int32_t fgx, bgx;
		fgx = ((u_int32_t*)info->pseudo_palette)[image->fg_color];
		bgx = ((u_int32_t*)info->pseudo_palette)[image->bg_color];
		matroxfb_1bpp_imageblit(PMINFO fgx, bgx, image->data, image->width, image->height, image->dy, image->dx);
	} else {
		/* Danger! image->depth is useless: logo painting code always
		   passes framebuffer color depth here, although logo data are
		   always 8bpp and info->pseudo_palette is changed to contain
		   logo palette to be used (but only for true/direct-color... sic...).
		   So do it completely in software... */
		cfb_imageblit(info, image);
	}
}
3. Replace the above function to use software drawing so it becomes like this:
static void matroxfb_imageblit(struct fb_info* info, const struct fb_image* image) {
	cfb_imageblit(info, image);
}
