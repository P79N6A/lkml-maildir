I think your referring to the term "SoC (system-on-chip)" is confusing
(at least for me). You rather consider companion chips than SoCs.
Yes, any chip integrating a number of controllers could be considered
as a system-on-chip but if the chip doesn't make sense without
some master chip (processor) I'd consider the chip as a companion
(to the processor) chip.

Dmitry
