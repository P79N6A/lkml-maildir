the issue with this currently is that the resolver is not using a new 
"Transaction ID" in the DNS porttion of the packet.  This is the one 
unique piece of informatino that helps distinguish what query belongs 
to what response (since same source port and ip is used).  So if the 
transaction id in the DNS header of the query is not updated, there is 
no real way to distinguish these dns requests.  Also keep in mind the 
linux box is requesting the same A record, so even that is not unique 
among these requests.
I am trying to figure out why the resolver (redhat 8 glibc) is behaing 
this way, b/c it is breaking applications.  If it simply updated its 
transaction ID in the packet i dont think this would be an issue.
thanks
