Nice, this can be done on non-hotplug motherboards as well?
How much time does it take to take the cpu up again?
It would need to be awakened whenever the activity increases
again, and that delay should not be too long.
Also, what effect does this have on cpu power consumtion
and thermal output? Does it lower it below normal idle?
