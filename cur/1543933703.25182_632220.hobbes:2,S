And? The rationale for this patch seems to be incomplete.
As far as I can figure out you're replacing an optimized percpu 
implementation which a dumber generic one. Which needs
at least some description why.
If the generic one is now as good or better than the 
specific one that might be ok, but that should be somewhere
in the description.
Also for such changes .text size comparisons before/after
are a good idea.
