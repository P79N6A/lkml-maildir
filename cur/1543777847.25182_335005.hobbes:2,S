Yes.

You have the same problem with regular files. This is a user and not a 
kernel problem.

I disagree. Where is the information value of i_size if we always could 
return 0? IMO it should be at least an upper bound for the "number" of 
informations that could actually be read (in terms of a seek offset) 
like it is in the case of regular files. Better, if it is a strict upper 
bound so that you can seek to every value smaller than i_size. For this 
purpose the i_size of directories doesn't need to reflect any unit.
