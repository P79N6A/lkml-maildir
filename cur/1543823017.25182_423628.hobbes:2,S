The only question is: does it make the code better?  The code has
seven printk/return combinations.  Each of them would chew up 2 more
lines without the macro.  So phram_setup would grow from 44 to 58
lines, not nice either.
What bugs me more is the hidden allocation in parse_name.  Looks like
that should return a pointer or ERR_PTR(foo), not an int.
