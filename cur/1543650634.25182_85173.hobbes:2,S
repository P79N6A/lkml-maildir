Subject: [2.4] [PATCH] Make reiserfs to refuse mounting of non 4K blocksize filesystems
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello!
   There seems to be some confusion going on among the users who try
   to use non-standard blocksize reiserfs filesystems with 2.4 kernels
   (where this support is not yet merged) and are able to easily crash
   kernel this way, so it seems following patch is necessary for now,
   that only allows to mount 4K-blocksize reiserfs filesystems.
   Please apply.
   Thank you.
Bye,
    Oleg
