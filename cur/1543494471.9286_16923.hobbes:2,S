  Hi, all. Version 98 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.2.7. Highlights of this release:
- Don't unregister already unregistered entries in <unregister>
- Register entry in <sd_detect>
- Unregister entry in <sd_detach>
- Changed to <devfs_*register_chrdev> in drivers/char/tty_io.c
- Ported to kernel 2.2.7
				Regards,
					Richard....
