I tried this as well a few years ago, and I think I hit a few places in
the early initialization, but nothing unfixable.

How about the opposite? We could have a raw_spin_lock_irq() in places where
there are valid uses of spin_lock_irq() with irqs disabled and the same
for spin_unlock_irq with interrupts already enabled.
I can try to come up with a new implementation, including some rate-limiting,
which I think my first attempt was missing.
