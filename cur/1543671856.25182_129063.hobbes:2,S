   Its got big again, so I've put it here, if you'd like it in bits rather than
   all one lump, just shout:
Please do this because it's easier for me to evaluate small patches
doing one thing at a time and you're also making modifications to
things outside of decnet.
About update_pmtu().  You are not required to implement this.
All of these places you see dereferencing dst->update_mtu()
know that they have an ipv4/ipv6 route.  Or do you know some
exception to this?
