The place this probably matters most is in various function calls. For
example, given the following prototype, (and ignoring the fact that
gcc is generally able to properly compile all of these), which is the
most clear?  These are all "logically" correct, for the most part, but
as humans we have certain readability standards.
int some_function(int a, void *b, char *c, unsigned char d, int e);
A)	int res = some_function(0,0,0,0,0);
B)	int res = some_function(NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);
C)	int res = some_function(0,NULL,NULL,'\0',0);
C is the most expressive of the intent of the code, and the least
likely to contain bugs.
