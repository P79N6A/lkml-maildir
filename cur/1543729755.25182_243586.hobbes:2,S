Joshua, give the attached patch a try.  I know it's huge, but
I've been meaning to make these improvements for a long time
on sparc64 and this bug gave me a good reason to just do it.
:-)
It should definitely fix the busybox mount() problem.
The fork() problem probably not, please try to trace
into the forked() process.  If that proves too hard
get back to me and I'll try to cons up some debugging
hacks for the kernel to try and track that one down
too.
Thanks.
