Subject: [patch 0/2] PNP: disable PNP motherboard resources that overlap PCI BARs

The following two patches fix several problems caused by BIOSes that
report PNP motherboard device resources that overlap with PCI BARs.
I think these should go in before 2.6.25 because some of these problems
showed up in 2.6.24 when we increased PNP_MAX_MEM from 4 to 12, and
there's no good way to work around them.
