Why?
Bugs that result in Oops in core code (class.c) can bite
just about any subsystem that does hotplug, and should get
prompt attention.  Or so one might think.
* * * *
Patch reproduced below for full CC:
While doing insert/remove (quickly) tests on USB, I managed to trigger
an Oops on 2.6.23.1 on the call to strlen() in make_class_name().
This patch prevents the oops, but still keeps the bug visible.
There is still the larger problem of the overall race
that caused this in the first place, but much of the rest
of the code in class.c appears to also do NULL checks to
avoid Oops'ing, so this continues the tradition.

Patch applies to both 2.6.24 and 2.6.23.
