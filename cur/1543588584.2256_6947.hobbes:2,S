I tried it with about a half-dozen nested and no problem. Mandrake
cooker here...
uname -a
Linux lion 2.4.3-ac11 #5 SMP Fri Apr 20 22:10:41 EDT 2001 i686 unknown
gcc --version 
2.96
ls -l /lib/libc-*

/lib/libc-2.2.2.so
su --version
su (GNU sh-utils) 2.0
I don't think libc is the problem, unless it is in conjunction with the
compiler choice. Have you tried building the kernel with the updated Red
Hat gcc version? I know Mandrake has kept theirs current to Red Hat and
it works fine for me.
