SMART should just start working.  It adds the ioctls that existing smartd
and hdparm already know about.
The two reasons why passthru is not upstream are:
* I need to make sure that it is 100% up-to-date for the latest ATA
passthru spec, which clarified some SCSI CDB and descriptor codes.
* There was at least one report of ATA passthru use causing a device
under load to start timing out, which could possibly indicate a driver
bug.  I need to do a serious analysis and final review of the patch, to
make sure that it is plugged into the ATA host state machine at the
correct places.
