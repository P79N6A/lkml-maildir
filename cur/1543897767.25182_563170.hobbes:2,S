__extension__ should be macroized if so.
However, since something that doesn't have "long long" won't be able to 
compile those headers, there is absolutely no reason to not simply use 
it -- you get an error message on that line, which is good enough. 
There is definitely no reason to use a test like the one above, which is 
wrong for several supportable compilers.
