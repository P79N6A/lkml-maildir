... broke NPTL.  Tests which worked with previous kernels fail now.  One
test eventually succeeded, but the process somehow got stuck for about
30-40 seconds.  Then it finished.  Running strace showed a call to
clone() as the last operation but there were other threads running at
that time.
I tried to login (via ssh) into the system when the process hang and
this, too, was delayed and succeeded immediately when the strace'd
process continued.
I haven't looked at the changes made and wouldn't expect to understand
all the details either.  And I can understand if you don't want to run
the glibc test suite.  What I can offer are statically linked versions
of the tests.  One is here:

Let me know if you need more help.
