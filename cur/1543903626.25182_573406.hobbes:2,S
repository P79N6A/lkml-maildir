The Coverity checker spotted the following use-after-free
in drivers/xen/xenbus/xenbus_xs.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
static int process_msg(void)
{
...
                if (IS_ERR(msg->u.watch.vec)) {
                        kfree(msg);
                        err = PTR_ERR(msg->u.watch.vec);
...
<--  snip  -->
