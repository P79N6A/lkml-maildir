having preemption support that 1) is correct 2) works?
We *must* use the schedule() check to debug preemption bugs, or we wont
have usable preemption in 2.6, i dont really understand why your are not
happy that we have such a great tool. In fact we should also add other
debugging bits, like 'check for !0 preemption count in smp_processor_id()'
, and the underflow checks that caught the IDE bug. These are all bits
that help the elimination of preemption bugs which are also often SMP
bugs, on plain UP boxes.
