If the list is really empty during a normal exit, does it hurt to call
the helper?  The whole goto inside of an if(0) statement looks a little
funky.
The following would be the same number of lines of code, and this is
used pretty commonly in the kernel:
	return err;
clean_pages_up:
	readpages_cleanup_helper(pages);
	return err;
But, I really wonder what is wrong with this:
clean_pages_up:
	readpages_cleanup_helper(pages);
	return err;
