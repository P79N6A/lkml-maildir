with the 2.6.22-rc4 kernel that I was useing earlier, adding these two 
options clears up the problem. Thanks.
should I test the two individually? or just plan on useing both from now

I normally disable PnP (both ISA and PCI), should I leave it enabled with 
the newer kernels and this motherboard?

for ease of testing (I got time to reboot the box around midnight) I used 
the same config as before, so this is still on.
