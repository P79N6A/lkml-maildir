Some more information: 
* Update to 2.6.4-rc1 doesn't help, same situation as before.
* 2.4.25 finds/uses int 18
* Binary search shows that the problem first appears with 2.6.2-bk1; 2.6.2 works OK.
Further search shows that it's the e1000 driver update from 5.2.20 to 5.2.30.1 that breaks things for me. copying the older driver into a newer kernel works.
Hmm, changelog states what looks like a possible candidate: 
*   o Use pdev->irq rather than netdev->irq in preparation for MSI support.
Final information:
Backing out the pdev->irq <-> netdev->irq changes gives me ifconfig output with the correct interrupt listed; unfortunately, 
	ifconfig eth0 up 
still locks the machine, so that doesn't seem to be the only problem.
Bye, Martin
