We'd really need to see that final oops trace, please.
It's not unusual for a hard-working gigabit NIC to exhaust the page
allocator reserves and perhaps we're a bit too noisy in the logs when it
happens.  But it's sufficiently rare and sufficiently associated with other
problems (like this one) that nobody has yet gone and stuck the
__GFP_NOWARN into the relevant drivers to suppress the messages.
If we really have broken something in there then someone else will hit this
soon enough.  But nobody has, as far as I know.
A digital photo of the screen would suit.
Or perhaps netconsole.  If the crash is really associated with the NIC
running out of txbufs then netconsole might not be useful.  But perhaps the
crash is something else altogether.
Netconsole is pretty easy to get going.  See
Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt.  To the target machine's kernel
boot command line you add
netconsole=4444@a.b.c.d/eth0,5140@A.B.C.D/nn:nn:nn:nn:nn:nn
where a.b.c.d is the target machine's IP address and A.B.C.D is your
workstation's IP address and nn:nn:nn:nn:nn:nn is your workstation's MAC
address.
On the workstation, do
	netcat -u -l -p 5140
