Hi,
Downloaded linux 2.2.0 and tried to compile it... most of it compiles ok,
but stops at checksum.c. A symbol (csum_partial_copy) is already defined.
I had the same problem with the 2.2.0-pre9. (that is the same). I checked
the 2.2.0-ac1 patch but there was nothing regarding this.
How can I solve this problem?
cheers
Kledi
