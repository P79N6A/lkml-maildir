Yeah, I tried that and it didn't work.  Then I did a google search for the
error, and found that I have to set root's limits to unlimited, because for
some reason or another, they got messed up.  Now everything is working, I just
have to run 'unlimit filesize' whenever I want to format a partition or
anything.  Not sure what messed it up, but this is fine for now ;p
