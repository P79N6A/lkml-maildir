If you'd had a machine stolen, and seen it show up somewhere else where you
couldn't prove it was yours you wouldn't be so cavalier about this stuff.
Stolen computers are a problem.  Hell, even between departments at the same
company it can be a problem.
As for serial number registration, I'll stick to a safe deposit box or my
own fire safe.  
I'm not asking for anything but the CHOICE in a mainstream kernel to be able
to turn on the serial number for my own purposes, which right now would be
equipment tracking.  I have no other use for the serial number outside of
that.  
I'm not asking you to play along and let your machine do this.  I want it to
default to off.  I want you to have to recompile your kernel to do it.  And
even then, I only want it to be stored on a hard drive if you explicitly set
up a switch in lilo or something to do that.  Is that enough for you?
