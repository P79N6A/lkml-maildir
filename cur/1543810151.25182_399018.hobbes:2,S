Today, I had the *exact* same problem on one server equipped with the same
card. I tried the patch above which did not change anything. However, I
finally fixed it by simply enabling ACPI. Then it always works with and
without the patch above. I could not test marvell's driver because it does
not build on 2.6.16-rc4, but strangely my previous kernel on this machine
was a 2.6.12-rc4-mm2 patched with marvell's driver and with ACPI disabled.
So it seems that marvell's driver on 2.6.12 was able to access config space
even without ACPI while sky2 on 2.6.16-rc4 cannot. I have no idea why,
unfortunately.
Just my 2 cents,
Willy
