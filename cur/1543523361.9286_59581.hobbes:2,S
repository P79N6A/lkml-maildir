I didnt see the original post. Don't know about which kernel this is.
The "Wrong buffer length supplied" message is a bug in the code -
not a problem. In my never-submitted aha1542.c I removed this message,
or put #if 0 ... #endif around it, or so. Maybe this was fixed in 2.3.*,
so the above report may be about some older driver, or perhaps not
about the aha1542. Anyway - almost certainly nothing is wrong here,
except that this message shouldnt have been printed.
