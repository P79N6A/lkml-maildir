This is wrong. There is nothing that guarantees that the read has read the 
high bits first. 
It might have read the low bits first (and gotten 0xffffffff), and then on
another CPU the contents were updated, and now the high bits are one
bigger, and when you read the high bits, you get a value that is off by a
_lot_.
And it's not just 0 and 0xffffffff in the low bits that can be problematic 
either: if the CPU that does the "get_jiffies64()" gets an interrupt, the 
thing may be off by more than a count of one.
IF this optimization is really worth it, the code should be something like 
this:
	#define JIFFY_SLOP (3)
	u64 ret = jiffies_64;
	u32 low32 = ret;
	if ((low+JIFFY_SLOP) <= JIFFY_SLOP*2) {
		... do the seqlock thing ...
	}
instead.
Which still avoids the read-lock about 99.9999% of the time, so it may 
well be worth it. But somebody should double-check my logic.
