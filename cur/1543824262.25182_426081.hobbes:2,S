Unless I'm misunderstanding this issue, no official glibc release was 
ever affected which makes the probability of other people being affected 
pretty small.
And this issue is about backwards compatibility only insofar, that it 
works around a bug in some ancient cvs versions of glibc.
Is it a new policy that the kernel mustn't break any buggy userspace 
code?
