Oh, the horror!  ;-)

Actually, I would hope that a large development environment where
users are given fine-grained control over their resource usage would
1) allow interested tasks to register for notification before a
resource is taken away, and 2) that this system of registration and
notification is implemented in userspace.  Use d-bus or something.

Okay.  Consider the case where a task's cpuset consists only of threads
or cores that share cache.  Keeping the task in its cpuset when
offlining due to cache errors is exactly the wrong thing to do.
Anyway, it looks to me like task->cpus_allowed should already reflect
task's cpuset (cpuset.c:attach_task calls sched.c:set_cpus_allowed),
so now I'm missing the point of the patch.
