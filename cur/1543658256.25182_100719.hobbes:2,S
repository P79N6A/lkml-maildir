The numbers I got are taking into account packet drops. I think that the 
point where performance starts to go down is when an interface is dropping 
more than a couple hundred packets per second (at least in my testing). In 
my testing scenario, traffic is perfectly distributed across interfaces 
and I have bound the irqs using smp_affinity. Unfortunately, the 
performance gain is small if any.

Another problem you may have is that irq_balance is random, and sometimes 
more 
than one interrupt is serviced by the same cpu at the same.  Actually, let 
me 
clarify.  In your case if your netowrk load was "even" across the 
adapters, 
ideally you would want cpu0 handling the first 4 adapters and cpu1 
handling 
the last 4 adapters.  With irq_balance, this is usually not the case. 
There 
will be times where one cpu is doing more work than the other, possibly 
becomming a bottleneck. 
Now, there was some code in SuSE's kernel (SuSE 8.0, 2.4.18) which did a 
round 
robin static assingment of interrupt to cpu.  In your case, all even 
interrupt numbers would go to cpu0 and all odd interrupt numbers would go 
to 
cpu1.  Since you have exactly 4 adapters in even interrupts and 4 on odd 
interrupts, that would work perfectly.  Now, that doesn't mean there is 
some 
other problem, like PCI bandwidth, but it's a start.  Also, you might be 
able 
to emulate this with irq affinity (/proc/irq/<num>/smp_affnity) but last 
time 
I tried it on P4, it didn't work at all -No interrupts!
