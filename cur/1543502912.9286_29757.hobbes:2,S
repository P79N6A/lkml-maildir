I wonder if your hard disk wasn't put into sleep...
I saw this once on a mother board that aparently had a broken apm
configuration, The second master hard disk was simply always put into
sleep, even if it was just accessed, and it wasn't true only on linux,
but under windows as well, at least in the linux you culd user hdparm to
tell the hard disk not to sleep so often... :)
