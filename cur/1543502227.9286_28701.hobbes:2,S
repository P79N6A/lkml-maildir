Subject: 2.3.n: n>5; my usb mouse no longer works

simply stated, in 2.3.5, my usb logitech wheel mouse works perfectly.  i
cautiously ignored 2.3.6/2.3.7, didn't want to dive into 2.3.8 very much
and rejoined with 2.3.9...which promptly oopsed and made messes on the
floor.
2.3.9 and 2.3.10 fail to start up the usb mouse, announcing it's trying
to get a descriptor, then giving up.
without posting a *big* dump of all this usb stuff, is there a
maintainer of the usb code that has a utility for getting desired
information such as what usb hardware is involved, and does said
maintainer want this information?  it can really be a lot if y'know what
i mean. :)

Back to 2.3.5 where the grass is green and the kernels are pretty, take
me /home tonight...
