Based on the most recent discussion, e1000new (or whatever it will be 
called) should support only the newer PCI-Express chips, while e1000 
will retain support for the older chips.
Over the long term this will allow e1000new to grow without affecting 
support for the older, stable chips.
So, e1000 is not going away.
