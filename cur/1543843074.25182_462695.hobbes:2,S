It is similar to what ulimit generally implies.  It will definitely help
getting container code in mainline if we can minimize the changes in
mainline but still providing some meaningful functionality.
CKRM is excellent piece of code but I think its complexity is what
making it sit out side the mainline for such a long period of time.
