if this would be really true, then why do you use linux then? I don't
understand. I've to exclude the reason is that it's free and open.
I heard arguments like yours for years and years from tons of different
people, 7 years ago I heard the very same again and again about linux
at large compared to other operative systems (way before I was using
linux myself).
Personally I don't believe you. I'm not saying the vm is too complex,
but it's heavily dominatd by details, it's simply not possible to
unique describe the vm in terms of algorithms like most parers do, and I
believe what we have in linux (mainline 2.4.23pre5 and 2.6 [modulo
rmap]) is very optimal.
