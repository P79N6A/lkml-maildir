Are you sure gcc doesn't? Or is it just "C"?
Linux wouldn't work today if gcc did something non-atomic there
(presuming you're talking about naturally aligned pointers/ints).
It is widely used and accepted.
RCU users are far from the only places to rely on this, although
I guess they are the main ones when it comes to assigning pointers
atomically.
