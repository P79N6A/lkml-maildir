You must update vmnet with vmware-any-any-update93 patch
(
http://platan.vc.cvut.cz/ftp/pub/vmware
).  sk_alloc() function
changed type of its arguments, and unfortunately this causes only
compile-time warning, which you did not notice, but resulting module crashes
kernel as now mandatory argument is passed in as '0'.
You should report problems related to the VMware at the VMware community forums,
http://www.vmware.com/community/index.jspa.
  Most of peoples on LKML does not
care about these opensource modules.
