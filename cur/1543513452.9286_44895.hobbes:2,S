   Where could I find current status about PCI Modem drivers ?
If it is a true modem (i.e., one with a UART), then I am working on
adding support to the serial driver.  In order to do this, you need to
send me the output of "lspci -vv", and tell me exactly what the model of
the modem and who the manufacturer is.  
I won't guarantee that I can add support for your particular PCI serial
modem, but I will try....
