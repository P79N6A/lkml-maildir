The IDE layer assumes the power management layer doesn't generate
bogus repeated suspend requests. If it does then lots of drivers
are broken and the core code needs fixing.
If its because there are two different notifiers trying to park
the IDE disk that might make more sense.
However getting this wrong loses data so I will accept no changes to
this code until someone precisely explains what is going on so we
can be sure the fix itself is safe.
