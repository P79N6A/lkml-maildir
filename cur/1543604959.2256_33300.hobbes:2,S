Herewith I would like to announce that I have a dutch keyboard
configuration. As well as for X as for the console.
For more information see:
http://members1.chello.nl/~jorgen.best/
My goal is to get this keyboard integrated in the major Linux
distributions.
If possible I would appreciate if someone would inform me if you or
anybody
else are the right persons to inform about this small contribution. If I
should inform anyone else I would like to know who. Newsgroups did
respond that the console keyboard was a kernel issue all tough it's just
a configuration file.
If I send this mail accidentally to the wrong person, I'm very sorry to
bother you without reason.
Kind regards,
Jørgen Best[unhandled content-type:application/x-zip-compressed]
