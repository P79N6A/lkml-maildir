Oops, my fault. I was trying to build userspace part from the lm_sensors
tarball, and I did not remember that kernel modules will not build.
Anyways, docs say that you can set COMPILE_KERNEL:=0 in Makefile to build
just userspace, but I think it is outdated. You have to 'make user user_install'.
Variable COMPILE_KERNEL is not used anywhere.
And, after building userspace libsensors, my temperatures still read at 400 C:
