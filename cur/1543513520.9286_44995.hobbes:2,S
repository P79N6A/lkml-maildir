That's almost never the case.
For drivers that support many cards I usually have ten different
modifications outstanding, each one to attempt to fix a specific reported
problem.  Most changes either don't fix the problem, or are known to cause
other problems.  It's often a week or two before a test versions is
reported on, so many times there is no way to serialize the changes.
I usually have a extensively tested stable version, with "try this fix on
v0.91" branches, a tested semi-stable version, also with branches ("v0.91u
crashes?  See fi this hacked v0.91g-ppc version works"), and an barely-test
has-every-enhancement version.

50 times.

I always discount isolated reports.  How many times have you heard "the
older kernels didn't sig-11 with gcc".  I get "your latest driver version
stopped working" (when no version could have worked with their bad routes or
mis-paired cross-over cable).

During that time I annouce the updates to the driver mailing list, make many
test versions available, and test the driver myself.  I have well over 100
cards, and a handfull of machines.

And the driver code would never be cleaned up, or reworked because a new
chip changed things.

The "only add patches to the latest kernel" approach means that people have
to update to a usually-broken kernel to get a undated board revision to t
