quickly glanced this over since I recently disabled l1 ASPM for the e1000/e1000e
driven 82573 device which has issues with l1 ASPM. that immediately gives me the
question: how can I continue to disable 1l aspm by default for this device using
this infrastructure?
I do like the fact that there is a generic way to re-enable it for the users who
want to use it. Can this change be done when the device is already active? Can you
change this parameter per device/module?

might want to get rid of these bitfields?
