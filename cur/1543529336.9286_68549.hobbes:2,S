I am compiling cs4232 and the YM3812/OPL-3 driver into the
kernel.  I have specified the parameters for those drivers
in the lilo.conf file:
     append = "cs4232=0x530,5,1,0,0x300,10 opl3=0x388"
Note that these are the same settings I needed to have
my sound card work with the drivers as modules.  However,
now when I boot I get the following messages:
Mar 10 18:41:17 spot kernel: ad1848/cs4248 codec driver Copyright (C) by
Hannu Savolainen 1993-1996 
Mar 10 18:41:17 spot kernel: YM3812 and OPL-3 driver Copyright (C) by
Hannu Savolainen, Rob Hooft 1993-1996 
Mar 10 18:41:17 spot kernel: adlib: must specify I/O address. 
Mar 10 18:43:04 spot kernel: Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ
config error? 
I could try adding "adlib=<value>" but I don't know what the
value should be or why I need to specify it now, when I never
have in the past.
Thanks,
