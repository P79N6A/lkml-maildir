Actually, all the numbers are horribly bad on the ultra. I haven't run
lmbench for a while, and I see it was a mistake. The mmap is clearly very
bad, especially when 2.1.103 kernel on 167 MHz Ultra had mmap latency of
1505usec. I'll check what's going on. Anyway, we have a couple of new things
prepared for sparc64 for 2.3 once that gets opened, so the numbers might
actually get better again.
BTW: So that I have good comparisons, can you please send me full benchmark
numbers (best the results/ files) from your 450PII and ultra5/Solaris,
preferably using 
ftp://ftp.bitmover.com/lmbench/lmbench-2alpha11.tgz
 ?
Thanks.
Cheers,
