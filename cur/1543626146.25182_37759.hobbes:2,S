A kdev_t is conceptually a struct block_device *.
Points to allocated kernel space.
Writing such an animal to disk is completely pointless.
You want to apply some conversion function first,
even when that conversion function may be the identity
in the setup where a kdev_t has integral type. And make
sure that the resulting integer can hold at least 64 bits.
