Subject: [PATCH][TAKE 3] THE LINUX/I386 BOOT PROTOCOL - Breaking the 256 limit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Extending the kernel parameters to a user determined size
on boot protocol >=2.02 for i386 and x86_64 architectures.
Signed-off-by: Alon Bar-Lev <alon.barlev@gmail.com>

Hello,
Current implementation allows the kernel to receive up to 
255 characters from the bootloader.
In current environment, the command-line is used in order to 
specify many values, including suspend/resume, module 
arguments, splash, initramfs and more.
255 characters are not enough anymore.
This is take 3 of this submission:
Take 1 - Patch that allows command-line size to be 
determined in menuconfig. People did not want to see a new 
config option.
Take 2 - Removed the menuconfig into a fixed 2048 size. This 
patch was rejected. This is what the 2.6.11-rc2 changelog 
has to say about the matter:
 > Revert "x86_64/i386: increase command line size" patch
 > It's a bootup dependancy, you can't just increase it
 > randomly, and it breaks booting with LILO.
 > Pointed out by Janos Farkas and Adrian Bunk.
Take 3 (current) - Back to menuconfig option, so it won't 
break LILO (Although if it is broken because of this, it 
should be fixed...).
Please consider to merge.
If any of you think that this should be applied for other
architectures, please reply.
Current architectures that have 256 limit are:
alpha, cris, i386, m64k, mips, sh, sh64, sparc, sparc64,
x86_64, xtensa
Current architectures that have 512 values are:
frv(512), h8300(512), ia64(512), m32r(512), m68knommu(512),
mips(512), powerpc(512), v850(512)
Current architectures that are OK:
arm(1024), arm26(1024), parisc(1024)
Current strange ones:
s390(896) - I guess IBM has a good reason for this constant...
Best Regards,
Alon Bar-Lev
