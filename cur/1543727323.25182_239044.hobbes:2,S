actually, the way i understand the patch it is not that bad: normally
(in non-KCO mode) the fastpath locks/unlocks (uncontended locks) are
userspace-only. Non-KCO mode still gives all the priority guarantees. 
(There's also KCO mode for guaranteed-unlock-on-thread-death and for
broken architectures - but it doesnt have any real advantage other than
the slowdown.)
there's overhead in the wakeup handling and in the registration need for
non-KCO locks, but once things are up and running it should be quite
comparable to current futex costs - it's pure userspace.
so i think what would be nice is an extension of sys_futex() to
incorporate the fusyn primitives, and then a nice glibc patch to
introduce a robust mode for all the sync objects.
and if fusyn.c is fast enough then we could even try to do normal
futexes via fusyn.c - but not doing the registration/unregistration
(hence losing the priority guarantee, but still sharing much of the
codepath). This would be the most robust internal design i believe.
