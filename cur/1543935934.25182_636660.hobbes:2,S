So on Intel 9xx hardware we know how to flush the whole pipe from chip
to chipset to RAM, so when in the Intel
 driver we can leave pages mapped cached, and just flush all stages
before having the GPU access them,
This is only possible as long as we know all the parts involved, for
example on AMD we have problems with that
over-eager prefetching so for drivers on AMD chipsets we have to do
something else more than likely using change_page_attr.

Yes mainly we have used this scheme with Intel GARTs (also the only
driver we have done with the new GPU system) by working closely with
Intel engineers..
