Yuck.
The only conceivable reason for passing the mode as a separate parameter is
- To change the mode dynamically at run time.
- To share common code when the sequence is long and mostly shared
  between the various modes (as in open(2) or ll_rw_block()).
I sincerely hope neither of those apply in this case.
On the downside, it's more typing and uglier than a series of
frob_bit_nonatomic()
	(probably temporarily or permanently aliased to frob_bit())
frob_bit_atomic()
frob_bit_acquire()
frob_bit_release()
frob_bit_barrier()
functions, and those also prevent you from doing something silly like
frob_bit(x, y, O_DIRECT).  Also, the MODE_ prefix might be wanted by
something else.
