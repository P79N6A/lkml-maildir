Yeah, disable interrupts, and set a flag that the fake "sti" can test, and 
just return without doing anything.
(You may or may not also need to do extra work to Ack the hardware 
interrupt etc, which may be irq-controller specific. Once the CPU has 
accepted the interrupt, you may not be able to just leave it dangling)
But I was throwing that out as a long-term thing. I'm not claiming it's 
trivial, but it should be doable.
