I am not talking about bugs, I am simply talking about precise profiling
of the asm between two get_cycles_serialized(). Note, I always thought
from time zero that get_cycles_serialized() is not needed at all for
production code, but Tigran asked for an additional get_cycles() that
would take care of reordering issues and since it looked fun I implemented
it :).
