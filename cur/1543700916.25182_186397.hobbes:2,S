What kind of strange and misguided hw engineer did that?
I can understand a one-way L1, simply to keep the cycle time low, but 
what's the point of a one-way L2? Braindead external cache controller?

Does it keep fragmentation down?
That's the problem that Davem had in one of his cache-coloring patches: it
worked well enough if you had lots of memory, but it _totally_ broke down
when memory was low. You couldn't allocate higher-order pages at all after
a while because of the fragmented memory.
