Is it a edit problem or a directory-enter problem (i.e. can you do a "cd d"?).
Is it a general file access problem or only with vi (i.e. can do "echo bla >> file")
If it is a vi specific problem maybe the locking is the problem:
The insecure_locks on Linux server is  needed, cause Linux NFS Server will
serve lock requests normally only from root users, and True64 requests from
unpriveledged daemon user. This means fctnl locking cannot be done, and this
might be a problem for vi.
Otherwise check that lockd/statd is running on your server.
I dont know how to turn of locking in Tru64 vi (vim: set lock off) or Tru64
mount (linux: nolock).
