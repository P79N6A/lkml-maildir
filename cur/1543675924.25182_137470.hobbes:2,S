Hi !
	In the same thread : slight trouble with 2.5.70 / 2.4.19
Using 2.5.70 -> no problem
I've got to reboot twice to switch back to 2.4.19 or I loose my keyboard...
Regards,
Fabian

Objet : Weird keyboard with 2.4.20 (NEW!)
Hi!
I saw a problem with the keyboard and I want to tell my story.
Motherboards are EPOX with an Nvidia TNT2 card.
2 computers - not the same hard configuration.
From time to time the keyboard goes crazy: I press A it gives me z, I
press ENTER it gives me n and so on.
After a while or with a reset, the problem is gone.
What can this be?
Thanks!
