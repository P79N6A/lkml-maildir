I have a slightly different concern - the superio is a completely new
subsystem and it should be integtrated with the driver model
("superio" bus?). Right now it looks like it is reimplementing most of
the abstractions (device lists, driver lists, matching, probing).
Moving to driver model significatntly affects lifetime rules for the
objects, etc. etc. and will definitely not allow code such as above.
It would be nice it we get things right from the start.
