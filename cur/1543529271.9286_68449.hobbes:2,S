Subject: [2.3.51pre2] wrong shm_statfs in ipc/shm.c

Hi,
In ipc/shm.c we have:
static int            shm_statfs (struct super_block *, struct statfs *, int);
....
static struct super_operations shm_sops = {
        ...
        statfs:         shm_statfs,
        ...
};
But in include/linux/fs.h
struct super_operations {
     ...
        int (*statfs) (struct super_block *, struct statfs *);
     ...
};
It gives a compiler warning about wrong pointer assignment and
when running a number of applications fail with the following message
in /var/log/messages:
Mar 10 08:16:48 localhost kernel: shmget: shm filesystem not mounted
