I'd feel much safer if we only did this on chipsets where we know we 
have to do it.   Doing this for *every* Intel chipset ever made _will_
bite us.  There are some early chipsets (440BX era iirc) that would just
hang the box when you tried to read from various write-only registers.
But even on the chipsets where we _do_ need to save/restore something in
the upper part of the config space, surely it'd be a lot safer
to just save/restore what we need to rather than risk all sorts
of mayhem by writing to bits that may trigger hardware events.
