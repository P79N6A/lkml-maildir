64mb of space for 'disk' ?  You aren't compiling the kernel anyhow without
some serious mucking around.

And you think that trying to transport the kernel srcs + userland
will save you time in the long run?  If you have to physically move
your disk to initially put userland on, you can put on python too.  Or
go and run the 'freeze' schitt on it and have the C version.  What kind
of 'new' systems are you talking about?  I'm biased I guess since I'm
used to working on documented hardware.  So documents + time + good hw
debugger tend to help things along.

Because with the exception of your unique situation in which you have
a machine which is stable enough to compile a kernel on and develop
but can't run python, it's not a problem.
