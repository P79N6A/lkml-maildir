Subject: [PATCH] 2.4: BUG_ON (1/2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Marcelo and Alan,
The attached patch adds 2.5's BUG_ON construct to the 2.4 kernel.  This
is done to facilitate portability and back-porting 2.4 <=> 2.5, because
BUG_ON is a very readable construct, and because it is a small
optimization over standard BUG.
For the unaware,  BUG_ON(condition) is basically
	if (unlikely(condition) != 0) BUG();
There was some talk in one of Andrew's aa-vm threads over introducing 
BUG_ON in 2.4 - so I resend this patch.  There was also talk of a new
name (Jeff Garzik mentioned kassert).  This is fine, but since much of
the goal is portability between 2.4 and 2.5 the change needs to
subsequently be made in 2.5.  We can handle that later, if need be.
This patch is against 2.4.19-pre4, but also applies to 2.4.19-ac.  Alan
and Marcelo - please apply.
	Robert Love
