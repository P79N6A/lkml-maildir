Ingo, Neil:
Al has summarized that csum_partial() is arch-specific.
However, drivers/md/md.c uses it.
Does that mean that RAID volumes are not portable across
(some) architectures?
Should md.c use a specific, known, fixed (as in static,
arch-independent) version of csum_partial()?
Will changing now possibly make some existing volumes
non-portable?
Thanks,
