... and if you want to see something that's worse than either, check out 
/proc/ide/hda/identify.  Converting binary to hex doesn't aid in display 
in any shape, way, or form; all it does is make it impossible to use 
"dd" to do what I want, or from using my own hexdump tool.
Binary has a place, and "ASCII for ASCIIs sake" is just stupidity.
