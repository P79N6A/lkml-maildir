I have Jetway's J7F4K with the same CPU.

Without those options in the BIOS setup.

I don't have cx8, but I do have nx (which is unused because I have PAE 
disabled...).

Is it automatic? I have CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG=y without cx8 showing in 
cpuinfo, and it appears to work fine.
Will your changes needlessly prevent the kernel running? Would I be 
right in thinking that the kernel is successfully using cmpxchg even 
though it's considered disabled? I realise people compile kernels 
for the wrong CPU but preventing them working when it's been chosen 
correctly seems wrong.
