in fact, we had bugs on x86 where if userspace set up a specific value
for %ebx the kernel would crash, because the irq entry code was
incorrect. (this might even have been exploitable) So yes, if seccomp
would be backported to that kernel, seccomp would be vulnerable too.
but this is not what i meant, what i meant was this:

'provable' here means provable mathematically, as done in computer
science. Not 'provable via good track record'. So what i said was in
fact a compliment towards seccomp: i believe that as long as we assume
certain external mechanisms (the whole hardware environment, and all
irq/rest-of-kernel and read/write mechanisms) to be secure, the basic
seccomp code itself (those 100-200 lines of code), _may_ be provably
secure, mathematically. That would be a nice thing to have.
obviously the irq and sys_read/sys_write code is way too complex to be
mathematically provable in the near future.

sorry, but if an attacker can cause arbitrary signals to be sent to your
secure application (and the signals pass the security checks!) then you
have much bigger problems!
this is what i feel is unfair: you are (unintentionally, i presume)
mixing the security of the 'totality of ptrace APIs' with the security
model that 'untrusted bytecode' is in.

so your solution is to introduce a whole new API that duplicates much of
what ptrace can already do, with just about the same amount of risk? So
your solution is to leave UML out in the cold (and thus increasing risks
altogether), by having a crippled mechanism that UML could never use?
That i call a selfish NIH syndrome, not a security accomplishment.
but, i dont mind your code being in the kernel, for the reasons i
stated, as long as the anti-ptrace fallacy is clearly understood. So you
might have partly succeeded in social engineering your security feature
into the kernel (feel the irony?), but i'm trying to counter what i
believe to be false premises. Ptrace has its fundamental security
problems, but PTRACE_TRACE is not nearly as bad and should not be
confused with the kernel holes caused by other, security-independent
ptrace debug mechanisms.
