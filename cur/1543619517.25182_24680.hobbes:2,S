No.
The radix tree is basically O(1), because the maximum depth of a 7-bit
radix tree is just 5. The index is only a 32-bit number.
We could, in fact, make all page caches use a fixed-depth tree, which is
clearly O(1). But the radix tree is slightly faster and tends to use less
memory under common loads, so..
Remember: you must NOT ignore the constant part of a "O(x)" equation.
Hashes tend to be effectively O(1) under most loads, but they have cache
costs, and they have scalability costs that a radix tree doesn't have.
