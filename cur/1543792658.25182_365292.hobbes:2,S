The page is truncated/freed case is handled by migrate_pages(). The page 
is moved to the "moved" lists and then returned to the LRU. The functions 
putting a page back to the LRU will check the refcount and discard the 
page.

It could be empty but there could be new pages left over because some 
pages were freed before we could move them or we were unable to migrate a 
page and fell back to swap for a particular page. We need to free the 
leftover pages then.
