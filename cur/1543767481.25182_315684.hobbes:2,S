Subject: clock drift with two Promise Ultra133 TX2 (PDC 20269) cards

I'm running 2.6.11.8 on an server with two Promise Ultra133 TX2 (PDC20269)
PCI cards, same hardware revision (judging from stickers on the cards).
I'm using the CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_NEW driver.
Each card has two connected hard drives. Whenever I read from a disk
on one of the cards (e.g. using 'dd if=/dev/hdX of=/dev/null bs=1M'), and
at the same time read from a disk on the other card, there is heavy
software clock drift. It drifts about 2-5 seconds per minute.
This does not happen if I read from two drives connected on the same
card, or if I read from a drive connected to the motherboard IDE
(VIA vt8233a) and a drive on either of the Promise cards.
