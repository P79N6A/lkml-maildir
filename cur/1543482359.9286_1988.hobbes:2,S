Hello!
I installed a fresh Debian system with 2.0.34 and copied the linux kernel tarball off a cdr i made.  then compiled and everything was fine (network worked and so on) except for a problem with mounting cdrom's.  none of them work.  my fstab reads
/dev/hdc        /cdrom          iso9660 noauto                  0       1
i had a working cdrom in 2.2.0-pre1 but as soon as pre9 and 2.2.0 touched my system, nothing i try can make my /dev/hdc work.  hope someone can help.  please re: to mxk@russiamail.com.
Here is the error:
Script started on Tue Jan 26 12:10:47 1999
msk15:~# mount /cdrom
mount: block device /dev/hdc is write-protected, mounting read-only
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdc,
       or too many mounted file systems
msk15:~# mount /dev/hdc /cdrom 2>&1 
/*  at this point it hangs and i am forced to eject the cd out of the drive 
however, there are messages that script doesn't see for some reason (so i have to retype them in these comments).  they are descriptions of errors, i guess. some of them are:
isofs_read_super: user: root inode not initialized
eth0: Bus master arbitration failure, error 8cf2
why is the eth0 line there?  beats me.  but it looks like a serious problem.  the rest of the messages I assumed are just complaining about the tray being open and medium not found.
*/
/dev/hdc: Input/output error
mount: block device /dev/hdc is write-protected, mounting read-only
/dev/hdc: Input/output error
mount: No medium found

TIA,
