The x86 hardwares will only change the first 16bits. The rest bits
are unchanged. A simple test program can verify that.

It depends on what the initial value in the upper bits is. The
assembler in CVS generates the same binary code as
	movw %ds,(%eax)
for
	movl %ds,(%eax)
But the previous assemblers will generate
	66 8c 18   movw   %ds,(%eax)
for
	movw %ds,(%eax)
This bug has been fixed for a while. I guess that may be why Linux
kernel uses
	movl %ds,(%eax)
