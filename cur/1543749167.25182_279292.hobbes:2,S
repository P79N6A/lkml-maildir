In the function "ext2_read_inode" which reads the hard disk copy of inode into memory, I allocated memory to this pointer and filled the appropriate value. I chose this function as I thought when a file is opened, this function will be always called once. Upto this is working fine.

You are confusing "ext2_inode" (on disk structure, never change that) with
"ext2_inode_info" (in memory structure, what you want to change).
