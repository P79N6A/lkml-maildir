Dropping workarounds for egcs-1.1.2 doesn't mean that gcc-2.95.3+ or
gcc-2.96-x (x > whatever the infamed version nr was) will stop working.
Thus, there's a perfectly fine alternative to gcc3. gcc3 is too broken
to use on many platforms. Then again, it's the only alternative for
others... Sigh.
As long as gcc-2.95.3 is the recommended minimum version, I'm
happy.
