Subject: Entering BIOS on DELL mobiles - does the kernel prohibit?

Hi all,
first of all, if someone could point me to some information on that
topic, I would be glad. I didn't find anything on Google.
The 'problem' is: I remember being able to enter the DELL Inspiron BIOS
from a running X session (or console) some (long) time ago. I just noticed,
it no longer works. Does the kernel somehow prohibit to enter the BIOS
or does the laptop itself stop from doing so (maybe due to a BIOS update).
Thank you for any feedback,
       Marc
