I have it running with various 2.2 and 2.3,  with only minor hacking.
You may also need to increase the rather small symbol table limit in
scripts/genkdbsyms.awk (I was a bit surprised too that I run bigger
kernels than SGI ;);)
The main advantage of kdb over the usual kgdb stubs is that it is fully
SMP aware, can switch between CPUs etc. Now I only need a gdb remote-kdb.c 
that speaks kdb commands...
