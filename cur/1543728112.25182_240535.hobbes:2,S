i've uploaded the latest version of the voluntary-preempt patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.8-rc3-O5
-O5 fixes the APIC lockup issues. The bug was primarily caused by PCI
POST delays causing IRQ storms of level-triggered IRQ sources that were
hardirq-redirected. Also found some bugs in delayed-IRQ masking and
unmasking. SMP should thus work again too.
