Larger kernel PAGE_SIZE can work, still presenting 4KB page size to user
space for compat.  The interesting part is holding anon pages together,
not fragmenting to use PAGE_SIZE for each MMUPAGE_SIZE of user space.
I have patches against 2.4.6 and 2.4.7 which did that; but didn't keep
them up to date because there's a fair effort going through drivers
deciding which PAGE_s need to be MMUPAGE_s.  I intend to resurrect
that work against 2.5 later on (or sooner if there's interest).
