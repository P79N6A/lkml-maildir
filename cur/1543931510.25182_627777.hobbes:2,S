Well, FMR WRs wouldn't change the eHCA issue -- the driver would have to 
make an hCall in any case, and the architecture says that the hCalls used 
in this scenario might return H_LONG_BUSY, causing the driver to sleep. No 
way around that. Because of this, eHCA's FMRs are actually standard MRs 
with a different API.
If, as Or said, the iSCSI initiator issues commands in sleepable context 
anyway, nothing would be lost by using standard MRs as a fallback solution 
if FMRs aren't available, would it?
