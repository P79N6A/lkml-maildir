Thinking a bit more independently of bus type, and with an eye toward's
2.5's s/pci_dev/device/ and s/pci_driver/driver/, would it be useful to
go ahead and codify the concept of PCI domains into a more generic
concept of bus tree numbers?  (or something along those lines)  That
would allow for a more general picture of the entire system's device
tree, across buses.
First sbus bus is tree-0, first PCI bus tree is tree-1, second PCI bus
tree is tree-2, ...
