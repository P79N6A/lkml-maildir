I also use a 4-way switch to switch keyboard, video and mouse, and
I've met this problem with it. The explanation is simple: multiway
switches come in two varieties, these being make-before-break and
break-before-make respectively, and for this application, it is VERY
important that break-before-make switches are used.
If, as appears to be the case with your box, make-before-break
switches have been used, then both the keyboard and mouse could get
reset when switching, depending on the precice signal levels on the
pins being switched from and to at each stage.
Best wishes from Riley.
