A FAQ. Nothing wrong about that.

All this output is rather nonsensical. Geometry does not exist, and
various pieces of software print various meaningless numbers.
It would be better if /proc/.../geometry were removed.
Every microsecond spent looking at its contents is wasted.

I think you incorrectly blame your problems on disk geometry.
But I don't know the actual cause.

Geometry does not influence addressing mode. Moreover, mke2fs is a user space
utility. You mention 2.4.21-rc3, and the ide code including this stuff
changes quite a lot from version to version. What happens under 2.4.N
for N=18,19,20? Both geometries given multiply out to 234372285 and
234374112 sectors, both below 234375000.
Does mke2fs actually ask for an access of sector 234441583?
What size does *fdisk think the disk has?
Can it be that this was an attempted 48-bit command?
(Sorry - no time to read 2.4.21-rc3.)
