The paragraph in question reads:
	IBM has extended key pieces of its middleware to the Linux platform, to
	help it thrive in corporate networks of servers. These include the AFS
	Enterprise File System, allowing users of IBM's AIX version of the Unix
	operating system to share files with Linux users.
Since the "AFS Enterprise File System" allows file sharing with AIX, I
took that to imply that AFS in this case meant AIX fs.  I didn't know
that Transarc is now owned by IBM though....
