Subject: [PATCH] Allow reading tainted flag as user
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The commit 34f5a39899f3f3e815da64f48ddb72942d86c366 restricted reading
of the tainted value. The attached patch changes this back to a
write-only check and restores the read behaviour of older versions.
