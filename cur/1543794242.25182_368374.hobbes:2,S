Yet another data point:
Under 2.6.8-2 (debain sarge kernel), the test does not cause a spin.
Instead, the file extension via pwrite does not allow the new pages to be usable by
remap_file_pages.
However, munmap/mmap are happy to use pages intoduces by the pwrite...
and happily writes more than 4GB.
