Another view of the situation may be - ramdisk used to be static but then
started to rely on buffer cache. Now it can no longer rely on buffer
cache. Therefore, shouldn't it go back to being static?
This is, of course, only because I don't understand how
do_generic_file_read() works. If anyone in the world does understand it
(and Linux page cache in general) then there should be a bit more traffic
(and patches with detailed explanations) on this thread... :)
Btw, why doesn't someone start writing "Linux Page/Buffer Cache Internals"
book like the "Linux VFS" or "NFSd" books that Neil Brown wrote:
