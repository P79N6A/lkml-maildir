I've tried some things, in the hope to find a solution: 2.4.23pre, some 
patches, but no good news. Only one thing, that may help, I hope, if i 
select HIGHMEM support 64GB, instead of 4GB, I have the same super 
slowness problem asap the kernel had started, but it's less severe and i 
can see without becoming old the fsck of mounted partition.
I tried also to play with high memory buffers on or off, but no change. 
I've read about some problem hanging around with some hardware driver 
not correctly using highmem, but the scsi on these machine is a 
sym53c896, and it's safe highmode written...
I read of problems selecting mp1.1 on bios setup under linux, but i do 
not manage to find any similar setup in bios. anyway, i upgraded to the 
last bios from hp.
any hint? any tactic you can suggest?
thanks in advance
