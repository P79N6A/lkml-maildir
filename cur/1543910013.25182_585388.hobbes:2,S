Hi Rusty,
 In profiling bootup time, we noticed something new appeared
on the graph at 
http://pjones.fedorapeople.org/bootchart-preinit.png
in the name of khvcd.
"wtf is this" was my first reaction.
Followed shortly by much headscratching after finding it's
created by drivers/char/hvc_console.c whose Kconfig yeilds..
config HVC_DRIVER
        bool
        help
          Users of pSeries machines that want to utilize the hvc console front-end
          module for their backend console driver should select this option.
Which is a little confusing for those of us not actually using a pSeries.
The above profile came from a x86 box.
A little more grepping around revealed that lguest select's HVC_DRIVER,
thus sneaking this config option into the build.
asides from the needed Kconfig clarification, is it necessary for khvcd
to run at all if the lguest module hasn't been loaded ?  Is it possible
we can somehow delay creation of the kthread ?
	Dave
