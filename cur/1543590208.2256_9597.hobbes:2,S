That's ACPI kicking in. The kernel you're using is quite old, and it
doesn't know about the BIOS e820 memory detection call. The kernel will
just use all memory, including memory that is also used by some ACPI
tables. When you press one of the magic buttons, the ACPI BIOS expects
the tables to be correct and jumps right into kernel code.

Try linux-2.2.19, it contains BIOS e820 support. If you don't want to
compile a kernel, check if Red Hat has RPMs available somewhere on
their site. If you really can't use that, use the boot option "mem=<1MB
less than the machine actually has>" (so that's mem=127M for an 128MB
machine).
