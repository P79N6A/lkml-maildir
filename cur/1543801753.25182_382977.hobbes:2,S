Nope, you are were not mistaken, I did make a comment in that thread
(

), but that thread had completely
slipped my mind, thank you for the reminder.

Thanks, I'll apply that (and raise the timeout somewhat, since 2min is
far from enough time for me to write down an entire Oops by hand -
wouldn't it be better if it simply spun in a loop until some magic key
(like enter, esc, break or something) is pressed? Then you have all
the time you might need).
I'll hopefully post a "first Oops" in a little while - stay tuned ;)
