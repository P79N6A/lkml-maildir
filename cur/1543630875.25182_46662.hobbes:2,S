Nope, partity updates still occur.  It's more expensive than in
non-degraded mode, but parity still gets updated.  If it wasn't, you
would not be able to write to a degraded array at all, as updating
parity is the only way that you can write to a block which maps to a
failed disk.  By using parity, we only ever fail requests if there are
two or more failed disks in the array.
Cheers,
 Stephen
