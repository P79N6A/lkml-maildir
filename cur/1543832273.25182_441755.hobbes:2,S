I would instead argue that the only way that the last put_task_struct()
is an unrelated high-priority task is if it manipulating an already-exited
task.  In particular, I believe that the sys_exit() path prohibits your
example of priority-boosting an already-exited task by removing the
exiting task from the various lists before doing the release_task()
on itself.
Please let me know what I am missing here!
