Yes, plenty of proprietary tools in that space...  This is something 
Big-Iron has needed to do for quite a while - if nothing else 
fault-tolerance requires migrating processes of dead or dying nodes.
More recently some of the gnu stuff has come up to speed - though, I 
must admit it has been a while since I looked...
For the gnu world, have a look at "mosix" - but again, groups.google.com 
and search for "process migration"...  I am sure there have been 
developments in the time since I last looked at it...  I satisfied my 
needs with gridengine as the least invasive way to deal with load 
balance of EDA tools without having to use $LSF.  My requirements at the 
time were - "can I get it running and use it in an hour...", So, I doubt 
it was the best or only choice...
The goal of most of the clustering libraries is that it is transparent 
to the tool, but flexlm causes trouble even if you don't do screwy 
things,  so  YMMV.  At this point I have exhausted my expertise on the 
subject :-).
