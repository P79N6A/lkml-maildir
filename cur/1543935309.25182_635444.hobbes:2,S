I modified Qemu and use it to observe how winxp does suspend/resume. So
far, I just get some data for s4 suspend. I did have some interesting
finding.
1. xp seems not save pci config space. Or it appears just save config
PCICMD.
2. the order winxp does looks like
	a. save config (PCICMD), put device to D3 (it appears only for ne2000
NIC)
	b. _PTS
	c. write mem to disk
	d. write ACPI PM1_control register, then system shutdown
3. xp write ACPI GBL_EN bit just after _PTS (for both S4/S5), don't know
why
Attached is the log winxp does s4 suspend, it only includes pci config
read/write and ACPI register read/write.
I managed to make xp enter S3, but fails, so can't get the data for S3
so far. Anybody has other ideas which need to verify winxp, pls let me
know.
Thanks,
Shaohua
