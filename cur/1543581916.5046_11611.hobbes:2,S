Oh! I didn't get your meaning before. I think I understand now. The
problem with this is that the tests for block writeability are not done on
a per-partition basis. They are done on a whole block device basis. see
fs/block_dev.c in block_read() and block_write(). The following test kills
us:
        if (blk_size[MAJOR(dev)])
                size = ((loff_t) blk_size[MAJOR(dev)][MINOR(dev)] <<
BLOCK_SIZE_BITS) >> blocksize_bits;
        else
                size = INT_MAX;
        while (count>0) {
                if (block >= size)
                        return written ? written : -ENOSPC;
