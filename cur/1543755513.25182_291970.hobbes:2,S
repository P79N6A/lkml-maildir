actually you don't. The presence of the nested function (technically,
the taking of the address of a nested function) marks the PT_GNU_STACK
field in the binary, not the runtime behavior. As such, paxtest does not
offer any real such choice in behavior. The binary needs stack
trampolines, just that in one case you don't use them.
