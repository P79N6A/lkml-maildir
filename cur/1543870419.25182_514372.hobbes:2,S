Oh boy, wasn't this thread supposed to focus the syslets/threadlets ... :)

I have a simple one based on coroutines and epoll. You need libpcl and 
coronet. Debian hs a package named libpcl1-dev for libpcl, otherwise:
http://www.xmailserver.org/libpcl.html
and 'configure --prefix=/usr && sudo make install'.
Coronet is here:
http://www.xmailserver.org/coronet-lib.html
here just 'configure && make'.
Inside the "test" directory there a simple loader named cnhttpload:
  cnhttpload -s HOST -n NCON [-p PORT (80)] [-r NREQS (1)] [-S STKSIZE (8192)]
             [-M MAXCONNS] [-t TMUPD (1000)] [-a NACTIVE] [-T TMSAMP (200)]
             [-h] URL ...
HOST      = Target host
PORT      = Target host port
NCON      = Number of connections to the server
NACTIVE   = Number of active (live) connections
STKSIZE   = Stack size for coroutines
NREQS     = Number of request done for each connection (better be 1 if 
            your server do not support keep-alive)
MAXCONNS  = Maximum number of total connections done to the server. If not 
            set, the test will continue forever (well, till a ^C)
TMUPD     = Millisec time of stats update
TMSAMP    = Millisec internal average-update time
URL       = Target doc (not http:// or host, just doc path)
So for the particular test my inbox was flooded with :), you'd use:
cnhttpload -s HOST -n 80000 -a 8000 -S 4096
