It is the sound chip (ie snd-intel8x0).  If I unload it after resume, 
everything's fine and dandy.  Moreover, if I unload it before suspend, the 
box wakes up with no problems (of course, I have to unload the other modules 
too, as I said before).
However, I think the problem is with the hardware, not with the driver: if the 
sound driver is unloaded before suspend and loaded again after resume, the 
box behaves as though it were loaded all the time (ie IRQ #5 goes mad).  Are 
there any boot options that may help get around this?
