Ok, Dmitry's patch fixed one problem, but that one just allows me to get 
further enough that I can now suspend and resume the machine again, but 
there's still something wrong with HCI/USB/Input layer. 
I do believe it's related to the previous problem, because it does end up 
being very _close_, and it's again that usb 5-1 disconnect that seems to 
trigger it (except now it's not at bootup, now it's at resume-time):

	kernel BUG at mm/slab.c:2688!
	...
(the actual OOPS message from the BUG_ON() is due to this one:
	BUG_ON(objp != index_to_obj(cachep, slabp, objnr));
but I think that's just due to the slab corruption that the redzone_free 
check already complained about, so I don't think the OOPS is very 
interesting).
Anyway, maybe it really is a hci_usb bug now, not an input layer thing, 
and it just happens close-by because device disconnect just in general is 
hard and nasty. The traceback certainly seems to point at hci_usb.
I'll see if this is repeatable (and whether it goes away without that 
hci_usb module).
