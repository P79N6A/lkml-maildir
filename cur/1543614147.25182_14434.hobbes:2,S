One possibility would be to release 2.4.17 and 2.4.18-pre1
simultaneously, with the otherwise last minute changes. There have
been so many brown-bag bugs introduced by the last changes, there
everyone is or should be nervous. Immediately launching the next -pre
series will help keep the momentum moving while preserving the more
certain knowledge of the quality of the last -rc level.
