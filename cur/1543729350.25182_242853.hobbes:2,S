-mm plus two patches I sent today works pretty much okay. Are they
swsusp-related things in your tree that are not in patrick's bk?
driver-tree changes (enums etc) are pretty much orthogonal and can go
in anytime later.

Works for me, some users reported success (after being advised to use
"shutdown" method), and suse pulled it into internal tree and it got
basic testing there by Stefan. I guess that counts like "pretty well
tested".
