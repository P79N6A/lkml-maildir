The Coverity checker spotted the following array overruns
in drivers/hwmon/lm93.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
struct lm93_data {
...
        struct {
                u8 min;
                u8 max;
        } temp_lim[3];
...
};
...
static void lm93_update_client_common(struct lm93_data *data,
                                      struct i2c_client *client)
{
...
        for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                data->temp_lim[i].min =
                        lm93_read_byte(client, LM93_REG_TEMP_MIN(i));
                data->temp_lim[i].max =
                        lm93_read_byte(client, LM93_REG_TEMP_MAX(i));
        }
...

       "Is there not promise of rain?" Ling Tan asked suddenly out
        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
