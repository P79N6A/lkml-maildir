In the last 5 weeks we've reduced our unresolved bug count
to 160 from 196 -- even as 50 new sightings rolled in:
 9/8/05:	739	Resolved	160	Unresolved	899	Total
 8/31/05:	733	Resolved	161	Unresolved	894	Total
 8/24/05:	721	Resolved	166	Unresolved	887	Total

<specific:->
We have a bugzilla category for battery issues.
There are 12 open, 4 of them resolved -- 3 of those
fixes are included in the proposed patch:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4892
through the ec_burst=1 fix is still optional:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3851
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3974
I think it makes sense to proceed to get broader
testing on the latest code.  We're not getting
new failure reports from -mm.
Indeed, I'd like to try enabling the new ec_burst=1
by default in -mm.  It is not perfect, but it works
for me, so it should do much better than the 2.6.13-rc3 attempt.
We'll keep ec_burst=0 as the default in Linus' tree
for now.  The systems that require ec_burst=1 will
have to supply it manually for now, which is better
than not having it all per 2.6.12.
thanks,
-Len
