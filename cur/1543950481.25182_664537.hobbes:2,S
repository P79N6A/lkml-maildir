Subject: [PATCH] Mark kobjects as unitialized

Hi greg,
When I remove only the kvm-intel module without removing the kvm module itself, I get an error saying that a kobject is 
trying to be reinitialized. Its because of the fact that kvm reuses a kobject in kvm_init when calling sysdev_register.
This patch fixes kobject_cleanup by marking the kobject as uninitialized when we cleanup to allow kobjects to be reused.
