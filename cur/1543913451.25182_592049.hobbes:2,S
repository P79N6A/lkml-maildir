man udev says:
| The name of the device matched while searching the devpath upwards
| for SUBSYSTEMS, KERNELS, DRIVERS and ATTRS.
What exactly does this mean?
Why should anyone need the name of a device, he didn't search for?
Could someone give me an example, where someone may be interested in an 
device name of an device, he just used, to narrow his rule to the one 
device, he is looking for.
Yours
Manuel
