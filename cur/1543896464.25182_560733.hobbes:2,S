That's how it is. When DOS was written, cpu relaxing like the HLT instruction
was not known yet (or was it?), so everything was (and still is) a busy loop.
(Yes, including today's typical x86 BIOSes. Aw crap!)
Of course there may be hacks that try to figure out if a DOS window is idle,
waiting for user input. (Seems like a new invention in Windows 2000 and up).
Since dosemu and all the emulators are not running a genuine Microsoft DOS /
have source, it should be easy game for them to wait non-busily. Or maybe
busy-waiting is _part_ of the emulation; maybe some DOS driver(s) require it.
