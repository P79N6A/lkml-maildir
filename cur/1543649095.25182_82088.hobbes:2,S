Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.44: lkcd (0/9): general description and diffstat
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/10/21/63

These are the latest LKCD patches for 2.5.44.  We have put in a
number of changes, additions and deletions requested by the
following people on the lkml list between our 2.5.38 and 2.5.44
patches:
	Randy Dunlap
	Andi Kleen
	Christoph Hellwig
	Kai Germaschewski
	Stephen Hemminger
We have tested again on multiple kernels with various types of
dumping devices.  The diffstat output is now at the top of each
patch.  These patches have been well tested.  Feel free to give
them a spin and let us know of any problems.
Thanks,
--Matt
