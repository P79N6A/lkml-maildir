You just have to read it in a way that says "partial results are
permissible, and are part of the normal behaviour". And then the fact that
when ^Z happens you get partial results from pipes is not "different
behaviour" from a qualitative standpoint - even though in fact we'd get a
full result if the ^Z didn't happen.
Put another way: ^Z does perturb the exact details of a read from a pipe, 
but it does not in any way change the _semantics_ of the read.
