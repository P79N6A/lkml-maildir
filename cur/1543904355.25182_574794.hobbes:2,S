Sorry, I headed slightly off-topic. Or perhaps 'up-topic' to the
larger issue, which is that the desktop experience has some suckiness
to it.
My point is that the page replacement algorithm has some choice as to
what to evict. The xorg input handler never should have been evicted.
It was hopefully a hard example of where the current page replacement
policy is falling flat on its face.
All that said, this could really easily be handled by xorg mlocking
the critical realtime stuff.

This one is not a scheduler issue, as mlock()ing the mouse handling
routines gives a smooth cursor. It's just a pure page replacement
problem, as the kernel should never have swapped that out in the first
place.
