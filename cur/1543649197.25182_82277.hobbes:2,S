IrDA devices are network devices. The core network code sends a RTM_NETLINK 
message when they go up or down. All is well, and once the permission fix 
gets into the kernel I'm using, my irda monitor applet no longer needs to 
poll the state of the interface.
But Bluetooth devices are not network devices, it seems. There exists no 
current mechanism for notifying anyone of state changes. Should we invent a 
new method of notification using netlink, or should Bluetooth interfaces in 
fact be normal network devices just like IrDA devices are?
