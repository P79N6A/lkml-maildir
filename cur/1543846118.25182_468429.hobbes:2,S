Let's be fair to gcc:
gcc correctly tells it "may be used uninitialized" - that's different 
from cases where gcc tells "is used uninitialized".
Sometimes, it requires _much_ context seeing that a condition is 
actually not possible.
And there are even cases where it's technically impossible for a 
compiler to figure out itself that a condition is not possible.
