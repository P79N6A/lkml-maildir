Patch functions OK for me (patch applied to 2.4.18-pre4) : I can enter 
and resume from APM with agpgart loaded.
Unfortunately, since moving from RedHat Rawhide 2.4.16-0.9 to vanilla 
2.4.18-pre4, I'm regularly confronted with the "ide_dmaproc : chipset 
supported ide_dma_lostirq func only : 13"-error when resuming from APM 
(see lkml-thread "DMA woes", 2001-12-07, with interventions from Andre 
Hedrick), but I verified this is unrelated to the presence of the 
agpgart module.
Sincerely,
Didier
