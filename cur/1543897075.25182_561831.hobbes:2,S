There is a real issue in the fact that compiling with -Os is available
through a kconfig option and AFAIR used by some distributions.
I doubt distros enable CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE due to size 
considerations, but due to speed considerations.
I wouldn't care if CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE was hidden behind
CONFIG_EMBEDDED, but as long as it's available as a general purpose
option we have to consider it's performance.
The interesting questions are:
Does -Os still sometimes generate faster code with gcc 4.2?
If yes, why?
