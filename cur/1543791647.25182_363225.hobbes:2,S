Finally got the relevant information from Intel. The embedded i486DX-2/4 
series does support CPUID, and PSE, and thus CR4. Ugh. Also just found 
this guy:
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo 
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 4
model           : 7
model name      : 486 DX/2-WB
stepping        : 0
fdiv_bug        : no
hlt_bug         : no
f00f_bug        : no
coma_bug        : no
fpu             : yes
fpu_exception   : yes
cpuid level     : 1
wp              : yes
flags           : fpu vme pse
bogomips        : 32.25
He won't like me too much. I'll write up a proper patch for this, a la 
mode de rdmsr_safe / wrmsr_safe. At least it's not a bug, just missing 
information.
