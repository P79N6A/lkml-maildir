I've written a simple app which checks if the framebuffer device is
correct installed. I do
it by more less just using the device. My little check app is working
but shouldn't there be a more correct way?
I'm also not sure what results are produced when the device exists but
without the right kernel module. How can I check for a kernel module to
inform the user about it?
