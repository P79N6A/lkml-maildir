Hi!
`subj` happened on my machine after doing little tortures. mem=12M,
bonnies, and without swap. Machine ran RAM out of ramand few processes
were killed, but I added swap and it seemed ok. However, at shutdown
time, `subj` appeared and I'm now fscking.
(Hw: pentium/233, IDE, believed to be stable).
