I can't say that it's happening here.  The time to untar
and sync a kernel tarball from /dev/sdb6 to /dev/sdb5:
2.4.19-pre4:
~/doit  6.55s user 3.69s system 53% cpu 19.225 total
2.4.19-pre7
~/doit  6.82s user 3.29s system 53% cpu 18.811 total
2.5.8:
~/doit  6.32s user 3.52s system 56% cpu 17.401 total
So 2.5.8 is a little quicker.  Note that this time includes
"sync".  2.4.19-recent has more intelligent write-behind
than other kernels, and if you don't include the /bin/sync
time, you actually miss out on timing a lot of the I/O.
Which is a good feature in 2.4, but it only goes so far.
dbench throughput is down the tubes in 2.5.8 - partly because
the kernel is starting too many pdflush threads, and partly
because I (had to) take out the bit of code where bdflush
waits on I/O completion before looking for another wakeup.
That would be a waste of pdflush resources.  It needs to
be addressed by other means, but not with the buffer LRUs.
