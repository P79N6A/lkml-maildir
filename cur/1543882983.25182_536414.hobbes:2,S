So I cooked up a changelog and queued up the diff.  But I have an uneasy
feeling that things are getting a bit close to guesswork here.
We have a huge amount of change pending in the kthread/workqueue/freezer
area, partly because I decided not to merge most of the workqueue changes
into 2.6.21.
It'd be good if people could take some time to sit down and re-review the
code which we presently have.  I plan on sending it all off for 2.6.22 and
there might be some glitches but it seems to have a good track record so
far.
