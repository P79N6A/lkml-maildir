I never said kernel should require glibc - it shouldn't (mind you I don't do 
kernelland headers). But kernel does duplicate each and every structure 
provided by glibc. It has to. The Bad Thing (tm) is that all (well... allmost 
all - lots of linux headers don't parse correctly in userspace) of those 
structures get exported to userland. And programmers use them. They don't 
include <sys/resource.h>, but <linux/resource.h>. And that causes conflicts 
(and is bad practice).

Parts of abi that are standardized 
(
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/
 - this thing; check the 
headers section), should be imho provided by C libs. These things do not 
change (they can't or everything would blow up) and I see no reason why glibc 
should rely on having additional headers available, just to do what it's 
supposed to.

Userland headers should be kept in /usr/include/{asm,linux}. I see no reason 
to change that (kernel headers have no business being in /usr/include btw). 
As to linux-common linux-kernelonly and linux-userland headers (linux-common 
used by both) - I just find it weird for userland to require kernel sources. 
Linux is supposed to have stable abi.

Additionall defines mostly. Probably some extra structures.
