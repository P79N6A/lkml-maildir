It is right because it stores %ebp before it is saved in the argument block
that ptrace can access.  That is the point of it.  %r9d has the value
loaded from (%rbp) just prior to this code, which is what %ebp should
reflect to match the i386 behavior.

This is also correct because RESTORE_REST has stored into %rbp the value in
the argument block, which ptrace may have modified.  This movl ensures that
this changed value is what the system call's argument will be.
The patch is tested and works.  Just try strace on a 32-bit program that
calls mmap2 and look at the 6th argument value.  It shows a stack address
without this patch.  With this patch, it shows the argument value the same
as strace on a native i386 kernel does.
Thanks,
Roland
