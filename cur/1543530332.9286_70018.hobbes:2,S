This is not strictly true; see below.

It depends on if you set /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory. The default state
has malloc() return 0 if your program asks for more than the TOTAL amount
of virtual memory (RAM+swap) on the machine. If you do "echo 1 >
/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory" then you can successfully malloc()
arbitrarily large memory regions.
[dwhysong@eleanor dwhysong]$ cat test.c
int main() {
        char *a;
        a = (char *) malloc(1024*1024*800);
	printf("%p\n",a);
}
[dwhysong@eleanor dwhysong]$ gcc test.c -o test
[dwhysong@eleanor dwhysong]$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        258352     125396     132956      50008      23152      26020

But the program runs and exits almost instantly, because it hasn't touched
the malloc()'ed memory:
[dwhysong@eleanor dwhysong]$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        258352     125400     132952      50008      23152      26020
-/+ buffers/cache:      76228     182124
Swap:       386460       3500     382960
Nothing was swapped out... why? Because the program never actually touches
any of the 800 megabytes it allocates, so no page faults are generated for
this memory and the kernel never actually has to come up with the free
data pages for the process.
However, this works as expected:
[dwhysong@eleanor dwhysong]$ cat freemem.c
int main() {
        char *a;
        unsigned i;
        a = (char *) malloc(1024*1024*250);
        for (i=0; i<1024*1024*250; i+=4096) a[i]=0;
}
[dwhysong@eleanor dwhysong]$ gcc freemem.c -o freemem
[dwhysong@eleanor dwhysong]$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        258352     200292      58060      17780     101116      16308
-/+ buffers/cache:      82868     175484
Swap:       386460       3596     382864
[dwhysong@eleanor dwhysong]$ ./freemem 
[dwhysong@eleanor dwhysong]$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
