Hello, I'm using -ck since... along time ago (I start using it with the
kernel 2.6.16) . I started using it with Ubuntu and  the response of the
system  was better. Since that I always compile my kernels with -ck.
Actually I use 2.6.20-ck1 and I have no problems, even with things that
needs kernel-sources like gspca for my webcam.
Thanks a lot for the patches. 
PS: when will this go into the official kernel?
