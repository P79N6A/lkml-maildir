Subject: ATA-6 Draft Proposal Changes for "vender-unique".

Upon a more exact definintion, I will request a formal NCITS number.
1) All devices shall reject all vender-specific commands when the
vender-unique enable is not set.  In addition enabling any vender-specific
commands shall not be done by anyone but the vender of the product.
2) The HOST portion of the reporting-logs will be defined as a a record to
record the time and date of these vender-unique enable calls.  This will
be a write only and shall not earasable by any means.  In addition the
vender shall provide a signature the authenticates the approved access,
and all other accesses may optionally provide a signature.
Because of the lack in clarity and the rule that which (paraphrased)
states: That which is not in the standard is not part of the standard.
This has cause me grief and lack of sleep making some decision seem less
than rational.
Respectfully,
Andre Hedrick
