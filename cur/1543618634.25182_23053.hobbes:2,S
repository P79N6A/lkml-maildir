Hello all,
   I have a question with the following kernel code (fs/buffer.c):
   block_write_full_page(struct page *page, get_block_t *get_block)
   {
       ......
       /* OK, are we completely out? */
       if (page->index >= end_index+1 || !offset) {
           UnlockPage(page);
           return -EIO;
       }
       ......
    }
    If the above code is executed, and it return -EIO, where the kernel will use this return
code? and we really arrive here?
thanks.
