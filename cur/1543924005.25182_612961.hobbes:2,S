Christoph, as Rusty found out years ago when he first wrote this code,
you cannot put hard limits on the alloc_percpu() allocations.
They can be done by anyone, any module, and since there was no limit
before you cannot reasonably add one now.
As just one of many examples, several networking devices use
alloc_percpu() for each instance they bring up.  This alone can
request arbitrary amounts of per-cpu data.
Therefore, you'll need to do your optimization without imposing any
size limits.
