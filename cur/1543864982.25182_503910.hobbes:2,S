I implemented the serial driver by myself, :). See the attachment.
I didn't save/restore terminal setting in the my_set_termios().
I trace this back till tty_tioctl(..., unsigned long arg), everytime I
type "ENTER" key,
the argument "arg" passed into tty_ioctl() is the address of a termios
structure, which include wrong c_cflag. It seems once the flag is
assigned by uart_set_options the first time, it's never changed. So
even userspace application changed the flag, it will be set back soon.
I'll dig into it. But I still think it's a bug.
