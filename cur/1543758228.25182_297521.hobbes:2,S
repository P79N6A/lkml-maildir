Hi Ingo,
I have a couple of questions about __up_mutex in rt.c. I'm still using
RT-V0.7.38-06 and this may have changed. I haven't checked.
1) can old_owner ever not be the same as current. IOW can a process
unlock a lock owned by another process?
2) Is it really necessary to call pi_setprio on the old_owner (I guess
if the previous question is true, then this would be too).  If the
process is unlocking a lock, I don't expect it to be also blocked on a
lock so it would not need to iterate the priority list. Wouldn't just
calling mutex_setprio be sufficient?
Thanks,
-- Steve
