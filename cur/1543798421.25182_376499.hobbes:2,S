Did you test this change?  I don't think you understood what the original
problem was.
This is the original definition:
-#define BLKGETSIZE64 _IOR(0x12,114,sizeof(u64))	/* return device
size in bytes (u64 *arg) */
What the author *meant* was to use u64.  What they *got* was size_t.
Unfortunately, changing this to u64 breaks compatibility with userspace.
So we put in some checking code to make sure that people wouldn't make
this kind of mistake any more and converted all the bad users to size_t.
With Linux the size argument is *just* a convention.  Some Unices do
the copyin/copyout thing in the ioctl dispatcher; Linux has the ioctl
handler do the copyin/copyout.  So it does no harm to have the wrong size.
In summary: This change is wrong and causes ABI breakage for
architectures which have sizeof(u64) != sizeof(size_t).
