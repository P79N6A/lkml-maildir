ROFL! Such paranoia!  
I doubt NVidia would sue. It's not just a case of being nice or 
mean, good or evil.  They have to feel as if the company was damaged 
in some way by the patch, or make a case that there was the potential 
for damage. Then they'd have to see if I have enough money to make it 
worth their while to sue.  If I didn't have enough money (and I don't), 
they'd evaluate whether I did anything that threatened their IP (such
as reverse engineering their binary to figure out how to come up with 
the patch).  Clearly that's not what this patch is all about. 
The only thing left is a "test case" to discourage anyone from messing
with their source code.  Somehow I just don't get the feeling that 
they're going to pursue a test case in order to discourage people 
from helping expand the number of potential customers for their 
hardware. ;-)
If I'm wrong, then bring on the lawyers!  That would give me LOTs of 
good column material.
