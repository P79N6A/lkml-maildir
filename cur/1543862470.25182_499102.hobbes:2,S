Hi Simon,
thanks for the patch. It seems that it is based on pre-2.6.20-rc1 kernel 
(this is where the USBHID split happened and generic HID layer was 
introduced). Could you please rebase it against newer version of kernel 
and resend it?
All your changes happen to be in the transport-independent code, so it 
seems that this would be rather trivial task - probably only pathnames 
(and diff offsets) will change - your changes should now go to 
drivers/hid/hid-*, not drivers/usb/input/hid-*.
Thanks,
