I recently compiled 2.4.0-test10-pre3, and was torture-testing
it...I hadnt played any MIDI files in a while, so while one
was playing (on my waveblaster GM daughterboard, thru UART401),
the gave an Oops.
After doing some detective work, I found that the culprit was a
small daemon I had running that does a "double-rmmod -a" every
X seconds.   It was rmmod'ing the uart401 module while it was
in use.   I confirmed that while the MIDI file was playing, the
lsmod usage count was zero, and I could manually remove it.
(causing an instant oops)
It looks like the UART401 (this is a Sound Blaster 16 ISA non-PnP
card) module is not marking itself used while it's being accessed.
