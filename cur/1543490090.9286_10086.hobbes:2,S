Thank you to those who pointed me in the right direction
(asm-i386/io.h).  My grep regexp must have been mal-formed :).
The watchdog is disabled by writes to port 0x80.  which may be a
good/convenient thing for the BIOS, as Roger noted; it ensures the WD is
disabled during startup.  However, i need it enabled without worry that
some part of the kernel is going to disable it accidently.
I would expect the same delay to be produced by reading the port, i.e.
changing the "outb" to "inb".  This (hopefully) will have no effect on
the WD while still providing the requested delay to kernel callers.
Changing the hardware WD, as some of you suggested, is not an option.
This is an off-the-shelf SBC (not my design), and not suited to
resoldering.

But, using port 0x80 to keep the watchdog from activating is a good
way of making sure that the system comes through the POST before the
watchdog kicks in....
Read Alans reply for the hint on how to get along.
