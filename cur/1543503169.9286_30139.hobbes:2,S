My preferred solution is to just add
	if (get_fs() == KERNEL_DS)
		return 0;
at the top of update_vm_cache(). I can't claim that it is much better than
the update_vm_cache_conditional() version, but it is at least a lot
simpler. It makes core-file and quota file writing and sendfile() non-
coherent with mmap. The core-file one is unimportant, the quota file one I
don't know if anybody cares. The sendfile() case we can document and make
a feature.
Does any quota utility mmap() the quota file? That is the big question.
