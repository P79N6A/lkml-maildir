Hi.
We are simulating air interface of GPRS on LAN. A TDMA(time division multiple
access) frame duration is 40ms.  Each TDMA frame consists of 24 timeslots. Each
timeslot  is  of 40/24 ms (i.e 1.66666.......ms) . To know  what current
timeslot it is, we need a timer interrupt after every 1.6666... ms .   Since we
are implementing this on LAN, minor jitters once in a while can be tolerated
(say 0.2 ms more or less once a while would be OK).
     As of now, we are modifying the HZ value in param.h to 600.  This gives us
a CPU tick of  1.6666.... ms. (i.e 1/600sec).  I want to know if it would affect
the perfomance of the CPU.
     Is there a better way to achieve the granularity of 1.666...ms .  Would the
UTIME patch be a better way from performance or any other point of view  than
this method?
With Regards,
Niraj Punmia
