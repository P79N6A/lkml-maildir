I don't see global setup here - just a (rather messy) change of API.
The really interesting question is how you'll handle namei.c code.
Bringing the call of __vfs_follow_link() into do_follow_link() is
not interesting in itself - you still have recursion to eliminate and
that's where the hell will begin.  Change of ->follow_link() prototype
per se doesn't buy anything and is as you admit kludgy.  If you need
it for really interesting stuff - please do show that stuff.
