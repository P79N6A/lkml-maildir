As long as I can still mmap offsets and write directly, I don't think
SGI will have any issue.  For diagnostics, SGI uses mmap of architecture
specific registers and injects errors to ensure signals get completely
through and processed correctly.  Of course, the last time I talked
with anybody about that stuff was more than a year ago and things may
have changed. I can ask around to see if anybody is using write, but I
would be very surprised.
Thanks,
