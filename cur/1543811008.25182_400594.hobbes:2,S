Well to me it says that SMP balancing and scheduling algorithms
will not consider tasks on this CPU. Ie. tasks on this CPU will
not be moved to another, or vice versa.
So I don't consider it a bug, but I'm looking at things from a
very scheduler-centric point of view. Perhaps it wouldn't be
unreasonable to exclude init from isolated CPUs at bootup... I
wouldn't be against such a patch.

I'm not sure how that would happen, if anything I think it would be
an implementation quirk that you should not rely on.

Very cool!
