Yes, but I think
  - integrate our code to your tree
then
  - reimplement (re-design)
is better way to go forward.
This is because the code, which works well in O(n) as current one 
does, will tell you our needs and intentions better than our
babble when you re-design it;  I belive we will achieve better 
design in this way.

Yes, thanks.
I need to check the result of current code and 
to look at diff by byte-to-byte before preparing
patches for current tree.
