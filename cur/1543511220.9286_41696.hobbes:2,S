This is exactly why I meantioned this was a nfsroot machine.  I had
multi-lun enabled since I had a multilun'd device at one point.  I use this
setup mainly to copy files off the systems (quicker than doing it in
windoze) and testing of HW.  I don't want to have to have 2 seperate sets of
modules (the onlything in the kernel is nfs, elf, and a bunch of nic
drivers).
It's not a big deal, I rarely ever use the cdroms on the machines that have
them like this anyway.  I just didn't know that this happens.
