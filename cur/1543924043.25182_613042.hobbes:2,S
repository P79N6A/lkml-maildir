Fair enough.

That's something that can be really helpful I think, yes.

Yes, this is the main thing to comment at the actual site of the barirer.
Although it isn't always 100% clear with locks either (because you might 
do some non-critical operatoins inside a lock section), it just tends to
be clearer what it is being locked, and what other paths are being locked
against.
So describing what accesses are being ordered is good. Also a brief
description of how the lockless read-side works, if it's not obvious
(or you've already described that in your #1).

I think what you've said sounds good. I think that even memory barriers
within some subsystem can use commenting, even if only a line or two.

Ah, right, didn't see them. Thanks, that looks more useful now ;)

Sure. I might personally still separate out the memory ordering fix
and put all the rmb and wmb in a single patch, but that's no big
deal.

OK.

Ah, that's no problem. I manage to screw up patches in much worse
ways than this, don't worry ;)
Thanks,
