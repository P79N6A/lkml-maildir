Yes that was my concern.
But in the end I'm not sure. I made two simple tests and haven't found
any problems with 2.4.0 mm logic (opposed to 2.2.17). In fact, the new
kernel was faster in the more interesting (make -j32) test.
Also I have found that new kernel allocates 4 times more swap space
under some circumstances. That may or may not be alarming, it remains
to be seen.
