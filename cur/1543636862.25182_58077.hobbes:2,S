The pipe test basically tests copy_from_user()/copy_to_user().
The standard implementation of these macros (essentially rep ; movsl)
doesn't exploit the Athlon very well - it is not good at this
instruction. AFAIK Intel CPUs have an faster microcode
implementation for this. 
You could likely do better on Athlon with a copy*user that uses 
an unrolled loop with explicit movls or even SSE.
[similar to the implementation the x86-64 port uses, but without
the NT instructions]
