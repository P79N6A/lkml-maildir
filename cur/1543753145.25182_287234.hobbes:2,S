I fail to see what this delay does. A few lines further down you have a 
mmc_delay which you have removed. That delay was added just to give slow 
cards enough time to power up.

The point here was that it will probably come back to bite us in the ass 
if we create big obstacles for these companies. Even if it's "their own 
fault" they joined the SD card association. But as Alan pointed out the 
specs. are more or less public by now. Trade secret is most likely out 
of the question, but its difficult to know exactly what the contracts 
they have with their members say.
I, personally, would really like to see SD support included in the main 
kernel. But I can also fully understand if that's not currently possible.
