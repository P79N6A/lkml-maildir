I had the same problem with a .config copied and `make oldconfig` from a
2.6.0-test4 kernel (and the -test4 compiled and was running).
I don't really know what's the problem, but CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP=y selects
CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND independent if it or CONFIG_SWAP is selected.
And it's somewhat confusing if one cannot turn off
CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND (after enabling CONFIG_SWAP) via `make
menuconfig` even it is bool.
So the workaroung was to simply disable CONFIG_SLEEP.
