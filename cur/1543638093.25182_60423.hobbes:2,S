Great, got it, thanks: sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF) parses
/proc/cpuinfo
using a simple parser:
#ifndef GET_NPROCS_PARSER
# define GET_NPROCS_PARSER(FP, BUFFER, RESULT)
\
  do
\
    {
\
      (RESULT) = 0;
\
      /* Read all lines and count the lines starting with the string
\
         "processor".  We don't have to fear extremely long lines since
\
         the kernel will not generate them.  8192 bytes are really
\
         enough.  */
\
      while (fgets_unlocked (BUFFER, sizeof (BUFFER), FP) != NULL)
\
        if (strncmp (BUFFER, "processor", 9) == 0)
\
          ++(RESULT);
\
    }
\
  while (0)
#endif
It's being tricked by this:
luyer@praxis8:~$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep '^processor'
processor       : 0
processor id    : 0
processor       : 1
processor id    : 0
The "processor id" line, only present with SMP enabled, is being counted
as a processor.
David.
