Does anyone have a pointer for a MOST (Media Oriented Systems Transport) driver?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Oriented_Systems_Transport
I have seen announcements of Linux systems that support MOST:
http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS2586090082.html
But I have not seen the driver architecture, or the protocol that people are running on them...
Any pointers?
