That's easy for you to say. :)
You don't think the current behaviour is wrong.

With this argumentation, any relative timer could be treated this way, you 
have to base a relative timer on something.
While searching for more information I found the NetBSD code and they 
do exactly this, they just convert everything to absolute values and clock 
set affects all timers equally. Is this now more correct?

Maybe they thought it wouldn't be necessary :), because a periodic is a 
relative timer and thus not affected...
