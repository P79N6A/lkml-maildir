Oh.  It seems that the pte mapping functions will run inc_preempt_count()
via kmap_atomic() even if CONFIG_HIGHPTE=n.  So the ifdef around
page_table_present() needs to be CONFIG_HIGHMEM.  Or we don't use
kmap_atomic() at all in the pte mapping functions.
Please tell me that you had CONFIG_HIGHPTE=n?
