If your modem is lucent based you can download the Lucent produced driver
now. It is a binary only kernel module so you may have trouble however it
has been tested with 2.2.15 and 2.2.12 without problems.
Grab it from 
http://www.linmodems.com/lucent-linux565.zip
I'll be releasing an RPM for it later today.
