git only has one author field. That's not really technically fundamental
(git could be extended to have multiple authors), but it's pretty
fundamental to the work-flow, so in 99% of all cases nothing else makes
sense.
IOW, when I got around to applying the patch, I had two emails with the
same patch to apply, and I picked Paul's explanation and added commentary
about Steven doing the exact same thing in the longer log entry.
I _could_ also have applied both (in different branches) and merged the
two, but since that's not only about three times the work, but also 
against my normal workflow, and I'm lazy...
