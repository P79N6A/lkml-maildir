Not sure.  The configuration I used to build 2.5.64-mm6 was the same as 
every other 2.5 build I've used recently.  All of those included modular 
usb, so I don't believe it is that.  In my case 2.5.64-mm6 is the only 
version on which I see this.  My initial SWAG was some interaction between 
the new pcmcia core and usb, possibly at the pci layer.  I only ever try 
very few mm kernel versions, so I don't have a whole lot of data at the 
moment.
