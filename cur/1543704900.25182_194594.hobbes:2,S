e2fsck is not tied to any particular kernel version.  You should be able to
see the features that ext2 is complaining about with "dumpe2fs -h /dev/hdb2"
in the "Features" line.  I'm guessing it's "needs_recovery" that ext2 doesn't
like.  That means that you didn't unmount the ext3 filesystem cleanly and
now ext2 can't mount it.  Running any non-prehistoric version of e2fsck
will fix it, but as always newer versions are better.  Once e2fsck has
cleaned up the journal, it can be mounted by older kernels as ext2 again.
Cheers, Andreas
