In that case, why was it changed for FAT only? Ext2 will still
happily enlarge a file by truncating it.
If the behavior has to be changed, wouldn't it be better to first
give people a chance to get programs, that rely on the old
behavior fixed, before enforcing the change?
Staroffice (the binary-only version; the new "open source"
version is not yet ready for real-world use) for example
currently doesn't write to FAT filesystems anymore - which is
pretty annoying for people who need it.
Is there somewhere a patch for the current kernel?
