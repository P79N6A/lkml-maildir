Have you edit the build-initrd.sh script to fit your needs? 
Does

 or
  
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0211.1/0551.html
 help?)
Totally different Q's: 
Have you called syslinux with the correct parameter to find your
initrd.gz? 
Do you have access to DOS bootable drive (To try to boot the kernel
using loadlin from DOS command prompt. If that works you know that the
issues are regarded to syslinux, if not - initrd/kernel) (?) 
Have you tried to boot kernel + initrd from your local linux
installation?
