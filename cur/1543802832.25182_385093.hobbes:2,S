OK, I have thought about it and ...
  notifier_call_chain_lockfree() must be called with preempt disabled.
The justification for this routine is to handle all the nasty
corner cases in the notify_die() and similar chains, including panic,
spinlocks being held and even non maskable interrupts.  It is silly to
try to make notifier_call_chain_lockfree() handle the preemptible case
as well.
If notifier_call_chain_lockfree() is to be called for task
notification, then the caller must disable preempt around the call to
notifier_call_chain_lockfree().  Scalability over lots of cpus should
not be an issue, especially if notifier_chain_lockfree_inuse[] is
converted to a per cpu variable.  The amount of time spent with preempt
disabled is proportional to the number of registered callbacks on the
task notifcation chain and to the amount of work performed by those
callbacks, neither of which should be high.
