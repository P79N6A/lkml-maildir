NEEDS_RETRY _does_ terminate, after it exhausts the retries.  But since
by the ASC value we know that no amount of retries is going to work,
this chunk of the patch resolves it quicker, i.e. eliminates the
"NEEDS_RETRY" pointless retries (given the SK/ASC combination).

I suppose this is true, but I'd rather it not even go in
scsi_end_request as (cmd, uptodate=1, good_bytes=0, retry=0) and complete
at the bottom as (cmd, uptodate=0, total_xfer, retry=0).
