True, but it works. It's no more kludged than some other stuff in the
kernel (remember umsdos?). Less kludged actually.
Also, the current USB device naming system in 2.3.20 is a very ugly kludge
that can go away with devfs.

How so? I don't see it breaking anything.

FreeBSD has devfs. Is FreeBSD not Unix?

Only at the source level if CONFIG_DEVFS is not set, and the changes
needed at source level are so minimal that someone with no previous kernel
programming experience could do it in half an hour.

Hot-swapping?
Also, what about kmod/kerneld? We can get by without them...

The key point being *for you*. There are people (PCMCIA, USB, Firewire,
...) who do add/remove devices frequently.

  (Just check /dev/sound to see if there is a soundcard and what it can
  do!)
- Compatibility (with FreeBSD and other BSDs that will take up the
  solution)

This is true for ANYTHING new.

True. But they won't affect you if you say CONFIG_DEVFS=N.
