Message passing can be more costly! On the hardware I develop for,
a "message" involves setting up some DMA control data. Distributed
shared memory has a one-time setup cost, so it is faster for
frequent access to small bits of data.
You could really mess up performance by using a message-passing API
for repeated random access to 8-byte values. Actually, I think the
break-even point is near 2 kB.
