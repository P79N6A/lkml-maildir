We need threads for flushing dirty cache to disk over the time. Only the
VM/FS/VFS code deals with _dirty_ cache.
Other things have other kind of needs (like nfs etc..etc...) and they have
threads as well (kmod for some usec is a kernel thread too).
We launch kupdate/flushd as default because on 99% of the systems
everybody someway writes to disk eventually. (if your root (and only)  
filesystem is ramfs/cramfs [like it could be on an embedded device] you
can as well turn them off.

kupdate/kflushd also flushes the vfs dirty cache to disk ;).
