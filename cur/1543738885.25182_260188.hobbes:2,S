Hello,
Sorry, I've changed my mind, according to the thread of 
"[PATCH] net: fix smc91x build for sh/ppc" (Oct 12, 2004).
I prefer that set_irq_type() is snipped by CONFIG_ARM, too.
Please throw away this patch and retrieve the previous 
m32r-trivial-fix-of-smc91xh.patch again, 
if the above patch "[PATCH] net: fix smc91x build for sh/ppc" is applied.
Thank you.
