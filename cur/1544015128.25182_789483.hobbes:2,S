Hm, that could be pretty simple to handle.  I'd really like to force the
kobject itself to be dynamic, and inside the private portion of the
device structure.  If I do that, then get_ and put_ would need to
allocate the object if it wasn't present.  But that would mean that
get_device could sleep, which isn't the case today (put_device() can
always sleep, that's not an issue.)

Well, I'd always recommend doing things in non-atomic context wherever
possible, so I'll not object that hard to your patch either way :)

yeah, that would be a much bigger task than I'm really pondering,
although it probably is the correct thing to do...
