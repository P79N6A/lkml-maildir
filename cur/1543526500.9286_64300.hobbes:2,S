Great.  Now instead of just catting my kernel to a floppy and it just
'works', I'll have to make a boot disk with ext2 or minix on it and figure
out what files out of what packages I need just to query a bootp server. 
ATM, I don't know how to leave initrd (I never looked)
I understand that DHCP can just change your IP while you're running.  No
problem since I haven't been using DHCP (and wouldn't use it for diskless
boxes).
Personally, for diskless machines which boots the kernel directly (no lilo,
no syslinux, etc) this is a good thing.  (Or atleast I believe so)  I've
never used ip autoconfig using arp except once where I had a digiport server
that would do this but not bootp.  Anyway, I atleast hope that bootp
autoconfig isn't removed from the kernel for this reason.
