be that as it may, it still means you need to take it into account
whenever someone says they want to entirely remove the
SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED macro from the source tree, as suggested in
Documentation/spinlocks.txt.
if you do that removal, you can always replace SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED with
its current definition of __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED(old_style_spin_init),
or what have you.  but you would obviously have to replace it with
*something* that represents an unnamed spinlock if SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED
goes away.

p.s.  just FYI:
$ grep -r "\.\.\..*SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED" *
arch/sparc/lib/atomic32.c:      [0 ... (ATOMIC_HASH_SIZE-1)] = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED
arch/cris/arch-v32/kernel/smp.c:spinlock_t cris_atomic_locks[] = { [0 ... LOCK_COUNT - 1] = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED};
arch/parisc/lib/bitops.c:       [0 ... (ATOMIC_HASH_SIZE-1)]  = __RAW_SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED
arch/mips/kernel/gdb-stub.c:    [0 ... NR_CPUS-1] = __RAW_SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED,
arch/powerpc/platforms/iseries/htab.c:  { [0 ... 63] = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED};
so, as matthew says, it's clearly not for drivers.
