You already have such an app. It is called 'renice' (and 'nice'). Most
people can work out how to use those. :-)
You also have graphical apps to do the job. For example, in KDE, try
starting the "KDE System Guard" application (usually bound to the
CTRL+ESC hotkey) and you'll see a nice list of all running processes.
If you right-click a process you'll get a drop-down box with the
bottom entry being "Renice Process...", simply click that and you can
adjust the priority of that process.  You can also easily make it so
that whenever you start a given application it gets niced to a
specific priority; simply (again assuming KDE) right-click the icon
you use to launch the application and edit it, select the
"Application" tab and in the "Command: " field prefix the command used
to launch the application with 'nice' and the priority you want, save
your changes and the next time you launch that app it'll get the
priority you wish.
Gnome and most other environments also have similar capabilities.
