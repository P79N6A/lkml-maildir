Subject: [PATCH] make config w/ Pentium-II
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I built 2.4.0-test10 for my laptop and got caught out by `make config'.
When I typed `Pentium-II' for my CPU type, it selected Pentium-III and
my kernel wouldn't boot.  To prevent errors of this type, please apply
this patch.  As a bonus, `Celeron' will now work as an answer too.
Please apply.
