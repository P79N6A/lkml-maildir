Please note, this patch introduces only small parts of it.
It doesn't introduce the code which creates containers/destroys them etc.
As I mentioned in another email:
In OpenVZ we have 2-level refcounting (mentioned recently by Linus as in 
mm). Process counter is used to decide when container should 
collapse/cleanuped and real refcounter is used to free the structures 
which can be referenced from somewhere else.
