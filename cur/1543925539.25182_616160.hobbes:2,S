Well I wrote the initial driver mostly as a rather quick hack. I
didn't have access to other hw from the s1d13 family (other than the
806) at that time, and could only guess that supporting them shouldn't
be too complicated. Nowadays I don't even have access to the 806
itself anymore, so I'm afraid I won't be of much help.
