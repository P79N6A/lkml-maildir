Got NVidia's tarball, did the --extract-only thing, applied
the Minion patch, 'cp Makefile.kbuild Makefile', reboot to the
-mm2 kernel, 'cd src/NVdia<mumble>/usr/src/nv && make'.
Actually, I've just had to do the 'make' for the last umpteen kernel
revs - the Makefile dates back to Aug 4, and Sep 5 I had to apply a
2-line fix to nv-linux.h.
Not sure if the nv driver could be more stable - the last time I was
able to tickle the NVidia code into crashing either XFree86 or the kernel
was back in the 2.5.6* time frame.
