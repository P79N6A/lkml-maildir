    Well, if it brings us ugly semantics, keeping those two lines out for
                               ^^^^^^^^^
    a while can help merge a lot...

I could remove this check.
But it would only cause confusion.  How would the userspace utilities
differentiate between the safe out-of-kernel and the unsafe in-kernel
module?  Adding hacks to make this possible is far more ugly IMO than
integrating the current well tested solution.
It makes no sense.  If someone would give me a rational explanation
why it is bad, I would be content.  But you just tell me it's
terrible, ugly, crap which may well be true, but are not technical
terms, which I can relate to.

Please do.  I want it too.
_When_ we have a better solution, all the hacks can be removed, and
the world will rejoice.
Until then, let the hacks live!  Please!
Thanks,
Miklos
