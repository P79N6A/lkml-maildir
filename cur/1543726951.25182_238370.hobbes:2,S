I guess you mean most users of the original pmdisk code, as it originally 
defaulted to platform (which in most cases should be ACPI S4). I mean, S4 
is not even remotely as obscure as S3. Then again, S4BIOS or other 
firmware methods are different beasts.
For the reference, original pmdisk code worked fine with platform on my 
laptop the last time I checked (several months ago).
