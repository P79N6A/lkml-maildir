such lockups can be detected either via pressing RightALT-ScrollLock [in
fact i've 'detected' such a lockup during doing the above fixes]; or via
using the IKD patch's soft lockup detection. (which i originally
implemented to keep exactly such code out of the main kernel)

no doubt about that, but it just doesnt belong into the main kernel i'm
quite sure. In IKD you can get much more on a lockup than just the
backtrace (you can get an event trace and an 'exact' backtrace).
btw., there still appears to be something weird going on in TLB-flush
land, so not all bugs are fixed yet. Is it absolutely stable on your box
if you untar/tar big filetrees? I got one sporadic failed compression
(which just shuoldnt happen), and a sporadic NULL crash in leave_mm()'s
->active_mm deref. Reverting the pre2-2.3.43 TLB changes solves the
problem. Any ideas?
