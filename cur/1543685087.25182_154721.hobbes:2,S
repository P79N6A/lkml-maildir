We had the same situation a while back (2.2.x, early 2.4.x era) with systems
that had (have, they still exist) a 1 second WD tied to the hard RESET line.
1 second with interrupts off == reboot.  Let me tell you, we found a LOT of
places where there were problems.  Network drivers, routing stuff, SCSI,
etc.  We fixed some, and hacked around some in this same manner.
Now, if I have a chance to port Cobalt crap to 2.6, we'll see how many of
our changes were merged, in concept or in code.
