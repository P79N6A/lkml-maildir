Hi -
This is a patch of a new optional function for task assignment to cgroup, RFC.
== Purpose =================================================
To provide the function that leads a task, corresponding to the conditions specified
beforehand, to a specific cgroup directory.
== Description =============================================
This patch provides the function that leads a task, corresponding to the conditions
specified beforehand, to a specific cgroup directory.
Currently, this patch uses user-id as a condition to lead a task. On its I/F,
specifies user-id of a task and a cgroup directory.
The task set to specified user-id will automatically lead to the cgroup directory.
(it is attached to specific cgroup)
This function makes possible to attach a task to cgroup automatically when
specific user logs in, also to attach a task of a service which is set to
specific effective user-id to specific cgroup mechanically.
This function is just option, all the functions of cgroup are the same.
Also the migration of a task between cgroup directories can do by rewriting pid
of a control tasks file, including a task leading by this option.
It is able to enter two or more set of user-id and cgroup directory.
Specified cgroup directory may be the same or that may not be.
But it's not able to enter same user-id to plural cgroup directories to lead.
== Interface ===============================================
   /lead_option  -  control file of this option
[example for reading a configuration]
       # cat /cgroup/lead_option
       uid:202        leadto:/cpuset/bar_cg
       uid:201        leadto:/cpuset/foo_cg
      * nothing appears before assignment.
[example for adding an entry]
- To lead a task(uid 201) to /cgroup/foo_cg
       # echo uid:201 leadto:/cpuset/foo_cg > /cpuset/lead_option
       * set a uid of task and cgroup dirctory to lead.
       * Remake an entry uid to cgroup directory if set uid already exists.
[example for delete an entry]
- To delete an entry of uid
       # echo uid:201 > /cpuset/lead_option
       * To delete a registration, omit "leadto:" token.
== Operation example (chronological order) ==================
The follows is an example of the operation.
