I think you should.  The whole point behind RDMA is that these APIs exist and are being 
used by real-world applications.  You can't just ignore them because they're inconvenient. 
  If you're not willing to cater to these API's needs, then you may as well tell all the 
RDMA developers to forgot about Linux and port everything to Windows instead.
The APIs are here to stay, and the whole point behind this thread is to discuss how Linux 
can support them.
