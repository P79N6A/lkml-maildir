And how do you plan to get correct default label without taking
paths/names into account but only the parent directory, for these
files created by the exact same text editor:
- $HOME/.slrnrc
- $HOME/.fetchmailrc
- $HOME/.procmailrc
- $HOME/todo.txt

Something will have to tell the system that certain file names/paths
are a-priori special, whether they exist or not.  And I *mean* file
names, not objects.  And that won't happen reliably in userspace.

Well, take the example of .procmailrc.  It is a file that is taken
into account if it exists, but doesn't have to exist.  It is a file
which can be used to copy all the mail of one user to somewhere else,
so it is very data-security sensitive.  So this is a file that may or
may not exist, which should not be created by anybody else than the
user itself (after all, you're into protecting from root too), and
needs to be able to be created by a mac-unaware, user-preferred text
editor and just work.  How do you expect to handle that reliably
without path-based mechanisms in the kernel?
You need path-based mechanisms to at least:
- prevent/allow some specific names from being created in specific
  conditions. 
- give correct default labels to new files
Object labelling won't help here simply because all of that happens on
file creation.  And you need path-based mechanisms if you want to have
any kind of decent problem tolerance.  Because at that point, SELinux
having prevented me twice to log into my own system on the console
with two different distributions for similar causes (labels lost), I
won't trust it for any system I want to be able to access remotely
with a decent chance of success in case of problems.
