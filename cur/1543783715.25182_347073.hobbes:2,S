	I personally was under the impression that "syscalls are not
to be added".  I'm also wary of the effort required to hook into process
exit.  Not to mention all the lifetiming that has to be written again.
	On top of that, we lose our cute ability to shell script it.  We
find this very useful in testing, and think others would in practice.

	I thought I stated this in my other email.  We're not intending
to extend dlmfs.  It pretty much covers the simple DLM usage required of
a simple interface.  The OCFS2 DLM does not provide any other
functionality.
	If the OCFS2 DLM grew more functionality, or you consider the
GFS2 DLM that already has it (and a less intuitive interface via sysfs
IIRC), I would contend that dlmfs still has a place.  It's simple to use
and understand, and it's usable from shell scripts and other simple
code.
