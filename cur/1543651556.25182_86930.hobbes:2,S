	If pci_do_fixups determines that f->vendor and f->device do
not match the device in question, it will not call the corresponding
f->hook, so it is OK for that f->hook to point to the address of a
discarded __init routine that now contains garbage as long as the
ID's will not match any hot plugged device.
