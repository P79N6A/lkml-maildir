Hi,
I am running a custom compiled 2.2.17 kernel on a Debian system.
I keep finding these in my syslog :
kerneL VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for kswapd...
This isn't limited to 'kswapd', i've seen kupdate, klogd, syslogd, init,
bash among others.
I have no clue to what these messages actually mean.
I don't think I am supposed to get these kind of message though.
Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this?
