A minor issue...
How does Marcelo (or Linus or Alan, say) know that the patch _really_ came from
the subsystem aintainer himself?  I mean anybody would have sent any crap, but
not too bad enough to suspect.  But if it came with a CC to a list, there is a
much smaller chance of this happenning.
Yes.  This would be very rare and the effects would be very short lived.  But
still the _possibility_ exists.
Cheers,
Anuradha
