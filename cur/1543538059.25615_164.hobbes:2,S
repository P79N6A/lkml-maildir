BadCRC is just a report that your drive/controller believe your ide cable
is bogus.  nothing more or less.  it's not harmful, since Linux retries 
such failed transactions.  and the solution is just to fix the cabling
(ie, <=18", both ends plugged in, and use the new 80-conductor cable for 
udma66 (doesn't hurt on lower modes, either))
it seems like BadCRC reports most often result from people running udma66
with normal 40-conductor cables.  this can happen when a driver update 
adds udma66 functionality...
