No, why do you have the '*' -- dma_mask isn't a pointer, is it?
You probably want:
	printk(KERN_ERR "hey,jason,see,dma_mask is %llx\n",
	       (unsigned long long) dev->dev.dma_mask);
(I would use a "%llx" format because masks are much clearer in hex).
The cast to unsigned long long is there because u64 is just unsigned
long on some 64-bit platforms, so you get a warning about the format
not matching on some architectures without the cast.
