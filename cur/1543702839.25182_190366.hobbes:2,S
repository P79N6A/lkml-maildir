Aye, userspace doesn't always know it, and the ioctl for /dev/rawctl
only uses major:minor.
That's too bad, because raw.c is one of the few users of blkdev_get() in
the kernel (the others being drivers/s390/block/dasd_genhd.c,
partitions/check.c and fs/block_dev.c itself). Could have got rid of
this crap :)
