The issue is not the warn message.
Non critical allocations (such as this case of sg_low_malloc()) are trying
to get additional memory to optimize things -- we want the allocator to be
lazy and fail previously instead doing hard work. If kswapd cannot keep up
with the memory pressure, we're surely in a memory shortage state.
Its better to get out of the memory shortage instead running into OOM
because of some optimization, I guess.
Another example of such a flag is swapin readahead.
