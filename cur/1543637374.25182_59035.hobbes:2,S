Do we really want to introduce another locking primitive?
pte_chain_lock is special, because we have so many struct page's,
and open-coding that locking is a good way to express that
specialness.  But if we go and formalise "spin_lock_bit" then
everyone will start using them, and that's not necessarily
a thing we want to happen?
I did some testing yesterday with fork/exec/exit-intensive
workloads and the contention rate on pte_chain_lock was 0.3%,
so the efficiency problems which Linus described are unlikely
to bite us in this particular application.  But if the usage
of spin_lock_bit() were to widen, some platforms may be impacted.
