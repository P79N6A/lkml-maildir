I want to make a program that gives system information by
directly accessing kernel structures.
1) One way is to make my own system calls and link it to
kernel.
2) Another way is to make a kernel module and link it by
insmod.
Is there any other way to access kernel information.
I do not want to use the proc file system.
Thanks
Vivek
