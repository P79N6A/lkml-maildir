I removed avoid_irq_share because the current pnp code, like the previous, does 
not allow irq sharing.  Also it corrupts the device rule structure by replacing 
it with modified values that may not apply after devices are disabled etc.
Is there a set of conditions I could follow to determine if a serial pnp device 
is capable of irq sharing, and also with which other devices can a capable 
device share an irq?  If so, I could have the resource manager handle this type 
of situation when few irqs are available.
Thanks,
Adam
