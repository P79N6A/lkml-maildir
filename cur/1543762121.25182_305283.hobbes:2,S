Thanks; I'll fix these and submit a patch (or two) after some testing.

OK.

This seems to be somewhat obsolete now since most drivers have moved to
use get_drvinfo of ethtool_ops; I'll do the same.

This is actually very common for PC Card drivers in the current kernel
tree.. I'll change Host AP to kmalloc this, but someone might consider
going through all *_cs.c drivers..
