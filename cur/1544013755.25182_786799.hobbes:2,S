I tend to hang onto things I like, even if they aren't right yet.
We really really need to push ahead with fixing this stuff.  Because of
this problem the number of bugs which people are adding, and the number
of subsequent fixup patches (ALL of which are fugly and stupid) is just
out of control, and quite unnecessary.
Maybe we should just do the switch, send best-effort fixup patches at
the arch maintainers and move on.
