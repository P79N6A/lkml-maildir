I might just be new-fangled, but I have a /cgroup mount.
but I guess that's just different mount-point of cgroup, right?

Right.

Depends a bit, the genirq layer seems to allow for irqs that can't be
freely placed. But most of them can be given a free mask - /me looks @
tglx/ingo.

I see the issue. We don't support mv on cgroups, right? To easily create
common parents...

Hmm, but that would then be another controller based on cpus. Might be a
tad confusing. Might be needed. I'll ponder..

I'm not sure I know what you're asking. IRQ are hardware notifiers and
do all kinds of things depending on the hardware. Network cards
typically use them to notify the CPU of incoming packets. Video cards
can do vsync notifiers, empty dma buffers, whatnot.

I'm fine with whatever, I saw a ',' in the bitmap stuff, not really sure
how that ended up being a ' ' in the patch I send out... :-)
