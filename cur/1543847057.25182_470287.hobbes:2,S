Actually I have also experienced some ext3 corruption (*) on my virtual 
machine under qemu emulation with 2.6.18-mm3, but I thought my previous 
other "strange" activities were guilty. Now it seems that there could be 
indeed something rotten in ext3 driver. Will try to reproduce, and if I am 
able to do so, I will bisect.
(*) Similar symptoms to the original poster - just fsck finding a few 
orphaned entries and lost blocks, etc.
