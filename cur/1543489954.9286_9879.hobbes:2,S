There are many regular files in /proc. Many of them contain data that can
be treated as "record oriented". But they are not, because it was easy
enough
to implement them as proper regular files (i.e. a stream of bytes, NO
records). For /proc/<pid>/maps it is not easy to do that. And now you tell
me that it is "intentional"? No, its just an excuse, although a valid and
good one. Good, but not perfect. Yet Linux is.

Tigran.
