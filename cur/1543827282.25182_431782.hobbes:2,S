Compatibility? Upgradability? Simplicity? Supportability?
Even ignoring all those arguments, i find your "ext3/ext4 is too 
complex, use XFS or JFS" argument a bit naive. Please take a quick look 
at the linecount of the filesystems in question:
                  LOC
   ------------------
   ext2:         7492
   ext3+jbd:    22197
   ext4+jbd:    24312
   reiser3:     28857
   reiser4:     79189
   JFS:         32819
   XFS:        110718
the ext3 -> ext4 patches add +2115 lines of code (which 2115 lines solve 
the biggest performance and scaling problem ext3 currently has), which 
is 1.9% of the linecount of XFS.

frankly, i'll leave that decision to the ext3 developers and obviously, 
to distributors. Their filesystem has handled my data for 10 years, and 
they have been very conservative about their technical choices 
throughout. I trust them to not mess up this time either.
ext3 does quite a few things to stay compatible with ext2 - and frankly, 
i very much expected it to do that when i migrated my ext2 data to ext3. 
The days of "change the world in an incompatible way and dont look back" 
are gone.
