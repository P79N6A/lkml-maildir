uname [the shell command] is a wrapper around the uname  system call:
man 1 uname
man 2 uname

From a strace -v of uname:
uname({sysname="Linux", 
       nodename="arachne", 
       release="2.2.18-00",
       version="#9 Wed Jan 3 13:48:37 GMT 2001", 
       machine="i686"}) = 0

You can [and may] use uname to get the kernel version string. I am less
certain about the exact layout of the module tree under 2.4.3.
