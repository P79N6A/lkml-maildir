I just traced what ldd does:
ldd is a shell script, and the command causing the crash actually is:
/lib/ld-linux.so.2 --verify "./core"
This command crashes 2.2.0 as ldd ./core does. 
A quick look at the code shows that ld-linux, in the --verify case, 
doesn't really execute core, it mmaps it and tries to decide if
core is an elf executable. But I didn't really try to understand 
what ld-linux does...
