Well, that "of course" shouldn't be there - it should work, using the
standard cdrecord.
You don't even need to recompile a cdrecord if you have a reasonably
recent distibution. Just use
	cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc
and it should "just work".
There's been at least one report that trying to write a DVD with packet
writing (ie by just mounting it read-write and writing to it) doesn't
work. That one seems to be due to the generic cdrom.c code getting the
size of the disk wrong. There was a patch floating around for testing, but
I never got any feedback on that apart from the original success story.
But if you have a DVD-R, then that shouldn't even be an issue, methinks.
