Well yes that's true. I meant the "sched_clock interface as defined". Now
there are obviously issues (including the one you raised) that makes the
sched_clock interface unreasonable to implement.
I stand by my first reply to your comment WRT the API. Seems like most of
the rest of the debate was unrelated or concerning implementation details.
kernel/sched.c patches implementing the new API would get an ack from me.
