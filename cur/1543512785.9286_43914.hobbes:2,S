    I've made a patch that makes all of the individual options for SysRQ into
    sysctl's. However Alan somehow didn't like it, so it never got into the
    kernel. I never got an explanation.
Yes, a well-known complaint. In this case I agree with Alan.
Of course I have no idea of Alan's reasoning, but mine would say:
(i) SysRq is a wart that some people like, so it exists, but it is certainly
not an official part of the Linux API. Such a wart must be very localized
in the source code. It must not grow and develop sub-warts or cause
changes elsewhere in the code.
(ii) The reason SysRq exists is that people want to use the keyboard in some
emergency cases, when something went very wrong. It is a human interface,
not a software interface.
