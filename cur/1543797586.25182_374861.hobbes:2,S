This one is just for the record, as it doesn't appear to have had
 any side effects...
Dell Latitude D610, uptodate FC4, kernel 2.6.15-rc5, booted with
 libata.atapi_enabled=1.
Dec 10 19:33:26 sandman kernel: cdrom: This disc doesn't have any
tracks I recognize!
Dec 10 19:35:21 sandman kernel: Assertion failed! qc->n_elem >

This happened presumably when I earlier burned a CD-R
 with .wav audio tracks; the burning was successful.
