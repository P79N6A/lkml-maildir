Hi everybody.
I have very similar problems as Ben. I have 4 machines with Asus P3C-D
motherboards (the one with rambus) and they use the i820 chipset.
I have severe stabilityproblems here, both in SMP and UP.
I also use a D-Link DFE-570TX card in all of these machines and they act
as routers.
SMP with IO-APIC is worst, then comes SMP without IO-APIC and best is UP
without IO-APIC (havn't tried with IO-APIC).
I can usually make SMP with IO-APIC hang within 30-45 minutes by letting
it route some quite heavy traffic. But sometimes it locks up after a few
hours and sometimes (rare) a few days.
SMP without IO-APIC usually lasts a little bit longer but not that much.
UP can last for over a week but sometimes it only holds up for a few
hours.
I've tried a _lot_ of kernels, ranging from 2.3.99 ones to 2.4.8-ac12.
2.4.8-ac12 seemed to be quite stable on this router as it survived my
tests for >30 h. But it dies within 10minutes after I put it into
prouction :( So now it runs UP and it dies again a few minutes again
(watchdog-cards are a wonderful thing).
It's totally unresponsive when it dies. No numlock or anything, and if I
enable nmi_watchdog there's no diffrence, it doesn't say anything. The
machine is totally unresponsive in all ways.
Does any of you have any ideas to what I might try?
