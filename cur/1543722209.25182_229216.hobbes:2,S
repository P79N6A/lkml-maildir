Plural devices(partitions) can be registered to the diskdump as dump
device, so it seems difficult to represent a dump relationship with a 
symlink.
Possible idea is adding new attribute to somewhere of sysfs entry,
for example /sys/block/sda/sda1/dumpdev.
When new device is added, echo 1 to this entry.
# echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/sda1/dumpdev
Its store function is as follows.
static ssize_t store(struct kobject * kobj, struct attribute * attr, 
                     const char * buf, size_t count)
{
        ssize_t ret;
        struct gendisk *disk = 
        	container_of(p->kobj.parent, struct gendisk, kobj);
        return dump_register_device(disk);
}
The problem is how to get scsi_device from gendisk.
It seems that the method using sysfs is more complex than current method
using proc...
It may be better to use simply module parameter like netdump.
