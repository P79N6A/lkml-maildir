You run your program, but I have created a simlink in /tmp with the
same name (because the name is guessable).  That is a race because it
relies on contention between two processes (my "ln -s" and your broken
program) over a shared resource (the easily-guessable name in the
shared namespace of the filesystem).  This is the definition of a
race.  You may not call it that, but everyone else would.

Agreed.
