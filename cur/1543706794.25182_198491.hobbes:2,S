These result from the ide/dma code. Those errors are normally thrown
(someone correct me if i'm wrong) if ecc on that particular sector
fails. A EIO error is thrown, and is handed over to the layer above
(xfs in your case). These errors happen as well if you do raw reads
on those sectors.

This is EIO handed over to xfs.

I don't think this will help. The proplem is probably all about a
broken sector on your disk. And if i understand the ide code correctly
you can't do anything about that.

Yes, that's the most likely case. Smartmontools (smartctl) should show
errors on the sectors mentioned in your dumps as well (they do here).
Error 1689 occurred at disk power-on lifetime: 703 hours
  When the command that caused the error occurred, the device was active or idle
  After command completion occurred, registers were:
  ER ST SC SN CL CH DH
  -- -- -- -- -- -- --
  40 51 00 2c 46 58 e0  Error: UNC
  Commands leading to the command that caused the error were:
  CR FR SC SN CL CH DH DC   Timestamp  Command/Feature_Name
  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   ---------  --------------------
  25 00 30 23 46 58 e0 00    3864.401  READ DMA EXT
  25 00 32 21 46 58 e0 00    3860.425  READ DMA EXT
  25 00 34 1f 46 58 e0 00    3843.845  READ DMA EXT
  25 00 36 1d 46 58 e0 00    3839.939  READ DMA EXT
  25 00 38 1b 46 58 e0 00    3839.914  READ DMA EXT
And so on.
