I mentioned before that this kernel was giving me problems with nvidia (fixed 
thanks to "jedi/sector one") and vmware. Now I'm at home so I booted 
2.6.9-rc2-mm1 and this is what vmware is saying:
    "Could not mmap 139264 bytes of memory from file offset 0 at (nil):
    Operation not permitted. Failed to allocate shared memory."
Anyone knows what's going on here?
Many thanks in advance,
Norberto
