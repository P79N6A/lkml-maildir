So, all of my applications and support programs should run with their
CWD set to /coredumps?  I don't want to flame here, but "get real".
That is almost as good as saying that to get security you just need to
make sure no one bad is using your system.

Well, this does make unique file names, almost.  But it does not really
identify the file.  Plus, in a cluster of machines, many of them have
the same PIDs.  (Say, 100 machines, you get 100 of each PID)
