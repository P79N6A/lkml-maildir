Hi...
I have a problem with nfs. It always worked, so I don't know what is
failing now.
I have a server running 2.6.11-rc3-mm2. I try to export a dir via nfs:
/etc/exports:
  /raid belly.cps.unizar.es(ro,insecure,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)
nada:/proc/fs/nfs# exportfs -v 
/raid           belly.cps.unizar.es(ro,wdelay,insecure,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)
So it looks ok...
But when I try to mount it from OSX:
belly:~ root# mount nada:/raid ./w
mount_nfs: can't access /raid: Permission denied
But the server shows it got mounted:
nada:/var/lib/nfs# cat rmtab
155.210.152.151:belly.cps.unizar.es:0x00000001
belly.cps.unizar.es:/raid:0x00000001
If I now restart nfs:
nada:/var/lib/nfs# service nfs restart

Starting NFS mountd:                                            [  OK  ]
nada:/var/lib/nfs# cat /proc/fs/nfs/exports
# Version 1.1
# Path Client(Flags) # IPs
Nothing ?
What is wrong with this setup ?
Kernel is 2.6.11-rc3-mm2, nfs-utils-1.0.7.
TIA
