Hello,
Yes, I meant .18.  Jeff, this should be fixed before 2.6.18 is released. 
  It's not the question of whether CFA support is implemented or not. 
We're sanity-checking in 2.6.18-rcX anyway and it's the sanity checking 
which is causing problem.  What seems to have happened is...
1. CFA support is implemented
2. CFA check was added (backported) to upstream-fixes, but it was incorrect.
So, we need to do one of two things.
* apply this patch to 2.6.18-rcX
* remove ata_id_is_cfa() check altogether
