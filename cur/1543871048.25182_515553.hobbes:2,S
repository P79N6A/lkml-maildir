? are dead ones,  
 [<c16191d9>] do_exit+0x6f9/0x6fd
 [<c161924d>] sys_exit_group+0x0/0x11
 [<c161925c>] sys_exit_group+0xf/0x11
 [<c1603e72>] sysenter_past_esp+0x5f/0x99
The interesting part is here:
1 lock held by udevd/918:
 #0:  (&mm->mmap_sem){----}, at: [<c161135b>] do_page_fault+0x150/0x50d
But udevd/918 is nowhere in the sysrq-t output.
