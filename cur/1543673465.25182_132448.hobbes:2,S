I would much prefer to have only:
+ SECURITY_INIT
and moving the common stuff to include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h.
Note that I moved definition of _start and _stop inside brackets.
Doing this makes sure the start address is always correct, independent
of the end address of last section.
Starting a new section will align to member with biggest alignment,
so we may see _start have a wrong value in some cases.
Using SECURITY_INIT will make changes to all architectures
even more trivial.
