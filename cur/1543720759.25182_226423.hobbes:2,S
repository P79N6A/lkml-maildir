Yep.  I remember that code.  CQual does complain about it.
A similar situation arises in tty code, which passes around a flag
"from_user" to indicate whether another pointer is a user pointer or
kernel pointer.  See, for example, drivers/char/pty.c:pty_write(). 
CQual complains about that, too.  How about sparse?
We describe two ways of fixing this kind of code in the "Working around
false positives" section of that paper.  The simpler workaround will
probably work for sparse.  Basically rewrite the function
static int pty_write(struct tty_struct * tty, int from_user,
		       const unsigned char *buf, int count);
as
static int pty_write(struct tty_struct * tty, int from_user,
		       const unsigned char __user   *ubuf, 
                       const unsigned char __kernel *kbuf,
                       int count)
(In this case, you can even eliminate the from_user flag by just
checking which of ubuf and kbuf is non-NULL).
The slicker work-around involves passing a function pointer for
accessing the buffer, like in the example I gave in the other email. 
This works for cqual, but probably wouldn't help sparse.

I agree it would be difficult.  I have some vague ideas how to prove
this safe automatically, but nothing I plan to implement any time soon.

I think the key point is to make pointers either be always user pointers
or always kernel pointers.  Their type shouldn't depend on some other
flag.
I fear that completely separating ioctl and kernel data structures would
result in lots of redundant structure definitions, which will lead to
code maintainence problems and their own host of bugs.  Would it be
better to just design a bug finding tool that's capable of keeping track
of different structure instances separately?
Best,
Rob
