I take an exception to that. I think useroace is not concerned with
topology and ownership of logical devices, the data is more important.
I.e. you need to know that some pin respons to CPU temperature but you
don't really care that it connected to it87 as opposed to some other
chip. Therefore I think that ldev should translate to exactly the same
underlying object. Consider the picture below:
        GPIO0     GPIO1   GPIO2 GPIO3
          |         |       |     |
       pc87266   sc1100     blah123
          |         |
         WDT0      WDT1
This will allow:
- map every hardware piece (not entire chip, separate functions) to a
device file to userspace can use standard read/write/select/poll if
choses so.
- easily represent them in sysfs and also allow userspace access to
individual bits through sysfs attributes.
- will not give headaches with poer management when half of device is
powered down and half is active.
- provided that there are alternative interfaces outlined above
superio can be decoupled from the connector.
I wonder if it should be called "gpio" bus as opposed to superio
because only chips are "super", the bus consists of very simple
devices and drivers.

We are getting there I believe ;)
