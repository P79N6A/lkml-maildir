| 45 functions for 2.5.68, 44 for 2.5.67. The new one is this:
| 0xc0881136 mxb_init_done:                      sub    $0x51c,%esp
| 
| Michael, are there any reasons not to make saa7740_init static, global
| or both? The memory is gone forever either way.
| Moreover, wouldn't this be a candidate for __init and __initdata
| respectively?
| 
| Apart from that, patches for the marked (P) functions are in -je1, but
| might need some shaping up. Handle with care.
| 
| Everything else remains unchanged since 2.5.67.
| 
| 0xc05cff3c parport_config:                     sub    $0x490,%esp
| 0xc0c12366 sw_connect:                         sub    $0x490,%esp
| 0xc0c36c73 ixj_config:                         sub    $0x484,%esp
| 0xc0c18ef1 uinput_alloc_device:                sub    $0x480,%esp
For PCMCIA/PC Card drivers (parport and ixj above), what context do the
pcmcia event handlers run in?  Can they kmalloc()?  with what gfp_flags?
I'll post patches for sw_connect() and uinput_alloc_device() shortly.
