Subject: set keyboard repeat rate: EVIOCGREP and EVIOCSREP

I was wondering if anyone knows how to change the repeatrate on a USB keyboard with a 2.4 kernel.  The system is a legacy free system (no ps2 port), so kbdrate does nothing.  With evdev loaded, the keyboard and mouse (both USB devices) get registered with the event system and show up as /dev/input/event[01].  I know the event subsystem does software key repeating and was wondering how to change that.
I poked around and found the EVIOCGREP and EVIOCSREP ioctls, but when I tried using them, the ioctl returned invalid parameter.  Upon further investigation, I found that the ioctl definitions (located in the linux/input.h header file) are not used in kernel land.  That would explain why it failed, but that just means I ran into a dead end.  Were those definitions legacy code from 2.2 or is it something that never got implemented, only defined?  I also noticed that the defines are gone in 2.6.  So how _does_ one go about changing the repeat rate on a keyboard input device in 2.4?
Thanks in advance for your help.
