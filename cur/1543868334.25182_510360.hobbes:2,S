I think this option actually _used_ to mean whether the BIOS would _provide_ 
PNP services to the host OS, allowing it to detect peripherals like parallel 
ports, etc. In reality, very few devices on modern PCs use or require BIOS 
PNP support, and in some situations it's just annoying (for example, 
disabling the parallel port on my Thinkpad has no effect because Linux just 
uses PNP to redetect it).

In my experience it just makes no difference. I strongly doubt the option has 
_anything_ to do with this problem.
