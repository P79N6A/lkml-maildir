Side note: if you want the strange POSIX guarantees that Dan quoted 
(atomicity between write and fstat), you'd almost have to do it with 
user-space crapola magic locks. Doing it in the kernel would just be 
insane, you'd have to have some per-process "IO semaphore".
(Doing it in user space _also_ sounds insane, but then you could have a 
switch like "POSIX me harder, and do all the really stupid things" at 
compile time or something)
