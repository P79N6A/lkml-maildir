I'm glad to hear that!  But the cpu resource controller has
some problems, for example:
- The controller only controls the time_slice value and doesn't
  care the balance of cpus (the controller leaves balancing to 
  the existing balancing code in the scheduler).  So far I don't
  have any good idea to solve this.
- The controller holds a spinlock once per 1 second.  I don't
  know this is permissive or not, but the current scheduler
  doesn't hold any spinlocks normally, so...
