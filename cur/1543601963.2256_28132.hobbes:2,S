Some versions of glibc define prinf as a macro instead of a function.
That is quite legal but it stops you using #ifdef inside printf calls.
I will change ksymoops to work around that.

I believe that is a gcc bug.  The text is
            snprintf(map, size,
                     options->hex ? "<END_OF_CODE+%llx/????>"
                    : "<END_OF_CODE+%lld/????>",
                offset);
gcc is complaining about trigraphs but they are inside a string
constant, not in code.  IMHO gcc should not flag trigraphs in string
constants, report it as a gcc bug.
