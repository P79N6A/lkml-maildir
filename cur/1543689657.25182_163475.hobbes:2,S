A random example form one small unrelated program (gcc 3.2):
main:
        pushl   %ebp
        pushl   %edi
        pushl   %esi
        pushl   %ebx
        subl    $32, %esp
        xorl    %ebp, %ebp
        cmpl    $1, 52(%esp)
        movl    $0, 20(%esp)
        movl    $1000000, %edi      <----
        movl    $1000000, 16(%esp)  <----
        movl    $0, 12(%esp)
        movl    $.LC27, 8(%esp)
        je      .L274
        movl    $1, %esi
        cmpl    52(%esp), %esi
        jge     .L272
No sane human will do that.
main:
        pushl   %ebp
        pushl   %edi
        pushl   %esi
        pushl   %ebx
        subl    $32, %esp
        xorl    %ebp, %ebp
        cmpl    $1, 52(%esp)
        movl    $0, 20(%esp)
        movl    $1000000, %edi
        movl    %edi, 16(%esp)	<-- save 4 bytes
        movl    %ebp, 12(%esp)  <-- save 4 bytes
        movl    $.LC27, 8(%esp)
        je      .L274
        movl    $1, %esi
        cmpl    52(%esp), %esi
        jge     .L272
And this is only from a cursory examination.

You took marketspeak too seriously.

What gives you an impression that anyone is going to rewrite linux in asm?
I _only_ saying that compiler-generated asm is not 'good'. It's mediocre.
Nothing more. I am not asm zealot.
