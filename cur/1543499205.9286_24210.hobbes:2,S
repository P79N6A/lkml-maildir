I have seen numerous crashes on kernels 2.2.x kernels (mostly 2.2.9 and
2.2.10) all in function:
c011e270 T kfree
Has anyone else been seeing this?  It is very apparent on our nameservers
(happens every 4-24 hours or so), and less frequent, but still happening
on other servers.  All machines are RH5.2 based (all updates).
Just curious if others are having crashes that point to kfree in the
System.map?
