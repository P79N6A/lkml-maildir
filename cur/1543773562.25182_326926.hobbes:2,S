Are there any known problems with iptables ?
I see strange things.
When I use bittorrent (azureus or bittorrent-gui), at the same time as
iptables (for nat and internet access for my ibook), when I stop a download
or exit from one of this apps my external network goes down. 
I have tried the same without iptables loaded and it works fine.
If someone has any idea about this, I could give more details.
Kernel: every -mm since time ago.
External net: 1Mb cable through 3c59x, dhcp
Internal net: e1000
Iptables setup:

eth's:
alias eth0 3c59x
alias eth1 e1000
alias eth2 ne2k-pci
alias eth3 eth1394
eth2 and eth3 are currently down, not even the module is loaded.
Any idea ?
