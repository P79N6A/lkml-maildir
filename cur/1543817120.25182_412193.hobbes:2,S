Dear all,
I am doing the following in a kernel thread :
===== code segment=====
prink("before mdelay:%d, ", jiffies);
mdelay(300); // delay 300ms
printk("after mdelay:%d\n", jiffies);
===== code segment=====
However, jiffies before and after doing mdelay are the same!!!
Can someone please explain why jiffies doesn't change ?
Cheers,
