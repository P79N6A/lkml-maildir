HI all
I got this module from the net (binary version)
acx100_pci.o wanna be a linux driver from the TI acx100 chipset.
but it doesn't work at all!
- First ifconfig SegFault 
- Second hangs the machine
I did modinfo on this module and I got:
 $ modinfo acx100_pci.o
filename:    acx100_pci.o
description: "TI ACX100 WLAN 22Mbps driver"
author:      "Lancelot Wang"
license:     "GPL"
 $
Someone has the source code or know the author ?
