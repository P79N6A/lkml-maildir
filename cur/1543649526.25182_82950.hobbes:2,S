My bad. In this case, what I thought of as sane:

Is not. Touching a page entails reading it. In Albert's procps with 2.5.44,
bi and bo are reversed. Rik's vmstat does report things correctly.
Because I saw vmstat sometimes being right and sometimes being wrong, I
derived that is was the kernel that was at fault.
Perhaps Albert's procps isn't ready for 2.5.44?
