As I suspected, 2.2.18 + all the NFS/NFSd/SunRPC changes present in 
2.2.19pre10 locks up with wait_on_bh as soon as I run ls -lR on a large 
NFS directory tree, while at the same time pummeling the network and the 
local disks.
NFS is not enough to trigger the bug, the extra disk/network stress *is*
necessary. The network stress actually seems to be enough, I just 
triggered the bug again...
2.2.18 vanilla is fine.
So I guess the next round is in Trond's court. :-)
Thanks,
Ion
