It seems trivial to keep the last key you were given and do a quick
memcmp in your setkey method to see if it's different from the last
key you pushed to hardware, and set a flag if it is.  Then only do
your set_key() if you have a new key to pass to hardware.
I'm assuming the expense is in the aes_write() calls, and you could
avoid them if you know you're not writing something new.
