Btw., why is temperature conversion done twice? First time in kernel 
space and then with the help of sensors.conf again in user space?
Wouldn't it be much nicer to move this to the drivers? So there would be 
no need anymore to do this in userspace and one could rely on the values
found in sysfs?!
