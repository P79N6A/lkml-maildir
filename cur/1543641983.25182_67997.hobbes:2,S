I wonder if the right answer isn't to just make things like "__u64" be
"long long" even on 64-bit architectures (at least those on which it is 64
bit, of course. I _think_ that's true of all of them). And then just use 
"llu" for it all.
Of course, the really _best_ option would be to have gcc's printf string 
format be extensible and dynamic.
Davem, is sparc64 "long long" 64-bit?
