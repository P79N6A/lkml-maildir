Pulled.
Two notes:
1) ARP and FIB hacks need similar treatment
2) I don't think it's so nice to snprintf() onto the
   stack and then seq_printf() that in fib_node_seq_show.
   You should be able to keep the line within it's
   limit length just by specifying lengths to the integer
   formats.
Thanks.
