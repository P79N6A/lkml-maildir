I don't see where admin is mentioned in that scenario, but anyway: if you
are creating a file with sensible information - why the heck would you
make it world-readable in the first place? chmod on a directory might be a
good idea, but chmod 600 on the file is exactly what you need if you want
to stop other people from touching that file. What's that complex about
the idea that permissions on file are there to protect file contents?
The only case when admin is involved (aside of applying clue-by-four to
participants of the story) is when admin uses root for such data. I.e. 
uses root for no good reason. IMO "luser with root" is perfectly accurate
in that case.
