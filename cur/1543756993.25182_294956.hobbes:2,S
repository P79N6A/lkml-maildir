That would indicate either XFS dropped the IO completion for a
metadata buffer, or the driver didn't pass it back to us.  Hard
to say which; is this with default mkfs options?  If so, try
using -ssize=4k at mkfs time, that'll get rid of some of the
more unusual IO patterns which XFS can send down.  Also try a
blocksize the same as the pagesize (16K there I would guess).
If the behaviour changes, these'll give us pointers and help
isolate where the problem is.
cheers.
