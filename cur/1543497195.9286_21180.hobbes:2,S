Hello,
1) foo() does not terminate.
2) foo() eats an automatic sizeof(int) Meg each call. Never released since
no foo call ever exits.
 I suspect you have about 1.5 Gig VM+RAM on this system.
The OS can't really spot pathological programs for you. I imagine it hangs
because it has noplace left to run.
Regards
Tom

Please try the following:
-------------------------------------
# include "stdio.h"
static int count = 0;
# define MAX (1024*1024)
void foo(){
  char a[MAX];
  int i;
  printf ("%d\n", count++);
  for (i = 0; i < MAX; i += 100) {
    a[i] = i % 256;
  }
  foo();
}
int main(){
  foo();
  return 0;
}
-------------------------------------
after printing 375, the system stops as described in my problem report.
