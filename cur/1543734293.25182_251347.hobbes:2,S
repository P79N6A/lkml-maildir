Thats actually the easy case. We don't care if it takes another 30th of
a second to flip console. The hard one Jon was trying to point out is
a dual head card. Head 0 has someone running bzflag, head 1 has someone
editing an open office document. You have one accelerator set for both
heads. At that point you do care about the switch over, but the drivers
can co-operate for it. So it would always work, but it would work better
with friendly drivers when there is a need to do so.

fglrx stomps blindly on everything including your AGP. Not much we can
do about it.

You assume someone else crapped on the hardware. That is how DRI works
for example. You have multiple rendering clients each of which when it
takes the lock finds out if it was the last user (thats one thing Linus
sketch lacked but is easy to add).
My code ends up looking like
	lock
	if(someone_else_used_it)
		restore_my_state()
	blah 
	unlock
