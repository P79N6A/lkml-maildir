Fabio,
Any chance you can isolate further where this broke by finding the
latest release where it worked properly?
ie. does vanilla 2.6.3 work if you back out the mm patch?
If 2.6.3 works, then I'd be interested if the following 2.6.3 patch
breaks it:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/release/2.6.3/acpi-20040116-2.6.3.diff.gz
If 2.6.3 fails, does 2.6.2 work?
If 2.6.2 works, I'd be interested if either of the following break it:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/release/2.6.2/acpi-20040211-2.6.2.diff.bz2
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/release/2.6.2/acpi-20040116-2.6.2.diff.gz
This will tell us if the most recent ACPI changes are causing this
failure, or if it is something else.
thanks,

ps, note that you can recover the original source tree by using patch -R
on the patch that you applied.
