Sure, but we're not necessarily looking for a system that behaves
normally in all aspects. The example given was that of a paranoid
network server that does all its initialisation in a normal environment,
and then does a chroot to its data directory. Or alternatively, forks
after accepting a connection, and the child does a chroot. No need to be
able to exec other programs, etc. Such a daemon is certainly possible,
as I've written one myself. But it had to be started by root, rather
than by a normal user.
I'm not claiming that the user chroot patch is necessarily useful enough
to be included in the standard kernel - merely that it does have some
real-world uses.
