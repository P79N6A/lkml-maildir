This product (35GB ATAPI/USB2.0 removable disks billed as a tape-replacement
device) was just released yesterday (with Windows-only drivers, of course),
but an (old, from Comdex '03) article [0] stated that:
	"Linux drivers are definitely in the works. While many software companies
	suffer from advanced cases of recto-cranial syndrome when it comes to
	Linux drivers, releasing only binary drivers, or playing games, Iomega
	told me they weren't going to do that. When pressed, they said the drivers
	would be open sourced, and built with the help of the community. They are
	looking forward to helping improve the UDF file system when they hit walls
	with their hardware."
However, google and lkml searches reveal no information in this regard.
Is anyone here familiar with Iomega's development efforts for a linux driver?
Or, does anyone have any other information about the device itself, and how it
will likely fit into the kernel (compression in HW? etc)?
CC's to me are appreciated.
Thanks,
-will
