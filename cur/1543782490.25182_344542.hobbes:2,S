As Andi said, hugepages might be a very nice feature for you guys
to look into and might potentially give a performance increase with
reduced TLB pressure, not only your immediate fork problem.
Anyway, the attached patch is something you could try testing. If
you do so, then I would be very interested to see performance results.
Thanks,
Nick
