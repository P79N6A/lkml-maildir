    x86: Work around mmio config space quirk on AMD Fam10h
    Some broken devices have been discovered to require %al/%ax/%eax registers
    for MMIO config space accesses.  Modify mmconfig.c to use these registers
    explicitly (rather than modify the global readb/writeb/etc inlines).
    AK: also changed i386 to always use eax
    AK: moved change to extended space probing to different patch
    AK: reworked with inlines according to Linus' requirements.
    AK: improve comments.
