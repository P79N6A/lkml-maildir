Then entry in Configure.help for CONFIG_BLK_DEV_3W_XXXX_RAID starts
out "3ware is the only hardware ATA-Raid product in Linux to date."
This is a mistake, since the driver for the Adaptec 2400A card
(dpt_i2o) is in the kernel.
I've included a patch below to fix that, plus add a note about a data
corruption issue that users should be aware of.  I suppose the entry
should probably also include the standard "If you want to compile this
driver as a module..." block also...
On a side note, shouldn't CONFIG_BLK_DEV_3W_XXXX_RAID really be
something like CONFIG_SCSI_3W_XXXX_RAID?

 3ware Hardware ATA-RAID support
 CONFIG_BLK_DEV_3W_XXXX_RAID
-  3ware is the only hardware ATA-Raid product in Linux to date.
-  This card is 2,4, or 8 channel master mode support only.
-  SCSI support required!!!
+  This driver supports the 3ware Escalade 5000, 6000, and 7000-series
+  IDE RAID controllers.
+
+  Note that RAID 5 on 6000-series controllers requires a recent
+  firmware revision.  Running old firmware or old versions of the
+  driver on a degraded RAID 5 array can cause data corruption on the
+  array.  See 3ware's web site for firmware updates.
