I haven't seen any more e-mail traffic on this topic so I'm assuming
that the ball has been dropped.  Please excuse me if an acceptable patch
has been submitted that I wasn't CC'd on. 
Here is cleaned up version of Ed's patch that I believe addresses Dave's
stylistic concerns applies the relevant changes to both x86 & x86_64.
