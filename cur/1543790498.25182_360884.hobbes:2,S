        Which means you need to ask some Debian people and not
the Linux kernel developers directly.
        Generally speaking I have no troubles using make-kpkg
from the Debian package kernel-package to build my own custom
kernels, Debian packaged third-party modules (such as the nVidia
drivers) and non-packaged modules such as the VMware modules.
        But if you want to talk about it any further, reply to me
off list or in a Debian based forum as this is not the place for
a discussion that is Debian specific.
