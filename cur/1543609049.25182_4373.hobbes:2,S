Let me guess, IDE disks?  Anyway, this is a FAQ.  Go www.namesys.com, click
on the FAQ, and look at #15.
This issue really can be a problem as the entire machine will freeze up for
a good chunk of time while the disk churns away.  Strangely enough, I've
only noticed it on some machines, not all.  But it's enough of a problem to
cause me to switch to ext3.
