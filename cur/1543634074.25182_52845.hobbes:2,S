Actually, you have to use sg for a disc as well since you send a scsi CDB 
directly to the device for inquiry page 0x83.

Oh no question.  The way the current code doing this works is that it opens 
all scsi devices and issues a GET_IDLUN to compile a database of the nodes and 
then matches them up to sg nodes.
