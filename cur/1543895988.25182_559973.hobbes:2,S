I just tested this using lo instead of the 10GbE adapter.  I found similar 
results.  Since this makes it reproducible by just about anybody (maybe the 
only factor now is the number of CPUs), I have attached the script that I 
test things with.
So with the script run like ./stream_test 127.0.0.1 on 2.6.21 and 
2.6.21.5-rt17 I got the following:
2.6.21
