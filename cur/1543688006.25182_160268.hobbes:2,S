Takao,
I doubt that there will be that option in the 2.4 stable series.  I think
you are trying to fix the problem without understanding the entire picture.
If there is too much pagechache, then the kernel developers need to know
about your workload so that they can fix it.  But you have to try -aa first
to see if it's already fixed.

Exactly.  Every program you have opened, and all of its libraries will show
up as pagecache memory also, so seeing a large pagecache in and of itself
may not be a problem.
Let's get past the tuning paramenter you want in /proc, and tell us more
about what you are doing that is causing this problem to be shown.
