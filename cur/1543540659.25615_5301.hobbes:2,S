Open case, remove BP6, chuck through window.
More usefully, it seems to be reasonably stable if you:
1. Don't use X
2. Don't use an AGP video card
3. KEEP IT COOL (i.e. if the room isn't 72F put a fan on the BX)
4. Upgrade the bios to the newest revision
5. Don't overclock (duh)
6. Don't use the HPT66 controler.
