That is only a stop gap then. I don't see this being
generally true in the future. e.g. Intel announced SMT will be soon 
back so even a standard dual core would exceed it with
current southbridges.
Also I'm not sure but I suspect non Intel HPETs have less than
three timers. Certainly they generally miss the 64bitness.
