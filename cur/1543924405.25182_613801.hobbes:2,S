Actually, what causes problems here is something between a bug and a  
feature in libc's buffering.  Basically the -EINVAL error causes libc  
to leave its data in the file-output buffer despite the file being  
closed and reopened. Since a standalone echo just exits that buffer  
is discarded, but for the bash builtin it hangs around in the buffer  
for a while and ends up getting prepended to the following echo  
statement.  There's actually multiple ways to make this fail; this is  
just the simplest.
