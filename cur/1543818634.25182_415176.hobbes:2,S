Well we had the problem with i2c-viapro and vi686a. Best solution was
to fail from the probe function - like this:
         /* Always return failure here.  This is to allow other drivers to bind
          * to this pci device.  We don't really want to have control over the
          * pci device, we only wanted to read as few register values from it.
          */
         return -ENODEV;
release_region:
         release_region(vt596_smba, 8);
         return error;
}

This is good ;)
