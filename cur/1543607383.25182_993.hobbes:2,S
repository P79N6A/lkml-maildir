As I see it, that is exactly what should not be done. Lets suppose you are
running 2.4.12. You want to upgrade. So you unpack 2.4.13 and build it.
If you go now to build nVidia drivers, with the shipped Makefile they
still build and install against 2.4.12. Sou you have to reboot in runlevel
3 to have 2.4.13 running witoht X, and then install the driver. *grrr*
With the above change, you build your kernel, then you go to the nVidia
sources, build the driver and install on the proper 2.4.13 dir under
/lib/modules, and just reboot in X again.
About /usr/src/linux, what is not recommended is to symlink
/usr/include/asm -> /usr/src/linux/include/asm
/usr/include/linux -> /usr/src/linux/include/linux
but instead have a separate header package that installs under /usr/include.
