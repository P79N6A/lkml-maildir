This fixes it, thank you very much!  I am currently running 2.5.68 with your 
IDE patch.  One annoyance is that the order of IDE channels is different 
between 2.4.20 and 2.5.68 - the Silicon Image SATA controller is detected 
first on 2.5 but not on 2.4.  I've just put a simple script to swap 
/etc/fstab at boot based on the running kernel, but the device swap is not 
very user-friendly.  Other than that, I've got no complaints - the system is 
running quite well!
