Hm. My copy of efibootmgr has:
typedef struct _efi_variable_t {
        efi_char16_t  VariableName[1024/sizeof(efi_char16_t)];
        efi_guid_t    VendorGuid;
        uint64_t         DataSize;
        uint8_t          Data[1024];
        efi_status_t  Status;
        uint32_t         Attributes;
} __attribute__((packed)) efi_variable_t;
which certainly makes it look like it's expecting a 64-bit value. But 
checking the spec does seem to suggest that datasize is a native value, 
so presumably it's an efibootmgr bug rather than a kernel one? In that 
case, this ought to be dropped.
