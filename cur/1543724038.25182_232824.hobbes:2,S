No it's not.
I'm sorry that you are such a K&R-C bigot that you don't like type 
checking. But the kernel DOES like type checking, and the kernel is not 
K&R C. The kernel uses strict ANSI, and in fact, is _more_ strict than 
ANSI C is in many many ways.
One of the "strict typechecking" rules is that you don't mix integers and 
pointers by mistake. The fact that C allows dual usage of the integer "0"
is an anachronism that should have been fixed long ago.
Final word: K&R C without prototypes etc is still "legal C". That doesn't
make it legal kernel code.
