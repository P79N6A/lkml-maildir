I can see from the crash report that the fault happens. I want to 
understand why.
I can use workarounds. (Calling sys_foo() directly from module can be a 
problem -- I would have to know the "versioned"  function name or the 
address of the function within the kernel space.  Calling an entry from 
the syscall table is much easier.)
