Initial Post (Wed, 17 Aug 2005)
This patch moves the
	if (! pte_none(*pte))
		hugetlb_clean_stale_pgtable(pte);
logic into huge_pte_alloc() so all of its callers can be immune to the bug
described by Kenneth Chen at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/6/16/246

Unless I am missing something, it seems more correct to place the check inside
huge_pte_alloc() to prevent a the same bug wherever a huge pte is allocated.
It also allows checking for this condition when lazily faulting huge pages
later in the series.
