reiser4 is using approximately twice the CPU percentage, but completes
in approximately half the time, therefore it uses about the same
amount of CPU time at the others.
Therefore on a loaded system, with a load carefully chosen to make the
test CPU bound rather than I/O bound, one could expect reiser4 to
complete in approximately the same time as the others, _not_ slowest.
That's why it's misleading to draw conclusions from the CPU percentage alone.

reiser4 literature claims that it does less IO (wandering logs) and
suggests better seek patterns (deferred allocation).

Indeed.  Even sync() is not guaranteed to flush the data to disk in
its final form, if the filesystem state is already committed to the
journal.
