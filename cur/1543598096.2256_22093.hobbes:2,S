As I promised a few days ago I have just released the newest 
version of our NBD swap patches for Linux-2.2.19.
You can find them together with the NBD swap server and
client source code under the following URL:
<
ftp://ftp.xss.co.at/pub/Linux/NBD/nbdswap-1.2-1.tar.gz>
It works for us, and we think it works reasonably well.
YMMV, though. Please check it out and tell us what you
think. We would really like to see something like this
to be included in Linux-2.5.
Suggestions, improvements and ideas are welcome.
Regards,
