There is another patch which round the bd->props.brightness to the
nearest but larger acceptable brightness level.
Please refer to 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9277
I have no obvious objection on either of these two proposals.
But one thing to mention is that
both of these two patches is written on the assumption that the
brightness levels listed in _BCL method are in ascending order, while
this is not stated in the ACPI spec.
Is this a problem?
Thanks,
Rui
