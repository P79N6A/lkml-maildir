100 was just an arbitrary number that seems to be fine in my current
tests. But yes, a function trace over a thousand tasks will clean them
out. But the recording is only done when a trace is active.

One thing I planned on doing was at a low path point (hit max latency to
record, etc) we could copy the array into the trace buffer, so the info
stays with the trace.
Going with your approach (marker at exit), I could flush the traces that
were saved, as well as the comms of the current tasks that are still
running. The thing is, this all starts to get a bit intrusive into the
rest of the kernel.  What is suppose to be a compact latency tracer,
starts to become larger, problematic, entity. Now changes in exit could
require updates to the tracer. Which is something I want to avoid.
