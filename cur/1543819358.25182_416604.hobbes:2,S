Jon, if you have the time and two available machines, I would still be
interested if there is a firmware_revision logged by sbp2 when it logs
in into a Powerbook in target disk mode.
(Remember to unload/reload sbp2 with "modprobe sbp2
force_inquiry_hack=1" on the machine which is running Linux; sbp2 would
not print that log message otherwise. There will also be no log message
if the Powerbook's firmware does not generate a firmware_revision entry
in the first place, as has been reported by iBook owners.)
TIA,
