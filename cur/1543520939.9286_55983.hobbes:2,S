Byte magazine had a really good article about Y2K and things like Y2038 and
stuff, it even had a whole time-line about what kind of OS/processor would
crash when. Too bad I can't find it anywhere, but I think it must have been
in the July issue of 1998. I think I'll go take a look at their website and
see if I can find it.
Oh BTW, IIRC the Y2038 isn't just a linux issue, it's an issue for a lot of
UNIX systems. But you had figured that allready I guess ;)
