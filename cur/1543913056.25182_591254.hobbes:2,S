i'd just describe it as "Blackfin on-chip NAND" rather than sticking
in exact part numbers as i imagine we can extend it down the line

should mention the module name when built as a module

rather than advertising this, i'd just keep it in the driver ...
presumably there are anomaly #'s for when the ECC is wrong, so we can
make the code depend on those
