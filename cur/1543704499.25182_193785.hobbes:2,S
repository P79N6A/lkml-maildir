originaly i read this on the Kernelmessages console (alt+F10)
but i also tried it as root.... the same...
i've never installed the default kernel. The athlond kernel was installed from 
the beginning. If i make a symlink in this folder that points to the 
modules.dep in the 2.6.1 dir. then it works. But i guess that isn't a clean 
solution.....
fu*** suse or stupid user ?? :-P
