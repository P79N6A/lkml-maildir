Indeed. But that interface doesn't exist yet...

Right. I suspect you'll find a similar goofs in lots of drivers if you
go looking. I intend to go through all the drivers I care about and see
if I can tighten up the clock management a bit. There are probably a
few missing or half-assed suspend/resume implementations around too.
