Fair enough.  I see that for the bitmap index in particular.
I suppose a small amount of memory could be saved by noting that, as
some parts of a not-really-aligned zone are never allocated, those parts
of the bitmap don't have to exist.
Slightly different topic: I think I see a bug.  This code in
free_pages_ok:
     map_nr &= mask;
...
             buddy = list(map_nr ^ -mask);
...
             mask <<= 1;
...
             map_nr &= mask;
map_nr here is relative to the first page in mem_map, whichever zone is
used.  That means the first page in mem_map had better have as much
alignment as any zone, otherwise the masking operations on map_nr aren't
going to work nicely at all.  This only affects the folks who are asking
about systems with memory that doesn't start at address zero.
enjoy,
