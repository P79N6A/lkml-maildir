Last time I checked, yes. Callbacks should be sent only when the file is
closed.

But local modification are per definition more up-to-date because you
haven't closed the file yet. It is very much a problem of how you do
your caching. I'm trying to tell you AFS has a well defined consistency
model called session semantics. That directly influenzes every decision
you make wrt. to caching and everything I've seen up until now shows me
that you're simply implementing an NFS client that happens to speak to
AFS servers.

Actually AFS is most definitely a stateful filesystem and as such has
the concept of an open file.
Just google for "AFS NFS stateful stateless" and you get literally
hundreds of handouts and lecture notes from distributes systems classes
that describe exactly these differences. UNIX/session semantics,
stateless/stateful, etc.

Yes. If the user hasn't opened the file before, we have to check the
permissions with the server. So every user that opens the same file will
generate an "open" rpc to the server.

First of all, typical write-write sharing is extremely low, otherwise
Coda wouldn't have even worked with it's optimistic replication and
caching. Second of all permission changes are even rarer.
So on the off chance that a write-write shared file on happens to be
affected by a permission change.
- We either succeed in writing the file when the person who lost access
  closed before the last writer who still had access. Big deal, he had
  access when he opened the file, and it is next to impossible to tell
  wheter his close arrived before or after the permission was taken away
  except when every operation is somehow given an absolute linear
  ordering in time. Generally too expensive on a distributed system
  with clients that may come and go as they please.
- Or the person who lost access is the last one to close the file and
  trigger the writeback. In this case the servers will deny the write
  operation and the client will declare a conflict on that object and
  switch to disconnected mode. Someone who has write permission can
  repair the conflict.

Like I said in the section you quoted yourself, the last writer who
closes the file.

Actually, for any unmodified data there is only one copy. Once it is
modified there are two (the dirty page and the logged change), why would
there be a third, I don't care about the copy in the backing file...
It has the advantage that even if you pull the powercord, we can still
recover the last consistent set of metadata and from that validate both
the data in the cache files, and revalidate everything against the
servers, which we already need for the disconnected operation.
