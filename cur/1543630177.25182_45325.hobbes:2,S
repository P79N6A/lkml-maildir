Subject: [PATCH] 3/6: 64 bit process start times
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/5/11/43

Bump up the start_time value of processes to 64 bit. This actually is overkill,
since "borrowing" a few bits from some other variable would suffice.
I just didn't know were to steal them and how to make access less ugly then.
Without this patch, processes that survive 32 bit jiffies wraparound are
reported as having started in the future.
