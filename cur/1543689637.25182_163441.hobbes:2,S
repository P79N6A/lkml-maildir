I encountered the same thing with device_mode.
As a side note, I've been lurking here for a while and I've noticed that
the latest iterations (although I've only tried Nick's once, in -mm5) of
_both_ schedulers feel great on my system. If I've been following the
thread correctly, I think the turning point was the addition of some I/O
scheduler patches (in mm3 or mm4?). Way better since then.
