That reminds me - we should increment the rss for page directories now on
the allocation path, because we will decrement rss for them when we free
them (and because it's the right thing to do anyway, I guess - better
resource tracking).
The other alternative is to make separate versions of "tlb_remove_page()":
one that decrements RSS, one that doesn't (and the latter would be used
for page directories).
Finally, I haven't really heard anything back from the "strange" VM
architectures (ie sparc v8 and PPC) other than Davem's buy-in that the
basic approach should work ok for them.
