So you've got an administration port that ignores the firewall
facilities on the machine. Now tell me why anyone would buy such a
product ? What if your firmware has a network layer bug, what if someone
finds a security hole in it ?
If you want to steal ports from under the OS then you need your own IP
address and full network stack, not the one assigned to the Linux
system.
