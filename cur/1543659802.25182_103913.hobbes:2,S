I asked 1 week ago if the system BIOS does PS/2 keyboard emulation.
I think you are saying here that it does, so I'll try to confirm that:
Does the USB keyboard work when talking to BIOS Setup?
Does the USB keyboard work if NO Linux USB drivers are loaded?
Or are you using the USB keyboard only by having Linux USB drivers
loaded?
I posted a patch to 2.4.20 on 2002-Dec-04 that might work for you.
It's available at
  
http://www.osdl.org/archive/rddunlap/patches/kbc_option_2420.patch
It might work for you.  If you try it out, please let me know how it
does for you.
