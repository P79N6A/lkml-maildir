Done.

Playing with routing table and using arp_filter.
Or using the hidden patch.
Or using a tool for filtering arp as iparp or netfilter/arpfilter.
IMHO "hidden" is the simpliest (provided it's compiled in the kernel).

Sure it's... I have never said it's wrong, I only say that its
behaviour is different to other OS and it's NOT usual.
And on certain scenaries it could be a desired behaviour.

Problem is that linux is unable to behave like the other OS and systems
do in a simple way.
The easy way is the "hidden" patch, if it's applied in the kernel.
