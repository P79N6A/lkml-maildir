I think we should ditch the negative export completely - it was a bad idea in
the first place. (I'm allowed to say that without any attempt at diplomacy - it
was my idea.)
We can pass the whole request up to mountd, and if it's to be refused, then
mountd can change the rq_proc to a special procedure which always returns
ESTALE. After making the decision, be it either yes or no, mountd just sticks
the request back in the kernel's incoming request queue, using the logic that
Olaf posted a couple of days ago. Then it either gets honoured, or just passes 
directly through to the ESTALE procedure.
I don't think any change in the filehandle should be necessary with this 
approach. Neither do I think it's necessary, or useful, to use RPC for the 
upcall. The netlink device provides exactly the functionality that we require 
with minimal overhead.

True, but this issue is the one that kept biting me with the highest 
frequency, so it's what I started working on.
I'm aware that in Linux development, handwaving is generally ignored, so I 
took a couple of days to throw together a quick example of what I wanted to 
do. It wasn't my intention for it to get merged into HJ's release so quickly - 
I just wanted people to listen when I said 'we should do it like _this_'.
Until we _have_ sorted out the problems with my approach, unless we can do so
fairly promptly, it might be appropriate to revert those changes, or to 
declare that the 1.5 branch is a development branch, and continue to maintain 
the 1.4 branch in parallel.
