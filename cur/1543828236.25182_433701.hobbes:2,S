Hi,
This is a rather complex issue, to the point that your patch is not
sufficient actually. While it will create a core file, it's not really a
good one, and there are some nasty other issues with it (esp on 64 bit
systems). The enterprise distro kernels have a more complete patch for
this (I'm pretty sure both RH and SUSE have fundamentally the same patch
for this), if you really want this functionality I suggest getting the
patch from either of those distros to get the full thing (there's some
security angle to this even iirc).
