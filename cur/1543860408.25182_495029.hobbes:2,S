Do you mean "in-memory inode"  or "memory node(pglist_data)" by "memory inode" ?

I guess that you are  wanting to do something to remove arch-dependent
code in swap subsystem.  Just like the pud introduced in the
page-table related codes. Is it right?
However, you should verify that your changes will not deteriorate
system performance. Also, you need to maintain it for a long time with
the evolution of mainline kernel before it is accepted.
Best regards
