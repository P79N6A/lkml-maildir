I believe that this fiber enabling can be done by defining config_init in the phy_driver struct.
struct phy_driver {
<snip>
        /* Called to initialize the PHY,
	 * including after a reset */
	int (*config_init)(struct phy_device *phydev);
<snip>
};
ie.
static struct phy_driver bcm5421s_driver = {
<snip>
	.config_init = bcm5421s_phy_config,
<snip>
};
int bcm5421s_phy_config(struct phy_device *phydev)
{
...
	/* enable fiber mode here... */
...
}
