I think that's muru.com/linux/dyntick ?
I'm not sure what Thomas's patch will do for me - here's what I currently have:
% cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power 
active state:            C2
max_cstate:              C8
bus master activity:     00000000
states:
    C1:                  type[C1] promotion[C2] demotion[--] latency[000] usage[00000010]
   *C2:                  type[C2] promotion[--] demotion[C1] latency[050] usage[01314979]
Near as I can tell, we start off in C1, drop into C2, and stay there no
matter what happens - we never move back up to C1, and there's no C3 to drop
into....
Should there be a C3/C4?  Is my laptop just plain borked? :)
