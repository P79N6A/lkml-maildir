So send patches to udev.  You seem to be complaining, but not doing
any of the work to help the situation.  Views expressed in that
fashion generally don't get much consideration.  (Some, but not much.)

Debian's installer relies of devfs for historical reasons (it was too
hard to change without having sarge slip again for another year or
two); the system which is installed definitely does _not_ have to use
devfs, and _does_ ship with udev.  And the next version of Debian
(whenever it ships) will use something else.  See this URL in a
discussion filed regarding a _bug_ that was filed complaining that the
Debian installer was using devfs.

Not many.  If someone had been willing to put in the _concerted_,
long-term effort that has been put in by people like Greg K-H to
develop an alternative system, including submitting a patch to remove
the racy bits of devfs (not clear if anything would be left :-), then
we would be in a different place.  But we haven't, so we're not.  One
or two proposals to do work, without followup patches (and fixes to
the patches after people complain/criticize them) means that whoever
claimed they were willing to do maintainance work weren't serious.

Is waiting another year really going to help?  If devfs is doomed,
then might as well make a clean break now.  Otherwise we'll wait
another year, and then more people will come out of the woodwork,
whining and whining for another stay of execution....
