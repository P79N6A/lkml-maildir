Hi,
Lately I upgrade my Intel PII to a PIII and was surprised to see it was
not properly
recognized at boot time. I expected to see something like:
CPU: Intel PIII ....
But instead it prints:
<snip>
Calibrating delay loop... 448.92 BogoMIPS
Memory: 128080k/131008k available (952k kernel code, 412k reserved,
1524k data, 40k init)
CPU: Intel 00/07 stepping 02
Checking 386/387 coupling... OK, FPU using exception 16 error reporting.
Checking 'hlt' instruction... OK.
POSIX conformance testing by UNIFIX

After looking in setup.c I found out it could never print something with
PIII but shouldn't it at least print something like:
CPU: Intel PII (Des...)..??
Greetings,
Jurgen
