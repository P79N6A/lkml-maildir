Ok i think i may have not conveyed my meaning properly, my mistake. What i 
think would be better is if the architectures which have no-op 
acpi_unregister_gsi to declare them as static inline in header files. For 
architectures (such as ia64) which have a functional acpi_unregister_gsi, 
we can declare them in a .c file with the proper exports etc.
Thanks Kenji and sorry for the confusion.
