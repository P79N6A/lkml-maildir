24-rc2.  23 has no problem, as you know :)

Right.  I thought it somehow involved with other pv ops indirectly,
but it seems not.

Yes, that's possible.

Yes.  More over, there is no guarantee that this will be built
properly in the future.  It's a kind of coincident that the driver is
built.  If any non-paravirt implementation accesses an exported symbol
instead of inlining, then this won't work, too.

Agreed.
