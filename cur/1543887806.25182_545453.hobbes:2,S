You will definitely meet the same problem. As very large hardware disk
becomes more and more popular, this will become a big issue for software
raid.

my experiance is taht if you don't have CONFIG_LBD enabled then the
kernel will report the larger disk as 2G and everything will work, you
just won't get all the space.
plus he seems to be crashing around 500G of data
and finally (if I am reading the post correctly) if he configures the
drives as 4x2.2TB=11TB instead of 2x5.5TB=11TB he doesn't have the same
problem.
I'm getting ready to setup a similar machine that will have 3x10TB (3 15
disk arrays with 750G drives), but won't be ready to try this for a few
more days.
