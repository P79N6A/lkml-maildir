really nice! I'm quite sure that this is the right way to approach this 
problem.
Please add the appropriate lock_acquire()/lock_release() calls into the 
new sleeping semaphore type. Just use the parameters that rwlocks use:
#define rwlock_acquire(l, s, t, i)            lock_acquire(l, s, t, 0, 2, i)
#define rwlock_acquire_read(l, s, t, i)       lock_acquire(l, s, t, 2, 2, i)
and lockdep will allow recursive read-locking. You'll also need a 
lockdep_init_map() call to register the lock with lockdep. Then your 
locking scheme will be fully checked by lockdep too. (with your current 
code the new lock type is not added to the lock dependency graph(s))
