There is an easy, but probably not so obvious fix: do the things in
(interruptible_)sleep_on yourself in the right order.  There is no
prepackaged function doing that for you.
Take a look at these function's implementation to understand the
following example better.
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE > KERNEL_VERSION(2,3,0)
        DECLARE_WAITQUEUE(wait, current);
#else
        struct wait_queue wait;
        wait.task = current;
#endif
        add_wait_queue(&wait_queue, &wait);
        current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
                   /* or TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE */
        outb(ioport, 0xFF);  /* Ask for data */
        schedule();          /* Go to sleep (or not) */
        remove_wait_queue(&wait_queue, &wait); 
            /* Have a nice oops if you forget to remove */
	data = inb(ioport);  /* There you go */
 
This solves the problem by setting the state to sleep and only after
that to trigger the interrupt.  If the interrupt happens and
wake_up_interruptible() is called before the schedule() then
current->state will be TASK_RUNNING again and make schedule() return
immediately (or not, if it finds a better task to run).
