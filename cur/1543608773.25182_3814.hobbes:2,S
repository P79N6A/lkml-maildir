Sorry, I was just trying to make the driver consistent with
itself as it is now, rather than with how it will be after
you change it to support rescanning.
Please use those parts of patch #11 that seem okay to you, if any.
It's all "cleanup" stuff.  Note, though, that Christian Schmidt
asked that his e-mail address be changed.
