I'm guessing thie is 2.4.20-pre5?  If so can you try the following two
patches that I just sent off to Marcelo:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/usb/2.4/usb-usbserial-2.4.20-pre5.patch
and
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/usb/2.4/usb-pl2303-2.4.20-pre5.patch
and let me know if that solves the problem for you or not?
thanks,
greg k-h
