Let me add that as memory sized get larger, people are also looking
for more tlb coverage and less per page overhead.
Looks like ppc64 is getting 64K page support, at which point higher
order allocations (eg. for stacks) basically disappear don't they?
x86-64 I thought were also getting 64K page support but I can't
find a reference to it right now - at the very least I know Andi
wants to support larger soft pages for it.
ia64 is obviously already well covered.
