Johannes,
people do contribute to the em28xx project.
If noone keeps finding solutions for requirements I will of course
go on to find my own way.
Although upcoming and even the current requirements are not met
by the existing API.
It's worth nothing to merge what's available now since I'm not even
ok with how several issues are solved with the driver itself at the
moment.
I'm going forward step by step with it now.
there's also an active and even problem solving oriented ML available:
http://mcentral.de/pipermail/em28xx/
Also if you look at the mercurial code you'll see several people
contributing to that project.
Markus
