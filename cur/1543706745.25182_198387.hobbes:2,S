I think you're really wrong since "deeply nested" means exactly "unreadable 
and badly structured" and you could easily realize it by simply spending ~10 
hours per day coding and/or taking a look at the code written by someone 
which is not you. A simple use of inline functions and a previous thinking 
about what you're going to write could easily solve all problems.

No one is saying this line of code is the best one could imagine... have you
ever thought that maybe anything "floating around" that code line could be 
written in a not-well structured way?

A compiler should do it, a maintainer IMHO should not for a really simple 
reason: readability (which in most cases means maintainability too).

Not a good point.
