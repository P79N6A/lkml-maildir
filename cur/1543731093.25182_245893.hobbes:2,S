I prefer this one:
hepburn:/# mount
/dev/sda3 on / type reiser4 (rw)
hepburn:/# touch apa
hepburn:/# chmod +x apa
hepburn:/# cd apa
hepburn:/apa# ls
ls: reading directory .: Not a directory
So there is already file-as-dir with legacy "ls" - and it works just 
like people seem to want it to do with legacy apps. Not at all.
