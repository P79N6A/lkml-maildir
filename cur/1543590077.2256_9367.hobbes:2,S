I misread your previous email sorry, I think you meant to fsck using
rawio (not to move fsck into the kernel). You can do that just now but
to get decent performance then fsck should do self caching, changing
fsck to do self caching doesn't sound worthwhile either. Note also that
rawio has nothing to do with the pagecache.  Infact both rawio and
O_DIRECT bypasses all the pagecache and its smp locks for example.

Where the cache of the blockdevice lives is a completly orthogonal
problem with "why cached blockdevices are useful" which I addressed in
the previous email.

Last time I talked with the parted maintainer he was asking for that
feature so that parted won't need to do its own anti-oom management in
userspace, so he can simple mmap(MAP_SHARED) a quite large region of
metadata of the blockdevice, read/write to the mmaped region and the
kernel will take care of doing paging when it runs low on memory. right
now it allocates the metadata in anonymous memory and loads it via
read(). This memory will need to be swapped out if the working set
doesn't fit in ram (and swap may not be available ;).

Being able to fsck a live filesystem is yet another exotic feature and
yes for that you would certainly need some additional kernel support.
