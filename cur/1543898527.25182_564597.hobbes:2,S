The MAC address in /etc/iftab matches that of the card. However, there
are three rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules dealing
with eth0 - eth2, they state MAC addresses which don't match. I
certainly didn't put them there. Does udev change its own config?
I will have to check the success when i'm back on location. No use in
decativating the NIC in a ssh session ;-)
Thanks for the hint,
