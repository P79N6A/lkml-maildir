OK, thanks.
Is the following correct?
Before:
 if (!(entry = create_proc_entry("prof_cpu_mask", 0600, root_irq_dir)))
After:
entry = create_proc_entry("prof_cpu_mask", 0600, root_irq_dir)
if (!entry)
BTW, how can i compile only the profile.c file?
I would like to verify that my changes (now I'm at total: 2 errors, 1
warnings, 599 lines checked)
doesn't impact on the compiled code?
Thanks.
