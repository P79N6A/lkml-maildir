I came up with this.  Separate output directory option is untested.
It's not quite what you wanted but this is as close as I could get.
#!/bin/bash
#
#	scripts/makei
#
# Make .i files in Linux kernel tree.  You must first build a
# working kernel so this script knows which files to make.
#
# usage:
#	scripts/makei [subdir]
#
#	Use the optional subdir parameter to build .i files
#	for just part of the source tree.
#
# Set the shell variables MAKE and OBJDIR if necessary.
#
#   Examples
#	If:
#		Your output dir is ~/build,
#		you are building the UML arch
#		and you only want to build .i files in drivers/base/
#	Then use:
#		OBJDIR=~/build MAKE='make O=~/build ARCH=um' scripts/makei drivers/base
OBJDIR=${OBJDIR:=.}
MAKE=${MAKE:=make}
OBJDIR=${OBJDIR%/}/
find $OBJDIR$1 -type f -name \*.o |
while read fullname
do
	fullname=${fullname#$OBJDIR}
	name=${fullname%.o}
	[ -f $name.c -o -f $name.S ] && $MAKE $name.i
done
