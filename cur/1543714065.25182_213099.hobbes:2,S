Subject: want to clarify powerpc assembly conventions in head.S and entry.S

I'm doing some work in head.S and entry.S, and I just wanted to make 
sure that I had the conventions down.
According to the docs I read, r0 and r3-12 are caller-saves.  They seem 
to be saved in EXCEPTION_PROLOG_2 (head.S) and restored in 
ret_from_except() (entry.S).  Thus, if I add code in entry.S I should be 
able to use any of those registers, without having to worry about 
restoring them myself--correct?
Also, I'm a bit confused about the three instances of the following line 
in entry.S:
	stwcx.	r0,0,r1			/* to clear the reservation */
I don't see the corresponding lwarx instruction.  What reservation is it 
referring to?
Thanks,
Chris
