You may _never_ under any circumstances sleep outside of process context
(when int_count is non-zero on 2.0 or in_interrupt() returns true in 2.2).
Sleeping includes the forceful act of sleeping (ex. schedule()) and
anything that has the potential to sleep, such as non-atomic memory
allocation.
You will need to find a different way to accomplish what you are trying to
do.  If you need to perform an action at a later point, you can try a
kernel timer.  If you only need to wait for a minute amount of time, you
can busy wait (such as udelay).
