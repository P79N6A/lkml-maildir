Actually, they are. It's just that the "testing" directory gets cleaned up
every once in a while, and they are moved to "testing/old/v2.3"

One of the changes in -test4 is the memory pressure algorithms. It may be
that it's an old bug that is just made visible by different memory
pressure patterns. That would be the nightmare case.
The good case is that once it gets narrowed down to a particular
test-kernel, the bug is just obvious.
Fingers crossed.
