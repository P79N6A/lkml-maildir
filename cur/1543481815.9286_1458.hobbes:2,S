I'm experiencing the same problem. Sometimes when playing mp3 tunes my box
will suddenly freeze without any error messages and I have to push the evil
reset button.
I never had any problems with playing mp3 files under the 2.0.x kernels,
and I played > 4000 of them (running a cgi based jukebox)

Yes, that's a sure way to do it (I'm not using that Netscape fix posted
recently)
My setup is 2.2.0-pre9, gcc 2.7.2.3, glibc 2.0.7 
Hardware: pent 200, ide, awe64 as soundcard, software raid1, ne2kpci NIC,
no SMP, aic-2920 with 4 7-cd-changers attached (I get the freeze also when
playing the mp3 files from harddisk...)
I have modularized almost everything I could, using kmod to load the
sounddrivers and everything.
