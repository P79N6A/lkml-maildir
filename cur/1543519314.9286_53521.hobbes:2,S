  Hi, all. Version 148 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This is against 2.3.33. Highlights of this release:
- Removed kmod support: use devfsd instead
- Moved miscellaneous character devices to /dev/misc
				Regards,
					Richard....
