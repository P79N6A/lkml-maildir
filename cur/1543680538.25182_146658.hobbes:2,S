You should access it through getcwd(2).  Try 'ls -al'. readdir has
special case for such directories (IS_DEADDIR), so it will come up as
empty without dot and dotdot.

system. File system may decide to remove dot and dotdot during rmdir, or
remove some of them, of leave everything to the final iput().
