I have no idea what X wants.  What non-X "action" games want is simple
(I have written a few): to know when the user is pushing particular keys.
Those games achieve this by observing a DOWN event when a key is
pressed, an UP when it is released, to change their knowledge of a key
state, and ignoring events which don't change their knowledge of the
state: auto-repeat DOWN events or spurious UP events.
