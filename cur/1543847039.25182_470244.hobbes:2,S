So what to do? GCC does not squawk, and instead has 
__attribute__((warn_unused_result)) in case someone should be made aware 
that a certain return value really needs to be examined.
Not even the Turbo C/C++ compiler from 1990 requires either of 
from/to-void* or to-void casts.

Ok, so the (void) can definitely go away for functions that actually 
return void, but what for the others? I am inclined that all lints 
should be fixed, or be sort-of discarded, since linting is slowly going 
back into [at least one] compiler.
