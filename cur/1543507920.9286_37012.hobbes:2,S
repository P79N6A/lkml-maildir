None of the common Intel chipsets support 66MHz PCI busses.  To the best
of my recollection, the only way to get a 66MHz PCI bus with Intel CPUs is
to buy one of the [ridiculously] expensive N way Xeon boxes.

It's PCI, plain and simple.  Remember that PCI runs a seperate cycle to
transfer the adress before using the bus to transfer data.  If you're
transfering data sequentially and the burst transfers are long enough,
then you can get closer to PCI's max bandwidth.  From the PCI spec, take
the following chart (for 66 MHz, double the numbers):
	Data Phases	Bandwidth (MB/s)
	     8             60
	    16             80
	    32             96
	    64            107

It sounds like the SGI is using a 66 MHz PCI bus.
