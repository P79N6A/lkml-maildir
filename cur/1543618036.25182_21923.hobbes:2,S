I see the mouse problem without hub.
So it could be a flaky mouse.
Is the fact that 'switching to the console and switching back to X
restore X' compatible with your idea ?
What sounds strange is that this appears only when CPU is mainly used by
others apps.
My idea is a timeout in X (without output : strange) due to a latency.
An important point here is that the mouse works fine with the 2.2 kernel
(I should have used 2.2.17 to 2.2.19).
