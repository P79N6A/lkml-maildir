I tried out the 2.6.16.16 kernel yesterday and it seems to have solved my problem.  The signifigant changes to sata_mv make the driver much more stable.

I'm affraid I can't help you much. Mark Lord works on getting the driver
stable on 2.6.16.x kernels. After that he wants to port forward the
changes.
FWIW, there is quite a big libata update which I assume goes into
2.6.17-rc4-mm2. Maybe that helps?
	With kind regards, Sander
