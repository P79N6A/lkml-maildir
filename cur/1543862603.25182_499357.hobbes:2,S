	I'm sorry if I missed your previous post.  I've never ignored a
configfs post on purpose :-)

	This is intentional.  The entire point of configfs is to have
the lifetime controlled from userspace.  If the kernel can pin things
however it likes, we lose that property.

	I don't quite see how this link relates, but perhaps I'm not
understanding your entire question.  Currently, ->make_item() doesn't
allow an error code because that would involve the ERR_PTR() construct.
While that construct is quite useful, I'm always wary of adding
complexity.  Thus, the tradeoff would have to be worth it.
	What would you like to signify with a ->make_item() error code?
I don't see how it 'checks' a type of sub-directory.  A particular
config_group can only create a particular type of sub-directory, so I'm
confused.  Maybe some more explanation of what you are trying to do will
help me understand.  Then I can see how configfs fits with your needs
and where it may not.

	Very simply, the lifetime must be in the control of userspace.
That's precisely the point of configfs.  If you'd like the kernel to
control the lifetime, I suspect sysfs will be more to your liking.
configfs is not meant to replace sysfs, merely to coexist for things
that benefit from the configfs model and not the sysfs model.

	Why does it need to be ordered?  Also, why can't the symlinks
have a naming convention of order?  Sure, someone hacking at it can
break that, but your tool that really does the work can create
objects/myobj1/params/param1 -> myparams2.  So the listing does have
meaning.  Just one possibility.

	Um, with the symlinks pinning the params, they'll not be
removed.  Unless you were creating a param_list without creating the
symlinks.

	There are two ways to reference the params.  One is to let the
userspace program ask for the reference via symlink.  The other is in
your driver.  This has the property you describe above, that you have
to keep track of it after the user has asked for it to go away.
	This property is on purpose.  When a user asks for something to
go away, it needs to disappear from configfs before the rmdir(2)
returns.  It's gone, and it is no longer accessible from userspace.  The
lifetiming of userspace access is clear, cut, and dried.
	However, some objects need some time to die.  So the driver has
its own reference, and it schedules any cleanup and death later.  But
that death and cleanup should happen as soon as possible, because
userspace has asked for it.

	You mean kernel-side references.  Again, you are asking for the
kernel to control the lifetime.

	This, as you are certainly aware, is a non-starter.  It just
won't work well.
	Let's break for a minute.  Let me try to restate all of this.
You have an interrelationship between a few configfs objects.  When a
[referrer -> reference] relationship is put together, you need to prevent
the reference from going away.  You've proposed a couple of methods that
boil down to "when the reference object knows it is being referred to,
it prevents itself from going away".
	Therein lies the rub.  configfs works by putting all of that in
userspace.  Lifetime decisions can only occur in userspace.  This allows
us a very clean lifetime from the userspace perspective.  It also means
that if we want to lock an object down, it has to happen in userspace.
	So, the object cannot "prevent itself from going away".  The
kernel side just can't do this.  Userspace, however, can.  You've
discussed the most common way configfs allows userspace to do this, the
symlink.  I believe your only problem was that of naming.  There's no
reason you can't populate a param_list file at the same time you respond
to ->allow_link().  Or, you could have userspace name the links in a
manner providing ordering.  These solve this problem without breaking
the configfs contract.
	Think about your requirements again.  Do you absolutely require
that some part of your kernel driver make a lifetime decision?  If so,
configfs isn't going to fit.  Can the lifetime decision be moved to
userspace?  If so, configfs should work just fine as-is, and you'll gain
the clean lifetime and simple manipulation that configfs provides.  I
hope it's the latter :-)
