The disk-drive motors, even for the 5.25 floppies were pancake motors
designed to directly turn the floppy, or run a belt with a small
ratio. You need a motor that runs at relatively high speed to turn the
capstan. If the capstan was 1 inch in circumference (about 0.2'' in
diameter), you need 120 revs/sec = 7200 r.p.m.  You won't do this with
a floppy motor.
