I can get pretty close to 50MB/sec compressing a nice long string of
zeros.  Over 100MB/sec decompressing the same.  But from the first test,
spinning my wheels on relatively uncompressible data gets me no where
slowly.
Of course the disk subsystem of this machine is also a hardware RAID
array of 8 (4 per channel) 10,000 RPM SCSI U320 drives.  So I'm not
approaching the speeds that I can get from it anyway.
