It all compiled fine here, and depmod doesn't complain about any
unresolved symbols. However, when I try to load snd.o, it tells that
snd_mixer_oss_notify_callback is unresolved. The relevant config
parameters are:
CONFIG_SOUND=y
CONFIG_SND=m
CONFIG_SND_OSSEMUL=y
CONFIG_SND_MIXER_OSS=m
CONFIG_SND_PCM_OSS=m
CONFIG_SND_RTCTIMER=m
CONFIG_SND_MAESTRO3=m
