Hi again,
	Thinking more about this, I think I must clarify why I choose this way.
In fact, the idea of these patches is to provide the missing user APIs (or
extend the existing ones) that allow to set or update _all_ properties of all
IPCs, as needed in the case of the checkpoint/restart of an application (the
current user API does not allow to specify an ID for a created IPC, for
example). And this, without changing the existing API of course.
	And msgget(), semget() and shmget() does not have any parameter we can use to
specify an ID.
	That's why I've decided to not change these routines and add a new control
command, IP_SETID, with which we can can change the ID of an IPC. (that looks to
me more straightforward and logical)
	Now, this patch is, in fact, only a preparation for the patch 10/15 which
really complete the user API by adding this IPC_SETID command.
(... continuing below ...)

And in fact, you do that from kernel space, you don't have the constraint to fit
the existing user API.
Again, this patch, even if it presents a new kernel API, is in fact a
preparation for the next patch which introduces a new user API.
Do you think that this could fit your need ?
