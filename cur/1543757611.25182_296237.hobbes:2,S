My opinion FWIW: I'm all for regularizing the pagetable loops to
work the same way, changing their variables to use the same names,
improving their efficiency; but I do like to see what a loop is up to.
list_for_each and friends are very widely used, they're fine, and I'm
quite glad to have their prefetching hidden away from me; but usually
I groan, grin and bear it, each time someone devises a clever new
for_each macro concealing half the details of some specialist loop.
In a minority?
