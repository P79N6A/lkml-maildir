Would you buy or use a stand-alone mixer where the only way to control 
total output would be to change the setting for one output, then 
rebalance all the others against it, and then iterate until the result 
is correct?
Is this an intermediate step to the full functionality of a $29 Radio 
Shack mixer, or a limitation of just one audio driver, or maybe the user 
interface for ALSA is broken right now?
Is it planned to leave Linux audio in this state?
