Will do.  Not exactly a simple thing, as the changes collide.

I thought it was better to change to git.  Isn't it so?
SubmittingPatches has nothing to say about that...
Can I find collected best practices somewhere?  Which tree, which
branch, how/when to rebase, format-patch, etc...
(If given no further instructions, I'll try my best and you can
reflect on the result.  I mean, the above questions are not blocking
me, feel free not to answer.)
