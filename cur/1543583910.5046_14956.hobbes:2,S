since of course all anyone hears are the disaster reports, i just
wanted to throw out my experience so far with 2.4... 2.4.0 and 2.4.1
didn't work very well on my box (a Dell Latitude CS-X laptop, PII-400,
256MB RAM, 20GB IDE), but i'm currently running 2.4.2-ac7 with no
problems at all.  the only difficulties i've had are that i've tried
the in-kernel PCMCIA on each 2.4 release with no luck (nothing works
with all my Ethernet cards, primarily my Farallon cardbus tulip card,
but also with my wavelan wireless and IDE cards), so i use David
Hinds' drivers.
performance in general screams, but sometimes when i start up a large
process (netscrape, or vmware) it dogs down for a couple seconds.
the one question i have is about VM.  the machine has 256MB of RAM in
it, and i never get near this usage with the actual processes
running.  nevertheless, /proc/meminfo says:
danube:/# cat /proc/meminfo 
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:

if 90MB are just cache, why do i have ~55MB swapped?  i'm not sure how
to see exactly how much of that swap is really being used or how often
things move in and out of swap, though.
