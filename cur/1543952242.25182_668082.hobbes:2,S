-5. TODO
+5. Virtual address space accounting
+
+A new resource counter controls the address space expansion of the tasks in
+the cgroup. Address space control is provided along the same lines as
+RLIMIT_AS control, which is available via getrlimit(2)/setrlimit(2).
+The interface for controlling address space is provided through
+"as_limit_in_bytes". The file is similar to "limit_in_bytes" w.r.t the user
+interface. Please see section 3 for more details on how to use the user
+interface to get and set values.
+
+The "as_usage_in_bytes" file provides information about the total address
+space usage of the cgroup in bytes.
+
+5.1 Advantages of providing this feature
+
+1. Control over virtual address space allows for a cgroup to fail gracefully
+   i.e, via a malloc or mmap failure as compared to OOM kill when no
+   pages can be reclaimed
+2. It provides better control over how many pages can be swapped out when
+   the cgroup goes over it's limit. A badly setup cgroup can cause excessive
+   swapping. Providing control over the address space allocations ensures
+   that the system administrator has control over the total swapping that
+   can take place.
+
+6. TODO
 
 1. Add support for accounting huge pages (as a separate controller)
 2. Make per-cgroup scanner reclaim not-shared pages first
