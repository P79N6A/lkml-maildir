Ok...
2.4.16-2.4.17-rc1 works perfectly
2.5.0-2.5.1 works perfectly
Only 2.5.1-dj1 has this 2 errors (ISA-PnP non-detection and USB only root hub detection)
All have the same .config
If you need some more information feel free to ask me ;)
Bye
PS: 2.5.1 (dj1 or not ;) has one problem more on my pc:
INIT can't send the TERM signal to all processes...
Nothing happens... no error message no nothing
SysRQ works
I don't know when it went into 2.5 but I think it wasn't there in -pre10 (don't try -pre11)
PPS: What the hell is APIC (no I don't mean ACPI)? ;) I've enabled it on my UP machine but don't know what it does...
Does anyone have informations about it?
