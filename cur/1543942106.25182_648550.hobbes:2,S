Hi Yasunori,
Hope you're feeling better!
Well the idea behind this was the following: if msgmni is changed say 
via procfs it is usually to increase it, in order for applications that 
need more msg queues to be able to run.
So even if a new ipc namespace is created or memory is removed, the 
application that has set that new value doesn't care: it wants msgmni to 
be unchanged. I agree with you that unconditionally turning the 
recomputing off may appear coarse, but I'm afraid that adding the 
functionality of turning that recomputing on/off will make things more 
complicated:
1) manage the tunable recomputing state: it shouldn't be turned on twice
2) adds more things to do at the user level.
I'll try to think about it more deeply and may be come up with an 
intermediate solution.
Regards,
Nadia
