I think there are two different issues. One is the proliferation of system 
calls, and the other is the sane design of internal kernel APIs.
The first one is not very interesting to me, since I don't have any strong 
opinions in either cases.
The second is the one I'd care most. I think that, whatever is the 
solution used to address the first, internal kernel APIs should be 
designed so that parameters flow down from the system call to the 
parameter's user code. IMO, besides very few cases where it could make 
some sense [*], setting some thread-global bits in the upper layer, to be 
magically picked up by code in the lower layers, does not lead to readable 
interfaces.
[*] Things that already read from a shared context, that is already 
    exposed to the user through some sort of set/get APIs.
