Give people 12 months warning (time to work out what they're going to do,
talk with the legal dept, etc) then make the kernel load only GPL-tagged
modules.
I think I'd favour that.  It would aid those people who are trying to
obtain device specs, and who are persuading organisations to GPL their drivers.
(Whereas the patch which is proposed in this thread hinders those people)
