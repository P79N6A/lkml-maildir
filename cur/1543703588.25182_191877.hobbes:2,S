Hiya,
I've a problem with UT2K3 on a Linux-2.6.1-mm4.
My ALSA bug seems to have disappeared, even if
it's maybe just an illusion but I still have a 
problem with UT2K3.
The sound of UT2K3 is faster than the usual.
It didn't appears on Linux-2.6.0.
If someone has an idea...
The use of the SDL output just makes the bug a
bit random (random speeds)
Best regards,
--
