hmm, I guess that explains the sh64/sh build failure ... ;)
but why does the sh/sh case fail?

okay, binutils and gcc seem to 'know' sh and sh64 as 
architectures, (in my case binutils 2.14.90.0.8, and 
gcc 3.3.2, w/o any patches), what binutils/gcc would
you suggest for building sh or sh64?

is there a toolchain/binutils which 'know' and 'support'
the '-isa=sh64' option? maybe it was depreciated?
gcc -isa=sh64 x.c
cc1: error: unrecognized option `-isa=sh64'
thanks for your input, I honestly appreciate it,
TIA,
Herbert
