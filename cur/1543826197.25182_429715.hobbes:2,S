I'd break it up into logical pieces (i.e., chapters...)
The lines are way too long for easy reading.
There are several other tools to check kernel quality: sparse, the
lockcheck, ... And don't forget about the various debugging config options
There are required tools for serious kernel development, i.e. git and its
entournage. Link to them.
You mention that patches cook in -mm for a while, but you don't tell what
that is beforehand. In general, a high-level overview of the current
git-based development would be useful, and the various important git kernel
trees and the patch flow among them.
Don't be shy in mentioning the stuff under Documentation in your nearest
kernel source!
Perhaps do an asccidoc format, to be able to create HTML?
