As a user, I can tell you that it completely fills my dmesg with this sort
ipmisensors: sensor 50 (type 1) reading 60
ipmisensors: Send 0x2d 0x30 0x0
ipmisensors: received message
ipmisensors: sensor 48 (type 1) reading 28
ipmisensors: Send 0x2d 0x1b 0x0
ipmisensors: received message
ipmisensors: sensor 27 (type 2) reading 34
ipmisensors: Send 0x2d 0x1a 0x0
ipmisensors: received message
ipmisensors: sensor 26 (type 2) reading 187
ipmisensors: Send 0x2d 0x18 0x0
That's the only problem I have. It would be great to see it merged.
Frank
