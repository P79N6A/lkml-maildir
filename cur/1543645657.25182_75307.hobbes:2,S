No-one suggested 2.6.0 shipping without /something/, but having a dead
LVM1 in _2.5_ doesn't help anyone. We've gone 6 months with it being in
a broken/uncompilable state, going another month without it isn't a big
deal. Getting something in before halloween is however a goal the
Sistina folks should be aiming for.
Consider it patch 1/2 of the device mapper merge 8-)
