Hi!
If I leave my machine on for a day or two without doing anything on it (e.g.
my machine at work over a weekend) and I come back then 1) all my memory is
used for buffers/caches and when I try running application, the OOM killer
kicks in, tries to allocate swap space (which I don't have) and kills
whatever I try start (that's with 300M+ memory in buffers/caches).
