I'd like to be able to (pretend to) add and remove PCI devices via
fakephp until this dummyphp/fakephp/newinterface stuff gets ironed out
and put into mainline.
In any case, I gave 2.6.24 a whirl.  2.6.24 fakephp sets up the BARs
correctly, so technically this is a regression fix too, even if only a
stopgap.
