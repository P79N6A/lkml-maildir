No, it should not cause problems as when you add the split-off copy back
into the mirror, it is treated as 'stale' and will get synchronised with
the original. 
I would be very surprised if the Linux software md driver worked any
diffrently than this. Perhaps someone that knows it in-depth can add to
the conversation?
With the facilities of LVM 'snapshots' now being available, this
practice of splitting off one copy from a three-way mirror is perhaps
becoming redundant, but people will likely take the approach of "if it
ain't broken, don't fix it" and leave old backup methods as they are.
So if you work in the sysadm field, you might well come across this
practice.
