Two words: "syscall interface".
Most of what you're blathering about needs to happen in userspace.
If there's disagreement over what GUI style to use, the kernel is
NOT going to provide any guidance.  KDE versus Gnome versus the
other 23 window managers - that's all userspace.  The reason there's
25 window managers is because 25 sets of people had *different goals*.
The kernel wisely stayed *OUT OF THE WAY*.
With a single common object model, Linux can push the envelope in ONE
direction.  Which is why That Other System scales so incredibly well from
a Zaurus to a 128-CPU NUMA box, handles different GUIs for different goals,
and all the rest of that.....
