I've dropped Linus off the direct list.  I think we should be able to debug
this one w/o his help. ;-)
Lines 594-606 of setup.c, which is the old section cause problems with
0-length regions, now properly handles them.  This must be some new problem.
Could we have the e820 data out of /var/log/dmesg?  head should work.

You're right.  I tried your memory tester with 2.3.36 and it crashes if I
let the kernel detect memory.  With mem=63M it's fine.
Do you know if this is the BIOS returning a bogus memory area (so we
have to test it and discard failing pages), or is it something that can
be fixed in the e820 code?
Your memory tester is a bit broken: the eaten amount is different to the
freed amount (with mem=63M):
     Eating pages ....(61068K) 
     Freeing pages ....(61064K)

As you can see, something is still broken with 2.3.36.  It worked fine
with some older 2.3 kernel (probably before the e820 code).
Enjoy,
