Dear Kernel developers!
Lots of things may have changed in 2.4.0-prer., because nor cdrecord
neither postgressql do not run because of system v ipc / shm problem.
After recompiling cdrecord with the new header files, started working.
I'm just recompiling postgres too.
/var/log/postgresql.log:
010102.10:45:09.448   [627] IpcMemoryCreate: shmget failed (No space left
on device) key=5432010, size=144, permission=700
This type of error is usually caused by an improper
shared memory or System V IPC semaphore configuration.
For more information, see the FAQ and platform-specific
FAQ's in the source directory pgsql/doc or on our
web site at 
http://www.postgresql.org
.
010102.10:45:09.481   [627] IpcMemoryIdGet: shmget failed (No such file or
directory) key=5432010, size=144, permission=0
010102.10:45:09.481   [627] IpcMemoryAttach: shmat failed (Invalid
argument) id=-2
010102.10:45:09.482   [627] FATAL 1:  AttachSLockMemory: could not attach
segment
010105.08:52:27.995 [12675] IpcMemoryCreate: shmget failed (No space left
on device) key=5432010, size=144, permission=700
cdrecord says the same no space left on device mesg.
Is there any other solution than recompiling programs?
all of the program which need shm/ipc will turn blue?
kernel 2.4.0-prerelease
postgresql                 7.0.3-2 postgresql                 7.0.3-2 
cdrecord 1.9
thx
