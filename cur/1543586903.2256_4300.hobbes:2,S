	This happens on a PIII/GigaByte 6BXE, Athlon 900/ABit KT7 and on a
friend's Cyrix M-II/333 with PC-Chips PC100 mobo and SIS chipset. The
PIII is a SuSE 6.4 base +++++, the others are SuSE 7.1 + modutils-2.4.5
and a few other bits.
	During boot and "lsusb" ver 0.7 only show the on-board USB chip, it
does not see the outboard Hub or devices. lsusb on the PIII will also
show the on-board chip, on the other machines it returns blank.
	We haven't yet tried USB as modules to see if it makes a difference.
