Alas, that smaller link... *is my own PPP connection*!
So... can't the masquerading/forwarding piece be smart enough to reduce
the *initial* size requested, when it forwards that?  Circumventing the
broken path MTU discovery?  I *DO* understand that if the link in the
middle is out of my control, it is just broken on that end.  But, it seems
the forwarding code *HAS* the pieces it needs to fix the <1460> into a
<256>, since it is in the middle of those two links...
