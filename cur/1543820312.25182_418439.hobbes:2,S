There is is some similarity, and it's a good thing.

Could you please elaborate?  How can it be fixed?  Do you know any
external module that doesn't have this problem?
If you have a could of minutes, please look at Orinoco, which probably
has the simplest build system, yet it suffers from the .tmp_versions
problem.  The Subversion repository is here
http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=44338
To check the main development branch, please use
svn co 
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/orinoco/trunk
 orinoco
This is the Makefile:
http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/
*checkout*/orinoco/trunk/Makefile
What would you fix?
