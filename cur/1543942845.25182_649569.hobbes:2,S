indeed ...
i think the 64-bit behavior of gcc is inherently dangerous, we had 
numerous subtle bugs in that area.
i think perhaps Sparse should be extended to warn about this. I think 
any case where on _32-bit_ we have an 'unsigned long' that is shifted to 
the left by any significant amount is clearly in danger of overflowing. 
_Especially_ when the lvalue is 64-bit!
or in other words, on any such construct:
   64-bit lvalue = ... 32-bit value
we should enforce _explicit_ (u64) conversions.
