A lot of the infrastructure using that has already been deleted, and
there are some incremental improvements pending for 2.6.25:
 - drivers/input/touchscreen/ads7846.c ... patch fixing this
   should be in either MM or the input queue
 - Documentation/power/devices.txt ... patch fixing this is
   in the suspend tree, due to merge RSN
 - drivers/spi/spi.c ... patch fixing this is in MM, due to
   merge with other SPI patches
 - drivers/pcmcia/ds.c ... at least I *think* that patch got sent
But there are still quite a few users left, and a new one was (sigh)
recently added.
 - drivers/rtc/rtc-sa1100.c ... new usage, merged last week
 - drivers/usb/... has various users, HCDs look easy enough to fix but
   the other bits will take more thought
 - drivers/ata/... has some too
 - drivers/ide/ppc/pmac.c
 - drivers/spi/... some controller drivers use this (look easy to fix)
 - drivers/scsi/mesh.c
 - drivers/input/serio/... has a few users
 - ... more ...
I'll probably send in a few more patches for easy stuff in areas
that I touch semi-frequently, but other folk should fix ATA, IDE,
SCSI, SERIO, and so forth.  It'd be good if Alan would help fix
the USB stuff too.  I'm not sure what Pavel's doing there...
