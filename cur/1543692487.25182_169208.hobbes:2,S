If cpu does not support big pagetables, then, during resume,
pagetables are all around the memory and hardware is setting
"accessed" bits in them. Very bad stuff might happen.

There are some comments I took from your code, and you have copyright
on them. (I plan to take more of your code.) If you want me not to add
copyright notice next time I copy your code, please say so.
