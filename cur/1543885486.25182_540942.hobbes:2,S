Subject: [RFC][PATCH] muptiple bugs in PI futexes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello!
1. New entries can be added to tsk->pi_state_list after task completed
   exit_pi_state_list(). The result is memory leakage and deadlocks.
2. handle_mm_fault() is called under spinlock. The result is obvious.
3. State machine is broken. Kernel thinks it owns futex after
   it released all the locks. Ergo, it corrupts futex. The result is that
   two processes think they took a futex.
All the bugs are trivially reproduced when running glibc's tst-robustpi7
test long enough.
The patch is not quite good (RFC!), because:
1. There is one case, when I did not figure out how to handle
   page fault correctly. I would do it releasing taken rtmutex
   and hb->lock and retrying futex from the very beginning.
   It is quite ugly. Probably, state machine can be fixed somehow.
2. Before this patch I had one unexplained oops inside rtmutex
   in plist_del. I did _not_ fix this, but it does not want to reproduce.
   Probably, more strong locking did some race window too narrow.
