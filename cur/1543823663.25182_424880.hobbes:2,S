Ok the via timing are ok now.
If I had in ata_host_intr someting like [1] for checking the altstatus, my
ATAPI drive works.
It report "ata_altstatus take 3us", for driver that wasn't worked before.
I don't know if it is a correct fix and where it should be putted (in
libata-core or in the pata_via check_altstatus callback).
I don't know if it should be used only for ATA_CMD_SET_FEATURES &&
SETFEATURES_XFER.
Now real testing could begging.

		for (i=0; ata_altstatus(ap) & ATA_BUSY; i++) {
                        if (i > 10)
                                goto idle_irq;
                udelay(1);
                }
                if (i)
                        printk("ata_altstatus take %dus\n", i);
