That clarifies the roots of this %esp check, as without
the stack ulimit and without the proper memory accounting
(the case of 2.4?) such a check is the "last hope" - I've
got the point. But are there the reasons to still keep it
in 2.6, considering also the false-positives? It seems to
have the STACK_RLIMIT and it seems to get the memory accounting
right, and not too many arches seem to have such a check even.
