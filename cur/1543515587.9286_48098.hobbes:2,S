Hmm. Strange...
 1) Does the ordinary NFS client (no amd or plptools) give the same
    error?
 2) What about 'traceroute -s 256'? (Most versions of traceroute
    should be able to interpret the NFS protocol, and tell you what is
    being sent down the wire.) I'd like to know whether the server
    really is replying ENOSPC, or whether there's a 'translation
    error' somewhere...
Cheers,
  Trond
