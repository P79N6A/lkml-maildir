OK, I agree with you. This is what my ideal world of free software looks like
:) 
I am trying to figure out the guide but ran into numerous problems.
First I tried to install the sources of docbook-utils from Debian
sources, either with or without their patch. Neither of them installs the required db2html
script db2html.
Then I tried to install docbook-utils-0.6.13 from freshmeat.net's docbook-utils
entry.  It required jade (some kind of UNIX editor) jade required librep (LISP
interpreter and virtual machine) librep first seemed to require gmp but then I
discovered it can be built without GMP
Having installed librep and jade, I tried to compiile the docbook-utils-0.6.13
but it crashes during make on cryptic message:
make[2]: Entering directory `/home/clock/docbook-utils-0.6.13/doc/HTML'
SGML_CATALOG_FILES=/etc/sgml/catalog \

        jade -t sgml -i html -d ../../docbook-utils.dsl\#html \
                -V '%use-id-as-filename%' ../../doc/docbook-utils.sgml

Do you have any suggestion what it could be? All the prerequisites
seem to be installed.
