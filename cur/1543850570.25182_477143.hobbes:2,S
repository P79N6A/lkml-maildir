Adrian, thanks for the lead, so I decided to try different PCI setting.
Setting to "BIOS" make tg3 works again.
Up to 2.6.18, I was using "PCI access mode (Any)" and had no problem,
but from  2.6.19-rc1 onwards, setting to "ANY" doesn't seem to work
anymore.
I've just tested all 2.6.19-rc[123] and all are working with the
"BIOS" setting, but not "ANY".
New setting in .config ...
CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS=y
# CONFIG_PCI_GOANY is not set
Thanks for all your help!
Jeff.
