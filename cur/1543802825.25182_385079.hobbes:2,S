Interesting!  Missed this on the first time around...
But doesn't notifier_call_chain_lockfree() need to either disable
preemption or use atomic operations to update notifier_chain_lockfree_inuse[]
in order to avoid problems with preemption?  If I understand the
code, one such problem could be caused by the following sequence
of events:
1.	Task A enters notifier_call_chain_lockfree(), gets a copy
	of the current CPU in local variable "cpu", snapshots the
	(initially zero) value of notifier_chain_lockfree_inuse[cpu]
	into local variable "nested", then is preempted.
2.	Task B enters notifier_call_chain_lockfree(), gets a copy
	of the current CPU in local variable "cpu", snapshots the
	(still zero) value of notifier_chain_lockfree_inuse[cpu]
	into local variable "nested", sets the value of
	notifier_chain_lockfree_inuse[cpu] to 1.
3.	Task A runs again, perhaps because Task B's priority dropped,
	perhaps because some other CPU became available.  It also
	sets the value of notifier_chain_lockfree_inuse[cpu] to 1.
	It then gains a reference to a notifier_block (call it Fred).
4.	Task B completes running through the notifier chain and sets
	notifier_chain_lockfree_inuse[cpu] = nested, which is zero.
5.	Task C invokes notifier_chain_unregister_lockfree() in order
	to remove Fred.  Task C finds all notifier_chain_lockfree_inuse[cpu]
	entries equal to zero, so removes Fred while Task A is still
	referencing it.  Which I believe is what was to be prevented.
If one updates notifier_chain_lockfree_inuse[cpu] using atomics,
then one could imagine a sequence of calls to notifier_call_chain_lockfree()
and preemptions that prevented one of the notifier_chain_lockfree_inuse[]
elements from ever reaching zero (though maybe this is being overly
paranoid).  If one disables preemption, then latency might become
excessive.
So what am I missing?
						Thanx, Paul
