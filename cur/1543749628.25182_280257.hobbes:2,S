If say I have 980KB of memory used (of a total of 1GB
physical RAM), and rest currently in swap memory
giving me 1GB total ram used, and a swap of 1GB, when
suspending would this fail? Wouldn't the swapped
partition memory have to be moved somewhere? 
I can't be sure because I cant suspend to disk yet..
it continues to abort and I wonder if its due to the
swap size not being big enough for all ram + swapped
memory to fit on the swap partition?
If so, I need to resize it.
Shawn.
