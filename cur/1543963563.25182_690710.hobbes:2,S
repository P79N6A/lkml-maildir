Sorry for being rather late to the game - other stuff keeps me from
doing anything much here :-(.
Anyway, the current applications don't support IRQ assingment anyway.
That's a new feature; and its quite common that new features require
code changes.
So I'm not seeing the problem - don't change code and stuff works as
before - change code and you get new stuff.
So I'm arguing in favour of the IRQs as tasks idea that might need extra
hierarchy levels.
