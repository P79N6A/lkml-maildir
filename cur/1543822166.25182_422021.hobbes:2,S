But presently it changes all the time when we change the implementation
of pdflush or kswapd.
If we make pdflush threads blk_congestion_wait for twice as long, and
end up creating twice as many to feed the same amount of IO, our load
magically doubles but the machine is under almost exactly the same
load condition.
Back when we didn't have all these kernel threads doing work for us,
that wasn't an issue.

I'm not sure if that is any better, and perhaps even worse. It does not
matter that much if VM zones are under a watermark if kswapd is taking
care of the problem and nothing ever blocks on memory IO.
(Sure kswapd will contribute to CPU usage, but that *will* be reflected
in load average)

A global loadavg isn't too good anyway, as everyone has observed, there
are many independant resources. But my point is that it isn't going away
while apps still use it, so my point is that this might be an easy way to
improve it.
