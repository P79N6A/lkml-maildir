What's so fundamentally different about inline functions, or, IOW, a
finer format of macros?
It doesn't matter if the API is inline or not. What matters is if using
this API makes your program a derivative work. From this perspective,
it's just an interface, no matter how it's implemented.
Let's be frank: how many people really try to read the header file when
they use these APIs? They don't care if they are inlined or not. To them
they are just _APIs_.
