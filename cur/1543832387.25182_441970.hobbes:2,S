well not sure about all of them... but it sucks.
Just take the alsa/OSS case. It's taken Adrian Bunk a LOT of effort to
get people to report bugs against alsa; unless you threaten to remove
the other driver they just won't and switch to the other driver. On the
one hand, that is choice. On the other, it's BAD. The user experience is
BAD. It means we end up with 2 half arsed cases (since the OSS driver
doesn't do other things) instead of one quite good one.
