Hello all,
I wanted to make sure this was a genuine problem that continually occured
before I reported it. I think at least a dozen times in the past two weeks
justifies a bug report.
I've had this problem with the 2.2.x series kernels, but didn't have it
with 2.1.x or 2.0.x. In fact, it's only been cropping up recently. I can
recall 11 day uptimes with earlier 2.2.x releases. I've had it occur with
2.2.1, 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.5, 2.2.7 and just now, 2.2.8.
It tends to occur during disk activity, such as loading programs
(loading ps caused it once), updating the locate database, and during
fscks. It is most likely to occur during the latter, where I must reboot
without cleaning unmounting. It'll often Oops again during the following 
fsck (the example I've pasted occured at this time). I can, however,
reboot after the Oops and it'll continue to fsck and eventually finish,
assuming it doesn't Oops again. In other words, there's really no strict
pattern, except that fscks tend to trigger it the most often (because of
high disk activity). The problem seems to be sporadic yet definite.
Attempts to recreate it manually have been unsuccessful.
The actual Oops, while running 2.2.8:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address c023a004
current->tss.cr3 = 00101000, %cr3 = 00101000

That's the typical message. Sometimes (once, at least) it'll have, instead
of the first five lines (right before CPU: 0):
segment not present: 0003
So as the documentation says, I ran this through ksymoops. This is my
first time using it, so I hope I got it right:

The two relevant (apparently relevant) pieces of hardware involved are a
Quantum Fireball SE 6.4g HD, and an EPoX 51MVP3E motherboard. I know EPoX
motherboards have rather high failure rates. In fact, the one previous to
this (which was replaced with this one, the same model) was causing all
sorts of problems with the HD, and prevented a successful install.
If there's any more information needed to fully diagnose this problem,
email me, of course. I'm hoping that this is a kernel bug that can be
squished, and not some failing piece of hardware.
Thanks for your support.
