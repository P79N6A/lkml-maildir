This set of patches fix various problems mostly related to
copy/user problems and leaks. I worked based on Alan's list and
either forward ported from 2.4 whatever was available or fixed
by code inspection. They compile, but haven't really been tested.
They are diffed against 2.5.70.
Thanks
Dipankar
