Please, then if you patch this place add these changes:
         while (first <= last) {
                const struct exception_table_entry *mid;
-               long diff;
                mid = (last - first) / 2 + first;
-               diff = mid->insn - value;
-                if (diff == 0)
+               if (mid->insn == value)
                         return mid->fixup;
-                else if (diff < 0)
+               else if (mid->insn < value)
                         first = mid+1;
                 else
                         last = mid-1;
since using long diff is incorrect here when distance between addresses is greater than 2GB on i386. (e.g. 4gb split).
