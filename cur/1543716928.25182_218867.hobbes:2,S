Hi folks!
Strange things are happinging some times, and here we have a new. :-)
We have a machine with five partitions mounted. One of those partitions
is /usr. We can created files on /usr, but we cannot created
directories. mkdir says, that there is no space left on device, but
there actually IS space as you can see and files can be created, so why
NO directories? Is it the kernel, is it the filesystem, is it the full
moon high in the sky? :-) I have no clue, but maybe you have... Any
help/idea is welcome!
Please have a look at this log:
