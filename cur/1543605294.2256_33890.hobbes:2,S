Of course not, I never said that. But introducting this
stiupid tagging wan't help them anyway... so why do they introduce it?
The same solution applys as ever - just say: "We don't care about
kernels different from anything on ftp.kernel.org." and let it be...
I really see no advantage in this tagging. It's a common trap
in the western world to beleve that the introduction of some
"anti law" is actually preventing "voilence" from happenning.
