Problem identified.  It was a combination of two things.  In drain_dac() we 
were calling update_ptr() *after* setting our task state to 
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE.  Well, the way that wait queues work is that when 
update_ptr() kept calling wake_up() because we had more than 1 userfragsize 
of space available to write it would clear our task state back to 
TASK_RUNNING before we would ever call schedule_timeout().  The result is 
that in drain_dac() we would go into a very tight loop of never sleeping and 
always updating things waiting for the dma to finish.  That was problem 1. 
Problem 2 was that in get_hardware_addr() we were finding a bug the SiS 
hardware.  Basically on the SiS stuff we were catching the hardware in 
updates to the sg segment it was dma'ing.  With a slight change to the 
routine to cause it to delay slightly and then recheck the hardware to make 
sure that what it reads is consistent, the problem should be solved. 
Anyway, a new 0.18 version of the driver is up on my site.  It should solve 
*all* of the particular problems you were seeing.  Let me know how it works.
Also, thanks for spending soooo much time getting me the traces and stuff 
you did John.  It was what allowed me to find these two issues.
