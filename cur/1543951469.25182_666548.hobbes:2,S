TCE tables are allocated using alloc_bootmem_low() with goal set to 0. 
Don't know if this will be sufficient. Investigating...

A bitmap is created once the first kernel's TCE table is found. This 
bitmap is populated by reading the entries in the tce table. Non-zero 
entries in the table are marked as used/reserved in the bitmap.

This is the root cause of the problem.

The pci bus on that PHB goes into an undefined state ( returning 
0xffffffff for all reads on that bus ).

The system booted! , :) with the following change. Muli acceptable??
static void calgary_watchdog(unsigned long data)
{
...
...
/* Disable bus that caused the error and ignore if it's kdump kernel */
+ if ( !is_kdump_kernel()) {
target = calgary_reg(bbar, phb_offset(tbl->it_busno) |
PHB_CONFIG_RW_OFFSET);
val32 = be32_to_cpu(readl(target));
val32 |= PHB_SLOT_DISABLE;
writel(cpu_to_be32(val32), target);
+ }
readl(target); /* flush */
