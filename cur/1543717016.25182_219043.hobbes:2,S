While I have some patch sets around for earlier 2.6 kernels I advise 
against using them.
I'm in the process of making "single file" patches for the earlier kernels 
with all the updates that are in 2.6.6-rc3-mm2.
As an aside the same goes for the 2.4 patches.
I'll let you know when it's done. I expect to finish this weekend.
