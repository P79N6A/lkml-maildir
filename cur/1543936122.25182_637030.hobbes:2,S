Hi Ingo,
A couple of patches:
1. Fold _PAGE_GLOBAL back into 64-bit __PAGE_KERNEL*, and remove the
MAKE_GLOBAL hack.  Not sure if it will work, but the iounmap problem
should have been fixed by Jan's patch.
2. I noticed the _PAGE_PCD|_PAGE_PWT combination being used a lot, so
I created _PAGE_NOCACHE to wrap them up.  asm-x86/fb.h uses plain
_PAGE_PCD; should it be _PAGE_NOCACHE too?
Thanks,
	J
