This release equated to something like gcc 3.2.1 + some work from the
3.3 branch + some in-house work.

No, it's not completely separate.  We do follow the mainline tree
(largely via gcc CVS rather than released tarballs), though we tend to
have fairly long periods between such 'rebaselinings'.

A lot of changes have already gone into the mainline gcc 3.4 branch.
As for binutils, I assume the position is similar, but I've not checked
the details.

OK.  Acknowleged.  BTW that version has the same basic ancestry as the
April 14th version, it just has some additional in-house fixes in it.
