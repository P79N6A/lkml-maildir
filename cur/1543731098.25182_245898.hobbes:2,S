Erm...  What do we do upon unlink()?  I'm killing a file, fs it's in is
mounted in a dozen of places (no namespaces, just chroot jails, whatever).
We need to find all vfsmounts to be killed by that.
And BTW that's an argument against anchoring that list in inode - unlink()
on foo should not screw bar/... even if bar and foo are links to the same
file.  So we'll need to check for dentry match anyway.

Several paragraphs below you are saying that you don't like fs messing with
vfsmounts.  Use of ->lookup() would mean that we should not only create
and attach vfsmounts from within fs code, but would actually have to make
->lookup() return vfsmount+dentry, AFAICS.

Err...  What about dir-on-dir-that-is-on-file?  I.e. mount on foo/. when foo
is a file?

See above on use ->lookup()
