If we wish to do this then we might as well be honest about the current code
and say
	'power management doesnt work on SMP either'
alternatively the right thing to do is to fix both PM and the pcmcia. Most of
the PCMCIA can be fixed for 2.4 by dropping lock_kernel() around the relevant
areas. Sure its ugly but PCMCIA hot swapping is not a critical performance code
path.
