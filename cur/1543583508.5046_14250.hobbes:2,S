Couldn't agree with you more. The elevator does a decent job
these days, but higher level clustering could do more ...

Enhancing writepage() to perform clustering is the first step.
In addition you want entities (kupdated, kswapd, et. al)
that currently work with only buffers to invoke writepage()
at appropriate points. Just today I sent a patch that does this
and also combines delayed allocation out to Al Viro for comments.
If anyone else is interested I can send it out to the list.
