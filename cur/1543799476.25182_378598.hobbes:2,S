Jens also posted a different patch on
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/21/111
 addressing my issue. It was supposed
to go in -stable. But, from I see in changelogs, nothing went into
-stable while something similar has been merged into rc3:
http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blobdiff;h=43fa2049568883d6b5c07cc304b77c93d3091abf;hp=fbe050124ec514431c19091d395fa9065b2398a4;hb=8ad9ebb391e4cd75837ee608b9c33fcaceda0bc2;f=block/as-iosched.c
Anyway, I did not reproduce my problem with the first patch that Jens
sent (applied on top of 2.6.14). 2.6.15-rcX look fine too, but I am not
sure I have stressed those kernels as much as 2.6.14.
