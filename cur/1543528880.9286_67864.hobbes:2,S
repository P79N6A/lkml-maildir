The discussion was held mostly privately among Linux port maintainers, but
parts of it went to lkml, just do a search.

It can be fairly slow, its the same as why there is no virt_to_phys for
vmalloced area (both may require looking up some page tables, in
pci_map_invert IO page tables particularly on some machines).
What's so hard in remembering the dma_addr_t the API gives you?
It is not hard to store the consistent mapping dma addresses into device
private structures and for the streaming mappings you can store them e.g.
into the SCp members of Scsi_Cmnd structure etc. It will be definitely
faster.

We have still not decided on PCI64 DMA support. Following is one proposal,
the other one is just using 64bit dma_addr_t on platforms for which DAC is
useful (sparc64, alpha, mips64, ia64), but still leaving dma_mask default to
0xffffffff. Drivers which support DAC would just set it to ~0ULL.
That one would require some inspection of already converted drivers to make
sure nothing depends on the size of dma_addr_t (e.g. that nobody stores it
into fixed size structure etc.), pci64_* interface would not need that, on
the other side it would be harder to have drivers which will dynamically
choose PCI64 and PCI32:
I don't know whether there might be cards which support more than 32bits but
less than 64bits of the address during a DAC, but I strongly doubt about it,
so we can as well just not look at dma_mask at all and drivers don't have to
check pci_dma_supported() (because otherwise, unless we chose some magic
value (#define PCI_DMA_64BIT (dma_addr_t)0), all drivers would have to cope
with a 64bit dma64_addr_t (either via inlines in asm/pci.h or
pci-dma.c/pci-iommu.c)).
So, IMHO we can simply come with this interface:
#if PLATFORM_USES_64BIT_DMA_ADDRESSES
typedef u64 dma64_addr_t;
extern void *pci64_alloc_consistent(struct pci_dev *hwdev, size_t size, dma_addr64_t *dma_handle);

extern void pci64_unmap_single(struct pci_dev *hwdev, dma_addr64_t dma_addr, size_t size, int direction);
