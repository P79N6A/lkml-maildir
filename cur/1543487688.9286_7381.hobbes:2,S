Hello,
I can reproduce the stall using the code posted
by Matthias Moeller on 2.2.2-ac5, compiled with
egcs 1.1.1 running on uniprocessor PPro 166 MHz.
I was not able to reproduce it on stock 2.2.1,
but I did not try very extensively.
I have done some research on the WRITE_SIZE,
READ_SIZE and number of loops (3200 in
the original code). It does not seem to
be a race - there is a clear pattern
that seems to be deterministic. Fiddling
with tcp_sack does not change anything.
Perhaps somebody familiar with the used
algorhitms can interpret the pattern. I am
willing to test any experimental patches.
1) Server: WRITE_SIZE 1585, LOOPS 3200
   Client: varying READ_SIZE
     The stall occurs when READ_SIZE <= 956
2) Client: READ_SIZE 956
   Server: WRITE_SIZE 1585, varying LOOPS
     The stall occurs when LOOPS >= 45
3) Client: READ_SIZE 956
   Server: LOOPS 45, varying WRITE_SIZE
     The stall occurs, if
       WRITE_SIZE >= 1480       && <= 1505
        or
       WRITE_SIZE >= 1554 (+74) && <= 1585 (+80)
        or
       WRITE_SIZE >= 1636 (+82) && <= 1673 (+88)
        or
       WRITE_SIZE >= 1727 (+91) && <= 1771 (+98)
Some more numbers for stalling cases:
WRITE_SIZE   LOOPS   READ_SIZE   bytes read    Send-Q
                                 succesfully
