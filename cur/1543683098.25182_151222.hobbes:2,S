[snip snip]
	SCSI bus trace = logging? I started poking around online for how that
works, and I found repeatable case of what I hope is the same error (one
tar from the bad scsi disk piping into another tar onto a good scsi
disk). One problem I ran into is that scsi_logging=X as a kernel
parameter doesn't seem to work in 2.6.0-test1, so I put in a S00 init
script to do the:
echo "scsi log all" > /proc/scsi/scsi
	The resulting /var/log/messages is ~18M, compressed down to 300k.

	Is this what you need?
	I did a quick test of the above case on a 2.4.21 kernel and it didn't
seem to trigger anything evil.
	If it turns out to be a firmware problem, is the firmware upgradeable
or do I have to buy a new drive, in which case is there a blacklist?
