Yep that was the problem.
Thanks for the help Rob.
This fixes the 2.6.24 kernel for qemu, I would like to see these
patches put into the stable series.
Is that OK for everyone? if they are in the 2.6.25 tree then we just
send the commit ids to the stable team...
I will send the details to stable on monday if knobody shouts.
