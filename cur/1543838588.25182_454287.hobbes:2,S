Hi, I've just started looking into this, so some comments here first
on the submission process:
 - could you send new revisions of the patches in a new thread so one can
   easily find them?
 - the patch split is not very nice, your first patch adds Makefile and
   Kconfig entries for files only in the second patch or not actually
   submitted at all, that's a big no-no.
