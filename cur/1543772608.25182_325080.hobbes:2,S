Patches with 3 minor rejects against -rc6-mm1, boots, and seems to work well on
my Dell Latitude C840 laptop - although running at full load with seti@home
causes the expected 250 timer ticks/sec, running a mostly-idle  X session only
gets about 117, and having xmms and a few other things running it hits about
170 tics/sec. I've had the CPU speed bounce between 1.2G and 1.6G a few times
and it didn't seem to blink either. Even NTP is happy with what it sees.. ;)
Need to rebuild with CONFIG_HZ=1000 and see what it does, and see what it does
to actual power consumption.
Minor nit:  The implementation of /sys/devices/system/timer/timer0/dyn_tick_state
violates the one-value-per-file rule for sysfs.  I suspect this needs to
become a directory with 3-4 files in it, each containing one value.
