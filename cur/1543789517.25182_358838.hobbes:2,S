On 390, we have standalone dump. That is a tool you can install on a disk
with zipl (like lilo) and that you boot when your server has crashed.
Newer machines also have a hardware feature built-in that does this from the
service element (that is a laptop computer mounted to the big box).
When running on z/VM, there is a command you can enter on z/VM's console
which causes z/VM to create a dump of Linux' memory.
Different from kdump we can even take a dump if our system is so badly
corrupted that you don't even get a panic message. As far as I know, kdump
would require to reserve memory for the extra kernel prior to crash, which
is not the case with our soloutions.
