ntp should do that anyway - check you have a drift file defined in ntp.conf
# Drift file.  Put this in a directory which the daemon can write to.
# No symbolic links allowed, either, since the daemon updates the file

driftfile /etc/ntp/drift
Over time it will adjust to suit and step the changes gracefully.
