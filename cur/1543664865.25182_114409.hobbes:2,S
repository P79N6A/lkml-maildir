The problem is that I only have one yenta-compatible cardbus controller, and
one pcmcia card -- no real "infrastructure" to test the patches.[*] And I
really try to verify that my patches work, but obviously I had a bad day
when I wrote the "let's add a pcmcia socket devices class" patch.
Nonetheless, one point you mention is perfectly valid -- the kernel is in 
a feature freeze.

[*] Needless to say, the patches I sent tend to work on the hardware I
own...
