Hi Randy,
Thanks for the comments, see below :

The goal of this "empty" function is just to have to compiler check the string
format consistency.
I separated the function declaration and implementation because I have seen some
compilers complain about having the two merged together.
I will change it to
static inline __attribute__ ((format (printf, 1, 2)))
void __mark_check_format(const char *fmt, ...)
{ }
And hope every compiler will like it.
The empty implementation is because the function is called (must therefore be
implemented), but I expect the compiler to completely optimize it away.

It has to be debated. The default for markers will put a symbol for all the
markers, so that kprobe can easily attach to it. It has no impact that I am
aware of except to boost the number of symbols.
