Hello,
We tried contacting you awhile ago about your low interest mor/tag rate.
You have qualified for the lowest rate in years...
You could get over 380,000 for as little as 500 a month!
B ad credit? Doesn't matter, low rates are fixed no matter what!
To get a free, no oblig-ation consultation click below:
