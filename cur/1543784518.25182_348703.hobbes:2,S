I cherrypicked five of your patches yesterday as ones which look like they
should be in 2.6.14.
	fix i386 cmpxchg
	adjust .version updating
	free initrd mem adjustment
	constify font data
	minor fbcon_scroll adjustment
But none of those are NMI-related.  Specifically which patch are you
referring to?

Yup, thanks for that.

Well.  That's what I mean by "Each patch should do a single logical thing".
 If that single logical thing is "add a debugger" then OK.  We regularly
add things like new filesystems in a single patch.
That begin said, people sometimes also choose to break a lage patch into
multiple patches even if they're all interdependent.  We don't mind that,
but it's not terribly useful.  One advantage of this approach is that it
splits the patch up into chunks which the vger mail server will accept -
I'm not sure what the email size limit is but it seems to be around 80-100
kbytes.

a) Patches which affect the main kernel but which aren't really
   debugger-related
b) Patches which affect the main kernel and which are debugger-related
   (adding hooks, generalising interfaces, refactoring functions, etc).
c) Finally, one monster patch to add the debugger functionality.  Maybe
   split into in vger-sized chunks.
