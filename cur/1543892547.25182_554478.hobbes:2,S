Nope. Currently "key" is part of the name (but its not unique).

I am not breaking ABI. Its already broken in the current
mainline. I am trying to fix it by putting back the ino#
as shmid. Eric had a suggestion that, instead of depending
on the inode# to be shmid, we could embed shmid into name
(instead of "key" which is currently not unique).

If you strongly feel that "old" behaviour needs to be retained, 
here is the patch I originally suggested.
Thanks,
Badari
"ino#" in /proc/pid/maps used to match "ipcs -m" output for shared 
memory (shmid). It was useful in debugging, but its changed recently. 
This patch sets inode number to shared memory id to match /proc/pid/maps.
