You have plenty of memory that should be reclaimable (active+inactive, 
though
some may be mlocked or otherwise unreclaimable).
What it looks like is that the page reclaim is not able to take place, 
because
all your allocations are coming from interrupt context.
Normally what will happen is that kswapd will be woken up, and ksoftirqd 
will
start throttling (soft) interrupts and kswapd will be allowed to get a 
chance
to run. With the -rt kernel, I guess if your network irq has a higher 
priority
than kswapd, it could prevent it from running completely. (I could be wrong
here).
You might try increasing /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes, or failing that, 
increase
the priority of kswapd to something comparable to or greater than your 
network
interrupt.
I'm not very familiar with the -rt tree, but possibly what should be 
happening,
if interrupts are executed in process context and allowed to schedule, 
is that
their memory allocations should also be allowed to reclaim memory.
OTOH, I guess for a deterministic realtime system, you need to allocate 
fixed
minimum amounts of memory for each element of the system so you never 
run out
like this.
