2.2.6 has ncr53c8xx driver 3.2 and sym53c8xx driver 1.3c which are very
recent driver versions. I have some new diffs, but they are not real
fixes. If you SCSI card is recent, you can use any of these drivers with
it and even configure the both drivers and select a driver for your board
at boot-up (or load the module you want if you prefer modules).

Btw, your short description of your reset problem looks like a SCSI BUS 
problem or a SCSI device problem (just guessing).
