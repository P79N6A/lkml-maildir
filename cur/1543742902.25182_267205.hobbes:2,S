Serial console working really early isn't just a requirement for x86.
It's useful elsewhere too. 
The problem is that 'console=ttySx' doesn't actually do anything unless
port numer 'x' is already registered and working. We should fix that --
we ought to be able to use 'console=ttySx' on the command line and have
the console get registered with the core printk code later, when some
8250 sub-driver (8250_platform, 8250_pci, etc.) actually registers the
port which becomes number 'x'. 
That would allow 'early' serial consoles to have none of the horrible
special-cased 'earlyconsole' crap -- we just call register_serial() (or
early_serial_setup() or whatever) as soon as it's actually possible to
poke at the port.
It also fixes the case of serial console on a PCI device.
