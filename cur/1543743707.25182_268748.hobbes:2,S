Probably, but it looks like it does not display in menuconfig and it is 
set by default. I understand that it is a good example, but it should be 
disabled by default I think... Or at least it should show in menuconfig. 
And I do not know why embedded environments want to use ramfs more 
than tmpfs. Swap is not needed for tmpfs and even if device has no swap it 
can be oomed because of ramfs too.
Will you accept this patch:

I think that RAMFS can not be build as a module becuse it is marked bool. 
Am I wrong?
If you will apply this it will be my first kernel patch in mainline. Wow! 
:-)
Because of this reason please do not complain too loud if something is 
not ok with this patch. I am inexperienced in producing and sending 
patches for inclusion into Linux. If this patch is broken or you do not 
want to apply it in this form, I will be more than happy to fix it of 
course.
Thanks,
