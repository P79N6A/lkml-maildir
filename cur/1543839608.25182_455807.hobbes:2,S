Alan,
2.4 has no printk_ratelimit() function and I'm not sure it's worth adding
one for only this user. One could argue that once it's implemented, we can
uncomment some other warnings that are currently disabled due to lack of
ratelimit.
In this special case (set*uid), the only reason we might fail is because
kmem_cache_alloc(uid_cachep, SLAB_KERNEL) would return NULL. Do you think
it could intentionnally be tricked into failing, or that under OOM we might
bother about the excess of messages ?
If so I can backport the printk_ratelimit() function, I would just like an
advice on this.
Thanks,
Willy
