The drive has unexpectedly dropped off the bus during a connection.
Without a SCSI bus trace it is impossible to know why the drive might
have done this or if perhaps a glitch on the BSY line is causing the
controller to detect a spurious busfree.

I have my hands too full trying to replicate problems seen with the
latest driver and debug their cause to go back and try and figure
out what an old driver version might have done to upset a drive.
