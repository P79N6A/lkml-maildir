OK.. it looks like the problem only hits if it's a PCMCIA card *with an
onboard ROM*.
The immediate problem cause is in pcibios_enable_resources():
                if (!r->start && r->end) {
                        printk(KERN_ERR "PCI: Device %s not available because of resource collisions\n", dev->slot_name);
If there's an onboard ROM, this is set up in pcibios_assign_resources():
                if (pci_probe & PCI_ASSIGN_ROMS) {
                        r = &dev->resource[PCI_ROM_RESOURCE];
                        r->end -= r->start;
                        r->start = 0;
                        if (r->end)
                                pci_assign_resource(dev, PCI_ROM_RESOURCE);
                }               
but this hasn't happened yet in cb_alloc():
                /* FIXME: Do we need to enable the expansion ROM? */
                for (r = 0; r < 7; r++) {
                        struct resource *res = dev->resource + r;
                        if (res->flags)
                                pci_assign_resource(dev, r);
                }
So I think right *AFTER* this code is the right place for pci_enable_device()
because otherwise we won't have allocated the ROMs, so we'll get conflicts.
/Valdis (who went nuts looking at <6 and <7 all over the place.  Should I
volunteer to clean these up to #defines rather than inline magic numbers? ;)
