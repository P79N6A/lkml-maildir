Hi:
I don't want to be too OT or bothersome, but can someone explain why 
gettimeofday() is the one syscall that optimization at the ~100 cycle level 
makes sense for? If it's a long explanation, a link or pointer to a book is 
more then fine. I'm trying to get the wet feet here and this one I don't know 
about. ;)
