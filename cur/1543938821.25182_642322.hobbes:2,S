That is a dangerous thing to do. SLAB per cpu queues will contain foreign 
objects which may cause troubles when pushing the objects back. I think we 
may be lucky that these objects are consumed at boot. If all of the 
foreign objects are consumed at boot then we are fine. At least an 
explanation as to this issue should be added to the patch.
