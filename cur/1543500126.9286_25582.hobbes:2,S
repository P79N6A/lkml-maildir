That is good for identifying which parts of the linux kernel are beta 
( or alpha quality). I am talking about a stamp of approval
from the kernel developers for the overall kernel. Right
now there are only 2 labels -- Development and Stable. I am
taking about refining it a bit more-- development, beta and
stable. At least with the 2.2 series, I think distribution makers 
(Redhat, Suse, and possibly others) jumped in too early. At 
the risk of sounding bureaucratic, let me suggest a scheme.
I think we should wait for x days ( a week, 10 days pick 
your choice) before a beta version is declared stable.
Of course, you can argue that users can a set a rule for 
themselves. It just make the life of users a little easier
if the software itself gives more information about its quality.
