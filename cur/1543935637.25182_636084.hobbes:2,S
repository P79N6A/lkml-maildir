Sorry, but that's a really really small benefit.  This very small number of
fairly (or very) technical users will be able to work out a way of getting
this to work in 2.6.24.  And in 2.6.25 with a merged mmiotrace we can do
something different.
It's a modest convenience to a very small number of people.  And the cost? 
Multiple functions calls and multiple cachelines hit for every pagefault
on, what?  Tens of millions of machines?
Plus the code which is getting restored isn't even very good.  For every
pagefault it populates a struct on the stack, passes that around for a
while, does a bit of RCU stuff only to find that there was nothing to do. 
Surely we should at least be doing something along the lines of
	if (unlikely(notify_page_fault_chain.notifier_call != NULL)) {
		all that crap
	}
But that's all speculation.  Has anyone actually measured the pagefault
latency impact of this change?

And this doesn't look very good either.  For how long did this fixme remain
unfixed?
So I'd suggest that we leave things as they are for 2.6.24 - mmiotrace
people will work something out, I'm sure.  For 2.6.25 if we merge mmiotrace
we can look at doing something which is vaguely efficient and tasteful.
