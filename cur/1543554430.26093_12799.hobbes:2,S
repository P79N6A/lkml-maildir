Thanks everyone!
I've discovered that it works with my USB scanner, but the IBMCAM
doesn't work at all with the usb-uhci driver. It works once with the
uhci driver. Subsequent access using xawtv causes instantaneous lock-up.
No oops, nothing. Just freezes the entire system. Not even the keyboard
responds (can't toggle capslock, etc). Needless to say, magic sysrq
didn't work.
I've got another machine; I'll see if I can get a serial port dump to
report.
This was with 2.2.17 + pre-patch-2.2.18-21 on an Athlon 600.
