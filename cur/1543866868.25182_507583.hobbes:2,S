The network configuration utilities can help there. In addition,
Suspend2 preserves the commandline you used to boot with
(/sys/power/suspend2/resume_commandline), so you can use a combination
of slightly varying grub entries (I have one for not starting ath0 and
one for starting it) and scripts to do different things in different
environments. The resume_commandline is writable, so can be cleared
after usage if there were anything sensitive there.

People are using Suspend2 with encryption today (I'm not sure about
uswsusp). Some of them have set things up so you need to use a
passphrase or usb key to resume, and the image itself is of course
encrypted too.
You could also close the document and not the app. Or both and just get
the benefit of having the app in page cache post-resume.

I guess the thing you're highlighting to me is the lack of awareness of
the options that are available. Maybe I need to work harder at making
people aware of the possible usage scenarios! :)
