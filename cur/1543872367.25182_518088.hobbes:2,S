Why would this be included in the generic i2c.h header file? As far as
I can see this structure only makes sense for bit-banged I2C busses, so
this structure should be declared in i2c-algo-bit.h.
Also, this structure alone isn't very useful. I'm waiting to see
drivers actually making use of it before I will consider merging this
patch at all.

What's the point of these?
