The current code does its best to figure out what modes are available and 
tries to pick a good one for each display.  It sounds like you're mainly 
concerned with the actual mode picking, not the mode and output detection 
and enumeration?  If so, that's a pretty easy change to make.  But if 
you're also worried about the kernel building mode lists, then we'll have 
bigger changes to make...

I'm not really sure how much of a problem broken EDIDs will be.  The X 
server only has a few quirks for broken EDIDs now, nothing major afaict, 
and apparently the FB layer already has some code for handling EDID 
quirks, so I don't think that'll be our biggest problem.  So far, it looks 
like handling laptop panels is a bit trickier (at least for Intel 
chips)...
