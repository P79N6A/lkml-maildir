Usually, the shared IRQ is disabled but it has happened that the system 
boots without disabling the IRQ. In that case, the sound is distorted 
and the distortion increase when I use the device that shares the IRQ.
(see the boot messages: 
http://olivn.trollprod.org/irq_not_disabled_sound_distortion.dmesg
 )
I can boot the system with pci=nomsi without any problem.

Weird,
MSI is enabled, but chip still send int to ioapic.
