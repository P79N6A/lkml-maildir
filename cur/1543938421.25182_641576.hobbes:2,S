I'd tried to advocate SIGDANGER some years ago as well, but none of
the kernel maintainers were interested.  It definitely makes sense
to have some sort of mechanism like this.  At the time I first brought
it up it was in conjunction with Netscape using too much cache on some
system, but it would be just as useful for all kinds of other memory-
hungry applications.
Cheers, Andreas
