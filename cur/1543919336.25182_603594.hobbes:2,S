Subject: [PATCH] Make m68k cross compile like every other architecture.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Rob Landley <rob@landley.net>
Rip out hardwired cross compiler name assumption that only m68k makes.
Signed-off-by: Rob Landley <rob@landley.net>
---
When you cross compile, you have to set the prefix CROSS_COMPILE to your
cross compiler prefix.  You need to do this for all targets (arm, mips, ppc,
x86-64 on x86, etc).  This is not specific to m68k, and this value is
supplied _to_ the build, not supplied _by_ the build.
The build shouldn't unconditionally overwrite the existing value of this
variable with one it makes up.  It has no idea what I called my cross compiler.
