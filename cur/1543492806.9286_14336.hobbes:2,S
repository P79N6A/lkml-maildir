Even then, it's completely bogus and should be ignored.
A general guideline that's usable is to allocate 8M or the amount
required to top up your RAM to 64M, whichever is greater, rounded up
to the next complete cylinder value ABOVE the relevant figure.
Alternatively, one that says to allocate 124 megs of swap could easily
be honoured on well over 90% of current systems without ever noticing
the reduction in drive data capacity, and will normally produce much
better performance than the 1.5-rule stands a chance of doing. Since
the maximum size of a swap partition is 126 megs, this basically takes
the worst case requirement and assumes such will occur.
Granted, this will normally overstate the amount of swap needed, but
as stated in my original post, too much swap is not a problem whereas
too little really hurts performance...

In my experience, the BIG problem with the current 'rule' as presented
is that people accept it as a hard and fast rule, so never consider
whether their system is under-performing as a result of

I'm well aware of that. The problem is that the 'guideline' offered is
plain unrealistic, and if one is going to be offered, then one that at
least stands a chance of being realistic should be offered.
Best wishes from Riley.
