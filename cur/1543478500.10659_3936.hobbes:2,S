This is a behavior want by Linus I guess. But since the init scripts are
used to send a SIGTERM and SIGKILL I think it's better to have it
unkillable. Sync with my latest arca-vm-24 and you'll have it unkillable.
kswapd will flush signals every second. If you send a signal to it, you'll
wakeup it though.
