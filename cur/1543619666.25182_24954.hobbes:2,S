But "flushes all pending io" is *far* from trivial. there's no current
kernel functionality for this, so you'll have to do "weird shit" that will
break easy and often.
Also "suspending" is rather dangerous because it can deadlock the machine
(think about the VM needing to write back dirty data on this LV in order to
 make memory available for your move)...
