No. "Secondary" streams will be clearly identifiable as such; new versions
of tools (ls, GUI file managers etc) can default to ignoring these files
as needed. This is not true of the hideous "files become directories"
kludge.

This seems a bit out of context - these aren't resource forks.

The filesystem in question (NTFS) has a completely different approach.
There is an obvious and correct way to implement NTFS-style streams under
Linux - the way I'm advocating. HFS's resource forks are already
implemented - but they are a completely different approach to a completely
different problem.
NTFS's streams are not HFS resource forks, although they can be used to
emulate the latter if needed. Similarly, NTFS streams are NOT OS/2 HPFS
EA's - NTFS supports them as well, and they are not related in any way to
streams.
Three completely different systems: HFS resource forks, NTFS streams,
HPFS/NTFS Extended Attributes. The first has already been dealt with; the
second has a very obvious solution. The latter needs a bit more thought -
if we really need to support this rather odd HPFS feature?
Apart from anything else, whatever solution you take for NTFS will end up
being mapped (in userspace if necessary) into my approach for almost every
use of NTFS streams. Why reinvent the wheel?
James.
