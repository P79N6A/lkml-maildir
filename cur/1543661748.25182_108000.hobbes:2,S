Any suggestions as to how it could happen?
The box is running huge compile jobs (>100MB memory used by each
compiler - runs 2-3 compilers concurrently) all day long - we never had
a GCC sig11 error. It has 512 MB of ECC memory (and ECC is enabled) - I
seriously doubt that we have a memory corruption problem.
The panic has happened once, just today.
I will be happy to try other solutions, but I can't verify whether they
work - I mean, if the box runs another few months without crashing that
doesn't really prove anything...
Thanks for commenting!
