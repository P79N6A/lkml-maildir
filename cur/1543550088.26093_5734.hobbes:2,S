Here in Spain a good number of ISPs are extremely reliable.  They must be,
since they have the habit of upgrading or going through "scheduled"
maintenance. ;)
And you don't even want to hear about usenet, radius, disconnections, or
cable/adsl deployment.  Once T, _the_ phone co lost connectivity to the rest
of the world, and they said a excavator had cut the fiber.  I emailed their
backbone provider and found out that T decieded not to keep the contract,
so their provider cut them off.  (Eventually newspapers called it the "ghost
excavator":)
Umm... back to on-topicness :)
