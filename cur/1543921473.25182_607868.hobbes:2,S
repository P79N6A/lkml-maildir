NACK.  Your patch degrades the random UUID by a bit, for no good reason.
The part of Section 4.1.6 which you quoted only applies to version 1
UUID's --- i.e., MAC and time based UUID's.  Random uuids are version
4 UUID's, and are already distinguished from version 1 UUID's by the
high 4 bits of the time_hi_and_version field, in octets 6-7 of the
URL.  Hence, there is no danger of conflict.  If you had looked 3
paragraphs later section 4.1.6:
   For UUID version 4, the node field is a randomly or pseudo-randomly
   generated 48-bit value as described in Section 4.4.
And the summary can be found in Section 4.4 of RFRC 4122:
4.4.  Algorithms for Creating a UUID from Truly Random or
      Pseudo-Random Numbers
   The version 4 UUID is meant for generating UUIDs from truly-random or
   pseudo-random numbers.
   The algorithm is as follows:
   o  Set the two most significant bits (bits 6 and 7) of the
      clock_seq_hi_and_reserved to zero and one, respectively.
   o  Set the four most significant bits (bits 12 through 15) of the
      time_hi_and_version field to the 4-bit version number from
      Section 4.1.3.
   o  Set all the other bits to randomly (or pseudo-randomly) chosen
      values.
   See Section 4.5 for a discussion on random numbers.
