Also, don't name the local version something like
2.6.13-rc6:e63b6d5ac1e17d0d9e5112bd9c0e5f17199b23da otherwise LILO
complains.  For example, this bit in lilo.conf
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.12:b5e43913cfe95a18ad8929585a0bb58e46cf3390
        label=bisect1
produces when you run lilo:
  :BIOS syntax is no longer supported. Please use a DISK section
  Fatal: Not a number: "b5e43913cfe95a18ad8929585a0bb58e46cf3390"
So in my kernel tree used for bisections, 'localversion' contains
-b5e43913cfe95a18ad8929585a0bb58e46cf3390
I don't fully understand when git (doing the checkout that is implict
in git bisect) will overwrite or not overwrite local files, or when it
will create files not in a previous version, or delete files not in a
current version.  So, to be sure I'm getting a clean compile from
exactly the source files I want (probably overkill), I use 'git
bisect' to get the SHA1 id's, and then do:
#!/bin/bash
sha1=`cat .git/HEAD`
dest="/usr/src/bisect/$sha1"
cg-export $dest $sha1
cp dot-config-to-test $dest/.config
cd $dest
echo "-$sha1" > localversion
# accept defaults for all new config options:
yes "" | make oldconfig
make -j 4 >& compile.log &
