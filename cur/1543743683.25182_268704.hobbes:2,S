Uhh ?
What are you smoking ? We all have the fastest computers we can buy, and
since a kernel still takes a few minutes to compile on those computers,
we try to use the fastest compilers to save *HOURS* at the end of the day.
Nobody ever claimed that we all spend our time compiling on the target
system. I wonder if thas would be possible on a 16 MB/200 MHz MIPS ;-)
That's it.
