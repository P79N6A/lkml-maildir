In this case though, it's not just bad, it's exceptionally bad.
Taking the 5 boxes I currently have powered up as test cases..
Old quad ppro
- Wierd compaq thing, no DMI tables. So won't do a thing here.
Athlon (one of the original ones), no ISA slots
- Correct DMI tables.
Vaio laptop
- Reports what is probably its PCMCIA slot as an ISA slot
Cyrix III box, no ISA slots
- Reports 4 slots present
K6 box, with ISA slots
- Reports none.
1 in 5 gets it right. Are the odds really worth the hassle
just to keep Aunt Tillie happy ?
