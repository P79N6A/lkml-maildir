It's usefull for the expand function - but with kiobufs as secondary data
structure it may no more be nessesary.

E.g. in the block IO pathes the pages have to be locked.
It's also used by free_kiovec to see wether to do unlock_kiovec before.

In the current buffer_head based IO-scheme it is used to determine wether
all bh request are finished.  It's obsolete once we pass kiobufs to the
low-level drivers.

Ok. Then we need an additional more or less generic object that is used for
passing in a rw_kiovec file operation (and we really want that for many kinds
of IO). I thould mostly be used for communicating to the high-level driver.
/*
 * the name is just plain stupid, but that shouldn't matter
 */
struct vfs_kiovec {
	struct kiovec *	iov;
	/* private data, mostly for the callback */
	void * private;
	/* completion callback */
 	void (*end_io)	(struct vfs_kiovec *);
 	wait_queue_head_t wait_queue;
};
