I can't duplicate this. Can you check you don't have
config SERIAL_8250_DETECT_IRQ
        bool "Autodetect IRQ on standard ports (unsafe)"
        depends on SERIAL_8250_EXTENDED
        help
          Say Y here if you want the kernel to try to guess which IRQ
          to use for your serial port.
          This is considered unsafe; it is far better to configure the
IRQ in a boot script using the setserial command.
          If unsure, say N.
