ok, didnt know about that.

we watch out for this, but still, about 50% of the cases, the 
realization "this should be backported" comes later on. Often because 
fixes get applied with low latency, and testers lag in realizing that 
some particular -stable problem is fixed by a -git fix. Sometimes people 
do bisection in search of backportable fixes - that too has a lag.
so the more formal:
    Backport-suggested-by: commit-id, person
entry would solve both cases. Also, a commit entry in -stable:
    Backported-from: commit-id
would finish the transaction. [ But this is clearly something that the 
-stable folks have to request - it wont help much if we start doing it 
but the -stable folks ignore the entries :-) ]
