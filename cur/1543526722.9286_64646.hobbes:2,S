You are wrong here :-) LOTS of daemons DO NOT have suid/sgid bit but
should be modified anyway. For example apache: it starts from root, then
bind to 80 port and after fork drop capabilities by changing uid. In
"trusted Linux" apache should be suid apache and will have capability to
bind on port below 1024 (it'll drop this capability after fork). Plus only
few selected users should have rights to execute /usr/sbin/apache (thus
you need ACL and capabilities in filesystem). More or less the same
changes are needed to sendmail and ftpd, pop3d and imapd... All mentioned
programs are not suid now...

Changes in filesystem should come first: you CAN change filesystemlayout
and cook up few test programs without capable-aware find(1), but you can
not make capable-aware find(1) if there are no capable-aware filesystem
and API for that filesystem (find SHOULD NOT and WILL NOT access
filesystem directly).
