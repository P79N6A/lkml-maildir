I didn't properly understand this. But you seem to be correct - now I
ran sparse check:
* using cpu_to_le16()
lib/lzo1x/lzo1x_decompress.c:141:35: error: incompatible types for

But still, how do I get rid of these two warnings? or, do these
warning suggest some real problem that still exist in code?
