Hi Doug
I've followed this thread as best I can and I have a query...
I have a Dell SC420
Is there a way (based around this patch) to allow users to enable and
set the auto-power-on BIOS feature?
(ie tell the BIOS to power on at 3:40am, power the system down, watch it
power up at 3:40am)
Normally I'd use 'nvram-wakeup' but it dosen't understand the Dell BIOS.
If so what I'd _like_ to do is send a patch to nvram-wakeup that tests
for this capability and uses it if it's there.
David
