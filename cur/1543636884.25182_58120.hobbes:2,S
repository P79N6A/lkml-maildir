Hi All,
Latest uClinux (MMU-less) patches up at:
http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/uClinux-2.5.x/linux-2.5.27uc0.patch.gz
I had to do a little hacking around the reverse mapping.
Probably needs more testing, but seems to work ok for now.
Still tracking down an existing problem where the mmnommu
page_alloc is occassionaly giving out a memory address as
free memory that is really in use...
Evertyhing else seems to work well (at least on the 5272 ColdFire
target board that I have tested on!)
Regards
Greg
