Support for CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_NAT was removed from the kernel - it has been
broken by some networking changes, and nobody bothered to fix it.
See this thread in linux-netdev:

You can use netfilter (iptables etc.) for NAT and more, but probably it
will consume more resources than the old "route nat" code.
