My first test run with lame at nice 0 was truly horrid, but has _not_
repeated, so disregard that as an anomaly.  For the most part, it is as
you say, things just get slower with load, any load.  I definitely am
seeing lurchiness which is not present in mainline.  No audio problems
with either kernel.

It seems to be a plain linear slowdown.  The lurchiness I'm experiencing
varies in intensity, and is impossible to quantify.  I see neither
lurchiness nor slowdown in mainline through -j8.

Absolutely, all test results count.
