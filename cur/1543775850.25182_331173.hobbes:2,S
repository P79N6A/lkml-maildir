Good question ...
The number and type of parameters is variable, so we can't 
easily do it with ONE static inline function.
seop is the function call including parameters, as is def.
Which means that the idea won't work the way I suggested in
the email. We'd need a three arg version, one for the security_ops
function name, one for the cap version and one for the arguments.
Best,
