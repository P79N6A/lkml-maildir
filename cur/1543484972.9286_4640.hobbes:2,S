Well, I came along these problems half a year ago - but the bad
news is that I havnt got it work. My setup is quite different, but
the problem is probably the same. I tried to load the image with
a tftp capable boot-rom, but for strange reasons the tftp code
fills the image downwards from the place where the initial loader
(i.e. the kernel one that reads from the "floppy") copies itself,
so after some bytes of loading the image it gets itself... whoops.
To address this problem, you should look into making the whole
load/decompress thing more configurable (i.e. configurable buffer
addresses, even loading a non-compressed image would be working
if using bzImages).
Richard.
btw. H. P. Anvin was quite helpful in tracking down/commenting
my thoughts about this. You may also ask the lilo/syslinux authors
about this.
