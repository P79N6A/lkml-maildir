Please don't.  It adds much less than I misremember (only 550 bytes
to my i386 PAE config), but even so it's a waste of space.  If you
really believe information is going missing there, just put a WARN_ON(1)
into p[gum]d_clear_bad in mm/memory.c.
(And remove the __FUNCTION__ and __LINE__ from the p[gum]d_ERRORs in all
the architectures if you're very industrious - I was too lazy for that.)
But I'm afraid that 95% of the cases will just turn out to be from
unmap_page_range below exit_mmap, and even the other 5% will just tell
when the corruption was first observed, giving no hint of what caused
it sometime earlier on.
(Of course, I was emboldened to make those changes because the messages
had never been seen in living memory, beyond our own private development
screwups.  They started appearing just around the time I changed them.)
