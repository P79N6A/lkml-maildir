hmmm, yes.  :)
We have a PCI network interface, developed by Martin Mares.  Donald does
not use that interface, instead choosing to use his own.
We have a kernel resource allocation interface.  Donald's code uses it
very poorly, which causes problems throughout the system because it is
impossible for hotplug to allocate resources correctly [when the view of
the system is not complete].
We have a kernel SMP interface, spinlocks, semaphores, and so on. 
Donald's drivers do not use this, and as a result often have severe
problems with SMP boxes.  I know, I have fixed all of these bugs in his
code.
This is one reason why infrastructure exists -- so that all drivers will
play nicely with each other.  Donald chooses to create his own
infrastructure, and as such makes the entire system more unstable
because of this.

So what?  Show me the code.  He updates his drivers very infrequently,
unless you consider August 1999 recent.

If you want to change the kernel core, you discuss it on linux-kernel
not linux-tulip.

If you want to work with the Linux kernel, you work with Linus and the
other kernel developers.  No man is an island, ESPECIALLY when you are
talking about the most popular net drivers in the Linux world.

I don't, I save all the bug reports and reply privately to some of them.

No, his code was not merged because it was BROKEN.  And he ignored
problems with it sent to him publicly and privately.

EVERY DAMN ONE OF THEM.  He gets CC'd on all my patches to Linus, and
sometimes gives helpful feedback.  If he doesn't incorporate changes
e-mailed directly to him, that is his (and his users') tough luck.

He has no solution for 2.4.0 stable kernel.  Even his attempt at 2.3
drivers are now woefully out of date and won't even compile.

If there is a problem in the stable series that is not being addressed,
yell and scream and wave your arms.
If there is a problem in the development series, sure that might take
more time to get fixed.  That's the nature of the kernel development
series.
