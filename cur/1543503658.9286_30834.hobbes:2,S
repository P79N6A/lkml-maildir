That's easy to say --- but what do you think is wrong with it?  The
aging algorithm is only one small part of the VM performance, remember.

RSS limits, properly implemented, won't do that.  The surplus will be in
cache but not in the page tables, so it will be a little slower to
access than the RSS pages.  It won't be totally evicted from memory
leaving unused pages lying around.

That's why you have per-user process limits.  We already honour those.
