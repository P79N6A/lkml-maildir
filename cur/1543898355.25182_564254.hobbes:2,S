Hi
I plan to hire a famous, professional Linux software
development team or company to port the whole Linux
Kernel and device drivers to a new type of CPU and
hardware, with fixed budget and a time limit.
What is the name of the professional, experienced
software company or team familiar with Linux Kernel
programming?
Thank you.
