The submitter can go public anyway.  Most coordinators do not require
signing NDAs for submitters (some require them from software authors,
though).
A designated security contact would give submitters a choice: either
go public directly, or try something else first.  And believe, some
vulnerabilities really need a tested fix which is published at the
time of disclosure (death by single packet, for example).
