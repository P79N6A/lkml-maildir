I think it's a wrong approach.  Instead of this collection of
dependencies we should bite the bullet and put
config HAS_GENERIC_FDC
	bool
	default y
in arch/*/Kconfig of platforms that do have it and
config BLK_DEV_FD
	tristate "Normal floppy disk support"
        depends on HAS_GENERIC_FDC
in drivers/block/Kconfig.  That way we can express such dependencies
sanely without bringing all the gory details in one pile.
I'll do that unless there are serious objections...
