This is interesting. First of all, the applications: this is relatively
straightforward. So long as the apps don't link against any GPLd libraries,
or include any GPLd code, there's no problem (libc, for example, is LGPLd,
so that's OK). Linus' note at the top of linux/COPYING states that he does not
consider a program which communicates with the kernel via syscalls to be a
'derived work'.
Kernel modules, whether loadable or compiled in, are a different matter (but
I'm Really Not A Lawyer). My understanding is that if you link (statically or
dynamically) against a GPLd library, your code is a derived work. As kernel
modules are linked to the kernel, I'd imagine that they are, therefore,
derived works. Regardless of the linking issue, 99% of modules are going to
use the kernel headers, which are AFAIK also GPLd.
Having said all this, it's up to the copyright holder(s) to set and enforce
the license(s). I guess Linus holds the copyright on a lot of the core stuff
(i.e. the bits a driver would actually be linking against), but grep'ing for
"Copyright" in, say, linux/fs produces some files which don't claim to be
copyright Linus, or (more interestingly) which have multiple copyright
messages.
So Linus, for example, could say that he doesn't consider modules to be
derived works. But others who have contributed code, and therefore hold the
copyright on those bits, might disagree, which could get nasty.
Perhaps this should be clarified with another note at the top of
linux/COPYING, so people contributing code know where they stand.
Did anyone ever set up that linux-legal list, so we can move this there? I
don't want to piss off the regulars <g>
