Hmm. It's part of glibc 2.x so it should be discussed on glibc's mailing
lists (see 
http://sourceware.cygnus.com/glibc/
 for more info)... Kernel
changes (if they are really needed) should be discussed also @ l-k, of
course...

It's kernel-thread library (based on clone).

There are few. Both kernel-threads based and userspace versions exists.
LinuxThreads is most common though. But if by "POSIX threads" you mean
"POSIX threads with all OPTIONAL bells and whistles" then answer is "NO".
There are NO threads library with all OPTIONAL features implemented.
LinuxThreads (and others) implement all REQUIRED features but not OPTIONAL
ones.

Reason is simple in fact: Linux do not need any certificates :-) So only
usefull things from different specifications are implemented. When
something is REALLY usefull or easy to implement it's implemented.
If not - then not.

They are implemented this way but if you are thinking about such changes
then you must have VERY VERY strong arguments for ANY changes in sheduler.
And no "it's defined by POSIX so it should be implemented" is not strong
argument. It's not even weak argument :-) It's not argument at all. The
ONLY arguments here are NUMBERS. You should be ready to show REAL-WORLD
example where such changes are needed to improve something (speed,
responsibility, etc) and last but not least where there are NO NATURAL WAY
TO SOLVE PROBLEM WITHOUT INTRODUCING such new concept. Linux developers
are VERY fast in adding features as far as said features do not affect
innocent code :-) But when feature affects "common path" task immediately
become MUCH harder: for example STREAMS support was rejected by that
reason (even if there are exist implementation and some important programs
where STREAMS are used :-)
