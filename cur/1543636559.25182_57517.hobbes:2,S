Reporting that both the IBM Thinkpad A31 and the Thinkpad T30 does not 
survive a suspend-resume cycle when the X server is configured to run at 
AGP >1x mode. The machines suspend fine. But an attempt to resume the 
machine, freezes it (requiring a cold reboot).
Both machines have Radeon Mobility Chipsets.
AGP speed is set using ==> "Option        "AGPMode" "N" in 
/etc/X11/XF86Config-4
A note on XIG's website which might be relevant (seems to attribute the 
problem to APM):
   3.0-28 05/07/2002
       - corrected a problem that would cause multiple server
         invokations to hang on ATI chips.  This was related to the
         APM fix made in the previous version.
   3.0-27 05/06/2002
       - corrected a problem with APM whereby the AGP bridge would not
         be shutdown/re-initialized properly during APM events.  This
         could cause the server to lock in certain cases when the
         machine was 'woken up' after a suspend.
