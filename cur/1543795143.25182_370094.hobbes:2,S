No problem. Everything's fine.

From a POSIX user perspective, what's expected is that sigsuspend() shouldn't
be interrupted by uncatchable signal SIGSTOP. But let's forget SIGSTOP because
it's only used as a way to interrupt tasks when one is ptracing. My real
concern lies elsewhere.
First, suspending processes receiving a SIGSTOP because of ptrace_attach() go to
sleep in ptrace_stop() instead of being strictly stopped. Right ?
Step 1: the process was just attached by gdb
sigsuspend    t 00000000  1692  3584   3588          3590       (NOTLB)

When the attached process resumes execution in ptrace_stop() because the tracer
ask for it with ptrace(PTRACE_CONT), I see no way for her to go back to user
space. The process will loop directly back into schedule().
Step 2: the command 'call my_function()' is invoked in gdb
sigsuspend    S 0000000A  1692  3584   3588                     (NOTLB)

Call Trace:
 [<c010511b>] sys_rt_sigsuspend+0xed/0x108
 [<c02c9413>] syscall_call+0x7/0xb
=> the process resumed sigsuspend() instead of executing my_function() in user
   space, as other programs do. Is this behaviour consistent ?
I would see something like this to work:
while (1) {
	schedule();
	if (do_signal())
		return -EINTR;
	if (some_condition)
		return some_return_value;
}
but I don't have any idea on what could be the condition and the return value.

I didn't mention any version or arch since it seems to be the *standard*
design for sigsuspend() and rt_sigsuspend() on i386, x86_64 and s390 since
2.4.
Thanks.
