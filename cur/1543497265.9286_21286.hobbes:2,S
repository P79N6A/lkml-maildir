Subject: Multiple SCSI Hosts module autoloading?

Hi. I have a system with multiple SCSI busses. I need to know if I can
(through a scsi_hostadapter alias in my conf.modules) autoload more than
one scsi host driver.
So, say that I have a system with ide-scsi and ppa drivers. Is there a
way to autoload both host drivers when I access their respective
devices? Can I have two scsi_hostadapter aliases in my conf.modules?
Will that break things?
Thanks in advance.
