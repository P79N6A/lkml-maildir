Before I patched the kernel, I did some tests on the IBM AIX-Machines.
I find out that AIX also does ARP type checking. In my tests the
machine only accepted ARP type 1 an ARP type 6 packets on Ethernet.
ARP types of i. e. 4 or 5 are discarded. IBM refers here to RFC1042.

I looked through some RFCs to find out something about this behaviour.
There is the host requirements rfc [rfc1122] which says a little about
ethernet and IEEE802 encapsulation in Section 2.3.3. Here is a short
cut of this section:
----> snip <----
     2.3.3  Ethernet and IEEE 802 Encapsulation
         The IP encapsulation for Ethernets is described in RFC-894
         [LINK:3], while RFC-1042 [LINK:4] describes the IP
         encapsulation for IEEE 802 networks.  RFC-1042 elaborates and
         replaces the discussion in Section 3.4 of [INTRO:2].
         Every Internet host connected to a 10Mbps Ethernet cable:
         o    MUST be able to send and receive packets using RFC-894
              encapsulation;
         o    SHOULD be able to receive RFC-1042 packets, intermixed
              with RFC-894 packets; and
         o    MAY be able to send packets using RFC-1042 encapsulation.
         An Internet host that implements sending both the RFC-894 and
         the RFC-1042 encapsulations MUST provide a configuration switch
         to select which is sent, and this switch MUST default to RFC-
         894.
         Note that the standard IP encapsulation in RFC-1042 does not
         use the protocol id value (K1=6) that IEEE reserved for IP;
         instead, it uses a value (K1=170) that implies an extension
         (the "SNAP") which can be used to hold the Ether-Type field.
         An Internet system MUST NOT send 802 packets using K1=6.
         Address translation from Internet addresses to link-layer
         addresses on Ethernet and IEEE 802 networks MUST be managed by
         the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).
----> snip <----
So, why not to make linux accepting ARP type 6 on ethernet?
> Probably, we should remove check for address type at all,
> but it requires thinking and digging in docs.
hm, I don't know exactly!?
