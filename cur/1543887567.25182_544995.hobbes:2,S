Can you please pick up the ia64 support patch I posted as well?

Please don't make this always happen. c/mtime updates should be dependent
on the mode being used and whether there is visible change to the file. If no
userspace visible changes to the file occurred, then timestamps should not
be changed.
e.g. FA_ALLOCATE that changes file size requires same semantics of ftruncate()
extending the file, otherwise no change in timestamps should occur.
Cheers,
Dave.
