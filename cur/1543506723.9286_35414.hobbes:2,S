Check that you really have route to this address going to this interface.
Linux answers ARP only if the route goes via different interface.
Alexey Kuznetsov
PS. BTW:
1. Linux never answers duplicate address detection requests due to proxy arp.
2. NT DOES NOT make duplicate address detection.
3. NT does unsolicited ARP and the fact that it is confused by misconfigured
   proxy agent is serious (fatal, to be more exact) bug in NT.
