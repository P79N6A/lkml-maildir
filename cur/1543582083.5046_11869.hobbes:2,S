Subject: 2.4.1: TCP assertion failed

Moderately-high (couple hundred thousand hits a day) loaded web server 
running 2.4.1 (no other patches). I got this twice in the syslog after
15 days uptime:
KERNEL: assertion (tp->lost_out == 0) failed at tcp_input.c(1202):tcp_remove_reno_sacks
(between lots of "TCP: peer xxxx shrinks window xxxx:xxx:xxxxxx. Bad, what else
can I say?" which I understand are harmless)
Let me know if anyone needs more info/tests/etc.
