The math ends up the same, but for your version there is a window where
the lock isn't held and the count doesn't reflect reality.  I don't know
if anyone can race in and mess with the inode though.  It is still on
various lists, but if we're only in that part of generic_forget_inode
during unmount, the super semaphore will keep out most potential racers.
I need to read harder.

It goes negative in the invalidate_inodes run during unmount.  I
think Andrea's patch will solve that part, hopefully we'll know more
tomorrow.
