Ok which 2.96 compiler do you have. I need to get this one chased down since
its probably also going to be in the current gcc CVS branches heading for 3.0
2.96-69 should be ok (thats the one I've been using without trouble). The 
original one with RH 7.0 off the CD does miscompile a few kernel things.
