i disagree. Utrace is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to clean up the 
/huge/ ptrace mess. Ptrace has been a very large PITA, for many, many 
years, precisely because it was done in the 'oh, lets get this feature 
added first, think about it later' manner. Roland's work is a large 
logistical undertaking and we should not make it more complex than it 
is. Once it's in we can add debugging features ontop of that. To me work 
that cleans up existing mess takes precedence before work that adds to 
the mess.
