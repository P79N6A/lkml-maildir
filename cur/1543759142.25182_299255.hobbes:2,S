Hmm. How can I check on this? What should I look for?

/proc/interrupts reports different irqs for each ide device:
  5:    5018683          XT-PIC  ide4
 11:     167995          XT-PIC  ide2, eth0
 14:      39799          XT-PIC  ide0
 15:      10704          XT-PIC  ide1
The problems were weird. The fs I was copying from decided it was
corrupt. Unmounting the partition and trying an fsck reported that it
couldn't find the partition. After a reboot all was well and a fsck
reported no problems.
