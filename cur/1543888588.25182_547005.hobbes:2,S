Solution:
One device per crtc. You can then have two users, running consoles
or xservers on their crtcs, without having to involve root.
The crtc->output mapping must still be done by root of course.
This solution allow the useful case where the computer boots, the boot 
scripts
set up a crtc->output mapping. Then users log in through the
various consoles (using getty or xdm or similiar) using their grahphical
devices in whatever way they want.  A true multiseat setup.
And if one user needs to use all the screens for multi-display work?
Let root change the mappings, possibly through some sudo setup.
