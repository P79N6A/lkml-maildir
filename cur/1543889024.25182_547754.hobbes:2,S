Not sure. Not in an obvious way at least.
It also doesn't feel like "the kernel way". Generally you can
create/allocate an object, assign attributes to it, then activate it.
Couldn't it be done so that I can add sysfs stuff to a device after I
just initialized it? (but before I add it).

I've had a look at sysfs groups and the biggest beef I have with those
is that they're too low level. In order to use them I first need to
create device attributes, then create an array of pointers to each attr
member. It would be nice if I could just feed an array of device
attributes (i.e. I want wrappers).
