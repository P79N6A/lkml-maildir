I don't know what axe you are trying to grind but that's nonsense.  Yes,
I said when you start doing a clone the phones don't work but I never 
said "the only problem we have is that an out going clone causes problems".
That's clearly not true, there are incoming clones, pushes, outgoing pulls,
all sorts of HTTP traffic, etc.  
The problem is that you heard clone and you assumed that clone was the
ONLY source of traffic.  That's your problem, not mine, so don't go 
accusing me of spreading misinformation because you weren't thinking
or listening, please.
