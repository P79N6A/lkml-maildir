Hmm.. Sendfile can return other values than "count" (ie a partial read).  
This return value change makes "do_lo_receive()" lose that information. As 
such, the new do_lo_receive() is weaker than the old one.
If fixing the loop code to handle partial IO is too nasty, then I would
suggest doing maybe something like
	if (ret > 0 && ret != bvec->bv_len)
		ret = -EIO;
which at least makes a partial IO an error instead of making it a success 
case (the code as-is seems to think that any non-negative return value 
means that the IO was fully successful).

I'll apply the patch, it looks better than what is there now, but it might 
be worth fixing this _right_.
