Whoa, easy :-)  I just meant they're similar in that we discover PCI
root bridges and other PNP devices by traversing the ACPI namespace,
so unless we make special arrangements, we bind drivers to them at
roughly the same time.
I'll play with your insert_resource() idea and see if I can figure
something out.
