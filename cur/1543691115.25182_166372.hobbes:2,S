Subject: Unable to build tgafb.c in 2.6.0-test5 due to undefined color_table

I was trying to compile the tga framebuffer driver but there was a
compiler error saying that color_table was not defined. I grepped
through the drivers/video and include/video directories and did not find
a declaration. Was there a header file not included or code missing from
the driver? 
The result of doing 'make vmlinux':
alpha:/usr/src/linux-2.6.0-test5# make vmlinux
make[1]: `arch/alpha/kernel/asm-offsets.s' is up to date.
