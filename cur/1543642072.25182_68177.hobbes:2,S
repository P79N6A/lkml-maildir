I just snagged ac5-pre2, and noticed there isn't a PCI ID yet for the
intel network chipset built into the ASUS P4B533-E w/raid motherboard(bios
version 1008) I bought today.
  Bus  2, device   8, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: PCI device 8086:1039 (Intel Corp.) (rev 129).
I put
        { PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, 0x1039, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, },
just below the 0x1038 line in eepro100.c, and it works fine.
I assume the promise card is supported now, from browsing through the
changes.  I believe it's a 20276.
I didn't have problems with the ICH4 that others have reported on this
board, DMA mode works.  Does the usual complain about resource collisions
though.
