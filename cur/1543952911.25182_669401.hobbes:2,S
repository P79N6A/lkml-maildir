I also think that the current names are wrong. But even if we fix the
slot name of shpchp/pciehp, it doesn't ensure that slot names are same
among pci_slot.ko and the other hotplug dirvers.
BTW, I'm planning to suggest the patch for shpchp/pciehp to use slot
number as a slot name (as they used to do), and add a module option
to use the combination of bus number and slot number as a slot name
as a workaround for problematic platforms.
Thanks,
