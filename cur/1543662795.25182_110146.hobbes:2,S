In the "obvious" sense, -1UL is an oxymoron, as -1 is inherently signed,
and the "UL" says "unsigned".
It's aesthetic. It's a violation of what I consider good taste to
do signed bit twiddling on an unsigned value and/or vice-versa.
Regardless of what ISO and/or Linux may or may not support, the habits
ingrained in me wrt. portability say the assumption must not be made.
YMMV.
