THanks to Scott.
this worked 
Seems that some bug in keyboard code affects the kernel debugger to appear
to hang when exiting from 
kdb using the go command. 
suggestion was to rlogin from another system and do 
sh /etc/rc.d/init.d/gpm stop
sh /etc/rc.d/init.d/gpm start
this gets back control of the keyboard. looks like this does not happen if
you use serial console and 
works fine.
one could alternately use a script that does the above in a loop so you get
control immedley...
Cheers,

Plug-and-Play is really nice, unfortunately it only works 50% of the time.
To be specific the "Plug" almost always works.
