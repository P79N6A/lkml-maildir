I thought that was a pretty good change,  making the default permissions executable. After all, that's how FAT filesystems are mounted by default. I often wondered about that, -r-------- for regular files on the mounted NTFS volume.
I'm not at all interested in WINE (no desire to run Windows programs in Linux, I love the software I have) but I do sometimes store things on microsoft partitions and it's useful to be able to run an install script in place rather than copying the files and setting +x (e.g. Star Office installer .bin files)
By the way, I did try this new driver yesterday and did not experience any problems with it. I'm using this kernel right now.  Behaviour as expected. I don't know what version of mc they are talking about, but in my version of mc ("The Midnight Commander 4.5.51") I can use the view command on any file on the NTFS partition without it trying to execute the file. The files are all showing in green, with the asterisk.
