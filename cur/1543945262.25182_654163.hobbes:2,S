Hmmm...  There seems to be some confusion somewhere, probably because the
documentation there doesn't say which compiler you should use for what.  Can
you try this toolchain instead:
	i686-pc-linux-gnulibc2.3-x-am33_2.0-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
rather than the:
	i686-pc-linux-gnulibc2.3-x-mn10300-elf.tar.bz2
in the location:
	
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/gnupro/AM33/am33-04r2-5/tools/
Note that the MN10300 arch needs some patches to get it to compile due to some
changes that Linus merged that weren't in the -mm tree.
