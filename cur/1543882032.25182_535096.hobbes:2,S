Subject: [patch 4/7] SLUB: Conform more to SLABs SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN behavior
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/26/24

Currently SLUB is using a strict L1_CACHE_BYTES alignment if
SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN is specified. SLAB does not align to a cacheline if the
object is smaller than half of a cacheline. Small objects are then aligned
by SLAB to a fraction of a cacheline.
Make SLUB just forget about the alignment requirement if the object size
is less than L1_CACHE_BYTES. It seems that fractional alignments are no
good because they grow the object and reduce the object density in a cache
line needlessly causing additional cache line fetches.
If we are already throwing the user suggestion of a cache line alignment
away then lets do the best we can. Maybe SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN also needs
to be tossed given its wishy-washy handling but doing so would require
an audit of all kmem_cache_allocs throughout the kernel source.
In any case one needs to explictly specify an alignment during
kmem_cache_create to either slab allocator in order to ensure that the
objects are cacheline aligned.
