We have few solutions to deal with this:
a. Mark such workqueues not freezable for hotplug
b. If above is not possible, don't call flush_workqueue in DOWN_PREPARE
c. If above is not possible, send DOWN_PREPARE before freeze_processes()
I would prefer a solution in the above order listed.
Which caller are you referring to here? Maybe we can decide on the
option after we see the users of flush_workqueue() in DOWN_PREPARE.

I dont see problems for workqueue.c even if we follow option c. Do you
see any?
