I've personally not had any experience with any hardware raid other than the
mylex DAC960 family.
One thing that keeps me from using the linux raid sw is the fact it can't be
partitioned.  I thought about lvm/evms, but I'm unwilling to make an initrd to
set it up (mounting root).  Unfortunately boot loaders don't seem to support
anything other than raid1. (Mostly lilo, but I'm not sure grub would do this
either)
