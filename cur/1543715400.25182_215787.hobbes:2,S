But that still does not explain why RedHat AS3 works on the same machine 
with the same BIOS settings without specifying any acpi related 
parameters.  As far as I can tell, AS3 is using an older version of the 
ACPI code.  It reports "ACPI: Subsystem revision 20030619" when 
booting.  So barring some hack RedHat has in there,  clearly something 
has changed along the way to break things on this machine...
Thanks,
