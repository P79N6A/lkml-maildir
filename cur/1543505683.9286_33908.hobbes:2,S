I definitely would not say so. The ratio of MIPS per dollar is much better
for DSPs than what it is even for overclocked celerons. The reason
winmodems are popular is because many people are overbuying their CPU.
Fact is that 'megaherzes sell'. You read in the ads '550 Mhz Pentuim III
computer!', you're not reading '1600MIPS DSP Included!'. Including a DSP
on a modem in a computer adds to the cost, but it doesn't sell any more
computers, which makes it senseless to do in our capitalist world... Until
people start asking for DSPs in their computers, which they currenly just
don't.
It's not overcharging by the DSP manufacturers, DSPs are used in many
economically effective ways in various high performance or embedded
applications. They just don't make much sense on a modem in a PC.
