It's not. Further, the exact same hardware runs about 10 times faster with
an ISR in DOS-real mode showing that the port itself is not the dominant 
pole in the ISR bandwidth. Further, this was not a complaint, only a
_measured_ observation made independently by myself and an associate.
We needed to verify, by tests and measurements, what the interrupt
response time is, in preparation for an upcomming design review where we
put our jobs on the line as advocates of Linux instead of the Customer
required Windows-NT for a new project.
So I present my results and get hate mail from the world. This is
Bullshit.
