Sure thing, I'll add that to my must_do list :)
There seems to be very mixed feelings about this, so I think what I'll do 
is to pick a few files from different dirs and submit patches for them, if 
I then get positive feedback I'll do more in that dir, if not I'll just 
leave it.
Thank you for responding.
