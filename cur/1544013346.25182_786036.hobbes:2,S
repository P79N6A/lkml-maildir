Yes, we could (and maybe should) use __always_inline there. Hrm, which
which tree to you work ? You probably mean DECLARE_TRACE() rather than
DEFINE_TRACE() ?
I just went over your patch again. it uses the old DEFINE_TRACE() API.
You should get the latest tracepoints which have DECLARE_TRACE() (for
trace/kmemtrace.h) and then a DEFINE_TRACE() in a .c.  Ah I see, you
work on 2.6.28. You should work on top of -tip, which has this new API.
Using the tracepoints present in 2.6.28 will not let you do only a
single definition of the tracepoint structure and it will lead to waste
of kernel memory by defining multiple instances of tracepoint structures
(one for each trace_*() use, so one per kmalloc()). The
Documentation/tracepoints.txt file is updated accordingly.

Hrm ? In the case we just want
  trace_kmalloc(_THIS_IP, ......);
If we have __always_inline for the trace_*() declaration, isn't it the
same to just do this in the probe ?
void probe_kmalloc(......)
{
  ... _RET_IP_ ...;
}
This would remove a parameter from the stack created from the
instrumentation site, which is always good.
