Even worse, kconfig will complain about a circular dependency.
CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK
CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK
	depends on CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK=n
CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK will be visible if CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK is set, 
but as soon as CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK is set, CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK is 
automatically set to n.
