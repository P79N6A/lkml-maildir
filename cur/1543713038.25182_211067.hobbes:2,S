 How would softirq's scheduled be softirq's be run? 
 For a definitive solution a think Alexey analysis make sense:
 "All of them happening outside of ksoftirqd are equally bad, unaccountable,
 uncontrollable and will show up in some situation."
FYI. I did some more experiments:
Simple sycall test: user app = ank-time-loop (does gettimeofday in a loop)

So syscalls "in this context" seems to do_softirq() via irqexit.
Route DoS while BGP tables are loading. ank-time-loop is running.

Most softirq's are run from irqexit but we see local_bh_enable is running
softirq's too. And only a minority of softirq's is running under scheduler 
control. As discussed we before with 100Hz timer we would expect lower 
rates from irqexit.
Cheers.
