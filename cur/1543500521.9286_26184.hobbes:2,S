I really don't know, whether this is relevant, but something similar
happened to mee, too with 2.2.9. It may well be that it was not smbfs,
but here it goes. 
I had a directory mounted from another Linux machine (samba 2.0.2) to my
machine (2.2.9). My machine had been up for 31 days, and just when I
booted the samba machine, my machine locked up solid.
After reboot my ext2 fs was corrupted, but that I have discussed quite
extensively in another thread ;).
The machine locked up few days later (now running 2.2.10), but then I did
not boot any machines, so I really can tell whether the first lock up did
had anything to do with smbfs.

Samba 2.0.2 at the server end (and here, too).
