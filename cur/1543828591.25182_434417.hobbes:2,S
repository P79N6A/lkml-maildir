At a very broad-level, all the requirements pointed by Chandra below boil down 
to the requirement of providing guaranteed CPU usage for a group of 
tasks and the ability of limiting (hard or soft) CPU usage of other group of 
tasks.
At a finer-level, this broad requirement could be interpreted and implemented 
in a number of ways (ex: by having kernel support only task-level limit and
implementing group-level in user-space etc) and thats what this RFC was
about - to discuss what minimal kernel support would be needed to
support the above broad requirement!
