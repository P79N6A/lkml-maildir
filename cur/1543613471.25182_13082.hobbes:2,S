this is an icache/dcache problem, can you reproduce on 2.4.17rc1aa1, it
will shrink more aggressively.
really to get an even better balance we should add the icache/dcache
slab pages into the lru as well... that would trigger the icache/dcache
flushes more easily when too much ram is in those caches.
