Subject: Re: [patch 2.6.16-mm2 8/9] sched throttle tree extract - maximize timeslice accounting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch maximizes time slice accounting.  A task which receives too
much CPU time due to missing the timer interrupt will have the excess
deducted from it's next slice.
