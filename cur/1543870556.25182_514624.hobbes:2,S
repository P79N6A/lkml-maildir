I'll send you a message of the thread. You only have to answer it
(with reply-to function of your browser) changing the TO: address with
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org (you don't have to be subscribed, i'm not
for example) . Hopefully, it will maintaing headers and it will merge
with the rest of the thread.
Bye
