Hi Ingo,
Do you propose that we NOP out the entire function call stack setup and
other related inline functions and pointer dereferences that would be
needed by the call ?
I don't see how we can do this on optimized code without having
side-effects. So there, I think markers could have even less side-effect
than the dtrace NOPs, because I can jump over all the function call
preparation, which they can't. And branch prediction logic is cheap
nowadays, especially since this is a likely branch. However,
benchmarking the "real" impact of this becomes kind of crazy, because it
may depend on workloads, memory pressure, .... so it leaves us mostly
with microbenchmarks.
I also tried to use an unconditional jump to skip the function call, but
the problem here, as has been discussed about a year ago, is gcc : it
does not allow to jump getween two different inline assembly. And since
I don't want to create the a number of macros equivalent to the powerset
of the number of arguments/types we want to support (this is why I use
var args), and I don't see how we could declare var args in inline
assembly portably, I guess the best solution left was what I have done :
loading an immediate value and let gcc handle the conditional jump.
Mathieu
