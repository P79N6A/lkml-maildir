Precedence: bulk

Hi All,
The first two patches are from Mike and Steven on LKML, which the rest of my
series is dependent on.  Patch #4 is a resend from earlier.
Series Summary:
1) Send IPI on overload regardless of whether prev is an RT task
2) Set the NEEDS_RESCHED flag on reception of RESCHED_IPI
3) Fix a mistargeted IPI on overload
4) Track which CPUS are in overload for efficiency
5) Track which CPUs are eligible for rebalancing for efficiency
These have been built and boot-tested on a 4-core Intel system.
Regards,
-Greg
