That suggestion came up several times.  gluebi represents a compromise
between the two groups.  IIRC, the issue was that representing UBI volumes
as MTD devices only makes sense in the dynamic volume case.  Static UBI
volumes require special write/update handling and so there was a need for
a native interface anyway.

Yeah.  Unfortunately, SD/USB/CF cards are all in sort of an awkward spot
when it comes to things like that.  They don't expose the raw flash
underneath, and they don't provide any indication of how robust the
built in wear-leveling is.  Ugh.

Oh, believe me I know. :)

That just sounds like we need Jörn to get off his butt and finish logfs ;)
Seriously, until something like that is done we'll be stuck with some not
so pleasant solutions for these kind of devices.
