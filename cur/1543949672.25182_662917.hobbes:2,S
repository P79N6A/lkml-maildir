The question is how much it would be penalized. Most likely the penalty 
is very little. I would agree with Pierre's reasoning for enabling 
it by default: distributions will enable it anyways and it's better
to have the same defaults in the mainline kernel as with distros.
It might be worth researching a good default value though. Perhaps
it can be a lot shorter than the current one, lessing the penalty
even more?
