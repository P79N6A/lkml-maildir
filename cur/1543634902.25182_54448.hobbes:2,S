Hey, you mean it's suddenly become my problem...?
I think I can clean up the SCSI upper layer drivers so they speak request prep 
functions which would translate the request (or ioctl) into the correct SCSI 
command and hand it back as a REQ_SPECIAL by 2.6
In order for this type of thing to be acceptable to the IDE subsystem, the 
attachment can't be a Scsi_Cmnd structure like it is now.  The plans I have to 
take a struct request all the way down to a SCSI host adapter and get rid of 
Scsi_Cmnd will probably finally make it possible to attach the st driver 
directly to an IDE device but this definitely won't make it in time for 2.6.
