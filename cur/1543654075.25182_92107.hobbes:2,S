I have devfs, and my /etc/lilo.conf contains this:
boot=/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc
root=/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part4
I haven't tried to put this in a command line
option, but it works fine from lilo.
The reason fro the patch is that I couldn't boot
with devfs anymore, I'd get a 
"panic: couldn't mount root at 03:04"
or similiar, depending on which machine I used.
Now I don't get that, it just works.
Have you been able to boot a devfs-enabled
2.5.48 or later?  On a machine where /dev
is only a empty directory - a mountpoint
for devfs use?
