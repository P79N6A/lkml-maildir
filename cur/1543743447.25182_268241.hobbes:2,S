I recently had a system with serial console where some some reason the
serial port was stopped. This meant that init blocked while writing some
message (e.g. "respawning too rapidly"), and that meant it stopped
reaping those zombie processes. The list of these zombie processes with
PPID == 1 was amazing. The only thing that helped was rebooting after
replacing the serial console cable.
(Kernel 2.4.25, sysvinit 2.85 in case you're wondering.)
