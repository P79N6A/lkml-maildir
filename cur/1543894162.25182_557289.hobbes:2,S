The problem isn't Bugzilla, and the Debian BTS wouldn't solve any 
problem.
What is missing?
We need people who know one or more subsystems and who are willing to 
regularly handle bug reports in their area.
And we need a release process that makes debugging, and if possible 
fixing, all regressions prior to the release mandatory. You might never 
come down to zero regressions and might not be able to handle all 
last-minute reported regressions, but the 2.6.21 situation with 3 week 
old known regressions not ever being debugged by a kernel developer 
before the release has much room for improvements.
Changing the BTS would make sense if some core developers would state 
that they would start using the BTS after this change. But otherwise it 
doesn't matter which BTS to use.
