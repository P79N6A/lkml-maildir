The Ultra 2 Wide LVD one.

The IBM DRVS09V ... 9.1 GB Ultra 2 Wide LVD

Enabled, 16 commands.

Yes, it IDs the first controller, then the first scsi reset happens,
then it IDs the second controller, more resets, then panic.
-> What happens if you use the aic7xxx=no_reset flag on bootup?

from using it, but I'll try it and get back to you.
