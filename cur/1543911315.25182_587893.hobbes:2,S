Yes, it does, and this is sufficient, so the patch removes tasklist_lock.

Yes, this is optimization, but I strongly believe it is wrong. Please look
at the race description above.
!list_empty(&q->list) does _not_ necessary mean that q is not used and we can
free it. It is possible that collect_signal() just removed this sigqueue from
list (list_empty(&q->list) becomes true) and going to free it.
The whole point is: we can't check list_empty() without ->siglock, this is
racy, and leads to double-free.
Oleg.
