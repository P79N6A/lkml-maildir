Thanks a lot for the testing and feedback, Michael.

I presume it's going the drm_do_vm_dma_nopage route, and the pages
in the pagelist (though each PAGE_SIZEd itself) have been allocated
from >0-order pages.

Just when I thought I could get away from DRM!  I've spent a while
groping around there again, and I believe you're right that there
is an issue with drm_pci_alloc too, but that it's not a new issue.
Not a new issue because we've only been changing the behaviour of
PageReserved, and there was no PageReservation around drm_pci_alloc.
But an issue, yes, because pci_alloc_consistent is likely to supply
a >0-order page, with latter constituent 0-order pages having count 0.
Hmm, could this have caused some of my mm/rmap.c BUG_ONs in the past?
Not very likely, I think; but it's not immediately obvious quite how
it would have behaved; certainly "Bad page states" a possibility
(even before the recent changes).
Below is a cowardly patch which I believe will correct this: since
nopage will be a problem here, just go the remap_pfn_range way instead.
I'm not proud of coming up with different adhoc solutions to different
manifestations of the same underlying problem, but pci_alloc_consistent
depends on the architecture, I don't want to go there.  Uncompiled,
untested, see what you think.
Though two worries noticed on the way.  One, there's drm_addbufs_pci:
that's a bit confusingly named, isn't it, since it's working on the
DMA pagelist, and unrelated to drm_pci_alloc?  Two, is it right that
only _DRM_SHM and _DRM_CONSISTENT end up using drm_vm_shm_close,
which does cleanup which the others miss by using drm_vm_close?
No need to explain why I'm wrong! just mentioned in case it's wrong.

Thanks for looking after that, Dave.  Please take care of this one too,
if you agree it's the right thing to do...
_DRM_CONSISTENT memory is allocated in one range by pci_alloc_consistent,
and is therefore likely to be a >0-order page, whose constituent 0-order
pages should not be exposed to nopage and freeing: use remap_pfn_range.
