Hi all,
I have an embedded machine that needs a _tiny_ little bit more memory
for some of its tasks than it has.  Unfortunately, it does not have
an IDE or USB controller, but it does have a 10/100 and three gigabit
ethernet interfaces.
There have been a number of efforts in the past for making network
swapping (either via NFS or NBD) work without deadlocking, but most of
those projects appear to have been abandoned.  Is it just too hard to
get right?
Any info appreciated.
thanks,
Lennert
