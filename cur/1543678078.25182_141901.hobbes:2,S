This raises a new question. How about a port of Linux to the "VLIW" so 
that we can skip x86 "code morphing" interelly?
I'm sure that 1GHz would benefit from it. Is it possible, Linus?
After googling a bit i went to
http://216.239.57.100/search?q=cache
:GCP2Ecz931UJ:www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~fleiner/research.html+crusoe+linux+native+port&hl=en&ie=UTF-8
...But there isn't many more info. Is there any advantage?
Sorry for the OT... :)
