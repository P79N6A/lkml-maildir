Depend on the bridge implementation, special error handling of PCI-X would be
available in the case of a DMA error.
PCI-X Command register has Uncorrectable Data Error Recovery Enable bit to
avoid asserting SERR on error. Some bridge generates poisoned data and pass
it to destination instead of asserting error or passing broken data.
The device driver would be interrupted on the completion of DMA, and check
status register of controlling device to find a error during the DMA.
If there was a error, driver could attempt to recover from the error.
I don't know whether this is actually possible or not, and also there are
upcoming drivers implementing such special handling.
Though, when and how we should call drivers to do device specific staff is
one of the problem. My API would provide "a chance" which could be defined by
driver, at least.
Thanks,
