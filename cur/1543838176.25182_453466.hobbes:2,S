Works fine for me also.
Andrew, can you do the following:
	cat /proc/fs/nfsfs/*
And can you try mounting "bix:/" manually to see if that exhibits the same
problem?  It'd be useful to know if autofs is actually having an effect.
Also, can you do a module list and check that it's autofs4 that's being used,
and not autofs.  It would be handy if we could rule out an adverse interaction
between nfs and autofs4.

But what does it actually show?  Do you know where the bug is then?  (I don't
know exactly how bisection works).
