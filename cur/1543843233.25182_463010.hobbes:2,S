Another issue that occurred to me last night is that the size of
objects allocated with SLOB's slab-like API are implicit and not
calculable from the object. kmalloc'ed objects, in contrast, have a
header that contains the object size.
So ksize(kmalloc(...)) works, but not ksize(kmem_cache_alloc(...)). I
don't know if anything in the kernel is using the latter aside from
kobjsize.
