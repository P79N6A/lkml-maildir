Release 2.1.2: Fri Jan 11 03:50:36 EST 2002
	* Resync with 2.5.2-pre11.
	* Properties introduced.  Symbols can now have associated class flags.
	  to be used by configurator programs.
	* Frozen symbols are no longer visible.
Checkpoint release.  The compiler has just undergone major surgery, so this
one may be a bit buggier than typical recently (though it passed all my
standard tests).  I'm in the throes of introducing property-annotation 
macinery for use by the autoconfigurator.
