OK.  There was talk some months ago about making the non-linear vma's
effectively mlocked and unswappable.  That would reduce their usefulness
significantly.  It looks like that's off the table now, which is good.
btw, mincore() has always been broken with nonlinear vma's.  If you could
fix that up some time using that pagetable walker it would be nice.  It's
not very important though.
