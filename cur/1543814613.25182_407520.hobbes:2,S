Subject: [PATCH] Dont create a control file for BSP that cannot be removed

Hi Andrew
this patch just doesnt create an online file if the logical cpu cannot be
offlined.
We originally added to support ppc64 if the kernel has support but BIOS indicated
no offline support, we just didnt create online files for them.
We used the same method in ia64 as well, if we have a cpu taking platform interrupts
but cannot be removed if those interrupts cannot be re-targeted to another cpu.

Don't create "online" control file for BSP (i386/x86_64) since its
not removable.
