   In which case they would benefit from net/shut_up sysctl. In lots of
   environments they will just be a pain
   
Keep in mind we have these kinds of messages in 2.4.x right this

to shut them off.
See net/socket.c:sock_create() for example.
Now, I'll all for netratelimit()'ing the networking ones.
