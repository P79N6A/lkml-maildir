Subject: [Patch] ibmvscsi compatibility fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linda Xie ever so gently pointed out that she had a patch
to preserve compatibility with older SLES targets, and I told
her we didn't need to push it to mainline.
This patch explicitly checks the version of the IBMVSCSI target
and ensures that large scatterlists are not sent to older 
targets.
Andrew, while this stuff usually goes through James, it would
probably make Serge happier if you could pick it up for the next
mm.
