Subject: RH6.0 (glibc 2.1.1-6) + kernel 2.2.10 SMP == SEGV in spinlock.c

I am not sure if this is a kernel , clib or compatability question,
I hope someone has experienced this before and knows a fix.
Under stock RH6.0 + 2.2.10 SMP when I run
a program with threads very heavly competing for
a mutex I get segfault ... gdb sez in spinlock.c.
The program is happy under RH5.2 on a uniprocessor...
also happy on Suns (uni and smp)...purify (on sun)
gives it a clean bill of health.
Can I upgrade something and fix this?
Thanks in advance.
Russ
