Another suggestion - if you have your heart set on using ping
as your network stress tool, you may want to try using multiple
instances of MTU sized pings versus  a single "ping -s 50000".
In this way you aren't involving any IP frag code and its associated
bean counting - giving us one less factor to consider.
Oh, and since you get a silent failure, maybe you would be interested
in testing this patch I was (originally) saving for 2.5.x. -- It adds
watchdog transmit timeout functionality to 8390.c (which is used by
the ne2k-pci driver).  Last time I updated it was a couple of months
ago, but nothing has changed since then.
Paul.
