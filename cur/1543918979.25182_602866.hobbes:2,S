Ah, that was in the second patch (I didn't look at that. My fault). I
didn't see this description in the comments. But you are right, it is very
close to what I did too. But before we add this to -rt, it will need to
probably need to be tested quite a bit more. Especially since this is more
to help us developers than to help end users.
I would like to see something like this eventually make it into RT.  Just
because there has been too many times that this would be useful. For now I
just use the NMI watchdog and soft lockup detect. But those are very
limiting.
