The gspcav1 is not maintained anymore.
It seems that your webcam has not been tested with gspcav2.
First, did you use the v4l library and its wrapper when running xawtv
and gqcam?
Then, have you tried my program svv?
If nothing works, please, send me the kernel traces and the image.dat as
indicated in the gspca_README.txt of my page.
Best regards.
