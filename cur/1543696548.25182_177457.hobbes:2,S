| You need the new module-init-tools.  If you follow the instructions

The only thing to watch out for is that the "probe" functionality was
removed from the new package, which requires manual loading of the
modules and testing of the status. Inconvenient if you need to do it at
boot time, otherwise write a script. That feature typically was used
only when the hardware for the initial drivers might be nonfunctional
and and alternative was needed.
