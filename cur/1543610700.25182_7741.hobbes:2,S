This is a kernel bug.  It can be avoided by running as a user with no
filesystem limits.  Note that _any_ call to "ulimit" is currently
broken, especially "ulimit -f unlimited", which will actually impose
a 2GB file limit on the block device.  Remove any "ulimit" statements
from the system startup or root .bash* scripts, and you should be OK.
Cheers, Andreas
