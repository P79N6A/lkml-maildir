Hi,
I have a question about 3w-9xxx driver versions :
3w-9xxx version in vanilla 2.6.16 is 2.26.02.005
3w-9xxx version in 2.6.17-rc1-mm2 is 2.26.02.006
but :
3w-9xxx version in 3ware.com 9.3.0.3 codebase is 2.26.04.007
The documentation with 9.3.0.3 codebase says it will not works with
kernel driver <2.26.04.004. But I observe it works fine with codebase
9.3.0.2 (the documentation says it should not).
What is current status of 3w-9xxx driver in 2.6 ?
Will it works on a 9550SX using 9.3.0.3 firmware ?
Could you update documentation about that somewhere, for exemple in
3w-9xxx.c header ?
Thanks very much.
