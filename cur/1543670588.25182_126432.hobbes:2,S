That is something private to the NFS code.
The standard leaves the structure undefined, so whatever we do is OK.
It seems reasonable to allow some mount option to specify
whether the other side is Solaris-like, with 8:8 / 14:18,
or FreeBSD-like, with 8:24, or Linux like ...
Filesystems that are offered more dev_t bits than they can handle
must just return -EOVERFLOW.
