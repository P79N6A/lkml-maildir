The term "SPI slave device" looks correct.. I am correcting the doc :)

The spi_bus_populate is not the only way to populate the bus; the bus
driver can discover SPI devices on his own and directly call
spi_device_add, isn't it ?

You're right. Using spi_populate_bus is the simplest way, that may lead
to errors... From the other hand, if we used another char to delimit
device name and its parameters, there would be person who would want
this character in device name... I think that we can add another
approach to populate the bus ?

Yes; but I personally prefer to look to the only place instead of
spi.h/spi-core.c. I'll try to keep the things consistent :)

Thank you for this comment; the `clock' field is initially intended to
do this. Device driver might set the field to maximum speed, and bus
driver would analyze the field in its xfer function and send the message
on lower speed. Moreover, there is the `set_clock' callback in
spi_bus_driver. If msg specifies its own clock value, the bus driver's
set_clock will be called just before transferring the message.

Thank you! If your drivers are going to open source, could you also sent
them to spi mailing list, to prepare the consolidated patch ? I hope if
there is no significant troubles, the current core will go to the
mainstream kernel :)
