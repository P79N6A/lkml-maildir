It works fine here, cept i get that damn 
ld: bvmlinux: Not enough room for program headers (allocated 2, need 3)
ld: final link failed: Bad value
error now when i compile on tmpfs that i didn't get when i compiled on the 
hdd with 2.4.10-acX.  It's only started happening since using 2.4.12-ac3.  
I've only used this kernel so i dont know if it's 2.4.12 or the ac3 part.   
anyways it got to that point in about 3:30 seconds . . which is about 5 
seconds faster than disk.
