Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 10, 2005 at 09:13:19PM CEST, I got a letter

Ok, I decided to stop this nsec madness (since it broke show-diff
anyway at least on my ext3), and you get it only if you pass -DNSEC
to CFLAGS now. Hope this fixes things for you. :-)
BTW, I regularly update the public copy as accessible on the web.

You still need to extract the file by cat-file too. ;-) And rm the files
after it compares them (so that we don't fill /tmp with crap like
certain awful programs like to do). But I will conditionalize the mkdir
calls, thanks for the suggestion - I think that's the last bit to be
squeezed from this loop (I'll yet check on the read proposal - I
considered it before and turned down for some reason, can't remember why
anymore, though).
Thanks,

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
