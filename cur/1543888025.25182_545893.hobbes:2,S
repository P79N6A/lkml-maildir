Hi,
I found some time to investigate. My resume is:
- kernel/verify_cpu.S causes the stop at boot time
  Cause the required flag for CMPXCHG8B is not set.
- boot/setup.S did not print "PANIC: CPU too old for this kernel"
  ( not visible, also the message did not match )
- VIA C3_2: CMPXCHG8B should work always. Via C3 EBGA Datasheet R1.90 page 30 (3-4)
  But the bit is not set cause of some early Win NT bugs.
- X86_CMPXCHG64 can be set and used. Just verify_cpu.S requires a change
  to ignore the missing indicator at boot time.
My suggestion for the fix is:
- kernel/verify_cpu.S should be more tolerant if CONFIG_MVIAC3_2 is set
  ( see patch below )
- boot/setup.S should be fixed to print out a proper error message
  ( see below )
- X86_CMPXCHG64 patch(earlier mail in thread ) should not be used.
- Important: somebody to check other CPU types if the same behavior happens.
- middle term solution already planed: introduce arch/i386/boot/cpucheck.c
To be done by somebody with more detail knowledge than me: (never did x86 assembler before)
- I add "# missed before: set ds"
  => somebody should check if I am right with the way to set.
  => seems to be a generic error in setup.S not to set "ds" for error messages.
- other X86-CPU than AMD (?) or Intel
  => correct verify_cpu.S or set bits if required.
Best regards,
Christian
