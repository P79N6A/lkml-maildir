I think it is fair game to require bash to build the
kernel -- after all, GCC and GNU make are required
already, and bash has many helpful features that not
every POSIX shell has.

Yes, it would be ridiculous to require /bin/sh to be
bash.  Especially since bash is installed as /bin/bash
always :-)
