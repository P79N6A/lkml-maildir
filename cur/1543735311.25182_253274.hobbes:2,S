I realize now that this is very involved piece of code and a lot was
built around the assumption that IRQ0 is a timer interrupt (pin 0 is for
PCI on ES7000), and assumption that everyone honors this assumption :)
However, it seems wrong that we are not able to read literally what ACPI
says, such as irq 0 for INTA. Maybe, it would be better if the code
above was returing an error code, not an irq, which is returned in dev
anyway. It should be some creative way to resolve this issue... I think
the idea in the comment above by Jesse Barnes has good potential.  
Thanks,
