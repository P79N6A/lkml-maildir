it looks you can nuke most of those.

for example does this extra pointer really hurt in the *really* unlikely
case you don't have AGP ?

if you make a drm_core_has_AGP and drm_core_has_MTRR wrapper around
these then...

...this would NOT need an ifdef because drm_core_has_MTRR would be a
define to 0 for non-OS_HAS_MTRR machines at which point the compiler
removes the entire code. Eg no ifdef needed and the code gets more
readable.
