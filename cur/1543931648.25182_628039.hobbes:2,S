The option I added (which is set to Y by default, but that's another
matter) disables C1E without any other kernel parameter. In my opinion,
this should be the normal behavior: the kernel has both SMP and NO_HZ
enabled, so do whatever is necessary to enable dynticks. But it would
also be useful, for benchmarking purposes, to prevent the kernel from
disabling C1E using a kernel parameter; that's what force_amd_c1e does.

On my system, hpet=force does not enable dynticks:
$ dmesg | grep -E "(not functional|hpet)"
Command line: ro hpet=force
Kernel command line: ro hpet=force
hpet clockevent registered
hpet0: at MMIO 0xfed00000, IRQs 2, 8, 31
hpet0: 3 32-bit timers, 25000000 Hz
Time: hpet clocksource has been installed.
Clockevents: could not switch to one-shot mode: lapic is not functional.
Clockevents: could not switch to one-shot mode: lapic is not functional.
hpet_resources: 0xfed00000 is busy
But, using this patch, the kernel enables dynticks.
