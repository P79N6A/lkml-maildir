Loads for process_load is the number of iterations each load manages to 
succeed doing divided by 10000. Loads for mem_load is the number of times 
mem_load manages to access the ram divided by 1000. Loads for io_load is the 
approximate number of megabytes divided by 100 it writes during the kernel 
compile.  The denominator for loads was chosen to easily represent the data, 
and also correlates well with significant digits.
LCPU% is the load's cpu% usage while it is running. The load is started 3 
seconds before the kernel compile and takes a variable length of time to 
finish, so it can be more than 100-cpu%

So total cpu% being used during the kernel compile? The cpu% + lcpu% should be 
very close to this.  However I'm not sure of the most accurate way to find 
out average total cpu% used during just the kernel compile - suggestion?

That is clear, and also the reason I have a measure of work done by the load 
as well as just the lcpu% (which by itself is not very helpful).

I believe that is what I'm already showing with the time for each load == 
kernel build time, and loads==io work done.

Latest version of compressed cache. Note that in my testing of cc I used the 
optional LZO compression.

Sure, adding loads is easy enough. Just exactly what to add I wasn't sure 
about. I'll give those a shot soon.

Where time permits sure.
