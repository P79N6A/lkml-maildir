Hi,
I've just updated IDE quilt tree:
	
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/bart/pata-2.6/patches/
New patches:
* ide-floppy: Fix unformatted media crash
  (Alan Cox <alan@redhat.com>)
* ide: clear bmdma status in ide_intr() for ICHx controllers (revised #4)
* ide: remove clearing bmdma status from cdrom_decode_status() (rev #4)
  (Albert Lee <albertcc@tw.ibm.com>)
* siimage: PIO1/2 taskfile transfer overclocking fix
* pdc202xx_old: fix PIO mode setup
* sl82c105: DMA support fixes
  (Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com>)
+ some patches got fixed according to the feedback from Sergei
Also the order of the patches in the series file was changed to be more
like this: fixes first, then new drivers/features and cleanups at the end.
diffstat:
 62 files changed, 3349 insertions(+), 2496 deletions(-)
If you would like to see the full quilt series (or to get combined patch)
against 2.6.20-rc7, they are available here:
