That approach also won't be reliable as it ignores the realtime
constraint that is inherent in audio playback.  It will probably work on
a fast/lightly loaded machine but will glitch out under load.
It's how GDM plays startup/shutdown sounds and it sucks - on shutdown
the sound is choppy.  You either need a dedicated daemon running
SCHED_FIFO or an RT thread for reliable audio playback.
