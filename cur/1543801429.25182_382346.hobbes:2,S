Do you really expect your problems to be solved with that attitude?
If you want problems in Linux/ALSA/Open Source software in general,
you need to *SEND USEFUL BUGREPORTS AND WORK WITH THE DEVELOPERS TO
GET IT FIXED*
Replies like the one you just send gets you absolutely nowhere, or
even worse it may land whatever problem you are experiencing at the
bottom of the developers TODO list unless other people (that can be
worked with) also have the same problem.
You just demonstrated a very efficient way to *NOT* get your problem fixed.
