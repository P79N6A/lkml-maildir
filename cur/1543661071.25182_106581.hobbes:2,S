We have few HP (LPR NetServers and LT6000) which run 2.4.18  (from RedHat 8.0) 
. The problem is that sometimes the time interrupts stop coming - i.e. the 
(time) counts in /proc/interrupts stop getting incremented! When this 
happens, the date on the system falls behind, 'sleep' calls stop working and 
basically machine becomes unusable.Has anyone else encountered this problem? 
Is it an HP issue?
Thanks.
