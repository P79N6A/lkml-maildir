I did provide numbers for UDP latency, which is more critical for my own 
application since most messages fit within a single packet.  I haven't 
done UDP bandwidth testing--I need to check how lmbench did it for the 
unix socket and do the same for UDP.  Local TCP was far slower than unix 
sockets though.

Yes, I realize that the receiver still has to do a copy.  With large 
messages this could be an issue.  With small messages, I had assumed 
that the cost of a recv() wouldn't be that much worse than the cost of 
the sender doing a kill() to alert the receiver that a message is 
waiting.  Maybe I was wrong.
It might be interesting to try a combination of sysV msg queue and 
signals to see how it stacks up.  Project for tonight.
