As with many things in life, you can choose to behave well or poorly and
the people you help or hurt will act according.
The slashdot kiddies, as an example, seemed to think it was OK to swap all
the music they wanted for free.  The music industry responded by helping
push through the recent round of draconian laws which are much deplored on
slashdot and here for that matter.  
But nobody seems willing to stand up and say "well, maybe if we hadn't been
stealing all this music these laws might not have come into existence".
I'll leave you to make the BitKeeper connection, I'm sure you are smart
enough to do so.
