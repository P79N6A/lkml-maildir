hi,
I've been trying to get a CompactFlash act as an IDE-drive, 2nd or 3rd
ide-channel, that is, IDE1 or IDE2 resp. Didn't work. Seems to be driver
related.
I downloaded 2.4.18 and pcmcia-3.1.31, from the later I got "ide_cs.o"
The hardware I am using a a two socket PCI to PCMCIA bridge:
hale-bopp:~ # cat /proc/interrupts
[...]
 10:          1          XT-PIC  Texas Instruments PCI1221, Texas Instruments PCI1221 (#2)
when the init-script starts the pcmcia modules + cardmgr, the following
messages will appear in the kernel-log:
   : Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22
   :   options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]

"unable to get IRQ 10" is somewhat funny, since IRQ-10 is used by
the cardbus device. what I don't understand is if the IDE-drive
sould get its own interrupt or not.
"ports already in use" doesnt go away even when I remove all IDE-drives
(one CDROM, that is ;-) from ide1 and try to have the CompactFlash as
2ndry IDE (the message would then read: ide1: ports alread yin use,
skipping probe).
and finally an ugly detail: when removing the ComapctFlash and
unloading pcmcia, ide_cs will still have the ioport-ressources
clailed form /proc/ioport. seems there's a call to *_unregister
missing.
