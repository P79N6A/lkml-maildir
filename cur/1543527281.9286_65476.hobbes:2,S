Not necessarily, if this behaviour is defined.  It is no more broken
than the fact that write() can overwrite another process's data, or
truncate() can invalidate another process's mapping.  This is an
explicitly destructive system call and the user must have write access
to the file.
The discarding of modifications is obviously correct if the mapping is
MAP_PRIVATE, but I'd be interested in seeing what other Unixen actually
do on MAP_SHARED maps.  Similarly,
   msync(MS_INVALIDATE)
is expected to discard modifications by some applications (and I've
personally had requests for this funcationality from vendors whose
applications use it on shared memory segments).  Its definition in DU
includes:
  After a successful call to the msync() function with the flags parameter
  set to MS_INVALIDATE, all previous modifications to the file using the
  write() function are visible to the mapped region.  Previous direct
  modifications to the mapped region might be lost.
Again it isn't explicit whether this applies only to MAP_PRIVATE or to
MAP_SHARED too.
