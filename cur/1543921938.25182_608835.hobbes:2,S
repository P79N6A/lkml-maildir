Hi,
Thanks for debugging & fixing this.

Well, I do.  However due to hardware diversity it is not practically
possible to test them all myself...

Yeah, sorry for that.  ->host flags were expanded in struct ide_pci_device_s
(now struct ide_port_info) but not in struct hwif_s.  This went unnoticed
because majority of new flags are used only through struct ide_pci_device_s.
The exceptions are:
- IDE_HFLAG_NO_LBA48 (only user is trm290, exotic hardware)
- IDE_HFLAG_NO_LBA48_DMA (only user is alim15x3, revisions <= 0xC4)
- IDE_HFLAG_ERROR_STOPS_FIFO (the error path of pdc202xx_{old,new}) 
What worries me a bit is that commit 238e4f142c33bb34440cc64029dde7b9fbc4e65f
was in -mm since 2.6.23-rc4-mm1 (released on Sep 1 2007) and nobody reported
the issue earlier...
