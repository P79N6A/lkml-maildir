This may sound nuts, and maybe I missed it earlier, but isn't it possible
that, if this card will operate with the standard EEPRO100 driver for
windows, that the only reason it doesn't work with the Linux driver is the
that it is failing to detect it during the PCI probing?
A quick glance at the driver finds this code:
if (pcibios_find_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL,
PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82557,
                                                    pci_index, &pci_bus,
                                                    &pci_device_fn))
Another glance at pci.h and you find:
#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82557       0x1229
According to the first post the Device ID for this card is 5201.  Since 5201
<> 1229 the card would never be detected by the eepro100.c driver and thus
it would never work.
A quick test to see if this helps would be to modify the code as follows:
if (pcibios_find_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL,
                                                    0x5201,
                                                    pci_index, &pci_bus,
                                                    &pci_device_fn))
Recompile and this should force the driver to detect the EtherExpress
PRO/100 Server Adapter (of course it would no longer detect the standard
EEPRO100 cards, but it is just a test).
I think this is worth trying, as everything I read about the card indicates
that it should work with the standard EEPRO100 drivers.
Later,
Tom
