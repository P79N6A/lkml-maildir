Hi,
I had a couple of questions which I'm hoping someone would be kind
enough to explain :)

I wonder how this is different to all the other code which calls
lazy_mmu_prot_update() after set_pte_at(). do_swap_page, for example,
_could_ fault in executable code, couldn't it?
It is because do_swap_page uses flush_icache_page()? So why doesn't
the flush_icache_page() work in do_no_page as well? (It seems to look
like a superset of lazy_mmu_prot_update on ia64?!?).
And while we're looking at flush_icache_page, why is there none in
do_wp_page (I admit, I'm not really up to scratch on d/i cache aliasing
handling, but cachetlb.txt seems to suggest that cow_user_page fits the
description). That is, if we're already trying to cover our butts wrt
SMC, then do_wp_page _could_ be cow'ing executable code, couldn't it?
And for that matter, I admit I don't understand how the icache flushing
can be done lazily, only at change-protection time. Why is any
flush_dcache_page() site not a problem for an _existing_ executable pte
wrt d/i cache aliases?
BTW. while I'm ranting, I hope all this stuff has gone so complex for a
reason, and that being that the alternative simpler approach of more
flushes, less lazy, less complex, less buggy was tested and found to be
noticably slower... :)
