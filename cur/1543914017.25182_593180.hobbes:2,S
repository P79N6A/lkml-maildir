cfs = completely fair scheduler :)
In this thread, we are talking of hooking the cfs cpu scheduler with the
task-container framework in -mm tree, so that the scheduler can deal
with groups of tasks rather than just tasks, while handling fairness of
cpu allocation.
I agree "cfs" control subsystem does look odd a bit here. "cpu" control
subsystem seems better.
