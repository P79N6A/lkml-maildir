Hi Dave.

To be accurate, comments you can't answer without appearing stupider
than you already do were snipped.

Doesn't work...programjs like getty don't run until AFTER the kernel
finishes its initialisation...
 > #2 /dev/nvram?  userlandable
Agreed...but I said as much previously...

Doesn't work...too much overhead involved...

No idea - I've never tried it...but then, you clearly haven't tried
any of your suggestions either...

(1) and (3) NEED to be in the kernel to work at all...

Show me some use for the facilities you suggest that can't be achieved
better by a purely userland program then?
OTOH don't strain that single gray cell of yours too hard - you've
been challenged to do this at least six times so far by various
people, and haven't managed it yet, so I for one seriously doubt you
will achieve it...
Best wishes from Riley.
