The frame buffer device subsystem has been in active use on non-ia32
architectures for several years. Thus it's more or less stable ;-)
The `development' refers more to the individual drivers that can be used on
ia32: most of them are relatively new. Drivers that are used on other
architectures too, especially the m68k ones, are older and more stable.
