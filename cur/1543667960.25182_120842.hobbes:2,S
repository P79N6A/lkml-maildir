The cursor line on radeonfb now is solid, instead of the broken line
in 2.5.66.  It is still impossible to set the resolution.
The lilo approach:
append="video=radeonfb:1280x1024-24@60"
This seems to do nothing.  I get the same low resolution as
plain 2.5.66, which looks bad as it don't match the flat screen resolution.
The stty approach:
stty rows 64 cols 160 gives me an odd error message about
stdin being wrong.  Forcing it with -F /dev/tty
gives me lots of random colored text on the screen and the
scrolling is wrong afterwards.  Resolution don't change though.
I run devfs if that matters.
stty rows 25 cols 80 brought things back to normal, or so it seemed.
I switched back to X and noticed that most programs except ls
wouldn't run, they all segfaulted.  Something was wrong, and
a shutdown ended in a BUG in slab.c line 1557 and a hang.
A new thing with this patch is that I get a lot of junk displayed
to the side of the boot penguin. (Random colored letters).
  The junk disappear after a little while though.
