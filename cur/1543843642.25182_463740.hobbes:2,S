This is simply not true, at the source level you can remove a static 
tracepoint as easily as a dynamic tracepoint, the effect of the missing 
trace information is the same either way.

What makes the requirements so different? I would actually think it 
depends on the user independent of the tracing is done.

Anyone using static tracing intents to use, which makes this point moot.

Considering the level of work needed to support efficient dynamic tracing 
it only withholds archs from tracing support for no good reason.

It's sarcastic, but considering the disrespect towards Karim, I don't 
blame him. At some point the "whining" argument was funny, but lately it's 
only used to descredit people.
