Well, Live patching is just a patch, so I think the developer of patch
should know the original source code well.

Well, as you said some application can do that, but some application can
not continue service with your suggestion.
please think about the process which use connection type communication
such as TCP(it's only example) between users and server. During status
copy, all the session between users and server are disconnected... can
not save the exiting service at all.
It's one example, but similar problems may occurs whenever processed use
the resources which are mainly controlled by kernel.
