I got the following errors on my system yesterday:

The disk in question is a Seagate Cheetah U2W hooked up to an Adaptec
2940U2W. The system is 2.2.9 plus raid0145-19990421 plus
DAC960-2.2.0-production, compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3 under RedHat 5.2.
Hardware is Dual PII 450mhz (from VAResearch) with 1GB ram.  The partition
in question is /dev/sdb2, which is NOT associated with a RAID device,
although /dev/sdb1 is...
The partition contains on ext2 fs that checks out with no errors.
The software accessing the fs is Oracle8, trying to access one of the
tablespace files, which resulted in this Oracle8 error:
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-01115: IO error reading block from file 26 (block # 49352)
ORA-01110: data file 26: '/d02/oradata/dev/pw_tables3.dbf'
ORA-27072: skgfdisp: I/O error
Linux Error: 9: Bad file descriptor
Additional information: 49332
I can read the file correctly with cp or dd.
The system is still running under a moderate load, and has been up 20 days
with no real problems.
