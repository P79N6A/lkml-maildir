What is so suspicious about it? Two CPUs can do the job faster than a
single one. Thats the way it should be and the point of these
patches is to reduce locking so that this can happen in a more efficient
way.
There are some variances in these tests especially if one uses low memory
settings such as 1GB 2GB and to some extend also at 4GB. 16 GB gives quite
stable results but the machine I had available for this only had 8 GB. See
my earlier posts on the subject for other test results.
