True enough.  That does explain a lot.  But what about the Alpha?  From
reading gcc source awhile back I seem to remember that most if not all
parameters are passed in registers.  How does *that* work with varargs
and no prototypes?  Or does it?

Ah, but kernel-side?  My point was that if gcc (and binutils) is
flexible enough to let you pick an ABI at runtime, perhaps a RISCoid
ABI for x86 could coexist with the SysV one, to be used initially for
self-contained code like the kernel.  (And later, a possible transition
in userspace.)
