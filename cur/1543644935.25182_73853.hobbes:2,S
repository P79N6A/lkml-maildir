It'd actually be a "device state", not a "driver state" ...
And I suspect that the specific usbfs issue got fixed by that patch
to make its disconnect() method actually do its job, earlier this
year.  If there's an open issue, I'd likely characterize it as needing
to trust device drivers to disconnect() correctly ... without having
good ways to verify (later on) they really did so.  Unfortunately
that's an area where we know drivers like to make mistakes.

I think it _could_ be fine to do such rmmods, if all the module
remove races were removed ... and (for this issue) if the primitve
were actually "remove if the driver is not (a) in active use, or
(b) bound to any device".  Today we have races and (a) ... but it's
the lack of (b) that prevents hotplug from even trying to rmmod,
on the optimistic assumption there are no races.
