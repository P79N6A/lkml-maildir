Yes, and the thing you snipped from it was that it's inside a #ifdef.
Now, that #ifdef will be on for the __KERNEL__, but somebody else might
have compiled with some -traditional switch or other that disabled
"uint8_t" or just screwed it up some other way.

I think the point Viro is making is that uint8_t actually exists on things 
like old cray's too, even if end sup being a 64-bit entity.
I don't think that is correct, though. I think that comes from another
(proposed but not implemented) C language extension that would have
allowed something like that, namely the
	int X:17;
syntax, where X would be guaranteed to be "17 bits or more". I don't 
remember.
