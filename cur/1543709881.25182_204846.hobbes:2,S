Yeah, but do keep in mind that "something like" comment. I'm by no means 
sure that I remembered the exact reason correctly, and maybe they aren't 
really needed.
Also, I'm not convinced this isn't a gcc regression. It would be stupid to 
"fix" something that makes old gcc's complain, when they may be doing the 
right thing.
All that code was from early 2002 (around 2.4.9), so maybe somebody can 
find the full discussion on the linux-kernel archives from January 2002 or 
so?
