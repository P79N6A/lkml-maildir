This appears to be what was going on.  I put in a check for non-sector
aligned memory writes where I was calling the code I posted, and I found
a spot where I was passing 128 byte aligned memory (NetWare directory
records are 128 bytes long).  I changed this to always pass directory
LRU blocks on 512 bytes boundries, and the problem went away.  Seems
very specific to IDE.  SCSI did not seem to have this problem.
