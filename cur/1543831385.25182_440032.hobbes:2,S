Your first issue there is the XFS dir2 regression discussed recently
here and on xfs@oss.sgi.com - there's a patch available for that and
it's likely to be included in the next -stable release.

The initial problem (above) and three-of-four of your photos look
unrelated to XFS, but that first image is indicating a (now fixed)
XFS problem - so, looks like you have multiple issues there.
