UNIX sockets do not necessarily have a path in the filesystem. In fact, 
every socket object you see in the filesystem gets mapped to an object 
within sockfs (which you can't mount). You recognize it as "[socket:147829]"
when looking in /proc/11249/fd/. You will never see /dev/log within
/proc/XX/fd.
You can look at the source of the `lsof` utility which does some socket 
resolution.
lsof:
syslog-ng 3656 root       3u  unix 0xdf70f5e0              6404 /dev/log
gconfd-2 11249 jengelh   14u  unix 0xd4e4f1e0            147829 socket
