sometimes such "spurious" exports still make sense. Most of the time
they don't, and during these cleanups we've found several functions for
which the only "user" was the export, eg entirely dead code. 
Also nobody in the entire tree using a part of the API is a pretty good
sign that the API isn't good or even supposed to be used. (again,
exceptions possible, which is why cleaning this stuff is manual work and
not a script to just nuke it all)
