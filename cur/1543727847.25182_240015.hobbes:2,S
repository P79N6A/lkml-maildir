Alan, stop putting words into my mouth. I'm not saying it's a feature.

In essence, yes. I'm arguing that it's not easily doable to
differentiate between destructive and non-destructive commands. And that
doing so requires extensive tables because commands are not the same
across devices.
I'm not saying that I think it's a good thing! Or a feature, for that
matter. I'm just arguing the feasibility of doing it, the maintenance
involved, etc.

I'm well aware of the implications. The argument is only whether it's ok
to policy filter unknown commands. I guess with capability elevating the
app until the kernels are modified it would be ok, at least it enables
the apps to work for root.
