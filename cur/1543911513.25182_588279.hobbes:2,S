It's another waste of space in my inbox due to poorly-implemented
software.
If their mailman installation uses a whitelist, so I get *one* message
per list rather than a bounce for every message I send, then that's
somewhat acceptable.  If I get mailbombed just for participating in a
thread on lkml, that's definitely not acceptable (and I will remove such
lists from the Cc).
It would be vastly better if mailman were smart enough to autoapprove
threaded replies -- it's not as if the spammers are any more likely to
forge In-Reply-To: than From: (which they already do).  Or even to not
waste my time by sending a "held for moderation" message until it's
processed by the listowner.

Not sure what ad hominem attacks have to do with this situation.  It's
not as if I can reasonably /dev/null all mailman gunk; if there's a real
exception condition, I want to see it.
