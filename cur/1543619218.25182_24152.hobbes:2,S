Luckily, apache on its own doesn't seem to use lseek() when sending the
file - it seems to be an open, mmap, write.  (apache 1.3.22)
However, php with apache does do an lseek on the target script.  Now
remember the /. effect...  You'll be accessing the same file from
several apache or php processes.
