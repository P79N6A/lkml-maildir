/me agrees violently
btw., when i played with this tunable under -rt:
 enum {
         NV_OPTIMIZATION_MODE_THROUGHPUT,
         NV_OPTIMIZATION_MODE_CPU
 };
 static int optimization_mode = NV_OPTIMIZATION_MODE_THROUGHPUT;
the MODE_CPU one gave (much) _higher_ bandwidth. The queueing model in 
forcedeth seemed to be not that robust and i think a single queueing 
model should be adopted instead of this tunable. (which i think just hid 
some bug/dependency) But i never got to the bottom of it so it's just 
the impression i got.
