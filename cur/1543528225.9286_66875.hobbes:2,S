There exists no such option under Linux. The design is for 1 socket
per mount. What you're probably seeing is rather congestion of the
existing socket. This can have one of 3 causes:
Either:
   - Server is getting congested, and is replying too slowly to
     requests. In this case a 'tcpdump' will show large delays between
     the client sending out a request, and the server replying to it.
or
   - Actual network is congested, and you are running out of socket
     buffer space. You'll probably need to wait for linux-2.4 before a
     general fix is available (it has already been included in
     linux-2.3.x).
or
   - The RPC congestion avoidance algorithm is messing up. Try
     fiddling with increasing the 'timeo', and 'retrans' NFS mount
     option values.
Cheers,
