Subject: [PATCH 000 of 6] md: various fixes for md
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following are 6 patches for md which are suitable for 2.6.25-rc1.
The first fixes a bug which could make it a candidate for 24-final.
However it is a deadlock that seems to occur very rarely, and has been
in mainline since 2.6.22.  So letting it into one more release
shouldn't be a big problem.  While the fix is fairly simple, it could
have some unexpected consequences, so I'd rather go for the next cycle.
The second patch fixes a bug which only affect -mm at the moment but
will probably affect 2.6.25 unless fixed.
The rest are cleanups with no functional change (I hope).
Thanks,
NeilBrown
