Tom, I can't believe you are running that ancient version of BK, why it is
already 4 days old!  Try and stay current :-)
There is a 2.1.4b release that has clone -l in it, along with some rollup
fixes/enhancements for Linus.
There is an undocumented version of clone -l in your release which works like
	bk lclone from to
and does the hardlinks.
