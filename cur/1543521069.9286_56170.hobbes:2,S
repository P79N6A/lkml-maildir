As I mentioned, owning an interrupt spinlock and doing an ipi is currently
bound to deadlock. 
That does not mean we should cramp smp_call_function() and make it not
callable from an intr context though. I can't imagine why, but in theory
it should be possible to do smp_call_function() from inside an intr context
without holding an interrupt spinlock. 
Of course, if two cpus are doing this to each other, this will again 
deadlock, that is why I also mentioned that there needs to be percpu 
bitmasks that each cpu will check inside of smp_call_function() (as 
is done with smp_invalidate_needed).
