When I copiled the src fedora core 4 kernel 
(kernel-2.6.12-1.1456_FC4.src.rpm and kernel-2.6.13-1.1526_FC4.src.rpm), 
I got the same error messages.

I'm not using lvm or raid in the /root or the /boot partition. All 
partitions was made directly in the disk and formated with ext3 file 
system. I think all needed options was compiled in the new kernel, since 
I copied the /boot/config-2.6.12-1.1456_FC4 (config file from the kernel 
that works fine) and compiled the kernel.src.rpm without any 
modifications in the config file, and it still not working.
Any more ideas?
Thank you Alan.
