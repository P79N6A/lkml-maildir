Add a salvagable file system to ext4, i.e. when a file is deleted, you 
just rename it and move it to a directory called DELETED.SAV and recycle 
the files as people allocate new ones.  Easy to do (internal "mv" of 
file to another directory) and modification of the allocation bitmaps.  
Very simple and will pay off big.  If you need help designing it, just 
ask me.
