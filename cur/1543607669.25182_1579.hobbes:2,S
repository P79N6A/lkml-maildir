Nope. The HPT366 is a bog standard DMA IDE controller. At least unless Andre
can point out something I've forgotten any behaviour seen on it should be
the same as seen on any other IDE controller with DMA support.
In practical terms that should mean you can obsere the same HPT366 problem
he does on whatever random IDE controller is on your desktop box

When you are dealing with the VM limit which the limiter was originally
added for then it makes a lot of sense. When you want to use it solely for
other purposes then it doesnt.
