I think that this is needed: Bonwick's slab algorithm (i.e. two-level 
linked lists, implemented in cache_alloc_refill and  free_block) is 
intended for unfreeable objects.
The dentry cache is a cache of freeable objects - a different algorithm 
would be more efficient for shrinking the dentry cache after an updatedb.
I had started prototyping, but didn't get far.
