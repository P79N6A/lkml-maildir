Errata for which there is an SBIOS workaround are generally only
released to BIOS vendors and under NDA.  If Linux users were impacted by
such a bug we would most likely release a patch, but a much more likely
scenario is that it slips through the cracks because it's not a
configuration we would test in our QA.  So a small minority of users
that are running AHCI in class code 0101 would get some very rare but
serious errors that would be impossible to debug.

I don't have any say over that, but it's probably unlikely to be fixed.
Going forward we're only using open standards for storage.
