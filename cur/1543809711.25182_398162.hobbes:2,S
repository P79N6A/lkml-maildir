nothing wrong with that, only a lot of work ;-)

 * it automatically links all structures / function calls in the text
   to their detailed description.
 * it can put descriptive, structured text on one page with
   code documentation.
 * section hierarchy can be defined in the source files by assigning
   documentation blocks to "groups".
 * It's already there.
Most of these things won't be too hard to implement, but nethertheless
it will take some time.  I really don't want to reinvent the wheel.
Well, I'm not really fixed on doxygen, I just wanted to experiment
with other documentation systems to see what they can provide.
If someone can recommend a good one - fine.
If we write it ourself - fine, too.
But I don't want to start extending kernel-doc before taking a look
on alternatives.
