The build problen with Athlon+SMP was solved by AA's patch. I had tested a
similar patch on UP over 2.4.0-test and previous 2.4 releases with nary a
problem.
This may be too experimental for your purposes, but FWIW I'm writing from a
2.4.4-pre3 built with gcc-2.97-20010205 using -march=athlon set by the k7
config. I've been building kernels with that snapshot since the middle of
Feb. With the current image, the box has locked up once in continuous use. I
can't say what caused that one, no log survived. 
Cheers,
Tom
