AFAIK the only difference is that Xen uses a table of them to pass
the hypervisor and normal Linux calls the macros directly, right?
I would suggest you just use the table for normal Linux too
and make the function that processes them natively !CONFIG_XEN
I guess it will make the code smaller for the normal case and people happy.
That would be much cleaner than just separating it out.
