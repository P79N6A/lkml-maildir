I think wpa_supplicant takes the right approach (i.e. putting the majority of 
the code in user space).  The supplicant is not performance intensive and 
there's little justification for it going in the kernel on other grounds 
(like security).  I've had madwifi working with wpa_supplicant for quite a 
while and have also done a rough port of wpa_supplicant to the bsd world too 
so it's design is proven (and in general I think it's excellent work).
I'd second Jouni's comments about moving the wireless extensions support 
forward.  Aside from WPA there are a few private mechanisms required for 
multi-mode devices that should be handled through a standard API.
