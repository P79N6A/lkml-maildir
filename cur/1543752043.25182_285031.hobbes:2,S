Currently there are four things in the -ac tree that use this feature
1.	ISA PnP, where we don't support hotplug (and anyway the only maker of
consumer hotpluggable ISA docking stations I know of - IBM - wont
provide docs on them)
2.	ide-cs
3.	delkin (cardbus IDE)
4.	PCI layer
Of those the PCI one is a common shared function so I put the supporting
logic in the IDE PCI helper function, The others need different handling
at the PCMCIA or Cardbus level in order to free up resources and clean
up.
