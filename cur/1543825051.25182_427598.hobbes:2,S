Well, git-stripspace actually does something slightly differently, in that 
it also removes extraneous all-whitespace lines from the beginning, the 
end, and the middle (in the middle, the rule is: two or more empty lines 
are collapsed into one).
Ie it's a total hack for parsing just commit messages (and it is in C, 
because I can personally write 25 lines of C in about a millionth of the 
time I can write 3 lines of perl).
