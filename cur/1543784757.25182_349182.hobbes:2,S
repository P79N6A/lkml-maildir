I'll admit I don't keep track of the distros and what kernels and features 
they are useing. I think I've heard people mention gentoo, but I 
haven't verified this.
however with the thousands of linux distros out there I'd lay odds that 
_someone_ is doing it ;-)
That said, my comments about the schedule should apply to any significant 
feature, not just devfs, it just happens to be the current patch being 
discussed. If Greg hadn't asked me how long I thought he needed to wait I 
would have dropped out after my initial post, but he asked so I answered.
