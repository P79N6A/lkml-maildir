Ok, how about this function.  If it errors out, it is free to just call
kfree() on the kobject.  Seems simple enough to me, any objections?  If
not, I'll go through and fix up the whole tree...

/**
 * kobject_init - initialize a kobject structure
 * @kobj: pointer to the kobject to initialize
 * @ktype: pointer to the ktype for this kobject.
 * @fmt: the name of the kobject
 *
 * This function will properly initialize a kobject such that it can then
 * be passed to the kobject_add() call.
 *
 * If the function returns an error, the memory allocated by the kobject
 * can be safely freed, no other functions need to be called.
