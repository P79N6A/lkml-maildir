a) vxfs isn't free.
b) vxfs may not be available on the platform required by the application.
c) If you've already *got* platform A that doesn't have vxfs, you will probably
think *really* hard about migrating - there's the costs of buying the hardware,
software, and liveware....

And often, a lot of inefficiency is overlooked. The cost of buying a new server
from another vendor, buying new licenses for all the software, installing it
all, arranging maintenance contracts, getting sysadmins with a clue regarding
the new system, and all the rest of the costs of a conversion can *easily*
outweigh any "less efficient" ways.
