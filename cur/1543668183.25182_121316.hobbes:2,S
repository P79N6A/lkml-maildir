I have an oldie 400GX. Just 'Enabled ACPI register' in the BIOS. But I did not
rebuilt the kernel to use ACPI. Anyways, I just got the patch for 3c59x from
-ac, and applied on mine, to upgrade to 1.1.18. Tests follow....
The 905C-TX does not work. I have tried with a couple more cards, a 905B and
a 980-TX. Both work (one older and one newer):

What is wrong now is the description given by the 1.1.18 version (I can swear
I only have one hole to plug the cable ;)). I will lookup the IDs in the
driver and lspci lists and compare....
So, 3 options:
- the 905C goes to trashcan
- the driver fails to initialize something (I dont trust this...)
- winblows messed the card eeprom...any way to tidy it up again ?
Thanks everybody...
