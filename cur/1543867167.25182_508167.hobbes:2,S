No, it is a classical P4 machine, ASUS P4C800E-Deluxe motherboard. However, it might
have been related to the overclocked CPU. Although 12 other, exactly same machines are running
fine at the same over-clock I have decreased the settings. It did not happen since then.
So I believe it was a hardware issue. Thanks for the explanation.
