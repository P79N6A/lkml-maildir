You don't turn them off - you just don't run them. What I'm
suggesting is not a separate system that runs a stripped-down
Linux kernel, but rather a device that looks like another
node in a NUMA system.
There might be a point in completely excluding subsystems
that will never be used on that NIC anyway, but that's already
an optimization.
