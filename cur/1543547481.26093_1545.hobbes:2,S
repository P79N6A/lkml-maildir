The 3c905, 3c905B, 3c905C and all 3Com Cardbus NICs will do
scatter and gather of up to 63 fragments per packet with
byte-granular fragment alignment and length.
All of them except the 3c905 provide hardware Rx and Tx
checksumming of IP, TCP and UDP headers.  No 64 bit
addressing support.
Is this sufficient?
