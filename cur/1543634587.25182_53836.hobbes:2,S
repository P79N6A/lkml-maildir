Oh, no!
What's going on with the kernel community? I posted a similar fix for 
the 2.4.18 kernel, and it hasn't been picked up there either.
For the 2.4.18 kernel scheduler, our 86 process application (SCHED_FIFO, 
priorities 7-23, System V semaphores for priority preemption) won't even 
stay up without my patch.
The 2.2.21 SCHED_FIFO behaviour is correct but slightly inefficient, 
while the SCHED_RR behaviour is plain broken. What is an application 
that depends on correct SCHED_RR behaviour to do in that case? There are 
applications where increased latencies as a result of SCHED_RR being 
broken are unacceptable.
