IMO, calling the architecture's do_signal function to handle that is
entirely the wrong way to go.  They don't even all have the same
arguments, and the wrappers hi-res-timers put around sys_nanosleep are
hideous.
All of this should be handled correctly in kernel/signal.c, and things
like triggering the debugger should be done from there, not duplicated
in each platform's signal delivery code.
Ideally we should even trigger the debugger without necessarily
knocking the sleeping process out of sleep.
