Hi...
The rivafb and the nvidia-accelerated drivers conflict, yes, but you can own situation if you tell X to use the rivafb-framebuffer instead the nvidia-one.
Section "Device"
        Identifier      "GeForce"
        Driver          "nvidia"
        BusID           "1:0:0"
        Option          "UseFBDev"      "true"
EndSection
This should fix the problem.
And, I have my own question, too... How do I switch my resolution?
"kernel /boot/gentoo-2.4.20-r5-bo.nvidia root=/dev/hda3 video=rivafb:1280x1024-32@100" doesn't work for me.
What is wrong? 
Thanks a lot for solutions,
