Why? OSF/1's copyin/copyout returns exactly same value which
our current copy_{to,from}_user does. You should not penalize
developers who read documentation.

From copyin/out descriptions sent yesterday if you want same source code 
running on all (BSD,SVR4,OSF/1) platforms, you must do
if (copyin()) return [-]EFAULT;
anyway, otherwise OSF/1 and SVR4 variants are wrong.
