Hello,
I want to do a new "distro" (home-brew) in some weeks,
when kernel 2.4 runs fine with gcc-3.0 when it's
finished. I want to use libc5 because I prefer it
over GNU and it's smaller. Is it possible or do
I have to expect major problems? I know that I won't
be able to use IPv6 etc. but that's not important.
Last distro I had good experience with 2.0.38
and libc5.4.46.
And, are there ANY updates to 5.4.46 (security
and/or bugfix?)
TIA
