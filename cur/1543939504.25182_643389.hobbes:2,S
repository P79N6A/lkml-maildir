I just added it to clarify this code is now only used on m68knommu (Coldfire).
The comments on top are mailny about MPC860T CPUs (PowerPC), however the driver is no
longer used for these CPUs.
Maybe the wording should be changed to:
This driver is now only used on ColdFire (m68knommu) processors. Conditional
PowerPC code has been removed.
Thanks,
Jochen
