Beause firmware is a clearly separate part.
It's not a part of the kernel at all - it doesn't even run on the same 
CPU, for christ sake! Firmware if anything is _further_ removed from the 
kernel than user programs are.

Go back and read this same thread three or four months ago. You are 
barking up the wrong tree. There is a HUGE difference between a binary 
kernel module running inside the kernel, and a firmware image running on 
another CPU entirely behind a bridge. 
There's a huge conceptual separation, but there's also an actual 
_physical_ separation. How much different do you want things to be?
Firmware on a device is logically equivalent to the kernel running on
another machine entirely. A USB device firmware is from a logical (and
technical) standpoint not really any different than a fileserver running
on a different computer.
