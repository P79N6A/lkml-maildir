Your analysis of what is needed is correct.  However, we would prefer to 
fit this into the DMA API in a generic way, rather than having a 
specialized API that is not acceptable upstream.  I'm more concerned 
with finding the best way to address this problem than with whether this 
is a 2.6 or 2.7 issue.
We do need a memory allocator for the pool of SRAM.  If we're not going 
to have to build customized versions of the OHCI driver, we need that 
pool hooked into the dma_pool and dma_alloc_coherent interfaces.  We 
could do that with a platform specific implementation of 
dma_alloc_coherent, but a pointer to dma_{alloc,free} from struct device 
seems like a cleaner solution.  We also will need bounce buffers, as you 
described, but there is already a good start towards that support in 
2.6.  The other thing that might be needed is passing device to 
page_to_dma so that device specific dma addresses can be constructed.

I think I'm looking for something like the PARISC hppa_dma_ops but more 
generic:
