Subject: [PATCH 0/4] UML - Console cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/30/226

These patches resulting from noticing a lot of cleanups needed in the
UML console system while fixing the previous spurious interrupt
testing.
There is one minor bug fix - a misordering of the error cleanups in
one of the drivers.
These are for 2.6.24.
