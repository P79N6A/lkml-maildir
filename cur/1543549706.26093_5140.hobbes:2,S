Hi,
 I'm running Linux 2.2.17+ide.2.2.17.all.20000904.patch and
just saw these messages in my log files:
hda: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hda: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hda: DMA disabled
ide0: reset: success
What do the mean, do I have to worry about them?
The system had no big load, when it happened, it just had some
(5-10?) seconds without activity. Then, it seems to continue
working without problems.
My computer's configuration:
AMD K6 III CPU, 500 MHz; 128 MB core; it has an ALI chipset
("Ali M15x3 Chipset" according to /proc/ide/ali); i have only one
hard disk: IBM-DTTA-350840 (/proc/ide/hda/model).
I need the IDE patch, for UDMA support for this chipset 
Are there any more useful information, I can give?
	moritz
