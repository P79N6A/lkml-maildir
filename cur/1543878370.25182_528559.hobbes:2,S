Argh! Now after intensive use over the last 2 days, I realized that the
internal harddisk works OK, but the dvd-drive did not after the 7th
suspend/resume cycle - the device was suddenly gone (I could not even
eject the disc I just inserted), more verbose dmesg follows:
ata1: port is slow to respond, please be patient (Status 0x80)
ata1: port failed to respond (30 secs, Status 0x80)
