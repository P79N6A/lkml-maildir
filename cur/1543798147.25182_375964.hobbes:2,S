This is not a problem.  We ask for GPL source code, not
the fancy printed copyrighted pdf.  Sure it'd be nice to have,
maintenance is harder without it, but the driver itself
should not cause copright problems with a standards
document. This because a copy of the document isn't
included in the driver source.

Sure - if I want the standard document. No need if all I want is the
driver that was written with the aid of said standard document,
assuming the driver writer didn't include large passages from
the document in the comments.
Something like:
/* Implementation of the xyz algorithm, see std.document for
    specification on how it is supposed to work. */
ought to be fine.
