No: for the pthread_create case you would pass the pointer to new struct
pthread tid in parent_tidptr, while for fork you would pass the
parameter of cfork as parent_tidptr and child_tidptr would be inherited.
However I don't think that this is a good interface, just a bit better
than having two flags and a single pointer.
