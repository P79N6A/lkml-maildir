[andersen@slag andersen]$ dpkg -l modutils strace  | tail -n2
ii  modutils       2.3.9-3        Linux module utilities.
ii  strace         4.2-4          A system call tracer.
I just downloaded the source to modutils-2.1.121, 
modutils-2.2.2-pre8, and modutils-2.3.9 and every 
one of them has:
    open("/proc/modules", O_RDONLY)
in insmod/lsmod.c along with the comment
    /* We've got no other option but to read /proc.  */
I don't know where you got your strace, but I suspect it is broken.  If it is
indeed working, I would dearly love to see the interface lsmod used to get the
kernel module information.
