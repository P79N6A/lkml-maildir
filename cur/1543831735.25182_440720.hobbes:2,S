true. I redid my tests with both lockdep and debug-spinlocks turned off:
  text            data    bss     dec             filename
  21172153        6077270 3081864 30331287        vmlinux.x32.after
  21198222        6077106 3081864 30357192        vmlinux.x32.before
with 851 callsites that's a 30.6 bytes win per call site (total 26K) - 
still not bad at all.
it's a win even on 64-bit:
  text            data    bss     dec             filename
  21237025        6997266 3327600 31561891        vmlinux.x64.after
  21252773        6997090 3327600 31577463        vmlinux.x64.before
with 755 callsites that's still a 20.8 bytes win per call site (total 
15K).

but three assignments could mean 3 offsets embedded in the instructions. 
(for init_waitqueue_entry we also embedd the address of 
default_wake_function) Even 3 assignments can add up to a footprint that 
is far from marginal.
The rough rule of thumb for inlining is that anything that is larger 
than one C statement is probably too large for inlining. (but even 
1-line statements might be too fat at times)
