The virtual block device driver in coLinux, named cobd, is synchronous 
with the host OS highest level read()/write() functions, which 
means e.g. for a READ block I/O request in the guest, 
filp->f_op->read() is called on an open 'struct file' in the host. 
If the call blocks, the entire guest VM blocks on it. 
So, according to this, any type of I/O in the guest means synchronous 
I/O in the host unless the data is already in the guest's buffer cache.
It's not really the implementation I am planning to stick to, but 
it sure was very easy to implement. 
BTW, the block device on the host side can be a file or any 
device that exposes read()/write() interfaces to userspace. In 
this benchmarking case it is a 3GB file that hosts an image of 
an ext3 filesystem.
