I have some embedded diskless devices that have 16 MB of RAM and >500MB of
swap. Its root fs and swap device are both done over NBD because NFS is too
expensive in 16MB of RAM. Any memory contention (i.e needing memory to swap
memory over the network), however infrequent, causes the system to freeze when
about 50 MB of VM is used up. I would love to see some work done in this area.
