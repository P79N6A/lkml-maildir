hm, i think you are right.

maybe 'struct timer' and 'struct hrtimer' is the right solution after 
all, and our latest queue doing 'struct timer_list' + 'struct hrtimer' 
is actually quite close to it.
'struct ptimer' does have a bit of vagueness in it at first sight, do 
you agree with that? (does it mean 'process'? 'posix'? 'precision'?) 
also, hrtimers on low-res clocks do have high internal resolution, but 
they are not precise timing mechanisms in the end, due to the low-res 
clock. So the more generic name would be 'high-resolution timers', not 
'precision timers'. (also, the name 'precision timers' sounds a bit 
funny too, but i dont really know why.)
