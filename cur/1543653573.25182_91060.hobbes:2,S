Subject: [BK PATCH] pcibios removal changes for 2.5.48
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here are a few changesets that removes almost all of the remaining usages
of pcibios_read_config* and pcibios_write_config* calls.  It also
removes them from pci.h and deletes drivers/pci/compat.c.
These changes have been in the -ac tree for a while, and I have been
running a lot of different types of machines with them for a number of
weeks (servers to laptops).
Please pull from:  bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/pci-2.5
There are still a small number of places in the tree where these
functions show up, but the usage falls into one of three categories:
 - compatibility code for older kernels.  This includes the following
   files:
	drivers/scsi/gdth.c
	drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx.c
	drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_comm.h
	drivers/scsi/tmscsim.c
	drivers/scsi/megaraid.c
	drivers/net/wan/sdladrv.c
	drivers/char/ip2main.c
	linux/compatmac.h
 - drivers that are outdated and do not build anyway:
	drivers/isdn/hisax/hfc_pci.c
	drivers/isdn/eicon/lincfg.c
	drivers/isdn/eicon/linio.c
 - arch specific code that I can not build, nor test.  A number of these
   instances contain code that directly touches hardware (the network
   driver is an example of that), or is doing other platform specific
   stuff that I do not know how to fix:
	drivers/video/S3triofb.c
	drivers/net/gt96100eth.c
	alpha/kernel/sys_nautilus.c
	alpha/kernel/sys_sio.c
I also think that a number of older pcibios functions can be removed
from m68knommu/kernel/comempci.c, but will have to ask the author of
that file first.
thanks,
greg k-h
