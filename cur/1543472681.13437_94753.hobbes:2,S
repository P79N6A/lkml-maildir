Differences with `Kernelver' field:
o	fixed a really very subtle console race that was causing a kernel
	lockup if a proggy was writting to the console at the same time the
	keyboard was pressed
o	irq_state array is cache aligned to decrease bus traffic under
	intense irq activities
o	tuned a bit the new VM freeing algorithm to improve VM performance
(o	fixed a bug in gettimeofday that was causing not monothonic
	increasing values, improved also some hot things) merged in 2.1.132-3
o	new IEEE1284 parport code from Tim Waugh with some fixes from me.
	It works fine here. It simplify radically the code of lp.c, the only
	not very cool thing is that it decrease the way the printer can be
	tuned via tunelp since IEEE1284 has its timings and its fixed way
	to work... It's very fun though, so try it an be happy ;)
o	get_wchan() moved in arch specific section and CTRL+SCROLL-LOCK
	use get_wchan() to get the PC filed information. Due this change
	the arca-56 kernel compile only on i386 and alpha (alpha is just
	uptodate too).
o	fixed page bound limits and the case of a new forked not
	scheduled yet process in get_wchan()
(o	fixed a little bug in a emergency SMP code in irq.c (Ingo and
	Linus)) merged in 2.1.132-3
o	some still pending (not yet merged from Alan) jiffies wrap update
o	reimplemented time to jiffies functions handling all kind
	of overflows, it fixes also a schedule_timeout() printk flood
	due to an overflow in timeout = (timeout*HZ+999)/1000+1; in poll()
o	removed unused flag from the mmstruct since we don't do aging
	anymore (we use the PG_referenced bitflag only)
o	new delayed ack heuristic invented by me to handle better
	performance on congestioned networks
o	little vmalloc fix
o	the kernel will boot in the past of one hour (see `uptime`), if in
	the first hour something screw up let me know because it means
	that you catched a probably trivially fixable jiffies wrap bug
o	some minor things
