Thanks for the reply! I'll buy one of your books!
2.6.16.28 SMP
The application is an "embedded", headless system and we've pretty much laid
memory out the way we want it, the only rogue player is the tar update
process. A little bit of swapping is fine but enough swapping to irritate
OOM is not desireable. Yes, the swap is only 500MB but this is a purpose
built system, there are no random user apps started and stopped so
absolutely nothing swaps until the update process runs.
Here's meminfo from an idle system, on a loaded system the machine locks up
now since I've disabled OOM trying to prevent the imminent crash. I got
desperate and not only set swappiness to zero but I've also tried setting
the dirty ratios down as low as 1, the centisecs as low as 1 and cache
pressure as high as 9999. I'm thrashing and running out of dials to turn.
With the ridiculous settings above dirty pages porpoise between 0-20K, with
more reasonable settings they porpoise between 10-40K but it seems to be the
inactive page count that is killing me.

Don't set swappiness to zero...   Leaving it at the default should avoid
the oom-killer.
