Okay, I'm back looking at this now.  In the interim, the box has undergone
a complete re-install, and I think the original boot logs are gone for good.
Now (with 2.6.28.1), the boot code identifies a quirk, and pci_enable_msi()
does indeed fail where it once succeeded.  So all is well, but I don't know
why it wasn't working correctly earlier.
Oh well.
Cheers
