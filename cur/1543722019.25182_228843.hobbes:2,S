Why in an abstract API would we care how the memory is connected to
the system? Isn't the only relevant issue whether the memory is in the
CPU's normal address space?

How is it relevant whether memory can be DMAed to by devices other
than the device in question? Even on regular x86 there's the low 16MB,
isn't there?

Then what's the problem?
