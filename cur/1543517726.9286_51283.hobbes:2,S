Years of solid unix experience, good design and non-braindamaged
implementation, would seem to be a useful start to our list of
"Enterprise"[1] features.
Real H/A needs some special hardware support (on any o/s), and we get
H/A for our linux servers by clustering them behind a cisco
LocalDirector.  This mean zero downtime even when we want to do
hardware upgrades etc.
I don't know what "servicability" is supposed to mean.

[1] Enterprise features normally mean an o/s that any "enterprising"
young script-kiddie can hack to ribbons.
