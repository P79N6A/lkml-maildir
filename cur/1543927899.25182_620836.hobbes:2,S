With millions of LOC the primary maintainers cannot review everything.
It's not that anybody is doing a bad job -- it is just so much code
that explicit mechanisms are better than implicit contracts.

No of course not -- it is just too much code to let everything
be reviewed by the core subsystem maintainers. But with explicit
marking of internal symbols they would need to look at it because
the relationship will be clearly spelled out in the code.

Out of tree solutions generally do not scale.  Nobody else can 
keep up with 2+ Million changes each merge window.

There are still classes of drivers. e.g. for the SCSI example: SD,SG,SR etc.
are more internal while low level drivers like aic7xxx are clearly external
drivers.

No, actually namespaces kind of help out of tree modules. Once they only
use interfaces that are really generic driver interfaces and fairly stable
their authors will have much less pain forward porting to newer kernel
version. But currently the authors cannot even know what is an instable
internal interface and what is a generic relatively stable driver level
interface. Namespaces are a mechanism to make this all explicit.
