this is cool to see.  Using a class-driver is very different from the 
vtable-approach
that I used (struct nsc_gpio_ops) in pc8736x_gpio and scx200_gpio.
Are any of the limitation youve cited above related to the 
/sys/class/gpio paths below ?
+	  To set pin 63 to low (to start the motor) do a:
+	   $ echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio63/level
+	  Or to stop the motor again:
+	   $ echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio63/level
+	  To get the level of the key (pin 8) do:
+	   $ cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio8/level
+	  The result will be 1 or 0.
+
+	  To add new GPIO pins at runtime (lets say pin 88 should be an input)
+	  you can do a:
+	   $ echo 88:in > /sys/class/gpio/map_gpio
+	  The same with a new GPIO pin 95, it should be an output and at high level:
+	   $ echo 95:out:hi > /sys/class/gpio/map_gpio
+
