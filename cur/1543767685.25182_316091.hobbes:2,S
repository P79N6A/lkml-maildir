Hi,
AOE is a bit new for me.
Would it be possible to use tha AOE driver to
attach one ATA drive in a host over ethernet to another
host ? Or is it support for specific hardware devices only?
You know, something like:
# fdisk <device_on_another_host>
# mkfs.ext2 <device_on_another_host/partition1>
# mount <device_on_another_host/partition1> /mnt/part1
