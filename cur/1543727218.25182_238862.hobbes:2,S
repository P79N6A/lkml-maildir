I've seen this same thing when S-ATA drives have really died on me while 
using 2.4.24-26+libata, computer just locks up even when used with md 
RAID1/RAID5. Though this is Intel ICH5("R"). Didn't have any time to get 
any more debugging done at those few times, though.
It's mostly just annoying to have to reset the machines, especially as 
this does not happen with the drivers/ide drivers (not verified with 
ich5 specificly).
