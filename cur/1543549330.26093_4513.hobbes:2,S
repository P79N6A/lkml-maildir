Yes and no.  I assume you refer to the ability to force link speed,
duplex, etc?  This is a broken way to fix broken hardware/software and I
wouldn't expect many drivers to implement this part.
But the ability to talk to the driver directly, to have a uniform
interface to query the link state, the link settings, to be able to tune
driver-specific settings, to fetch driver-specific performance data and
to dynamically change the driver debug level would be pretty useful.

Not at all, and I suspect that an attempt to define all this stuff
up-front will come unstuck.

Well, if the driver supports SIOCGMIIPHY then the userland support
library should be able to sort these things out.  As far as reporting on
interface settings, I'd view this proposal as allowing individual
drivers to fill in any gaps.  But the proposal goes further than this.
Anyway.  Jeff, this smells to me like 2.5-food.  This interface won't be
proven and stabilised until a couple of dissimilar drivers have actually
used it, and the userland stuff is implemented.
