What kernel it was?

You shouldn't be able to do that.

Not that I could promise clear and concise explanation, but let's try.
1. To create or delete links in directory foo you must have write *and*
execute permissions on foo.
2. You cannot create or delete links if foo is on a read-only filesystem
(surprise, surprise) or has Immutable attribute set.
3. You cannot delete links from the directory that has Append-only
attribute set. Moreover, you can't overwrite them (with rename()).
4. You cannot create or delete links *to* Append-only or Immutable
objects.
5. You cannot remove a mountpoint or root.
6. To delete a link from sticky directory you should either
	a) be owner of directory or
	b) be owner of object the link points to or
	c) have CAP_FOWNER capability.
7. There are two policies wrt to group of new objects: one is to use the
EGID of creating process and another - GID of the directory containing 
the first link. If directory is not SGID we always follow the first
policy (EGID of creating process). If mount options permit *and* directory
is SGID we use the second one (inherit GID from the parent directory). In
that case subdirectories are marked with SGID too. (It's old BSD vs
Missed'em'Five story).
That's all about the effect of permissions on directory operations. Oh,
yeah - to read the contents of directory you need read permissions, to
use links in it you need execute permissions (read without execute -> see
them but can't reach them, execute without read -> blind but able to
move).
