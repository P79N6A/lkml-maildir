No, the only problems are with the way the various pieces of your
drivers refer to devices by index.  There are obvious races such as

suppose number_of_devices gets set to 5 but by the time you call
ipath_verbs_register(5,...), the 5th device has been unplugged?
Also you only do this when the module is loaded, so you won't handle
devices that are hot-plugged later.  And I don't see anything that
would handle hot unplug either.
Pretty much any use of ipath_max is probably broken by hot plug.
