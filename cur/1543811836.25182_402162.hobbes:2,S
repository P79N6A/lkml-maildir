Subject: why VM_SHM has been removed from mm.h?

Hello all,
VM_SHM is used by DIPC to quickly recognise when we are dealing with a 
System V IPC segment. It has been "removed" from recent kernels (set to 0). 
Is there an easy way to find out if a segment is a Sys V shm? if not, I 
suggest we re-activate it.
