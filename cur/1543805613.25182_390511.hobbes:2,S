At some level non-mempool users are going to have to use the same functions
as mempool users.  As you can see in patch 9/9, all we really need is to
get the mempool_t pointer down to cache_grow() where the *actual* cache
growth happens.  Unfortunately, between the external callers (kmalloc(),
kmem_cache_alloc(), etc) and cache_grow() there are several functions.  I
will try to follow an approach similar to the patch you linked to above for
this patch (modifying the externally callable functions), but I don't think
the follow-on patch can change much.  The overhead of passing along a NULL
pointer should not be too onerous.

I decided that using a whole page allocator would be the easiest way to
cover the most common uses of slab/kmalloc, but your idea is very
interesting.  My immediate concern would be trying to determine, at kfree()
time, what was allocated by the slab allocator and what was allocated by
the critical pool.  I will give this approach more thought, as the idea of
completely separating the critical pool and slab allocator is attractive.
Thanks!
