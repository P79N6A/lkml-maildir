Thanks ... still hoping that the OMAP tree will just be able
to pull down the kernel.org version of this driver soon!!
OK, here's an updated patch 6/6 that merges Imre's update.
Dmitry, that makes six patches you should have ... I updated
the hwmon patch (#3), and now this one (#6); #4 and #5 will
thus apply with some offsets.
If you don't have other issues, I'd like to see these get into
the 2.6.20 release ... except for that version of the hwmon patch,
everything has been in use for some time through the OMAP tree,
which AFAICT is right now the main user of this driver.  (That'll
change a bit once Atmel's patches merge.)

Input: ads7846: detect pen up from GPIO state
We can't depend on the pressure value to determine when the pen was
lifted, so use the GPIO line state instead.  This also helps with
chips (like ads7843) that don't have pressure sensors.
