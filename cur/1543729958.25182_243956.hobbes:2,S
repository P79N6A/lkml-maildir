It is definetely impossible to use IPTables to handle packets with incorrect
checksums since NAT would drop the connection right away, otherwise I would
not have been asking this question here.

How about setting up a separate box which would listen on that 
192.168.77.1 address and MASQUERADE connections to your crazy box from 
192.168.1.x address? Maybe then you would no longer need to break things 
  in kernel?
