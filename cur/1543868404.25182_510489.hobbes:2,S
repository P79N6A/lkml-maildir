I've hacked up the sysrq code so that it gives me another command : j , 
which dumps the current IRQ status on the console :
SysRq : Show IRQ status
......
Showing info for IRQ 14
status         :
depth          : 0
wake_depth     : 0
irq_count      : 38717
irqs_unhandled : 0
Showing info for IRQ 15
status         : DISABLED
depth          : 1
wake_depth     : 0
irq_count      : 22
irqs_unhandled : 0
which is a the (incomplete) result on my machine after loading a module 
that does disable_irq(15) on module load.
I've put the patch at 
http://www.jdi-ict.nl/areca/sysrq-j.patch
I'll do a follow-up when anything usefull comes out.
Regards,
	Igmar
