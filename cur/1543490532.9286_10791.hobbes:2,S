I've been trying to get the ESS Maestro stuff to work on 2.2.3-ac3, and
although I can get the ess_pci module to load, /proc/sound reports:
"Audio devices: Sound Blaster (8 BIT/MONO ONLY) (3.2)"
Attempting any output to /dev/dsp produces no sound. ioport 0x220, irq 5
and dma 1 are allocated by the driver and /proc/interrupts shows irq5s
incrementing during dsp output. I have "options sb support=1 type=16" in
conf.modules - is this correct?
my card is a DMAN 2044, pci vendor id 1285,100.
does anyone have any suggestions? if more info is required I'm happy to supply
it but I didn't want to fill the list up with irrelevent stuff.
thanks in advance.
