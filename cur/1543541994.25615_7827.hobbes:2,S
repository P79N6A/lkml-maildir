The critical one on a PC is almost always memory bandwidth. Running a tight
loop on one CPU doing chained dereferences to the same cache colour  (ie
continually cycling lines through cache) will heavily dent performance of
the whole machine. You really do have to try hard to get x86 apps on heavily
smp scaled boxes running from cache
