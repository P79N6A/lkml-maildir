I tried the modification you suggested and it had little effect.  On a 4 cpu
(otherwise idle) system I saw the characteristic 30+ usec interruptions
(holdoffs) every 2 seconds.
Since it's running in timer context, this of course includes all of the
timer_interrupt logic, but I've verified no other timers running during those
times (and I see only very short holdoffs during other timer interrupts).
