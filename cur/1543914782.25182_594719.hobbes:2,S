Thanks for the comment. Yes, first would be massive overkill in this case 
and second somewhat annoying as one of the differences is support for 
different resources (IRQs) among the two versions, whereas I'm checking the 
validity of the passed in values at a time I do not know which version I'm 
looking at yet -- knowing that requires having talked to the hardware.
Can do, but for now it seems like the two seperate modules might be cleaner. 
Can keep things much more straighforward that way by just redefining a bunch 
of #defines.
I'll just do the split version first and if someone really wants me to, I'll 
merge them after all...
