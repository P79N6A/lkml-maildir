Yes. That would explain a lot. 
The ide-scsi thing never uses "cdrom_get_last_written" crud. It just uses
the regular READ_CAPACITY command (0x25).
Which is what ide-cd.c will fall back to as well ("cdrom_read_capacity()")
but I think it should _start_ with that rather than fall back on it.
That's the simple case, after all.
Does it work if you change the order of those two things in ide-cd.c (or
just remove the call to "cdrom_get_last_written()" entirely, so that it
always just does the sane thing).
