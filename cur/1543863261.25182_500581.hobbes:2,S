Very strong please no from me.  Please move it around to different
venues, if needed in north america again.  kernel summit shouldn't
be a marketing add-on but something on it's own.
While we're at it it would be nice to get rid of all that usenix
and sponsors that get a seat baggage aswell, especially as we've
proven that all small on-topic conferences without that overhead
are a lot more productive.
