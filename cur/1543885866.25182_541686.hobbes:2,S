Well. It makes code consistent and easier to create documentation even
for interfaces which are only used inside of one subsystem. We want code
which can be maintained and worked on by others than the wizzard who
wrote it in the first place.

The grouping is done by "; ". I really had problems to spot the actual
operators as it looks like one large string in the first place.
So which one is more objective ? :)

All printks need to have a loglevel for two reasons:
1) it allows them to be filtered
2) you see which category it is when you read the code

No it is absolutely _NOT_ pointless, it is obfuscation for no reason
other than laziness.
Now your code reads:
	device_read(...);
There is no hint that this might fail.
	if (mtd->read(.....) {
		/* FIXME: I have no clue how to handle this error */
		BUG();
	}
Is entirely clear for all readers. I know that you have no clue, but
others don't :)

Fair enough. Just add some comment, why it is there and how it is going
to be used soon.

Well, neither way does prevent bogus casts. I prefer the explicit one.

Please take this up with the folks in charge of alloc_inode.

Well, you want to have exposure and people who test it. So making it as
easy as possible for all of them is not a bad goal.
