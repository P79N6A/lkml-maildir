Hello,
I have been having the same problem with the 2.4.test2 kernel, when i
compile with modules i get the exact error message as above and I have yet
to try to compile with out modules since there are a few other options i
wanted to run that require modules.  This worked great before with the stock
Redhat 6.1 2.2.14 kernel.  Also is there any docs on the NAT features i saw
in the new kernel menu?  This is one of the options i am trying to get
workign and i am very interested in some docs.  Thanks, keep up the great
work.
