So ia64 spin_unlock doesn't do store-store ordering across it. I'm
surprised this is the first time this causes problems. Other architectures
seem to order:
* sparc64 does a membar StoreStore|LoadStore
* powerpc does lwsync or sync, depending on arch
* alpha does an mb();
* x86 is in-order
So, sounds to me like you need to fix your lock primitives, not add
barriers to generic code?
