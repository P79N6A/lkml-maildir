Ok, so let's stay in the range of gigabit ethernet...

When you have "a few Gb/s links" you would not use your beloved Pentium 100 
MHz to do the job, instead you would go for something like 1.5 GHz P4 or 
Athlon, both of which would be cheaper than the new 64-bit architecture.
Jeff.
P.S. I just looked up the cheapest gigabit copper I could find in 10 seconds, 
and I found: D-Link DGE-500T for $36.27 this is just 4 times the price of the 
cheapest fast ethernet I found on the same site (cdw.com - they are not the 
cheapest, but I like them)
