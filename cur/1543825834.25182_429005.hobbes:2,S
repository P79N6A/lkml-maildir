Gentoo recieved several reports of this. It appears that certain vendors 
are worse than others (Verbatim flash drives are a common culprit).
Some users tested and found that Windows has the same behaviour - it 
rejects these devices on unpowered hubs, and pops up a warning that not 
enough power is available.
I added a printk to point out when configurations are rejected due to 
power issues, this has been merged into Greg's tree. It's far from 
ideal, but better than silent failure...
