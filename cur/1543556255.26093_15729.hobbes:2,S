So what load average should I expect Linux versions 2.2 and 2.4 to perform
well under ?  I'm wondering what would be the best way to solve this
problem: limit the number of processes created during a certain time span;
check if the load average isn't too high before creating a new thread (and
go to sleep if it isn't); or something else ?
Thanks very much BTW !  The list has always been very helpful.  :-)
