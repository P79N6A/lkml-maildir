That's a sort of security by obscurity: if the user is dumb enough he
cannot do any harm.  But I'm not interested in that sort of thing.  If
this issue important, then it should be solved properly, and not just
by "preventing accidents".

The leaf node constranint doesn't make sense.  The hidden mount thing
does, but it has been very flatly rejected by Al Viro.
There's a nice solution to this (discussed at length earlier): private
namespaces.
I think we are still confusing these two issues, which are in fact
separate.
  1) polluting global namespace is bad (find -xdev issue)
  2) not ptraceable (or not killable) processes should not be able to
     access an unprivileged mount
For 1) private namespaces are the proper solution.  For 2) the
fuse_allow_task() in it's current or modified form (to check
killability) should be OK.
1) is completely orthogonal to FUSE.  2) is currently provably secure,
and doesn't seem cause problems in practice.  Do you have a concrete
example, where it would cause problems?
