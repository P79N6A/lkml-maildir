It would be highly advantageous if we could have a file that acts as a 
central registry of architectural sysctl numbers *and have the numbers 
in the kernel derived from there*.  As I've said before, I don't really 
think sys_sysctl is any worse than ad hoc system calls (sys_mips and the 
like), but the real problem is that there are architectural and 
non-archtectural numbers, and they're mixed in all over the place.
I think it would be fair to say that if they're not in <linux/sysctl.h> 
they're not architectural, but that doesn't resolve the counterpositive 
(are there sysctls in <linux/sysctl.h> which aren't architectural?  From 
the looks of it, I would say yes.)  Non-architectural sysctl numbers 
should not be exported to userspace, and should eventually be rejected 
by sys_sysctl.
