Ahh, my apologies then. I am sincerely sorry for any offense I may have  
caused.

The original poster did not provide a specific set of issues that  
needed to be
resolved, they just posted a very messy email with several statements  
that
didn't make sense.  Even later, when they were asked what issues they  
were
having, they just dodged the question.  Then the email that I responded  
to
had the attitude of "You guys are only here to fix my problems," which  
is
totally unacceptable.

Well of course!  I said "lack of organization is _sometimes_ a good  
thing."  I
agree wholeheartedly.  And I'd actually rather not have ls named "dir",  
cause
I'd rather avoid my painful DOS memories. :-D

Ahh, see, from the original poster's comments it was not apparent that  
their
problem was the lack of a standardized build system.  In any case, the
primary problem is the lack of a configured kernel source tree.  My  
advice
to them is to just use the standard module building mechanism:
1)	User decides that he/she wants a module
2)	User cd's to wherever his/her kernel source tree is
3)	User runs "make-kpkg" or whatever his/her distro's kernel tool is.
4)	User installs the package generated.
It seems to me that there should not be an automated kernel or module  
build
procedure.  Either the user knows what they're doing, is following  
directions
over the phone from somebody who knows what their doing, or has no clue.
The users that have no clue should probably not be trying to compile  
their
own modules anyway.
