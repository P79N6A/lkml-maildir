Dunno about the acorn part, but devfs looks broken.
Checking, devfs makefile has some documentation support in the makefile.
I'm tempted to delete it, surely it's not part of the kernel build system,
but I guess someone would yell at me.
If we include the architecture Makefiles:
find -name Makefile |  xargs grep '\.\./' | wc -l
   148
But I'm sure we hit a lot of false positves here.
