Apparently I was a bit behind.  I found 2.3.99pre1 to try.  The same
problem persists as documented in my previous message shown below

Subject: 2.3.52pre3 and ethernet(?) problem
I've had various problems with 2.3.48 thru 2.3.51, mostly due to
netfilter (I'm currently stuck at 2.3.47 until netfilter is fully
integrated - the rest of the family wouldn't take too kindly if their
computers weren't able to access the internet).
Today I got around to trying 2.3.52pre3.  It starts booting, but halts
right after ide-scsi spits out messages about detecting my CD-ROM
drives.  In a normal boot the next messages would be about detecting
ethernet cards, so I assume that is where the problems occur.  Following
are the ethernet messages from a normal boot.
