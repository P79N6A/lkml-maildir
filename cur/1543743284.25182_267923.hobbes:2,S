Well, tty name compatibly reasons with a couple of our drivers.
Most of our new Linux users for a couple of our older products are
coming
from a specific different OS who are adamant that we keep the tty names
the way they were used to under that OS.
Also, I can see some oddball products out there that might need
only 1 tty out there.
Instead of forcing "ttyoddball0" for the name, it would
be nice to let the driver use "ttyoddball", or whatever it wanted.
In fact, it would be similar to the existing entries for "console" and
"ptmx"...
