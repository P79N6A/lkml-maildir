	[snip periodical DSM argument, you've all seen it before]
Obviously DSM works for some situations and horribly breaks
in others. What about sticking non-intrusive DSM code in the
kernel and attach a BIG FAT WARNING to it?
People don't have to use it; as long as the DSM code doesn't
impact a performance of a non-DSM kernel, I really don't see
a problem.
There are no magic bullets, so shooting down DSM because it
isn't a magic bullet seems a bit strange to me...
