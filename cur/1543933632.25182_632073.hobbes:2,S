Pointer to such a report? The only single-device problems I'm aware of
are with some devices within the K8 integrated northbridge, which we
already handle. Other than that, the only non-global problems I'm aware
of are devices behind host bridges which can't receive/handle MMCONFIG
requests, in which case the problem would be bus-wide.
