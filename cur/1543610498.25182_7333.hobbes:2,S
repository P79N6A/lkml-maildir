You already have a System.map, it is in the root of your linux source
directory.  Thus, as you copied vmlinuz over, do the same for
System.map:
	cp System.map /boot/System.map-2.4.15
modules-info is something specific to RedHat which you do not need. 
`make modules_install' is all that is required.  Now, edit your
bootloader (lilo, grub, etc) and reboot.  Enjoy.
