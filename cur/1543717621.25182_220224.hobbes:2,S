Wim explained that any application changes now won't be widely deployed for
another year.  During that period the ability to run existing Oracle setups
requires that hugepage allocation be available to unprivileged
applications.

It means that if people install a kernel.org machine on their database
server, the database *just won't work*.  This is not good for those users,
for the kernel developers or for Linux's reputation in general.
It's worth a very small, extremely easily maintainable patch to fix all
this up.
And this is not just any old application.

One year.

If you need to exaggerate this much to make your point, it isn't a very
good point.

Here's your "horrible unmaintainable mess":
