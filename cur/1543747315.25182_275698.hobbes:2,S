I'd agree with this assessment. The original purpose of the private flag
was reiserfs-internal to avoid locking issues with xattrs-on-xattrs.
SELinux just happened to try to use xattrs-on-xattrs from outside the
filesystem. Without being too familiar with selinux, I used the patch
because it "just worked."
Such a VFS-level flag could provide the same functionality while
allowing me to remove the private flag from reiserfs.
