Legal, yes.  It's also useless (if you really meant it, you ought to
write "foo; bar;" which is equivalent.)  Therefore, it should be fixed
one way or the other.  Unlike a for or while statement with an empty
clause -- which sometimes have legitimate uses -- an if statement with
an empty clause is pretty much useless.  The only case I've seen which
makes sense is if you have something like:
      if (foo)
        ; /* Do nothing */
      else
	bar;
Note that I *highly* recommend having a comment for this case, to
indicate that there really is no mistake.  Same with /* fallthrough */
in switch statements.
I actually would recommend using { } instead of ; as well.
