Oh, sorry, I didn't see that patch.  The specific bug I was trying to
fix was actually in mkdir though (the regression test suite did the
equivalent of rm -rf /mntpt/*, followed by mkdir's which failed).
I can respin the patch versus BK-latest.

We could; it's an error path, after all.  On the other hand, the cost
of ext3_has_free_blocks() is pretty small, and if we know that there's
no point doing the retry, why not skip the work.

Yes, good point.
