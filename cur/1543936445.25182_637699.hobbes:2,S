Erm, well, you can't decouple them.  Having a differing blk queue bounce
mask and device mask is going to cause huge trouble.  The reason is this
insidious nasty called swiotlb.  Basically, with it enabled (and again,
it can be on ia64 or x86_64), the kernel can bypass the bounce limit
safe in the knowledge that swiotlb will fix up behind in the dma_map_
Unfortunately, if the device mask doesn't match the queue mask then
swiotlb will never kick in and you'll end up with mapped pages beyond
the 4GB limit.

Unfortunately, the stack trace probably won't help, since the command
likely gets issued from the block request function, so the trace won't
go back to the culpable initiator; that's why the command would be
helpful.
