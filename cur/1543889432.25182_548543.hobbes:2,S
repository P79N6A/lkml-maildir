Alan,
If NCPFS has little use these days, how are the linux users meant to 
sign on to Novell networks without using the (IMHO) bloatware provided 
by Novell?
In fact, Novell's client only work on SLED first time lucky (everything 
else needs extra libs and a lot of work) so it's hardly much use.  I'll 
have a go with the ls, and strace ls and the dodgy file and see what 
happens.
If there's a pointer to ncpfs, I might take a brief look and see what 
happens.
Thanks,
Chris
