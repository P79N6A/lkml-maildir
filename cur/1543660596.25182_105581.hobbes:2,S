   The last sentence in the quote above indicates that it is not intended
   (by the PCI spec) to be a per-driver decision, but rather a system
   decision. The messages used are also a per-bus system resource and how
   an MSI goes from the PCI bus to the rest of the system (i.e. the CPU(s))
   is implementation dependent.
Yes, this is understood.
But the tg3 hw designers have decided to do something which makes this
not possible.
So, for tg3's case, it has to become a driver specific decision
whether to support MSI or not.
