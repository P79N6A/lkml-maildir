	You're probably really just annoyed with physical memory that's too small
to hold your working set. Believe it or not, having swap delays the onset of
this problem.

because you say:

	Of course, this is because the working set has changed. However, with swap,
the least used pages can be evicted from physical memory. Without it, there
may be no place to put the least used pages and more frequently used pages
have to be evicted.

	It depends what you mean by "stuffed". On a modern operating system like
Linux, pretty much all of your physical memory is in use all the time.
Without swap, dirty pages cannot be evicted from physical memory, even if
they haven't been used for days. If your physical memory exceeds your
working set size, you win no matter what. But without swap, every dirty page
is part of your working set, even if it hasn't been read/written for days.

	No, it's not difficult. The OS takes physical memory back all the time by
swapping.
	You seem to be missing a fundamental concept. Physical memory will always
get full because the OS will always keep copies of file data in memory just
in case it needs them again. Because new pages are always being read in and
processes are always allocating new memory, the OS will have to make a
decision of what pages to evict from physical memory. If a page is dirty, it
can only be evicted if there's swap. So if you have dirty pages that are
very rarely used, swap allows you to keep more hot, clean pages in memory.
	A lot of people feel subjectively that swap makes a system slow. There's
anecdotal evidence that swap does horrible things or "must be badly broken
because the machine gets slow" on almost every operating system that
supports swapping. In most cases, it's just a case where the real working
set has exceeded physical memory, and in that case, swap is just doing what
it's supposed to be doing.
