I have a CPU which does nothing but poll a port. I want to detect
when the sun comes up which happens once a day. There is a photo
controller relay connected to that port. I need to know this time
within one second.
Therefore I need to poll this port at least twice per second.
Twice comes from Shannon since this has become a sampled system.
Do we care how much time it takes to poll this port as long as
the specified conditions are met? This is the latency and, in
fact we don't care as long as the required specifications are
met. If the latency is 1/2 second, we can't guarantee that the
port is polled twice per second. However, if the latency is
one microfortnight less than 1/2 second we can.
