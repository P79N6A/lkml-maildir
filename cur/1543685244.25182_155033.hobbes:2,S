We currently have some fairly serious IRQ problems with yenta at the
moment.  I'm holding all patches until we get this problem resolved -
it seems to be caused by several bad changes over the past couple of
years accumulating throughout the 2.5 series.
Therefore, I don't want to add any further changes into the mix just
yet.
Also, assigning to socket->socket.ops->init modifies the global
yenta_socket_operations structure, which I'm far from happy about.
