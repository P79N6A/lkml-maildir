That's not very attractive.  This would be the only user of
__DECLARE_SEMAPHORE_GENERIC() in the tree.  It seems that all architectures
(apart from uml) do implement this (although I didn't verify that they all
offer the same interface for it).  But still...
And no, we don't appear to have a proper interface to statically declare a
locked semaphore.  Nor do we appear to have one for mutexes(!).

I think it would be better to go back to initialising emsgs_lock at runtime
rather than fattening the exported semaphore API like this.
emssgs_sema is a weird-looking thing.  There really should be some comments
in there because it is unobvious what the code is attempting to do.
What is the code attempting to do?
It appears to me that nblocked_emsgs_readers gets incorrectly decremented
if the down_interruptible() got interrupted, btw.
