Same story in my case.

Agreed. It's not by far the only bug though. There are at least another two I
recall. First, have you tried editing any disklabels with fdisk? Generally
after deleting say the 'b' and 'e' partitions from a disklabel with 'a' to 'f'
and then trying to add them back in will completely screw fdisks calculations
and it will become impossible to write out a correct disklabel. I had to redo
the disklabel from the beginning a couple of times before I worked this out.
Second, it is a well known problem that either fdisk or the kernel (I think
it's just a missed out call to ioctl() in fdisk) will not re-scan the
disklabel after writing it, thus people have to reboot before it is
recognised.
