I need to relook at this.  But I believe Oleg found an idiom bug in
f_getown that will also apply here.  Basically if the update is not
an atomic transaction then we need to hold a lock when updating the
struct pid pointer so updates and uses of the pointer don't race.
Assuming I need to address that.  I will place spawnpid, spawnsig,
and their lock into a structure and see if I can give it a little
bit better name.
My only defense.  I didn't change the name in the first place. :)
