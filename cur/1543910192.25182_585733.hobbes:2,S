Which has been fixed for some time now; it was caused by legacy
drivers, which are incapable of hotplugging.

I'm not the one who's advocating a change here.  If you want to
first change/break and then fix things, all of that is up to you.

Legacy drivers of the "create my own device node" ilk will never
be able to hotplug ... since it's the /sys/device/... node creation
which causes any "find my driver" hotplug event.  (Like "i82365".)
That bug has been *FIXED* for some time now, as far as I hear.
And that's based on having looked at several hundred platform
drivers to make sure of it... mostly that's not legacy code, so
it can hotplug just fine.

That's news to me.  Of course, the breakage could also be in
those setups ... legacy drivers with legacy setup shouldn't
break, but they don't necessarily obey enough of the rules
that newer tools expect.

Module init tools "blacklist" is squirrely, yes ... it
ignores *most* of the names that "modprobe" accepts,
so it can't actually "blacklist" modules from loading.
The ancient "alias modname none" trick still has life.
