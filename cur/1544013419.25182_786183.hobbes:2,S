This looks very useful, thanks for sharing.

Why? I would imagine it to be useful to get immediate feedback
whether changing the option was successful. It should be easy to
run scripts/kconfig/conf -o on the config file afterwards.
My normal workflow when changing single options is to remove the
line from .config and call make oldconfig again. What I would
like to see most here is something like
./scripts/config --reconfigure smp
Remove SMP from .config, and do oldconfig to ask again.
