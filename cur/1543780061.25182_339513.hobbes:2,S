I am not exactly sure what the above means.  Is 'DEFAULT' a system
default numa allocation policy?

I totally agree.

Sorry, I really wasn't clear.  That statement referred to huge pages
specifically.  I was trying to point out that numa policy-aware huge
page allocation combined with demand faulting in SLES9/i386 has been a
success.

Unless I am missing something, the call to follow_hugetlb_page() in
get_user_pages() is just an optimization.  Removing it means
follow_page() will be called individually for each PAGE_SIZE page in the
huge page.  We can probably do better but I didn't want to cloud this
patch with that logic.
