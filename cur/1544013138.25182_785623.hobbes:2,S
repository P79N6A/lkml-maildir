It's not:
Inversion of the led_on flag does make LED state work properly
and is the right thing to do since an LED
_as seen by the authoritative LED layer_
__has__ to have proper on/off configuration,
regardless of whether having a WLAN LED on-by-default and
off-on-traffic _in the WLAN layer_ is desireable.
(witness wrong state of default-on and heartbeat triggers)
Or, IOW: logical state has to be maintained properly,
at _each layer_ that is involved.

linux/net/mac80211/led.c/ieee80211_led_rx() does simple on/off alternation
via a counter increment modulo, thus somewhat weird LED state toggling
does seem a natural outcome given the current implementation.
I believe the 80211 layer itself should provide some generic LED
handling which then provide for reliable and _identical_ displaying of
WLAN LEDs. It's not a good idea to have individual drivers
mess with custom rssi-indicating LED type implementations,
this should be centralized to have one template for an RSSI LED.
More notes:
. checks of AR5K_NUM_GPIO most certainly are buggy: off-by-1
  (range sems to be 0-5, _not_ 1-6)
. prepend "Acer" to "Aspire One" in this patch
  since Acer is major AR5007EG customer
. testing GPIOs other than 3 (0-6) didn't succeed in making the other
  LED work - what is the behaviour with Linpus, is there an rfkill LED
  there?
