I'll put them all to ubi.h to start with. I am still not convinced
having one big header is more readable then per-unit headers.

Done.

Good point, done. Left only wl_entries_slab, wl_prot_entry_slab, and
eba_ltree_entry_slab.

I need a wrapper for VID header allocation, so better to leave this for
symmetry.
