	Nope. Remember that I have buffers below PPP. The transmit
path within PPP and IrNET is minimal (no framing), so buffers in PPP
and below PPP are logically equivalent.

	We are running circles. I want to reduce the amount of buffers
below TCP. This includes PPP buffers and buffers below PPP (both are
logically equivalent).
	Both of you are saying "increase buffers at PPP level and
reduce below TCP", but this doesn't make sense, and that's what I was
pointing out. You have to think on the whole stack, not each
individual component.

	I get 3.2 Mb/s TCP throughput over a 4Mb/s IrDA link layer, so
I'm not concernet with max performance. My question is more "how much
buffers can I trim without impacting performance". The goal is to
improve latency and decrease ressource consumption.
