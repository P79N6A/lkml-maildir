Hi.
I just wanted to say that my friend who also has an Intel Etherexpress
100 had this problem a little while ago when his girlfriend was installing
RH60 using ftp.
He had ping of about 20000ms or more. We tried to down the interface and
up it again, his girlfriends installation continued, but this only solved
the problem for about maximum 1 minute. 
His kernel was 2.2.5

(Linus, when upgrading linux.cs.helsinki.fi, and after using the machine
for several months.)
