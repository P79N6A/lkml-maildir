Andrew,
Hold up!  Recall some changes can not be micro sliced.  If this the case
also, you need to evaluate assigning to a selected committee to be formed
to review and parse.
If you do not understand the scope of the change set, then find somebody
(pural if needed) to parse and report.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
