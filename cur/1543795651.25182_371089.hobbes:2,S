Also, this has become a FAQ. One needs a context with which to
associate file descriptors and even file buffers. Whose did he
steal? When he finds out, he will find the buffer that never
got written to the file.
Again, to read/write files from inside the kernel either create
a kernel thread, steal init's context, or don't.
