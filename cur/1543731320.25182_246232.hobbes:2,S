Before your change and after mine, 1; with your change, 0.

Well, that's what you changed it to, when you patched from the original
		end_index = isize >> PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT;
to		end_index = (isize - 1) >> PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT;
But the "nr <= offset" check(s) relies on the original convention:
		0 to 4095			0
		4096 to 8191			1

No!

You're expecting end_index to be the index of the last (possibly
incomplete) page of the file.  And that might be a reasonable way
of working it (though the special case of an empty file hints not).
But the nr,offset checks (I say checks because I added another like
the one further down, hopefully to fix the extra readahead issue)
require the original convention.  Just try it out with numbers.
