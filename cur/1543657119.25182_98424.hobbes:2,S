I do not say that driver is perfect. But at least it worked... on wide variety
of architectures.

Yes. Without text mode support. But without textmode support that driver is
of no use for me because of it is not compatible with VMware then.
You know that I'm not forcing my view to anybody. I just wrote matroxfb to
fullfill my needs, and that's everything.

I do not need that. I just need API which will allow at least same functionality
which old API offered. Nothing more, and of course, nothing less. For now
I just added putc/putcs into the fbops, and matroxfb uses its own while
other drivers can use default accel_putc(s) directly. Of course uploading
font data to the hardware will need more hooks... Another interesting question
is how can I have different resolutions on different virtual terminals...
An 640x16 bitmap is of no use for me if I just want to put 80 characters
on text terminal. Or if I want to tell to the accelerator what character it
should retrieve from its onboard font cache...
