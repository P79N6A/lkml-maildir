right now CLONE_SIGNAL and CLONE_SIGHAND is used for new async threads, 
so they should inherit and share all the signal settings.
one area that definitely needs more work is that the ptrace parent (if 
any) should probably follow the 'head' context. gdb at the moment copes 
surprisingly well, but some artifacts are visible every now and then.

i'm really sorry - i still have a huge email backlog.

yes. My plan is to to avoid all these problems by having a 
special-purpose sched_yield_to(old_task, new_task) function.
this, besides being even faster than the default scheduler (because the 
runqueue balance does not change so no real scheduling decision has to 
be done - the true scheduling decisions happen later on at async-wakeup 
time), should also avoid all the FPU races: the FPU just gets flipped 
between old_task and new_task (and TS_USEDFPU needs to be moved as well, 
etc.). No intermediate task can come inbetween.
can you see a hole in this sched_yield_to() method as well?
