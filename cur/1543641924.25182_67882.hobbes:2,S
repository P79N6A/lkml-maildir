Wouldn't you be able to use something like the following code to do ilookup?
Jan
static int dont_set(struct inode *inode, void *data)
{
	return -1;
}
struct inode *ilookup(struct super_block *sb, struct list_head *head,
		      int (*test)(struct inode *, void *), void *data)
{
	return iget5_locked(sb, head, test, dont_set, data);
}
