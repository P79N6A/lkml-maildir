Try turning off the BIOS support for keyboards.  Kinda sounds like Linux
isn't taking over the USB controller properly.  Does the keyboard work
without _any_ usb modules loaded?  If so, then that's probably the
problem.

But then again, if these are working at the same time as your keyboard,
it looks like Linux took over the controller nicely.
Sorry, I guess this wasn't much help.
