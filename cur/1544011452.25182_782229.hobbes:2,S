This is fine by me, however:
1. Can you add some comments to say "this is not for core vm but for pat,
   oh and a pgoff of zero is not going to work".
2. Can you please justify to me (or the changelog) roughly why PAT wants
   to know if the mapping is linear or not? Presumably it has to handle
   both types? If performance wasn't an issue, then you could manually scan
   the ptes to verify (which would solve your zero-offset bug). etc.
