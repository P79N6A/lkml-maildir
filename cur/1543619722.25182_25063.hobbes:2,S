Not that it helps other than a slight data point, but I was seeing the
same problem with an HP NetRAID controller (based on MegaRAID) which
exhibited the same problems when in i2o emulation. Switching to mass
storage emulation fixed the issue.

According to Arjen, the controller's i2o emulation is half-assed. ;-)
