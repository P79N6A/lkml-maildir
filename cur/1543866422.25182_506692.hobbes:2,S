Hi Christoph,
Sure I think it would be a good idea to shorten the name. And yes, although
I just construct the iterator to pass into perform_write, I think it should
make sense to go much further up the call stack instead of passing all those
args around. iodesc seems like a fine name, so I'll use that unless
anyone objects.
Thanks,
Nick
