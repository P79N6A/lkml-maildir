Either way, you don't measure it. Doesn't matter. As I said, off topic.

If it were generated by some real workload that cares, then I would care.

I don't think it is lame at all. They're fairly important in use in mmap_sem
that I know of. And I have seen workloads where the up_write path gets really
expensive (arguably more relevant ones than hackbench).
PS. I'd like to see you argue how they're broken in behaviour, and how
you're going to replace mmap_sem -- this is not a rhetorical statement,
I'd really be interested to see ;)
