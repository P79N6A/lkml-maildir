Yes, that's why I wanted to use Intel's compiler for kernel (of course
I didn't mean to use C++; the product's name is C++, it doesn't sell C
alone.)    Its vectorization is so nice that SETI@home calculates
20-30% faster than the original one compiled with gcc.
But I thought it's not such a good idea to build kernel with Intel
compiler, because kernel's speed doesn't affect so much in my case. 
And that vectorization isn't so effective in kernel.  PGO (profile
guided optimization) is the only effective optimization in the kernel
according to
http://softwareforums.intel.com/ids/board/message?board.id=16&message.id=1504
So I decided not to try this...looks like too much effort and little
gain.  and I guess that's why nobody is trying this now.
