Many thnks, Linus
The current BK 2.5 tree fixes all my DRI and AGP related problems.
I did stress it very hard running various screensavers and quake 3,
so far everything is all right.
I'm currently using XFree from CVS:
XFree86 Version 4.3.99.3
Release Date: 29 April 2003
X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0, Release 6.6
Build Operating System: Linux 2.4.20 i686 [ELF]
Build Date: 01 May 2003
"Page Flipping" and "AGP Fast Write" are enabled,
AGP speed is set to "1" (the default ?).
Thanks a lot,
Patrick
