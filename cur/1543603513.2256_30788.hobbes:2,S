3ware has decided to discontinue their escalade series IDE RAID controller
cards.  The drivers were open source and in the kernel tree.
As a side note, all 7810 cards are being recalled due to possible data
corruption under heavy load.  7800 cards need a firmware upgrade also.  If
you have a 7000 series card in production, be careful!
