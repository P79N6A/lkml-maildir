 MBT> Is this fixable the "right" way?
On my box, which started its life as a RH7, I've been editing
/etc/security/console.perms as I've discovered problems.
I don't know if this is the right way but thus far I've:
 - changed the <console> line to read:
<console>=tty[0-9][0-9]* vc/[0-9][0-9]* :[0-9]\.[0-9] :[0-9]
   (just added the vc/... pattern)
 - changed the <cdrom> line to read:
<cdrom>=/dev/cdroms/* /dev/cdwriter*
   (removed the /dev/cdrom* and added /dev/cdroms/*)
I have not had reason (ie. xmms works) to change the sound settings,
which are:
<sound>=/dev/dsp* /dev/audio* /dev/midi* \
        /dev/mixer* /dev/sequencer
Hope that helps.
