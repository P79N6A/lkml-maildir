Actually in modern 2.6 kernels there are two separate output entropy
pools for /dev/random and /dev/urandom.  So assuming that the
adversary doesn't know the contents of the current state of the
entropy pool (i.e., the RNG is well seeded with entropy), you can read
all you want from /dev/urandom and that won't give an adversary
successful information to attack /dev/random.
