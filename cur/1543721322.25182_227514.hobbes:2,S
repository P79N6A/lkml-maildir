And here we see a, possibly the, problem.
The BIOS gives us usable memory up to 0x3f7cffff, but the
corresponding MTTR stops short at 0x3effffff, which leaves
the 8MB in [0x3f000000,0x3f7cffff] usable but uncached.
Any access to that range will be sloooow.
This is unfortunately not an uncommon BIOS error. You may want to
check for BIOS updates, or file a bug report with the HW vendor.
Booting with "mem=1008M" appended to the kernel's options
should fix the performance issue.
