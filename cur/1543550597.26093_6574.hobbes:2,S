how does their xor method work ? do you know about an
RFC stating about this, that I could read ? I'm
really interested in this since I must propose a
completely redondant switch/server solution for a big
project here. The more I will know about their trunk,
the best I may be able to do :-)

at first, I wanted to code it exactly this way, but
I then realize that the comparison to zero is simpler
for the CPU than a comparison between 2 pointers. But
in fact, it's one less variable so one less register.

If I have some spare time, I'll implement an
active/backup mode for two interfaces connected to 2
different switches, with a "deaf" backup. Perhaps I'll
also disable the MII monitoring by default to avoid
breaking existing implementations.

ok thanks, I'll do. If you agree, I'll also modify the
documentation to explain how to use link monitoring.
