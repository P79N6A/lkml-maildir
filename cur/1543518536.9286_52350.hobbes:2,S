The timer interrupt happens in the middle of the bottom half, and when the
bh complete it doesn't check if there's something new marked. But the
timer interrupt could happen also in the other CPU a picosecond before
we'll release the global_bh_count lock. So to fix all races a spinlock is
necessary. For UP a pair of __sti(); __cli() inside the while( active = )
would be enough (and I did it yesterday night). But that's not enough for
SMP.
