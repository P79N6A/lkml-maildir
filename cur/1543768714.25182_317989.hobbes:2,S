it's all a bit tricky. The short story is that i think both vanilla and 
-RT kernels are fine.
Here is how smp_send_reschedule() is used:
	CPU#0				CPU#1
	set_tsk_need_resched(rq->curr);
	...
	smp_send_reschedule()
			--- IPI --->
					smp_reschedule_interrupt();
					...
					entry.S's need_resched check
_but_, this is intentionally racy: if CPU#1 happens to reschedule before 
the IPI reaches CPU#1 (an IPI can take 10 usecs easily so the window is 
not small), then need_resched might be cleared before the IPI hits. In 
that case you wont get a reschedule after the IPI hits, because it was 
done before!
so the correct thing to measure is what the -RT kernel's wakeup-latency 
timing feature does: the time from setting need_resched, to the point 
the task starts to run. The feature works on SMP too - and it doesnt 
show any large latencies.
are you seeing actual process delays? If not then i think those large 
latencies are just the result of the wrong assumptions in your 
measurement code.
