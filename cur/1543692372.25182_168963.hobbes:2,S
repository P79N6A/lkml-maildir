AFAIK, Con's scheduler doesn't change the nice implementation at all.
Possibly some of his changes amplify its problems, or, more likely they
remove most other scheduler problems leaving this one noticable.
If X is running at -20, and xmms at +19, xmms is supposed to still get
5% of the CPU. Should be enough to run fine. Unfortunately this is
achieved by giving X very large timeslices, so xmms's scheduling latency
becomes large. The interactivity bonuses don't help, either.
