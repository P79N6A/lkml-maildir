That's not true; it's more likely on Altix, but it's not unique.  *any*
PCI-PCI bridge can reorder pci config reads and writes.  Apparently the
normal PCI host bridge implementation avoids this problem by blocking
until the completion comes back.  If you put a quad-port tulip card into
an Altix, you could experience the same problem (but it would be
massively unlikely.  You'd probably have to bring up three interfaces,
saturate them with traffic, then bring up the fourth to see it.  And
even then it would be rare).

There's several places in the PCI midlayer that require the config write
to have completed before we do a config read.  The MWI code relies on
this to see if the device supports MWI.  If it gets out of order, we'll
think that the device doesn't support MWI when it thinks it's been told
to use MWI.  Data corruption could result.

I really don't think so.  At worst you'll be changing the timing.
