The comment would be true if tty_flip_buffer_push() attempted to block
with tty->low_latency set, but it doesn't AFAICS. One possibility for
deadlock is if the tty->buf.lock spinlock is taken on behalf of a user
process...

That was a long time ago, but the race is something like this:
      * data is received, enough to completely fill the tty buffer
      * tty_flip_buffer_push() schedules flush_to_ldisc()
      * before flush_to_ldisc() runs, more data is received
      * flush_to_ldisc() truncates the incoming data (look for
        tty->receive_room)
I don't see how this is supposed to work in general. I suppose most
PC-standard char drivers are not capable of overflowing a tty buffer
before the host can empty it. I wasn't comfortable with hoping for that
condition in my driver.
Setting "low_latency" ensures that throttle will be called immediately
if the tty buffer is filled, avoiding the race.
