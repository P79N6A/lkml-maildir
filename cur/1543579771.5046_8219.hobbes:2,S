Problem is that there's stuff like this all over the place.  Plus,
just because something is undefined by the standard doesn't mean
it's not useful -- it's not possible to write either a kernel or
libc without breaking some rules.
So any useful compile-time restrictions we could make is if the
static expression was not computable (perhaps due to being a word
addressed machine), or if we could somehow magically divine that
the store would in fact go wrong at runtime.
