The policy is, never ever include kernel headers from userspace.
Your libc should provide a "sanitized" version of the kernel headers,
which is completely separate from any kernel sources.
dietlibc does this...  it's completely independent of kernel header changes.
RedHat will be doing this with glibc in the future.
So, any problems should be reported to your libc maintainer :)
