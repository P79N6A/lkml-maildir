I don't understnad this report much, but it sounds like a very recent
regression.
You're not actually trying to suspend the machine at the time, are you?
And it doesn't sound like the keyboard has malfunctioned?
Does anyone know where this "ENTERING SLEEPING MODE" message is coming
from?  A bit of googling makes me suspect that it is actually coming from
your monitor, which perhaps indicates that the kernel is sending incorrect
DPMS signalling to the monitor, or something like that?
