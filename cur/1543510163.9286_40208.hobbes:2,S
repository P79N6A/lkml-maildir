	Hello All, I have a linux router running 2.0.3x .  I need to
	monitor its traffic activity .  I have been successfully
	monitoring the 2.1.x -> 2.2.x systems with MRTG .
	I am wondering if the patch to the kernel procfs is still needed
	to get the per byte traffic statistics for snmp ?
		Tia,  JimL
