The inquiry data from your devices seem correct.

Thanks for helping debug the thing.
You may also enable some debugging messages in drivers.
The st driver needs to be recompiled with DEBUG defined. For the
ncr53c8xx you can send the following command at run time before 
starting your tests:
      echo "setdebug phase result nego tags" >/proc/scsi/ncr53c8xx/0
You may also try to get some debug outputs from scsi.c, but this probably 
will populate you log too much and make things ununderstandable.
You may just do 2 tests, one with minimal output messages and another 
one will full debug messages and report me the outputs.
Regards,
   Gerard.
