Here was the latest thread where this was brought up:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=105544548100008
I would suggest reading this post from Linus for a quick summary:

Yes there is a standard.  Have you read the docs at
http://linux-hotplug.sf.net/
 ?  Also my 2001 OLS paper details the
format the messages should be in, but it's a bit out of date as to the
new values that the 2.6 kernel sends.
What do you want to use the hotplug interface for that it currently does
not do?
Hope this helps,
