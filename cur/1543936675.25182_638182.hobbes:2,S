Just to clarify a little bit:
If ext3's DIO code only touches transactions in get_block, then it can
violate data=ordered rules.  Basically the transaction that allocates
the blocks might commit before the DIO code gets around to writing them.
A crash in the wrong place will expose stale data on disk.
