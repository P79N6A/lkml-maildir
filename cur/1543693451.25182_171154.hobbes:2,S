That's not true.
It's true that if you use the pthreads model, you'll pass fd's between 
threads freely.
But there are lots of other valid thread usages. Many of the original uses 
of Linux threading were for special-case apps which used the clone() 
interface directly. Some were games, where the native threading stuff was 
doing things like sound etc in the background.
And when you have _that_ kind of model (with assymetric specialized 
threads), it makes perfect sense for the threads to have independent file 
descriptors.

And that is what you get with pthreads.
But the native Linux threading has never been pthreads. It's been about a 
much more generic thing, where the user is in control of what he does.
And that, btw, implies that thread nazis that only use pthreads do _not_ 
get to determine what the rest of the world does.
