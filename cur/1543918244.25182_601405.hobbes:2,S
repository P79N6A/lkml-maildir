Yeah yeah OK, you turn it off in the parent cpuset of the child cpusets
which you want the partitioning to occur in, and ensure there are no
other overlapping cpusets with that flag turned on in order to create a
hard partition. I don't think this makes the API anynicer.

OK, if it prohibits balancing when sched_load_balance is 0, then it is
slightly more useful.

Yeah, but the interface is not very nice. As an interface for hard
partitioning, it doesn't work nicely because it is hierarchical.

What do you mean by bastardized? What's wrong with having a real
(and sane) representation of the requested hard-partitions in the system?

Not your proposal, just the idea to have enough information to be able
to work out a more optimal set of sched-domains automatically. Actually
we can do most of it already automatically, but not hard partitioning.

As I said, neither is really semantically more powerful than the other. So
yeah those things are possible to do with your API, but I don't like the API.
