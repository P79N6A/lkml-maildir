Subject: Six archs are missing atomic_inc_return()

 Six archs do not have the atomic_inc_return() macro as of 2.6.10-rc2:
  cris
  h8300
  m32r
  ppc
  ppc64
  s390
net/core/neighbour.c:neigh_alloc() uses this macro.  Does that mean these
archs can't build network configs that use it?
 (Also, some archs do not seem to parenthesize the macro enough.  Only
sparc and parisc get it right.)
