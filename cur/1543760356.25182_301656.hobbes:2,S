Hi Adrian,
I have somewhat mixed feeling about the patch. Some solutions is
definitely needed but I don't like allocating memory that will never
be used. I think I would perfer #ifdefing gameport support is OSS
modules, _if_ #ifdefs are out of line and not in the middle of code
path.
I'll let Vojtech decide which way he wants to go - he could probably
apply the patch and then we could convert drivers one by one and kill
the stubs later.
