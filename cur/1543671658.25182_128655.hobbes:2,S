Thanks for the suggestions, I'm kinda new at this and just following the TODO 
which unfortuately says "sed s/return EWHATEVER/return -EWHATEVER/". I'll 
work on checking the things you suggested. As for your other questions, the 
kernel did build but I didn't attempt to boot it, I'll be sure to do so in 
the future. Thanks for the encouragement.
P.S. Anyone who works on KernelJanitor, kj.pl is suggesting some of the things 
I'm changing which aparently I shouldn't.
Building the Future,
