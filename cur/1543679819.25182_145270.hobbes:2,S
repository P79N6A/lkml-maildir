The packet counters are fine (for now, that is), but the tx_bytes and rx_bytes 
counters need those 64-bits. 4GB (= 2^32 bytes) is not enough. For example:
- - gigabit ethernet will cause 32-bit counters to overflow about every 34 
seconds (at full speed.)
- - 10Gb/s ethernet will only take about 3.4 seconds
- - a user like me, who has 5Mbit/s connection to the net can cause the counter 
to overflow in 1 hour 54 minutes
(Most of the time, the devices are not maxed out, but we have to check the 
worst case scenario.) Now, how often should the user space 
statistics-gathering program should run? Well, at least every 30 seconds, for 
now that should be good, but the rein of 10Gb/s is approaching...

I agree with you, that is why I made it optional so the user may choose to 
sacrifice performace for statistics when needed.
Additionally, I am sure there is a way of optimizing the patch I wrote (i.e. 
actual transmition is locked with a lock from struct net_device.) I am aware 
that this patch is a major undertaking, but it is only a matter of time 
before someone will have to do it anyway.

Very true.
Jeff.
