Hi,
	I am trying to run a multi threaded application on kernel 2.4.5.
The application vanishes without leaving any trace (no core dump) when
there is a link up on the hardware I use. If I try to debug I see the
application being killed because of SIGFPE. Can anyone throw some light
on this please? Also please cc the answer to me as I am not a member of
the list.
Thanks and Regards
Sreeram
