I don't get what your indirection is supposed to do.
 userspace -> sys_open -> kernel space -> create file
           -> sys_close -> kernel space -> close it
vs
 userspace -> sys_mycall -> kernelspace -> sys_open -> create_file
                                        -> sys_close -> create_file
As for code snippets:
asmlinkage logn sys_mycall(const char __user *filename,
    unsigned int flags, unsigned int mode)
{
	long ret;
	ret = sys_open(filename, flags, mode);
	if (ret < 0)
		return ret;
	return sys_close(fd);
}
You see, this is currently just too trivial to make sense, but if
it helps you, no problem.
