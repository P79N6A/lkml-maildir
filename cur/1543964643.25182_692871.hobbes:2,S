That's what I thought when I had my system working fine with just one
server.  The client was very simple. :-)
Since, I learned that my clients need to have parts of the complex
server protocol for fast, safe transactions (think ACID (or ACI)) over
relatively slow links, especially with multiple servers.
Also, efficiently recovering from a link/server failure, when clients
have large zero-latency caches (using leases), appears similar to the
synchronising protocol between recovering servers.
But, on the bright side, these things are only necessary for
performance in scenarios you might not encounter or care about :-)
I'm finding it's a really interesting but large problem.
