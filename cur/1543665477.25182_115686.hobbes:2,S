> We need to get rid of the artifical major/minor split completly
I do not disagree with you, but your point of view seems
to be that either we make everything perfect or we do nothing.
I prefer slow progress.
Concerning this split - traces of it occur in a very large
number of places. Let me just mention the raw device that
I did this afternoon. How does one connect a raw device
with a block device? Using a struct raw_config_request
from user space. And look
struct raw_config_request
{
        int     raw_minor;
        __u64   block_major;
        __u64   block_minor;
};
One of the many places that has a built-in major/minor split.
Basically this split is unimportant. A dev_t is just a cookie.
But as soon as you start looking at details this split is
all over the place.
