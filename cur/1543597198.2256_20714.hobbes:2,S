btw, I also made a port of the blkdev in pagecache rev 5 against
2.4.7pre6+o_direct-10. So to test blkdev in pagecache you can also apply
in order:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.4/2.4.7pre5/o_direct-10
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.4/2.4.7pre6/blkdev-pagecache-5
on top of 2.4.7pre6.
