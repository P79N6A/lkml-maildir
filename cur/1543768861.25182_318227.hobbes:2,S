 BLKPREP_KILL is only used to kill illegal (unpreparable, way-off)
requests.  Actually, for special requests, the only tests performed
are req->flags and CDB_SIZE tests.  I don't think anyone does/will
submit that illegal requests via scsi_wait_req().  And if so, it will
be a bug.
 I don't feel strong against keeping the end_io routine but, if you
decide to keep the routine, please consider adding a comment
explaining the peculiar path the routine might be used, such that
other people don't have to wander through the code.
 Thanks.
