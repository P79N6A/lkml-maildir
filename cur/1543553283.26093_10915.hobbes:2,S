What means "using kgcc" ?. I think it should be done even before.
It is not using "egcs" as you seem to be thinking. You cant put your
preferred compiler in kgcc.
Even I think it could include some general options for all the kernel build.
Think of packages like ALSA drivers grepping or analizing the kernel Makefile
to find that options are -fomit-frame-pointer -malign=xxxx and so on.
And that options can change from version to version of gcc. 
Simpler: build a script (what kgcc is). An external module package, use kgcc.
