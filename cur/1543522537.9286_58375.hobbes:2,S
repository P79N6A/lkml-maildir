I've written a network block device daemon (nbdd)
server running within the kernel.
The network block device client (nbd, currently part
of the main Linux kernel) enables a Linux machine to
access a block device or file on a remote machine as
one of its own block devices.
The network block device daemon server (nbdd) enables
a Linux box to export one of its local block devices
or files to a Linux box running the nbd client.
The network block device daemon kernel patch
(kernel 2.3.39) is available at
http://sites.netscape.net/sebtomac/nbd/nbdd.html
Where you also can find HOWTO and user land
administration tools.
It would be of interest to get comments and criticism.
