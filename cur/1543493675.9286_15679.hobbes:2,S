Hi Arni:
It could be possible that you have not set the routes in the 
boxes 1 and 3 for each other. The ping packets from 1 may get 
to 3 but may not know the way to route it back. 
Let me know if this works...
Also, I don't know why there are two entries in the table. 
I have seen it myself in some cases. I would like to know 
the reason too..
Best,
Sarav
