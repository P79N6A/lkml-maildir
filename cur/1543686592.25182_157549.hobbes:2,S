They aren't, in the sense of cryptographically signing a document.
They do reveal less information about the input than SHA-1.

That's exactly what Ted described as his reason for doing the folding
in the first place.  Matt Mackall simply pointed out that a little bit
of information theory will show you that throwing away half the output
is more effective.
I think Matt's doing an excellent job.  His understanding of the
mathematics involved certainly exceeds that of 99% of the operating
systems developers I've met.
