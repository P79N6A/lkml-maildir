Hi,
I haven't made special tests to compare 2.6.22-cfs19 and 2.6.22-ck1,
but I see performance superiority of 2.6.22-ck1 using my own eyes.
Especially in mozilla-firefox ...
Using 2.6.22 or 2.6.22-cfs19 my firefox hangs for some time(~4-5
seconds) when I'm trying to open any url, but with 2.6.22-ck1 firefox
doesn't hang at all or at least for a second when I have lots of open
tabs.
What is the reason? Had Con made better scheduler than cfs and O(1) in
general kernel?
Kernel configuration in 2.6.22, 2.6.22-ck1, 2.6.22-cfs19 is similar.
