The other thing to note is that I'm not really very happy with my driver
at present. It may be working well for some people, but *I* think it
needs some rework before it's really ready for primetime again. I need
to split out the SCSI && FC dependencies. I need to move the name server
code out of the main body and make it more policy driven.
The trouble is also that it's just a hobby for me right now (no clients
with direct Linux support requirements) , and as a recent parent I've
had a lot less hobby time.
