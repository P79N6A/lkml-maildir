Hi,
I've just spotted a small problem with 2.4.0-test8 running netfilter:
NAT: 3 dropping untracked packet c065d3a0 1 192.168.0.1 -> 192.168.0.9
This seems to be caused when you have connection tracking enabled, and
you ping the local network broadcast address.  The filter rules specific
to the ethernet interface where this packet originated from and the above
response was dropped has the filter rules setup thus:
 iptables -A INPUT  -i eth0   -j ACCEPT
 iptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0   -j ACCEPT
There isn't any NAT in operation on eth0 (but there is NAT for packets
going via other interfaces).
If you require more information on the setup, let me know, and I'll provide
it in private mail.
