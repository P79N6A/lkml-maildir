Fine for us developers, but 99.5% of users wouldn't recognise a c 
function if it jumped up and bit them on the ass. If it doesn't say 
"linux supported" on the box, they won't buy it. Google? Source Forge? 
./configure? WTFIT?. Where is their freedom?
Until the manufacturers start providing good quality supported drivers 
for their hardware, binary or source, linux will stay exactly where it 
is now; a server room tool and a hobbyists playground.
I for one think thats a real shame
