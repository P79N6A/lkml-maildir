I did a $(git-repack -a -d && git-prune-packed) before trying the bisect.  
Wow.  Talk about a speed improvement.
I also found that $(make oldconfig; make kernelrelease) was enough to
bisect down to the commit in question.
The final git bisect bad reported:

That means that $(make kernelrelease) sets dot_config := 0.
And since the block:
,---- linux-2.6/Makefile lines 571-574
| ifdef CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO
|         localversion-auto := $(shell $(PERL) $(srctree)/scripts/setlocalversion $(srctree))
|         LOCALVERSION := $(LOCALVERSION)$(localversion-auto)
| endif
`----
is in the ifeq ($(dot-config),1) section, localversion-auto does not
get set anymore when the target is kernelrelease.
Which really makes kernelrelease useless.
I understand why the patch was proposed and included.
But the kernelrelease is really .config dependant, given the
CONFIG_LOCALVERSION and CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO options.
Unless it is OK to force a defconfig when kernelrelease is called on
an unconfigured tree?
Whatever the solution, it is commit ac4d5f74a9b243d9f3f123fe5ce609478df208d8
that breaks $(make kernelrelease).
