Learn to read.  You don't _have_ to have initrd.  At all.  There's nothing
to stop your loader from putting whatever cpio archive it likes - it
doesn't involve anything other than slapping files you want together
putting their owner/group/size/timestamps/mode/name before each of them.
Anything that puts a bunch of modules in core will have to do equivalent
job.
