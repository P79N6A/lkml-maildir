How so? F00F bug only works on Pentium or have I got this /completely/
wrong ???

Can you provide an example of these failures ?
I tried quite a lot of combinations after making the changes.

The DLink card is more expensive than a RealTek for some reason.
If I paid over the odds for something, I'd want to know what it

but they did suggest that they were not the same.
