It's not verboten but left undefined.
	The vfork() function has the same effect as fork(), except
	that the behaviour is undefined if the process created by
	vfork() either modifies any data other than a variable of type
	pid_t used to store the return value from vfork(), or returns
	from the function in which vfork() was called, or calls any other
	function before successfully calling _exit() or one of the
	exec family of functions.
