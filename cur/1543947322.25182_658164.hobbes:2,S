Because the new driver works, if you just set it up right.
Until now every "breakage" was just a usage error.

b43 supports s2ram and s2disk.

No. Playing with kconfig SELECT is really _nothing_ for a -stable
series. I am _not_ going to be responsible for any
breakages. And using SELECT _does_ break things. We had dozens of bugs
until all the damn dependencies were right. Even "Obviously Correct (tm)"
changes to SELECT _do_ break on weird configurations.
See the bcm43xx mail archives for examples.
If you need that patch for some reason, please apply it locally.
The problem will automatically get fixed when bcm43xx goes away, soon.

It is not my problem, if you refuse to use b43.
You also still refuse to tell me details about your card and _what_
does not work. I do own lots of different card and they
all work fine with b43. There's one exception, the 4311 rev 3 (or something,
don't quite remember). But patches are available and will ship in 2.6.25.
bcm43xx won't get removed until that shipped.
