Rainer Weikusat sent me the following code snippet:
-----
#!/bin/bash
#
# From: Rainer Weikusat <rw@another.de>
cd /tmp
echo -e "#!/bin/sh\necho f1" >f1
echo -e "#!/bin/sh\necho f2" >f2
chmod +x f1 f2
ln -sf f1 f3
exec 3<f3
ln -sf f2 f3
/proc/self/fd/3
-----
which prints "f1". This reminded me of the fact that in Linux
all filedescriptors have in fact names in the /proc directory,
which kind of turns my original argument around: Since all fds
have names, you can actually use the regular system calls to
access them and are not required to use the f-calls instead. In
his Example, Rainer demonstrates this by emulating the
nonexistent fexecve() with a regular execve() on file descriptor 3.
This probably differs from a hypothetical fexecve() system call
in the point in time when the permissions are check, but should
be sufficient from a security standpoint in most cases. In
particular, Apaches suexec.c should be perfectly happy for it.
All that _I_ need now to be happy is an option to execve() that
makes execve() ignore any potential SUID bits on a program. I
went through great pains and troubles to change to the desired
UID in my program and to check the validity of the program I
want to execute and I do not want that program to change
privileges spontaneously...
