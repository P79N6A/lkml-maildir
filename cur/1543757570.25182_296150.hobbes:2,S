What you're doing is forcing the execution of allocate_resource (&ioport... );
Cause adding the printk you're adding it's changing this:
else 
 ret = allocate_resource(...);
up(...);
by this:
else
 printk(...);
/*This is not executing inside the else clause no more,
 *so doesn't matter if s->cb_dev it's true or not, you're going with this*/
ret = allocate_resource(...); 
up(...);
You're changing the block inside the else clause.
It's not about upsetting the sem afaik.
I could be wrong though, and that'll be a terrible tragedy.
Of course this is as long as CONFIG_PCI it's evaluating true, is it?
Vicente.
