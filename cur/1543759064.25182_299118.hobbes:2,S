To close this issue out of the LKML and alsa-devel, a bug report has been 
written.
It appears to be an issue with the 'headphone jack sense' (as kde labels 
it).  The issue is in the way the 8x0 addresses the docking station/port 
replicator's audio output jack.  The mentioned quick fix does not work for 
using the ds/pr audio output, but does resolve it for a user that is only 
using headphones/internal speakers.
