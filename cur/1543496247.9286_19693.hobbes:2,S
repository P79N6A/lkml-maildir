What about heuristic which says
	if (...) {
		...
		return;
	}
should be moved out of line?

maybe 
#define unlikely __builtin_one_unlikely()
if (is_error() && unlikely) {
}
:-). Where unlikely is evaluated as 1, but gcc knows that unlikely is
not evaluated in common case. It would permit other nice tricks, like
(dreaming)
if (unlikely) {
	...
}
which means code in brackets hardly ever executes, so optimize it for
size, instead ;-).
