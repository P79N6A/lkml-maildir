It works with up to date stuffs. That is my latest 2.6 tree with
radeonfb and XFree from CVS. Part of the problem is that the firmware
sets up a tiled display. I updated my radeonfb to "clear" the
various SURFACE_* translation registers (among other fixes).

Yup. I need to figure that out. It's possible that it does like a G5,
that is boot full speed when you auto-boot and low speed when you boot
via OF user interface. There may be need for some thermal control as
well.

The "N" thing is normal. Apple hacked so that only DHCP servers which
know about some special Apple extensions can be used when doing that.
The easy work around is to use the syntax:
enet:x.x.x.x,file
where x.x.x.x is the IP address of the TFTP server and file is the
filename. With that in boot-device (or typing boot enet: etc....),
the machine will obtain it's local IP from any DHCP or BOOTP server and
will then TFTP from the specified host.
