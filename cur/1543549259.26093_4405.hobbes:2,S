Hi all!!
I just compiled 2.4.0-test9-pre4 and get the following error in my 
syslog:
Warning - Running really short on DMA buffers. I dont have any 
ISA-devices installed and no device is in /proc/dma. I always thought 
that DMA buffers are only for "old" DMA on ISA bus ...
The system runs stable (so far ...)
Any idea??
Cheers Markus
