ok. I suppose it can be done as an option. If required, access from host 
system can be allowed. If "secure" environment is requested - fully 
isolated.

Yes, but nesting can be one level as in OpenVZ, when VPS is a nested 
namespace inside host system or it can be a fully isolated separate 
traditional namespace.
By real nesting I mean hierarchical containers, when containers inside 
multiple containers are allowed. This is hard to implement. For example, 
for real containers you will need to have isolated TCP/IP stacks and 
with complex rules of routing etc.

You can use fully isolated containers like OpenVZ VPSs for this. They 
are naturally suitable for this, because provide you not PIDs isolation 
only, but also IPC, sockets, etc.
How can you migrate application which consists of two processes doing 
IPC via signals? They are not tired inside kernel anyhow and there is no 
way to automatically detect that both should be migrated together.
VPSs what provides you such kind of boundaries of what should be 
considered as a whole.

If I understand you correctly it is fully insecure way of doing things. 
After changing context without applying all the restrictions which 
should be implied by VPS your process will be ptrace'able and so on.

Debugging - yes, in production - no.
That is why OpenVZ allows host system to access VPS resources - for 
debugging in production.

Thanks a lot for valuable discussion and your time!
