Well, IMO you should never have "current:mW" in any form whatsoever  
anyways.  Electrically it makes no sense; it's like saying  
"height:grams".  Watts are an indication of power emitted or consumed  
per unit time (as opposed to current/amperage which counts only the  
number of electrons and not the change in energy), so perhaps  
"power_flow:mW" or "power_consumption:mW" would make more sense?
I can conceivably see a need for a "current:mJ_per_s" versus  
"current:mW" depending on the hardware-reported units, but never both  
at the same time.
Cheers,
