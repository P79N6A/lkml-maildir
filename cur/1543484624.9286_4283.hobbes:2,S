Or, if you've already got a script file that does multiple rules
to set up your system, use ipfwadm-wrapper instead of ipfwadm.
I put a bit of code at the beginning of my old script that does this:
====
#!/bin/bash
if [ "`(uname -r | cut -d. -f2)`" = "0" ]
  then
    echo "using ipfwadm"
    IPFWADM=ipfwadm
  else
    echo "using ipfwadm-wrapper for ipchains"
    IPFWADM=/sbin/ipfwadm-wrapper
  fi
====
and changed (sed rules!) all the ipfwadm invocations to $IPFWADM :
====
# loopback interface
$IPFWADM -I -a accept -S 0.0.0.0/0 -D 127.0.0.1/32 -W lo
====
I did that back when I was trying out new kernels and might be
booting up either a new one or the old reliable 2.0.something.
