To clarify. `Scrollback' here is *useful* scrollback during early boot
and OOPs (which is absent, AFAIK), "nothing like that" is coloring of the
messages by loglevel.

Coloring isn't useful. If it was, it would be implemented ~16 years ago.

This `scrollback' is usual late boot / console one. If fact useful,
until first tty switch or if `screen` cannot be used. But for some
reason if scrolling region (DECSTBM) is less than whole screen, nothing
works. And if width set to odd number of columns
`stty columns $((80-1))`
whole output becomes somewhat funny.

The kernel developer talks about what is important to him. This is not
technical point.

Because without userspace kernel panics. And if something is broken very
early, then time to do kernel development better (not to break working
early booting stuff for everybody), rather than to talk about importance
of the color. I think, same applies to kernel debugger, that still
is not in mainline (AFAIK).

Not control, but flexible coloring (any kind of highlighting), selecting
of useful information, i.e. making output more user friendly. This are
things, which all *users* (not developers) expect in boot process of the
one's _machine_, as opposed to debugging (early boot) kernel bugs.

I'm not sure what kind of printing it is. I do not use X much, but when i
did, i recall MCE messages in xterm, when over-clocked CPU was going
crazy, though.

But what about (NAK && ! any_important_kernel_developer_name)?

Quick is not for me (i did accepted "config NO" size reduction review,
btw), but for those, who reads LKML or looks on archive search results.
I just am amazed how `Subject' is miss-used. I personally like to have
most of the interesting information gathered from all that thousands of
(not only LKML) messages. But a thread with all-like-one subjects,
subjects that for some reason are taking place on the screen of
MUAs (empty space if they are the same). Thus, short (easy to get right)
summary in subject is more that welcome by me.

That was a review of the implementation, an opinion on whole idea. Idea
of yet another ugly kernel functionality, just because *BSD kernels have
one.
I like highlighting, i like to make it very flexible, nice and
interesting[0]. This is possible only in the userspace, right after first
process ran from initramfs. This happens very quickly usually. And yes,
this is not acceptable/available for kernel developers/maintainers.
