I looked at optimizing the per-cpu data accessors on PowerPC and only
ever saw fractions of a percent change in overall performance, which
says to me that we don't actually use per-cpu data all that much.  So
unless you make per-cpu data really really slow, I doubt that we'll
see any significant performance difference.
