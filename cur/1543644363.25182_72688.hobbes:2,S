Just want to be clear that we are going to a per-CPU buffer scheme.
However, for sake of argument, the above is still not true.  A global lock
has a different (worse) performance problem then the lock-free atomic
operation even given a global queue.  The difference is 1) the Linux global
lock is very expensive and interacts with potential other processes, and 2)
you have to hold the lock for the entire duration of logging the event;
with the atomic operation you are finished once you've reserved you space.
If you didn't use the expensive Linux global lock and just a global lock,
you could be interrupted in the middle of holding the lock and performance
would fall off the map.
