Directory from a Linux running pure 2.2.1 on a UP Pentium is exported
to SUNs running Solaris 2.5.1.  After a few days of normal work,
`ld' run on Solaris in exported directory started segfaulting.  At
the same time, there are messages on Linux:
Feb  1 18:59:47 ariel kernel: nfsd: RC_REPLSTAT/reply len 33!
Feb  1 18:59:48 ariel kernel: nfsd: RC_REPLSTAT/reply len 40!
Feb  1 18:59:51 ariel kernel: nfsd Security: export/home bad export.
Feb  1 19:00:08 ariel kernel: nfsd: RC_REPLSTAT/reply len 59!
Feb  1 19:00:09 ariel kernel: nfsd Security: export/home bad export.
Otherwise, NFS seems to work: directories are mounted and unmounted,
I can see directory listings, read and write files without a problem.
Any ideas, anyone?  I will provide more information/do experimenting
upon request.
Eugene
