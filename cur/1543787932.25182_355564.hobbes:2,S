That's the functionality I have in mind, the problem is finding the 
model and serial number info for all the various types. In some "really 
works" plug and play world there would be software to generate something 
like the UUID, and a nice table of what to call it. That doesn't quite 
seem to be the case yet, and it makes life a bit dificult if you need 
raw partitions on plugable devices.
Not impossible, but PITA right now. Anyone looking for a topic for their 
thesis? ;-)
