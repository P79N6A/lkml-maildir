      Hello, Adam, Greg and other.
As I think in this section of kernel it's not necessarily to use
__devinit and __devexit.
Soundcards(and other devices) can't be HotPlug as I know.
And if we look at #define of this attributes, then we see that
it useless with not HotPlug devices.
180 #ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG
181 #define __devinit
182 #define __devinitdata
183 #define __devexit
184 #define __devexitdata
185 #else
186 #define __devinit __init
187 #define __devinitdata __initdata
188 #define __devexit __exit
189 #define __devexitdata __exitdata
190 #endif
And with changes from __init to __devinit and enabled CONFIG_HOTPLUG
we loose advantage of __init.
May be I've missed something?
       Best regards, Ruslan.
