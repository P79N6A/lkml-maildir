There is an important issue that you seem to be missing.
You say
  "on the exporting machine we don't have these garantee either"
However, that is not the case.  On the exporting machine, you may
choose to use the "fsync" call to get a guarantee.  However the NFSv2
protocol does not have any equivalent to the "fsync" call. So if you
export your filesystems with the "async" flag, then when clients call
"fsync", they don't really get the guarantee that they expect.
NFSv3 does have an equivalent of "fsync" - it is spelt "COMMIT".
So with NFSv2, you have two options: safe or fast.  I choose "safe".
