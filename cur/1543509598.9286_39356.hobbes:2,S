I'm curious if anybody could tell me the reasoning behind fs/smbfs/sock.c
having the following set:
#define SMBFS_PARANOIA 1
I tried out samba to connect to an OS/2 server we have here at work and it
seemed to work fine.  But, while working fine, the console and the log get
inundated with messages like:
Sep 15 19:59:01 tpserv kernel: smb_receive_trans2: copied, parm=4079 of
4079, data=220 of 4079
Sep 15 19:59:01 tpserv kernel: smb_receive_trans2: copied, parm=4079 of
4079, data=4079 of 4079
Given the code in that file I'd think a quick recompile with
SMBFS_PARANOIA not set would fix the messages coming to the
log/console...my question is, by doing this am I just fixing a symptom and
ignoring a problem?
The messages seem to come up anytime there is any traffic with the OS/2
server...I haven't sniffed the connection to see if it's happening for all
packets or just some.
FYI, I'm using kernel 2.2.12, samba 2.0.5a-1 on a RedHat 6.0 install and
the network driver is the ibmtr (tropic/isa driver)...I can send further
specifics or perform any tests upon request.
