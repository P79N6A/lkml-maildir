I don't see why having an irq_bc wouldn't solve this. At the start of
the interrupt handler, set current->exec_bc to &irq_bc; at the end set
it to current->real_bc; use the cmpxchg() that I suggested to ensure
that you never update task->exec_bc from another task if it's not
equal to task->real_bc; use RCU to ensure that a beancounter is never
freed while someone might be accessing it.

That could work too.
