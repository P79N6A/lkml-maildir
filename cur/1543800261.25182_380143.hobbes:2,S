Point well made. Dan Lyons at Forbes suggested when you are stalked, the 
best course of
action is to expose them. I have noticed a complete cessation of hate 
mail since it went up.
Instead of getting dozens of hate mails, now I get none. I'll take it 
down when it stops
altogether. I have no idea have these people got the impression I am 
anti-Linux. I am as much
a member of the community as anyone else, and I plan to keep working on 
Linux (and other
projects) for a long time to come.
