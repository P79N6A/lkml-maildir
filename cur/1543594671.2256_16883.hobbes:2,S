True. Balancing with what Larry said, threads require education. In good
Unix tradition you can shoot yourself in the foot in many ways.

Reproducability is very important. But where threads may become inefficient
if used unwisely (I handily do many megabits of DNS traffic with our
threaded daemon by the way), statemachines have a way if becoming very
intractable - leading to whole new problems.
It's an 'enough rope' thing. Bad programmers will always write broken code -
the saving grace of state machines are that they are hard to write, which
means that *if* they are being used, it is often by a skilled programmer.
