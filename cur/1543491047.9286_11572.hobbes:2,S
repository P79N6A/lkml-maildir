Seriously, folks, this topic has been beaten to death both
here and other places more times than I care to remember.
To put it bluntly, you are wasting everybody's time.
Taking the "Lignux" thread to linux-kernel is simple noise
pollution of the kind that might force the kernel development
to towards a less open model. Now we don't want that, do we?
