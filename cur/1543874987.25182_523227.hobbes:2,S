Subject: [PATCH][2/2] double stack limit (rfc)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Now, ia64's hard-stack-size (rlimit.max) is sum of register-stack size and
memory-stack size. But soft-stack-size (rlimit.cur) accounitng is not sum..
they are accounted independently. This is inconsistent.
I hear some people says that "When I set stack-size-limit to 32M,
I want to use 32M of memory stack..." and register-stack expansion can
fail because stack is used up by memory-stack.
This patch moves register-stack's base address to lower address.
By this patch, meaning of hard-stack-size can be equal to soft-stack-size and
we can avoid the case "register-backing store cannot be expanded because the
memory stack uses the whole stack".
How about this ?
