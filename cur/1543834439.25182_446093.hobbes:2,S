That sounds almost like gcc, only worse.
I think there is something of a problem currently, tough.  It is
getting too hard to get code in if you're not a maintainer for an
existing subsystem (reiser4, suspend2...), and too easy when you're a
maintainer (ext4, uswsusp...).  Ext patches don't get reviewed much
outside of the developpers, and they go in pretty much without
discussion in any case, except when Linus blows a fuse.  Reiser4 would
have be in without discussion if it had been a set of patches through
time to reiser3, and would have been called 4 only when Linus yelled.
I suspect some balancing would be useful.
  OG.
