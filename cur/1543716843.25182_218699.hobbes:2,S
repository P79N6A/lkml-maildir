Should ioctl32 handlers in drivers really call sys_ioctl?  Calling sys_ioctl
makes sense for ioctls that are supported by a broad range of drivers, but
in that case the ioctl32 translation should be in the core compat code.
Drivers using register_ioctl32_conversion should rather call their own
ioctl handlers directly if you ask me.
Do you have a list of drivers currently needing sys_ioctl?
