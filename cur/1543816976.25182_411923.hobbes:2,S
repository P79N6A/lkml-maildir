1) What are the consequences of doing
	if (f_op->splice_write)
		f_op->splice_write(...);
	else
		generic_file_splice_write(...);
to cause sys_splice() to default to supported?
2) Do you really have to test f_op itself for NULL?  Is that a stealth 
closed-file check or something?  I would be surprised if f_op was ever 
really NULL.
