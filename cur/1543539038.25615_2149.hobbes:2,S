The quote was not mine. It was Victor's response to my point
about gcc inline syntax.
C99 is C. It was adopted a few weeks ago. I suspect that gcc
will get the new inline behavior early in their
implementation. I have no idea when that will be.
All assertions about C++ in the kernel are irrefutable. The
headers prevent their being tested.
