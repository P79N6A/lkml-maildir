Subject: [PATCH] (2/4) discontigmem support for i386 against 2.4.20pre3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch restructures mem_init() for i386 to make it easier to
include the i386 numa changes (for CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM) I've been 
working on.  A version of this patch is the in 2.4 aa tree.
The main thing patch does is moves the code from mem_init() that 
sets the max_mapnr and counts up and initializes the highpages, 
and counts free pages into seperate functions.  So that I can 
redefine the functions in my discontigmem patch.  Also, the code 
in paging_init() that figures out the size of the zones and calls 
free_area_init() is pulled into a separate function 
(zone_sizes_init() - this function exists in 2.5 and was written 
by someone other than me :-) so that I can redefine this function 
in the discontig case.
This patch does not depend on the other patches I'm submitting today, but 
my discontigmem patch does depend on this one.
I've tested this patch on the following configurations: UP, SMP, SMP PAE, 
multiquad, multiquad PAE.
Any and all feedback regarding this patch is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Pat
