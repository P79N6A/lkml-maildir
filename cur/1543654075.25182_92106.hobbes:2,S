I got past the not-boot (need to set root=/dev/ide/host0 .... instead 
of /dev/hda10). Wasn't a reiserfs issue after all.
But - ran into the same keyboard and mouse not responding in X that has
plagued me in all the 2.5.4x kernels (and recent 2.4.20-xxx)
APIC on/off doesn't help.
ACPI on/off doesn't help.
