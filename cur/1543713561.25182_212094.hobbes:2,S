Yes, which is why I'm such a fan.

Well, you'd do presumably:
	cpus_or(&s, &d1, &d2);
And make cpus_or() an inline so you get typechecking.
But my rough grepping reveals that there are around 420 uses of all the
cpu macros throughout the kernel.  But if you merely implement:
	any_online_cpu
	cpumask_of_cpu
	cpu_isset
	cpu_set
	cpu_clear
You'll have covered about 300 of them.  I don't think a complete
abstraction is actually required or desirable: if someone wants to do
something tricky (like anding, oring, etc), there's nothing wrong with
accessing cpu.bits.
Thanks!
Rusty.
