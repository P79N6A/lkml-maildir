No, sorry. Nearly always it lock up so hard that even sysrq didn't work
anymore. Most times the console was blanked. If not, there was a line
with "do_irq" or something like that (if i remember correctly).
A few times it continuous oopsing (scrolling like mad).
I think it's just a stack overflow. Knowing that XFS + long IO stack
have problems with 4k stacks. And i have zero crashes with the
recompiled 8k stack kernels. (All kernel are the fedora ones).
Btw: In the past the server runs on slightly different hardware and
without raid1 (NFS -> XFS -> DM -> IDE disk). It runs with 4k stacks. I
had a few crashes, but i blame the hardware for it.
I don't want to make tests with the server. It's my main data storage
and i don't want to risk it.

Sorry, i don't think i can do this. My other computer, which i can use
for tests, is x86_64 based.
And IFAIK the problem on the XFS side has something to do with looking
for freespace on many AGs. So maybe a bigger and filled filesystem is
needed. And 50GB ram disks are out of question.
