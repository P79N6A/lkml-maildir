Subject: [PATCH] [errata] locked page handling in shrink_cache
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

please ignore previous patch ...
----
Whenever the shrink_cache wakes up after a laundered page in unlocked, it should
move that page to the end of inactive list so that
the page can be freed immediately and shrink_cache dosen't have to wait for
complete list scan before freeing this page.
The patch is created against standard redhat 7.1 distribution 2.4.16 kernel.
Let me know if I need to create it for a different kernel release.
regards
Amol
