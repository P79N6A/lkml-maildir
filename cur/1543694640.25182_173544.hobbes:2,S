I came across two different ones early in the boot process while chasing 
down another bug.  They seem to be fairly benign, but someone may want to
track this down:
    dmesg:    
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=1091
    .config:  
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=1092
Don't worry about anything past CPU initialization, it's persumably 
unrelated.  I hope someone finds this helpful.  Please let me know if 
you would like additional information.
