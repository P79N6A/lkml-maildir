Hi Al,
> What was your binutils version (# ld -v) before and after the upgrade?
I was on the "last" version of binutils that Red Hat 9 had, which was:
binutils-2.13.90.0.18-9.i386 
I went up to the prebuilt version of binutils from Fedora Core 3:
[root@scottk7 tmp]# ld -v
GNU ld version 2.15.92.0.2 20040927
[root@scottk7 tmp]# rpm -qa|grep binutil
binutils-2.15.92.0.2-5.1
