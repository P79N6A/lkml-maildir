it still has an effect: if PREEMPT_BKL is disabled it drops the BKL. But 
if PREEMPT_BKL is enabled too then cond_resched() has no effect. 
(cond_resched_locked() does though)
back to the problem reported by Lee:

hm, where does the latency come from? We do have a lockbreaker in 
unmap_vmas():
                        if (need_resched() ||
                                (i_mmap_lock && need_lockbreak(i_mmap_lock))) {
                                if (i_mmap_lock) {
                                        *tlbp = NULL;
                                        goto out;
                                }
                                cond_resched();
                        }
why doesnt this break up the 28ms latency?
