Lovely. You've completely sidestepped the main part:
	*threads* *are* *hard* *to* *write* *correctly*
Average programmer will fuck up and miss tons of race conditions. Better
than average programmers do. If you've got shared resource - you are in
for problems. Threads are useful. But they take more efforts and are much
harder to debug _and_ to prove correctness. In other words, that's one of
the last resort tools, not the first one. If you can do it without shared
state - don't bother with threads. Same as with rewrite in assmebler - do
it with small critical parts and don't unless you absolutely have to. The
first rule of optimisation: don't. Keep the critical sections small and if
you can avoid them - it's worth the efforts. You'll win a lot when it will
come to changing the thing. And you will have to change it, sooner or
later. Same goes for debugging. Non-threaded code is easier to understand.
Yes, you may be very clever. But you'll have to debug it on Friday evening
after a hard week when you want only one thing - go home and sleep. Or
somebody else will and he will curse you. KISS. And threads are _not_
simple.
