Using kdoc style for new code is nice.

Minor rant: extern is always redundant for function prototypes in C.
I'd prefer that we adopt a standard of not using extern for functions,
as it would make use of extern for variables (almost always
inappropriate, especially in C files) stick out more.
While people claim this has some documentation value ("I _meant_ for
this to be exported"), I think it actually has a net negative effect,
as quite a number of people actually think the "extern" keyword does
some unspecified magic here and ignore the namespace pollution of their
theoretically "un-externed" but not explicitly static functions.
There isn't any sort of consensus on this point as far as I know, so
this is just me venting.

Suspicious use of volatile - writel is doing the actual write, this
function never does a dereference. As you've already got private
copies of the pointers already in s and d, it's perfectily reasonable
and idiomatic to do:
	while (--count >= 0)
		__raw_writel(*s++, d++);
I'd personally write this as:
	while (count--)
		__raw_writel(*s++, d++);
And as you appear to be using the __raw.. version to avoid repeated
mb()s, you probably ought to tack one on at the end.
