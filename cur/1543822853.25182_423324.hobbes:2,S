Datapoint:
Linux fileserver 2.6.15.6 #1 PREEMPT Wed Mar 8 20:26:55 EST 2006
x86_64 GNU/Linux
CONFIG_MD_RAID5=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_DM=y
CONFIG_DM_SNAPSHOT=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES_X86_64=y
encrypted logical volume on a raid-5 MD on 4 SATA drives, mounted reiser3.

It's worked through multiple kernels, and moving from 32 to 64bits.
2.6.11 (64-bit) 2.6.10 (64bit) 2.6.8 (32bit) is the kernel history I
have so far.  I'm not sure when I switched from cryptoloop to dm-crypt
though, at least before may '05.
I'm not running dm-crypt directly on MD, though, the stack is
SATA->MD->DM->DM-crypt->reiser3.   That may be the difference.
I've got plenty of free space, I could make a ~75gb encrypted
partition and run any sort
of write pattern test/filesystem you want me to try.
