 My mailer is tolerant of those characters.  However, they
 are gibberish given my current character set.  I've replaced
 them with "." to prevent their further propagation.
 My inability to "read" those characters is not my MUAs fault.

 Agreed.

 I believe that Linus has specified that the kernel code, comments
 and primary documentation will be in English.  Since his native
 languages are Swedish and Finnish (IIRC) I'd hardly consider this
 to have been a "racist" choice.  
 Presumably Linus chose English from among his adopted languages,
 for practical reasons.  Perhaps he felt that the Linux kernel was
 best served by choosing one language and he decided that English
 would make it available to the broadest possible audience.  Perhaps
 he felt that the use of English would like garner the broadest
 contribution by other developers.  Perhaps he just preferred to
 avoid the congnitive disonance that would result from a mixture of
 English derived keywords (particularly those that are defined and
 reserved by C) with identifiers and comments in other language.
 Regardless of his reasons, he chose English.  It is a reasonable
 choice.
 It is my understanding that this mailing list is conducted in
 English by the consensus of its participants.  Since the kernel is
 in English (C with English derived identifiers) it is logical that
 the mailing list and most other "official" business of the kernel
 developers team would follow suit.
 There are other customs on this mailing list which follow common
 conventions of traditional UNIX and related technical mailing lists
 and newsgroups.  Those discourage the use of character sets other
 than 7-bit ASCII and encourage line lengths of ~ 72 characters or
 less.  They also discourage "sigs" of more than ~4 lines, etc.
 There are some other customs and guidelines to this list; though
 none are formalized.
 To claim that this "verges on racism" is essentially to mandate
 the curse of Babel.  It's impractical.

 Clearly the correspondent here is unwilling to bow to 
 the traditions and conventions of this list.  Using 
 character sets beyond the 7-bit clean ASCII, English, and
 keeping line length at less than 72 columns.
 It may be an artifact of imperialism and "obsolete" technologies
 but the 7-bit ASCII and accommodation for 80 column terminal 
 widths are the customs of this (and most traditional UNIX/Linux
 and related) mailing lists and newsgroups.

 I don't think that the choice of English has alienated any 
 significant number of developers.  The fact is that Linux is 
 very widespread in Japan and throughout asia.  (FreeBSD used
 to have a bit of an edge in Japan; I think it's "marketshare"
 has declined vs. Linux' over the last two years, though both
 are growing much faster than any other OS in that market).
 lkml is not here to cater to 'international developers.'  It
 exists to serve Linux kernel developers.  Since Linux has 
 standardized on English/C it implies a requirement that 
 "international developers" (such as Linus, Alan Cox, 
 Alexey Kuznetsov etc) be tolerant of English.
 Perusing the CREDITS files should convince anyone that
 Linux has not "alienated" international developers.  Linux
 probably has a broader base of support, from a larger range
 of countries, than any other software project in history.

 I was happy to see that GTK+ has recently released an upgrade
 with BiDi (bi-directional I18N) support and that Linux now
 support Arabic.  Presumably Hebrew and other BiDi languages
 will be added in the near future.  This support should eventually
 permeate the GNOME apps.
 However, that is all in user space.  As far as I know there
 has been no need to modify the kernel to support its 
 I18N (other than support for Unicode in filenames?)
 What other kernel related I18N problems are we facing on 
 the path to "world domination?"  I have no idea how one
 would encode BiDi into filenames (for example).  
 On the other hand, has anyone here read Bruce Schneier's 
 (author of _Applied_Cryptography_, founder of Counterpane systems)
 recent comments on the security implications of Unicode's
 complexity.  
 Essentially he says that Unicode is sufficiently complex that 
 software supporting it cannot be auditing for security robustness
 to any reasonable degree of confidence.  
    Conspiracy nuts might find correlation between the co-incidence
    of that comment and this topic here.  A Microsoft-product-using
    correspondent advocating the adoption of I18N support on a core
    Linux mailing list and in the Linux kernel in general ;).
