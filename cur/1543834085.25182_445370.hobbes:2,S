Yes, all kernel modules have full reign on the system so they can overwrite
memory not related to them at all. The nVidia could have overwritten some
piece of reiserfs's memory and continued on it's own merry way leaving
reiserfs to panic the next time it looked there. Personally, I use the
nVidia driver all the time and have never had a problem so it's probably
not the culprit, but the only way to be sure is to repeat the problem
without it ever having been loaded. Booting up and rmmod'ing the module
isn't good enough, it has to be a 100% clean boot.
Jim.
