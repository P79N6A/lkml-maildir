I think we all would be better off not wasting our time with this...

Assume you wanted, for some reason, have a userspace application have access
to the nvram.  You want it to store 50/114 bytes there that you don't have to
care about saving otherwise and can restore after a boot.  You do not want
this application to be able to generate 8192 interrupts per second and mess
up some real-time processes timing.
a) do you want to auto-detect the NVRAM's size ? To make real use of it, you
have to get along with the BIOS anyway and then you should know the size of
the NVRAM. 
b) if you can write the nvram, the whole test should not be difficult and does
not require long delays. I don't think we want to generally want to do that as
it is a real bad place for a system crash to occur.
