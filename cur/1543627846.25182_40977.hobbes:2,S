Thanks Ingo,
That has balanced the timer irqs.  I've also enabled hyper threading
(append="acpismp=force").
Here's the output from /proc/interrupts:

And, you've gotta like this line:
Total of 4 processors activated (14299.95 BogoMIPS).
I'm going to do some testing on it to check it's stability.
I'll let you know the results.
Thanks again and regards,
James
