Yes, it disables preemption.
Taking any spinlock will do it too.

on_each_cpu() will call a function on each CPU.  Be careful that the
function is safe in the contexts in which it will be called.
If you just want to force you code to run on one cpu, that is
automatic if you are holding a spinlock (but then you can't schedule,
return to userspace etc.)
In general you can fix a task to a cpu using set_cpus_allowed().
