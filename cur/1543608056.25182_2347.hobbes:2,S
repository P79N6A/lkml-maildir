Dear all,
I am porting my old code to the new kernels 2.4.12 , I find the a couple 
of variables including "freepages" in the kernel space are gone... how 
can I read these values in the kernel space? Also it is missing from 
/proc/sys/vm as well. Is there a new type of VM adopted in Linux? Thanks.
regards,
DC
