Close. Some things:
1. It's rather slow and quite CPU consuming and certainly I/O consuming
   at times - I keep, to try it out, leafnode-2 in a DARCS repo, which
   has a mere 20,000 lines in 140 files, with 1,436 changes so far, on a
   RAID-1 with two 7200/min disk drives, with an Athlon XP 2500+ with
   512 MB RAM. The repo has 1,700 files in 11.5 MB, the source itself
   189 files in 1.8 MB.
   Example: darcs annotate nntpd.c takes 23 s. (2,660 lines, 60 kByte)
   The maintainer himself states that there's still optimization required.
2. It has an impressive set of dependencies around Glasgow Haskell
   Compiler. I don't personally have issues with that, but I can already
   hear the moaning and bitching.
3. DARCS is written in Haskell. This is not a problem either, but I'd
   think there are fewer people who can hack Haskell than people who
   can hack C, C++, Java, Python or similar. It is still better than
   BitKeeper from the hacking POV as the code is available and under an
   acceptable license.
Getting DARCS up to the task would probably require some polishing, and
should probably be discussed with the DARCS maintainer before making
this decision.
Don't get me wrong, DARCS looks promising, but I'm not convinced it's
ready for the linux kernel yet.
