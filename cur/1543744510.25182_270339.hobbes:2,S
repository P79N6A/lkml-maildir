Subject: [PATCH] Add pci_save_state() to ALSA

Hi
Some time ago, a patch was merged that removed pci_save_state() and
pci_restore_state() from various drivers. That patch also added
pci_restore_state() to sound/core/init.c but didn't add pci_save_state()
anywhere.
My laptop doesn't resume (gets what I assume is an ACPI timeout and
hangs solid) without this small obvious patch.
