I just tried it and I get the same I/O error. I made sure the share was
mounted 'd /smbfs/tek-prod', rebooted the NT, and then (when the NT was
up again):
cola:/smbfs>d tek-prod
ls: tek-prod: Input/output error
Maybe this is what happened to me last time as well, although I can't find
anything about a reboot in NTs "Event Viewer" (it does say something when
it is rebooted, right?)
Michael, if you are keeping track of who reported what, you can probably
remove mine since it looks unrelated to what the others have seen.
