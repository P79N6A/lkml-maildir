Dave,
	i meant no personal affront to yourself or RedHat; i just thought i'd
let you know why myself (and i'm sure many others) don't use your distro 
anymore.  i did label that little comment with a "<rant mode="flame">", now
didn't i? ;)
	BTW, if someone did say we were a bunch of pinheads, i'm sure we would
listen and ask "why?" then try to fix what was making us pinheads, not just
dismiss it by saying, "oh, everyone else is a pinhead too".
