Even if thats the case it has proved to be one of the most stable boards
ABit has ever made. Aside from the ocassional errors from kernel-2.2.33
it still runs perfectly. I think we may be making more out of this than
is what's really wrong. My system for example with 2x400 is currently
running at 2x533 with kernel-2.2.14pre15 and FreeBSD 3.4-STABLE
perfectly. I run 2 SETI@home sessions nightly too. If I do a dmesg with
kernel-2.2.33 I get the error but it still runs fine.
