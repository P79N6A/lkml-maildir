Subject: struct pci_device_id declaration cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This set of patches applies the macro DECLARE_PCI_DEVICE_TABLE to the 
declarations of struct pci_device_id in several network drivers.  The drivers
build cleanly with these patches (without any new warnings) on both x86 and 
PowerPC.
There are ~90 such cleanups in the /drivers/net tree alone (and ~350 in the
kernel overall); these patches are just a subset to avoid flooding the mailing 
list before getting feedback.
These 9 patches can also be pulled from the "net" branch of:
git://www.southpole.se/~jonas/git/linux.git
The remainder of the cleanups will be pushed out to my public tree once I 
know the reaction to this subset.
