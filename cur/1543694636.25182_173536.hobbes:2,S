Sure, I'm sorry. Still I haven't got an oops under test8 but the symptoms
are the same:
o esd is running.
o Run totem. The first time it doesn't hang.
o run totem again. It'll stop in 
  open("/dev/dsp", O_WRONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_LARGEFILE
  So, it seems that esd is blocking the access to /dev/dsp; so I've
  to kill it (very common when you use esd)
o but killall esd hangs too:
open("/proc/570/stat", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 3
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0444, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
old_mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x401d8000
read(3, "570 (gconfd-2) S 1 530 482 1025 "..., 1024) = 192
close(3)                                = 0
munmap(0x401d8000, 4096)                = 0
open("/proc/572/stat", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 3
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0444, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
old_mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x401d8000
read(3, 
and it hangs here
o If you run ps ax, i'll hang too:
stat64("/proc/572", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0555, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
open("/proc/572/stat", O_RDONLY)        = 6
read(6, 
o If you're running gnome; it'll hang because it wants to make noise and it's
  waiting for /dev/dsp to be freed
I wasn't able to get an oops; the one which happened in -wli1 may be unrelated
as wli said; but I'll continue trying to reproduce it.
