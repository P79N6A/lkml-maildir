Doesn't appear to be enough.  I can't figure out why (since it appears
write_cache_pages bubbles up directly to sys_msync), but with that
patch applied, in my test case[1], msync returns -1 EIO.  However,
with the exact same kernel without that patch applied, msync returns
524288 (AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE).  But as your patch specifically flips
524288 to 0, I can't figure out how it eventually returns  -1 EIO.
