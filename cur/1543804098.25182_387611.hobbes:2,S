Ouch, ignore this patch if you haven't already.  The above is
parenthesized wrong.
Matt, what's your opinion on proceeding?  I know you want to get
the DMI stuff in distros.  I'm looking at reworking ioremap to
hide all this stuff, but that'll be a bigger change and may be
harder to get into distro releases.
For upstream, the ioremap rework sounds like the way to go, but
I don't know which the distros would prefer for updates.
