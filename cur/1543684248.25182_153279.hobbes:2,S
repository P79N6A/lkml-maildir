I thought about that. Though, strace shows this is straight after ldso
mapped all libs. So apt-get's main() didn't yet start.
amtus:~/sigill_catcher# cat run.sh 
#!/bin/sh
LD_PRELOAD=./libsigill.so apt-get update
amtus:~/sigill_catcher# strace -o xxx -f -ff ./run.sh 
Process 681 attached (waiting for parent)
Process 681 resumed (parent 680 ready)
Process 680 suspended
Process 680 resumed
Process 681 detached
./run.sh: line 3:   681 Illegal instruction LD_PRELOAD=./libsigill.so apt-get update
amtus:~/sigill_catcher# grep -i sig xx* | grep -i ILL
xxx:stat64("/root/sigill_catcher", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0
xxx:wait4(-1, [WIFSIGNALED(s) && WTERMSIG(s) == SIGILL], 0, NULL) = 681
xxx.681:open("./libsigill.so", O_RDONLY)        = 3
xxx.681:getcwd("/root/sigill_catcher", 128)     = 21
xxx.681:--- SIGILL (Illegal instruction) @ 0 (0) ---
So my lib gets loaded, but it's _init() function seems to be called too
late (in prior, some parts of libstdc++5 decided to commit suicide).
Looking at the strace, libsigill is the loaded as the very first action.
Then, all the other libs are mapped. It seems that _init()ing them
happens somewhat in reverse order or something like that... I'm a but
hosed in that case:)
