Hi,
i've just downloaded iproute2-2.4.7-now-ss010824.tar.gz.
But the 'ip' utility from the archive doesn't work with
my 2.4.17-pre6. Netlink is compiled in (no emulation device),
and opening the socket succeeds. But all requests (sendto's
in libnetlink) to the driver get ECONNREFUSED.
I tried 'ip link show'.
Did i got an incorrect tarball or the thing is really broken?
Btw where the contemporary iproute2 package can be found?
