Problem description:
 
1.  kernel compiled w/o FB support.  When attempting to switch
    back to X from VC1-6 system locks hard for SMP.  Nada thing
    fixes this except hard reset... no Alt-SysRq-B, nothing
    DRI not enabled.  Video card has r128 chipset.
 
2.  System is a NFS root machine, after a period of heavy ntwk
    activity, eg. "make clean" in /usr/src/linux ETH0 no longer
    works or sometimes just ntwk activity during system boot is
    enough to cause the ETH activity to cease.
    The only recourse is to Alt-SysRq-B the system.
    NIC = NE2K ISA
 
3. Enabling PIIX4, kernel locks hard when printing the partition
   tables for hdc.   hdc has no partitions.
   I think this problem is on Ted's problem list???
 
4. ISAPNP assigns an invalid/unusable IRQ to NE2K NIC card.
   Previously reported to Linux & Ingo, they asked for an MPTABLE
   dump, haven't heard back since providing said data.
