Reminds me that the Alpha implementation of get_wchan() looks to me like
it doesn't handle all cases of schedule() being called from another
scheduler function correctly.  Some Alpha guru may want to take a look at
it.
I recently had to fix the mips / mips64 versions of get_wchan() - for the
dozenth time.  I'd really like to see a wchan field in task_struct to avoid
get_wchan breaking every once in a while.  Current implementation more than
qualifies as a crazy hack ...
