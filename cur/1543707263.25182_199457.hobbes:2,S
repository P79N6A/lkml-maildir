Sorry, I didn't want to confuse you.
I`ve attached a USB mouse because the PS/2 trackball didn`t work when I was 
creating the /proc-output (since I booted without the i????.nomux option). 
But I don`t like the USB mouse, I prefer to use the trackball.
The problem is the same: The USB mouse can be attachend/detached any time. It 
does hotplug very well. All data I've send you was with the USB mouse 
detached. Only when I did the cat /proc/... I didn't want to use the trackpad 
and attached the USB mouse ...
Just ignore the USB mouse. It doesn't seem to be related to the problem. And 
yes, in this case I had 3 physical devices (trackpad, PS/2 trackball, USB 
trackball) attached.
