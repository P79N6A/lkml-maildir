Yes, switching DMA off for HD (which was hda, CD being hdb) seems to cure
the problem. Thanks a lot. Does this mean I couldn't use DMA at all with
my chipset, or if I move CD on the second IDE it will be OK? 
And, certainly, I still wonder why it silently corrupted the data... Do I
have bad hardware or something weird in the kernel?
