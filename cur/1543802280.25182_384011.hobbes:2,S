does the CPU touch the data for these, or do you DMA directly from 
userspace (i.e. "zero-copy")?
if the cpu touches this data on it's way in and out of the system then you 
are going to have a time period where you are maxing out the memory bus of 
your CPU (this may be a short time, but since the bus is either active or 
not there will be a time when it's active transfering audio data :-). 
while the memory bus is busy transfering the audio data your cpu can only 
work on data that's in the cache.
remember that as you keep reading the data from memory it will push other 
stuff out of your cache.
what magic do you pull to have the CPU busy on other things while the 
cache (and memory bus) is being occupied by the audio data transfers?
