I will check that particular cable on monday, but it *should* be CAT6 not
very cheap cable (Japanese brand: Elecom). In the worst case it is a CAT5e
from probably the same brand. (just because there are no other cables in the

Can these errors be caused by bad hub?

sure before or after) as the error in dmesg.
