Subject: [PATCH] IPMI driver for Linux, version 4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have put a new version of the IPMI driver on my home page 
(
http://home.attbi.com/~minyard
) that fixes a bug.  A previous 
unannounce version is there (v3) that adds IPMB broadcast support and 
fixes a bug.  If you are using this driver, you want to update to the 
newest version.  These are only supplied as a patches against the 
previous version since the patches are small and apply to all kernel 
versions.  If someone wants a full patch, I can do that, too.
I was toying with the idea of adding a socket interface to the IPMI 
driver.  This way, it would naturally handle separation of addressing 
and data, and it wouldn't take up a character device.  I think I could 
map everything the driver does into standard network calls, and the IPMB 
bus is sort of a network, anyway.  Does anyone have any opinions on this?

PS - In case you don't know, IPMI is a standard for system management, 
it provides ways to detect the managed devices in the system and sensors 
attached to them.  You can get more information at
