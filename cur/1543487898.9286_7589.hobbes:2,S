I spoke too soon, the machine just locked up hard- no ping or anything and
had this on the screen:
The error message on AudioGalaxy server 3:
<-------->
process <a whole bunch of strange ascii letters>
Then it say "Aiee, killing interrupt handler"
I'm sorry I cannot be more specific.  I cannot re-produce the ascii
letters.
<-------->
(this is a co-located server so this is from one of the admins at the ISP)
Note this is with Alexander's patch with max_files*2
Thanks
