This change does not really change irq-flow semantics, what it does is 
that disable_irq()'s effect is delayed. The irq controller does not have 
to re-assert the irq, we've got the soft-resend mechanism. What am i 
missing? Are you worried about this change causing actual breakage? (and 
i'm sorry about not having Cc:-ed you explicitly, i could have sworn you 
were included in that discussion but apparently not!)
