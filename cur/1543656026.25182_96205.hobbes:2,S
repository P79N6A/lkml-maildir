This is a HP ze5155 (big, heavy and horrible, but cheap). But I seriously
doubt that is the real issue: I suspect that the reason I see it on that
machine is (a) I was travelling the last three days and that was the only
machine I had and (b) because X is flaky at starting up on it, I wasn't in
X all the time like I normally am.
