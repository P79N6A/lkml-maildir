	sa_family_t is used as type name (which it is) but gcc didn't see
the corresponding typedef, so it stares at the body of struct definition
and sees unknown identifier in the place where the type should be. For
what gcc cares, it is not different from
struct foo {
	undefined_name bar;
}
	sa_family_t is defined in linux/socket.h *if* you insist on using
the kernel headers at all.
	What's wrong with sys/un.h, BTW?
