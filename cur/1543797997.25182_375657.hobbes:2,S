hmm, patch still attached instead of inlined... :-(
Anyway, a few minor comments below.

I still think this should be printk(KERN_ERROR ...) and not just a
warning, since the loading of the module will fail completely. Others
may disagree ofcourse, but that's my oppinion.

A few general things:
I still worry a bit about the spinlock hold time, especially since you
are doing two linear searches through what could potentially be a
*lot* of symbols.. It may not be a problem (do you have any time
measurements?), but it still seems to me that using a lock type that
allows you to sleep + a call to schedule() would be a good thing for
those loops.
Also, what about the softlockup watchdog? Do we risk falsly triggering
that?  Would a call to touch_softlockup_watchdog() between the two
loops, or maybe even inside each loop, be a good idea?  again, depends
on how long this all takes.
All in all, looks a lot better to me than the previous version.
