True. Although I'd imagine it may be something distros may want.
For example, a generic x86-64 kernel for both AMD and Intel systems
could easily have SMT and NUMA turned on.
I agree with the downside of exercising less code paths though.
What about putting as a (default to off for 2.6) config option in
the config embedded menu?

I guess there is the SMT issue too, and even booting an SMP kernel
on a UP system. Also small ia64 NUMA systems will probably have one
redundant NUMA level.
If/when topologies get more complex (for example, the recent Altix
discussions we had with Paul), it will be generally easier to set
up all levels in a generic way, then weed them out using something
like this, rather than put the logic in the domain setup code.
