if a USB driver doesn't define suspend/resume methods, then the core simply
unplugs it on suspend, and replugs on resume (IIRC).  Maybe Matthieu is trying
for something better - hopefully he will explain.  Since this is a modem, it
would be nice if the internet connection sprang back to life on resume, which
requires more work than unplug/plug.  I've no idea what needs to be done to achieve
this.  These modems use the ATM networking layer by the way, I don't know if that
makes things easier or harder.
Ciao,
Duncan.
