It was gentoo, and I even think I installed it right onto the GPT disk, 
so no migration. But I'm not sure. You just have to look that your 
kernel supports GPT. I don't know if the kernel from the gentoo livecd 
supports GPT.
Also have a look here how to create GPT partitions:
http://www.google.ch/search?q=site
%3Ausefulthings.org.uk+gpt
I think I did it like it's shown there, mklabel, mkpart and mount them.
I don't think I migrated from MSDOS to GPT, because I don't even know 
how it'is possible if you have only one disk with the system on it.
While looking for gentoo GPT support, I found this:

Looks like CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION is enabled by default now on the newer 
kernels.
