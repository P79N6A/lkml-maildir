I was trying to say that since enum supports non-contiguous numbering,
any sequence of integer #defines can be trivially converted to enum
declaration:
...
#define ERESTARTSYS     512
#define ERESTARTNOINTR  513
#define ERESTARTNOHAND  514     /* restart if no handler.. */
#define ENOIOCTLCMD     515     /* No ioctl command */
#define ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK 516 /* restart by calling sys_restart_syscall */
...
enum {
...
	ERESTARTSYS     = 512,
	ERESTARTNOINTR  = 513,
	ERESTARTNOHAND  = 514,     /* restart if no handler.. */
	ENOIOCTLCMD     = 515,     /* No ioctl command */
	ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK = 516, /* restart by calling sys_restart_syscall */
...
};
