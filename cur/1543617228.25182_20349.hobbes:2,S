This is something I've wondered about and would like to ask for clarification 
on: the relationship between the initramfs image and the kernel, build 
process-wise.
How much of the build process for the initramfs will be integrated with the 
kernel build?  Since the kernel won't boot without a matching initramfs, I 
take it that some kind of initramfs will be a kernel build target now?
There's been a lot of talk about having the source for a mini-libc (uclibc, 
dietlibc, some combo) in the kernel tree, and other people saying we should 
just grab the binary for build purposes.  The most obvious model I can think 
of for klibc staying seperate from the kernel is the user-space 
pcmcia/cardbus hotplug stuff, but that DID get integrated into the kernel.
The klibc source/binary debate still seems to be ongoing, but apart from 
that, will the build process for initramfs be part of the kernel build or not?
