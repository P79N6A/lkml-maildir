I'm trying 2.6.18-rc1 on a Thinkpad T60 (dual-core T2400, SATA hard
drive) running Ubuntu 6.06.  The kernel is SMP and PREEMPT and has
many lock validation options turned on.  During boot the lockdep
checker reports good news:
[   20.936404] Good, all 218 testcases passed! |
When I pressed Fn-F4 (for suspend-to-ram), it began to suspend,
blanked the screen, and then came back right away to the X session.  I
don't think it ever made it into suspend mode (I've reported the
suspend problem to linux-acpi).  And this lockdep warning showed up:
[  459.756000] BUG: warning at kernel/lockdep.c:1799/trace_hardirqs_on()
