In networking, I would not be at all surprised, given things like fib_trie
and netfilter usage.  In addition, if rcu_read_lock() is called from
hardirq or NMI/SMI, it is necessary to add the nesting levels in these
environments as well.  In any case, rcu_read_lock() is freely nestable,
so there is no penalty for nesting pretty deeply.  I must have missed this
WARN_ON_ONCE() being added to rcu_read_lock() -- I did ack Daniel Walker's
check for negative values of rcu_read_lock_nesting in rcu_read_unlock(),
but saw no upper-limit checks.
So, are you running into a situation where rcu_read_lock_nesting is
growing unboundedly?
I would not expect the per-task nesting level to normally be a function
of the number of CPUs -- unless one was doing some sort of nested scan
of RCU-protected per-CPU data structures or some such.  So if you are
adding this to your local build as a debug check, I would suggest a fixed
limit -- but would -not- suggest putting such a check into a production
build, at least not for a small limit.
