I am well aware of what netatalk does. However netatalk
isn't as widely used as Samba. Things they can get away
with would cause our user community to flay us alive.
We need a proper solution, not a nasty hack.
That's like me telling you to "learn from *BSD". You have
different user constituencies, you have to serve yours,
I have to serve mine.
