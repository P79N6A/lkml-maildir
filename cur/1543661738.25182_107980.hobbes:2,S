   So here is new patch.
Ok, it generally looks fine, and try_module_get() is cheap enough
(basically the equivalent of a local-cpu statistic bump plus
a compare) that I'm not concerned about any added overhead.
And since it is fixing a bug... :-)
Just let me discuss some things with Alexey before I apply this.
