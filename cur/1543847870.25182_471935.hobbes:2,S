It is troubling that Linux now gets to add the burden of MacOS bug compatibility to
Windows bug compatibility.  I asked the apple folks and they
said they didn't see anyplace in MacOS where SCI_EN is restored
from the OS, so perhaps we are following a different path through
their firmware...
I don't think the risk here isn't that setting SCI_EN is going to break something.
The risk is that excluding it from ACPI_PM1_CONTROL_PRESERVED_BITS
will allow other writes to this register to clear that bit from the OS,
which is clearly counter to what the spec says to do.
But I looked through bugzilla to see if there are any systems whose
SCI isn't working, and I did not find any systems where the old
behaviour of not explicitly preserving SCI_EN breaks the SCI.

All I know is that bit 9 is to be "Ignored", which the spec says to preserve
along with other "Reserved" hardware register bits -- so we should
keep bit 9 in the mask.

Lets stick with the minimum patch until we learn more.
