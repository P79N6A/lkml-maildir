Uuh, now you are beating me with my old statements ;-)
tmpfs has the drawback that the in memory data structures are bigger
than ramfs'. But the core of tmpfs is always compiled in for anonymous
shared memory. And it has size limits. So you are probably right, that
tmpfs is the right choice. 
But you are arguing at a corner case. tmpfs is IMHO more often used on
machines with swap and (at least for me) the use of swap as store for
temporary data is the big point to use tmpfs. So the percentile should
take swap into account.
