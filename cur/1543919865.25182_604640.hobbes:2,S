Hi,
I am using an ARM processor with CS8900 Ethernet card, it works fine in 
kernel 2.6.11. But, recently I upgraded it to kernel 2.6.22, the 
ipconfig.c started up a bond0 instead of eth0 with an IP address I 
actually assigned to eth0 in cs89x0.c. The trouble was I cannot event 
ping the ip address. Any advice why this was happend and how to fix it?
Thank you.
Jim
