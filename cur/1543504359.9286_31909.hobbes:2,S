[CC me in replies, I'm not on linux-kernel]
Background from the thread on linuxppc-dev: with the current vger tree,
gdb's breakpoints are apparently being set in the wrong copy of a
shared library, and not properly removed.  After running gdb over any
program, even with no extra breakpoints set, every dynamically linked
program run inside or outside of gdb dies with SIGTRAP.  The SIGTRAP
appears to be in _dl_debug_state or thereabouts in ld.so.
However, it now appears that this is symptomizing some much larger
problems with mmap().

Woah!
I've found a much simpler test case for this problem.  It seems to me
to be more than ptrace being broken.  I wrote two test programs; mmap1
merely opens a file, mmaps it, closes it, prints some debugging info,
sleeps, and prints a little more.  Notice the permissions:
  int fd = open("testfile", O_RDONLY);
  ptr = mmap(0, 0x4000, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
  close(fd);
'attach' attaches to mmap1 and changes one value via PTRACE_POKEDATA.
Regard this:
drow:~/mmap$ dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile bs=4096 count=4
4+0 records in
4+0 records out
drow:~/mmap$ od testfile
0000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000
*
0040000
drow:~/mmap$ ./mmap1
ptr[0x3000] is 0.
ptr + 0x3000 is 0x30017000.
And I am 1446
(in another window)
drow:~/mmap$ ./attach 1446 0x3001700
Value read was 0.
Value reread was 1.
(in the first window)
ptr[0x3000] is 1.
drow:~/mmap$ od testfile
0000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000

0030000 000000 000001 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000
0030020 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000

Now hold on one second here!  We just changed the testfile that we'd
opened readonly and mmaped read|exec.  Something is definitely messed
up here.  Worse yet, this happens even if I have no permission to write
to the testfile.
Hopefully this is just on powerpc; could anyone running vger unstable
on another architecture test this?  The test programs are at

  Can anyone offer insight?
