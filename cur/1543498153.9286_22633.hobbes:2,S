You can extend that argument to many existing device drivers in the
kernel. I'm sure quite a few of them could be shoe-horned into user
space. Doesn't mean that would be wise.

In that case, let's start ripping drivers out of the kernel. And
filesystems too (except ext2fs). Use podfuk (sp?). And take out autofs
and knfsd. These things *can* be done in user space.
You're arguing from an idealogical position. This can get in the way
of good engineering.

The kernel is there to provide services. If some service can be better
done in user space, or done just as well, fine. But if it is simpler
or more efficient to do it in kernel space, then that makes sense. And
devfs most certainly does make things simpler and more efficient.
What matters is the overall design. A tiny kernel may sound nice, but
not at te expense of a bloated and complex user space.
