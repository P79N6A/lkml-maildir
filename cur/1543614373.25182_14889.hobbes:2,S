Hello,
I am catalogizing my set of CDs and so I have tortured my CD drive
with a bunch of less-than-optimal CDs. I had two hard lockups
most probably connected to problematic media.
The last message in log is
 kernel: scsi0: ERROR on channel 0, id 0, lun 0,
   CDB: Request Sense 00 00 00 40 00 
 kernel: Current sd0b:00: sense key Medium Error
 kernel: Additional sense indicates No seek complete
 kernel:  I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 504
 kernel: ISOFS: unable to read i-node block
Shortly (but not immediately, the kernel tried a bit more to get
some data from the drive) after that the system froze - not even
SysRq worked.
I am using vanilla 2.4.17, hdc=ide-scsi, my drive is Mitsumi CR-4804TE,
motherboard is Abit BP6 SMP, Intel PIIX4 IDE controller,
More details available upon request. Please, Cc: replies to me.
Regards
