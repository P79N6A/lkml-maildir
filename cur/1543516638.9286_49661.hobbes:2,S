   I'm seeing single errors in all recent kernels. Errors are so severe
   that I can not do make clean; time make bzImage without problem.
   So far I've seen linux->minux (or 1), major->malor (xor 6), a,b->a/b
   (or 3), GET_STAT->GET_SUAT (or 1), sel_end->sel_eod (or 1),
   pushfl->pusifl, (aha, this means it is not disk because this went
   through the pipe) gcc segfaulting, gcc getting signal 6, memory.c:93:
   bad pmd 0000000[123], bad swap file entry 01ee7006 messages. When error
   happens, invalid data stay in ram so that I can cat the file to see
   the problem. Problems go away after reboot.
   Okay, at this point you are saying trash that hardware. Unfortunately,
   it is three different computers, one of them is my good old thinkpad
   560X, and I've never seen problem under 2.2.X. So my questions are:
   does someone have 2.3.2[68] which can at least compile kernel?
Well, I've been compiling kernels under 2.3.28 on a dual P3 system with
Symbios 53C895 SCSI adaptor, without any problems.
