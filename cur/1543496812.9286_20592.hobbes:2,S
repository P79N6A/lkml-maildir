Hi,
i got some 16 Port PCI Serial Controllercards - Manual says compatible to
Windows NT and Solaris.
Board say Aurora Technologies Inc., Aries 16000P 
There is a big PLX Chip on the Board (I think PCI Bridge or something)
saying PCI9060SD REV1A
00:0b.0 Communication controller: PLX Technology, Inc.: Unknown device 906d (rev 02)
	Subsystem: Unknown device 125c:0640
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 11
	Memory at f3800000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
	I/O ports at e000
	Memory at f3000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
Just to be included in the lspci/oldproc interface and/or someone may enlighten me
if someone else works on a driver or knows what this chip is ...
