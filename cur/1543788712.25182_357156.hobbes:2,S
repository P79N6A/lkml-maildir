Hello,
1. Why don't you put this variable at config, and allow the user to
specify the length during configuration? I have a patch that does just
that.
2. THE MOST IMPORTANT task is to update the documentation at
i386/boot.txt so that it will state that boot protocol 2.02+ field
cmd_line_ptr should not be truncated and can be up to 4K bytes.
Also fix "The kernel command line is null-terminated string up to 255
characters long,..." this is good for the old boot protocol, but not
for the 2.02+ protocol.
Without this fix the bootloaders (Lilo, Grub) will not fix their
code... So that users will still will not be able to use > 256 command
line.
I've opened bug at Grub... and I wait for the documentation update so
that they will modify their behaviour of truncating the cmd_line_ptr
to 256.
Best Regards,
Alon Bar-Lev.
