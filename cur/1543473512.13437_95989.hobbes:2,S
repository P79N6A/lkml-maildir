Actually, this bug sits in hundred of places over networking.
I was obliged to repair it earlier, when it was less painful :-(
The patch is set of one-liners.
: o	bootp autobooting stuff corrupts other hosts arp stuff it seems
Martin Mares made correct ipconfig.c.

They can be merged and they have been merged, but I am still nervous
about driver correctness.
: o	fchmod on AF_UNIX sockets doesnt work like BSD
It works like linux-2.0, right?
Seems, fixing it requires to attach i_sb to socket inodes
to hook notify_change. It may have some bad side effects for VFS.
Is it really necessary? I never saw someone used this feature.
BSD AF_UNIX sockets are intrinsically racy, so that fchmod() has
no real advantages vs. chmod().
: o	IPv6 calls set_multicast_list in the wrong context
Actually IPv6 calls it in correct context.
set_multicast_list must be bh protected, otherwise it is not
serialized wrt transmission. It is all another calls that
are made from wrong context now. I have patch.
