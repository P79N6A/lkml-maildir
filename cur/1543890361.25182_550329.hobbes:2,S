Well, on one sunny day, we'll want to tell the difference between
"cheap" power and "expensive" power.
zaurus running on AC or car adapter is "cheap".
zaurus running from external notebook's battery is something in
between -- given that notebook battery should keep zaurus powered for
few weeks.
zaurus running on external 4xAA batteries or on internal li-ion is
"expensive".
...but I'm afraid it will take long time before we can worry about that.

Check deferred; on battery is completely fine; I just did not see that
message for some reason.
