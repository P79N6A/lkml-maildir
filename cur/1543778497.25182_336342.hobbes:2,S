Let me guess: you started from the default config and just flipped
the CPU option to 486? That doesn't work in 2.4 kernels, since it
leaves the derived "I have TSC" option enabled.
A second configuration round (make oldconfig for example) fixes this.
grep TSC .config to ensure it's not set before compiling.
