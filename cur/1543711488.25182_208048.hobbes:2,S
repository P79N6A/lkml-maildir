There's an outstanding issue that's biting people on ppc64, which is
that arch/ppc64/mm/tlb.c uses the mm pointer and virtual addresses that
used to be put into page->mapping and page->index respectively for
pagetable pages to assist updates to the inverted pagetable. Without
leaving that assignment and invalidation of page->mapping and page->index
in place or converting ppc64 to other methods of carrying out its
inverted pagetable updates, ppc64 (e.g. G5 Macs) support is broken.
