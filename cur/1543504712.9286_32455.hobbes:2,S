Hmm. Where did you send it? To XFree86 mailing lists?

Even the time warp does not appear to occur on my machine without X.
Strange. Only in X I get time warps. But that's just _my_ 4 machines
probably (though 4 machines may be a lot).

It's an option to use my patch, and no, I haven't post this patch somewhere
else. If people want, it may be posted everywhere. Other option is of course
to use noapic.

The strangest thing I noticed (just checked with double trouble machine
here), is that the problem seems to be triggered by X only. Hmm. Thinking:
X uses a device to listen to. That's quite normal. The device is used only
by X. This device is opened with "open(mouse->mseDevice, O_RDWR | O_NDELAY)".
It would be interesting what would happen if I open the mouse device this way,
and if I will _force_ time warps. The program that reads this device should do
simple parsing to show what's going on. As my keyboard goes crazy too normally,
it should be an easy trigger. If I can trigger it outside X, then there's
_much_ less overhead involved.
Report tomorrow (I hope).
BTW: It does _not_ need to be the interrupt handling, it can be the device
handling in general that cannot stand time warps.

And that one is?

Yup. But not only. I've seen one board (GigaByte) that had severe errors
on the lines. (One line wasn't where it belonged to be. It was just not
there.)

I would think that more in the direction that 2 processors are doing
two related things. One changes for example time and confused the other
running driver (mouse device)

partly yes, partly no. No interrupts don't get thrown off because
of the clock. Yes, because interrupts may wait an amount of time
before doing things.

Maybe it is delivered normally, and handled normally. Maybe it is
just the part of the kernel that puts it sends it to X (via the
device in /dev) that's causing trouble.

Unlikely to me.
Think of it this way: The exact value of the timer is only known
to the kernel and the OS. Not to the hardware. So the interrupt
controller(s) don't know about time, only about sequence of commands
and interrupts. Therefore the timing will only impact the delays done
on base of the this.
So if time warps are the source of the trouble, there has to be a part
of the kernel that can't handle it (or a strange hack in XFree86 that
can't handle it).
But first let's see if this is directly causing troubles in the first
place.
