Sure, but almost all assertions are really simple tests, expressions
like `a != (b & FLAG_BIT) && (b != (b & OTHER_FLAG)' and so on.  Those
are trivially side-effect free: there are no assignments or function
calls.  The compiler can prove they're dead code.
There are more complicated assertions but I happen to think they're
either (a) rare, or (b) calls to consistency-checking functions which
can be stubbed for non-debug code anyway.

It already detects when you have an expression with no side effects, and
can warn about it.  It'd be nice to be able to reverse that -- get a
warning when an expression has side effects that it shouldn't.
Sometimes it would be wrong, just like it is for "use of uninitialised
variable", but that's not a terrible thing.
