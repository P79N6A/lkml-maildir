that was niels provos' work... we haven't actually measured its effects
in the real world yet, but it looks promising.
btw, i'd also like to second the vote to get the very latest nfsv2 and

done to help the RAID situation in Linus' kernel before 2.4?
was someone going to integrate some of the IKD features ??
