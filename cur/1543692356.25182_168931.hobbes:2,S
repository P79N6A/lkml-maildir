E.g. from include/net/tcp.h:
<--  snip  -->
...
struct tcp_skb_cb {
        union {
                struct inet_skb_parm    h4;
#if defined(CONFIG_IPV6) || defined (CONFIG_IPV6_MODULE)
                struct inet6_skb_parm   h6;
#endif
        } header;       /* For incoming frames          */
...
<--  snip  -->
This is broken since it's legal to compile a module much later than the 
kernel.
If modular IPv6 is allowed, the #if has to be removed, and the struct
will be larger in the case IPv6 is never be used.
