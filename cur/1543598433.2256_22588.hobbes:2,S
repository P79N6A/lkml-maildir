You need OFOJ or better firmware in your Fireball ST.  The firmware you
have now is known to be bad.  Before Maxtor's purchase of Quantum's
disk line, you used to be able to get firmware updates off of
ftp.quantum.com, but they've hence cleared out those files.  In a
quick look through Maxtor's site, I could not find the relevant files.
