Awesome :) I think it's get more and more useful as people will start trying
to figure out what the heck there is supposed to do with the spare CPU cores.
I mean pretty soon most machines will have 4 cores and some will have 8.
One way to use those cores is the "dedicated engine" model.

I'll cover this in a separate email with more details.

Good catches. Thanks for reviewing.

Those are local versions that depend whether a feature is enabled or not.
If CONFIG_CPUISOL_WORKQUEUE is disabled we want to cpu_unusable()
in the workqueue.c to be a noop, and if it's enabled that macro resolve to 
cpu_isolated(). 
Same thing for the stopmachine.c. If CONFIG_CPUISOL_STOPMACHIN is disabled
cpu_unusable() is a noop. 
In other words cpu_isolated() is the one common macro that subsystem may
want to stub out. 
Do you see another way of doing this ?

Got it. Will fix asap.

Man, the typos are killing me :). Will fix.

That's the thing, we don't really know :). In real life does not seem to be a problem at all.
As I mentioned in prev emails. We've been running all kinds of machines with this enabled,
and inserting all kinds of modules left and right. Never seen any crashes or anything.
But the fact that stopmachine is supposed to halt all cpus during module insertion/removal
seems to imply that something bad may happen if some cpus are not halted. It may very well
turnout that it's no longer needed because our locking and refcounting handles this just fine.
I mean ideally we should not have to halt the entire box, it causes terrible latencies.

Oh, did not know that. Will fix.

Yes. For consistency. We'd want cpu_isolated() to work everywhere.

Will do.

I'm thinking that is reasonable for now.
I'll fix and resend the patches asap.
Thanx
