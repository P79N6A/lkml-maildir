I think this should be a config option.
I use software RADI (md.o) and with 9 md devices,
the 16k buffer overflows, and I get md6-md0 in
the logs, but nothing prior to md6 being detected/started.
I bumbed it upo to 32K and checked the size ofter boot
and it's ~26K right now. If I add more partitions/disks
to the arrays, or more arrays, that'll be too small.
A dynamic size would be even better. Start with 1M
or so and add a dmesg hook to rezize it to 8-16K
and frre up the rest, so init scripts can save the
boot buffer, then keep a smaller buffer during
normal use. If you have problems you can change the
dmesg call to not change the buffer, and keep the
bigger buffer or perhaps make it even bigger.
Has anyone tried this before?
