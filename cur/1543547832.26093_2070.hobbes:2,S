I use test4-pre3 from linux-vr tree.

I used not to. Now I mounted it ro, and, well, it did not help. ls -al
/mnt/bin followed by ls -al /mnt/etc; and I end up with garbage.
I mount cramfs by
mount -tcramfs -n -o ro /dev/ram0 /mnt
after listing of /mnt/bin, md5sum of [relevant part of] /dev/ram0
changes. What is also strange is that ls -al reports error 'file not
found' on on dangling symlinks. (But this is ls from busybox, so it
maybe well its fault.)
