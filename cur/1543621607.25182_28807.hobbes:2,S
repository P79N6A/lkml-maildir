I've got the Tyan Tiger MPX (S2466N) running SMP flawlessly with both
2.2.19 (io_apic.c patched) and 2.4.17 (w/ide-patch) ... and Windows 2000
Pro SP2 (;-).
In the BIOS I've left the setting to ACPI (which is the default).
- Why should one want to change that to MPS 1.1/1.4?
- What 760mpx board do you use?
I'm using an old Adaptec 2940 PCI SCSI adaptor for my DAT streamer and it
also works flawlessly (although I feel there is a little bit of improvement
possible by tweaking the PCI latency).
You might want to check 
http://www.2cpu.com
 for tips & tricks getting a
dual athlon system running. I'm not connected to this site but it gave me
all the help I needed while choosing the components for my nice new system.
It is #1 for duallies!!!
P.S.: Please cc me directly on any replies since I'm not subscribed to
