Sorry, those were two separate points; I should have been more careful
to keep the two separate.
I believe 2.4 has been less successful than other stable series for
two reasons.  The first is the very large divergence of what the
distributions (and therefore most users) were actually using from each
other and from kernel.org.  The second is the lack of stability, in
particular with systems with HIGHMEM configured, where low memory
exhuastion is the first thing I suspect when a customer tells me that
a 2.4-based system with a lot of memory freezes up.
