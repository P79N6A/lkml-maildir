Agreed.

Why? Behind this bridge, there is bus #2, not bus #1. Bus #1 is behind the
PCI-to-PCI bridge 00:11.0.

The bus numbers assigned by the current kernel may look strange, but they are
perfectly correct according to the definition above. The PCI specs don't enforce
any specific ordering of bridges on the same bus, the only requirements are that
that the secondary...subordinate ranges of the bridges don't overlap and that
they are in the secondary+1...subordinate range of the parent bus (which is
01...FF for the root bus).

This gives us the following assignment:
	00			root bus (01-FF allowed for its sub-busses)
		01		secondary PCI
		02-05		first cardbus
		06-09		second cardbus
which doesn't break the rules.

Yes, it will break on any machine with multiple primary PCI busses, because
the registers assigning bus number ranges to primary busses are chipset
specific.
In 2.5, I'd like to rewrite the resource + bus number assignment code to be
able to re-layout the busses and resources even on i386 if it detects it's
safe to do so (that is there is either only one primary bus or the host bridge
is known). This will be needed for proper PCI hotplug and it will also help
us to get rid of some more BIOS bugs (especially on some embedded systems).
				Have a nice fortnight
