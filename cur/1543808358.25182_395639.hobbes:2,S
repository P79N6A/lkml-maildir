Not really.  The question is pretty straight forward, so no source is
really necessary.  Are you just asking this because you want to stress the
next point.

Well, just because something is under the GPL, doesn't mean you need to
post a link for all to have.  You only need to give the source to those
that you distribute it to.  For example, if you give GPL code to someone
that paid a hell of a lot to get it (the distribution, not paying for the
code) then those that have paid might not want to give it away either. So
yes, you can have closed GPL if all that get the binary and code don't
distribute it to anyone else.  Of course once one that has it does give it
away (since no one can prevent them from doing so) then the code will be
opened.

Not really impossible.  As I have done in my (yes GPL) logdev module
http://www.kihontech.com/logdev/logdev-2.6.15-rt16.patch
I have a "hooks" file that has all the functions I need for the loadable
module.  But to call any of the hooks, you must call wrapper functions
that grabs a spinlock before calling the function.  This spinlock is also
used to reset the function pointer when removing the module.  Yes, I know
that this is inefficient, but when the module is compiled into the kernel,
those wrapper functions also turn into direct functions without the need
of the spinlock, or redirected function pointers.
