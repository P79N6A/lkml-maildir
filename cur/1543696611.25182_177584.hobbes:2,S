IIRC this is due to a problem with the cable-detection code in 2.4.22 -
it looks for an 80-conductor cable (which SATA certainly doesn't have!)
and sensibly refuses to enable modes above UDMA2 if one is not present.
I believe this is fixed in 2.4.23-pre, so the best answer is probably
either to install the latest of those or to wait for .23-final to
appear.  (I have the same issue; I've opted for the latter.)
