Hi Bartlomiej,
yes, this patch completely fixes it. Looks very good now even.
I loaded it with option noraid=1

So all those drive seek errors are gone too.
Hdparm does not complain anymore, speed is OK.
Nice, so I can get rid of libata again, as all other drives run with the
IDE layer too. 
Many thanks!
Shall I test it without "noraid=1" too?

Thomas
