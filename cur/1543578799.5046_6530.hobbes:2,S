I get messages in syslog looking like:
Undo loss 192.147.174.183/59953 c2 l0 ss2/65535 p0
Undo loss 63.148.232.53/4423 c2 l0 ss2/2 p0

This is on a dual UltraSPARC box with a Happy Meal network
card. I don't think either Postfix or tinydns (the main load) are using
sendfile().
The machine is stable so far, but it's been up for only 15 minutes.
