Maybe it is because the process generating the output, and the
xterm is not on the same box?  The X server gets too much time,
so the two childs (xterm and ls/whatever) do not get enough time?
And that might be why renice +10 `pidof X` helps? Although that
do not seem right, as the process level seems the same:
  xterm->bash->ssh vs xterm->bash->ls
Might be because the startup time is ruled out (maybe that is
the big issue - startup of child processes?).  Could it be that
the 'ls | cat' situation now again influence startup times (now
it is xterm->bash->ls->cat) if above could be taken as an reason?
