avc_audit() used to always call get_task_mm() when fetching the mm for
use in determining the executable, which was producing deadlock when the
caller held task lock.  However, I changed it to only use get_task_mm
when acting on a task other than current, since we can safely access
current->mm, which eliminated the deadlock for the checks in
bprm_apply_creds.  That is why Serge's patch folds
avc_has_perm_noaudit()+avc_audit() pairs down to avc_has_perm() and
keeps them in bprm_apply_creds.  Hence, avc_audit is no longer a
concern.
The concern is with lock nesting for the flushing code, e.g. call to
force_sig_specific and signal inheritance flush would nest siglock under
task lock and call to flush_unauthorized_files would nest file_list_lock
and file_lock under task lock.  That code didn't used to be called under
task lock prior to the reworking of compute_creds by Andy Lutomirski,
and when compute_creds was overhauled, there was some concern expressed
by Andrew Morton about the lock nesting, iirc.
Note that the flushing code isn't relying on the safety flags computed
earlier by unsafe_exec, so it really doesn't need the task lock for that
purpose.
