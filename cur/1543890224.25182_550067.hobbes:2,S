Yes, that certainly makes sense, but it's the same "special" mount,
which goes away automatically, so there isn't any problem with
unlinking with any number of such submounts.
But I don't want to explicitly prohibit submounting by normal mounts
either, if it's not too hard to handle, and Al's new vfsmount
refcounting scheme should take care of the difficult part of that.
