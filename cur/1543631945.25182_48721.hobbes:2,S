I can't reproduce the problem here.  
What version of dkftpbench are you using?  What parameters?
Can you send me your kernel .config file?
I did notice and fix an embarassing problem in Poller_bench of 
dkftpbench-0.42; it aborted when Poller_sigio sent its initial readiness
notification (it's spurious, but programs are supposed to
be able to handle that).  Fix is at
