No Idea. I also tried to get this working, without success (And no more time 
at the moment to dig deeper). The e1000 driver has the same problem. No 
Interrupts on RX. Someone suggested to "Hook the driver to the timer 
interrupt and see if that works at least somehow", however I'm unsure how to 
do that ;)
