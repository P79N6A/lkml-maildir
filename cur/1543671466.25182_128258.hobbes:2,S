I would like something like this:
/*	fox_compress
 *	@input: Pointer to uncompressed data
 *	@output: Pointer to buffer
 *	@inlen: Size of uncompressed data
 *	@outlen: Size of the buffer
 *
 *	Return:
 *	0 on successful compression
 *	-Esomething on error
 *
 *	Side effects:
 *	Output buffer is filled with random data after an error
 *	condition or the compressed input data on success.
 *	outlen remains unchanged on error and holds the compressed
 *	data size on success
 *
 *	If the output buffer is too small, this is an error.
 */
int fox_compress(unsigned char *input, unsigned char *output,
		uint32_t inlen, uint32_t *outlen);
/*	fox_decompress
 *	see above, basically
 */
int fox_decompress(unsigned char *input, unsigned char *output,
		uint32_t inlen, uint32_t *outlen);
Then the mm code can pick any useful size for compression.

evolving in time are relatively poorly developed.
