Argggg, 2.6.19 (with 2.6.20-rc5 adma stuff) is affected too (BTW, what do you 
do to trigger the exceptions? Because, it takes hours to "reproduces" this
silly *************).
But, this time it looks slightly different:
ata3.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x2 frozen
ata3.00: tag 0 cmd 0xec Emask 0x4 stat 0x40 err 0x0 (timeout)
ata3: soft resetting port
ata3: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 300)
!!!
ata3.00: failed to IDENTIFY (INIT_DEV_PARAMS failed, err_mask=0x1)
ata3.00: revalidation failed (errno=-5)
ata3: failed to recover some devices, retrying in 5 secs
!!!
ata3: hard resetting port
ata3: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 300)
ata3.00: configured for UDMA/133
ata3: EH complete
SCSI device sda: 488395055 512-byte hdwr sectors (250058 MB)
sda: Write Protect is off
sda: Mode Sense: 00 3a 00 00
SCSI device sda: drive cache: write back
Oh, and I got this nice SMART Error:

Powered_Up_Time is measured from power on, and printed as

SS=sec, and sss=millisec. It "wraps" after 49.710 days.
Error 1 occurred at disk power-on lifetime: 5603 hours (233 days + 11 hours)
  When the command that caused the error occurred, the device was in an 
unknown state.
  After command completion occurred, registers were:

Maybe, it's really the HDD!
