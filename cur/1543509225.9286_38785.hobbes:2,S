I had _much_ more trouble with Win9[58] and a non-PnP monitor than with
Linux.  As in works at 1024x768 in Linux, at most 400x320 in Win98, 320x200
in Win95. Strangely, works fine in WinNT at 1024x768. Go figure.

Not always. Lately much less than before.

That is part of the job the XFree86 people do: Get the data you outline,
and use it right. Note that very often the only information you have is
that the WeirdBrand (TM) video card has a XYZ model foo chip on it, nothing
more. Often not even the manufacturer's drivers work right in WinXX (Yep,
happened to me. Had to get a driver for the chip).
