Hi there,
just a side note. It is recommended that you use the mga.o from dri tree
anyway...
not the one from the kernel tree. That won't help much about the
underlying problem with the loading order but since there is no way to
compile the mga.o in from the dri tree the problem itself vanishes ;-)
Greetings
Michael
