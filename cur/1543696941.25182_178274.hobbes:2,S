Hi Al,
On the same subject, but a different issue:
In the ->open() method I allocate a seq->private like this:
  err = seq_open(file, sop);
  if (!err) {
	struct seq_file *m = file->private_data;
	m->private = kmalloc(sizeof(struct ctask), GFP_KERNEL);
        if (!m->private) {
                        kfree(file->private_data);
                        return -ENOMEM;
        }
  }
Now, freeing the structure that I did not allocate (file->private_data 
allocated in seq_open()) is not nice. But calling seq_release() from 
->open() method is not nice either (different arguments, namely 'inode'
and also m->buf is NULL at that point, although I believe kfree(NULL) is 
not illegal).
What do you think?
Kind regards
Tigran
