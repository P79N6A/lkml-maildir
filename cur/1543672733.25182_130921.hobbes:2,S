After some thoughts, this appears to be related to NDA processor
documentation not included in the kernel source.
For the kernel or the main CPU, the driver firmware is just data. The
same, as the magic 0x12345678ul that gets written to some register
because [can't tell, NDA]. In both cases, magic data gets written
somewhere and afterwards, things just work.
So binary code that doesn't get executed on the main CPU *should* be
ok, but whether the lawyers would agree, I have no idea.
