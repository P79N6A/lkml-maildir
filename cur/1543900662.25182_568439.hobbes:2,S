I would like to comment from Japanese situation.
I do also think the documentation translation is necessary even if
there are language maintainer are not there. HOWTO like very
fundamental documents will great help for early stage of developers.
The contributors/early stage of developer will be able to follow
coding style and so on if the documents are easy to read.
So, maintain this kind of document in local language are necessary
even if there are no language maintainer.
I believe the language maintainer should mostly take care about the
patch.

I also think that most Japanese developers can read/write technical
English at some level.
