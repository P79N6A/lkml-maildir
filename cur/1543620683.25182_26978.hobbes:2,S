hello *
it happens to me regularly that the x server dies without any
obvious reason.
funny thing is, it takes the virtual text consoles with it, which is
why i'm posting here.
i end up in kdm and i can restart x alright, but when i switch vc's,
all i see is a frozen image of the x screen. i can switch back to x,
and it runs.
all tasks i started on the vc's before keep running, the mingettys
are there, the bashes are there, and i can even blind-type commands
that will run correctly. only the display is messed up.
a blind-typed "reset" has no effect.
any clues ?
i'm using x version 4.2.0 with a voodoo3 card (dri and agp enabled).
this is an smp box with 2 p3/600 katmai.
might this be not a kernel issue, but an x11 problem ?
best wishes,
jörn
please keep be cc:ed, i only read lkml archives.
