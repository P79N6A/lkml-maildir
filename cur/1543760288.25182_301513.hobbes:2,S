For just the main thread (or the thread of whatever PID you give).  You
need to set the PID of each thread individually.  The "everything
appears as a single PID" is just an elaborate parlor trick.  Wool pulled
over your eyes.

You can use the PID's in /proc/<pid>/task/, yes.
Or you can just set the PID of the main thread before it starts other
threads, or use chrt to launch the program, or use chrt to set the PID
of a shell script that starts the application:  Scheduler properties are
inherited.
