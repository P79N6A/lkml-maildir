Most likely they have serious need for a very small subset of perfmon2.
The point of my proposal was to get this very small subset in quickly.
Phil, how many of the command line options of pfmon do you
actually use? How many do the people at your conference use? Or what
functions, what performance counters etc. in PAPI or whatever 
library you use? 
Make use understand the use cases better, that would already help a lot
in merging by concentrating on what people actually really need.
