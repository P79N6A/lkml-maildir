It's a different attitude to doing recoverable systems. I can't fault
nor praise it because I've never used a system like that.

Right, not many systems inside a kernel are the kind that you need a
sophisticated resource allocation/deallocation system except for, maybe,
FSes and possibly long chains of IO operations. I'm not sure what else would
fit in this category, but it's generally counter to the coding attitude
in Unix.
The things that exception would work well for seem to typically be modular
and can function independently from other subsystems in the kernel. Unix, on
the other hand, is pretty tightly interconnected so each subsystem's state is
some what dependent on the others, which can be unwieldly or impossible to
unwind properly.
It's almost the same kind of design style issue as the classic dead lock
problem. Some OSs provide a facility to detect those circular allocation,
but others just bail on that heavy weight idea and make it intrinsic to the
system that dead locks shouldn't exist in the first place. Both solutions have
their advantages, but Unix prefers the latter and it seems to lead to a
much snappier system from my intuition of it.

Not sure, memory allocators are typically pretty primitive relative to
modern GCs. I guess you could apply generational techniques to memory
allocation (stack allocation of objects typical) and have it run pretty
fast, but certainly not as fast as the typical hotwired C path.
It's not the only resource that might need to be unwound. Like what do you do
about IO system commits ? I'm not sure here.
Just bored and babbling here. ;-)
