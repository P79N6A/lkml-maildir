I don't think so.  It's just strange to have shadows for a guest page
that is swapped out, so I pointed that out.  But as the page cannot
change in swap, everything is safe.  I guess that kernel page tables
could be swapped out after a short while in a guest that doesn't swap
its own kernel pages.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
