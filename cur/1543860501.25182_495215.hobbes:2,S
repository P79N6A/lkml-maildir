The problem with random grepping is that it doesn't give you any context.
clear_page() isn't available in this case since we have a couple of
different ways of implementing it, and the optimal approach is selected
later on. There are also additional assumptions regarding alignment that
don't allow clear_page() to be used directly as replacement for the
memset() callsites (as has already been pointed out for some of the other
architectures). While the empty_zero_page in this case sits on a full page
boundary, others do not.
You might find some places in drivers that do this where you might be
able to optimize things slightly with a clear_page() (or copy_page() in
the memcpy() case), but it's going to need a lot of manual auditing
rather than a find and replace. Any sort of wins you get out of this
would be marginal at best, anyways.
The more interesting case would be page clustering/bulk page clearing
with offload engines, and there's certainly room to build on the SGI
patches for this.
