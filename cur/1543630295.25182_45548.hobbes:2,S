   And I'm sure as hell not going to put any lockless stuff in functions
   meant for "normal human consumption". If we create list macros like that,
   they had better be called "lockless_list_add_be_damn_careful_about_it()"
   rather than "list_add()".
That was what I was suggesting.  I didn't intend for the memory
barriers to go into the existing list macros.
