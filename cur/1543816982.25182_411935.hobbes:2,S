Hello,
I hope I don't bother you too much, I thought a long time wether I
should report this at all but well, as an AC/DC fan I can't live
without my soundcard ;)
I own a laptop with a sis7018 sound-chipset and I am running FC4
updated to kernel Linux cehost 2.6.15-1.1831_FC4 (not compiled
myself).
I never had problems with my soundcard at all but some time ago it
suddely stopped to work. I can't remember wether it was a
kernel-update or a motherboard exchange made by service engineers.
Whenever an application tries to access the sound-device I get
messages like the following on syslog:
codec_write 0: semaphore is not ready for register 0x2c
the same again and again, but different registers: 0x2c, 0x2a 0x2c
0x2c 0x2c 0x2c 0x3a 0x2a
When booting up I get a strange message from the pci subsystem:
PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #6:20000@f0000000 for 0000:01:00.0
booting with pci=noacpi did not help or change the situation.
this is the output I get from lspci:
