Right.  For LinuxBIOS not a problem for earlyprintk in the kernel
somethings might need to be refactored.  The challenge in the kernel
is we don't know at build to how to do a pci_read_config...
The other hard part early in the kernel is the fact that the
bar is memory mapped I/O.  Which means it will need to get mapped
into the kernels page tables.

Sure, I will send it out shortly.  I currently have a working
user space libusb thing (easy, but useful for my debug) and 
a rude read/write to the bar from user space program that
allowed me to debug the worst of the state machine from user
space.  I don't think I have the state setup logic correct yet
but that is minor in comparison.
I really wish the EHCI spec had made that stupid interface 16 bytes
instead of 8 or had a way to chain multiple access together.  The
we could have used a normal usb cable.  As it is most descriptors
are 1 byte to big to read.

Yep. It looks like it sufficient generic.  The Maximum packet size
appears to be reported correctly for writes which is the tidbit
I was worried about but otherwise it is just a pair of bulk transfer
endpoints.
