Ok, this whole series of patches have just been such a disaster that I'm 
(a) disgusted that _anybody_ sent an Acked-by: for any of it, and (b) that 
I'm still looking at it at all, but I am.
And quite frankly, the more I look, and the more answers from you I get, 
the less I like it. And I didn't like it that much to start with, as you 
may have noticed.
You say that "At least for mmu-notifier-core given I obviously am the 
original author of that code", but that is not at all obvious either. One 
of the reasons I stated that authorship seems to have been thrown away is 
very much exactly in that first mmu-notifier-core patch:
	+ *  linux/mm/mmu_notifier.c
	+ *
	+ *  Copyright (C) 2008  Qumranet, Inc.
	+ *  Copyright (C) 2008  SGI
	+ *             Christoph Lameter <clameter@sgi.com>
so I would very strongly dispute that it's "obvious" that you are the 
original author of the code there.
So there was a reason why I said that I thought authorship had been lost 
somewhere along the way.
