Subject: [PATCH 0/3] KVM paravirtualization framework
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This patchset refactors KVM's paravirtualization support to better support
guest SMP and cross platform migration.  It also introduces a bare-bones KVM
paravirt_ops implementation.
I've tested this on VT and it works nicely.  I'm having trouble getting a
bzImage to boot on SVM so I haven't been able to test on SVM yet.
