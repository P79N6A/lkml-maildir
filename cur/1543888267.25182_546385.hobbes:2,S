It isn't the calculations I'm worried about, although they'll get simpler
too. It is the cache cost.

It would be very rare for the page not to be in L1 cache at this point,
because we've likely taken a reference on it and/or locked it or moved it
between lists etc.

Hugh points out that we should make _count and _mapcount atomic_long_t's,
which would probably be a better use of the space once your vmemmap goes
in.
