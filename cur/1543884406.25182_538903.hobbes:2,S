Hello together,
The description of this option needs to be extended to be correct:)

          Say Y here if you want support for the special keys (Fn, Numlock) on
-         Apple iBooks and PowerBooks.
+         Apple iBooks, PowerBooks, MacBooks and MacBook Pro's.
 
          If unsure, say N.
This option is needed on the Apple Intel Laptops, too.
I would suggest to rename USB_HIDINPUT_POWERBOOK because its needed on Apple Laptops.
Maybe USB_HIDINPUT_APPLELAPTOPS or something like this. Is a renaming patch for this welcome?
Thanks for your answer/applying.:)
