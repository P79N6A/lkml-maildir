Now tell me where you are going to find a board which has firmware that
can load entire kernels but has size limits below the flash size. I'd like to 
know so I can avoid a vendor that braindead.
People are sitting around constructing what if cases that get sillier and
sillier. Show me a real board with real limits that can only be solved with
a kernel tftp ..
