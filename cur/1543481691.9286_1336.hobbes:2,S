Hi,
I posted this earlier, about 2.2.0pre4 (and got no response), but it is also
true for 2.2.0pre9 (aka 2.2.0-final):
fvwm's module FvwmCommandS works fine for 2.0.36, but dies with
"FvwmCommandS: dead pipe" on the latest kernels.
I've also posted this question to the fvwm mailing list. I can't tell if
it's a kernel problem or an fvwm problem, but it's definitely confirmed on 2
machines.
Zack
