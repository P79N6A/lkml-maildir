I agree. I consider the patches Thomas and myself just posted as a
temporary workaround (even though we can't say how long this
"temporary" will last). Ideally, we should register the I/O ports
declared in ACPI OpRegions - just not now as it would break too many
drivers. Time we tell how "clean" we manage to go.
