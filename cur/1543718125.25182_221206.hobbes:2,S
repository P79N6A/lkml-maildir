Steven, could you give this a try as well?  It is against 2.6.6-mm3, but
should work against vanilla too:
reiserfs_file_write unlocks the pages it operated on before updating
i_size.  This can lead to races with writepage, who checks i_size when
deciding how much of the file to zero out.
This patch also replaces SetPageReferenced with mark_page_accessed() in
reiserfs_file_write
