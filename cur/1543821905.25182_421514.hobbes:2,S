No, in this case they're not. Clear text error messages, compared to 
obscure numerical error codes or no reports at all, are a very useful 
attribute of free operating systems that I do not want to miss because 
somebody is trying to please clueless Joe User.

I already explained in a previous reply why this message IS undisputably 
useful for me, and others have done the same. Why are we discussing if you 
don't read what we write but have obviously already made up your mind?

No it's not, the keyboard is in fact reporting too many pressed keys.
> But throwing 'Windows' around is not useful
It is useful to show you what kind of environment many users do not want 
to have. Hiding information is not user-friendly for the experienced user, 
only for the novice.
