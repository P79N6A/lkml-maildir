And it is left up to the arch in my patch, I've simply imposed a little more
order on what, up till now, has been a pretty chaotic corner of the kernel,
and provided a template that satisfies a wider variety of needs than the old
one.
It sounds like the table translation you're doing in the hypervisor is
exactly what I've implemented in the kernel.  One advantage of going with
the kernel's implementation is that you get the benefit of improvements
made to it, for example, the proposed hashing scheme to handle extremely
fragmented physical memory maps.
