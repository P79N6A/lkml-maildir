Andrew,
I did run the multiple copies of the direct_read_under test on:
KERNEL					RESULT
======					======
2.6.3-rc2-mm1				Sees uninitialized data
2.6.3-rc2-mm1 + wait_on_buffer() in
  __block_write_full_page		no uninitialized data seen
2.6.3-rc2-mm1 + __set_page_dirty_nobuffers
  if cannot lock_buffer in
  __block_write_full_page		Sees uninitialized data
2.6.3-rc2-mm1 + wb_rwsema patch		no uninitialized data seen
There looks like there are potential race conditions with
the rwsema in do_writepages() since a page can be moved back
to the dirty list while waiting on the down_write() and also
with multiple filemap_fdatawait()s.  I have pointed this out before
but I do not have a test that can reproduce the problem.
The rwsema patch does make the direct_read_under test pass.
It ran overnight without errors.
I want to close all the potential race conditions, but since
this patch is a step in the process and the test ran correctly
with it, I submitted the patch.
I'll send out updated patches as I do more testing.
Daniel
