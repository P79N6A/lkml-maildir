AMD K6, 32MB, IDE hard drive, RH5.0 w/new kernel
I don't know what could be causing this, but 'tar' is really slow on 
recent kernels. When unpacking something, it will unpack four or five files, 
pause about five seconds, unpack a few more, pause again, and so on. It 
literally took three hours to unpack the whole 2.2.0 kernel source. 
(Normally it's something like a minute or so.)
The data points I have:
2.1.126: works fine (file names scroll by lickety-split)
2.1.129: exhibits the problem (noticed it when unpacking 2.2.0)
2.2.0-pre1 to pre4: all have the problem.
(I actually reboot to 2.1.126 when I have to untar something!) I haven't 
noticed any other slowness. Kernels I've tried before 2.1.126 (back to 
2.1.106) and 2.0.3x don't exhibit the symptom.
