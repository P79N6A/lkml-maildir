What happens when you have multiple guests, is this state cummulative?  
I've glanced over these patches and the #ifdefs are ugly..., esp since
the overhead seems to exist even if you don't run any Guest CPUs.  Or
whatever you're doing here.
Please justify this patch more in terms of what it provides and why
it's a good thing to have.  
Thanks,
John
