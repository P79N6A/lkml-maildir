No - and at first sight that's not a kernel device-mapper problem.
Please grab some diagnostics:
  run the lvmdump script (present in the newest packages) or from here:
  
http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/LVM2/scripts/lvm_dump.sh?content-type=text/plain&cvsroot=lvm2
with the -a and -m flags.
[NB If you use dm-crypt and have userspace device-mapper < 1.02.13 you
need to remove the encryption keys from the 'dmsetup' output by hand.]
