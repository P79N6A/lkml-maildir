Sounds like a good idea to me. Here's a patch. Does this look OK to you 
Greg?  
I was tempted to write udev 031 or so, since Documentation/Changes is 
supposed to list absolute minimum versions, and as far as I could read 
from your previous posts 030 would have been the last one with the lock-up 
bug, but then I read this little bit in the udev 058 announcement:
	"Note, if you are running a kernel newer than 2.6.12-rc4 
	 (including the -mm releases) and you have any custom udev rules, 
	 you MUST upgrade to the latest version to allow udev to work 
	 properly."
And given that the latest release at that time was 058 (since this is in 
the announcement of that release), I figured that the minimum requirement 
for flawless operation actually is udev 058 for the 2.6.12 and future 
kernels - so that's what I ended up writing.
Add required udev version to Documentation/Changes
