Giving the IP stack its own directory (leaf?) under driverfs root sounds
interesting enough and could have some potential uses, but in the case
of iSCSI there are a few problems:
iSCSI Names (aka: iSCSI Qualified Names or IEEE EUI-64 names ) are world
wide unique and are intended to stay with the iSCSI Node throughout its
lifetime, regardless of IP/HBA/NIC/etc changes. Also an iSCSI session
can include multiple TCP connections with each different IP addresses,
so the format of $DRIVERFS/net/ipv4@iSCSI.target.ip is insufficent.
This reiterates the need for a sound logical device naming scheme that
fits into driverfs without mucking up the basic structure.  Not being a
expert on naming, the least offensive format I can think with regard to
iSCSI would be something along the lines of:
$DRIVERFS/virt/iscsi/iqn.2002-06.com.foo.super.turbo.disk.array.3543/disk0
being the iqn for an iSCSI Target node as viewed by an iSCSI Initiator
node.
