Use the same as for P-III.
The P-M has the same instruction decoder (and execution unit) setup as
the P-III, which is *very* different from P-IV (which has one decoder
only, and then a trace cache for the decoded uops).  This is an
important difference from a code generator point of view.
From reading Intel's optimization guides, it seems to me like the P-M is
pretty much just a slightly enhanced P-III (more cache AFAIR) which
happens to get shipped with a good mobile chipset - and that package
together is called Centrino.
That would also explain why Centrino leaves the P-IV based laptops in
the dust ;)
