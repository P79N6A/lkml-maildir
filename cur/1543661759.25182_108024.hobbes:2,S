I'm just wondering why you are using ext2 in stead of ext3 or reiserfs...
I would still give it a try to boot my system without mounting the raid so
you just can wait untill the raid is synchronized.  Once this is ready,
you can check your raid.  BTW, I had two fans blowing air over my
harddisks but I got the crash because I used the normal flat IDE-cable...
I suppose you really checked the heat of the disks?
Wim.
