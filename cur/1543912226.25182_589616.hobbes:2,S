on the old box where i've reproduced this i've got an ancient X version:
  neptune:~> X -version
  X Window System Version 6.8.2
  Release Date: 9 February 2005
  X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0, Release 6.8.2
  Build Operating System: Linux 2.6.9-22.ELsmp i686 [ELF]
is that old enough to not have the smart X scheduler?
on newer systems i dont see correctly updated glxgears output (probably 
the GLX bug you mentioned) so i cannot reproduce the bug.
Al, could you send us your 'X -version' output?
