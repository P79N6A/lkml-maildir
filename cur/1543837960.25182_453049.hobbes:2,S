One must receive a packet to determine if that packet must be dropped
until tricky hardware with header split capabilities or MMIO copying is
used. Peter uses special pool to get data from when system is in OOM (at
least in his latest patchset), so allocations are separated and thus
network code is not affected by OOM condition, which allows to make
forward progress.
Critical flag can be setup through setsockopt() and checked in
tcp_v4_rcv().
