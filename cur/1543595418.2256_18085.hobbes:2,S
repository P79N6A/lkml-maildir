Ah, fame at last :-)
I'm not on the linux-kernel list but a friend forwarded me this message:

It was in fact a PDP-11/45. Unix 5th Edition was first installed by Peter De 
Souza around January 1975 (if anyone knows Peter's whereabouts please mail 
me; I know he emigrated to the US and I lost track of him). Anyway, the 11/45 
had only 48kb of (core) memory, which was enough to boot the system and run 
the Shell but almost nothing else. We had to connect the machine to a 
neighbouring 11/20 with Unibus cable and a special bus switch box built 
in-house in order to do anything. This quickly improved when we purchased a 
256kb semiconductor memory board from Plessey (the DEC guy couldn't believe 
all that memory would fit on only one 19-inch board :-). It cost 3000 quid. 
We had 2 RK05 removable disks (2.5 Mb each!) and a paper tape reader. Note 
that we had no tape drive, and Unix came on a reel of tape, so we had to 
trudge around various places in the Edinburgh area doing media conversions on 
non-Unix machines. Oh how we laughed. We later bought an SMC 80Mb removable 
washing-machine style disk for I think about 15000 pounds (for which we had 
to fight off the Control Engineering guys who wanted to buy a floating-point 
unit -- yes, the fp was emulated!).
This system supported around 10 ASCII terminals via a DZ-11 serial-line 
multiplexor. Memory was so tight we couldn't run VI, but I wrote my PhD 
thesis on it (in NROFF) using George Coulouris' EM editor from Queen Mary 
College (not Queen Margaret). They were the first to run Unix in the UK along 
with us. I've never known who was really the first because of course there 
was no Internet, not even UUCP mail. We may even have been the first in 
Europe for all I know, though I think Andy Tanenbaum was fairly close behind.
Anyway, I'll not rabbit on. Those were the days when men were men, real 
programmers wrote assembler, and we didn't need no steenking GUIs (mumbles 
into beer).
