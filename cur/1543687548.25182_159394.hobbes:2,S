Thanks for the correction.  I'll resend the earlier 
s/LOCAL_APIC/IO_APIC/ patch then.
Just found another ACPI bug in 2.6:

So CONFIG_ACPI is not allowed on uniprocessor anymore, _and_ it requires 
HyperThreading code?  ;-)  No wonder CONFIG_ACPI didn't appear for my 
uniprocessor Pentium3 'make oldconfig'  ;-)
(ACPI requires ACPI_HT, which requires LOCAL_APIC)
Another reason why I was saying that CONFIG_ACPI should be the toplevel 
config option (even if CONFIG_ACPI never actually appears in any code, 
but only in Kconfig)...
