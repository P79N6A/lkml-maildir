Noone's suggested writing kernel-drivers in anything but a combination
of C and assembler (with as little asm as possible), apart from some
heretics that suggested usage of C++ in the kernel...
This only involves usage of Python2 for configuring your kernel.

Yeah, let's lose the dependencies on perl, make, awk, sed, ld, ar,
nm, strip, objcopy, objdump, depmod, grep, xargs, find, gzip,
wish, tcl/tk and possibly others. That'd surely shave a lot of diskspace
off my buildsystem. It's not like I use any of them for anything else...
Hey, lets lose C and ASM too, and create all your binaries by
writing hexvalues into a file.
