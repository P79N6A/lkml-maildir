Thanks for responding.  I am very interested to find the source of this 
problem.

The strange thing is that all the ports on the card work fine for a few 
minutes, then when some condition (as yet unknown) occurs the system 
locks up hard.  I am currently using a PCI bus analyzer to capture bus 
activity just prior to the lockup to try and find out what leads up to 
this condition.

I am aware of the bridge chip on the card but not sure what you mean 
when you say this explains the issues?  I sure would like to figure out 
a way around this.

I will look into that on Monday and report what I find.  It seems like 
it is premature to say how much effort the fix will take since the 
problem is not yet known?  At least not known to me yet.  I would just 
like to find out what parameters on the bridge/bridges might affect this 
problem and how to modify them.
