My opinion is that, unless the flash is really cheap, or it is being  
written to excessively, that it probably doesn't matter too much.   
With the growth in size of flash, just how long do you think it will  
continue to be used before you go to something larger?
A 256MB flash of a few years ago has been supplanted in many cases by  
today's 2-4gb memory.
One suggestion with ext2 might be to mount it with the noatime  
option, so it doesn't update the last access time for directories and  
files.  Otherwise, you are doing a write even when you only plan to  
read a file.
