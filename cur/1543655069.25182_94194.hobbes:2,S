It's not *gone* it's just moved into the kernel...
  F   UID   PID  PPID PRI  NI   VSZ  RSS WCHAN  STAT TTY  TIME COMMAND
  1     0     5     1  15   0     0    0 bdflus SW   ?    0:00 [bdflush]
Clearly it doesn't need the syscall interface, so as long as there's a way
to tune useful parameters the interface isn't needed. Don't know why I
thought I was doing stuff using that.
