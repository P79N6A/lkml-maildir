Right, that's why I think bi-directional needs to be one way op followed
by one way op ... even if it is to the same buffer.  That should be a
general enough paradigm for everything.

It's bus specific ... it means that the bus must be programmed to expect
the device to transfer both to and from the memory buffer.  There are a
very few drivers which do this when they don't know the actual transfer
direction, so it might be reasonably tested on architectures ... but
we'd probably have to check.
