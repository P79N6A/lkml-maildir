Is this the new Linux way of life? Removing modules is hard, GET RID OF
THE FEATURE! Stats in /proc/partitions are not always correct, GET RID OF
THE FEATURE!
The IDE support in 2.5 sucks rocks off the bottom of the ocean, is that
next?
To the point, the stats are there, there are used by many of the widely
used distributions, this is supposed to be stable, that's the excuse for
not adding features, how can that justify taking out a feature? That's one
of the useful things for determining which (if any) partitions have enough
traffic to be best candidates for a separate drive. Yes I know there are
other more complex ways than looking at human readable numbers. Why is
that desirable? Why not fix the feature (I don't agree it's all that far
off in most cases).
