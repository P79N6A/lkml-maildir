No, it's very much meant to be that way.
We do *not* want to have the PCI memory abutthe end of memory exactly. So 
it leaves a gap in between "gapstart" and the actual start of PCI memory 
addressing very much on purpose.
In fact, the very commit (it's f0eca9626c6becb6fc56106b2e4287c6c784af3d in 
the kernel tree) you mention actually explicitly *explains* that, although 
maybe it's a bit indirect: if you start allocating PCI resources directly 
after the end-of-RAM thing, you can easily end up using addresses that are 
actually inside the magic stolen system RAM that is being used for UMA 
video etc.
So you very much want to have a buffer in between the end-of-RAM and the 
actual start of the region we try to allocate in. 
So why do you want them to be close, anyway?

PS. On a different topic: if you do
	git log --follow arch/x86/kernel/e820_64.c
you'd see the history past the renames in git. Or just do a "git blame -C" 
which will also follow renames (and copies).
