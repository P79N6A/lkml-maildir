Which is the entire problem.  The kernel compiles and builds just fine 
right now, without your function.
If it is "just not called by default" then it clearly can be removed at 
compile time when a certain CONFIG_xxx is not defined.

Sigh.  Repeating, the kernel is still bloated by your sorting function 
if CONFIG_PCI_SORT_BY_BUS_SLOT is not defined.  The function should go 
away if CONFIG_PCI_SORT_BY_BUS_SLOT is not defined.
