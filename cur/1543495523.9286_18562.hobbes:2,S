This must be the world's stupidest question because after 3 or 4 posts I still can't get a response from anyone.  I would appreciate a simple one line email to fmcgirt@swcp.com even if that is the case.  To me it is a real problem...
I have installed 2.2.6 kernel with no problems.  but  mmap file op has
been changed to delete first arg:
Old:
int (*mmap) (struct inode *, struct file *, struct vm_area_struct *);
New:
int (*mmap) (struct file *, struct vm_area_struct *);
Could someone please tell me the approved way
to get a minor device number other than the old way:
minor = MINOR(inode->i_rdev);
Does
minor = MINOR(file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_dev);
work????
