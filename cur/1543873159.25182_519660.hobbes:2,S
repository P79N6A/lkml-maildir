Hm, well.  The general preference has been for the kernel to do a
good-enough job on getting the common cases right without tuning, and
then only add knobs for the really tricky cases it can't do well.  But
the impression I'm getting here is that you often get sucky behaviours
without tuning.

Well, it doesn't have to.  It could give good low latency with short
timeslices to things which appear to be interactive.  If the interactive
program doesn't make good use of its low latency, then it will suck. 
But that's largely independent of how much overall CPU you give it.

For all its faults, the current scheduler mostly does a good job without
much tuning - I normally only use "nice" to run cpu-bound things without
jacking the cpu speed up.  Certainly in my normal interactive use of
compiz vs make -j4 on a dual-core generally gets pretty pretty good
results.  I plan on testing the new scheduler soon though.
