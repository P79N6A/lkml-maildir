- You might want to look at gcc 2.95.1 as well - it includes several of
- pgcc's optimizations (including k5/k6 stuff), and in some situations
- outperforms pgcc 1.1.x.
- I'd recommend against using pgcc 2.95.something for now - there are
too
- many bugs in it.
Why? You have some troubles with pgcc-2.95.1 or just have heard about.
I'm using it from its appearing for all my kernels (2.2.x and 2.3.x).
I still haven't seen an oops or crash, until using gcc-2.95.2
(prerelease
from Debian potato distribution) crashes quite often when hard
optimizing
flags are enabled.
