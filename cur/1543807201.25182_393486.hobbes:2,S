Hello folks, 
I'm writing a simple device driver and want to expose some of its
attributes to userspace via sysfs. 
As usually, I have main device description structure "struct
mydev_info". I've embedded a struct device object there. What I do is: 
struct mydev_info mydev 
{ 
    struct device *dev; 
    ... bla bla bla ... 
} mydev; 
mydev->dev=kzalloc(sizeof(struct device), GFP_KERNEL); 
mydev->dev->bus_id = "mydev"; 
mydev->dev->release = mydev_release; 
err = device_register(&mydev->dev); 
Then, I see /sys/devices/mydev/ in sysfs. I open
pre-defined /sys/devices/mydev/power/state in userspace and don't close it. 
Then I run lsmod, and see zero refcount to my module. Well, I run rmmod
mymod, module is unloaded. 
Then I close /sys/devices/mydev/power/state, and enjoy segfault. 
I thought sysfs subsystem have to increase module refcount when one
opens its sysfs files. Well, there is a release function, but it is also
unloaded with the module. 
May be there is a problem because of I have mydev->dev->parent == NULL,
mydev->dev->bus == NULL, mydev->dev->driver == NULL? But I really don't
have any bus, any parent and I don't want to introduce struct
device_driver ... 
Kernel is 2.6.15.1. 
Although this is my first meet with sysfs, this looks strange. 
Thanks.
