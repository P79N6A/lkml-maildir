Subject: [PATCH] Fix filp being passed through raw ioctl handler
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Don't pass meaningless file handles to block device ioctls.
The recent raw IO ioctl-passthrough fix started passing the raw file
handle into the block device ioctl handler.  That's unlikely to be
useful, as the file handle is actually open on a character-mode raw 
device, not a block device, so dereferencing it is not going to yield 
useful results to a block device ioctl handler.
Previously we just passed NULL; also not a value that can usefully
be dereferenced, but at least if it does happen, we'll oops instead of
silently pretending that the file is a block device, so NULL is the more
defensive option here.  This patch reverts to that behaviour.
Noticed by Al Viro.
