I am sure one can do better than that. The x445 is the smallest NUMA box 
that I know of and the only one available in the context of that project. 
But I am also not sure that this will reach proportions  that will 
outweigh the complexity added by these patches. What would be 
the performance benefit that we would need to see to feel that is 
is right to get such a change in?

Hmm. I like the idea of a separate routing cache per node. May actually 
reach higher performance than splitting the counters. Lets think a bit 
about that.
