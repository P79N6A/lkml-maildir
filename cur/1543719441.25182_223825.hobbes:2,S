This just above is actually due pilot error. I had been trying so
many different kernels that I had forgotten to check whether
console on serial was enabled ... No wonder nothing was displayed.
To recap, I've also got the 2.4.25-ben1 and 2.6.6 working with
gcc 3.3.2. 2.4.25-ben1 still has the same problem as described
earlier with gcc 3.4.0, but 2.6.6 works fine with gcc 3.4.0.
I'm probably going to stick to 3.3.2, though, as I have no
intention of chasing gcc 3.4.0's breaking of some user-space
stuff.
