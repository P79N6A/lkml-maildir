But timerfd has that implicit, in the ticks counter. So if you get ticks > 1
it means you did not read-out (miss) one or more.
By re-arming the timer whenever you read it, that may be some time after 
it expired. IMO the behaviour is better as it is now, and if you want the 
new timer sequence start at a new timeframe, you just use timerfd with the 
same fd.
I do not know about DoS on timers (did not follow the thread), but I could 
easily implement it here, by capping the counter to some value, and return 
POLLERR in poll().
I'd prefer that instead of the re-arm on read thing.
