I am running 2.6.11-rc1 (patched with software suspend2) and no longer
get any sound output from my sound card. My old kernel 2.6.10 (with
slightly older software suspend 2 patches) works perfectly. the
hardware is recognized, and it appears to work, other than the lack
out of output. I have also checked the standard volume levels type
stuff.  Updating to the latest alsa bk patch (from 2.6.11-rc1-mm1)
doesn't fix it. Can anyone suggest what the problem might be? my
.config is attached. thanks..
