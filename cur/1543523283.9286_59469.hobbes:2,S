I think it got eaten along the way to vger/funet/whatever
so I'll just put the url here:
http://sublogic.com/patches/file_operations.patch
Again, it's against 2.3.41-pre2
Feedback would be very welcome... inode_operations has an even larger
case than file_operations (same arguments) but I wanted some feedback
before tackling that one :)
