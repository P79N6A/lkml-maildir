But lockd was automatically started before when it was needed by either client
or server code. Why change it so the user can now forget to start it?
Especially in the stable kernel - I can appreciate the reasons for doing it in
the long term (2.3), but shouldn't we give a little more priority to
consistency?
How about incorporating this into 2.3, but leaving it out of 2.2? 
Or perhaps an alternative would be to call the lockd() routine from statd - at 
least that way the user doesn't have to start a new daemon which arrived late 
in the 2.2 kernel.
