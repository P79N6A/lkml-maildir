The above is wrong. __wake_up in general only does a wake_up_process() for
the number of tasks in the waitqueue.

The most suitable process to run in general is the last one inserted in
the waitqueue even if is going to expire its timeslice because it has more
probability to be still in cache. Anyway this is an issue only for
TASK_EXCLUSIVE sleeps, if they are not EXCLUSIVE you _must_ wake up all
tasks in the runqueue (in LIFO order too even if you won't be sure that
the task that goes ahead will be the last running one). (really in some
case like flock() probably it woud be better to do a FIFO wakeup but this
is another issue)
