I agree with Andi that it depends on the specific debugger. On handling
the general protection fault notification, kprobe handler returns NOTIFY_STOP.
This check missed out in x86_64 kprobes patch. Below patch should fix this,
please let me know if you have any issues.
Thanks
Prasanna
This patch adds the return value check for the exception notifiers at
do_general_protection as pointed out by Chuck Ebbert.
