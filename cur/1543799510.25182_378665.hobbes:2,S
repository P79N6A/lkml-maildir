Because on ia64 IA64_FIRST_DEVICE_VECTOR and IA64_LAST_DEVICE_VECTOR
(from which MSI FIRST_DEVICE_VECTOR/LAST_DEVICE_VECTOR are derived) are not
constants.  The are now global variables (see change to asm-ia64/hw_irq.h)
to allow the platform to override them.  Altix uses a reduced range of
vectors for devices, and this change was necessary to make assign_irq_vector()
to work on altix.
