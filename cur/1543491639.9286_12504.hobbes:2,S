I have been running a BSD/OS 4.0 machine as an NFS server for a while and i
would like to mount it's fs on my AlphaLinux systems.  When I try to mount
the correcly configured exports (from the BSD box) on my Linux machine
(running 2.2.5) I seem to get the following error. 
boxname:/proc/sys/fs#> mount -t nfs xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/usr/exportfs /tmpmnt
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/usr/exportfs,
       or too many mounted file systems
boxname:/proc/sys/fs#> cat super-max
256
boxname:/proc/sys/fs#> cat super-nr

Not a lot of people have any feedback for me on this issue, I can't tell if
it's an NFS problem or a kernel problem.  I'm running the most 'current'
rpm of NFS; 2.2beta37-1 provided by RedHat.  Any help would be great.
Thank you,
-Barrett
