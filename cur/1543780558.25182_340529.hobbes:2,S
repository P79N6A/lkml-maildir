Subject: Why don't register a d_delete function for externfs_dentry_ops in 2.4 kernel?

Hi!
	I read about code of linux-2.4.31/arch/um/fs/hostfs/externfs.c
	I found you have defined a function named exterfs_d_delete, but
	you don't register this function in externfs_dentry_ops.
	This behavior is diffrent from the hostfs code in 2.6 kernel
	It will lead to some strange problem like this:
	on guest UML box:  ls -l /tmp/nonexist  ( the result is "file not
	found", it is correct)
	IN the directory of host os: touch ..../tmp/nonexist
	on guest UML box again: ls -l /tmp/nonexist ( the result keeps "file
	not found",  a incorrect negative dcache hit)
	I don't kown why 2.4 kernel have not fixed it.
	What do you think about it?
	Thanks
