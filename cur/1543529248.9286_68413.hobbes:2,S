David and the Sparc-IDEs,
I have fixed (with a ghost coder) the the base code of the CMD64(3,6,8)
chipset and would like to know if it is stable for the world of Sparc64.
This is in "pre-patch-2.3.51-2" and "ide.2.2.15-13.20000308.patch".
I also tip my hat to "Richard Simpson" for taking the time to do the
ever so hard but critical task of writing the "CMD646 driver timing", for
me on his on accord.  This is the base design for the entire CMD64x
chipset class to perform the "task file transfer" or PIO calls.
This is critical in setup.
