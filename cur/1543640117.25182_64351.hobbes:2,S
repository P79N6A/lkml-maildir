I'm thinking that any _clean_ threading library (pthreads or not)
should do these two things:
   - intercept all the system calls that might call mmput(); that is,
     exit() and execve()), just so it can move the thread-specific data
     (including the stack) onto the "potentially free list".
   - free the stack memory as soon as possible after a thread has died,
     _without_ depending on garbage collection.  What if all the other
     threads are compute-bound?  There's a lump of unnecessary stack
     taking up memory for an indefinite time.
It seems that you're using a futex anyway -- so why not eliminate that
pesky system call _and_ make sure pthread_join() work if some library
you're linked to exits without calling pthread_exit()..
