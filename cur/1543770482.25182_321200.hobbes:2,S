Side note: the patch-applicator scripts will, if the first line of the
email body is of the form "^From: xxxx", and there's exactly one '@' sign
on that line, then it will assume that it's supposed to be the author
info, and use that instead of the "From: " line in the header of the
email.
So when passing on stuff from others, that's always the preferred way to 
do it. A lot of people already follow this convention, and it might even 
be documented somewhere.
