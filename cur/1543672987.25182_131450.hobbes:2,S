Do it from user space, kill(pid, 0), check for ESRCH. I might see the
benefit of a new system call if it was synchronous (wait() semantics),
but since signal delivery is asynch anyway....

Same thing, kill(pid, 0).

There's already a well established way to do what you want (get
non-immediate notification of process death). What benefit would your
approach give?
