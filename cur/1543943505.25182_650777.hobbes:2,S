Pages will still be on the LRU and cycle through rmap again and again. 
If page migration is used on those pages then the code may make repeated 
attempt to migrate the page thinking that the page count must at some 
point drop.
I do not think that the page count was intended to be used to pin pages 
permanently. If we had a marker on such pages then we could take them off 
the LRU and not try to migrate them.
