I am raising a general question here.
Should not such cross-platform things be made available in a general
Kconfig rather than having to patch each arch's Kconfig?
I am thinking of drivers/Kconfig for this one (of course I am aware that this
requires an extra "depends on X86 || SPARC || others" in drivers/pci/Kconfig),
and perhaps even a top-level Kconfig for things like truly arch-independent
fs/Kconfig.
