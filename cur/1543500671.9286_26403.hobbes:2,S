(1) umount/eject from the file browser
(2) an attempted umount would send a different kind of poll notification to
    the file browser, which would respond by closing the poll descriptor.
    "umount /cdrom || (sleep 30; umount /cdrom)"
    (you don't want to block umount on the close because that could be a DoS)
