Subject: Wanted: a limit on kernel log buffer size
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

 Some people (who will mercifully go unnamed) just will _not_
read the documentation, and set the kernel log buffer shift
to 31 on a 256MB machine.  This attempt to allocate 2GB of memory
for the buffer results in an unbootable kernel.
 Suggestions?
