Oops. Do you have some kind of test-suite to run on md-devices before
releasing a patch? I didn't think my hardware was that exotic.
I had a scary moment just now, since 2.6.19-rc5-mm1 without your patch
wanted to fsck the volume, and started repairing errors which didn't
exist on disk. Luckily, it stopped before inode 64, and I was able to
fsck the volume on an earlier kernel without apparent damage.
Still, a test suite seems like a good idea. Also, getting Andrew to
either add this as a hot-fix or release -mm2 would be a good idea,
IMVHO.

It works for me. I can mount the partition, read it, create files, all
is OK.

No problem - I'm glad to be able to do something back for all your (yes,
that's you, kernel developers) hard work. If this had actually corrupted
my hdtv streams collection, I would have been a trifle less
enthousiastic, of course.
Kind regards,
Jurriaan
