Thanks for your work, Herbert. 
Applying all patches results in a "does not work for me". The decryption
result is different from the original and my LUKS managed partition
refuses to mount.
I assume you have a test environment already setup, so I would suggest
to find out up to which patch the following test succeeds (should be
paste-able)
cd /tmp
dd if=/dev/zero of=test-crypt count=100
losetup /dev/loop5 /tmp/test-crypt
echo 0 100 crypt aes-plain 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef 0 /dev/loop5 0 | dmsetup create test-map
sha1sum /dev/mapper/test-map
Result:
368d017dbdb4299ed7f27d3fc815442f7e438865  /dev/mapper/test-map
