No it doesn't.

Yeah.

There's no bridge. It just decouples all voltage lines, so you can
drive it from external supply and/or measure voltages and current.
On the PCB it looks like the the IDSEL line is rather directly
routed to the host IDSEL. It just goes through one of the bus
isolation chips. So I guess (just my guess) that this chip has some
resistance and if the total resistance of the chip + the IDSEL
resistor on the mainboard goes above some threshold it doesn't work
anymore for some cards. In the application note they write
about trouble for IDSEL resistors >51ohms.

Well, they suggest it in the application note as a possible fix. ;)
