Because the overcommit checks in 2.4 stock are heuristic in nature -
they simple compare an estimate of committed memory against what you are
trying to allocate.
In 2.5 and 2.4-ac we have strict overcommit which couple accurate
accounting of the committed address space with stricter rules to prevent
overcommit.
