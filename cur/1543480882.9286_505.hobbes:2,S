      What network card is everyone seeing these using ?
   When I was using 2.1.122 for a long time I kept seeing lots of these
   with my dual epic100 (= SMC EtherPower II).  I assumed it was just a
   debugging message so I never reported it.
It is just a debugging message, I had intended to turn it off by
default two patch levels ago, but a brain-o on my part forgot that
NETDEBUG is being actually set to do the message in net/sock.h
I'll be fixing this brain-o tonight.
Later,
