Hmm. AFAIK "weirdnix" is just alias for "not quite straight Unix
implementation", no ? And my point was that why we need Linux is we want
JUST unix ??? There are already exists "just unix". Even free one (*BSD).
Of course we should not stuff Linux with additions without thinking.

There are limited number of mountable filesystem AFAIK. If you have
500-1000 users you just can not mount ipcfs, procfs, devfs for each...
You CAN provide sane environment with hardlinks, though...

Ok. It IS alternative to some extent. Just not sure if it's BETTER
alternative...
