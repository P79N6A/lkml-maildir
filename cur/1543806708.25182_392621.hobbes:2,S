See the thread.. "Re: 2.6.16rc1-git4 slab corruption"
Pekka posted a rediffed variant of a patch Manfred came up with
a while back, which periodically scans slabs for corruption, which
in the past has caught some bugs where we scribbled in the redzones
of long-living slab objects, which weren't picked up by regular SLAB_DEBUG.
