That is a good point and I believe Stephen has taken this path
from the early start of his patches.

Since ext2 is a multiplatform FS and it performs quite well
for most workloads, I think it's a decent basis for advanced
FS work.
Besides, there already _is_ a new and advanced filesystem,
Reiserfs (which will be incorporating some of Stephen's
stuff once reiserfs itself is stable).
