Some method to switch between verbose and non-verbose mode on the screen
interactively would be useful and it should not loose old messages. Not
have vga configured as console device kind of gives you a hard time
here. My bootsplash patch takes care of this by only "hiding" the text
instead of not redirect it to vga, so the text buffers are valid all the
time and visible as soon as you switch them on
