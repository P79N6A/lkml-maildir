There was no feedback on this one?

We don't need to test for skbc==NULL - kfree_skb(NULL) is legal.
This code will end up running kfree_skb(skbc) twice.  Unless
dev_queue_xmit_nit() takes an additional ref on the skb (I don't think it
does), this will cause corruption of freed memory.

dev_queue_xmit_nit() already clones the skb.  It's a bit sad to be taking a
clone of a clone like this.  Avoidable?
