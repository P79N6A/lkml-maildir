How many users are there that use a specific user account to read
their emails on their Linux workstation ?
I don't, I use my account to read mails, write documents,
develop programs,etc. So even if a malicious program does
not do any arm to the system, it can at least destroy or corrupt my
own files and I will loose time restoru=ing from last backup and
rebuilding recently modified files.

Yes I trust my system security. But even the system is not affected,
since the script will run with my userid, it will be able to do everything
I am allowed to do.

It was just a one line example. Even if does not do any harm to
system files, it will harm my own files !
BTW, how many people are positively sure that they can
run "su nobody -c rm -rf /" on their system without loosing anything ?

Well, you are right; but even if a user does not harm the system,
he will harm himself and there is no way the system can protect him
against it. So we are back to my point: user protection comes from
user education.
