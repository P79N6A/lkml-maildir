It is possible that sys_ioprio_set(IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP) was called after
copy_process() already did dup_task_struct(), but before it takes
tasklist_lock. Documentation/block/ioprio.txt doesn't say should
ioprio_set() be "atomic" or not. If not, we can kill this line, and
(more importantly) drop tasklist_lock in fs/ioprio.c
