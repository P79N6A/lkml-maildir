* beside the new ID 1002:4369, the ID 4376 should be added also (both
  are ATA133 controllers driven by the same Windoze driver)
* ID 1002:4379 works with the same atiixp.c driver, but it is a SATA
  device. Although the SCSI layer should be used for SATA devices, is it
  be possible to use the IDE driver for now? Else, this chipset would be
  unsupported.
  The device is called "ATI 4379 Serial ATA Controller"
* The windoze driver lists the IDs :436E (both in the ATA133 and SATA
  driver)  and :437A (only SATA), but I never tested them.
