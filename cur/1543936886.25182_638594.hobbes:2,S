i think that in general making access to unmapped memory a bit easier is 
generally a good robustness idea as ACPI could be impacted by it as 
well.
Fundamentally, paging_init() has obvious dependency on "figuring out the 
memory setup" of the box, and "figuring out the memory setup" means 
interpreting various data structures passed in by the BIOS - some of 
which might be in not yet mapped areas or iommu areas (if we have to do 
some early quirk). So having a robust implementation of ioremap_early() 
sounds like a definitive plus.
