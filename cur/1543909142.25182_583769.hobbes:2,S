Yes, I think it is a really good idea, much more cleaner.
But doing like that you can have cpustat->system decreasing and thus negative
values in "top".
It is why I modify account_system_time() (see my last patch) to decrease the
value to add to system time accordingly the value we add in cpustat->guest, and
thus system time never decreases. We cannot do that when we call
account_system_time() from KVM part.
