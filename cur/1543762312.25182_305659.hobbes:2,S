I somewhat disagree on this one. If caller specified that command requires
arguments to be sent and it does not provide them I'd rather had it OOPS on
the spot. With receiving, however, caller does not really have control over
number of characters coming from the device so specifying NULL allows just
ignore whatever response there is.
