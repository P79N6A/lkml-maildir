Stephen the problem is that currently when we write to a block device we
only:
1. get the buffer uptodate
2. write to the buffer the new data in the right place
3. mark the buffer dirty and uptodate
4. release the buffer
but we don't start I/O at all, so in a msec we'll be in a state with
128mbyte full of dirty and so not freeable buffers. 
kflushd, update, sync try try try to sync these buffer to disk but it's
far too much for them and the first time an application reclaim memory it
will hog.
Having such many dirty buffers sleeping in the buffer cache without
starting I/O is like a bomb that it's waiting to explode.
So I have a fix for that. make_request NR_REQUEST*2/3 (write case) should
also take care that there aren't too much buffers dirty in the buffer
cache, I think this should be enough to allow good performances
avoiding any risk to hang due not freeable memory.
Here my fix against 2.2.0:

People that is getting problems with `dd` writing to a block device could
try this my patch and feedback?
