2.6.7-mm7 doesn't work
2.6.7-mm7 (with bk-usb.patch reverted) works
2.6.8-rc2 doesn't work
2.6.8-rc2-mm2 doesn't work
2.6.8-rc2-mm2 (with bk-usb.patch reverted) doesn't work
I will test rc1 later tonight once I get off work and post the results.
As stated earlier machine hangs on Starting cups.  If I disconnect all
USB devices it boots, but when I plug my keyboard in, nothing works
unless I hold down a key for a few seconds.  Then the input is shown
on the machine but repeatedly, like I was holding the key.  Example
I'll hold the "s" key and it appears after a few seconds, but like
"sssssssssssssssssssssssssss"  if I hit backspace nothing, but if I
hold it, it will erase all the characters.
Please CC to linux-usb-devel as I am not subscribed.
