I guess I should add that I'm not certain that the code is exactly correct
there are weird differences between enable/disable and mask.  Where generally
the mask/unmask methods do the work and enable/disable do some weird software
thing.  Having them different and enable/disable not doing some software
thing concerns me a little.  I think mask/unmask may been overoptimized
in this case.
So I expect someone will wind up refactor this code at some point.
However the code is clearly better than what we have now, and it can't
affect anything else.
