    Rick showed me schedstats graphs of the two ... it seems to have lower
    latency, does less rebalancing, fewer pull_tasks, etc, etc. Everything
    looks better ... he'll send them out soon, I think (hint, hint).
Okay, they're done. Here's the URL of the graphs:

General summary: as Martin reported, we're seeing improvements in a number
of areas, at least with sdet.  The graphs as listed there represent stats
from four separate sdet runs run sequentially with an increasing load.
(We're trying to see if we can get the information from each run separately,
rather than the aggregate -- one of the hazards of an automated test
harness :)
