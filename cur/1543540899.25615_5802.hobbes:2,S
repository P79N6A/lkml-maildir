hang on a second - isn't the blkdev_get() interface broken? The inode we
are looking for is in fact nd.dentry->d_inode found by path_walk() on
get_sb_bdev() level. So why don't we pass that inode to
blkdev_get() instead of inventing a fake_inode internally? In fact, the
bdev argument is irrelevant as it is visible through inode->i_bdev anyway.
So probably the solution is to have blkdev_get() accept inode as an
argument and not a bdev. Alternatively we can add a bd_sb field to
block_device structure and fill in fake_inode->i_sb from there.
Any thoughts?
