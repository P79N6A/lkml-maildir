Yes. I posted a patch about a week or 2 ago. The original patch can be
found on
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/Linux-2.4.x/2.4.23-rc1/linux-2.4.23-01-posix_race.dif
However, I now believe the real problem here is that
locks_remove_posix() should also be checking the pid (as is done in
all the other POSIX locking checks by calling locks_same_owner()).
It is wrong for locks_remove_posix() to be deleting locks that don't
belong to this pid... Note: this bug exists in 2.6.x. too, although
there it does not cause an Oops...
Cheers,
  Trond
