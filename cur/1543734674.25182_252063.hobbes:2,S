They should be. For the simple design I described the access restrictions
are part of the field ID, so a tool can deduce the exact type of access
restrictions even if it doesn't know the field. There's plenty of space
left for additional access control flags in the field ID.
If it gets much more complex, the application (let alone the kernel)
has to have some knowledge of the security model anyway, so we could have
simple operations that allow a tool to discover how access restrictions
apply to the supported fields.

It cannot easily, and I don't think it wants to. The reason it's hard to
just reply with a subset is that the kernel does not send any description
of the reply content other than the serial number of the request --
it's up to the tool to know what it asked for. So if you remove a field,
you'd have to let user-space know which field you removed. Sending only
the allowed subset makes handling on both sides more complicated --
the kernel needs to build different kinds of messages in answer to one
request, and user-space tool need to be able to parse that.
The way the interface works now, though, is that a tool can rely on
the content of the reply to match the request. This makes the common
case both easy to write and fast.
Let me break it down once again:
- If a tool asks for a field the kernel doesn't know about, that's a
  fatal error. An error message is returned, nothing else (this can be
  discovered before any other reply is delivered).
- If a tool specifically asks for a process which doesn't exist,
  nothing is returned. We could return an error indicating that. Might
  be a good idea.
- If a tool asks for a field it doesn't have permission to read, it usally
  does have permission to read that field for some tasks (e.g. same owner),
  but not for others. So for some replies to one request, all requested
  fields will contain meaningful values.  What about the replies that
  describe the tasks where the tool must not read at least some of the
  requested values? I chose to simply skip those tasks.
  We could also send an error message ("some tasks omitted") or send a
  complete reply with the restricted fields zeroed and a special flag set
  ("some fields in this reply zeroed due to access control").
I'm really afraid of over-engineering something here, though. The fields
requested by tools like ps and top by default are all world readable
in /proc. I showed that solutions fit right in should we ever need
access control for real-world applications. For now, I'd rather not
extend the interface significantly unless the current semantics are
clearly insufficient.
