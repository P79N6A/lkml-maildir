Nice!

Not necessarily. NTFS metadata is stored in "normal" files. So the two 
statements above are incompatible. Either it will work for all of NTFS or 
for none of it.
I definitely like the idea. Especially if we can somehow combine it with 
moving the bad blocks to the "bad blocks list" in an fs specific manner 
instead of just leaking them, it would turn into a software based fault 
tolerance solution for writes, which would be damn neat.
Best regards,
