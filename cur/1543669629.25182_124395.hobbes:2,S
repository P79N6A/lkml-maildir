Sure enough. I ported lockmeter to 2.5.67-mm1 and ran the same rmap-test
and lo and behold all the ext3 issues went away. However, the one remaining
long hold time moved to the top (unmap_vmas):

Here is the port of lockmeter to the 2.5.67-mm1 kernel. If you would consider
putting it in your tree that would be great and I would work on porting the
rest of the architectures.

Here is also the whole locmeter output of this run if 
you are interested.

Thanks a lot!
