Linux is suitable for many use, with a lot of HW.
There are a lot of thing you MUST differentiate, not just desktop and
servers, and uniprocessor and multi SMP
Just think to this, Linux runs on
sprac64, alpha, ia64, pa-risc, ppc and so on, and all those platforms have
work well with it.
Don't you see?
And please, lkml is the place to differentiate, because here people talk
about development, and how to do it at best.

yes and no. Maybe 95% of linux box out here are desktops, and they would
benefit of preemption. For the others, it's an option not to enable it.
But what we were discussing here was if preemption is a greek panacea or
not. And if not, why. And then, How could things be improoved. It is
important to discuss those topics here.

yes, but this is mostly 2.5 stuff. Then it can be backported.

Obviously. This is an important part of my work (and hobby).

for me too, 2.4.17+rc2aa2 is specially good with medium sized databases.

very interested in what you will get.
