I don't know i didn't alter anything in srm mode so as i know the boards should be
the same i have 3 axpci33 2 in mij servers and 1 backup (if one breaks)....

An oeps on mij part i see that i put 2 outputs from differt kernels in this
message.. but in the 2.2.3-ac4 i did use the ncr53c8xx driver..

And then it just does nothing at least in the 20 minutes it i needed to
type this over from the other computer..
Is it posable that on the ncr53c810a-2 irq 13 not the best irq because
on the other kernels it runs up 9,10,11 with the 2.1.130 kernel strange.
After looking around in the readme from the scsi driver that it is not 
posable to set irq's enz..

Wel see above but on the extra 2 scsi controlers there is no hardware.
