Subject: [PATCH] fix in-kernel genksyms for parisc symbols
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The problem is that the parisc libgcc.a library contains symbols that
look like $$mulI and the like, but genksyms doesn't think $ is legal for
a function symbol, so they all get dropped from the output.  This means
that inserting almost any module on parisc taints the kernel because
these symbols have no version.
The fix (attached below) was to allow $ in an identifier in lex.l (and
obviously to update the _shipped files as well, but my flex/bison seem
to be rather different from the one they were generated with, so I'll
leave that to whomever has the correct versions).
