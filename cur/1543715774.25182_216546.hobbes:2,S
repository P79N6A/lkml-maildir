Hello,
net/sunrpc/svc.c has a similar check already to prevent syslog flooding
for such common error conditions:
[] #ifdef RPC_PARANOIA
[]         if (prog != 100227 || progp->pg_prog != 100003)
[]                 printk("svc: unknown program %d (me %d)\n", prog, progp->pg_prog);
[]         /* else it is just a Solaris client seeing if ACLs are supported */
[] #endif
We could also get rid of the printk's in net/sunrpc/clnt.c -- your/Neil's call.
