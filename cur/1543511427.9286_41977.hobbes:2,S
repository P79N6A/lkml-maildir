Hi,
Something related:
Since I've switched to 2.2.x from 2.0.36 I see serial overruns
on my modem-link (something like every minute during a download).
Yes, I know about "hdparm -u1" ..
Same hardware, same config, same software.  Only different kernel.
I have *never* seen any overrun with 2.0.x.
It happens on a Cyrix 486 DX2/66 and not on an Intel 486/33.
I have never been able to trace the problem.  It's weird.
I can dig up detailed bug-reports I sent to linux-kernel some
time ago (never got any response) in case anyone is interested.
	greetings,
	Rob van Nieuwkerk
