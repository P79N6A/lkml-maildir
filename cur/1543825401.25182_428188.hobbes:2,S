I'm not 100% sure but I don't think the deadlock occurs because the
object has actually two locks, namely,
	port.c_src.list_mutex
	port.c_dst.list_mutex
so the above is equivalent with
	down(port_A.c_src.list_mutex);
	down(port_B.c_dst.list_mutex);
When the opposite connection is performed concurrently, different
locks are taken:
	down(port_B.c_src.list_mutex);
	down(port_A.c_dst.list_mutex);
In the code, there is another place that using down_write() (in
clear_subscriber_list()), but it's already after closing accesses to
that port, hence there can be no race there.
