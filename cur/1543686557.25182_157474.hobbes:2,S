Sure, there have always been projects out there that have used the
"native" clone() interfaces, but they're fairly rare, and CLONE_THREAD
being a new addition makes it less likely to show up as a problem.

I've pushed the change to the BK trees, and if you're not a BK user you
can just test the attached patch directly to see if it affects you..

# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

# The following is the BitKeeper ChangeSet Log
# --------------------------------------------
# 03/08/14	torvalds@home.osdl.org	1.1150
# Mark CLONE_DETACHED as being irrelevant: it must match CLONE_THREAD.
# 
# CLONE_THREAD without CLONE_DETACHED will now return -EINVAL, and
# for a while we will warn about anything that uses it (there are no
# known users, but this will help pinpoint any problems if somebody
# used to care about the invalid combination).
