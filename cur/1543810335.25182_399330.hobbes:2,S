Here is one method for posting patches in Thunderbird:
Before starting to write the email, do Edit->Preferences, Composition
tab, change "Wrap plain text messages at __ characters" to 0
Begin writing your email
Start up an editor in which you can select the text, for example:
# gvim patch.diff
Edit->Select All
Edit->Copy
Switch back to the open Compose window, then Edit->Paste
If you have Enigmail configured, when sending the email, you might get a
box asking if you want to change the line wrapping to 68 characters, so
just say No if that happens.
Ideally, there would be a Thunderbird plugin to insert the contents of a
file at the current location with no formatting changes...  Maybe "next
week" :)
