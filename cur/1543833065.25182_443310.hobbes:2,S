Some of the __alloc_skb disappeared but there are still a lot of
context_struct_to_string (812). Could you let it running for a bit to
get more reported leaks (few thousands) and send me the contents of
the /proc/slabinfo file (together with the memleak file)? I want to
make sure whether it is a kmemleak problem or not.
Thanks.
