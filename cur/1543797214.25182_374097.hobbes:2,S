The SIGEV_THREAD_ID option is an extension to the standard and, was 
not intended to be meaningful to user code.  The kernel, does use the 
PID value here.  The main usage intended for this option is for glibc 
to localize the handling of the SIGEV_THREAD option (which is to 
create a thread).  If glibc wants to do this thread creation work in a 
particular "helper" thread, it can change the SIGEV_THREAD to a 
SIGEV_THREAD_ID supplying the required PID, while, at the same time 
keeping track of the needed stuff to do the thread creation.  Thus the 
"helper" thread will get wakened when the timer expires and will 
create the thread.
Another possible way for this to work is for glibc to create the 
thread as part of the timer_create and put it into a sigwait() for the 
timers signal.  In this case, glibc would also want to specify the 
target thread using the SIGEV_THREAD_ID option.

So, it remains possible for glibc to make this conversion, or, 
possibly we have a man page error...
In any case, we should expect glibc to want a pthread_t here, which, 
of course, is meaningless to the kernel so it should either fail or be 
converted by glibc.
