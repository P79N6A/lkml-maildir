	New version of the patch is on
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/smp-patch-11.gz
News:
*	bad race in select (both SMP and UP) fixed. Old code does
	fcheck(fd) and might block before incrementing f_count; to trigger
	that one needs a select() on fdset with >170 members. Exploitable
	(clone() with COPY_FILES, select() in one thread, close() in
	another + right timing). Result being the dangling pointer to
	struct file. With all usual consequences.
*	race in dup2() fixed. (dup2(fd1,fd2) in one thread, close(fd1) in
	another, right timing and you've got both fd1 and fd2 closed)
*	bad race in do_load_aout_binary() fixed (more or less the same -
	exec() vs. close() instead of select() vs. close()).
*	fget(), get_unused_fd(), put_unused_fd(), sys_dup(), sys_dup2() -
	SMP-safe. Big lock shifting will follow - there's more to do here.
*	->files->fd[] handling became SMP-safe (or so I hope ;-). It will
	need more cleanup and quite possibly some fixes, but the main
	part is there. Big mess remains in arch/* - it will be the next
	thing to fix. I didn't include large fd array support, but it
	should be easy to do now.
*	fput() made inline (thanks, Alexey). It still requires the big
	lock.
*	AF_UNIX handling of in-flight count fixed (ditto).
So there... I'm not posting the thing to l-k - 66K is over the top.
Comments are more than welcome, indeed. Patch is against 2.3.9-pre1 and
it's *dangerous* - it may open new races somewhere. You've been warned.
It should compile, but that's about all I can say. To be continued...
							Cheers,
