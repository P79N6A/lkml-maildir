There are multiple ways to enhance the speed for zbuffer:
1. Use an hierarchical z-buffer
Divide the screen in 16x16 pixel tiles, and then a per-tile minimum
value. When rendering a poly, you first check the tile-z against the
poly-z and if it fails you can skip 256 pixels in one go.
2. Use scanline-major rendering:
for_each_scanline{
  clear_z_for_scanline();
  for_each_polygon{
    draw_pixels_for_current_polygon_and scanline();
  }
}
This is easily done by modeling the scanliner with a coroutine for each polygon
to be painted. The zbuffer is reduced to a scanline and is reused for
all scanlines,
so it's rather fast :)
