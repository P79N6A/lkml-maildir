stoock market analysis for beneficial cooperation
Fellow Investtor, big news are hitting on thursday for AGA O!!!
Somebody knows something...place AGA O on the radar!!!
Get ready for a volatile 2nd half of 2006 - one where the Bulls and 
Bears will BOTH be proved wrong. But odds are, we'll see another 
year where the mraket indexes bounce around a lot without really going anywhere. And we'll also see certain sectors - favored at this point in the economic cycle - SOAR... 
Own the right sttocks, in the right space, and you could reap a 
handful of money-doublers. But if you own the wrong investment, you could easly lose 25%-35% or more! 
Here is my Favorite Pick for the second half of 2006: AG AO!!!
