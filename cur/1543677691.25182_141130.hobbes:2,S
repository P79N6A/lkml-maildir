g'day just wandering if some one can help me out here...
i'm trying to use a module from a 2.4.18 kernel
it's for my promise fasttrack s150 tx4 sata cart..
now i updated to kernel 2.5.71 and installed the module init tools
copyed the ft3xx.o from 2.4.18 to 2.5.71, made a new initrd
but it keeps bugging around, i get a "invalid module format"
i built-in all the loadable module support options (incl. module version 
support)
but i can't get the module loaded..
annyone anny idea ??
Greetz.
