Look at it that way: currently filesystems form a tree. Parent can be
found by ->s_root->d_covers->d_inode->i_sb. To prevent loops you need to
preserve tree structure. So yes, checking that we are not moving the fs
under itself is OK here - mounts are serialized wrt each other.

suppose /foo is remounted on /foo/bar/baz. And your PWD was /foo/bar.
Bummer. Try to call d_path() after that. Or simply run find.
Another thing to consider: behaviour of NFS-exported filesystems. That has
nothing to loops. Look at the export table handling in knfsd. AFAICS it
may bite you if you are moving the stuff around that way.
And another one: interaction with lookups. I have a nasty gut feeling that
in current form it has really unpleasant races waiting to happen as soon
as we'll allow to move mountpoints *not* dropping the whole tree under
them.
