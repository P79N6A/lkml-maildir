Yep, the shot that might have useful information is blurred.
I assume you are unable to use a serial console.
I can usually "Shift + page-up" as long as there is not too much data, and
depending on your console, AFAIR I can't pause my console output.
Also, does the adapter bios show the drive at boot time?
Hopefully Justin will add more useful suggestions for debugging.
