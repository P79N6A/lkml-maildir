This would be easy to do in JFS due to the baggage we carried over to be
compatible with OS/2-formatted volumes.  In OS/2, the directories were
ordered in a case-insensitive fashion.  This would have to be a mkfs
option, and would not be a per-process option.  The directories must be
created either case-sensitive or not.
