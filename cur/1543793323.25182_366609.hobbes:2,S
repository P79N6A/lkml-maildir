Ah - no sooner do I send that than I see a key fact.
On this last boot, with no migration_debug and the original config
on a 2.6.14-mm2 kernel, ia64 sn2_defconfig,
 1) The console output to the screen showed one good matrix.
 2) The /var/log/messages file shows six bad (zero'd) matrices.
I have not seen anything these last two days that is inconsistent
with the above two observations.
Presumably this is more some confusion with how the boottime
kernel prints are captured in /var/log/messages than it is
a problem with the migration cost matrix.
The ball is still on my side of the tennis court.  I can't make
out the player on the other side yet through the fog, but I doubt
it's Ingo.
