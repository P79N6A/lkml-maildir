Seems like I've tried everything suggested on the linux-ppp list here at
least four times! I'm still unable to compile ppp-2.3.5 though. Thought
I'd repost and include the kernel folks and see if anyone else has a
suggestion. Basically, this is what I have:
RH 5.1
2.2.1
kernel source in /usr/src/linux
ppp source being compiled from /usr/local/src/ppp-2.3.5
    (from here did ./configure, make kernel, make)
Sorry for the length of the following, but I get this during the make:
[root@logan ppp-2.3.5]# make
cd chat; make  all
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/ppp-2.3.5/chat'
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all'.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/ppp-2.3.5/chat'
cd pppd; make  all
