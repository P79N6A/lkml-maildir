Perhaps it should (have).  It's a bit nasty, but we do have at least two
internal callers who don't have a file*.
The alternative would be to cook up a fake file* like blkdev_get() does,
but we don't want to propagate that practice.
Oh well.  I suppose a lock_kernel() won't kill us.

If possible.  I guess that would require DM to track the devices with
file*'s or inode*'s or bdev*'s.  Which, I assume, would be non-trivial.
