It didn't make sense to be able to unload a module while it's actually in use, how does this work with automatic module loading/unloading (although I can't see how it's going to automatically load one of the sub drivers...)?

Ok.

Actually it was partly because of the urb warning messages on unload... which the change doesn't even affect.

I intend to export all the data via sysfs instead, since the current method of using proc (requiring several large enough read()s and no seeking) isn't very good and I can't see any way to improve it without caching the whole output from file open to close which atm doesn't support.
I was thinking that the MAC address/AAL stats should be removed from the proc output since they're already available from the atm devices proc file?

I don't expect to require any changes to usbatm to support sysfs, since the attributes should go with the usb device itself (and not the atm device). Perhaps there could be symlinks in each direction between the usb device and the atm device (like dvb/v4l do, e.g. atm:cxacru0 in the usb device)?
