the main problem with having two alternatives for the same thing (in
*any* context) is that it gives beginners a distorted sense of what is
acceptable usage.
if you accept both "help" and "---help---", then you just *know* that
a beginner will notice that and start thinking, "hmmm ... well, if
both of those are alright, maybe "--help--" or "-help-" is alright,
too.  and maybe it's just the leading hyphens that really count, not
the trailing hyphens.  and maybe ..."
kbuild is already over-convoluted as it is.  please don't give folks
even more redundant ways to do exactly the same thing.
