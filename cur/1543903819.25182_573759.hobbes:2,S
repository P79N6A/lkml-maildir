Yup, sorry about this one, Andi pointed this out earlier. But the "I"
must still go I think, for the third reason in that changelog -- it
unnecessarily limits the bit offset to 0..31, but (at least from the
comment up front in that file) we do allow arbitrarily large @nr (upto
255, of course, these instructions won't take anything greater than that).

I think I'll rescind the series anyway, a lot of patches turned out to
be wrong -- some due to mis-reading / incorrect gcc docs, others due to
other reasons ... this was just something I did thinking of as a cleanup
anyway, so I don't intend to push or correct this or anything.
