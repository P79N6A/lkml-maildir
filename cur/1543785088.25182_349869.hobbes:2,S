It would make much more sense to simply sed security_vm_enough_memory()
into security_vm_claim_memory() or a better name. You need to perform
the process as one thing otherwise two people checking for enough memory
may both succeed and then both reserve memory causing overcommits that
should not be permitted.
If you jut fix the name you get the right semantics still but without
the confusion.
