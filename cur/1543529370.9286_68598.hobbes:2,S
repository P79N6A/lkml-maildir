If we would like to have a tmpfs I would propose something different:
We should create a generic directory handling for virtual file systems
like tmpfs, devfs etc. Thus the biggest part is done there. If we then
also have shm handling in the swap cache instead with special page
tables the tmpfs should be really trivial.
