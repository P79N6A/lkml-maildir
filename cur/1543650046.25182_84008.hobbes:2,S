Extended attributes support different namespaces, like user.* and system.*. 
The user.* namespace is treaded similarly to the file contents permission 
wise, so users can associate attributes with files. Things like ACLs, 
Capabilities, etc. are intended to be added to the system.* namespace. They 
differ from user.* in that they require different permissions/capabilities 
from the calling process.
ACLs are named system.posix_acl_access and system.posix_acl_default. 
Capabilities could be named system.posix_caps, for example.
You can look this all up in the attr(5) manual page at
