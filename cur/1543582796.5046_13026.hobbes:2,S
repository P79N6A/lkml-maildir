You don't need the i82365 driver, only the Cardbus (yenta) driver.  I don't
think this would cause your problem, but it's possible, maybe try without
it.

What's strange is that I have the exact same type of machine and I don't see
this problem, could you forward me your kernel config as well?  I'll compare
that, and your info from your previous message to mine and see if we can
find a difference.
Later,
