Just because it's old, that doesn't mean it's good. The kernel using the
numbers internally makes sense, but requiring them for userspace seems
stupid. All you should do is open the appropriate device node and let the
kernel figure out which SCSI ID to send the commands to. Every other tool
I've ever seen uses device nodes, why should cdrecord be different? All it
does is make cdrecord more difficult to use.
