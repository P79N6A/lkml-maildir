I have checked commit 7d0c7d676cc066413e1583b5af9fba8011972d41 by Eric
W. Biederman,
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=7d0c7d676cc066413e1583b5af9fba8011972d41
which just make sysfs_mount from externally visible to static that
could be only used in one c file,
but I mean that the static variable is still on kernel bss section,
this consumes a pointer (4 or 8 bytes) memory,
through a grep from fs/sysfs/, it appears that the variable
sysfs_mount is only used in the sysfs_init function,
$ grep -RsInw sysfs_mount fs/sysfs/
fs/sysfs/mount.c:25:static struct vfsmount *sysfs_mount;
fs/sysfs/mount.c:101:           sysfs_mount = kern_mount(&sysfs_fs_type);
fs/sysfs/mount.c:102:           if (IS_ERR(sysfs_mount)) {
fs/sysfs/mount.c:104:                   err = PTR_ERR(sysfs_mount);
fs/sysfs/mount.c:105:                   sysfs_mount = NULL;
we could mark this variable an automatic one, which scope is just in
this function, thus created and destroyed with the stack,
this approach does not consume a pointer on kernel bss section,
Why not do this?
