Right. But where? I was thinking under arch/sparc64/drivers/floppy.S or
such. And then there would need to be some make magic for it to get picked
up and included only for sparc64. Sounds doable, if somewhat messy.
But thinking a bit farther, if every arch and random driver starts playing
this kind of games, we'll soon be in a world of hurt. Not sure if it is
worth it.
Other solution was to #ifdef that stuff into floppy.c, but again at the
end of that way lies madness.
I'll see what I come up with. Recomended reading on the whole kbuild stuff?
