i've one of these things, i don't use a patched linux kernel
as it is a pain to keep up to date.
Instead, i use the "cyrix" utility (sunsite, 
/pub/Linux/system/hardware/cyrix-1.00.tar.gz) which lets
you mess with the cyrix registers for the 486DLC/SLC
directly. 
my exact usage is:
/bin/cyrix -i2 -i3 -i4 -r -c -f -b -k- -e -xCC00,16
modprobe bogo.o 
which boosts me to 22.08 bogomips.
The machine feels about the same speed as a 486sx2/50 (i have
one of these, too).
