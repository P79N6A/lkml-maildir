Erik:
Dmitry Sklyarov was put in jail for DMCA.

So "The Great 'Erik Anderson'" now threatens former opensource developer
with baiting tactics of GPL == DMCA.  This is beautiful.
Richard, I know you will enjoy this one.  People are thinking of
enforcing GPL via DMCA.  Basically killing the idea that people have the
freedom of choice when it comes to software.  Maybe Eben Moglen would like
to comment on this twisted idea of Mr. Erik Anderson.
I really don't care but this is to funny to pass up such a threat in a
public forum.
Cheer,
