My fear would be that this leads to something like the gperf: a
perfect distribution of slab caches - until any tiny detail changes.
But maybe there is a different distribution that is "pretty good" for
all configurations and better than powers of two.

Unlikely.  SLOB should be better than SLAB for those purposes, no
matter how you arrange the slab caches.
