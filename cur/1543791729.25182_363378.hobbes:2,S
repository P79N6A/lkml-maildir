Be that way ;).

My motivations for the per-cpuset, digitally filtered rate, as opposed
to the per-task raw counter mostly have to do with minimizing total
cost (user + kernel) of collecting this information.  I have this phobia,
perhaps not well founded, that moving critical scheduling/allocation
decisions like this into user space will fail in some cases because
the cost of gathering the critical information will be too intrusive
on system performance and scalability.
A per-task stat requires walking the tasklist, to build a list of the
tasks to query.
A raw counter requires repeated polling to determine the recent rate of
activity.
The filtered per-cpuset rate avoids any need to repeatedly access
global resources such as the tasklist, and minimizes the total cpu
cycles required to get the interesting stat.

Well you should, and well you do.
If you have good reason, or just good instincts, to think that there
are uses for per-task raw counters, then your choice is clear.
As indeed it was clear.
I don't recall hearing of any desire for per-task memory pressure data,
until tonight.
I will miss this patch.  It had provided exactly what I thought was
needed, with an extremely small impact on system (kern+user) performance.
Oh well.
