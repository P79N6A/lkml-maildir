Sorry, but I have to put my 2 cents worth in here..........
I have to say that I use both on different machines, so I am not one 
eyed on this topic.
Having said that, the main reasons (IMHO) that people use ATA/IDE/etc 
are as follows:
* your average motherboard comes with the controller built-in - no 
added expense
* disks are _far_ cheaper than SCSI counterparts.
* (usually) simple setup.
* Is not UDMA supposed to reduce the impact on the CPU load ?
For the average person, the added expense of buying a SCSI adapter 
plus the extra cost of the disks are prohibitive.
Depending on what country you live in, these costs will be different 
but down here in Australia, they are just too expensive.
Sure, you can hang a decent tape drive off the scsi chain but the 
cost there is also rediculous.
I know this is really off-topic but I wanted to point out that the 
costs in various parts of the world do not outweigh the benefits.
Regards,
Brad.

Paranoid, are we?  :-)
It's because IDE is cheaper:  it's really a sort of early Win-device, 
making
the CPU do the work to save on hardware costs.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the 
point.
