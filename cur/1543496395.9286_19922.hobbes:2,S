That was the point. Thank you very much! I really had no idea about that!
Thanks once again!

  If select() set a bit in readfds, and read() on that fd returned zero,
it means that whatever is attached to that fd is finished, this fd
must be closed, and no further i/o should be attempted on it. In your case
stdin is a socket, and other end closed it or disconnected for whatever
other reason.
