Bartek I think the removal is just for reassertion that the
locking is the problem. You can't remove it easly from
blk_stop_queue() unless you make it mandatory that blk_stop_queue
has to be run with the lock already held. Or in other words
basically -> Don't use blk_stop_queue() outside of ->request_fn.
