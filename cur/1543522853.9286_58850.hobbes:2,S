Any device driver that relies on a udelay() call to actually delay for
close to the requested amount of time is likely to be disappointed.
The change when the clock slows down can be larger than a factor of 2.
I'd expect that most udelay() calls are conservatively large or not
actually critical for correct device operation, simply because these
systems do seem to mostly work ok.
I've had a few PCMCIA bug reports related to clock slowdowns.  There
are probably others that I never recognized as such.
