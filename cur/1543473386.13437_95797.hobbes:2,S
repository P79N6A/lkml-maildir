Probably rarely, but fonts that share glyphs among multiple characters
have much sense. Keyboard-to-application mapping is independent from
application-to-screen mapping. There is no reason to restrict inputtable
characters to those that are uniquely outputtable. It gives completely no
advantage and does have bad effects - the only reason is our laziness.

And this is another thing; it could give correct gpm pasting when using
fonts that share glyphs. Unicoded screen buffer is not needed for proper
keyboard translation, but would have its own advantage.
