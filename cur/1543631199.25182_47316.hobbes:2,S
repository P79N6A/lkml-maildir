Simply the desire to batch up the hash table searches for efficiency,
particularly on SMP where we have to take a spinlock before touching
the MMU hash table.  This will be an even bigger win on ppc64 on
partitioned machines where we have to call the hypervisor to make
changes to the MMU hash table.
I'm thinking now that I would be better off doing the batching by
storing a list of virtual addresses needing flushing in the
mmu_gather_t, instead of relying on getting at the special bits in the
PTEs at some time after the tlb_remove_tlb_entry call.
Regards,
Paul.
