I always thought that ACPI was supposed to describe everything that
(a) consumes resources or requires a driver and (b) is not enumerable
by other hardware standards such as PCI.
If that's true, isn't it a BIOS defect if this embedded controller isn't
described via ACPI?
I don't object to this patch, but it seems like the ideal way forward
would be to get the BIOS fixed so you could claim the device with PNP
for future ThinkPads, and the table of OEM strings would not require
ongoing maintenance.
