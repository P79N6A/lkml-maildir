No, you'd rather do that inside the debugging version of spinlock itself.
I see MUST_HOLD happening inside helper functions that presume a lock is
in effect but don't do any on their own to ensure integrity, while
MUST_NOT_HOLD is a matter of forcing ordering and avoiding deadlocks.
Locking order is larger than functions and should be documented at the
point of declaration of the locks.
You can do lock order checking in the spinlock debugging code something
like this:
struct spinlock
{
	atomic_t val;
#ifdef SPINLOCK_DEBUG
	void *eip;
	struct spinlock *previous;
	struct spinlock *ordering;
};
DECLARE_SPINLOCK(a, 0); /* a is outermost for this group */
DECLARE_SPINLOCK(b, &a); /* b must nest inside a */
DECLARE_SPINLOCK(c, &b);
Each time you take a spinlock, record the eip, stick the address of the
current lock in the task struct, and stick the outer lock in previous.
Then see if the current lock appears anywhere in the previous lock's
ordering chain (it shouldn't). This may be a bit overkill though.
It might make sense to have a MAY_SLEEP assert in a few key places (high
up in the chains of things that rarely sleep or for which the call path to
sleeping isn't obvious).
