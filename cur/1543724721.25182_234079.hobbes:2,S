This does not change the normal behavior of the kernel. This only
has effect when you use the cmdline options to increase it.  I only 
use 1/256 of my memory for hashes but there might be someone else
crazier than me that wants more.  Of course the 1/16 number could be
change to something a lot smaller but i should give people some room
to play with.
