I think bonnie++ measures accesses to many small files (INN-like
simulation) and database accesses.  These are random accesses, which
is the worst access pattern for RAID.  Seek time in a RAID equals the
longest of all the drives in the RAID, rather than the average.  So
bonnie++ is domninated by your seek time.
