Notebook drive is plugged streight into a circuit board or connected by a 
short cable. The unlikely possibility for hardware is that it is out of spec 
and it also could be the drive. 
IBM/Hitachi have standalone PCDOS diagnostic floppy disk images and IIRC some
linux based stuff for their drives on their support website. You could run 
this diagnostics and see if you learn more. 
BTW, as it is in a way an  interrupt problem - you tried wo ACPI and  IIRC, 
you have no APIC?
