I considered this very carefully when I wrote the code, but the interface
exposed by it is quite ugly: it really is an internal interface between
the two.

You missed "#include "foo.c"" as a possible workaround.  Note that it's
a waste of disk space, not memory, since these cannot be loaded at the
same time.
