What are you attempting to insinuate?
I think BK had has positive benefits to all Linux kernel hackers, 
whether or not they use BitKeeper.  The current patch flow is pretty 
amazing, and we seemed to have avoided the Linus burn-out that 
threatened to come to pass pre-BK.
It's getting to the point where it seems like every time BitMover does 
something to appease the non-BK crowd, people (a) read evil intentions 
into the action, and/or (b) just keep asking for more.
Can someone please tell what is the overall point?  what is the endgame 
here?  what is a concrete technical solution that will satisfy you 
(Ben), Pavel, and everybody else?
