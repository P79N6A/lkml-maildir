I am using moudle-init-tools-3.1-pre6 with kernel 2.6.9. The new insmod seems have restrictions which failed loading driver module with parameters.
My module parameter is in the form of modname="*************** ****", a quite long one.
Run - insmod modname.o modname="*********** *******" (with a script), it complains about the space and treats the string next to the space to be a "Unknown parameter".
By replacing the space with any character, then it complains 
"modname: string parameter too long"
Same parameter string works fine under 2.4.25 with original insmod.
Is this a bug or new insmod has restrictions? If it is restriction, it will bring a lot of trouble. 
Thanks!
Eddie
