A parallel port network card might be the cheapest that you could get for a
notebook, at least if your looking for a reliable adapter.  Most cheepies
I've seen, including some expensive ones, either overheat themselves,
freeze, break their dongles, etc.  The best one I've seen in the Xircom
realport (dongleless) network card/modem combo, but its price is in the $300
range.
