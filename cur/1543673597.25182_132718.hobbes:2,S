So far I see nothing abnormal. My current top:
09:51:53  up 16:40,  1 user,  load average: 0.02, 0.02, 0.00
56 processes: 55 sleeping, 1 running, 0 zombie, 0 stopped
CPU states:  0.2% user,  0.4% system,  0.0% nice,  0.0% iowait, 99.3% idle
Mem:   124616k av,  114444k used,   10172k free,       0k shrd,       4k buff
        53088k active,              46836k inactive
Swap:   76792k av,    1804k used,   74988k free                   53632k cached
Can you show "top b n1" (unabridged) and "cat /proc/meminfo", "cat /proc/slabinfo"
of the "swap usage shoot up to 95%" event?
