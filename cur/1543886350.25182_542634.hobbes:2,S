It only seems that way.  If afs_prepare_write() is called, but doesn't return
an error, then afs_commit_write() will be called, and it seems that the copy
in of the data will be guaranteed not to fail by the caller.
Furthermore, afs_prepare_page() will have filled in the missing bits.
And whilst all that is going on, the page lock will be help by the caller, so
that no-one else can access the partially complete page.
I suppose I could call SetPageUptodate() in afs_commit_write() instead.
