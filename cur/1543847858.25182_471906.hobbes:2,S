Seeing some strange behavior on my box with 2.6.19-rc1-mm1 on Fedora 
Core 5. (This also has my sata_nv ADMA patch applied, but I doubt it is 
related.) About 30 seconds or so after I finish logging into X, I get this:
do_IRQ: 0.105 No irq handler for vector
and then shortly thereafter, my USB keyboard/mouse start acting 
strangely - keypresses get missed or doubled somehow, and mouse clicks 
don't register. Also, on my first bootup attempt, it hardlocked the box 
at this point.
2.6.19-rc1 and 2.6.18-mm3 (both also with the sata_nv ADMA patch) don't 
seem to have this problem.
Full dmesg is attached.
