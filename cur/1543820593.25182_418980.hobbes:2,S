Subject: [PATCH] LSM: add missing hook to do_compat_readv_writev()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/26/27

This patch addresses a flaw in LSM, where there is no mediation of readv() 
and writev() in for 32-bit compatible apps using a 64-bit kernel.
This bug was discovered and fixed initially in the native readv/writev 
code [1], but was not fixed in the compat code.  Thanks to Al for spotting 
this one.
Please apply.
