'make prepare' is and has always been part of the standard build.
So I really do not see what is going on.
Can you please check that followign files exists in your output
directory:
.config
include/config/auto.conf.cmd
include/config/auto.conf
the latter should be the latest of the three.
Also try applying following patch to reveal why we trigger this rule:
diff --git a/Makefile b/Makefile
index 1dd58d3..4c30ed5 100644
--- a/Makefile
+++ b/Makefile

 	$(error kernel configuration not valid - run 'make prepare' in $(srctree) to update it)
 endif
