No.

We atomically only clear the ones that we are going to execute really. See
the clear_active_bhs implementation. The only thing that matters for UP is
that we take irq disabled all the time after we seen `active == 0'. Thus
we can enable interrupts locally _before_ clear_active_bhs but _after_
get_active_bhs().
>Does it hurt to keep __sti and __cli() in the caller?
No of course, they should be removed (see my previous email ;).
