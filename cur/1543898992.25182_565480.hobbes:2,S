I guess it depends on usage patterns.
I don't remember seeing any such cases, even though I have a permanent
fuse mount, and I suspend regularly.  But the fs is probably totally
idle during suspend in my case.
But some people use fuse as a home or root filesystem and in those
cases it can become quite likely to cause problems.
