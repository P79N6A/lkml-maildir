My primary test box is again out of reach, but meanwhile I was able to
reproduce some kind of problem under QEMU - that one at least is
triggered by SMP. With only one CPU -> all apparently fine. Once booting
QEMU with "-smp 2" -> this happens:
(gdb) tar remote /dev/pts/6
Remote debugging using /dev/pts/6
Not all CPUs have been synced for KGDB
breakpoint () at kernel/kgdb.c:1895
1895            wmb(); /* Sync point after breakpoint */
(gdb) c
Continuing.
Not all CPUs have been synced for KGDB

The problem seems to be related to continuing SMP boxes. I'm able to
boot my box up if I leave kgdb unattached. But when I then later attach
and continue execution, I get the same crash. Any ideas what goes wrong,
any suggestion where to start digging? Maybe at "Not all CPUs have been
synched"?
