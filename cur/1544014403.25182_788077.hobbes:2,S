The range of signed 32-bit times is 1901 through 2039, which has only
one century, 2000, which is a leap year.  So the caveat for leap years
is correct but unnecessary.
So I've discoverd, at least on Ubuntu, something wonderful and
reassuring.  It already works exactly the way I think is correct.  Look:
I create a test timezone with no daylight saving and one leap second:
    davidn@takauji:~/timetest$ cat tz
    Zone testzone 0:00 0 XXX/YYY
    davidn@takauji:~/timetest$ cat leapseconds
    Leap 2008 Dec 31 23:59:59 + S
    davidn@takauji:~/timetest$ zic -d . -L leapseconds tz
Then the test program, which makes a time_t (what time() returns) for a
few seconds before the leap second, then counts off seconds...
    davidn@takauji:~/timetest$ cat timetest.c
    #include <time.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    main() {
            setenv("TZ", ":/home/davidn/timetest/testzone", 1);
            struct tm tm1 = { 55, 59, 23, 31, 11, 108 };
            time_t t1 = mktime(&tm1);
            int i;
            for (i = 10; --i; t1++) printf("ctime(%ld) = %s", t1, ctime(&t1));
            return 0;
      
    }
Observe two 23:59:59's.  Apparently it could be better if the second
23:59:59 was 23:59:60, but I prefer it this way.
    davidn@takauji:~/timetest$ ./timetest
    ctime(1230767995) = Wed Dec 31 23:59:55 2008
    ctime(1230767996) = Wed Dec 31 23:59:56 2008
    ctime(1230767997) = Wed Dec 31 23:59:57 2008
    ctime(1230767998) = Wed Dec 31 23:59:58 2008
    ctime(1230767999) = Wed Dec 31 23:59:59 2008
    ctime(1230768000) = Wed Dec 31 23:59:59 2008
    ctime(1230768001) = Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 2009
    ctime(1230768002) = Thu Jan 1 00:00:01 2009
    ctime(1230768003) = Thu Jan 1 00:00:02 2009
Perhaps this is distribution-dependent, but even so, there's no need for
the kernel to drop the second (and it's wrong if it does.)
