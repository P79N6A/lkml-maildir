Sorry Jens, I never meant to imply I had heard of any since that floppy
bug.  I just understand there were some problems at the beginning. 
Also, I haven't been able to follow LKM as well as I would have liked
lately, but a few months ago, in one of the many IDE bash sessions that
have happened in 2.5.x I read a few people blaiming some of the problems
on interactions between the new block layer and the IDE layer.
Sorry about the worries.  I am just trying to be cautious.  I am
guessing you are saying that the block layer is now solid?   If this is
the case, it sure knocks a few of my worries out of the ball park and I
will be that much closer to trying out 2.5.x myself.
