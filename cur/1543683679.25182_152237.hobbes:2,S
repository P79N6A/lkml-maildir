that's slightly different than what i get without i8042_nomux, and a
keyboard & mouse plugged in, the system crashes and burns badly during
boot.  without the keyboard and mouse it boots fine.
with i8042_nomux it's a lot happier.
my system is a test board for a new processor with the ali1563 -- which is
a newer hypertransport variant of the 1533/1535.  i'm not sure yet if
there are production boards with the 1563.  but it's nice to know it
happens with your 1533 as well.
andries -- i'll send you a copy of the in/out traffic (it's a bit large
for posting).
