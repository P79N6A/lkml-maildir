A problem was raised and Jens answered it. The simple fact is that right
now linux kernel include files are often not suitable to include in user
space.
You are free to do what you like. You can just stick a ifndef / define
at the top of your program to fix it up nicely, or wait for glibc to
include it, or try to include you kernel headers. Please don't be
hostile toward people who are answering questions.
FWIW I think some people are looking at this for 2.7
