You need to "unroll" copy_to_user_ret().  There is no
corresponding macro.  Just test the condition and return
-EFAULT (?; not looking at the source code) if it's invalid.
Don't know about "outs".
__bad_udelay means that some module used a too-large-parameter-value
to udelay().  Linker should be telling you which module.
