2.6.13 hangs on boot on my PowerBook 5.4, reverting the disabled ROM
patch (appended for confirmation) fixes it.  2.6.13-rc7 was fine.

    Ignore disabled ROM resources at setup
    
    Writing even a disabled value seems to mess up some matrox graphics
    cards.  It may be a card-related issue, but we may also be writing
    reserved low bits in the result.
    
    This was a fall-out of switching x86 over to the generic PCI resource
    allocation code, and needs more debugging.  In particular, the old x86
    code defaulted to not doing any resource allocations at all for ROM
    resources.
    
    In the meantime, this has been reported to make X happier by Helge
    Hafting <helgehaf@aitel.hist.no>.
