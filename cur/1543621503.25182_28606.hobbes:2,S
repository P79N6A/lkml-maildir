If so, then fairness of mconfig vs. CML2 tools should command that
mconfig's "old" mode works properly first. I reported to Christoph that
it always reprompts me about the kernel core format (a.out vs. ELF),
which is something "make oldconfig" does not do with the same config, he
acknowledged the bug, but I have yet to see the fix.

Does that really happen? It looks as though the conversion of the
current config.in stuff has been completed as part of the CML2 suite.
