Aaron,
Erik A (code-poet) just informed me that I misread the to/from line and so
I mistakenly replyed to you with the "sarcasim and humor".  I apologize
for my dyslexia and for shooting off the hip to quick thinking it was
"Gigi Duru" making the comments.  Again, apology for not maintaining
site-lock on humor-cannon.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
