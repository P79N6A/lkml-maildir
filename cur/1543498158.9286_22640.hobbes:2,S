      Okay.  "nonstandard today, but soon it will be part of some standard"

      To compile anything?  So if I'm using lcc to build applications,
      I'll just have to toss it and replace it with gcc?   That is, in
      the words of the immortal bard, less than optimal.   (I have the
      same objection to 64-bitification of time_t; I'd much rather see
      time_t become a struct timeval or some similarly opaque type that
      doesn't depend on changing the definition of the C language.)

      Well, that statement I can agree with.  But probably not in the
      way you'd want.

    david parsons \bi/ I've got a few things to say about the existing
                   \/        headers, but that's why G-d invented perl.
