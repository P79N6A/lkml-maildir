Configure.help
==============
In 2.2.0-pre2 there are no entries in Configure.help for many QoS options:
# CONFIG_NET_CLS_ROUTE 
# CONFIG_NET_CLS_FW 
# CONFIG_NET_CLS_U32 
# CONFIG_NET_CLS_RSVP 
# CONFIG_NET_CLS_RSVP6 
# CONFIG_NET_CLS_POLICE 
The help doesn't have to say much, only something along "Please read..."
policy-routing documentation
============================
It would be nice to have a few examples and some more documentation
about the schedulers in Documentation/networking. The current
document, policy-routing.txt, is basically useless for a newbie like
me.  Maybe a reference to a web site and a list of required tools?
(That site is now referenced in Configure.help, but it seems to me
that it would be better to keep the Documentation/* files up to date
and refer to those files in Configure.help)
.config
=======
I said yesterday that CONFIG_MD_BOOT was missing, but it's there
now. Must have been a Y2K-1 related problem. Sorry.
Apropos .config: Wouldn't it be a good idea to ship a .config that has
all "recommended" options set? (ie default is Y when Configure.help
says something like "Answer Y here unless <special case>")
