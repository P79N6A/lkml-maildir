But why? for some applicatioins?
The struct dentry_stat can be modified to have only two useful fields,
and let the other four printed with 0,
I have greped age_limit, that's also not used anymore, why we should
let it keep 45? Or Is there some historical reason?
Or just consider /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state as a binary application interface?
