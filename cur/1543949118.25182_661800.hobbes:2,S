irq affinity masks can basically be thought of as: "these are the CPUs 
where external hardware events will trigger certain kernel functions and 
cause overhead on those CPUs". An IRQ can have followup effects: softirq 
execution, workqueue execution, etc.
so managing the IRQ masks is very meaningful and just as meaningful as 
managing the affinity masks of tasks. You can think of "IRQ# 123" as 
"special kernel task # 123".
