It's a matter of implementation. I don't know if there's any trace of
XFS already, and Linux should not wait for SGI to get their gear cleaned
up and packed. 
Another approach: each journalling file system has its private
structures (which is a duplication of effort, and may lead to subtle
differences between file systems)---though I agree to prefer the unified
approach.
