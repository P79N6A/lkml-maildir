It installs a kernel module just for the video card.  Nothing else.  But
being a kernel module means any bugs in it could mess up other stuff in
the kernel.
Now if you can reproduce the crash without the nvidia module, then you
have something to report.  For what it is worth, it seems the nvidia
module has very rarely been the cause of crashes, but since you can
never tell, it is best to reproduce the problem without it to be sure.
