Yes, it can add a few KB to a kernel image.
Some people could think that it's worth it...especially
if it's a build option.
I prefer this to using /proc/config.gz (which SuSE currently does),
since the config data won't be in permanent memory, and it's
attached to a kernel image on disk -- the kernel doesn't have to
be loaded in memory to view it.  (or maybe there's a way to
view config.gz in a SuSE kernel image ?)
I don't see how making it a binary module (living in
/lib/modules/version/kernel/configs.o e.g.) has any advantages
over kbuild (?) just copying the .config file to
/lib/modules/2.5.4/.config .
Does anyone recall if kbuild already does something like this?
I spent a little time this weekend making .config live in an
__initdata array, and I can see it in 'vmlinux',
but I can't see it in the (compressed) 'bzImage' file.
I expect that this is just a tools problem, due to the
compressed kernel image.  Does anyone know how to grep
for a string in 'bzImage', or how to expand 'bzImage'
so that grep can find strings in it?
