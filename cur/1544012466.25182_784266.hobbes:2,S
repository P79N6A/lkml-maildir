i don`t know, probable few to none on pc/server hardware, but things may 
look different in embedded sector...
btw, here is some real-world data on compression and block-alignment:
kernel 2.6.27.8
                               (du -sk)      (du -sk --apparent-size)
uncompressed          72140         66554
gzip                          29988         25447
gzip -9                      29892         25374
