FYI, there's a new feature in the -V0.7.48-25 (and later) -RT patches 
that implements this: CONFIG_LPPTEST. It is a simple standalone driver 
and userspace utility from Thomas Gleixner that can be used to measure 
the IRQ-latency of the system over a null-modem-parallel-cable.
to use it, enable CONFIG_LPPEST in the .config [disable CONFIG_PARPORT 
first], boot the kernel on both the target and the host systems, and 
then run the scripts/testlpp utility on the host system which will 
measure latencies and will do a maximum-search.
(the driver assumes normal LPT1 PC layout - 0x378/IRQ7)
