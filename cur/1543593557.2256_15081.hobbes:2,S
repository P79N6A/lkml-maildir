 OK. Maybe my wording was implying a nonexisting relation. In any case,
the behaviour I described started with some of the later (-ac12)
versions of 2.4.4-ac and continues with 2.4.5-ac.
 On a side question: does Linux support swap-files in addition to
sawp-partitions? Even if that has a performance penalty, when the system
is swapping performance is dead anyway.
