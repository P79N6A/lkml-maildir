Worked for me, thanks a lot ! The kernel complained about some
unrecognized packet on the first try/tries, but now it always seems to
work.
Linux 2.4.15-pre4 on Sony Vaio C1VN, ColdSync 2.2.3, Sony Clie N710C
upgraded to PalmOS 4.1.
"protocol: simple" yields:
  ##### Bad response ID: expected 0x9a, got 0x93.
  Warning: Restore: Can't delete database "BigClock": -1.
  Error: Can't restore directory.
  ##### Bad response ID: expected 0xaf, got 0x9a.
  Error: Error during DlpEndOfSync: (7) Invalid request ID.
Trying to use ttyUSB1 always yields:
  visor.c: Device lied about number of ports, please use a lower one.
