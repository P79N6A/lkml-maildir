Hmmm...
The PCI spec. says that Limit registers define the top addresses
_inclusive_.
The spec. does not seem to imagine that a Limit register lower than the
corresponding Base register will ever exist anywhere, in my opinion. :-)
This let me think that trying to be clever here is probably a very bad
idea. What is so catastrophic of having 1 to 4 bytes of addresses and no
more being possibly in a forwardable range?
