Coexisting is the base line and I don't think they'll 'interfere' with
each other, per se, but we specifically want to make it easy for
userland to set up and configure scheduling policies to apply to groups
of processes.
For instance, the vserver scheduling extension I wrote changes
scheduling policy so that the interactivity bonus is reduced to -5 ..
-5, and -5 .. +15 is given as a bonus or penalty for an entire vserver
that is currently below or above its allocated CPU quotient.  In this
case the scheduling algorithm hasn't changed, just more feedback is
given into the effective priorities of the processes being scheduled. 
ie, there are now two "inputs" (task and vserver) to the existing scheduler.
I guess the big question is - is there a corresponding concept in
PlugSched?  for instance, is there a reference in the task_struct to the
current scheduling domain, or is it more CKRM-style with classification
modules?
If there is a reference in the task_struct to some set of scheduling
counters, maybe we could squint and say that looks like a namespace, and
throw it into the nsproxy.

Let's keep it the technical dialogue going for now, then.
Now, forgive me if I'm preaching to the vicar here, but have you tried
using Stacked Git for the patch development?  I find the way that you
build patch descriptions as you go along, can easily wind the commit
stack to work on individual patches and import other people's work to be
very simple and powerful.

I just mention this because you're not the first person I've talked to
using Quilt to express some difficulty in producing incremental patchset
snapshots.  Not having used Quilt myself I'm unsure whether this is a
deficiency or just "the way it is" once a patch set gets big.
Sam.
