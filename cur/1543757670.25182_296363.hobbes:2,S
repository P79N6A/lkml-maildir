And said watchdog would clean up the mess, how, exactly?  There's lots of sticky
issues having to do with breaking locks and possibly still-pending I/O (I once had
a tape drive complete an I/O 3 *days* after the request was sent - good thing no
watchdog killed the process and deallocated the memory that I/O landed in ;)
It's been covered before, look in the lkml archives for details.
