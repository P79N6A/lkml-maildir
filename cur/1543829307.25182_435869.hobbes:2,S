Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: another fix for canonical RIPs during signal handling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've been reported by the PaX Team that the following fix left a
small hole :
[PATCH] Always check that RIPs are canonical during signal handling
+	if (regs->rip >= TASK_SIZE && regs->rip < VSYSCALL_START) {
+		regs->rip = 0;
+		return -EFAULT;
+	}
...
+	if (regs->rip >= TASK_SIZE) {
+		if (sig == SIGSEGV)
+			ka->sa.sa_handler = SIG_DFL;
+		regs->rip = 0;
+	}
"the wrong part is regs->rip=0, i guess the intention was to cause a
 SIGSEGV upon returning to userland, but 0 is a valid userland address,
 an application may very well have something mapped there. the correct
 value would be ~0UL as it's guaranteed to fault on linux."
This explanation makes sense, so here's the patch. Andi, would you please
review and confirm ? Thanks in advance.
