I believe Alan's tree had 32-bit quota support, which requires a
different version of quota-tools. If you return to Linus's tree, your
original version will work. 
For what its worth, Linus has finally merged much of Alan's tree into
his own, and is pretty much done as of 2.4.15-pre.  32-bit quotas were
_not_ merged.
