I like Alexanders idea better and will give it a good try. If the
speed steps down slowly but shoots up 100% quickly (as it is right
now), even a small task (like opening a folder, or scrolling down in a
document) will cause a tiny spike to 100% which takes a while to go
back down. The result is that the CPU spends most of it's time at 100%
or calming down. I wrote a small test program on my notebook which
confirms this.
It's either or. Either you go up AND down slowly (which I would
prefer), or you go up and down immediately. But spiking up and slowly
going back down is not a good combo.
Alex has my vote, even so I have to give if some more testing.
Cheers,
