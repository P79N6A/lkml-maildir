Just a gentle reminder that Ms. Walsh is not an SGI employee
and that any opinions she may express regarding the Linux
development process are her own, and may not reflect the
views or understandings of SGI or any other individuals
involved.
In particular, dragging SGI into this discussion is
inappropriate and unnecessary. SGI is currently not
active in this effort, and makes no claims regarding
it's appropriateness to any particular purpose.
Please leave SGI, in spirit and name, out of
this discussion.
