Well, I got an auto-reply from andrea saying he wasn't reading email until
July 5th (yeah, I've gotten other mails since then, we all know how
that goes ;-) 
The orig email I had regarding the patch was he thought some 
of the page lists were getting corrupted, leading to someone trying to free
a page that didn't exist anymore.  This was a recent discovery, I don't
think the patch is even in an aa kernel yet ;-)
Since Xuan's stack trace had things waiting in deactivate page, it sounded
similar to the problem andrea described.  We had a few test boxes
hanging under load, they are testing the patch now, plus Xuan, plus
one other l-k user.  If their problems go away, we'll have to dig to
find the exact corruption.
