How about just fixing CIFS to submit memory page by page? The network
stack below it supports that just fine and the VFS above it does anyways, 
so it doesnt make much sense that CIFS sitting below them uses
larger buffers.

My understanding was that the deal was that order 1 is supposed
to work but somewhat slower, and bigger orders are supposed to work
at boot up time.
