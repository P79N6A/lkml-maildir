In which case, consider whether we should be tainting the kernel if
someone loads a device driver, it binds to a device, and then they
unload that driver.
It's precisely the same situation, and precisely the same mechanics
as what I've suggested should be going on here.  If one scenario is
inherently buggy, so is the other.
