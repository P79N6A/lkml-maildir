I suspect that even with your patch below, there is the posibility
to receive an unintentional call into pcmcia_parse_events() from some
socket drivers.  The all round better fix is to make pcmcia_parse_events()
ignore socket change events until the socket thread is up and running.
Nevertheless, the patch looks correct, so I am still interested in
whether your patch helps solve Michael's problem.
