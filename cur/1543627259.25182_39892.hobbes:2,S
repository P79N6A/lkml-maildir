Dear Mrs Abacha (if that is your real name, which I doubt)
I think that all of your problems would go away if you installed Rick
Hohensee's l33t forth module and rewrote your kernel in java.
Futhermore, I am a sucker.  I'd really like to give you my bank details so you
can take all of my money and possibly kill me on the promise of fabulous ilicit
wealth.
Please email me at bite_my_shorts@uncarved.com and visit my website at

Cheers
Sean Hunter
