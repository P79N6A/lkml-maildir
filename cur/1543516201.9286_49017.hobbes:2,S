Not a bug. It's your responsibility to run the 'rpc.statd' daemon if
you want to use file locking over NFS. This needs to be done on both
the client and the server.
If your distribution doesn't have this program, then you can find the
rpc.statd daemon in the knfsd package (which has recently been renamed
to 'nfs-utils'). See
