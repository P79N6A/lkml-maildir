I know you think that, but I disagree. Yes, it's slightly less
convenient for a small handful of older drivers, but in the general case
it's a massive improvement -- because now we can have a single canonical
location to collect _all_ the firmware that is redistributable, for use
with the kernel. And we've already started adding a whole bunch of new
firmwares to that repository.
