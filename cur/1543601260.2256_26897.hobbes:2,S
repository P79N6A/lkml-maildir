I'm not sure I understand why this is here?  If we are talking about a
multipath situation, there IS only a single disk, so which path is chosen
is mostly irrelevant.  Also, it is my understanding that with some multipath
hardware, if you read from the "backup" path it will kill access to the
primary path (this can be used when more than one system access shared disk
for failover).  As a result, we should always read from the "primary" path
for each disk unless there is an error.
Cheers, Andreas
