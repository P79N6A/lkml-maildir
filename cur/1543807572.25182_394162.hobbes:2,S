Spreading might be useful for this, but it is not what is driving my
interest in it.
My immediate goal is to obtain spreading across the nodes within of a
single cpuset, running a single job, not "fairness between projects."
I have little interest in cross (between) project memory management
beyond simply isolating them from each other.
