This is a pagecache page and other CPUs can look it up and play with it. 
The __SetPageReadahead() is quite wrong here.
And we don't have a reference on this page, so this code appears to be racy.
You could fix that by taking and dropping a ref on the page, but it'd be
quicker to take tree_lock and do the SetPageReadahead() while holding it.
This function is too large to inline.
