This is a known problem of all Linux stackable file systems.  Users are
not supposed to change the file systems below mounted stackable file
systems (but they can read them).  One of the ways to enforce it is to use
overlay mounts.  For example, mount the lower file systems at
/raif/b0 ... /raif/bN and then mount RAIF at /raif.  Stackable file
systems recently started getting into the kernel and we hope that there
will be a better solution for this problem in the future.  Having said
that, you are right: failing the branch would be the right thing to do.
Nikolai.
