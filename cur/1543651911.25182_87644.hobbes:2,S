Subject: EXT2 corruption -- After running 2.5.46, my root partition cannot be mounted by older kernels

Hi,
I am not sure how to diagnose the problem.  When I try to boot
the latest RH 8.0 kernel, I am informed that some unsupported
extensions are present on /dev/hda12 at boot time.  The partition
fails to mount and the boot process halts.
I have no trouble booting with 2.5.46.
