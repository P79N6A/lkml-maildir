You can use (GNU-)tar for this. It even keeps track of other bits like
ext2fs attributes, AFAIK.

Yes, I would consider this "selfish" ;-)

This could then be solved with union mount and cramfs mount over
ramfs or any other writable Unix style fs.
Then we might need W bits, but currently they disturb things like
"test" and the perl equivalent, which is quite annoying and
complexifies code.  (Yes, I'm selfish too ;-))
See what Linus and Al think about this.
