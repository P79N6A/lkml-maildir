I'd have to crack open a ThinkPad battery to know for sure, as well.  That's
why I used "some sort of embedded controller"...  I am operating on
second-hand data.
Still, stuff like

gives me some hope the battery packs have some good stuff in it.

Try a ThinkPad, they are a bit better than that :-)   Of course, you have to
disable (or properly configure) stuff that tries to outguess you and are not
really enabled to talk to ThinkPad specifics like what comes with KDE and
GNOME, if you don't want to get surprise suspends.
I am not sure how better a recent ThinkPad (T42 or newer) behaviour would be
by your standards, but still...

Well, all of mine come with "made in Japan" seals from Sanyo.  I sure hope
this means the cells themselves are not from some third-party with shoddy
quality control and manufacturing processes.
