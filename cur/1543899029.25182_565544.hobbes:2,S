Don't panic .. they're not ... we have a pointer to the gendisk in our
SCSI structures (properly refcounted).  The reason is historical and
actually goes back to 2002 when we first got rid of the static arrays of
structures we used to keep around.
Doug ... don't think 'disk' when you see 'gendisk' just think of it as a
useful infrastructure library.
