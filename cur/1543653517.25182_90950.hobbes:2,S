# Usage:
# kernel src located in:

# compile in:
# ~/compile
# cd ~/compile   <= Change to the directory where the compile shall take place
# ../kernelsrc/kbuild

# Arguments to kbuild is the same as used to make in the kernel build
# kbuild prints out SRCTREE and OBJTREE when started, and then makes a mirror
# of relevant files from the kernelsrc.
