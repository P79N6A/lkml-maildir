My point was, it's not inherently necessary in order to use MMCONFIG. 
I'm not saying the checks (unreachable_devices and 
pci_mmcfg_check_hostbridge) aren't useful or needed with many real 
machines. However, in the event that type1 access isn't available we 
just skip all those checks because we have no other option. It would 
indeed be a pretty broken spec if there was no way to bootstrap with it 
even under ideal conditions..

I can't really disagree that MMCONFIG doesn't have great advantages for 
most devices (though it likely is faster on a lot of platforms, which 
may be significant if the device does lots of config space accesses). So 
for the moment, avoiding using it except where necessary will likely 
work out (except if some system does indeed puke on mixing type1 and 
MMCONFIG).
However, what Microsoft is doing with Vista may eventually make a 
difference in the future. Many hardware vendors seem to use the testing 
strategy of "test with latest Windows version. Works OK? Ship it." If 
Vista decides that MMCONFIG is good to use all the time, then type1 
access support is likely going to a) end up less tested and b) probably 
deleted entirely in time. We've seen it before - it used to be that not 
using ACPI was the safe option on most hardware with Linux. Now you 
pretty much have to use it because the manufacturers only test with it 
enabled. I've seen at least one board where the interrupt routing was 
completely broken with ACPI off, because they obviously only tested in 
Windows..
