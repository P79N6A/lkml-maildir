Sure, I didn't expect it to solve the problem. But as a general advice,
hardware monitoring drivers are better selected as modules than
built-in.

Ah, OK. Sorry, I got confused.

Hint: increase the fan clock dividers to 4.

Ah, interesting. Could it be that the gnome applet quits because it
fails to get the adapter name? That wouldn't be very smart, but that's
possible.
This is a side effect of an i2c-core cleanup. This is already fixed in
lm_sensors 2.10.3 (libsensors.so.3.1.3). Care to give it a try and
confirm it fixes the problem? Note that it might be a bit tricky to get
the gnome applet to use your own libsensors rather than the system one.
You might need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable before
the applet starts, or something similar.

Irrelevant to your problem, but you most certainly need neither - else
they would have been selected automatically.
