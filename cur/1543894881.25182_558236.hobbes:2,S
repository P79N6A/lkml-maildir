It was actually meant semi-seriously in that drivers/ata sits on top of
the abstract parts of drivers/scsi which James keeps asking for someone to
get split properly off and which would sort all these out.

If your slices don't fit the PC worldview you might want to look at
dmraid and just use device mapper to handle them. It is a lot more
flexible and we could actually bin all our partition code and use this
but for back compatibility.
