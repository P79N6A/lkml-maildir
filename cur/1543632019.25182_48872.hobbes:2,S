Hello, 
 I just got a Sony DSC-P71 digital camera (wonderful), but it doesn't
seem to be working in linux. I beleive it uses the usb mass storage
driver, it seems to use an equivilent driver in windows. I have scsi,
usb, usb mass storage modules all loaded. 
dmesg after I load the usb-storage module, and then plug the camera in:
Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...
usb.c: registered new driver usb-storage
USB Mass Storage support registered.
hub.c: USB new device connect on bus1/1, assigned device number 3
scsi0 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
I am useing devfs, and /dev/scsi is empty.
cat /proc/bus/usb/devices:

All this happens regardless of NVdriver being loaded or not.
If someone with one of these cameras or the nearly identical DSC-P31
could help me, it would be appreciated
Colin
