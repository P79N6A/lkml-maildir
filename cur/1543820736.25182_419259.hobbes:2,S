That is just a compiler barrier (barrier()). A CPU should always be 
consistent with
itself so memory ordering doesn't really apply there (hence smp_ prefix, 
which also
are compiler barriers, of course).

Well you're only looking at i386. True it is i386 specific code, but 
sticking
to the Linux memory model is more clear and consistent I think.

Yes, and make part 1 use smp_wmb.
