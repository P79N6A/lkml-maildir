GNU diff doesn't seem to understand soft links, so I don't think that's
feasible unfortunately. The ../mach-default stuff still requires you to
edit each subarch's makefile when adding a file to any subarch, which is
a pain in the butt, but better than the duplicated files by a long way.
Another comprimise solution for now might be to leave the Makefile entries
with ifdefs in the main Makefile (just as we do without subarch), but just
move the subarch files into the subarch dirs ... at least until we get a 
better plan sorted out? That'll mean much less reshuffling when it's fixed.
