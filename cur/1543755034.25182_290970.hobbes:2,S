One thing which comes up in this instance is: what struct device should
be used.
With ISA devices doing DMA, the device which actually "owns" the DMA
is the ISA DMA controller, not the device wiggling its DMA request
signal to the ISA DMA controller.
Given that, shouldn't the ISA DMA code have its own struct device to
represent the ISA DMA engine for things like the floppy driver and
other drivers using the ISA DMA engine?
To me, it makes no sense to pass the ISA device wiggling its DMA request
into the DMA API - this ISA device doesn't care whether the ISA DMA engine
can only access the first 16MB of memory or not (which is ISA DMA engine
specific), so the DMA mask on the ISA device is rather meaningless.
(This type of DMA also appears on later ARM platforms as well, hence
why I have given the whole issue some thought.)
