In a driver I wrote I setup (for a newly allocated skb and a 2.4 kernel):
	some_header = (struct some_header *) skb_push(skb, sizeof(struct some_header));
	skb->nh.raw = (unsigned char *) some_header;
	this_eth_hdr = (struct ethhdr *) skb_push(skb, ETH_HLEN);
	this_eth_hdr->h_proto = __constant_htons(ETH_P_SOME_HEADER);
	memcpy(this_eth_hdr->h_source, dev->dev_addr, ETH_ALEN);
	skb->dev = dev;
        skb->protocol = __constant_htons(ETH_P_CSM_ENCAPS);
	dev_queue_xmit(skb);
where some_header for you is probably an IP header and dev is the "struct 
net_device" of the device you are using to send the packet out on the 
wire.

First you need to get the device, then the MAC address is easy. This 
should be what normal IP routing code does...
