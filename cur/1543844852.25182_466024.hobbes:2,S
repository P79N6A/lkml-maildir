If I understand correctly, you just need to get rid of that bad commit?
Can you copy the missing files (in the suitable tree structure) to
/tmp/missing/ and try this?
	cg-admin-rewritehist -r EVILCOMMIT \
		--tree-filter 'cp -r /tmp/missing/* .' \
		--commit-filter \
			'if [ "$GIT_COMMIT" = "EVILCOMMIT" ]; then
				shift;
				while [ -n "$1" ]; do
					shift; echo "$1"; shift;
				done;
			else
				git-commit-tree "$@";
			fi' \
		fixedbranch
(s/EVILCOMMIT/thesha1id/)
Now check if fixedbranch looks ok.
