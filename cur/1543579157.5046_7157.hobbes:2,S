I think this would be the best solution as well.

Don't forget about the idle task also. How is this done? By reintializing
the semaphore.

By you saying couldn't be acquired from interrupt context do you mean
from a process context or do you mean it failed to aquire it while in 
the interrupt context?

This wouldn't be to hard to do for VTs using the fact that keybaords 
are not initialized right away. As for serial consoles well that is
another story. Of course we could have this flag set/cleared in
start_kernel.

You already developed the framework for this.

Good luck.

What about multidesktop systems? I have vgacon and mdacon working fine 
along each other. Each one has their own tasklet to allow them to work
independent of each other. Meaning no race condition when both VC switch
at the same time.

Don't forget the idle_task case as well. exit path?
