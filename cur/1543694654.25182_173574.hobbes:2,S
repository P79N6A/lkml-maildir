Eric, is it true what we tell users, that if a drive can't remap a bad 
block it has probably used up all its spares, and that in turn means 
that it is wise to buy a new one because the chance of experiencing 
additional data corruption on a drive that has used up all its spares is 
much higher than the average drive?
What are the common sources of data corruption, is one of them that the 
drive head starts bumping the media more and more often because a 
bearing (or something) has started to show signs of wear?
