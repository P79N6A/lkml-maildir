Hi guys!
I am shure that someone has already face the problem like this. I installed
RedHat 5.2 from CD, then recompiled the kernel. New kernel boots, but
doesn't
want to mount root filesystem. Error message looks like:
VFS: Cannot open root device 03:01
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:01
03:01 are numbers of device hda1, major and minor.
In the same time, the original kernel, which come with the distributive,
boots normally, mounts all needed and works. Maybe it's because of LILO
misconfiguration (LILO is installed in the MBR) or because of the large size
of my hard disk (more than 1024 cylinders, but /dev/hda1 fits in 1st 1024),
i don't know. If someone know how to cope with it, answer please.
Alexander
