Subject: hang with 2.4.26 copying to loopback device

I'm running a vanilla 2.4.26 kernel (on a rather old distro, Mandrake
9.0).
I have large (6GB) file on a remote NFS server (running 2.4.18), on
which
there is a file system that I'm mounting via loopback.
When I copy to this looped back filesystem, I get a hang after a few
megabytes. After the copy hangs, I move the cursor around and soon X
freezes as well. I can, however, reboot via sysrq.
I've seen several reports a couple of years ago of deadlocks in
loopback, but nothing recently that I can find via searching.
Is there anything currently known to be an issue, or should I start
preparing a proper report?
