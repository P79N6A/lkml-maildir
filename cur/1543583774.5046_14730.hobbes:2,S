Umm.. all the printk's are inclosed with the ifdef, courtsey of a little

maintainer), and when I want it to shut up, it shuts up.
Are you sure you recompiled and installed properly?  Re-ran 'make dep'?
I've had reports of this before -- every one of them was solved by a proper
recompilation.

We've made a business out of making money from annoying and stupid people.
I think you fall under that category.
