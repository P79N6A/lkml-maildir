	I've had the (dubious) opportunity to write a C++
kernel module for Linux 2.2.x earlier this year for a client.
(Code is at:
http://www.smartdisk.com/Downloads/Software/flashpath-0.2.1.tar.gz
 )
	Anyway, here's my two cents:
	* If you have to port a C++ codebase to run in linux,
	  rewrite it in C.
	* If you can't rewrite it in C (politics, size, time, etc)
	  make a C++<->C API translation.
	* All kernel calls must go through the translation
	* Use the minimal C++ runtime in flashpath-0.2.1/linux/cppfake.c
	C++ is ugly as kernel code. I do _NOT_ recommend starting
a new project with it. However, if you're porting alien C++
code, it can be done. And it's not pretty.
ObWackyKernelLanguage: Objective C
	If people are interested, I can whip up an Objective C
runtime for the kernel. Will be slow as molasses compared to
C, but should make for interesting driver modularity (and flame wars)...
