It dates back to before the merge. It should have been posted to lkml
by Zwane.

I can't answer this directly. Basically, if ppl are merging workarounds
for ancient compilers, my expectation is that operational semantics
specific to newer compiler versions (or specific architectures) can't
be assumed. I'm not the one making the calls as to whether the
requirements (compiling out completely on UP, compiling to no indirection
on small SMP) are relaxed or if "new enough compiler" meets them.
