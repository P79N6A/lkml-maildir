There are a couple of options for implementations to use that don't 
require space for a spinlock: a hash table of spinlocks can be used 
to protect the data (parisc uses this technique).  Andrea's lockless 
reader locks could be useful in this case.  Most x86es can use cmpxchg8, 
and the 64 bit machines are already set.  I suspect it would be a useful 
addition to the kernel APIs.
