Subject: "Fix" broke PPP filtering

There was a changeset that went into Linus' tree on 9 April with the
title "[ISDN]: Fix kernel PPP/IPPP active/passiv filter code",
attributed to kkeil@suse.de.  The change to ppp_generic.c in that
changeset means that the active-filter option in pppd no longer
works.
Why was the change to ppp_generic.c made?
Paul.
