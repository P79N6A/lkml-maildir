Umm, no.  We're describing how it works on Linux.  That doesn't mean it
only can work on Linux.
The libc-dependent code movement which has been going into mainline is part
of making UML use VT (Intel hardware virtualization support), where the
runtime environment is different enough that it makes sense to handle this
as a port to a new OS.
There was also a nearly complete Windows port a few years ago which has
bitrotted since.
