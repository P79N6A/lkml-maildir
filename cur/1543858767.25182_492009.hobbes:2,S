Btw, this doesn't apply to my git tree at all (just pulled):
Hunk #1 FAILED at 35.
Hunk #2 FAILED at 94.
Hunk #3 succeeded at 145 with fuzz 1 (offset 39 lines).
Hunk #4 succeeded at 242 with fuzz 2 (offset 82 lines).
Hunk #5 FAILED at 315.
Hunk #6 succeeded at 435 with fuzz 2 (offset 96 lines).
Hunk #7 FAILED at 497.
Hunk #8 FAILED at 802.
5 out of 8 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file
Documentation/CodingStyle.rej
Is it against -mm or something such?
