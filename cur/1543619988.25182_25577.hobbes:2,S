A really useful patch makes all the options appeared in /proc/config.gz. It's 
used by SuSE kernels among others (mine, too :)
You can find the patch on kernelnewbies.org (don't remember where exactly)
zgrep CONFIG_PROC /proc/config.gz
	will give you the answer.
I have absolutely no clue why such a useful things is not integrated into the 
kernel yet. It's even useful for such things as "build a kernel using the 
same options as I have on current kernel but I don't know where my .config 
is".
FWICS It seems harmful to me.
