Marvell tend to not have a one true firmware, but one for each device, so you might end up having to dig out the ones shipped with the device.
Still, my understanding is that the device won't boot the helper firmware until it is entirely loaded, so that shouldn't be the problem.

Your problem is here. The card chokes for some reason and times out when it's supposed to receive a chunk of the firmware. Odd, as the loading loop first queries the card if it is ready for more data.
You could try adding a delay to the helper firmware loading loop (if_sdio_prog_helper() in if_sdio.c). Add an msleep(100); in there and see if that gets things further. Loading will be slow as hell though.
