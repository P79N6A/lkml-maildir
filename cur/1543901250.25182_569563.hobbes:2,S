Ok, after applying the latest kexec patches, I was able to use the kexec'd 
kernel to suspend to ram and resume to the normal kernel, while working 
under a full-blown X session.  It went without a hitch.  All that is needed 
now are the dump/restore hibernation-image routines.

Using a modular kernel you would only insmod those modules that you need to 
dump the image, which is mainly the diskdriver.  If you wanted to dump it 
onto USB flash, then you would insmod that driver, and if that driver is 
slow due to a bug, then a fix should be in order.

Agreed, but what we want to achieve right know is a proof of concept.  Later, 
I could imagine a specially stub'd device driver to be kexec'd instead of 
the full kernel.
Thanks!
