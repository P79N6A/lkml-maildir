That's what the wrapper which you deleted, was doing ;-)  So yes, I like
it.  It just raises one new problem, endianess - are arguments being passed
as low/high or high/low?  On MIPS we've been solving the issue with the
merge_64() macro which is defined depending on the byte order:
#ifdef __MIPSEB__
#define merge_64(r1, r2) ((((r1) & 0xffffffffUL) << 32) + ((r2) & 0xffffffffUL))
#endif
#ifdef __MIPSEL__
#define merge_64(r1, r2) ((((r2) & 0xffffffffUL) << 32) + ((r1) & 0xffffffffUL))
#endif
The actual syscall wrapper could use it like:
asmlinkage int compat_sys_pwritev(unsigned long fd,
       const struct compat_iovec __user *vec,
       unsigned a3, unsigned a4, unsigned long vlen)
{
	loff_t offset = merge_64(a3, a4);
...
If merge_64() was a standard macro in <asm/compat.h> on all architectures,
compat_sys_pwrite() could invoke it directly and the need for the compat
wrapper around the compat wrapper would go away.

Same as 32-bit MIPS for argument #4 and up which will be passed on the
stack - but the requirement for passing a long long is for it to be
passed as an aligned pair of arguments and the original patch got
that wrong.
