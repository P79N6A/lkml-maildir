I meant sata_via, I dunno why I said sata_sil; Freudian typo.  I was 
thinking of the current sii3112 I use, which has been stable and 
blazingly fast for awhile with the IDE driver--and a little little patch 
I keep applying.  I'm looking to upgrade a server with 2 Raptors in it 
to an A64 running 64-bit Linux of course.  I wanna get the HDs off the 
PCI bus and onto the VT8237 southbridge.  I was wondering if the driver 
for -that southbridge- was still considered beta.
