Ahh.. it's the unlocked subsequent dump calls that are _still_ running
when the destroy is invoked. That's where Patrick and I went wrong
when we tried to fix this issue. We set our t0 to qdisc_destroy and
didn't really consider any prior unlocked tasks still running.

It's not completely useless, it speeds up the deletion classful
qdiscs having some depth. However, it's not worth the locking
troubles I guess.

I think it's pretty clean but it doesn't solve the problem completely,
see below.

qdisc_destroy can still be invoked without qdisc_tree_lock via the
deletion of a class when it calls qdisc_destroy to destroy its
leaf qdisc.

I will look into this.
