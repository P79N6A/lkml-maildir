I was just compiling kernel2.0.36 on my 486 DX2/66 linux system and
got this message:
make[1]: *** Warning:  Clock skew detected.  Your build may be incomplete.
I was compiling across an nfs shared volume, weather this makes a
difference or not..
system is a 486 DX2/66 - 16meg RAM - running off a 170meg IDE hdd and a
727meg SCSI hdd.
running 10meg eathernet with nfs over it to the drives on my other box (a
p166)
the p166 is using kernel 2.2.1 
Anyone seen this kinda error?
