Please boot a 2.4.9 system with "aic7xxx=verbose" in your lilo.conf
(aic7xxx driver statically linked into your kernel", or:
options aic7xxx aic7xxx=`"verbose"'
in your modules.conf (you'll have to recreate the initrd for it
to take effect) if you are loading a module.  Use a serial console
to capture all messages from the start of boot through several
reported errors, and send it to me.
