Documentation might be a good thing, indeed. I doubt <asm/io.h> is the
right place for it, people tend to look at other drivers etc to pattern
after (as clearly showed by how often a bug in one place is replicated in
lots of other places ;)
We've actually fixed a number of these things - there are drivers that
notice removal on their own silently, and just turn it into a no-op.

Most people don't unplug their devices while they are in use, and on
cardbus the most common case ends up (I think) being the fact that the
cardbus PCI static interrupt itself is shared with the device interrupt.
So what happens is that when you remove the CardBus card, that causes the
cardbus controller to send an interrupt (for removal), but since that
interrupt is shared with the card driver, the card driver also sees the
interrupt even if the card itself is otherwise idle.
This meant that some tulip cards at least were _guaranteed_ to lock up
some time ago, simply because their interrupt handler would loop forever
on seeing the "more work" bit continually (all bits in the status register
were set due to the removal and floating data lines).
