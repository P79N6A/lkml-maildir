Well, my intention was to write it based around being used for kernel
bugs, and let others modify it for their needs, (and presumably
Bugzilla was based around being used for reporting bugs in a web
browser).

Interesting - so the first stage in reporting a bug would be to select
the latest 2.4 and 2.5 kernels that you've noticed it in, and get a
list of known bugs fixed in those versions.  Also, if you'd selected
the maintainer, (from an automatically generated list from the
MAINTAINERS file), it could just search *their* changes in the changelog.

I'm prepared to have a go at it.  This _is_ my kind of area - most of
my income this year has come from writing web-based database code :-).

Were you doing boring things with large computers before then?  :-)
:-) :-).  Sorry, I'm being silly now :-).
