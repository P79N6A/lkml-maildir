Current News
Goldmark Industries, Inc. (GDKI - News), a rising Urban Entertainment force, is pleased to announce that the Company has enhanced its Executive Leadership with the addition of accomplished artist, Frost, as Vice President of the Music Division. Frost is very well respected by already established act and is looked at as a role model by up and coming talent. He was the pioneer of Latin Hip Hop, which has exploded, with the extremely popular, Regaetton over the past 4 years. Frost will serve as an ideal Vice President of Music Operations within Goldmark, due to his extensive musical knowledge, skills, history and experience. His presence on the Board of Executives will only serve to be advantageous to Goldmark's overall growth.
Frost -- originally known as Kid Frost -- was a pioneer in the field of Latin hip-hop, cutting some of its very first records and helping to bring exposure to other bilingual MCs. Pioneering Latino rapper Frost only gets better with age. The veteran East Los Angeles rapper, who became a hip-hop icon in 1990 with his groundbreaking single "La Raza" has stepped up his game in the last decade, sharpening his lyrical skills and becoming an authority figure in the rap world. His success allowed such Latino rappers as Cypress Hill, Fat Joe, Big Pun to make substantial hip-hop inroads.
His music features a hard-hitting mix of hard-core hip-hop, smoothed out cuts for the ladies and laid-back songs for cruising. This versatility is one of Frost's strengths, something that keeps him fresh. "The thing keeps my name in people's mouths is that I keep reinventing myself," Frost explains. "I don't just keep on making the same music I want to take bilingual hip-hop a trend I was the forefront of one step further while still kicking vivid rhymes about the code of the streets with authenticity."
Frost is an original and knows about originality. Rapping since 1980 Frost scored his first record deal with Electrobeat Records thanks to the help of his long time mentor and frieend Ice-T. When deciding on his name, Frost decided to model his moniker after that of the man who helped start his career, choosing Frost since Frost comes before ice. Then known as Kid Frost, Frost became a regular on the car show circuit in the mid 1980's. When he released "La Raza" and his debut album, "Hispanic Causing Panic" a few years later, his visibility exploded and helped the Lowrider culture thrive in Southern California and eventually Worldwide.
Frost says, "As I see the KRS-Ones and the LL Cool J's still in it, I won't budge. A lot of people might say that I'm too old. But I don't think it's your age or how you rap. It's your rap skills that keep you in the game. As long as we make that knocking Chevy music, we're going to stay in this rap game."
Frost is a more than welcome addition to Goldmark's Board of Executives.
This is one decision that is easy as it is profitable

She's a mother hen.   Under the weather. When pigs fly.  Walking on water. The squeaky wheel gets the grease.   Up one side and down the other.   Stubborn as a mule.   Scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Up a tree. You have to separate the chaff from the wheat. Sour as a green apple.   Survival of the fittest.   We hung them out to dry.  Say it with flowers.   Putting the cart before the horse. When it rains it pours.   As uneasy as a cat near water.  
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.   A rolling stone gathers no moss. A tree does not move unless there is wind.   A snail's pace. The scythe ran into a stone. Strong as an ox.  A weed is no more than a flower in disguise.  Turn over a new leaf. Stuck in a rut.  Timber! Wait and see.  The sharper is the berry, the sweeter is the wine. Till the cows come home.   Stop, look and listen. Top of the morning.    Slow as a snail.   Want my place in the sun.
