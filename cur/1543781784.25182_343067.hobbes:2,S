Actually, I believe they should be using pthread synchronization
primitives instead of relying on Linux-specific functionality.
Glibc already uses futexes internally, so it's almost as efficient.
I've already suggested this to the OpenLDAP people, but with
my limited knowledge of slapd threading requirements, there
may well be a very good reason for busy-waiting with
sched_yield().  Waiting for their answer.
