I'm just about to go off on holiday, and don't have a chance to pull up 
all the relevant standards details at them moment.  However, I'm fairly 
sure that the signal handler should be called.  (Try running a modified 
version of my program on Solaris 10 or the Unix-03 conversion of AIX 
(5.3?).)

Yes, I'd say the behaviour should in fact be like what sigsuspend() does.
