this _must_ be changed before v2.6.24 is released. Thomas Bächler, 
Thomas Gleixner and me already wasted hours on this problem, and these 
kinds of issues will reoccur again and again - in perhaps even more 
spurious ways.
Picking up randon environment details during build reduces 
reproducability (i couldnt reproduce the problem using the exact same 
toolchain) and might break various existing setups and distro builds as 
well.
At minimum the extra CFLAGS needs to be put into the .config - but 
that's not a too nice solution either. How about just adding an 
extra-CFLAGS option to .config and perhaps a 'make configpickupCFLAGS' 
pass for anyone who wants to propagate the environment CFLAGS into the 
kernel build.
