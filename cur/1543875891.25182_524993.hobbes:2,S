I have a pxa255 based system with PCI added to it.  The e100 would have 
memory corruption in its receive buffers detected by slab debugging 
unless I put in the patch to use the S-bit.
Here is a link to the patch posting:

Search for e100.c.

 - This discussion seems 
to hit the issue.
There appears to be a race on the cache line where the EL bit and the 
next packet info live. In my case the hardware appeared to write to a 
free packet.  The S-bit seems to make the hardware stop and spin on the 
bit, while the EL bit seems to let the hardware try to use that packet.
This race would occur less often when the receive buffer chain is always 
refilled before the hardware can use them up.  On our 400 Mhz Xscale, we 
can use up all 256 buffers if the PCI bus has another busy device on it. 
  In our case it is an 802.11g miniPCI card and our software was routing 
all ethernet packets to the wireless interface and vice versa while TCP 
streams were running accross these connections.
