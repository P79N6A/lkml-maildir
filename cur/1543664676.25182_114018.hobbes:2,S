Andrew Morton said "iget5_locked() looks simple enough, and as far as I can
tell does not change any existing code - it just adds new stuff.",
also this code (in its 2.5 incarnation) was tested in 2.5 for long time already.
Also it fixes real bug (and while I have another reiserfs-only fix for the bug,
it is fairly inelegant).
Bye,
