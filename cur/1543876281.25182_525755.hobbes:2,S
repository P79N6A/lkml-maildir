Hello,
I have just tried booting the fc7-rc2 live cd on 2 of my laptops and it 
failed on both.
Laptop 1 is an asus vbi s96f that get a panic that says exception in 
interrupt routine
for my rtl8139.
This device works fine in 2.6.20.2

The other laptop is a hp n5430 it fail in the ali-pata driver not being 
able to read the cdrom, timeing out
and dropping into a bash shell telling me to tell it where the root 
filesystem is. Also it sets my hard
drive to udma/33 when it run find at udma/66 under 2.6.20.1. It would 
really be nice if the people makeing
all these changes would at least keep things compatible with what they 
were before. These are regressions
guys!
This hp n5430 system works fine with 2.6.20.1.
Hope this stuff gets fixed.
