Indeed, do it in user space. But don't use ioctl unless it fits the
problem better than the other solutions. Use read / write on a device
file, or a special purpose file system, or sysfs, or even /proc. The
exact mechanism you should use depends on the nature of the user space
- kernel space communications.
