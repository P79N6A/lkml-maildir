Good - no doubt that means that my update is superfluous already.
Let me see..
Hmm. This new file documents barrier=1 and I did not.
Does that really apply to ext2?
Otherwise the changes agree, except that I documented that since
2.5.46 most defaults are not determined by the kernel but by the
superblock. (So some *'s should be deleted.)
(Will not send a new patch now. Maybe later.)
