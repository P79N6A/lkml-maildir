They are two  3Com 3c905B Cyclone 100baseTx cards, btw.

Question: I thought the APIC was very important for SMP and SMP
performance. Would the machine still work as SMP with noapic (well, I can
just try, I know).

Yes, No. In more detail: The machine is a firewall/virus scanner for a
company network. It worked 100% reliably, however a 300MB iso image
download triggered the problem repeatedly. Right now I cannot reproduce
the problem anymore. However, it seems bandwuitdh to the internet is
currently a bit slower. You said it's related to the IRQ frequency. The
machine serves a 2Mbit internet link only. I'd guess its normally not
stressed enough. Except with this long relatively fast (~1.5Mbit when it
crashed) download.
