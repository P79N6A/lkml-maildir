Hmmm yes. The 'Pixel PLL not locked' message happens in the middle of
take_over_console(), so if I do something stupid like trying to debug
using printk instead of GDB, I get...
<7>take_over_console starts
<7>take_over_console calls save_screen()
 <crash>
... but if I make the Pixel PLL message KERN_DEBUG too, it continues...
<7>matroxfb: Pixel PLL not locked after 5 secs
<7>take_over_console calls update_screen()...
<4>Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 160x64
<7>take_over_console ends

Indeed -- it won't crash _today_ if I do that.
But the problem is not recursion -- the problem is that there is a time
window during which _any_ printk (which could be from a timer or
interrupt) would kill the box, because it seems the console is getting
registered and allowing output before the hardware is fully initialised
and ready to accept it.
I don't know whether you consider this a bug in the generic console
code, or a bug in matroxfb -- but removing the 'Pixel PLL not locked'
message is only a workaround which serves to mask the real problem, so
I'd advocate leaving it in for now until the problem is fixed correctly.

The hardware _was_ completely uninitialised before matroxfb started,
certainly. 
I'd sort of expect it to have been initialised before we attempt to
register it as a console device though -- and even if it's OK to
register a partially-initialised device because the console registration
is supposed to perform the final initialisation by setting modes, etc.,
then I'd _still_ expect it to be initialised before the console code
actually lets any printk() through...

Once during boot and never again.
