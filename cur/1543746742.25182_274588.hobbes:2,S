The problem with the
cat /etc/passwd/..metas/contents/shell[username = "joe"]
syntax is that it doesn't really achieve namespace unification.
As far as I understand the benefits of a unified namespace are due to
the user and the applications not having to know the details of what
they are dealing with. So, for instance, the nice thing about the
unification of files and devices in Unix is that an application (most
often) can treat a device in the same way as a file (or a pipe, etc.).
This is what gives it real flexibility.
The above syntax assumes you know exactly where the file "ends", and
where the parts of the file "begins" (indicated by the ..metas in your
path). Couldn't we get rid of ..metas from the path?
Also, what I am suggesting is not just to be able to select inside XML
files but also to extend XPath-like selection ABOVE the file level too,
to be used as if the whole file system was like a single big virtual XML
file.
