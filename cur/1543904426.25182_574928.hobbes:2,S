We don't *need* it but some people still want to use old IDE and the
author was willing to make it neatly compatible so that anything that
works with the pata_platform should be able to use the ide_platform
driver and vice versa. For the shorter term that can only be a good thing
- arch code doesn't need to care about which driver is used, end users
can pick and it doesn't end up adding new ties between code and old IDE.
