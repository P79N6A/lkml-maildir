Hi,
	Is there a way to turn off nagle compression in the kernel for 2.2.x
and 2.4.x kernels? For the same custom app used under Solaris and Linux.
Turning off nagle algorithm boosted perf on Solaris, I tried commenting out
#bool 'IP: Disable NAGLE algorithm (normally enabled)' CONFIG_TCP_NAGLE_OF
from the net/ipv4/Config.in 2.2.19 kernel and still the degradation in
network performance for packts in midsize persists
I tried the 2.4.16 kernel. This gave me very slight improvement, but not
quite what is expected.
TIA
Zameer A.
