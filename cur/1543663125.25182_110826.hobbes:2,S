All you are showing us Neil is that the documentation
is inaccurate.  That snippet you showed me from manual
pages is wrong about sendmsg semantics.
The ifindex you specify does mean "send out this interface".
It is very surprising that this documentation is wrong since
the likely author (Andi Kleen) is smart enough to read the
actual implementation when he writes these things.
And yes, this means, no accurate documentation exists currently.
