Great idea.  We can help in the following way: BitKeeper has an extremely
simple test harness used for regressions.  It's well thought out in that
it is trivial to write simple tests and run them in isolation or to 
run the whole suite.  If you want the harness, we'll give it to you 
under whatever license you want, I assume GPL, but we don't care.
You can see what the tests look like in BK, if you have it installed, we
ship all the tests, they are in `bk bin`/t
A simple test might be
	#!/bin/sh
	# test that touch creates a file
	touch foo
	test -f foo || {
		echo failed to create foo
		exit 1
	}
The harness takes care of putting you in a clean isolated environment.
