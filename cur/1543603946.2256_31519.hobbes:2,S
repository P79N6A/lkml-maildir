Hmmm... would you say the "siglongjmp" method is better than the "self-pipe"
method for a select on both file descriptors and signals too?
As far as I can see the trade-off is (in the non-race-condition case)
between having to call read() on the pipe (to empty it after receiving the
signal) for the "self-pipe" method and having to call sigsetjump() every time
before one enters select/poll.
My assumption would be that the "self-pipe" method is cheaper... right?
Then somebody mentioned using signals to wake up processes
for frequent events wouldn't be a good idea at all - why?
And what could be a better alternative given that there are N processes,
which all need to be able to wake up any of the other N-1 processes - where N
is big enough to prohibit dedicated channels between each possible process
pair, and given that it has to be a portable way that does not impose
the risk of leaking files to a disk?
