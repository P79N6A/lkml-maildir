Don't do it this way.
Instead, put the string printout in the _trap_ handler, and make the
format of BUG() be something like this:
	#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE
	#define BUGSTR "\"" __FILE__ "\""
	#else
	#define BUGSTR ""
	#endif
	#define BUG() \
		asm("ud2\n\t.word __LINE__\n\t.asciiz " BUGSTR)
and then have the trap handler print out the pretty-printed version.
The advantage of this is:
 - much smaller footprint even when messages are enabled.
 - no register corruption
 - easily extendible (ie we can put a "bug code" etc, and have the trap
   handler do different things depending on the code)
Ok?
