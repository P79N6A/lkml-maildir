Here's a new version that adds smp_call_function_single(), and moves the
code that's shared with smp_call_function() to __smp_call_function().

Add an smp_call_function_single() to the powerpc architecture. Since this
is very similar to the existing smp_call_function() routine, the common
portions have been split out into __smp_call_function(). Since the
spin_lock(&call_lock) was moved to __smp_call_function(),
smp_call_function() now explicitly calls preempt_disable() before getting
the count of online CPUs.
