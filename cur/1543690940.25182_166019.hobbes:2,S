Definitely not specific to 2.6.0-test5: I have
repeatedly seen 2.6.0-test4 crash this way too.
Whether I have had this vulnerability for days or
weeks or months or years I am not yet sure, I do not
customarily make a point of trying chvt much with each
new kernel.  
Unless I hear otherwise, hopefully within hours, when
next I manage to visit my console in person:
1) I will test to see if the script can crash:
2.6.0-test4 with my near default .config
2.4.22 with my near default .config
2.4.21-xfs Knoppix booted via cd
2) After the reboot following a crash of 2.6.0-test5 I
will sample:
lspci -v
/var/log/dmesg
X version and driver info from /var/log/XFree86.log 
.config
3) I will report back here, attaching (2) as .tar.bz2.
