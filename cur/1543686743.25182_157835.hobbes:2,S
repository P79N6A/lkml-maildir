Sigh..
I posted a proof of concept patch for discussion on $SUBJECT. In that
patch, I removed the folding for the purposes of having a reasonable
comparison between cryptoapi and native. Cryptoapi does FIPS-180-1 and
thus does twice as much hashing on 512 bits. Removing the folding was
a convenient and obvious way of addressing it for the purposes of
discussing $SUBECT until a good way to work around the extra padding
was found. I've already indicated my willingness to accept your
SHA-may-be-backdoored-and-somehow-leverageable argument, so can we
kindly discuss $SUBJECT instead of this trivia?
As for "screwing with /dev/random", it's got rather more serious and
longstanding problems than speed that I've been addressing. For
instance, I'm pretty sure there was never a time when entropy
accounting wasn't racy let alone wrong, SMP or no (fixed in -mm, thank
you). Nor has there ever been a time when change_poolsize() wasn't an
oops waiting to happen (patch queued for resend).
And frankly, given that my local version of /dev/urandom does 18MB/s
without starving /dev/random, I see no reason to reinvent strong PRNGs
in userspace for most applications.
