Originally to: All
I use a 3Com 3c509 which I have used okay under 2.2.20. However when I compiled abd installed 2.4.18, the card was no longer available. The card was installed via the 3Com utilty disk, and auto set, 
which gave it settings of io 0x210 and IRQ 10. To use under 2.4.18 I have to boot dos, change it to io 0x200 and irq 7.
Okay, this is not major but I have heard of others having problems with the 3c509 driver.
