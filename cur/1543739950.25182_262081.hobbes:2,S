[PATCH] PCI: Reorder some initialization code to allow resources to be proper allocated.

Yes, I agree. The problem is there isn't a straightforward method for
it. It possibly is hard to get it.

Original PCI assign resources code is the last 'subsys_initcall'
according to the makefile, so move some code of it to 'fs_initcall'
(just below 'subsystem_initcall') should be ok. As you said, ACPI and
PnP is linked before chr/mem.c. The method requires all other
'fs_initcall' don't touch PCI resources, since
'pcibios_assign_resources' is a 'fs_initcall' and maybe don't run, but
it looks ok currently. Again, I will be appreciated if we can find a
solution to make the ordering explicit.
