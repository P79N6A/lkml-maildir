   No.
   In common cases there are no BH's to run and since the dynamic BH's are always
ran from the old-style ones, the old-style test done in shedule() is enough
and it costs only three i386 instructions. Where do you see room for any
significant improvement?
   About coexistency of old-style and dynamic BH's: please note that there
exist multiple dynamic BH queues which are ran under different circumstances.
   [On the other hand, we have a similar situation with old-style timers and
they are IMNSHO really obsolete and should be removed some day.]
				Have a nice fortnight
