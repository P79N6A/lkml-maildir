The code is general enough that it can be used for a variety of
purposes, not just ext2/ext3, although granted at the moment only ext2
and ext3 are using it.  Also, having two copies of the code bewteen
the ext2 and ext3 directories is undeseriable.
Probably the right thing to do is to add the appropriate logic in
fs/Config.in so it's only enabled when necessary.

Oops.  Nice catche.  I didn't notice since it's only used in the
mb_assert code, which I hadn't enabled.
