Literally, yes. But look at it from a s/w engineering point of view.
A NULL pointer deref is important, but it is also a *very local* and
very obvious fix (one that doesn't need extensive testing, one that
doesn't have effects spread out over many modules that requires great
amount of thought).
So such things are trivial bug-fixes.
