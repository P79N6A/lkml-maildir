Many implementation do this with a search and retry the search 
(if clever with a goto and a flag variable to save kernel size)
after module loading.
All that implemented in the search routine, which you have to
supply anyway.
So try_then_request_module() will consolidate the the
branch or in the worst case just duplicating that code
everywhere (depends on wether you implement it as a non-inline
function or define).
Usally this is all as simple as:
   int module_loaded_flag=0;
retry_with_module_loaded:
   
   /* search code */
   
   if (!module_loaded_flag && !found) {
      module_loaded_flag=1;
      if (!request_module(bla))
         goto retry_with_module_loaded;
   }
   return found;
which is very space effecient and also still readable.
