Thanks, I'll look at it.
But I think that we currently re-invent the wheel:
every driver implements it's own version of assert(), #if 0, SMB_PRINTK(),
BUG(), PAGE_BUG(), ftape-tracing.c [a complete .c file just for trace
support], every other scsi-driver has it´s own do_trace,...
e.g. ncpfs always calls assert_kernel_locked(), but the function seems
to be a nop in release builds - just wasted CPU time.
I think that we should collect this code and add a new
#include <linux/kdebug.h>
perhaps <asm/kdebug.h> so that we have an implementation that every
driver can use (based on CONFIG_ASSERT for time critical operations
and/or a sys_ctl for the rest.)
So far I would include
    kassert()
    dprintk()
//    test macros for syncronization objects
        kassert_down(sem)
        kassert_locked(spinlock)
        kassert_kernel_locked()
into this file.
BTW, has anyone checked the missing synchronization I posted?
a simple kassert_kernel_locked() in the main ext2 entry points
would quickly eliminate such bugs.
