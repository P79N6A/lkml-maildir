The tda7432 module of linux version 2.4.18 does not use floating point
anywhere and a cursory review of the code shows no place that any
reasonable person should have substituted anything in later versions.
The (CONFIG_VIDEO_BT848) also includes msp3400.c. This source-file
defines a macro that uses floating-point to convert a constant. It's
possible that your gcc is "saving" the conversion to run-time, which
it shouldn't.
