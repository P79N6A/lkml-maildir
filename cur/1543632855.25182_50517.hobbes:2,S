OK, I've tried the above fix on 2.4.17, and it seems to work.  Thanks Andi.
We can now get into the box on a high priority console after provoking a
lockup with a lower priority, CPU hogging realtime process.
Are there any potentially negative consequences of this fix, apart from
those already mentioned?
I certainly vote for this feature being preserved, as it is extremely useful
for debugging realtime priority apps.  FYI, we narrowed it down to breaking
in either 2.4.10-pre11 or pre12. 
Cheers
Ian
