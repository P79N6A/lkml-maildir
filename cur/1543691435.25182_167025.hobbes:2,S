I need to treat a large number of pages (about 128) as continuous.  However, I 
need to DMA to that memory from a device.  The device has a built-in 
scatter-gather feature, so I don't need to worry about whether the pages are 
physically contiguous.  Looking through LXR revealed a  function called 
vmalloc_32.  My questions are these:
(1) Is vmalloc_32 going to stick around for a while?
(2) Is it appropriate to vmalloc_32(512<<10) and then grab the underlying 
addresses for DMA?
(3) If it *is* appropriate, what's the proper way to get to those underlying 
addresses? I saw a virt_to_page macro somewhere...
