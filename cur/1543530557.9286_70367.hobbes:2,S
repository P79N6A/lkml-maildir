It is very hard for me to deal with bug reports for PCMCIA in the
2.3.* kernel tree.  Partly because the 2.3.* code doesn't work with my
laptops.  But also because I can't tell if bugs are specific to 2.3.*
or are general PCMCIA driver problems.  It would be very useful for
you to determine if these problems are specific to the 2.3.* tree, or
if they also occur with a stable kernel and the latest stable PCMCIA
driver package.  And then I'd want to see comparisons of system log
messages with the old drivers and with 2.3.*.
There are some new D-Link DFE-650 cards that require some special
transceiver tweaking at initialization time.  I don't have a general
solution yet, partly because I don't actually have one of these cards
yet.
