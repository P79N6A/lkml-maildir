splice() is a single synchronous function call, and it's signature still
managed to change wildly during it's development.
In this brave new world of always stable kernel development, the time a
new interface has for public testing before a new kernel release is
drastically shorter than the old unstable development series, and if
nobody is documenting how this stuff is supposed to work and
demonstrating how it will be used, then mistakes are bound to slip
through.
