To be fair the problem should be known:

I hoped the discussion about cancel_rearming_delayed_work would
reach more people (there was also a patch proposal to add a warning
to the usage comment). But it seem it was not enough...
Of course such a problem should preferably be fixed by somebody who
knows the code (alas I don't know netconsole), to be sure all needed
cancels are still done after this change. I hope Jason's patch is
right but I'm a little surprised I can't see netdev in cc (I'll try
to fix this).
Cheers,
Jarek P.
PS: I'm very sorry for such late response (holidays).
