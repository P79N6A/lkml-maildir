hi
i have the following problem with kernel 2.4.0 (also with -ac6):
when trying to connect two isdn channels (/dev/ttyI0 and /dev/ttyI1) 
both initialized with "AT &E123 &L123 &R9600 S19=0 S0=1"
i get after "ATDT 123" (123 stands for my number)
kernel BUG at slab.c:1095!
invalid operand: 0000
CPU: 0
......
(if you need the other numbers or anything else, ask me, i can reproduce 
it easily)
syslog shows (with isdnctrl verbose 3):
isdn_net: call from 0987123,7,0 -> 123
isdn_net: call from 0987123 -> 0 123, ignored
isdn_tty: call from 0987123, -> RING on ttyI1
than the crash
(987 stands for the area code)
my system:
redhat 7.0 (kernel compiled with gcc-2.96, egcs-1.1.2 and gcc-2.95.1 
same result with each of them)
isdn-card: avm fritzcard pnp
btw, it is working with 2.2.17 and the avm driver on suse 6.4
