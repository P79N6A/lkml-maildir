It isn't that bad when you're only building a few files at a time -- I
wouldn't suggest doing it for the whole kernel.
And you get a nice progress indicator at the moment -- a new warning
about global register variables every time it eats a new file, due to
GCC PR27899 :)

We want --gc-sections (which requires -ffunction-sections
-fdata-sections to be useful) but that's a separate issue. We were doing
it a long time ago for the FR-V kernel; Marcelo has been looking at it
recently for other architectures.
