In Con's defence, I think he meant io scheduler starvation and not
process scheduler starvation. Otherwise the following wouldn't make a
lot of sense:
"Unfortunately it is now busy starving the scheduler in the mean time,
much like the 2.5 kernels did before the deadline scheduler was put in."
In indeed, 2.5 kernels had the exact same io scheduler algorithm in 2.5
as 2.4.20-rc has, so this makes perfect sense from the io scheduler
starvation POV.
There are inherent problems in the 2.4 io scheduler for these types of
work loads, the ugly and nausea-inducing read-latency hack that akpm did
attempts to work-around that.
Andrea is obviously talking about process scheduler, note the numa
reference among other things.
