Sounds reasonable to me.  I've proposed in the past that sched_clock
should be scaled by the cpufreq frequency to achieve the same effect
(ie, measure the actual number of cpu cycles that are really available
to tasks).
But more specifically, what you've described is exactly analogous to
hypervisor stolen time, since one thread steals time from the other.

That's how I interpreted it.  You're only credited for sleeping if
someone else wanted the CPU in the meantime.
