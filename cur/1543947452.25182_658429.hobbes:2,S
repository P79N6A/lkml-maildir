Subject: [PATCH try #1] Kconfig: cleanup usr/Kconfig help descriptions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/22/545

Modify the help descriptions of usr/Kconfig for clarity, accuracy and consistency.
This patch mostly clarifies what INITRAMFS_SOURCE does, i.e. optionally
build a CPIO archive of the initial root filesystem (initramfs) and
compress it and link it into the kernel.  Note that usually the initramfs
is separate, and loaded by a bootloader (and I give a list of the common
ones, for clarity).
Correct the filename of gen_init_cpio.c and clarify that any filenames
specified contain lists of directives for the archive builder, rather than
files to be added directly into the archive.
Improve grammar on INITRAMFS_ROOT_UID and INITRAMFS_ROOT_GID and
use consistent terminology.

I think I might be starting to get the hang of this :-)
