Understood, new patch attached, that removes most of the additional failure to
check return code cases.  I've left the cmm_start_thread case and the
rfcomm_init cases as is, because the cmm_start_thread case is called
asynchronously from a work queue, fired from a timer, meaning we cannot
propogate the error to prevent the module from loading, and the rfcomm_init case
does precisely what you ask, in that it detects a failure to start the kernel
thread, and fails the module load if the thread creation fails.
Thanks & Regards
Neil
