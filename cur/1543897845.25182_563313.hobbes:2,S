That's a little misleading. Always dangerous getting your information
from slashdot. Let's say Intel clarified some corner 
cases in TLB flushing that have changed with Core2 and not everybody
got that right. I wouldn't say it was a Intel bug though.

On newer Linux 2.6 yes. On 2.4/x86-64 you would need in theory the microcode 
update too.  (it'll probably show up at some point at the usual place 
http://urbanmyth.org/microcode/
).  Linux/i386 is always fine.
But the problem is very obscure and you can likely ignore it too. If your 
machine crashes it's very likely something else.
