Jeremy,
CONFIG_XEN (in 2.6.23) depends on X86_CMPXCHG and X86_TSC. This
precludes enabling the option in kernels using M386, M486, or M586, despite
the fact that the detection code doesn't need these features and if Xen is
present the features are implicitly there. At least the X86_TSC dependency
can thus be dropped in my opinion, which would then only exclude M386
kernels. (Dropping X86_CMPXCHG may yield build problems, but could
perhaps also be eliminated by forcibly #define-ing it in the relevant source
files.)
