I think the question should be, what are you fellows doing wrong?
From onboard 2 year old via chipset, athlon at 1450mhz real:
[root@coyote root]# hdparm -tT /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.69 seconds =185.80 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.15 seconds = 55.42 MB/sec
[root@coyote root]# hdparm -tT /dev/hdb
/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.69 seconds =185.00 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.07 seconds = 30.89 MB/sec
[root@coyote root]# hdparm -tT /dev/hdd
/dev/hdd:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.71 seconds =181.07 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.40 seconds = 45.62 MB/sec
