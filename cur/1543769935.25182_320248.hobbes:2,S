Not readlink, but actual dereference of link will give you exactly the
vfsmount/dentry the file was opened on.  If you want to bind/move
whatever on that mount, that's possible, even if it's a "detached
tree".

No.  Obviously there must be limitations on which process can access
/proc/PID/fd.  It's obviously safe to allow 'self' for example.  But
any process you can ptrace should also be safe.

Why is that dependent on the interface?  The /proc interface already
allows _everything_ you want to do with file descriptors.  Only the
the necessary restrictions should be worked out.

Yes.  And I think that can be done without any new magic ioctls.  Just
with mount/umount and /proc.
The implementation is another question.  I'll look through your
patches to see how you achieve all this.
Thanks,
