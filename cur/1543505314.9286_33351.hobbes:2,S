Hello!
I'm using Linux-2.2.10/i386, but I can try a newer version if necessary.
My problem is purely cosmetical.
The kernel prints the following line during the boot:
hdc: [PTBL] [1027/255/63] hdc1 < hdc5 hdc6 > hdc2! hdc3 hdc4 < hdc7 hdc8 >
fdisk reports for the same disk:
/dev/hdc1             1       255   2048256    5  Extended
/dev/hdc2   *       256       498   1951897+  a5  BSD/386
/dev/hdc3           499       511    104422+  82  Linux swap
/dev/hdc4           512       766   2048287+  83  Linux
/dev/hdc5             1       128   1028097   83  Linux
/dev/hdc6           129       255   1020096   83  Linux
You can see two defects:
1) The DOS-style extended partition is printed without any sign denoting
its role, while the BSD-style partition name is followed by '!'
2) The children of the DOS-style extended partition are printed
immediately after their parent, while the children of the BSD-style
partition go to the end.
