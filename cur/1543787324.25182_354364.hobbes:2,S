You may want to re-download this one if you got it already, I just fixed
a bug in the calculations of the CPU control loop. It's now getting
results much more consistant with OS X. I still have to add some
overtemp handling and I'll remove the debug stuff and work on supporting
the PowerMac9,1 desktop model.
