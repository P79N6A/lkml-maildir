That was in fact the original plan, before Rafael changed over to
calling prepare() just prior to suspend().

Your analysis is right.  Removal isn't a problem; we don't care if 
drivers are prohibited from registering new children when they are 
unbound.  In general we want to make it possible to unregister devices 
at any time during the suspend-resume procedure (except of course that 
a device can't be unregistered while one of its methods is running).
An important point I tried to make in the earlier email is that drivers
will want a simple way to know when it is illegal for them to register
new children.  For example, suppose the registration is done by a
workqueue routine.  The most reliable way for the driver to insure that
the routine won't try to register new children improperly is to have
the routine check a flag which gets set _before_ prepare() is called.
This means there would have to be _two_ flags: one set before calling 
prepare() and one set afterward.  Only the second would be checked by 
the PM core when deciding whether to allow new child registrations.

That's up to the individual driver.  If it wants to wait until its 
complete method runs, then fine.  But if it doesn't want to wait, the 
PM core shouldn't force new registrations to fail.
