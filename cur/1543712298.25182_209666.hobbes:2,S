It is not only that, there can be also data corruption:
- The  "always return -EFAULT" one is a little bug, so you can discard the 
first and third hunk which fix that; anyway, it was Andrew Morton who noticed 
that, so I've no idea (I agree with you but I'm a kernel newbie). Note I 
posted a 2nd version of the patch which fixes a bug in the third hunk (see at 
the end).
- BUT in the hunk below (the 2nd in the patch), without the patch, the var 
"wrote" can be == -EFAULT and WE CAN DO
		p += -EFAULT, 
                buf += -EFAULT;
so that we can read, afterwards, some bytes of junk from buf - EFAULT and put 
them into p - EFAULT, *corrupting memory* !!!!

        if (p < (unsigned long) high_memory) {
+               ssize_t written;
+
                wrote = count;
                if (count > (unsigned long) high_memory - p)
                        wrote = (unsigned long) high_memory - p;
-               wrote = do_write_mem(file, (void*)p, p, buf, wrote, ppos);
+               written = do_write_mem((void*)p, p, buf, wrote, ppos);
+               if (written != wrote)
+                       return written;
+               wrote = written;
                p += wrote;
                buf += -EFAULT;
Fix in the second version of the patch, for the 3rd hunk:
- Fix this line:
+                              unwritten = copy_from_user(kbuf, buf, len);
+                              if (unwritten != len) {
					[... error handling]
to this:
+                              unwritten = copy_from_user(kbuf, buf, len);
+                              if (unwritten != 0) {
					[...error handling]
