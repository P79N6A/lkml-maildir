A few issues with 2.2.0pre2
COMPILATION ERROR
=================
When I compiled 2.2.0pre2 I got
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/bugs.h:354: `smp_found_config' undeclared (first use
in this function)
and compilation was aborted. I saw this was reported before.
CPU SPEED 
=========
On the old P90 the kernel says 
   Detected 90206697 Hz processor.
   Calibrating delay loop... 35.94 BogoMIPS
Not many BogoMIPS/Hz that.
Missing CONF_MD_BOOT
====================
make oldconfig/menuconfig seems to be missing CONFIG_MD_BOOT, which is
used by md.c to enable the stuff documented in Documentation/md.txt
It works fine if added to the .config with echo >>
Almost nothing was recompiled if you change .config by doing a echo >>
.config, which surprised me. I had expected almost the entire kernel
to depend on .config. I guess this missing dependency is intentional.
PPP
===
RedHat 5.2 is shipped with ppp 2.3.5 which is the version that is
required in Documentation/Changes. However, it seems that is has
to be recompiled with rpm --rebuild before it works with 2.2.0pre2.
(It worked fine with 2.1.122 without recompiling.)
Perhaps add something about this to Changes?
