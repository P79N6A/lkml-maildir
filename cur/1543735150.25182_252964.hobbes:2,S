Hi.
Here are two patches for the driver model, which have been in use in
suspend2 for around a month.
The first provides support for keeping part of the device tree alive
while suspending the remainder. This is accomplished by abstracting the
dpm_active, dpm_off and dpm_irq lists into a new struct partial device
tree, and providing functions to create new device trees and move
devices and their parents between trees. The current API for suspending
and resuming devices is completely unchanged by this patch. New
functions provide the extra functionality and existing functions are
wrappers that work on the default tree. Suspend2 uses this to keep the
storage device and graphics driver alive while putting other devices to
sleep at the start of saving the image.
The second patch adds a helper for finding a device_class given it's
name. This is used to locate the frame buffer drivers and (in
combination with the above patch) keep them alive while suspending other
drivers.
Regards,
Nigel

Many today claim to be tolerant. True tolerance, however, can cope with others
being intolerant.
