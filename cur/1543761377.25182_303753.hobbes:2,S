I noticed a similar problem a few days ago. The ChangeSet,v file
contained the logs but there were no files with the corresponding
(Logical change ...). A day later, the files corresponding to those
logs were updated. I initially blamed the non-atomicity of CVS and
rsync but, reading your e-mail, the problem might not be that simple.
BTW, is there a way for the ChangeSet,v file to be updated after all
the source files are updated (to avoid the empty patch problem if
rsync'ing when the BKCVS repository is updated)?
