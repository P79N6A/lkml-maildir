so "C" is just a processor then - or is it a programming language?
depends on how you look at it. I think that first it's standardized
semantic - this is the more important thing for an implementation.
the preprocessor is just the common way of implementation, right?
I don't want to argue, but I think modularization and OO are quite
different. of course - everybody is free to define OO for himself...
