Sorry, I don't have anything in particular, just bits I've picked up
talking to CF manufacturers.
Basically, a CF card is a flash ROM array attached to a little
microcontroller with an IDE interface.  The large manufacturers generally
have custom controllers.
A basic block diagram is on page 3 (physical page 19) of the
CompactFlash spec, available from
