I wonder what happened of the AIX approach: define a new signal (they
called it SIGDANGER AFAIK), ignored by default, and send this signal
to _all_ processes a few seconds before starting to SIGKILL processes.
This moves the policy completely to user space (i.e. The Right Thing).
You can either have a daemon listening to this signal and deciding by
configuration what and how to kill, or you can implement a handler for
graceful exit in suitable applications, or both. Make the "few
seconds" tunable by sysctl and all is perfect. You can even implement
the following: when a process explicitly ignores the special signal
(and has an appropriate capability?), cause it to never be killed.
That would be for X servers and session managers.
