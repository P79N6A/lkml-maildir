That peace of code used in many places, thus, i've mentioned F8, if
wrong kernel on wrong computer was launched.

As additional note to Andi and many of you, who will say, that it's
a couple of asm instructions, just send patch.
I'm see many kinds of reboot functions in include/linux/reboot.h.
There even reboot_fixup.h. Some of them may be copy/pasted in place of
that while(1) loop, who knows which exactly? What problems it may cause?
I used to write PC bootloaders with tasm, when i was a child
(10 years ago). Nothing major, ok with that.
But i bet, i will spot whitespace and tabification issues in files,
i will visit with emacs and eventually making patches with that. First
ever try with top Makefile failed, this makefile have something after
tabification, that Andrew Morton's makefile (from FC5) doesn't like.
Funny. Don't call me bureaucrat, but this is (my) mater of *not* being
kind of dumb.
