Hello,
This patchset was originally from NIIBE Yutaka.
These patch update the m32r kernel for a new bootloader "m32r-g00ff".
The "m32r-g00ff" has been written and developed by NIIBE Yutaka,
and released under the GPL from 
http://www.gniibe.org/.
So far, it supports two types of booting operations,
CF boot and Network boot (HTTP boot).
* CF boot - boot from CompactFlash or Microdrive(TM)
  We can boot a kernel from CF device.
  To make use of m32r-g00ff, we just put a first stage IPL(initial program
  loader) into a flash memory, and a secondary bootloader into CF media device.
  Currently, LILO-21.4.4 can be used to write m32r-g00ff into the boot sector
  of CF device on a cross development environment.
* HTTP boot - boot via network with HTTP protocol
  By using m32r-g00ff, we can download and boot a kernel image from 
  a web-server.  The m32r-g00ff downloads a kernel image from a given URL,
  resolving the webserver's IP address by DNS.
  As a preparation, we just place a secondary bootloader binary and
  a kernel image on the webserver.
