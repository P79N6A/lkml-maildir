Actually way back when versions were generally standard across the
the different software programs a .x increase was considered major
feature enhancement, while .0.x was considered interim bug fix
releases. Full version increases were generally left for what most
considered _full_ rewrites and major overhauls.
The increase from kernel 1 to 2 saw, iirc, ext2, elf, and a slew of over
changes. It generally changed the way we ran Linux. 2.2 is a great
achievment but we still run it the same as before, just faster, with
more cpu's, more supported hardware...you know, features :)
