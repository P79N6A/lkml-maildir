Fine with me. I had the fast path in mind, but with some
luck, CPU branch prediction will work for us.
I sent out the full patch set, which moves the code from
vanilla to the code we've been shipping since 7 months.
And I made the changes in the order to make the ones that I
expect the least controversial come first.
If we can't find consensus for patches 4 and 5, I'd still
think applying 1 -- 3 is useful.
