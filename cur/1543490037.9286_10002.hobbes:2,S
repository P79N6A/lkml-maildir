With 2.2.3 
mkdep.c and split-include.c won't build on a vanilla RH5 system.
I'll admit I'm not totally sure what the chain of errors is that results in this,
but does mkdep really NEED   
map = mmap(NULL, mapsize, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0); ??
which means it includes
#include <sys/mman.h>
Which doesn't exist on the system I was building on.
I'd have thought a prerequisite for these tools would be "system header independence" ?
Yes, I can work round it, I just don't think I should have had to.
Thanks
Peter
