Subject: [PATCH][RSDL-mm 0/7] RSDL cpu scheduler for 2.6.21-rc3-mm2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

What follows this email is a patch series for the latest version of the RSDL 
cpu scheduler (ie v0.29). I have addressed all bugs that I am able to 
reproduce in this version so if some people would be kind enough to test if 
there are any hidden bugs or oops lurking, it would be nice to know in 
anticipation of putting this back in -mm. Thanks.
Full patch for 2.6.21-rc3-mm2:

Patch series (which will follow this email):
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/staircase-deadline/2.6.21-rc3-mm2/
Changelog:
- Fixed the longstanding buggy bitmap problem which occurred due to swapping 
arrays when there were still tasks on the active array.
- Fixed preemption of realtime tasks when rt prio inheritance elevated their 
priority.
- Made kernel threads not be reniced to -5 by default
- Changed sched_yield behaviour of SCHED_NORMAL (SCHED_OTHER) to resemble 
realtime task yielding.
