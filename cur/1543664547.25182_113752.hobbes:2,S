I disagree.  A BK clone would almost certainly be highly useful.  The
fact that it would happen to be compatible with one particular
proprietary tool released by one particular company doesn't change
that fact one iota; in fact, some people might find value in using the
proprietary tool for whatever reason (snazzy GUI, keeping the suits
happy, who knows...)
