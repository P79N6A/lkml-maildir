We can do this without having start separte from init as well.

I'd be surprised if Rusty can do it any better than you.  It's hard to
show a race that doesn't exist, even harder to prove that a four-prong
interface is necessary in order to be able to handle it.  The latter is
the question on the table.

Oh indeed, there are weird situations, but they apply equally to the
two-prong and the four-prong interfaces.

This applies equally to the two-prong interface.

This applies equally to the two-prong interface.  Do you see the pattern
yet?
