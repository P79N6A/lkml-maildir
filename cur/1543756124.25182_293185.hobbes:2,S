I was wrong about USB, it doesn't work either. The IDE drive failed
with a non-packet formatted disc, so I didn't bother to check what was
inserted in the USB drive. It turned out it was empty and in that case
the driver doesn't hang.
Anyway, the problem is that the add-struct-request-end_io-callback
patch forgot to update pktcdvd.c. This patch fixes it. It should
probably be merged into the add-struct-request-end_io-callback patch,
because that patch already fixes up other struct request users.
