Well, more importantly, why would we do something like this in the first 
place?
Wouldn't it be a _lot_ better to just use the bog-standard 
"suspend/resume" callbacks, and let serial drivers just suspend/resume on 
their own, instead of having upper layers generate these fake 
"set_termios()" calls?
The serial layer should use set_termios() when users set the termios state 
(surprise surprise), not to emulate suspend/restore. 
Real hardware tends to want to do a lot more _anyway_ for suspend/restore, 
so the argument that "set_termios()" already exists as an interface is 
pretty bogus.
