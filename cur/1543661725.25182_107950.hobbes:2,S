 seems to be 2.4.x-only.
As answered elsewhere, the 2.5 port isn't done yet.  That's why I said in 
my email "if it's ready for 2.5" because I was afraid Matthew hadn't 
gotten around to doing the 2.5 update yet.  However, if no one else can do 
it, I can make a 2.5 update of this driver happen (I don't suspect it 
would be that hard actually, not *that* much has to change).
