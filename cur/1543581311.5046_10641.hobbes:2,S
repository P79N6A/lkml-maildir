hi.
i desperately hope this is not too stupid.
i'm trying to write a driver which depends on giving pci devices
access to somewhat larger amounts of pysical memory. let's say, a
megabyte of contiguous ram.
is it possible to resize such an area later on? i mean: is there some
mechanism available in the kernel to enlarge such a region even if the
area beyond it is already in use?
i understand that this is pretty impossible if some entity depends on
correct physical locations of the pages in question. but couldn't for
example userland memory be copied elsewhere and its new location
simply remapped?
regards,
dns
