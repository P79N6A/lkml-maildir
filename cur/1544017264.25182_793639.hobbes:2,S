Ingo, I'll add my voice to the chorus here.  To reiterate the point, some PMUs count events that are external to the processor cores, and these events cannot be attributed to any one particular CPU -- and certainly not to a particular pid.  The current interface has a restriction that the user cannot pass -1 for both pid and cpu.  But it seems to me that's exactly what would be needed for such off-core events.  Can this feature fit in with the current interface or is some sort of extension needed?
Thanks.
