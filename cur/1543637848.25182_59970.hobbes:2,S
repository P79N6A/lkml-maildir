BTW.> I just noticed quite a "bunch" of single line functions in the
SCIS code. Sort of like:
int scsi_warp_foo(xxx)
{
      foor(whis and that);
}.
EXPORT_SYMBOL(scsi_wrap_foo);
All of them just eat space on the stack during execution.
Would you mind moving them over to scsi.h and making them static inline?
We all know that SCSI has sometimes problems with the limited stack 
depth during kernel code execution time, esp on "Black Big Boxen"...
Well the above "tactics" doesn't hlep buch, but a bit is a bit is a bit 
and "a man/farmer doesn't foregive someone still alive"... :-).
