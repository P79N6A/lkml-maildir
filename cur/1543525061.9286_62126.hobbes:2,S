Very much likely. Virtual memory in 2.2 sucks. We hope to have
it mostly fixed in 2.2.15 (current prepatch level pre-7, get it
from 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/alan/
).
I'd like to hear how that prepatch performs for you. If it
still sucks in certain situations I'll see what I can do...

The critical word here is "appeared". The X server usually maps
in all the video card memory and a half-dozen libraries. All of
those count towards the size of the program, even though not
all of them are memory resident.

The kernel keeps disk buffers around, freeing them when
memory is needed again. Free memory is wasted memory...
(mainly because reading things in from disk is about
100.000 times slower than reading from RAM and we can
free the memory fast enough when we need it again)

It's a known problem and we hope to have solved it in
kernel version 2.2.15.
