Ok, I figured it out.  Kernel 2.3.x handles it correctly.  I was hoping that I
could make this work on 2.2.x by using sigwait()+poll() to fill in the si_band
info when needed.  The F_SETSIG setting doesn't seem to propagate to the worker
thread under 2.2.x -- are there any plans to fix/back port this?
