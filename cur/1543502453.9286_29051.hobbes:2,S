I have recently experienced several oopses, running kernel 2.3.6. Each
time (I was under X) I got the following message coming from
linux/include/linux/wait.h:
bad magic xxxxxx (should be yyyyyy), wq bug, forcing oops.
Here is the output from 'ksymoops'. I don't know if the options used are
appropriate: I'm not familiar with using it.
Options used: -V (specified)
              -O (specified)
              -k /proc/ksyms (specified)
              -l /proc/modules (default)
              -M (specified)
              -c 1 (default)

The kernel was compiled by gcc 2.7.2.3, with devfs and e2compr support
among other things.
Here is some more information:
