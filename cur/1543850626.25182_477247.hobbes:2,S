Which is apparently a known issue, the field has never worked and is useless, 
and what you're supposed to do is a normal stat() on the sucker and and use 
st_dev, which has been horribly abused to perform the function of uniquely 
identifying things like tmpfs instances and /proc. :)
A fix to problem #1 would still be nice, but I can work around most of it...
Thanks,
Rob
