I haven't had any further feedback on the ext2 introduction which I wrote
a few weeks ago.  If I don't get any comments by next week, I'll assume
everyone is happy with it and submit it to Linus.
I shan't attach it as it's about 10k; you can download it from
http://pocket.fluff.org/~mrw/linux/ext2.txt
Thanks.
