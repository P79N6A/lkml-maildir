showkey: (console-tools) 0.2.3 
(maybe modified by debian: console-tools_0.2.3dbs-52)
Actually while working with the Input Event system for my mouse under
Xfree (started by hacking moudev to support eigth button mouse and
remove the 'double' press on my Forward button (one press from the
Logitech Cruise mode, and another from the conversion in mousedev (and
not accurate), and after that creating an Input Event mouse driver for
XFree) i found another weird thing (not investigated for now): All
'extra' keys of the Keyboard (the standard one: play/pause/mail/... and
the new which doesn't work) generate events on the same device than the
mouse (but the normal keys goes to another event device).
