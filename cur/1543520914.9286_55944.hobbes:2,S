If you only need <=2GB, then you can recompile the kernel with the 2GB
option enabled, which should solve the problem.  The 2.2.13 kernel (and
presumably the 2.2.14 kernel, which I haven't tried) support this.
If you need 3GB, you need to switch to a version of the kernel with the
bigmem patch.  I'm running 2.2.13ac3 (which you can find on 
www.kernel.org), which lets me use 3GB of virtual memory in a single
process.
You could also trying using a >=2.3.28 kernel, which also have the bigmem
patch, but I couldn't get those to boot successfully.
See 
http://humbolt.geo.uu.nl/Linux-MM/
 for info about linux memory
management, though it hasn't been updated in a while.
One note:  If you use mmap to get memory instead of malloc you get less
memory.  On 2.2.13ac I get 2GB maximum per process for mmap and 3GB
maximum per process for malloc.
