Absolutely.  This is the route I'm taking, and I just use an ioctl to flip the 
task bit as I mentioned (much) earlier.  It still needs to be beaten up in 
practice.  The cluster snapshot block device, which has a relatively complex 
userspace server, should be a nice test case.

I was talking about in-kernel.  Once we let the PF_MEMALLOC state escape to 
user space, things start looking brighter.  But you still have to invoke that 
userspace code somehow, and there is no direct way to do it, hence 
PF_MEMALLOC isn't inherited.  An easy solution is to have a userspace daemon 
that's always in PF_MEMALLOC state, as Andrew mentioned, which we can control 
via a pipe or similar.

Yes, that's what the ioctl is about.  However, this doesn't work for servicing 
writeout.
