} 2.4.0-test10 doesn't compile correctly on a mac.
} Only 2 changes are necessary to make it work.
} Or are there any bigger problems with the ppc arch?
} 
} the 2 changes:
} in ./include/asm-ppc/param.h the following lines have to be added
} right before the last #endif:
} 
} #ifdef __KERNEL__
} # define CLOCKS_PER_SEC 100 /* frequency at which times() counts */
} #endif
} 
} in ./drivers/input/keybdev.c the second #elif (CONFIG_ADB) or
} something like that should be changed to #else or the correct #elif
} statement.
} 
} I don't know who's the maintainer of the ppc arch - i think ibm has
} taken it over or am i wrong about that?
No, that's not right :)
Grab the latest ppc tree from www.fsmlabs.com/linuxppcbk.html.  The fixes
are there and the main kernel.org tree will be brought up to speed.
