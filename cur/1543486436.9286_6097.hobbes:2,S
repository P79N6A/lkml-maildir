That's exactely one of the reasons i created the linux-perf list: To pool
the available information and provide the Linux community with a set of
tools _and_ instructions for the preformance tuning of their favourite
OS.
Alas a lot of people have already subscribed but nobody is stepping forward
to offer any opinion...  Don't be so shy folks!
