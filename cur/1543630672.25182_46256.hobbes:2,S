I've thought it over a few times over the last few weeks, and tbh
inclusion in any tree other than Linus' doesn't really make much sense
other than perhaps to get some more 'early adopter' testers.
The current kbuild2.5 patches will apply cleanly against my tree, but
due to things like the new input layer still not being completely merged
in Linus' tree, some files are in different places, so the Makefile.in's
in kbuild2.5 point to the wrong places.
Sure, I could merge it, but tbh it's not worth the effort right now
of fixing up those files until Linus actually says yay or nay.
    Dave.
