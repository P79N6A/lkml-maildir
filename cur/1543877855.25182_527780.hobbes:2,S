In case somebody wants to play around with Rik patch or another
madvise-based patch, I have x86-64 glibc binaries which can use it:

These are based on the latest Fedora rawhide version.  They should work
on older systems, too, but you screw up your updates.  Use them only if
you know what you do.
By default madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) is used.  With the environment variable
  MALLOC_MADVISE
one can select a different hint.  The value of the envvar must be the
number of that other hint.
