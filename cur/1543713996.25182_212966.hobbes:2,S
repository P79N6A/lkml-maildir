That wasn't there when I wrote the code. I will do that change, thanks.

Locking. policies get locked by their VM.
(the sharing you're advocating would require adding a new lock to 
mempolicy)

It already has 6 arguments - 7 are not allowed. Also playing with a different
process' VM remotely is just a recipe for disaster IMHO (remember
all the security holes that used to be in /proc/pid/mem)

I think it's cleaner to have them separated.

No, the original test is correct.

Yes, it could be removed.
