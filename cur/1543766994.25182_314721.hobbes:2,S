Please have some patience.  This is not a commercial support forum,
so there's no guarantees on getting any answers what so ever.
However, please use search engines like google - they can answer these
types of questions far faster than anyone here can.  For example, type
"linux kernel bugzilla" into google and see what you discover.
You can also use the source code repositories at 
http://linux.bkbits.net/
and 
http://ehlo.org/~kay/gitweb.pl
 to find out what's in mainline kernel
trees.
And no, no one's here.  No one knows what's in any kernel.  Nobody
knows how to figure out any problems. 8)
