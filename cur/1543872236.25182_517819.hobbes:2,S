OK, between this and the additional LIM hooks I didn't notice in an earlier
patch, we're starting to see the API.   The only problem is that although
it may be the right API for *your* code, I suspect it's a non-starter without
a discussion about whether it's the right *generic* API for an LIM (which will
require at least one dramatic bun fight about what "Integrity" means).

The 'default' should in general match the hint we give the user.
