It *IS* a bug, but only Mark Lord, (the hdparm maintainer), and I seem to care about it - everybody else says, "just do hdparm -y instead", which is missing the point.
Incidently, I think you mean:
On RH7.3 (2.4.18-3) if I do:
$ hdparm -y /dev/hda
$ do stuff and disk spins up
$ hdparm -Y /dev/hda
$ everything hangs waiting for disk
with a lower case y for the first example.
So, unless you, I, or Mark Lord fixes it, it stays broken :-).
John.
