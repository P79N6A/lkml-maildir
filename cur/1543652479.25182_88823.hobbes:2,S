FWIW, we seem to have a not-unsimilar problem.
Board is a Gigabyte GA-7VRXP which has an on-board Promise 20276.
For me:
Processes get stuck in D after a couple of days, and kernel log shows
an invalid NULL deference in find_inode() in fs/inode.c, when it does
inode->i_ino
dereference.
It does not check for whether inode is NULL or not.
I realize that appears to be valid, because it appears to me that inode
should never be NULL when it is retrieved from list_entry().
I have the ksymoops oops file available, I would be more than happy to
post that up if anyone wants to take a look.
