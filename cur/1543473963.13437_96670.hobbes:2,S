How about something like the following:
 Q> mke2fs /dev/hdc2
 Q> mount -t ext2 /dev/hdc2 /tmp
 Q> fsck -V -a | tee /tmp/fsck.log.`date +%Y-%m-%d.%T`
It would require the following line in /etc/fstab to work:
 Q> /dev/hdc2 /tmp ext2 defaults 0 0
Note the last two values: since this partition is recreated every
boot, it never needs checking anyway...

True...
Best wishes from Riley.
