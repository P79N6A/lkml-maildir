Well, if the application has generated the single document as many files,

Sure, but stored as a single stream, using a virtual filesystem or stream
multiplexing library.

Isn't this also something that could best be done in the gui framework ala
OLE? I think gnome is working on this now (i think it's called gnorba?)
and KDE has had their equivilant for a while too.
In this case, gimp *might* be able to invoked in this way, assuming it has
been compiled with support for such things. (Implemented in a userspace 
library.)
Sure it might be nice to dig through it, but breaking everything else is
considerably less nice.
You want kernel support? How's this scenario:
 - a VFS or streams based implementation is created as a C library
 - gnome/kde/whatever uses this to create compound documents
 - install userfs
 - create a userfs 'module' (it's not a kernel module) against the C
   library to let you browse it like a normal file
Or like I said before, midnight commander already lets you do this for tar
files, you could likely easily support this 'compound document' format.

Sure, I'm all for efficiency and convenience. But not at the cost of
breaking things.
Has anyone even for a moment considered the impact that kernel support
would have on things like POSIX compliance et al?

So you agree that compound documents and kernel changes should be kept
seperate?

I noticed RH6 does. Bad example.... 'cp * /newdir' is more illustrative of
this.

So you can use whatever extraction tools come with the libraries I
proposed to do just that.
Also, how useful is it really to be able to do this? Isn't the image in
the word processor document a part of THAT document, and not really a
seperate entity for that purpose? To rephrase, wouldn't you really want to
edit the document component in the context of the WHOLE document? Makes
more sense to me.

No. But I'm not the one (and I'm not sure anyone was) proposing we go
stuffing the HTML and graphics making up the whole page into a single
filesystem entity. Heck, while we're at it, let's put our CGI's in there
too. Maybe we can put the whole dang site in a single file with 3000
resource forks? Can you see how this scenario borders on the rediculous?

Why bother with the single file representation at all then? It doesn't
bother most to tar up a website to transport it.

But they're not dealing with single documents. One directory of web isn't
necessarily one document, it could be many, or even a whole site, And
representing it as anything but a directory of files is futile.

Well my response to this is simple. If you want that kind of integration,
you're going to need a fair bit more than the ability to group files to
make it happen. Implementing what amounts to 'tar in the kernel' isn't
going to help with the formatting and embedding issues.

Which is a goal a C library can faithfully accomplish, and a kernel hack
cannot.

Nothing is stopping them from doing that either.
