This is exactly the approach of mkdump version <=1.0
	
http://mkdump.sourceforge.net/
As documented by Itsuro Oda:
	
http://mkdump.cvs.sourceforge.net/mkdump/doc/mini_kernel_tech_note.txt?revision=1.1
There is a problem all the drivers expect that allocated buffer address can be
passed directly as physical address to the hardware.  mkdump-1.0 has a lot of
backward-mappings for these drivers but you can never catch all of them.
