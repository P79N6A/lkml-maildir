Subject: [PATCH] LIRC drivers for 2.6.0-test2 (and earliers) - 3rd version
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

You can download it from here
http://flameeyes.web.ctonet.it/patch-2.6.0-test2-lirc.diff.bz2.
Sorry for not inlining it but it seens too big to be sent to lkml.
This version fixes problems using lirc_dev as a module (it needs to be
compiled in the kernel), merges the patch that Koos Vriezen sent to me
for homebrew receivers, the lirc's cvs fixes for lirc_serial, and add
the new atiusb driver (from lirc's cvs).
I'm trying to rejoin the i2c driver but it need more work.
I hope this patch will work for everyone.
