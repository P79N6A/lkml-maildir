The first question is not "Bugzilla" but "Does bug tracking make sense?".
Many bug reports to linux-kernel get zero attention and are lost without 
tracking. Is losing bug reports OK or do we need a tracking of bugs?
Tracking means:
- not to miss bug reports
- record discussions and the status of the bugs
- the real value comes from:
  provide useful reports like "all open ACPI bugs" or "all 2.6.21-rc 
  regressions" to people who are actually working on fixing the bugs
I was tracking 2.6.21-rc regressions.
Some people said this was useful.
Manually tracking of three dozen regressions plus sending regular sorted 
reports was at the limit of what I am able to handle manually without 
any tracking tool.
There are two different questions that seem to often be mixed in 
discussions:
The first question is:
Does it make sense to track kernel bugs?
If no, there's no need to discuss Bugzilla or other tools.
If yes, the second question is:
Which tracking tool would make sense for the Linux kernel?
This could be Bugzilla, the Debian bug tracking system, or even 
something written from scratch.
