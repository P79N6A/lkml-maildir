Yes, but then you couldn't validate it like Linus asked for.
Also we've had cases where this information was corrupted
(e.g. when RSP starts somewhere completely bogus)

Also how would you know in what kind of stack you are to select the right
check mask (since exception  stacks are larger than 8K)?  You would also need make 
unvalidated assumptions again.
The unwinder already does stronger validation than any of this.
That particularly case here was a hole in the fallback logic that got
actually fixed before 2.6.18 (not it was a -rc3 or so)
