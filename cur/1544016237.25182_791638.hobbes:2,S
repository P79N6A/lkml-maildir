Yes I understand, but if splice() is running, wakeup occured, and
no need to check if the wakeup was good or not... just proceed and
consume some skb, since we already were awaken.
Then, an application might setup a high SO_RCVLOWAT, but want to splice()
only few bytes, so RCVLOWAT is only a hint for the thing that perform the
wakeup, not for the consumer.
