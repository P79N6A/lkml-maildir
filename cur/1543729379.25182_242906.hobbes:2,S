You might want to intentionally plug or unplug them.  Live music != a
server room.  Think laptop DJs.  It would be bad if plugging into the
network caused a click in your sound output - this could be VERY loud
depnding on the setting!
This will become more important once Linux has good
audio/midi-over-ethernet support.  You might be playing sound out of
your sound interface, and sending the same sound over the network as UDP
packets for recording or additional processing.
