Subject: Bug in open() function (?)

	I was playing around today and found that if an existing file is opened with 
O_TRUNC | O_RDONLY, the existing file is truncated.  This is contrary to the 
documentation for "man 2 open".  Which behavior is correct, the man page, or 
what actually happens?  Or wold this be considered a glibc/libc problem?  
This is on a stock 2.5.74 kernel.
	'man 2 open', on O_TRUNC: If  the  file already exists and is a regular file 
and the open mode allows writing (i.e., is O_RDWR or O_WRONLY) it will be 
truncated to length 0.
