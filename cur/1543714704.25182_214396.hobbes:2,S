debian unstable
kernel 2.6.5 with udev
promise sata150 tx4
dual seagate ST3120026AS (120GB)
libata 1.02
sata_promise 0.91
Thank you all!
I use lvm2 with /dev/sda and /dev/sdb as members of my volume group. 
That means, no partition tables.  The logical volume contains a 
ReiserFS.  Once the logical volume is mounted the higher transfer rates 
are seen.
22 root@chaljin:/mnt # mount /dev/sdb1 sdb1
23 root@chaljin:/mnt # mount | grep sdb
/dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/part1 on /mnt/sdb1 type ext2 (rw)
24 root@chaljin:/mnt # hdparm -t /dev/sdb
/dev/sdb:
  Timing buffered disk reads:   32 MB in  3.04 seconds =  10.52 MB/sec
25 root@chaljin:/mnt # hdparm -t /dev/sdb
/dev/sdb:
  Timing buffered disk reads:  166 MB in  3.02 seconds =  54.98 MB/sec
26 root@chaljin:/mnt # umount /dev/sdb1
Ah, the change is not stable either.  If I umount the partition it
reverts to the slower rate.  There is no need to reboot.

Yes, dd does behave the same as hdparm.

If anyone wants further testing just let me know.  I still have one 
blank disk and one promise sata150 tx4 controller that is not yet in use.
