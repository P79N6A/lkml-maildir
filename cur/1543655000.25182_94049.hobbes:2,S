Try the GNU-and-improved:
	make -j4
I just tried that and it works fine.
I think MAKE= is a remnant of the old kbuild.  Shouldn't be needed
anymore since the build doesn't descend into directories the way it used
to.
Also, just plain "make" is preferred now, too :)
It builds bzImage and modules both.
