Nesting simply means that any child ns can create child namespaces of
it's own.
In particular, the following scenario should be perfectly valid:
	Machine 1                    Machine 2
	  Xen VM1.1                    Xen VM2.1
	    vserv 1.1.1                  vserv2.1.1
	      cont1.1.1.1                  cont2.1.1.1
	      cont1.1.1.2                  cont2.1.1.2
	      cont1.1.1.n                  cont2.1.1.n
	    vserv 1.1.2                  vserv2.1.2
	      cont1.1.2.1                  cont2.1.2.1
	      cont1.1.2.2                  cont2.1.2.2
	      cont1.1.2.n                  cont2.1.2.n
	  Xen VM1.2                    Xen VM2.2
	    vserv 1.2.1                  vserv2.2.1
	      cont1.2.1.1                  cont2.2.1.1
	      cont1.2.1.2                  cont2.2.1.2
	      cont1.2.1.n                  cont2.2.1.n
	    vserv 1.2.2                  vserv2.2.2
	      cont1.2.2.1                  cont2.2.2.1

where containers are used for each virtual server and each container,
so that we can migrate entire VMs, entire virtual servers, or any
container.
