as a sidenote -- shutdown -r -t 4 now is executed and if I get rid of the -t
4, the number of times it fails to shutdown is decreased.
the system emits :
b/cast msg from root.. system going down for reboot
INIT: switching to runlevel 6
INIT: sending programs the TERM signal
[and there it hangs]
note that with the same hardware, not SMP but UP kernels -- it happily
reboots without problems.
it seems an SMP vs UP issue and might be timing related or so.
