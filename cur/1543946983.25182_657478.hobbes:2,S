Subject: POWERPC : What's "SPE used in kernel" ?

Dear list,
I have just compiled linux-2.6.24 for a MPC8540 target using a MPC8540
specific gcc.
I then got thousands of "SPE used in kernel" messages.  Looking at the
sources I ifdeffed out the printk call in KernelSPE, and I now have a
silent kernel, that seems to work fine.
Is there something wrong in my setting and should I look further to
debug this problem or is this perfectly normal ?
I wonder why a kernel configured for E500 using a E500-specific gcc
triggers this message.  Is it invalid to use SPE instructions in the kernel ?
