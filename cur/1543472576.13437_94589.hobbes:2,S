I get the same message at the college (Digital UNIX OSF1) ... For me it
usually results in a Netscape core dump....
The bit about having to reset the machine in Linux is the part that
worries me. I remember having too do the same thing when gnuplot locked my
machine solid, for two days!! (I was living in the hope that it will
'recover'). The error then was out memory exhausted (128M + 32M swap) ...
well I was tasking it however, the fact that all other terminals were
inaccessible did bother me a bit ..
