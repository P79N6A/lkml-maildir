Subject: CONFIG_SWAP=n broken in latest tree

Commit 42da9cbd ("mm: mincore anon") breaks CONFIG_SWAP=n builds with:
    mm/built-in.o: In function `sys_mincore':
    (.text+0xe2c4): undefined reference to `swapper_space'
because swapper_space is used unconditionally in mm/mincore.c but only
defined in swap_state.c, which isn't built if CONFIG_SWAP=n.
I'd include a patch but I'm not sure what the right fix is really --
the naively obvious thing to do would be to add an #ifdef to mincore.c
like the below, but I don't know this area at all well enough to be
confident in the fix.
