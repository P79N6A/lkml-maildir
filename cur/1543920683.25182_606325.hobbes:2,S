Gag-me.  That *is* bad.  But the PCIe folks seem to be extra sensitive
about the code, so I'm trying to change as little as possible here.
That line was just the result of doing this in vim:    :%s/[ 	]*$//g  
I agree there's a lot of funny looking code in there,
but that's not what this particular patch series is about.
You could submit a follow-up patch to repair that stuff, if you like.
Mmm.. I wonder how clever gcc is with a line like that.. ?  ;)
Cheers!
