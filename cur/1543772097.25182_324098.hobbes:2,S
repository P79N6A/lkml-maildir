All the logs are linked off here:

Just click on the ABORT messages in hte left column. But I'm thinking maybe
I'm off by one, and it might be:
x86_64-port-over-e820-gap-detection-from-i386.patch
I'm double checking right now. Even once it's we get back to a point where
it boots, it seems to consistently hang every time in the same place, which
seems to be caused, AFAICS by
x86_64-use-a-common-function-to-find-code-segment-bases-fix.patch
I'll double check that too before anyone shoots it ... gimme a few hours.
