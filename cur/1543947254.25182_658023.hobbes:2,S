Sorry, I meant to ping you on this directly.  I'm not sure how to effect these
two functions for Smack.

Note that you won't be able to use CacheFiles with Smack if either of these
just returns an error.  This may also affect NFSd in the future too.
smack_task_create_files_as() is passed the label that new files created by
CacheFiles should be created with.
For smack_task_kernel_act_as(), it may be sufficient to set CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE in
the task_security struct and leave it as that.  It also may not be sufficient,
as NFSd may end up using this to set the subjective security label supplied by
the NFS client.  I don't know, though, whether Smack is going to be involved in
that passing labels over NFS.
