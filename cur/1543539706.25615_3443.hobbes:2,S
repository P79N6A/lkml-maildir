Or validate the commands listed in the SPEC for the default enable
interface, and grant unrestriced access to all command with a compile
option plus a sysctl flag that defaults in the off.
You will then no longer violate the usage of the SPEC by default.
You will preserve the drive warrenties, and protect the commerial
distribution market place for being liable for intent.
Specifically, it is public record that a distribution shipping without a
taskfile filter in ATA and SCSI (I have this now) to carry copablity of
knowingly with intent to sell product that allows no protection for
improper calls to the hardware.
All you have to do is provide a default approved filter, and include the
non-default option to disable the filter to not violate unix policies of
no-policies and cover linux and distrubtors from issues that can be deemed
actionable.
Upon the user disabling the command-filter, everyone is cleared of any and
all issues that can be deemed actionable, and make the individual
responsible for their actions and not you or the maintainers copablity.
This is all I want.........not to be sued in the future for decisions that
are not mine to be made.
