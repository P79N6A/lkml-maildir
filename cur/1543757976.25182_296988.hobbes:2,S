Well, not quite, although it is an improvement.
As long as the capabilities module does not support stacking, anybody 
needing capabilities and e.g. on-access scanning with Dazuko will 
have to unload this module, load another module, and reload it. This 
creates a nasty race condition. BTW, what happens if capabilities 
have been compiled static, not as a module?
AFAIK, not all LSM modules provide correct stacking. At least all 
modules in the main line kernel should really support the official 
way. But this is just a few cents from someone not using LSM...
