A moment ago I put man-pages-1.35 the usual places
(e.g. on 
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/manpages
).
David Mosberger expressed his worry
that especially man page Section 2 is out-dated
and x86 specific, with no indication that other
architectures even exist. No doubt he is right.
So, request to all: (i) point out which man pages are
outdated or missing, and if possible (ii) supply patches
or entirely new pages.
Send contributions to aeb@cwi.nl, not (only) to some
mailing list or bug list.
