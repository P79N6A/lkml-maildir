To facilitate this do NOT introduce CONFIG_SLAB until we decide
that SLUB are default. In this way we can make CONFIG_SLUB be default
and people will not continue with CONFIG_SLAB because they had it in their
.config already.
Or just rename CONFIG_SLAB to CONFIG_SLAB_DEPRECATED or something.
The point is make sure that LSUB becomes default for people that does
an make oldconfig (explicit or implicit).
