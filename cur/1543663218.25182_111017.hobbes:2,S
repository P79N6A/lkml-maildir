One more test of 2.5.62-mm1 on a big memory system w/qlogic FC
controller. 
JennyZ has run OSDL's dbt3 workload on an 8-CPU system CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y
(she's out today, so i'm Mr.Hands) 
Dbt3 is a decision support workload.
"DBT3 power
load has some disk write and the beginning and end of
the run, most disk activity is read. I did not see any
problem during the run.
The file calc_power.out records the mesurement.  The
higher the power, the better the performance. "
