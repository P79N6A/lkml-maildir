That was the way it was as of 2.6.10-mm1 and it stayed that way through
2.6.12.  When did that decision change?  If it was there in the
archives, I missed it in the search.
If this was a Greg-only decision, perhaps a patch reversing the change
addressed to Linus would get a solid yes/no decision from the top.
From what I gather in the archives, the last time this happened it was
just a leak from Greg's tree and not an official policy change.  It
isn't in the feature removal schedule, even though other _GPL changes
are listed there.
