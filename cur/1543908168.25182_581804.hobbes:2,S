But those accesses might be done non-atomically then (for example,
if the compiler knows it only needs to write one byte, it might not
bother writing the rest), so that's no good if you want to read the
thing atomically too.

Hrm, you mean within a lock or similar?  You'll get the same semantics
as volatile anyway there.
