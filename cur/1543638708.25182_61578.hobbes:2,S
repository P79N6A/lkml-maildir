- Does this problem still exist in 2.4.19?
- Are there temperature problems inside your machine?
- Does your power supply give your system enough energy?
- You can test your memory using memtest86 [1].
- Is there anything in the logfiles after the machine "mysteriously
  rebooted"?
- If none of the above helps, could you type the information of the
  screenshot (best the information if it happens using 2.4.19) to a file
  and run it through ksymoops?
