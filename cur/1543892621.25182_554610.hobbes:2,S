Right it may be hung_up_tty_read that was what bothered me. I've had a
think through the different scenarios and I can't think of a simple one
where I can abuse this as the vhangup() path is current root triggered
and loses the tty (so I can't reopen on it)
There are more complex questions - what happens when the much needed
revoke() goes mainstream [and we fix all the security issues its lack
causes], and the case where I do
	login on tty1
	login on tty2
On tty1 run a process which sets nohup and causes a vhangup then opens
tty2 while tty2 command line is running some long running program that
doesn't take input that I could plausibly run legitimately (eg a long
complex sql query, or a slow security check etc)
