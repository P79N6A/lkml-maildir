In that case nothing, except that when we drop the lock and check it is
the earliest place where preemption is allowed.  In the normal scenario,
however, we have a check for reschedule on return from interrupt (e.g.
the timer) and thus preempt in the same manner as with user space and
that is the key.

That is certainly one option, and Andrew's patch is very good. 
Nonetheless, I think we need a more general framework that tackles the
problem itself.  Preemptible kernel does this, yields results now, and
allows for greater return later on.
