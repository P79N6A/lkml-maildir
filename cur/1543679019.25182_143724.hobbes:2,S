Oh, BTW ... I suspect you've realised this already, but ....
The buddy allocator is not a good system for getting rid of fragmentation. 
If I group pages together in aligned pairs, and F is free and A is 
allocated, it'll not do anything useful with this:
F A   A F   F A   A F   F A   A F   F A   A F   F A   F A 
because the adjacent "F"s aren't "buddies". It seems that the purpose of
the buddy allocator was to be quick at allocating pages. Now that we stuck
a front end cache on it, in the form of hot & cold pages, that goal no
longer seems paramount - altering it to reduce fragmentation at the source,
rather than actively defrag afterwards would seem like a good goal to me.
