 Because they are lazy/incapable/out-of-time/select-your-favourite-excuse.  
For the chip to work you have to provide some minimal support in the 
firmware, in particular for the trickier paths of execution in the system 
management mode.  The system still works with the Local APIC disabled, so 
why bother?

 The LINT0 and LINT1 inputs of the APIC are routed straight to the INT and 
NMI inputs of the CPU respectively and the rest of the APIC logic becomes 
inactive (tri-stated, etc.).
