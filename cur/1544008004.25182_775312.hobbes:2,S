Ah, I failed to notice this required some new byteorder code!  Sorry.

Interesting.  Sparse must have grown up then.  It used to complain  
(although I always thought it was complaining incorrectly given that  
binary bit operations are endianness agnostic).

Yes, you have convinced me.  (-:
Andrew, please feel free to apply the patch.
