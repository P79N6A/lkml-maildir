This is either-or. No "a bit overcommitted is OK", it _could_ lead to
processes dying at random, which you aren't tolerating.

The infrastructure you are talking about just doesn't exist _at all_ (if it
was extant, this discussion wouldn't be taking place at all), so your 0.5%
is at best a crude guess. If you are counting the cost of Rik's patch,
expanding this to a full-blown user quota system means:
- Set up a data structure for keeping track of user's allowances, using up
  RAM
- Adjust it each time said user does something. Note that most of the ideas
  for accounting shared resources that have been discussed here (divide the
  size of code segments among users, for instance) does need extra
  processing _for each current user_, and possibly extra infrastructure
  that just isn't there now
This doesn't sound like 0.5% of what the kernel does right now to me...
