Hello,
> Add "root=nfs" to your kernel command line.
I checked with Pete and as I suspected, putting kernel parameters on the
command line doesn't work as proll just drops them.
So, I made a bit of a hack:
[ian@slinky:~/tmp/js/linux/arch/sparc/kernel]$ diff -u setup.c.orig
setup.c
--- setup.c.orig        Sat Nov 17 00:30:25 2001
+++ setup.c     Tue Dec 18 19:44:16 2001
@@ -306,6 +306,10 @@
 
        /* Initialize PROM console and command line. */
        *cmdline_p = prom_getbootargs();
+
+       /* Hack to hard code root=nfs. */
+       strcat(*cmdline_p,"root=nfs");
+
        strcpy(saved_command_line, *cmdline_p);
 
        /* Set sparc_cpu_model */
Now when it boots, it says "Kernel command line: root=nfs" but still,
the kernel does not try and do the IP-Config/bootp stuff so it fails
saying it can't find the NFS server which is obvious as it doesn't have
an ip etc...
Any other ideas?
Thanks!
Ian
