I thought I cleaned that message out in v2.0.
The BIOS failed to supply _PSS objects that Linux could
recognize.  The powernow-k8 driver tried to use a PSB 
table, but MP/dual-core systems can't use PSB tables.  
The driver errored out.
If you can get it to work with 2.6.18 and it doesn't work
with 2.6.19-rc1, the most likely culprit is a change in the
ACPI subsystem.
Can you get decompiled dumps of the DSDT?  See the ACPI
pages on sourceforge if you need instructions.
