Subject: [PATCH] vfs: fix permission checking in sys_utimensat
If utimensat() is called with both times set to UTIME_NOW or one of them to
UTIME_NOW and the other to UTIME_OMIT, then it will update the file time
without any permission checking.
I don't think this can be used for anything other than a local DoS, but
could
be quite bewildering at that (e.g.  "Why was that large source tree rebuilt
when I didn't modify anything???")
This affects all kernels from 2.6.22, when the utimensat() syscall was
introduced.
Fix by doing the same permission checking as for the "times == NULL" case.
Thanks to Michael Kerrisk, whose utimensat-non-conformances-and-fixes.patch
in
-mm also fixes this (and breaks other stuff), only he didn't realize the
security implications of this bug.
