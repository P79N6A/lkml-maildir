The answer just came to me, because you may have deleted creation of a 
module, and make doesn't know how to get it out of the directory. So the 
modules file is rebuilt from zero, rather than put in a lot of logic 
which might result in problems.
Think moving a driver from module to built in, what happens if you 
modprobe the module? Or if you delete a module totally because some 
other module does your hardware better. Think network and sound on that, 
particularly. You do NOT want the old "works-badly" module around ready 
to jump in when something you overlooked loads it.
Just a case of preventing problems all at once rather than trying to be 
clever. I would think building a kernel on that hardware would take 
longer than the useful life of the release. I used to build 1.2.13 on a 
slow machine, and that took days.
In any case you have an answer, it's because being clever is hard.
