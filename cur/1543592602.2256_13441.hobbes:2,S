Are you sure it is idle. It might be running something from cron-
say 'updatedb' or similar. That will cause a lot of disk i/o,
and _ofcourse_ performance will be bad then - the machine is
doing a lot of other things.
It might also be that you don't have enough memory and the
machine is swapping itself to death. Running netscape or
mozilla perhaps? These are known to blow themselves up to
50-100 MB (!). That will cause the exact symptoms you're seeing.

2.2.12 is old. In my experience, 2.2.19 is the first really
good 2.2 kernel. Especially in low-memory situations like
you might be experiencing..

2.4.2 isn't all that good either.. 2.4.x doesn't have VM sorted
out just yet

Sounds about right for a non-UDMA disk.

Try 2.2.19
