*Yuck*
ALSA code, as pretty as ever.  No, that's not a fix; it's only shutting the
rightfully complaining compiler up.
What happens there is a dirty kludge created for the benefit of a single
driver (sound/pci/cs4281.c).  Said driver has a bunch of registers
memory-mapped, while its relatives use port IO instead.  Driver does
(correctly) ioremap(); then it overloads the arguments of snd_opl3_create()
normally used for port numbers and shoves *address obtained from ioremap
and divided by 4* in them.
Sigh...  At the very least that kind of abuse should stop.  FWIW, I would
suggest having cs4281.c set the ->command() directly and killing that crap
with ->l_port/->r_port overloading.
