Agreed. I said I wasn't going to argue about it because there *ARE* 
distinctions that the law makes and the GPL ignores. You can't have it both 
ways. If the module is distributed *with* the kernel *SOURCE* then it doesn't 
matter if it's a derivative work or not, because it becomes covered by the 
kernels license. If it's distributed with the kernel *binaries* then it is 
covered by its own license. In that case the only reason you'd have a right 
to the source is if the module is considered a "derivative work".
