Not a comment on your patch at all, just an FYI in case you've missed
it, and in case it makes any difference to your ia64 needs.
A side-effect of 2.6.15-rc's PageReserved changes is that a user with
access to /dev/mem can now mmap any page of it, and see what's there
rather than zeroes, whether or not it has been marked PageReserved.
