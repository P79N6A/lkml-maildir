Well in the paravirt case since we are starting virtually mapped
if we don't start with vmlinux but bzImage we need to define what
that virtual address space should contain, and where in the address
space it is safe to put those page tables.
Of the requirements I have heard so far that is the trickiest one.
Because it basically requires us to have a reasonable worst case
estimate of how much memory we are going to use before we start using
the bootmem allocator.
