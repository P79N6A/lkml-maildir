Devfs isn't supposed to manage your block queues. That's not what it's
designed for. Devfs is just a way of managing your device nodes.
Block queue management can be done by the "generic" block I/O layer
(or you can write your own management code, but that's not
practical). This layer requires that you have a major number for your
driver, so that certain information can be shoved into some static
arrays (yes, it's butt-ugly, and it will change in 2.5).
You can use the devfs_alloc_major() function to grab a major number
that won't conflict with another driver. Then use that major when
calling devfs_register().
