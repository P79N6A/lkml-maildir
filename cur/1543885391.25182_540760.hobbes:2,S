I've tested this and can confirm it works.  dvb_class will be set too late
without the change to subsys_initcall.

Probably better to make this a separate patch, since it's not related.

"couldn't find free device id"
If it's ok with you, I'll import your patch as two seperate patches with
the spelling errors fixed?

The dvb-core dvbdev_debug parameter does nothing but turn on this one
single dprintk.  I'm tempted to just delete it.
