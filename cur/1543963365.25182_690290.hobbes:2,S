Ahh, so it's probably still the BKL that is the problem, it's just not in 
the file locking code. The changes to fs/locks.c probably didn't matter 
all that much, and the additional regression was likely just some 
perturbation.
So it's probably fasync that AIM7 tests. Quite possibly coupled with 
/dev/tty etc. No file locking.
