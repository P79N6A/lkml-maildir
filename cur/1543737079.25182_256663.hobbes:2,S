bz2 has resulted in corrupted unpacks here on more than one occasion, 
and it has done it without any outwardly visible error when the 
md5sum was good.  I've had it skip a whole subdir tree in a kernel 
unpack on at least 4 occasions, and a missing file someplace on 
several more occasions.  I don't have any such troubles when dl'ing 
and using the .gz version of things.
There has been at least one occasion where the .bz2 dl had a bad 
md5sum, again without any visible error as it was downloading, nuke 
it and go back and get the same file again and it was good.  Again 
I've had no such troubles when using the .gz versions, so after a a 
while, I got into the habit of just gettng the .gz version and I've 
never had an instance of a bad md5sum that wasn't accompanied by site 
access problems.

There was a discussion about that here on the lkml, and linus's 
decision was to reference all further patches against 2.6.8.  Its 
broken, but its the anchor point till 2.6.9 comes out.

Other than amdump made a half fubar'd backup last night using -rc3, 
its running reasonably well here.  If the amdump bombs again tonight, 
then we get out the magnifying glass & start looking.  But first I'd 
have to know where to start & there are no odd entries in the log for 
that time of the morning.
