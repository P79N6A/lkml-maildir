arch/i386/pci/dma.c now only contains pci_alloc_consistent() and
pci_free_consistent().  What kind of configuration are you using that
works without CONFIG_PCI and yet calls those functions?  Is it a ISA_PNP
type configuration?  Do you have a .config that this fails on?

I'd be glad to move it back, but I'd like to understand who is using
those functions outside of the pci and isa_pnp drivers.
