OK, I'll try to reestablish it.
Look: I can't fix *everyone's* stuff.  This was a consequence of ongoing
unbounded churn in the x86 tree.  If we can find a way of preventing those
guys (and everyone else) from trashing everyone else's stuff then we'd have
much smoother sailing.
Feel free to fix up Martin's patches against mmotm and we're good.  Should
take you less than an hour.
