That's a very interesting discovery that you made here. I have made
mesurements with this line commented out just to get an idea. The
hardest part was to find a CPU-bound machine. Finally I slowed my
laptop down to 300 MHz (in fact, 600 with throttle 50%, but let's
call that 300). That way, I cannot saturate the PCI-based tg3 and
I can observe the effects of various changes on the data rate.
- original tcp_splice_read(), with "!timeo"    : 24.1 MB/s
- modified tcp_splice_read(), without "!timeo" : 32.5 MB/s (+34%)
- original with line #1246 commented out       : 34.5 MB/s (+43%)
So you're right, avoiding calling tcp_read_sock() all the time
gives a nice performance boost.
Also, I found that tcp_splice_read() behaves like this when breaking
out of the loop :
    lock_sock();
    while () {
         ...
         __tcp_splice_read();
         ...
         release_sock();
         lock_sock();
         if (break condition)
              break;
    }
    release_sock();
Which means that when breaking out of the loop on (!timeo)
with ret > 0, we do release_sock/lock_sock/release_sock.
So I tried a minor modification, consisting in moving the
test before release_sock(), and leaving !timeo there with
line #1246 commented out. That's a noticeable winner, as
the data rate went up to 35.7 MB/s (+48%).
Also, in your second mail, you're saying that your change
might return more data than requested by the user. I can't
find why, could you please explain to me, as I'm still quite
ignorant in this area ?
Thanks,
Willy
