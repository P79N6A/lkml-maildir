The es1371 has had unresolved symbols for me in every kernel after 2.3.42
that I could get to compile.
I saw several post of problems with this module lately, but no one seemed to
get any error messages when trying to install the module.  It seemed to be
compile errors or crashes after installing.  I can get the module to install
at all.  Here is the output:
# insmod es1371
Using /lib/modules/2.3.46/misc/es1371.o
/lib/modules/2.3.46-pre2/misc/es1371.o: unresolved symbol
