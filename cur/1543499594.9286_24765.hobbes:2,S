I know a while back there was talk of a method of upgrading your kernel for
things like security holes, new features, etc using a binary method similar to
the way we use insmod to load kernel modules.
Does anyone know what happened to all the plans that were made? It sure would be
nice not to have to reboot to upgrade my kernels.
