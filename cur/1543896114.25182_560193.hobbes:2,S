Today PF_MEMALLOC doesn't do much in interrupt context. If PF_MEMALLOC
is the right usage model for this, then we need to fix the behavior of
PF_MEMALLOC in the interrupt context(for our usage model, we do most
of the allocations in interrupt context).
I am not very familiar with PF_MEMALLOC. So experts please comment.
