You're right.  There is no data lock-in, so there is no reason
at all why we (FSVO "we") would even need a free alternative to
Bitkeeper.
People who really care about Bitkeeper being non-free can work
towards making a free alternative. Some people are doing exactly
that (I bet you won't see them in this thread though, they're
too busy doing useful stuff).
