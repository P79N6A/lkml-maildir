New-style init by itself shouldn't be hard to do, independent of a full
re-work...

Why not just run indent over the source before submitting.  That will
regularize this stuff, and ensure that you are close to
Documentation/CodingStyle.
Here is the command I use.  The first two options are the only really
importants ones...
indent -kr -i8 -npsl -pcs -l100 -lc120
(line length is 100 because line length 72/75/80 winds up wrapping long
printk and logic lines when typically the programmer didn't want them to
be wrapped)
