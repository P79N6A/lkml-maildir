ok.. i finally managed to get the exact file that causes the problems.
2.4.19-pre6 works.
2.4.19-pre7 doesnt: hangs right after "Ok, booting the kernel"
2.4.19-pre7 with pre6  arch/i386/kernel/setup.c   works ! 
as i dont have any highmem support configured and as i always have to provide 
the option   mem=511M   (due to 1MB shared video ram) i suspect that part of 
setup.c. but as i'm not a kernel hacker, any help would be appreciated.
note: any kernel prior to 2.4.3 was able to boot without the mem=511M option.

shows the diff which causes my problems..
anyone ?
