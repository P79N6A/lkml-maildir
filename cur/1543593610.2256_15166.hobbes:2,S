It does indeed. Pick any three words and take them out of context, however, 
and the result is utterly meaningless.
The paragraph from which you took those words is listed as one of three
_alternatives_. One of the alternatives does not require that the source be
made available to "any third party".

If the source is not distributed with the binary, you are correct.
If the source _is_ distributed with the binary, you are wrong. See option (a) below:

I may choose option (a). Which does not oblige me to give source to a third
party.
You can ship source with the binaries, _OR_ you must make sure the source is 
available to all third parties. You don't have to do both.
