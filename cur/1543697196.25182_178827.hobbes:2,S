yes i did.
i tried to suspend with disabled hdb write cache ( hdparm -W0 /dev/hdb ) and 
it suspended and resumed fine.
exept for my network device wasnt running...is there a way to fix this?
i`ll try to do   ifdown before suspending and ifup after resuming, but is 
there a way to resume properly without that?
