Neat. Or course, what I always thought was the neatest part of the
Perception was the hardware, but the pseudo-filesystem is cool too :)

Why not make it sort of a loopback or union type filesystem? Then you
could apply it to any existing filesystem.

How about writing most of the driver in userspace?  Coda and Arla network
filesystems have hooks in the kernel that can do the same thing. Pavel
Machek has something that does this

Probably neither, it sounds more like a filesystem. I think you could do
it in userspace by adding it to Midnight Commander and then either use it
directly or use Podfuk. Or write your own, using /dev/cfs0 or /dev/xfs0.
If you have a use for it, then it can't be a dumb idea...
