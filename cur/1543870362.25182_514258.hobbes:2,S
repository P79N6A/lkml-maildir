git-bisect gets royally confused on those ACPI merge branches around 
commit c0cd79d11412969b6b8fa1624cdc1277db82e2fe. Here are my test

 commit 3388c37e04ec0e35ebc1b4c732fdefc9ea938f3b: bad
 commit 9f4bd5dde81b5cb94e4f52f2f05825aa0422f1ff: bad
the results are totally reproducible (i re-tried a few of both the good 
and the bad commits), i.e. it's not a sporadic condition. Also, a number 
of the 'bad' commits have no dynticks stuff in them at all, so i'd 
exclude dynticks.
could someone suggest a sane way to go with this? Perhaps suggest 
specific commit IDs to test?
