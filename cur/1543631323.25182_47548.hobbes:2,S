Yes, I don't think it has actually ever been used.
It was done purely because Minix did it that way, and it wasn't even
compatible with Minix (I think Minix actually supoorted 2- and 4-byte
accesses by just doign 2- and 4-byte read/write calls, the Linux code
never did).
Everybody always used the iobitmap/iopl interfaces under Linux as far as I
know.
Anybody: if you've ever used /dev/ports, holler _now_.
