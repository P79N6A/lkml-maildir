Subject: ptrace in glibc vs. ptrace syscall

  I notice that the ptrace() function in glibc is hard-coded to
only deal with 32-bit data, and that it returns the data on
peeks (which goes against the man page for the ptrace syscall).
  For performance reasons, there are times when it would be handy
to do ptrace(PT_GETREGS, ...) or ptrace(PT_SETREGS, ...), i.e.,
read/write more than one word in one syscall what would
otherwise require ~32 syscalls.
  I figure there must be a good reason that the glibc interface
was written the way it was.  Does anyone know what it is?  :)  Is
there a good reason to not extend it to allow multi-word
transfers, say, if the ptrace command is higher than
PTRACE_DETACH (which would preserve full backwards compatibility)?
  Similarly, is there a good reason that the glibc ptrace doesn't
return the syscall return code for the PEEK operations?  It might
be a convenient programming paradigm, but having a function that
sometimes returns the syscall return code, and sometimes returns
a value (which may be -1), just seems Evil to me.  It's already
bitten me and others, since it violates the man page for ptrace!
  Thanks.
