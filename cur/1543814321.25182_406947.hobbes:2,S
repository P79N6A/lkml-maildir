The problem is that floppy controllers and other crufty hardware 
actually do need those slowing port operations to work reliably.  If you 
look at the usage of slow_down_io, you get scared pretty quick.  If you 
want your driver to use it, you have the option of defining 
REALLY_SLOW_IO in your C file, then suffix your I/O calls with _p.  The 
definition of SLOW_DOWN_IO actually used to be raw assembly instructions 
encapsulated in quotations.  I just realized this does actually change 
the semantics of drivers/net/de600.c, which really is the only driver 
which defines SLOW_IO_BY_JUMPING.
This usage of predefined macros in the driver causing port I/O semantics 
to change seems a little strange to try to wrap onto an alternate 
instruction interfaces, since it is dependent definitions local to each 
.C file, rather than global processor or derived feature bits.
The VMI call wrappers are very much similar to the alternate instruction 
interfaces - they just leave the alternative to be defined by the 
hypervisor.
