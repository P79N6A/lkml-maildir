Because you need to anyway. Things like shutdown/suspend need to sync the
caches, and that's a command that needs to go down the pipe to the disk.

The bio's are just fragment descriptors, they don't really stand on their
own. A bio needs a request in order to move down to the driver.
The request is the place where you find the actual command - the bio just
contains the fragment data of the command.
Of course, the "just" is a big simplification. Since a block command can
be a chain of hundreds of blocks which each actually have a lifetime of
their own, unlike the network later, the fragments are a lot more
complicated than a "skb_frag_t".
So bio's are complex entities in themselves, and they have a life of their
own. It's just that you cannot send a raw bio to a device - the device
wouldn't know what to do with it.
