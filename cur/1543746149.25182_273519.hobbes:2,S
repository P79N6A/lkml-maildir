I don't understand what you mean.  Do you mean you tried that approach and
rejected it for some reason?

That's OK.  A thread which is read()ing that page will either
a) decide that the page is outside i_size, and won't read it anyway or
b) decide that the page is inside i_size and will read the page's contents.
Still, I'd be inclined to update i_size after running ->commit_write.  It
looks like we can simply replace the call to __block_commit_write() with a
call to generic_commit_write().
But none of this has anything to do with truncate, and the patch which you
sent is playing around with the truncate code and appears to be quite
unrelated.  Did you send the correct patch?  If so, what is it designed to
do?
