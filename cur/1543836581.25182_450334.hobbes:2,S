Is there any reason to get following error on x86_64 using your patches?
 Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83
kernel /bzImage ro root=LABEL=/1 console=ttyS0,115200
earlyprintk=ttyS0,115200
   [Linux-bzImage, setup=0x1c00, size=0x24917c]
initrd /initrd-2.6.18-rc3.img
   [Linux-initrd @ 0x37e0d000, 0x1e25e7 bytes]
.
Decompressing Linux...
length error
 -- System halted
I can get i386 to boot fine.  I can't for the life of me figure out what I

Cheers,
Don
