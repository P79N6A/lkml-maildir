That's still not "weird" in the current sense.
We've always (well, for a long time) been able to handle a TASK_SIZE that 
has a 111..00000 pattern - and in fact we used to _depend_ on that kind of 
pattern, because macros like "virt_to_phys()" were simple bitwise-and 
operations. There may be some code in the kernel that still depends on 
that kind of bitwise operation with TASK_SIZE.
Your 3.875:0.125 split still fits that pattern, and thus doesn't create 
any new cases.
In contrast, a TASK_SIZE of 0xc1000000 can no longer just "mask off" the 
kernel address bits. And _that_ is what I meant with "strange value".
