On x86-64?  The GOT/PLT should stay in cache due to temporal locality. 
The x86-64 instruction set itself handles GOT-relative addressing rather 
well; what's a 1% loss on x86 is like 0.01% on x86-64, so I'm thinking 
100 times better?
I think I got this by `-fpic -pie` compiling nbyte benchmark versus 
fixed position, each with and without on 32-bit (which made about a 1% 
difference) and on 64-bit (which made a 0.01% difference).  It was a 
long time ago.
Still, yeah I know.  Complexity.
(You have the ability to textrel these things too, and just rewrite 
non-PIC, depending on how you feel about that)
