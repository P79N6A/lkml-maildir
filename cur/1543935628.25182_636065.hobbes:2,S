I reverted back to a clean install of slackware 12.0 after trying to
get it to fail again without luck, then i installed the 2.6.23.9
kernel and continued to use it regularly. Then a few minutes ago it I
restarted the computer because it had frozen again, the same way.
Except this time when rebooting the machine i got a kernel oops
message and it didn't boot completely. I could not copy it but I did
take a picture and now I have re-written the screen here(sorry about
the formating):
