OK, I think I see whats gone wrong here now.  Ralf, could you try
the patch below and check that it fixes your test case?
Badari, it looks like a regression from the "remove ->get_blocks()
support" patch - can you look over the fix below and confirm/deny
please?  
I'm definately seeing block mapping requests that are smaller than
the filesystem block size coming into XFS from direct-io.c - and it
looks like that eventually blows up in do_direct_IO if dio_remainder
becomes set and we could only map one block (if dio->blocks_available
was 1 after get_more_blocks).  We'll reduce that to zero right at the
end of the branch that calls get_more_blocks in do_direct_IO... and
mayhem ensues further on.
I have a couple of other .17 changes pending, if you could ACK this
I'll get it merged in for ya.
cheers.
