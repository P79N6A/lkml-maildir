	Hi all it's been some time since i last wrote to the list but now
i'm here again with a little problem with my modem and 2.2.x:
	Since 2.1.x my modem doesn't work with, if i try to initialize it
the program that i use tells me: unable to open /dev/modem (symbolic link
to /dev/ttyS2) and if i try using setserial /dev/modem it tells me: Device
or resource busy....my modem is a Rockwell fax modem PnP, for the PnP
think i use the bios to configure it but i dont't think it could be that
the problem because the bios configures also a SB AWE64 and there is till
now no problem, the driver loads ok...
	What can i do ?? it seems i'm the only one with this problem at
least here in mexico as nobody has said something about it...
	shoud i use better the kernel's pnp driver instead of the bios ???
	thanks for all the answers......
