I had problems with pre-release versions, but gcc-3.0 works fine for
me. I've got two boxes with K6s, this one running 2.4.6 (gcc-3) and the
other was running various fairly recent kernels through to 2.4.8-pre3 
compiled with gcc-3. I've seen strange errors with 2.4.7-ac5 (messages about
loss of clock data, and trying to compile gcc-2.95.3 gave sig 11), but I'm 
not ready to lay those at the compiler's door. (The test box has turned into
a linux from scratch system using gcc-2.95.3, it will be a little while 
before I get gcc-3 back up on it).
