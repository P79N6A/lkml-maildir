and  11:09am  up 11 days, 17:52,  8 users,  load average: 1.44, 1.15,
     0.77 uptime.
it seems like it is time to get at least the suggestions so far in the
mainstream kernel or at least in Alan's tree. (it's not clear if it has
been already included)
There are a few things that might be related though -- some slow network
performance but I am not sure if that is caused by the patch. I don't
think so but..; I also didn't hammer the whole day on sound to crash it.
typically, a flood ping, sound & backup --> crash within minutes and I
wanted to see how it performs (e.g. no crash) under normal loads. that
part succeeded.
if you like, I can start banging the machine on it's head now.
