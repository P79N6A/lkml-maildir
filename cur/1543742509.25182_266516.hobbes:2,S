Rather popl %eax or popl %edx then, a basic and MMX Pentium 
cannot pair:
	popl %ecx
	popl %ecx
for the simple reason that two instructions that have the
same destination register can't be paired.
OTOH, the other argument about reading or not memory in
this thread are a red herring. An additional memory read 
is cheap for data that is guaranteed to be in a cache line 
used by adjacent (in time) instructions.
Otherwise regparm(1) might even be better, movl %ecx,%eax is
the same size as push+pop, is faster, and may even reduce
stack usage by 4 bytes.
