Well, I settled on this option, and I've got something that seems 
to work.  The kmem walker hack is no longer needed, the llseek() 
VFS limitations are now a pretty moot point, and an 
obsolete/dangerous syscall got nudged further towards oblivion.
(Oh, and klogd no longer segv's on my EV56 box, which was really 
the point of this exercise to begin with. ;)
I've attached the patch below in case anyone is interested; I 
also sent it off to the sysklogd maintainers (finally found 
them).  Testing and constructive criticism is encouraged.
