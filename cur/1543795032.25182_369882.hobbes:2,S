maybe something like

?
Or basically any text that makes it clear that we didn't really try
that hard to stop the task.  We just gave up early.
I thought about adding /sys/power/timeout too, but realised that it is
way overkill for this.  Ideally, the default should never need to be
changed by anynoe.
I'd really prefer Dmitry's approach with an indefinite timeout on
resume, but I also understand your wish to avoid letting this code
know whether it's suspending or resuming.  No, I don't know how to
satisfy both of those requirements either.  Increasing the default
TIMEOUT to a pretty-sure-to-never-be-reached value is probably an
acceptable workaround.
