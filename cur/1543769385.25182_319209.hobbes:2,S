That is wired.  Can you try to edit a test.c contain just one line:
#include <stdarg.h>
run sparse on that test.c and see if you get any complain or not?
If you still get complain about file not found. Can you run
"strace -e trace=file ./check test.c" and show me the out put?

PS, here is what I get:
[chrisl@64m sparse-be]$ strace -e trace=file ./check test.h 
execve("./check", ["./check", "test.h"], [/* 26 vars */]) = 0
open("/etc/ld.so.preload", O_RDONLY)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=58983, ...}) = 0
open("/lib/tls/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)    = 3
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=1539996, ...}) = 0
open("test.h", O_RDONLY)                = 3
open("/usr/include/stdarg.h", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/usr/local/include/stdarg.h", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/3.2.2/include/stdarg.h", O_RDONLY) = 3
