Gee Jamie:
Maybe if you would or could read past comments in the thread, you'd catch
a clue, but let me quote myself from a few days back.
"Point, the API is being documented, sometimes not as timely as desired."
Clearly this acknowledges the API is a snapshot in time which is
published.  My past experience (now discounted by all) has observed, Linus
does not change, tries very hard to avoid changing, the kernel API during
a kernel series minor revsion number.
I think I will use one of my favorite viro quotes that I gotten many times
over the years.
"Sod Off!"
Cheers,
