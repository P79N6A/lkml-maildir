Ok. So there's absolutely no way to do that afterwards? It'd really be a
pity :-(
On the same subject: is there a reason why ICH6 gets "BAR0-3 ignored"
and always gets the legacy i/o ports and IRQ's assigned? I'd say there
is absolutely no need to be compatible in this way, the PCI code can
assign the IRQ and I/O ports as with any other PCI device?
