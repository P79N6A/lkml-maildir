How much will it gain?
It takes some kbuild hacking I think.
Also why should we care so much for multi directory modules?
They can be adopted as needed if we introduce it.
xfs and aic7xxx springs to my mind.
I do not recall we have modules that uses .o files created from another
kbuild file - which is the only situation that matters here.
