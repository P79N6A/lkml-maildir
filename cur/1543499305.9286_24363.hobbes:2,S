let me clarify for everyone's benefit -- the problem this patch fixes was
introduced in 2.3.6 with the modifications that removed the global lock
from the brk() system call.  the one line fix is provided for those brave
souls who want to try 2.3.6.
i'm glad to see the problem is fixed in 2.3.7 (pre).
