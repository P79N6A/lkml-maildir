in your case, the header and the image matched. There was no new image

the header is actually overwritten _prior_ to reading the image back. Or
it should be, obviously it was not in your casee.

But the failure you have seen now - failure to invalidate the resume
header - could also happen as long as we do not fix the reason for your
failure. If we fix it, we don't need additional security nets ;-)
But i have no idea what went wrong for you, i'll have a look at the code
but i doubt that i'll find much of interest.
One thing which would be interesting:
You don't eventually have multiple swap partitions?
