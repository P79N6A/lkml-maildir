The disktype program (
http://disktype.sourceforge.net
)  can be used to
decode the content type of a disk/filesystem image.  It recognises a
large amount of filesystems and partition types etc.  From a quick
glance, the documentation describes the concepts behind magic numbers
and superblock formats, and gives an overview of the filesystem
formats recognised.  If you're new to this, this is probably a
reasonable place to start.
