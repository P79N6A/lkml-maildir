dev_base list is historically not the cleanest part of Linux networking.
I've still spotted a place where the first device in dev_base list is assumed
to be loopback.  In early days we had more, now only one place or two...

Why would we want all network processing happen in a process context?

We just have too many layers in networking code, and FIB/routing
illustrates it well.

Certainly, dev_base list reorganization is not the crucial point in network
namespaces.  But it has to be done some way or other.
If people vote for a single list with skipping devices from a wrong
namespace, it's fine with me, I can re-make this patch.
I personally prefer per-namespace device list since we have too many places
in the kernel where this list is walked in a linear fashion,
and with many namespaces this list may become quite long.
