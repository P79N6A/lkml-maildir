I'm surprised it was reviewed, but I apologize for my harsh words in any 
case.

All the readq/writeq users at the moment don't give a crap about atomicity.

And:
1) a merge issue, we shouldn't be merging new procfs stuff
2) build breaks if CONFIG_ACPI is not set, but this driver is selected
3) shared interrupt causes very incorrect behavior, look at the last few 
lines of hpet_interrupt().
4) return EINVAL in open(2) if FMODE_WRITE isn't set.  Yes, vfs_write() 
will return EINVAL if you actually attempt to write(2), but other areas 
of the kernel check FMODE_WRITE.  I consider this a security bug, if the 
driver does not support writing, but does not prevent FMODE_WRITE from 
being set.  I do not know for sure, but I strongly suspect you can use 
this to cause incorrect behavior _somewhere_.
5) use of "__set_current_state" _and_ "current->state ="
6) race:
	spin-lock
	set HPET_IE
	spin-unlock
	doh!  we shouldn't have set HPET_IE
	spin-lock
	clear HPET_IE
	spin-unlock
