If you remove this line:
head-y += $(HEAD)
then head-y is undefined, and could therefore be removed, too. I dont know
what HEAD was used for, and where does it come from. But since the 2.4 code
uses head in a compareable way (i.e. only in that location with toetally
differen s tructure) I am not sure if it is not needed.
Can you explain what it was used for and why it can be removed now?
