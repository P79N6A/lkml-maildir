Humm.. originally they were marked as __initdata, but for CPU hotplug we call it
when processor gets hot plugged. So i changed it to __cpuinitdata so that when we use
cpu hotplug they stay resident.
the only reference is to that table is from acpi_processor_power_init(), that gets called 
currently only from acpi_processor_start().
the code is either compiled in kernel (which means it will be all thrown after free
init mem if !HOTPLUG_CPU) or if this is a module code, then __initdata/cpuinit doesnt 
make a difference.
possibly acpi_processor_start(), acpi_processor_power_init() etc should also be
__cpuinit, which would make the warning go away. 
Are there any others i missed Andi? maybe this is a general watch out comment, but 
he knows better.
