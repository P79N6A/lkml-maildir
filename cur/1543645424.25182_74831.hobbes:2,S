sure, it's just nice to get the message immediately.

I don't think so.  these check for the very strange list state that
results from double list_adds.  its an accident of the ordering of our
member assignments that result in a pretty strange looking list state
after a double_add.  it passes all the double-linked assertions
(list->{next,prev}->{prev,next} == list) but doesn't follow the rule
that both prev and next must point to list if either of them do.

try a double list_add().  these will pass, but the list is not a happy
camper :)

I'd love that.  It was just a bit of sugar to help the medicine go down.
