We have to read the inode size in the normal case so that we know if
the page is at EOF and is a partial page so we don't allocate past EOF in
block_prepare_write().  Hence it seems like a no-brainer to me to check
and error out on a page that we *know* is beyond EOF.
I can drop the check if you see no value in it - I just don't
like the idea of ignoring obvious boundary condition violations...
Cheers,
Dave.
