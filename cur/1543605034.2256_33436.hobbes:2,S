Just like mine.....
I would expect around 30Mb/sec when resyncing a single mirrored pair,
and slightly less than that on each if you are syncing two mirrored
pairs at once, as you would be getting close to the theoretical buss
max (to resync two pairs at once at 30Mb/sec each you would need to
but pushing 120Mb/sec over the buss, and I doubt that you would get
that from u160 in practice).
Thats a big more than the 20Mb/sec that you report, but less than the
60Mb/sec that you hoped for...
