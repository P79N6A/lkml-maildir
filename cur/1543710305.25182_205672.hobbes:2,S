Hi All,
I just upgraded to 2.6.4.  Is it normal for /dev/pts numbers to keep
increasing now?  With 2.6.3, I could log in or create an xterm and a pts
would be assigned.  Then when it was released, another process could reuse
that number.  Now, it seems it just keeps incrementing.  Has this changed?
I'm still using the legacy pty count option (256), if that matters.
Secondly, I have a regular 101-Keyboard attached through a Belkin KVM.
Upon booting in 2.6 (and into XFree86 4.2.1) the keyboard doesn't respond.
It never happened in the 2.4 series.  I can get around this by hitting
Control, Shift, Alt and the like during bootup and when it finally loads
the X login screen it works just fine.  Do I need to update my
xfree86.conf file?  Is there a kernel boot option I should be passing in?
I had crazy mouse action before I added "psmouse.proto=imps" to my kernel
boot options.
Let me know if anyone needs more info.
Thanks,
-Ed
