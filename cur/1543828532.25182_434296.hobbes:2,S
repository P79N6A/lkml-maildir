Subject: [2/4] ACPI C-States: bm_activity improvements
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Do not assume there was bus mastering activity if the idle handler didn't
get called, as there's only reason to not enter C3-type sleep if there is
bus master activity going on. Only for the "promotion" into C3-type sleep
bus mastering activity is taken into account, and there only current bus
mastering activity, and not pure guessing should lead to the decision on
whether to enter C3-type sleep or not.
Also, as bm_activity is a jiffy-based bitmask (bit 0: bus mastering activity
during this juffy, bit 31: bus mastering activity 31 jiffies ago), fix the
setting of bit 0, as it might be called multiple times within one jiffy.
