70MB is still very bad, naturally.
There are other ways in which users can do this sort of thing - passing
fd's across sockets, allocating zillions of pagetables come to mind.  But
we don't want to add more.
Possible options:
- Add a new rlimit for the number of kevent fd's
- Add a new rlimit for the amount of kevent memory
- Add a new rlimit for the total amount of pinned kernel memory.  First
  user is kevent.
- Account a kevent fd as being worth 100 regular fds, so the naughty user
  hits EMFILE early (ug).
A new rlimit is attractive, and they're easy to add.  Problem is, userspace
support is hard (I think).  afaik a standard Linux system doesn't have
global and per-user rlimit config files which are parsed and acted upon at
login.  That would make rlimits more useful.
