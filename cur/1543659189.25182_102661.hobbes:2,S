goto out_path_release is finer to you ?!?  :)

I think you have no idea of the mole of the linux kernel and the number of daily patches
the mantainers receive ...
I'm also a beginner, and me too at the very first time hated the goto (every one have
told me they are evil !!) but after aving taken a look at the kernel and reading
LinuxDevice Driver I think that the style the linux kernel is coded is cryptic for
beginners, but it is perfect !
It is a wonderful experience to browse the linux kernel sources .. and every time I
didn't understand why a thing was done in such a way .. well I discover later (with
experience) that it was done in the best way it could ever be done !!!
