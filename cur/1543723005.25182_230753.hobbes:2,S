I'm not sure if I'm niggling over terminology, or pointing out a
significant misunderstanding: but /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory 0
(indeed the default) is not what I call strict non-overcommit: that's 2.
All settings (0, 1, 2) maintain the Committed_AS count shown in
/proc/meminfo; but only /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory 2 totals and
limits reservations using it.  1 imposes no limit.  0 checks that the
particular "reservation" could plausibly be made available now, but
without considering the total: so allows any number of concurrent
maximum reservations - traditional relaxed Linux behaviour, not strict.
(2 came along much later, yes the naming and numbering are both horrid.)
