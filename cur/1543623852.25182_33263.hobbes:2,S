Note that there really are two kinds of rwlocks: rwlocks with read
priority, and rwlocks with write priority.  They're actually fairly
different operations.  I guess one can envision other schemes, too,
but that's the main distinction.
Neither is particularly hard to implement, however, it's probably
better if they are considered different types (perhaps we can call the
ones with write priority "wrlocks" instead of "rwlocks").
