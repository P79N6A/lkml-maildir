I can do that.  I have the cache directory path and the cache tag name both
available as strings.

Where are you envisioning this going?  In SELinux, in the LSM core or in
cachefiles?  I was also wondering if I could generalise it to handle all cache
types, but the permissions checks are probably going to be quite different for
each type.  For instance, CacheFiles uses files on a mounted fs, whilst CacheFS
uses a block device.

Mapping it to something similar sounds reasonable, though I'd quite like
something general, so that I can check for any type of cache coming up.
Also, with your multiple cache example, how would I bring each cachefilesd
daemon up in a different context so that it could handle a different cache with
a different context?

Actually, that's not something I had considered, but there's no particular
reason that files in the cache have to be owned by root specifically; nor is
there a reason why cachefilesd needs to run as root.  The main thing is that
the files are owned by whatever user the daemon runs as.  It'd mean creating
another special user for it, but we do that all the time...

Gotcha.
