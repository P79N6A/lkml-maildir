The rc-to-rc shortlog is usually helpful. That way, I can see whether a
particular fix that I am interested in/involved with has already been
merged - or not and its needs some reminder. And the 2.6.x -> 2.6.y-rc1
shortlog for seeing whether patches, should I have decided to send
anything, actually went in. All other logs can be omitted from the mail
announcements. I still prefer to have all logs, as usual, both short
and long, via http (perhaps compressed for your pleasure), because
cloning a git is not always possible (think of public terminals) or
feasible (cloning does take a while, and longer on slower links).
