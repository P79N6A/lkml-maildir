This ends up in Linus' changelog, so "we've previously discussed"
is not okay here. Missing signed-off. What is benefit of this?
swsusp part looks okay, but will Andrew like the generic part? I guess
I'd prefer to postpone this one (unless we are last user of
PageReserved) -- I do not see too big benefit and there's potential
for breakage.
