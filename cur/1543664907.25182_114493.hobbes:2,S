Hi,
I have some issues here:
Plextor PX-W4824TA 1.03 as hdc (no hdd)
VIA KT133
00:07.1 IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586B PIPC Bus Master IDE (rev 10) (prog-if 8a [Master SecP PriP])
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32
        I/O ports at ffa0 [size=16]
        Capabilities: [c0] Power Management version 2
When I try to enable DMA (hdparm -d1 or hdparm -d1 -X66), hdparm -tT
chokes, SuSE k_athlon-2.4.19-167. FreeBSD-5 (with atapicam) is fine and
uses UDMA33.
SuSE's kernel seems to be fine on a different hardware (VIA KT333 +
Toshiba SD-M1612).
I've tried 2.4.21-pre5 which crashes on boot, I haven't yet been able to
go fishing for the Ooops and decode it (I have serial console here, so
it's just a matter of finding the time to do that).
ide-scsi makes no difference (not that I had expected that).
Which kernel version should I try next before thinking about this for
longer?
