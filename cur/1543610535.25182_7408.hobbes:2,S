Al,
I have seen this as well during testing, except in my case, it results in a
hard hang of sorts that does not respond to signals.  I can make it show up
easily by doing a copy accross mount points in low memory conditions, if any
of this helps.  Sounds like you've got a good handle on it, though.
Jeff
