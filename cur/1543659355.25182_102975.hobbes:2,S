Hi-

|        head:   .word 0             # current head
|        track:  .word 0             # current track

If you change those to bytes to save 3 bytes of space, and then you
change all of the instructions that load or store those values to 16-bit
registers, do you have a net saving of space?
Or you load/store them to 8-bit registers and rewrite the code, what
happens?
| 2. Near line 272 we have "movw    $7, %bx" but the documentation I've
|     been able to find about the "int 0x10" BIOS call says that for service
|     code 0xe (write character and advance cursor), it does not take an

|     this movw instruction superfluous ?
Perhaps, or perhaps on some particular system it was found to be needed.
We don't have a fully indexed changelog history of each line AFAIK.
Ralf Brown's interrupt page for this function says:
  BH = page number
  BL = foreground color (graphics modes only)
(see 
http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-0106.htm
)
Or it could be important to clear BH and setting BL to 7 was just safe.
