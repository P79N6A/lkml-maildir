Yep.

It makes a lot more sense to account for all shrink attempts: it is necessary
to know how the reclaiming process is behaving over time. Thats why I wondered
about using "=" instead of "+=" in your patch.

My feeling is that changing /proc/slabinfo format might break userspace
applications.

Yep.

Well, page_state contains most of the reclaiming statistics - its scope
is broader than "struct page" information.
To me it seems like the best place.
