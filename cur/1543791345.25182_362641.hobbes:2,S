Hi Ingo,
With patch-2.6.14-rt1 I notice below problems:
1).
I'm observing a major system slowdown after several hours of uptime.
This is a normal workstation (running kde, gcc, etc.).
Once I got on all open terminals an error message:
`VFS: file-max limit 51078 reached` and it freezed.
2).
During `scp bigfile to another machine` I get an oops:

Any ideas?
Reagrds,
Paweł.
