Actually Linus had pretty good arguments to make this per-architecture:
the list will be different on each architecture.
(eg my first patch had it more generic; but Linus asked it to be per
arch, and I agree with the reasons he gave)
Also I doubt it can be enabled "blindly" for all architectures; I expect
more to need hacks similar to the x86_64 entry.S fix before it can
work...
