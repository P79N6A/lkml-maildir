I talked to Adam about this yesterday.  He convinced me that we
shouldn't rely on device ordering to determine names.  For one
thing, that would make threaded probing difficult.  Better to
rely on a unique identifier, and let udev take care of user-space
persistent naming issues.
I don't think udev solves the problem for built-in drivers like
serial, where you need to be able to do "console=ttyS0" and have
it mean something predictable.  But possibly we could expose the
_DDN and/or _UID through PNP and have 8250_pnp give a hint about
what the ttyS device should be when it registers with 8250.
For example, 8250_pnp could have rules like "COM1 should always
be ttyS0" or "a port at 0x3f8 should always be ttyS0."
That doesn't help with Yinghai's PCI root ordering issue, of course.
But I hope that can be addressed with udev, because there's not so
much need for a persistent kernel name.  If that's not enough, can
you explain more about the problem?
