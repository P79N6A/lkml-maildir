Can you describe the nature of the cpu-hotplug tests you're running?  I'd
be fairly staggered if the kernel was able to survive a full-on cpu-hotplug
stress test for more than one second, frankly.  There's a lot of code in
there which is non-hotplug-aware.  Running a non-preemptible kernel would
make things appear more stable, perhaps.
iirc Pavel did some testing a month or two ago and was seeing userspace
misbehaviour?

It's surprising that AMD and Intel CPUs behave differently.  Also a good
start on diagnosing things.
