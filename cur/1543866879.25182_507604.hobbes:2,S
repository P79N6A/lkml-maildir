It turns out this patch is in fact bug-fix.
I didn't notice that we already have flush_fork(delayed_work) calls!
This means that
	workqueue-make-cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue-work-on-idle-dwork.patch
	and this patch
should go just after
	implement-flush_work.patch
Sorry for inconvenience, please apply.
Oleg.
