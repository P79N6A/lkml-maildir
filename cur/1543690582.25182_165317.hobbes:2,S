Big deal, 99% of ide-scsi use is for cd burning. But yes, it should be
fixed. I'm not disagreeing, I just don't think it's a high prio item.
And apparently noone else thinks so either, if not it would have been
fixed a long time ago (it's been broken for how long now?)

Just needs someone to do it. Once it bugs someone enough, that someone
will do it. Until then, it remains broken :)
