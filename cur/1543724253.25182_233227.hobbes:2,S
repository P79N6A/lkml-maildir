Hi,
Can anyone please tell me how to make cdrecord that is shipped with SuSE 9.1 
work with something like /dev/hdc _without_ ide-scsi?  I'm having strange 
problems with cdrecord which is hanging my system sollid that I'd like to 
reproduce without the SCSI-related stuff getting in the way.
Yours,
rjw
