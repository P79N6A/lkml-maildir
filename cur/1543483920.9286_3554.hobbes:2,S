I am paranoid enough I know...
The C compiler is allowed to do generate code like this in the asm of
queue_task():
	bh->next = 123;
	bh->next = old_list;
if it will do that you'll see the wrong pointer in run_task_queue().

The pointer is seen by the run_task_queue() loop.

Ah, I wasn't aware of that... Could you tell me where is it?

PS. It's a not so obvious improvement to me though ;)
