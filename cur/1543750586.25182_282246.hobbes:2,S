Hello,
Upon bootup, kernels 2.6.9 and 2.6.10 do not respond to keyboard input 
(e.g., I enter a few chars at the prompt but I see nothing).  I can SSH 
into the system, though, but I don't know what to do from there. I used 
the .config from my 2.6.7 kernel, which works properly (I did run 'make 
oldconfig'). In all .config files, I have the following:
  CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBOARD=y
  CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=y
  # CONFIG_KEYBOARD_SUNKBD is not set
  # CONFIG_KEYBOARD_LKKBD is not set
  # CONFIG_KEYBOARD_XTKBD is not set
  # CONFIG_KEYBOARD_NEWTON is not set
So that looks OK... I also SSH'd into the system, did a 'cat 
/dev/input/event0' and typed on the system's keyboard, but 'cat' 
remained silent. Perhaps there is a better way to see if the system is 
recognizing the keyboard input (or even seeing the keyboard 
itself).  I give up.. what am I doing wrong???
Thanks,
Roey Katz
