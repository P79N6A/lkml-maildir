At the moment, I don't have a burner on a 2.6.0 machine, however, why is
ide-scsi depreciated?  On every PC I have that has an ide cd drive, I use
ide-scsi.  I like the fact that scd0 is the cdrom drive.  Instead of
guessing if it's hdb hdc or hdd (in the case of this laptop, the dvd was hdb
and the modular cdrw was hdc).
On a side note, has anyone had any luck with Acard's SCSIDE AEC-7722 adapter
on dvd burners?  I was planning on this adapter on an optorite dd0401 dvd
burner.
