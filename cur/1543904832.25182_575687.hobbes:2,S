Will be very little and swap-prefetch at least in its current form needs 
more than very little to start doing anything:
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/swap-prefetch/2.6.21-swap_prefetch-38.patch

However, okay, let's just ignore that and pretend it kicks in even with the 
little free memory updatedb itself left behind when it finished:

The story now again breaks down here. Over at:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/9/112
we have swap-prefetch's author saying:
| swap prefetch stores the data at the tail end of the lru list which
| means that even if you do want to use that ram for something else,
| the prefetched pages will be immediately dropped.
So those aging VFS caches will never be replaced by anything prefetched it 
seems and any prefetching stops after the couple of pages that updatedb 
itself freed have been taken again.
A subsequent bit in that same message reads:
| It can't help the updatedb scenario. Updatedb leaves the ram full and
| swap prefetch wants to cost as little as possible so it will never
| move anything out of ram in preference for the pages it wants to swap
| back in.
which I'll take as confirmation.

Also file-backed pages (such as the program binaries itself). However, _if_ 
prefetching were to take place, I'd be okay assuming it helps.

Given swap-prefetch's focus on being as free as possible I don't believe it 
should hurt any. And yes, it's always going to help _some_ workload shifts 
and as far as I'm concerned is a "makes sense" kind of tweak even if it's 
not the be all end all so again, not against swap-prefetch or its merger or 
anything...

As to the (*) above -- now that I actually know about the "swappiness" 
thing, shouldn't setting that to 0 around updatedb runs really be quite 
effective and if it's not, is there anything to be fixed there? Bjoern 
Steinbrink (added to CC) earlier in this thread tried that and said stuff 
went weird.
