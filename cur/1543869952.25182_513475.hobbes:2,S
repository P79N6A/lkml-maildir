Sure - I used variations of the following job file (e.g. engine=syslet-rw,
iodepth=20000).
Also the io scheduler on my system is set to Anticipatory by default.
FWIW it is a 4 way SMP (PIII, 700MHz)
; aio-stress -l -O -o3 <1GB file>
[global]
ioengine=libaio
buffered=0
rw=randread
bs=64k
size=1024m
directory=/kdump/suparna
[testfile2]
iodepth=64
iodepth_batch=8

Just tried it now : 9,027KiB/s

True, at least some of this helps us gain a little more understanding
about the boundaries and how to tune it to be most effective.
