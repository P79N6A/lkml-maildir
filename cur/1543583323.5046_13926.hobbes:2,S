I assume this worked in 2.2.18 or some earlier 2.2.x?
Hmm, I'll have to test 2.2.19pre14 (16?) myself tonight. It did work for
me in earlier 2.2.19pre versions, and the code is "identical" to other
drivers here.
This page suggests possible bios problems.

You could also try Donalds original via-rhine module. The largest
difference between that and the one in the kernel is how it does pci
probing.
