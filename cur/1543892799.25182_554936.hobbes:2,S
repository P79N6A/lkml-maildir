I just counted, I can get 380 chars on 1 screen, if I let it straddle
the two monitors I have then I can get 760 chars.

I agree, its easier on the eyes to have dense columns of text to read
than having to scan all over the place. More so, its more economical of
screen-estate as well, a few long lines take up valuable space which
could otherwise have been used to create more columns (yes, from the guy
sitting behind the two 24" screen).
I usually work with 4 columns side by side per screen, that gives me
about 92x110 columns. Its easy on they eye (it need not wander all over
the place to read stuff) and it can handle the occasional line that
exceeds 80 chars (they never exceed very far - yes there are
exceptions :-( )
