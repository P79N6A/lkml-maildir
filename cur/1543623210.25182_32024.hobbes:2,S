No - you think you want to dirty the pages - you want to account the address
space. What you want to do is run 2.4.18ac3 and do
	echo "2" > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
which on a good day will give you overcommit protection. Your map requests
will fail without the pages being dirtied and the extra swap that would
cause. It knows about tmpfs too but not ramfs, ramdisk or ptrace yet
