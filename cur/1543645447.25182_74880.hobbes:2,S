Tim would know better there since he removed it, but iirc it had something 
to do with the BARs used, hmm your card has the same PCI id and is serial 
neutered to an extent, what happens if you treat it as if it really does 
have both serial ports there? Does it still work without causing other 
problems so you can safely ignore it? FYI, Interrupt driven works great 
for me.

link order shouldn't affect the decision seeing as it affects all 
parport_serial anyway. You might have to wait it out and see what Tim/Ed 
have to say but i do have patches for both lying about.
