Len, maybe it sounds dramatic and/or extreme, but how about getting rid
of IRQs and just having GSI-vector pair.
I intuitively think that would be possible (not that I have all the
details lined up :)
And this would probably take away confusing IRQ abstraction out once and
for all? I think something like that is done in ia64.
