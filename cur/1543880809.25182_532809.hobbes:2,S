Interesting, that rings a bell here.
I wonder why we dont use this in alloc_large_system_hash().
(if __get_free_pages(GFP_ATOMIC, order) is used instead of alloc_bootmem() or __vmalloc())
We currently loose 1/4 of space on tcp hash table for example, because sizeof(inet_ehash_bucket) is not a power of 2.
Is it really possible to allocate an order-10 page, then release part of it (say an order-8 subpage) ?
