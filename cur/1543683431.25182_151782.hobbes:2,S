I sent a similar patch based on your older one to the Gentoo maintainers 
a couple of days ago. Did you notice how the module reference counting 
(MOD_INC/MOD_DEC) seems to have moved out of their wrapper into the 
binary module (possible GPL violation) or removed completely (oops 
waiting to happen)? I wonder why.
To be safe, I added the refcounting back where it was in previous 
versions. Anyway, thanks for making these patches.
