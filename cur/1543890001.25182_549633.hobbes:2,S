From the exec(3) man page:
   "The first argument, by convention, should point to the
    file name associated with the file being executed."
since the man page calls it a convention, so do I.

As I pointed out, if you wanted to trust the argv[0] value
(which I understand AppArmor makes no claims about) and you
wanted to use the argv[0] value to determine application
behavior (which several people claim is a Bad Idea) you could
use Name Based Access Control to provide different access
to the common binary. As I pointed out before, that's a lot
of "if's".

Fair enough, I don't believe that an argv[0] check ought to
be used as a security mechanism. I am not convinced that everyone
would agree with us.
