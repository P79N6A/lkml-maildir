The code in this file implements 2 sets of services:  
1) allocating unique qp identifiers (type integer).  This is the
c2_alloc struct and functions.
2) maintaining a sparsely allocated array of ptrs indexed by the qp
identifier.  This allows for quick mapping to the qp structure ptr given
the qp identifier.  This is the c2_array struct and functions.
I believe I can use an IDR tree to provide both of these services.
Steve.
