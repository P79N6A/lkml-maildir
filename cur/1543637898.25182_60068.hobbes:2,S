Well, we plan to submit it for 2.5, but no work has been done in that
direction yet.  I believe Peter has an agreement-in-principle with Al
on this, but I don't think Al has seen the code yet.  We want to make
sure that we don't need any major changes before it is submit it.  So
far the current patch is working well for us.
Cheers, Andreas
