Then let me repeat again:
distclean and mrproper is combined today. They do exactly the same.
So what was deleted by make distclean in 2.40 is still deleted by
make distclean in 2.5.47.
What has happened is that mrproper and distclean now deletes the sum of files
they delted before.

Which is unrelated. Thats due to the module work that Rusty is performing.
Relevant part of his patch: (from linus-BK-latest)

See, modversion support is taken out.
And when you try make dep, you get "nothing to be done" because
CONFIG_MODVERSION is not set to y.
If it was set in your previous .config, then the implicit make oldconfig
takes care of deleting it.
Try:
$grep MODVERSION .config
and see yourself.

Getting modules to work is one step in that direction, and making
modversion obsolete is obviously a side-effect.

Let me know which files are left, and I will take care they are delted.
I have tested this many times on my own setup, and here I have no files
left hanging after make distclean/mrproper
If there are any error, I will be happy to fix it.

I have explained how I would like it to work - any comments on that proposal?
Anyway this kind of changes always go throuh kai - and he is busy doing
other stuff at the moment. So I will do an eventual patch later.
