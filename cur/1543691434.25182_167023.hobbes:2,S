Unverified (due to lack of hardware) report from a user:
Updating from 2.4.22 to 2.4.23-pre4 breaks networking with an onboard VIA 
Rhine II chip.
It seems to transfer about 2 kB of data, then stall forever.
At a first look I'm not seeing anything wrong in the new code, but then 
it's already 3:20 AM ;)
