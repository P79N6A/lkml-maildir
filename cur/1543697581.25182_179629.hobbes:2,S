Since posting that, I've installed xawtv-3.88-1 with this 
configuration:
./configure  --enable-xfree-ext  --enable-xvideo  --enable-alsa \ 
--enable-mmx --enable-zvbi  --enable-xft
But it seems to have made no diff, clicking on the ADD button in the 
channel editor window is still equal to a "quit" command.  Hints 
anyone?
