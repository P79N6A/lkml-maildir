In the 64bit capable generation I don't know of any run in spec 
(except for multinode systems and there was one overclocked
system where the cores got unsync, but overclocking is an operator error)

There was a patch from google for trap -- trapping RDTSC for syncing
on demand. I'm not sure that was the right strategy though.

The trouble is that it's good enough on many systems, probably 
on those that are being developed on.
Anyways I don't feel very strongly about this -- i guess taking
it out would be fine.

Because gettimeofday is too slow.
