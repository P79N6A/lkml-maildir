Since it's possible that pings will actually change the problem rather
than measure it, I'll tcpdump for a while and see if that tells me
anything. I suspected network problems, since tcp has priority over udp in
some places.
I looked at the code last night, but I don't see anything explaining a
ping making things better. Something getting flushed?
