A couple of things to try:
 - Put in both sticks, try booting from a distribution and pass the
   bootloader "mem=960M" as a parameter at the prompt.
 - Just to make sure it's not a memory problem, grab memtest86
   (
http://www.memtest86.com/
) and try running it for a few hours.
   Unlikely, but you never know.
