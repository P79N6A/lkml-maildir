And plus you've had that one sitting around since 2005, hats off for
nailing the issue from way out.  Sorry for missing the action, I was 
elsewhere.  Niggles begin here.
I'm not sure I like the additional task_struct encumbrance when the
functions themselves could sort it out, albeit with an API change
affecting a gaggle of md and dm drivers.
Hopefully there are other users of the bio list fields, otherwise I
would point out that a per-queue stack is less memory than two
per-bio fields.  I didn't go delving that far.
The pointer to the description of the barrier deadlock is not right, it
points to the problem report when it really out to point to the
definitive analysis and include a subject line, because list archives
come and go:
   [PATCH] block: always requeue !fs requests at the front
   
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/537473
Is there a good reason why we should not just put the whole
analysis from Tejun Heo in as a comment?  It is terse enough.
In other words, looks good to me :)
Regards,
Daniel
