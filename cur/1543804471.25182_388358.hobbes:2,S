No I think you're right. I'm not sure why this doesn't oops but I
thought it was the (main) reason others wanted to get rid of this
convoluted code earlier on. I see nobody else is planning to do anything
about it though, so I figure I must have missed the reason why it isn't
a problem.
But either way I don't think the code actually _does_ anything, even if
its bugginess doesn't actually lead to a bug.
