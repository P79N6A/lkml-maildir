You didn't care to read what I said? I said to remove those sym-links.
They must be replaced by headers that were in-use around the time
the C library code was compiled, preferably the exact same headers.
There must not be any sym-link in the /usr/include/... directories
pointing to any kernel headers. That way, you can add new kernels
without ever screwing up your compiler.
When you compile modules, NO 'C' runtime library components are
used at except, possibly, stddef.h or stdarg.h. These are
automatically searched in the `gcc -print-file-name=include`
directory. You can see what's there by executing:
ls `gcc -print-file-name=include`. You can guarantee that
only the files you want are searched by using -nostdinc on
the gcc command line. Of course if you do this, stddef.h
won't be found, if needed so you would need to add the
that directory back to the search-list.
Cheers,
