You are wrong.  ;o)
If you use a swap file, you can add/remove them on the fly as
needed.  If you want dynamic sizing swap, you'll have to write
some sort of daemon which checks every so often the amount of
used swap and compares against 2 threshholds, a high water mark,
and a low water mark.  If the low water mark is reached, add some
swap sized based on a fixed granularity, or else use some more
complex algorithm.  After so much time has expired, and the swap
space used decreases, have the most newly added space disappear.
man swapon
man swapoff
man mkswap
Create a simple daemon in C to do the dirty work.  Shouldn't be
too difficult, but swap files are SLOW compared to partitions,
and dynamically creating them and destroying them will likely end
up with highly fragmented swapspace, and the performance of your
swapping system will be reminiscent of Windows 95 which, by
default uses dynamically resizing temp swap space via file
access.  Rediculously slow indeed.
