That *is* problem. mainline kernel is not expected to carry stuff like
that. We do not have bash as a kernel module. Not even gzip. And we
should not have ascii-art, too.

Yes, and then kill all the other plugins from mainline patches and
submit that. That would work. Ouch and that means no ugly hooks all
over the place in whatever goes into mainline.... and preferably no
plugin interface, too.

Ugh, ouch. So if /dev/ is not there you just go and walk over user's
filesystem? Please, let's forget the asciiart.
