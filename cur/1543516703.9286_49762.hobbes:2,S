You should read:
'Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual'
'Volume 3: System programming guide'
'7.2.2'
And then, may-be, you will understand, as I did, that a P6 processor is
consistent with itself when optimizing reads ahead writes and no more.
Reading more, you may end up thinking, as I did, that 'serialization'
followed by a LOCK seem to be the only way for ensuring that some 'read'
from some location will not break consistency around some 'semaphore' in
SMP. 
The LOCK prefix is doing exactly what we expect from the 'unlock' of a
spinlock on a P6, in my opinion.
