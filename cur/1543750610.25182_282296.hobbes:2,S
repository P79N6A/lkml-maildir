At Con's request I've taken over responsibility for plugsched but I've 
been away visiting relatives for the last week or so and, therefore, I'm 
a little behind.  I hope to release a plugsched patch for 2.6.10 in the 
next few days with a (work in progress) modification to share a lot more 
code between schedulers so that the amount of work required to implement 
new schedulers is reduced.
