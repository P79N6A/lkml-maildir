Hi Andries,
If that's what's been decided... I presume for backwards compatability,
but it does seem rather odd though.  After all, it seems like O_RDONLY
is supposed to safeguard someone from accidently overwriting a file.
Otherwise why not automatically open everything read/write?  Going down
the same path, what's next: automatically write enabling a file which
has been openend for O_RDONLY the next time someone performs a write
operation on it? ;-)
Take care,
John

This was just recently discussed, and it became clear that the
parenthetical
remark only led to confusion. It has been deleted. Instead
       The (undefined) effect of O_RDONLY | O_TRUNC various among
       implementations.  On  many  systems  the  file is actually
       truncated.
has been added.
