Of the list of poeple here, only Alan was present with the discussion of
the terms of how the FASTTRAK SCSI-Emulation API to ATA was defined.
Since you are not in the position to define the terms of how the
interaction between the two subsystems work, you have no clue that
building it into the kernel will fail!
Second read the causes about "COMMERIAL INTENT", somewhere around section
7 paragraph 3.
I have defined the terms that are acceptable to a binary module that
incorporates GPL code of MINE!  This I DEFINE THE TERMS, and they are
module only!
