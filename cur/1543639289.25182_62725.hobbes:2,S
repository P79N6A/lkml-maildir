I suspect it's a bug in the kernel.
It sounds like the printer is NAKing all of the transfers while it's
busy flushing out the data sent to it. This is to be expected because it
can only store so much data and sending data is MUCH faster than it can
print it.
I think the problem is that the printer driver has a timeout. I don't
think it should. It just doesn't make sense in this case. I say let the
device NAK as long as it wants. It's the applications job to decide if
it's been too long or not.
