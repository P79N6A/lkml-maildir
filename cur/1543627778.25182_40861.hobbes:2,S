Hi all!
Sorry if it is a little bit offtopic. As I posted before the company I am 
working for would like me to write a linux driver. It's wunderful. But as the 
other companies it wouldn't like to publish the source code and wants to 
distribute it only in binary format.
Of course I prefer the GPL.  How can I change the company's mind about it?
I planned the driver as the following:
The DRIVER itself (handles interrupt, pci resources, memory access etc)
A LIB, used by applications. In real life it implements the functions of the 
card.
First question: Is it possible to write the driver in GPL and then develop a 
binary only LIB? (I think yes because the LIB is in user space)
The company may accept the GPL-d driver, but not the GPL-d (or LGPL-d) LIB.
What are the advantages when the driver is GPL? How can I change the company's 
mind to publish the driver in GPL? (or if someone has got idea about the LGPL 
LIB too...)
Now the driver doesn't use any GPL-only symbols...
THX
Gabor
