Hang on here... this is bullsh*t.  The real-mode code should not be
relocated if the cmd_line_ptr field is set.  If you don't want to pass
a command line, set cmd_line_ptr to an empty string "".  There should
be no need for an additional protocol here; in fact, having two
protocols only means the boot loader has to do both, in effect, so
what's the point?!?

It's still a bad idea, for several reasons:
a) Adds to the number of configurations that have to be tested, for
   absolutely no good reason.
b) It may be OK for the Linux kernel proper, but it is *NOT*
   acceptable for some other programs that use the Linux boot
   protocol.
