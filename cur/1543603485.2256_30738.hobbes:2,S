Agreed, althought that's not a user-space solution. Is there any
fundamental reason why no-one's implemented pselect()/ppoll() for Linux
yet?

Yes, that would probably solve the situation in question, provided that
siglongjmp() is portably safe. (A comment on LKML in the past suggested
that it's not safe on cygwin, for example.)

One advantage of the pollable /proc/<pid>, (when combined with
do_notify_parent() waking tsk->exit_chldwait) is that any process can
check for the exit of any other process (not just direct children) in a
select()/poll() call.
