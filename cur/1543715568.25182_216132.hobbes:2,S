kill acpid and
# cat /proc/acpi/event
to see what the events are.
We we are working on a GPE issue related to spurious
ACPI interrupts right now, but I'd actually expect
2.4.26 to get _fewer_ acpi interrupts than 2.4.25, not more.
Re: fan running more
it would be interesting if you notice a temperature difference
between the releases in /proc/acpi/thermal...
eg.
cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature
temperature:             37 C
FAN isn't always controlled by ACPI.  If it is, you'll see it
in the dmesg like this:
ACPI: Power Resource [PFAN] (off)
In either case, it may be that we're running hotter (say idle
isn't working right), or we're running the fan more often by mistake.
For idle, you can compare the /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power
file in the two releases to see if one release is getting into
a deeper power-saving state than the other.
Eg, this centrino box isn't getting into C3 because USB is active.
cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power
active state:            C2
default state:           C1
bus master activity:     ffffffff
states:
    C1:                  promotion[C2] demotion[--] latency[000]
usage[00000010]
   *C2:                  promotion[C3] demotion[C1] latency[001]
usage[00370077]
    C3:                  promotion[--] demotion[C2] latency[085]
usage[00000000]
