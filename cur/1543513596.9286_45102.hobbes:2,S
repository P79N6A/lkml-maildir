Hi,
I was trying to set resource limits on a SMP machine with kernel
2.2.13pre18. A couple of e-mails from this list showed me how to
do it using the pam module pam_limits. Things seemed to work fine
for programs like Netscape and gimp (they would report out of memory
conditions and such) but a simple program mallocing chunks of memory
is still able to exhaust all memory (including swap space). The kernel
also still seems keen on killing programs other then the one causing
havoc.
Is this a kernel problem or is the pam module at fault?
Is there anything I could do to get this working?
/offtopic
Could someone please explain to me the exact meaning of
the several memory limits? The way I figured it out is
like this:
data+stack = total memory in ram + swap
resident(1)   = total memory in ram
memlock = data can't be swapped ever ??
It also seems that shared memory is subtracted from the
resident(2) memory (reported by top) so that the limit is actually:
resident(2) -s hared < resident(1)
How off am I?
Thanks in advance,
Rui Sousa
