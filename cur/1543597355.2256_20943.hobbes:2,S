But this assumes that it is the most-recently-written sector/block
which gets lost in a power failure.
The disk will be reordering writes - so when it fails it may have
written the commit block but *not* the data which that block is
committing.
You need a barrier or a full synchronous flush prior to writing
the commit block.  A `don't-reorder-past-me' barrier is very much
preferable, of course.
