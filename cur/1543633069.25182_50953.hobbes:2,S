Subject: [BUG] 2.5.20: APIC PCI IRQ remapping still lost.

Hi,
This is an old one: been there since early 2.5. The IRQ remapping
table generated by my BIOS is taken over by the APIC, but (afaics) not by
the pci data structures. Result: Drivers claim the wrong IRQ line (as
can be seen in /proc/interrupts). No sound, not network, no SCSI, which
means: no root filesystem and thus no boot :(
At the moment I "fix" this by telling the kernel to ignore the APIC, this
is not the preferred way to go imho.
I also reported this somehwere around kernel 2.5.8 or something, got the
answer this was a know bug that was about to be fixed, but so far, no
improvement.
If it does matter: I got an Intel LX-chipset based SMP system.
