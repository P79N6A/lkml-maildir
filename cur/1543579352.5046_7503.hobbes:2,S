	If your application has scheduling requirements, you need to communicate
them to the scheduler.

	This program doesn't demonstrate anything except that Linux's sleep time is
granular. This shouldn't be news to anyone. If you don't force a reschedule,
everything works the way it's supposed to:
main()
{
 int i, j, pipes[2];
 struct timeval tv;
 fd_set rd;
 pipe(pipes);
 write(pipes[1], "foo", 4);
 for(i=0; i<1000; i++)
 {
  FD_ZERO(&rd);
  FD_SET(pipes[0], &rd);
  tv.tv_sec=0;
  tv.tv_usec=1000;
  j=select(10, &rd, NULL, NULL, &tv);
  if(j!=1) printf("oops\n");
 }
}
