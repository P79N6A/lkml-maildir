Have you considered 
http://distcc.samba.org/
 ??
I use it to compile my (almost stock) kernels and it scales perfectly (5 boxen now).
I have a dirty shell script to:
	ssh host13.mydomain.org "cat /proc/config.gz" |gunzip >//var/tmp/kernels/linux-2.6.8-KK1_host13/.config
	cd linux-2.6.8-KK1 && make old_config && make menuconfig && make
	put the output in /var/tmp/kernels/linux-2.6.8-KK1_host13 (KBOULD_OUT),
	rsync with the host (/usr/src/linux-2.6.8-KK1 and /var/tmp/kernels/linux-2.6.8-KK1_host13),
	ssh ot host13 and "cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.8-KK1; make modules_install",
	cp kernel to /boot, change /boot/bzImage to point to it
Using distcc as I said, I compile for about ten hosts this way keeping the same tree, but with different config.
Kalin.
	
P.S. If anybody is interested in the exact script,  contact me by e-mail. Too dirty code to be presented here :-)
