Another data point: if I remove kmod, I have ...init not found, please
use init= option. Tried single, init=/bin/bash, no-go. It seems like it 
is mounting the wrong root partition (but I cannot say). My
/etc/lilo.conf doesn't have typo :) and for safe22pre (that's
2.2.0-final) it worked:
boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=200
image=/boot/bzImage
        label=linux22
        root=/dev/hda5
        read-only
        vga=771
        append="hdc=noautotune"
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.0.36-0.7
        label=linux20
        root=/dev/hda5
        read-only
other=/dev/hda1
        label=win
        table=/dev/hda
image=/boot/bzImage.save
        label=safe22pre
        root=/dev/hda5
        read-only
        vga=771
