that was it.... the MD5 sum was something like 2.... so i reinstalled binutils 
and it worked.... but now i got problems (like everytime) with the modules.
I get many messages:
modprobe: modprobe: Can't open dependencies file /lib/
modules/2.4.21-99-default/modules.dep (no such file or dir.)
i did make modules_install. Where's my fault ?
thanks very much for the help....
