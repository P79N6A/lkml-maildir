this is a mistake some other OSs did in the early SMP stage, _too_
finegrained locking increases the size of kernel objects, increases cache
footprint, sometimes increases the number of lock operations and thus
slows things down.

Not necesserily, sometimes we need more locks, sometimes we need less. The
point is to have Linux perform better. Putting a spinlock into every
'struct page' wastes some memory (128k RAM on a 128M box, not much, but
not small either), so this issue is not as easy to judge as you appear to
think. Eg. i have threaded the SysV IPC code recently, and actually ended
up _removing_ one particular type of spinlock because it only decreased
measured performance.

you might not be worried but others are ... Manfred has asked good
questions: is the particular lock you have 'expanded' into per-object
locks contended in tests, have you measured things. OS development is
never 'mathematically clean'.
