Perhaps it depends on if the node has enough memory free or not?
I assume if the zonelist has some issue but the first entry is ok
it will only cause problems when the allocation has to go off node
(it shouldn't actually go off node with that policy of course,
but with a full free local node that code path is never triggered)
