As it should be until the parport_pc cleanup routine returns.  You need
to find out why the cleanup routine is not existing correctly.  It is
almost certainly a parport problem.

Listed but marked as deleted.  The kernel module code allows the name
to be listed but attempts to get more details like symbols will return
ENOENT.  There is no error code for "it is there but it is not in a
usable state", ENOENT is as close as we get.

That is a bug in lsmod, fixed in the next modutils.  It should always
report (deleted).

Probably because cron was also running rmmod -a.  I expect one hung
rmmod when a module is in deleted status.
