how about 
	fzero(int fd, off_t off, size_t len)
which zeros the blocks and if it can creates a holey file?
However, that's not what Bob wants, he wants to remove commercials from
recorded TV.  So what he wants is 
	fdelete(int fd, off_t off, size_t len)
which has the semantics of shifting the rest of the file backwards to "off".
The main problem with this is if the off/len are not block aligned.  If they
are, then this is just block twiddling, if they aren't, then this is a file
rewrite anyway.
