Also, what aspects of it do you consider ugly? -I didn't see any better way of 
implementing this feature. No, I don't like the fact that I am mangling the 
command_line and saved_command_line arrays directly, but I wanted to reuse as 
many constructs of the kernel as possible - and that means doing just that. 
The only other aspect I see that isn't real nice is the re-setting of the 
quotation mark, which was replaced with a \0 by the parse_args function - 
this requires access to a negative array index... Also note that I placed 
special emphasis on not providing opportunity for buffer overflows or other 
boundary issues.
Please elaborate on your thoughts, if there is a better way of implementing 
this, I'll surely adapt my work.

ps: in case you're referring to the feature itself, what would be a more 
sensible way of passing sensitive data to the kernel? -I didn't see any other 
way.
