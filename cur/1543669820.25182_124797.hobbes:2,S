Not only changes to the stack pointer, but also changes to call-saved
registers, such as %ebp.  You're intending to be able to unwind through
asynchronous signals here, which means that you can't leave even a single
insn window with a register modified but not recorded.
So you also need a
	0x85 0x04			DW_CFA_offset %ebp -16
there at the end of the prologue.

And of course you need a corresponding bit here, since once we
pop off the slot in which we stored %ebp, we can't restore it
from there, because we will have clobbered that slot in the
signal handler.
(Btw, typo here in comment; it's "%ebp" not "%edx".)
So here we also need a 
	0xc5				DW_CFA_restore %ebp
here before the next DW_CFA_advance_loc.
Oh, and you don't need to use DW_CFA_advance_loc4.  You should
be using
	DW_CFA_advance_loc+N		N <= 0x3f
	DW_CFA_advance_loc1 N		N <= 0xff
We have to use DW_CFA_advance_loc4 in GCC because we don't know
the true sizes of instructions.  This gets fixed for us in GAS
through some truely disgusting magic based on section names.
