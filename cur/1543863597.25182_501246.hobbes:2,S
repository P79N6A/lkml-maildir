All my patch does is to remove "#ifndef __KERNEL__"'s around userspace 
#define's from the userspace headers, so it's purely cosmetical.
Except when userspace wrongly defines __KERNEL__, no 
header-y<->unifdef-y should ever have any non-cosmetical effect.
That said, we really want what I called "cosmetical" - not having
"#if{,n}def __KERNEL__" in any userspace headers - it's simply that this 
is not a serious bug.
