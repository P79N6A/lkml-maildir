The i386 EDD "driver" could probably be shared with x86-64, I hadn't thought
about it before.  Likewise the IA64 efivars driver *may* eventually be
shared with x86 or others if Intel's plans come to fruition.  So I'd vote
for something in drivers/ rather than arch/ for such shareable modules.  I'm
open to moving each of these if told where the "right" place should be.
Neither are char or block drivers, so those don't make sense - purely
driverfs/proc interfaces.  Nor are they "bus" drivers ala ide or scsi.
drivers/misc is empty and I think people want to keep it that way...
Some ideas for these:
drivers/i386
drivers/efi
Thoughts?
Thanks,
Matt
