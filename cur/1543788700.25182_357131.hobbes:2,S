Vanilla is just what people call it. You might call your car Betty, that
doesn't mean it's made by the Betty Corporation nor that the model is
Betty. It's simply what people call it.
Just like in Texas Hold'Em, if you get two aces before the flop people
call them "American Airlines" (AA), that doesn't make it the official
name.
So yes, linux-2.6.8.tar.gz is vanilla. linux-2.6.8-mm1.tar.gz isn't
vanilla.
Vanilla simply means "standard" or "unpatched" or "Linus Edition".
