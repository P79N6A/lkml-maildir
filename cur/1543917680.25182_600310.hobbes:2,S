Subject: 2.6.23-rc8 - Hangcheck on resume from x2mem

I find this in dmesg after resume from s2mem:
    Hangcheck: hangcheck value past margin!
System: ASUS P5LD2-VM board, Intel 6600 CPU at 2.40 GHz (no o/c) 2GB 
RAM, 3x320GB SATA sw RAID-5. FC6 distribution, fully updated, suspend 
via "system" menu pulldown.
Just in case this is of interest, the resume and suspend work without 
suspend2 patching, although since it's a server and has mains power it's 
only of interest for testing.
USB backup devices were *not* connected.
