Hmm.
I agree with you; it does sound like the process of eating memory is  
grabbing all the swap. I can't see how it could be doing that, however. If  
you really want to use Pavel's version, I'd suggest adding some more debug  
statements. Perhaps print out the number of swap pages free at the start  
of that loop.
Regards,
Nigel
