Yes you did .... most recently in

Although maybe you meant me to parse that differently ... as in,
not "why is procfs doing this broken thing?" but rather "how is it
that procfs fault (non)handling code ended up getting used?".
That's always seemed self-evident:  the RTC framework was creating
it for /dev/rtc0 (presumably, rtc-cmos), while at the same time the
legacy drivers/char/rtc.c was creating it for /dev/rtc.
Workaround by configuring just one, and the problem goes away.
(Although it *ought* to be OK to configure both, with all the normal
resource exclusions kicking in to ensure only one will run.)

It's not a wrong thing, at any rate.  This is a fairly basic task
in any filesystem:  mutual exclusion.  Code is allowed to rely on
filesystems acting correctly...

Not really; procfs is supposed to not create it if it's already there!!
Reasonable callers will cope with "it didn't get created", and that's
all they should really need to do.

What do you mean by too late "now" ... just-before-2.6.23?
I'm a bit puzzled why this issue cropped up suddenly, when the
"two RTC drivers" configs have been behaving fine (presumably
failing properly, but at least not generating problem reports)
for some time.  One of the procfs changes must have caused this
trouble.
And what would an example be of buggy-but-works code, which would
then be broken if the procfs stopped being buggy?

At a micro level, both the relevant call sites already have code
to tolerate the "couldn't create that file" error, which looked
correct at a quick reading.
