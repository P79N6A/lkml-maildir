I agree with the criticism of the private interfaces, but unstable makes
sense in the new kernel development model world -- "testing" is "we're
pretty sure that this is done but it might not be and we might change it
in the future, so pay attention" while "unstable" is more of a "we think
the design is neat, but somebody is bound to find some way we've screwed
it up and it'll probably be changed in the future to fix it, so expect
your programs to break".
