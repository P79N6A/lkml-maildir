Just to avoid potential misunderstanding...  This testing in no way
changes my opinion that the RCU Classic implementation needs some
combination of documentation and rework.  It pretty clearly needs a
bit of both.  And the increase in core counts over the past few years
indicates that some scalability work is in order.
What this testing does demonstrate is that we are not in an emergency
situation.
