I also thought this 8). But rereading it week ago, I found that
it requires to advertise as MSS maximal value, which it can accept.
And minimal allowed maximum is 576.
Yes. We are buggy here and draft-ietf-tcpimpl-pmtud-03
explicitly announces us buggy 8)
Apparently, they forgot about ax.25.

I believe. But do not understand. Seems, AX.25 is reliable protocol, is not it?
Then fragments are delivered reliably and you can only win of the fact,
that frames traversing internet are of 576 bytes.
And in backward direction nobody prohibited you to send as small frames
as possible. No, I do not understand.
