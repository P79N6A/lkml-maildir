Normally the offset of the CMOS RAM is left an an unused
offset so that the bus-crash that occurs at power-down
doesn't corrupt the CMOS register contents. After CMOS
access, the offset should be left at either 0 (the seconds-
tick) or at 0x7f. In the case of 0x00, the seconds can
get corrupted at shutdown (it still ticks, but it could
glitch to a maximum of 59 seconds off). In the case
of 0x7f, there shouldn't be anything there. Higher offsets
could alias with some board decodes.
Offset 0x0f is really bad because it stores the reason
for a shutdown.
One should never use the write-offset-address/read-value
sequence of the CMOS as some kind of timer. You don't
even know the bus that accesses it! I could be inside
a super-I/O chip (fast) or external on the "local" bus
running at 18 MHz (slow), you just don't know and you
would need to use the "rtc_lock" spin-lock so that somebody
doesn't access the chip between the time you set the
offset and read or write the result.
