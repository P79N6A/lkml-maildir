I presume you mean the patch at
 	
http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=120818415110509&w=2
?
If so, I think there's something not quite right with your timer 
cancellation -- as far as I can tell (the workqueue code seems to have 
been under quite a bit of flux, and the comments are sparse) we should be 
using cancel_delayed_work_sync() -- this appears to be the correct routine 
for cancelling a self retriggering workqueue timer.
If this change is made (and the corresponding simplifications made -- for 
example, it also appears to be defined that container_of can be used 
directly on the work_struct*, since delayed_work is defined to place the 
work_struct at the start -- then your patch becomes effectively identical 
to my patch below.
