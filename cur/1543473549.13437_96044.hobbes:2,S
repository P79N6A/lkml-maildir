The SMP ones its obvious why they are needed. For 2.3.x this can be sorted with
linker and segment tricks properly.

The more different they get the more they need to be fixed to be one kernel
tree. As it stands now the 2.1.x tree with the right instruciton options 
except for tsc for builds doesnt boot on the earlier cyrix chips, the amd k5,
and the cyrix mediagx. 
In my tree the timer interrupt is still a jump vector, I can't measure any
performnace difference between that and the older system. It also needs to
know about chips with a tsc that has 'issues'.
The Alpha has been through this pain to the point that people gave up on
the Linux instructions and installed NT simply because they couldn't work out
which kernel to install. We now have a generic kernel for the Alpha, thanks
to deep magic we have a generic kernel for the Sparc - which makes the intel
like look positively sane
The x86 shouldnt make the same mistakes as the Alpha did.
We only have a few differences to address in the near time scale, excepting
the 386.
	FPU 	<->   no FPU
	RDTSC	<->   mb timer
	FXSAVE  <->   FSAVE
FXSAVE is figured, RDTSC _was_ sorted, FPU has long been sorted.
