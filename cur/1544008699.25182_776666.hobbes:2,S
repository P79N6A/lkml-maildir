A consistent approach to the Kconfig hints would help. To me,
"If unsure, say N" implies that turning off the feature won't break
the kernel nor be anything particularly important. The Kconfig hints
should follow the defaults (or else why default to 'y'?) for common
architectures.
Perhaps menuconfig can generate the "If unsure" message itself from
the architecture defaults? That will ensure consistency.
