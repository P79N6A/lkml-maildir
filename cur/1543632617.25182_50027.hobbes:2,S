That driver is solid for SMP.  It's possible that the BP6
is losing its IRQ routing assignments, or the APIC is
getting stuck.  We had extensive problems with that last
year.  A workaround was implemented and as far as I can tell,
the problem went away.
It seems to affect network cards most because they typically
generate the most interrupts.
Try booting the machine with the `noapic' option.
