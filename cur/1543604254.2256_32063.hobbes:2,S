It doesn't already.  I am not sure this is a kernel thing
either.  Changing swap priorities could be done by userspace
programs if there were a syscall or /proc interface
for it.  
You could then have a script changing priorities when you start your
database for example.  Or a daemon making changes based on 
statistics.
