Looks good ;-)
One small thing -- since you appear to test all cases for (lp->mii) 
before calling mod_timer, I don't think you need to test lp->mii inside 
the timer...
As Felipe mentioned, using the link interrupt instead of a timer is 
preferred -- but my own preference would be to apply your patch with the 
small remove-lp->mii-check fixup, and then investigate the support of 
link interrupts.  The reasoning is that, pcnet32 covers a ton of chips, 
and not all may support a link interrupt.
