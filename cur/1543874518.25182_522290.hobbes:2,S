and by the way, you can try to use void split_page(struct page *page,
unsigned int order) function, but keep in mind, that it's not
recommended to use it in drivers:
/*
 * split_page takes a non-compound higher-order page, and splits it into
 * n (1<<order) sub-pages: page[0..n]
 * Each sub-page must be freed individually.
 *
 * Note: this is probably too low level an operation for use in drivers.
 * Please consult with lkml before using this in your driver.
 */
void split_page(struct page *page, unsigned int order)
Good luck.
Dan.
