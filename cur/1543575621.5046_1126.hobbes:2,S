Last time you asked the similar question, my answer to you bounced.
This debug output was submitted by Dragan Stancevic <visitor@valinux.com>.
The current timeout values are high enough to try to increase them more.
The question I'm interested in is how command 0x80 appeared in the command
register...
To answer your question in short, yet, we hope to fix the problem sooner or
later.
