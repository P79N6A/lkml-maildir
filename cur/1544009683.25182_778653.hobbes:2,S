Okay, thanks for this.
Though, to be honest, we're not all that keen on random cleanups of
this kind: they can cause more trouble than they're worth, when real
development is going on in the area - better leave them to those who
are working on bigger changes nearby.
But mm/mmap.c is currently the same in mmotm as in Linus's git
(though slightly different from the 2.6.27 version in your patch -
I've rediffed it below), so it shouldn't cause anyone much trouble:
Andrew, please add to mmotm.  (scripts/checkpatch.pl does warn on
the long acct_stack_growth line, but Zhenwen has made it a little
shorter, and people disagree about long function declaration lines.)
Please inline your patches in future, so all can see them at a glance:
ah, you're using gmail, yes, that does mess them up - I believe there's
advice on how to configure it for sending Linux patches somewhere in
the archives, but I didn't find it in Documentation/SubmittingPatches
just now, sorry.
Hugh
