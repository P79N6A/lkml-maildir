FYI to all interested in playing with Fibre Channel:
The FC HBA driver put out by Qlogic works well but does a silly thing; it 
enumerates devices from 0, instead of by the actually loop ID. This makes 
it impossible to spec absolute paths to the device, as everything will
shift when devices are moved on the FC loop.
This one liner patch to qla2x00.c fixes this problem, by enumerating
by loop id.
