That's wrong. When you run 'make headers_install', the result is placed
in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/abi/include/ 
It looks like glibc is pointed at the raw kernel headers in the build
tree.

Don't care. <linux/err.h> is not a header which is exported to userspace
by 'make headers_install'. No userspace build, including glibc, should
ever be able to see it.
