Just hit it with xmms:
$ less /proc/1284/wchan
sys_rt_sigsuspend
$ less /proc/1285/wchan
schedule_timeout
$ less /proc/1286/wchan
schedule_timeout
$ less /proc/16656/wchan
do_clock_nanosleep
$ less /proc/16657/wchan
do_clock_nanosleep
kill -STOP `pidof xmms` ; kill -CONT `pidof xmms` gets it unstuck so
it's not lethal, but still...
