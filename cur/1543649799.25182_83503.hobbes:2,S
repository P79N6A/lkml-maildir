Did you see any place where this is called with lock(s) hold? Maybe
there is, but I could not see here.  They are called from the functions
which are used by IPC code only. Inside IPC there is only spin_lock per
ID and sem_undo lock. Both of them are not hold when ipc_rcu_free is
called.

Good point. I agree GFP_ATOMIC fits better here.

Are you saying that have a static RCU header structure in the
object-to-be-freed?  I think it's possible.  It fits well in the rmid
case, where the object to be freed is an kern_ipc_perm structure. But
for the  grow_ary() case, the object to be freed is a array of struct
ipc_id, so it need a little bit more changes there. Maybe add a new
structure ipc_entries, which include the RCU header structure and the
pointer to the entries array.  Then have the ipc_ids->entries point to
ipc_entries.  Just a little concern that this way we added a reference
when looking up the IPC ID from the array.
