It seem somewhere between 2.2.17 and the current 2.2.18 kernel, IP 
kernel level autoconfiguration has been broken.  Upon kernel loading 
the Ethernet card is detected and loaded properly, but the bootp code 
never seems to be executed and mounting the root partion via NFS  then 
fails from lack of IP configuration.
I haven't had any luck tracing down the root of this problem.  
Anyone else experience this problem or have a patch to fix it?
