	Have you ever run modem pool with dozens of discret modems
on analog telephone lines with awful quality ? I do. And I every
day oblige to use kill -9 xxxx as last method to kill hanged pppd
process. And now with 2.2 kernel I oblige to seek ppp interface
and than do ifconfig pppXX down since in 2.2 it does not close
automaticaly, what my patch fixed.

	But if pppd fails undepend on reason ppp interface must be closed.
And this kernel job isn't it ?

	Do you suppouse that if this bug fixed in 2.3 kernel its good reason
to not fix in 2.2 kernel ? And apart from ppp there is also slip driver with
the same problems. And for slip both problems still have place in 2.3 kernel 
too.

	All what I've made in this patch that all from practical needings
of big ISP with dozens of servers all running Linux. And even don't pay
attention to my needings - what do you think more correct: have in system
useless command that do only half of job and ask people "Why would you do that ?"
or make this command complete and useful ?

	I think you are right here. I make this calls in patch for 2.3 kernel,
but I forget about it in 2.2. Here is corrected patch:
