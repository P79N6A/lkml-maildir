Eliminating prototypes saves me from an extra go round of the edit-compile
testcycle when I change the signature of a function.  It probably doesn't
matter to you, but it adds a small amount of annoyance to my day.

I tried to place functions close together that seemed like they were
called together and called from each other.   It's hard to know,
of course, because GCC will make its own decisions about inlining,
for example.  At the end of the day, this is an NP problem.  I remmber
Nat writing grope and using simulated annealing to solve the problem.

We don't, but the new layout is more likely to be good than bad, given
how I did the rearrangement (delete prototypes, try to compile.  Move
called function to before its first caller.  Repeat).  Plus, with all
the other changes I'm making, there's a serious reduction in driver
size.  I haven't compared i-cache sizes specifically, but I'm mostly
removing code, so it should be better.
