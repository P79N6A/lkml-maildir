I made a fix to the locking code in main drm a couple of months ago.
The X server tries to get the DRM_QUIESCENT lock, but when the wait was
interrupted by a signal (like when you move a window around), the locking
function returned without error. This made the X server release other
clients' locks.
This does affect all drivers with a quiescent() function. Not only via.
But it looks like this fix never made it into the kernel source?
