Yes, removal is not premature; long overdue if anything.  At the risk
of overlapping Andries' job as official historian, I found this in my
archive of cruft.  So it was almost 1996  :)

I'd prefer it even more if you'd just start "bdflush" instead. 
I know that user-level isn't running yet, but it should be reasonably
trivial to do
	kernel_thread(sys_bdflush, NULL);
and off you go..  Could you try this instead? I'd be happer (this is how
bdflush should have been started in the first place, but back when
bdflush was done there were no easy access to kernel threads..)
(oh, btw, in the meantime I applied this set of patches, because they
are better than it used to be.  But I'd be grateful for a new set on top
of this that does the above, hint, hint).
