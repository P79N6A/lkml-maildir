Good job tracking this down.  I saw someone get bit by probably this
same bug a few days ago.  Whilst on the subject though, can we do
something about the printk ?
It always bothered me that some drivers print something when
a) built-in, and b) they don't find something.
For kitchen sink kernels, this makes for a really noisy bootup.
So you didn't find hardware I know I don't have. Big deal, move on.
dmesg spam these days is getting really out of hand.
hmm, maybe a mod_printk, to only printk something when built as
a module ?
