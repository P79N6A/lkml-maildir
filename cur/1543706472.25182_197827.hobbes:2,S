Sure.  Completely random device numbers will make this demand loading of 
device drivers impossible. Either it won't happen (all numbers won't be 
completely random, although they may get more dynamic than today) or
module loading based on device node opening will be deprecated.
This won't mean the end of dynamic loading, you will merely need to
load modules explicit before you get a device node.

Still possible. Boot script (possibly the udev startup script)
copies a handful of device nodes from the RO root into the tmpfs /dev.
