Yeah, I think I noted that .ko was a good idea, just to prevent confusion.
However, the original post I made was sort of a subtle hint, let me stop
beating around the bush: how about adding mkinitrd to the other module
stuff before 0.9.9 is really released, using the same .old technique used
for insmod et al? It would allow people doing testing of both 2.4 and 2.5
kernels to stop fighting build issues.
