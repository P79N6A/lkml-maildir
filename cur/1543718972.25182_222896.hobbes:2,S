I seem to always repress that part.

Ok. Still, that doesn't sound too bad. I assume that the pte write has to 
be atomic anyway (ie it doesn't walk the page tables, but it clearly _has_ 
to do an atomic "read-modify-update" or just the _hardware_ updates might 
race against each other and one CPU loses the dirty bit when another CPU 
writes back the accessed bit).
So I really think it should be safe to just do a regular write when you 
update both bits, because you know that no other CPU will at least _clear_ 
any bits. Hmm?
So it sounds like the SWAP loop basically ends up being just something 
like
	val = pte_value(entry);
	for (;;) {
		oldval = SWAP(ptep, val);
		/*
		 * If we wrote a value that had the same or more bits set 
		 * than the old value, we're ok...
		 */
		if (!(oldval & ~val))
			break;
		/*
		 * ..otherwise we need to write the "or" of all bits and
		 * try again.
		 */
		val |= oldval;
	}
Right? Note that the reason we can do the "dirty and accessed bit both 
set" case with a simple write is exactly because that's already the 
"maximal" bits anybody can write to the thing, so we don't need to loop, 
we can just write it directly.
I realize that this isn't as simple as the x86 solution (or most
everything else, for that matter ;), but it's by no means totally
unreasonable. Or are there even _more_ gotchas that I've missed?
