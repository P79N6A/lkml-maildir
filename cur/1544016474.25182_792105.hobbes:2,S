The problem is that dropping the spinlock right before schedule is a voluntary
preemption point and can cause a schedule, right after which we schedule again.
Fix this inefficiency by keeping preemption disabled until we schedule, do this
by explicitly disabling preemption and providing a schedule() variant that
assumes preemption is already disabled.

Good point, seeing any way around that?

TBH I've no clue, probably not, Ingo?
