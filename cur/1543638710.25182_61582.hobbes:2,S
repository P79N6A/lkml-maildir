   I suspect that there is some non-zero order-X (probably 2 or 3), where you 
   just win more than you lose. Even for small programs. 
Furthermore it would obviously help to enhance the clear_user_page()
interface to handle multiple pages because that would nullify the
startup/finish overhead of the copy loop.  (read as: things like TLB
loads and FPU save/restore on some platforms)
