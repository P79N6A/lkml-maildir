That appears to be a contested viewpoint. The current voting is 8
people in favour of kassert always evaluating its arguments and 6 in
favour of it not doing so if its disabled - and, as previously stated,
I'm in the latter group.

That has the problem that it doesn't print the condition if its
enabled. The following would be better:
 Q> #if (!cond) {
 Q>	kassert(cond);
 Q>	goto DealWithError;
 Q> }
Replace the goto with a return if no special handling is required,
otherwise DealWithError deallocates any memory leaks or the like that
would be left behind.

One problem is that I don't see a kdebug.h file in the 2.2.10 tree,
other than the SPARC specific ones in asm-sparc{,64}/kdebug.h and, as
a result, your comments are less than helpful.
Best wishes from Riley.
