Sure.  
On a ppc64 logically partitioned system, there can be a setup where
function 0 of a PCI-PCI bridge is assigned to one partition and
(for example) function 2 is assigned to a second partition.  On the
second partition, it would appear that function 0 does not exist, but
function 2 does.  If all the functions are not scanned, everything under
function 2 would not be detected.
This patch allows devices that don't respond to function 0, but do
respond to other functions to be marked with a quirk and have all of
their functions scanned.  
Thanks,
Jake
