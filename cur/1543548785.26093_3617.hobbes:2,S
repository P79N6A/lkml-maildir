I really want a module... At least while I'm writing the code. I don't want to
have to reboot every time I make a change.

It doesn't make all that much difference in call latency to be in a module
rather than in the kernel. Plus you can load it when you need it, and so it's
not permanently eating a chunk of non-swappable memory.
Additionally, I'm not sure that Linus would put it in the kernel.
