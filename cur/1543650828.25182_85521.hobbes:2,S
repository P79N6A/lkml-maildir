Both the lkcd and ide mini-oopser have that (although the mini-oopser
has only x86-ide for now).
The mini-oopser has different aims than LCKD: they want to debug one
system, I want to make sure we're reaping OOPS reports from those 99%
of desktop users who run X and simply reboot when their machine
crashes once a month.
I did *not* put the mini-oopser on the Snowball list, because I don't
have time to polish it.
Rusty.
