Hi all,
I'm sorry if this is off-topic, but I wasn't sure where else to ask...
My kernel is running from RAM, and I want to jump to an address in ROM
(which unfortunately, the kernel doesn't seem to know anything about).  I
don't plan on trying to resume the kernel after doing this.  However, I'm
getting a prefetch abort.  If I try and load the data, I get a similar
error: "Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 00003000"
where 0x3000 is the ROM address I'm trying to jump to / load from.  How can
I pass execution to this address?  Do I have to turn off the MMU?  FYI, I'm
running a 2.2 variant on an XScale, and used inline assembly to generate the
load & the branch.
Thanks for your help,
-ian
