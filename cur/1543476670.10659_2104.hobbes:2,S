Hi,
I was stress testing the NFS client against userland NFS server across
localhost.
I don't think NFS over TCP is supposed to work too well yet, but I tried
it anyway. In case anyone is interested I did
mount -t nfs -o nolock,rsize=16384,wsize=16384,intr,tcp localhost:/usr/src
/mnt
Then to stress test, "cd /usr/src/linux; make -j zImage"
Things didn't go too well, I got all variety of dangerous sounding
messages. Here is a sample.
Jan 10 22:14:47 localhost kernel: RPC:      empty TCP record.
Jan 10 22:14:47 localhost kernel: rpciod: active tasks at shutdown?!
Jan 10 22:14:47 localhost kernel: nfs_revalidate_inode: drivers/pci
^^^^^ lots of getattr() failed, error always seems to be -5
I also got a RPC: wot no daemon? and some other messages but at this stage
I had killed the loggers (along with everything else!)
Once I got the system to stop thrashing and killed everything, all
getattr() calls to the still mounted filesystem failed despite an idle
system and plenty of memory.
I can happily repeat the exercise if anyone wants.
Note that TCP NFS seemed to work pretty well for less loaded conditions
(and with rsize=wsize=8192).
Cheers
Chris
P.S. After all my NFS expermiments about 6Mb memory repeatably goes
"missing" - any ideas?
