Crazy idea - did you let it finish booting or you hit suspend as soon
as you could? It looks like kseriod was busy discovering your
touchpad/trackpoint for the first time...
Anyway, Pavel, I think 6 seconds it too short of a timeout for
stopping all tasks. PS/2 is pretty slow, trackpad reset can take up to
2 seconds alone...
Bjorn, does it help if you change TIMEOUT in kernel/power/process.c to 30 * HZ?
