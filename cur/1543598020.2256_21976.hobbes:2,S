The basic idea is a good one (I have written a similar thing in the past ;)
Your implementation is O(n^2) however in ps, which is not acceptable.
Much better is it to add a new field to mm_struct that gets initialised
on first creation with the pid, and adding a place holder in pid hash
if that process goes away and the mm_struct is still there to avoid pid
reuse (or alternatively link task_structs to mms and always use the pid of
the first entry)
