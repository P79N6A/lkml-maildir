No it is not. The PCMCIA adapter does not generate a hot plug event when
the card is changed. This proposal is still wrong. Please either fix
your user space so it works (like the GNOME one does out of the box) or
propose a sensible kernel change to suppress the hotplug events such as
serial number checking. The latter sounds sensible to me because it
would cleanup somewhat.
Simply posting new variants of the wrong patch repeating false claims is
not a way to fix bugs.
