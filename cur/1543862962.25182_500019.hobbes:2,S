Now that's a really good idea, and simple to do too.
For some time I've been thinking of a sysfs entry that could list for
you all the drivers in the tree. Perhaps that, combined with your idea
(as well as implementing your idea separately) would be helpful?

Yes, we really need to get around to checking what drivers do suspend
and resume properly for both S3 and S4, and prodding the authors where
necessary.
