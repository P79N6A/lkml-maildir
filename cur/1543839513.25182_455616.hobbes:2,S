It turns out you were right, while I can mount the dvd quite normally:
# mount /dev/dvd -t udf /mnt/dvd
Device /dev/dvd is write-protected, mounting read-only.
UDF-fs INFO UDF 0.9.8.1 (2004/29/09) Mounting volume 'SOLIDARNOSC', timestamp 2036/02/07 03:58 (1078)
but any attempt to copy the file results in such kernel message.
