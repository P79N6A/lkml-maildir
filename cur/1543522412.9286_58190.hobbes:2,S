Not true, ato is a u32 and I just double checked that the computation
is kept unsigned by the compiler on both sparc64 and ix86.

This is intentional, the goal of the code is to make sure bit
31 is clear.  It might be set, it might not, we don't know
at the time the code is run.

Not true on all RISC machines I am familiar with.  It's 2 instructions
either way.  On x86 you'll end up using a larger opcode and one of
x86's most notable performance advantages is it's code density.
   and `&= (1U<<31)' is more obvious.  Using a symbolic constant would be even
   better.
You mean '&= ~(1UL<<31)'
