Oh, there is no hurry with this. In fact, I'd rather take it slow than try 
to make any big changes to something that _largely_ works but has problems 
in some special cases.
In fact, I'd be happiest if the first step would be to just rename the
interface and change the argument infrastructure, but actually keep all
the behaviour "obviously the same". Bugs and all, if it comes to that. So
I'd rather take several small steps (and let people use it for a while in
between) than try to do everything. And yes, 2.6.3 is not even a target.
