Seems like I'm having some egg on my face here. Argh !
According to 
http://developer.intel.com/design/chipsets/mobile/830.htm
 :
830MP : supports external AGP2X/4X graphics
830M  : includes Intel's next generation performance oriented integrated 
graphics controller, featuring Intel® Graphics Technology, as well as 
external AGP2X/4X graphics support
830MG : supports value oriented integrated graphics for value priced 
notebook segments
To sum up : this is an IBM A30p, with an "external" Radeon Mobility LY 
(32 MB), and an 830MP instead of an 830M. The 830MP is common for both 
IBM A30 and A30p models.
Sorry about wasting your time this way : I should get my facts straight 
in the first place. I did have oopses, though.  ;)
No mention of the 830MP in the kernel sources ; patches are welcome.  :)
