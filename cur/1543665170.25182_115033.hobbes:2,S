We are talking about HT, don't we ? Cores share execution units and memory
requests are shot on the memory I/O units of the CPU. Before there is a
cache circuitry intervention. Something like "while (!run);" will generate
an enormous amount of memory I/O requests on the CPU's memory units. That
are shared by cores. Even with non-HT CPU, the above loop creates problems
respect of the latency to exit the loop itself when the condition will
become true. This because of the huge number of alloc request issued, that
must be, exiting the loop, 1) discarded 2) checked against reordering. But
I don't think the exit latency matters a lot here.
