Would there be a problem if the init for acpiphp ran
before the init for dock started?
(no, I don't think that use of acpi_walk_namespace
 would/could have any effect on the order)
I don't know if we have tight controls on module load order.
IIR it depends on the link order in the makefiles for
static modules, and the init scripts for loadable modules.
