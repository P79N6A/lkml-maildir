This is an incorrect analysis. OpenGL has the ability to "yield" after
every frame specifically for SGI IRIX (React/Pro) frame scheduler (driven
by the system vertical retrace interrupt) so that it can free up CPU
resources for other tasks to run. The problem here is that the yield
behavior is treated generally instead of specifically to a particular
proportion scheduler policy.
The correct solution is for the app to use a directed yield and a policy
that can directly support it so that OpenGL can guaratee a frame rate
governed by CPU bandwidth allocated by the scheduler.
Will is working on such a mechanism now.
