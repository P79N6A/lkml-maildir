I should be able to.
For both patches:
Acked-by: H. Peter Anvin <hpa@zytor.com>
[Let me know if you prefer me setting up a git tree to pull from.]
This was introduced by commit
1ed8a2b3c501bedd4b35130c8a52662ccf78abad, which among other things have
this:
--------
As Behdad pointed out, some fonts (e.g. sun12x22 from the kbd package)
lack Unicode mapping information, hence all you get is lots of question
marks. Though theoretically it's actually a user-space bug (the font
should be fixed), Behdad and I both believe that it'd be good to work
around in the kernel by re-introducing the fallback solution for ASCII
characters only. This sounds a quite reasonable decision, since all
fonts ship the ASCII characters in the first 128 positions. This way
users won't be surprised by lots of question marks just because s/he
issued a not-so-perfectly parameterized setfont command. As this
fallback is only re-introduced for code points below 128, you still
won't see an accented letter replaced by another, but at least you'll
always get the English letters right.
--------
The implementation was obviously buggy, however.
The statement above is also just plain wrong, since installing a font
with no Unicode table causes a direct-to-font Unicode table to be set up
(0xF0xx for all positions) unless explicitly overridden.
Anyway, I was rather against adding this fallback, because I felt it was
needless complexity to deal with a very explicit user error.
Fortunately, the bug didn't affect any legitimate users.
