Yes, you are right. But something was changed (probably) between 2.6.6 and 
2.7 because I always test new kernels with every debug enabled, just in 
case :). It was slower but never caused such problems.
No, I am currently not bk user (but I will probably learn it during 
holidays). Is there any easy way to produce patch from that changeset?
I want to test it to check if it really is the cause of the problem.
