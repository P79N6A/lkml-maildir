It needs to be double-dropped for any directory inodes.  Some of the
older code just did i_nlink-=2, and I chose to just call drop_nlink()
twice instead of making another helper to do arbitrary arithmetic on
i_nlink.
I believe this made up for the 
        if (S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode))
                inode->i_nlink = 0;
in the old code.
