Hello!
In reply to your more recent message, I had looked but not tried, so
didn't feel in a position to reply yet.

Well, that looks good, for a start :)

Given the clearing of the flag above, should we just have a
set_unfreezeable here that's used above (and potentially elsewhere)...
(reads more)... or more generic set_[un]freezeable(task_struct *p)
routines that could also be used in copy_flags below?

I'm the one who is confused, aren't I? If I'm reading this right,
io_apic used to be frozen. After this patch, it will not be frozen. If
that's the intended behaviour, shouldn't this be two patches - one to
make kernel threads unfreezeable by default, and one to make threads
that were formerly freezeable unfreezeable?

Perhaps it would be good to keep a variant of this question, along the
lines of:
Q: I have a kernel thread that needs to be frozen during hibernation.
How do I make that happen?
