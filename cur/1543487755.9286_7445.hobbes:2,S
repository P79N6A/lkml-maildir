Hello All,
I have a Linux 2.2.2 NFS server supporting a diskless NFS 2.2.1 client
I have been attempting to install hurd onto the diskless system, via
Linux, and this involves the command
huey# abc/dpkg-hurd --unpack abc/grep_2.1-8.1.deb --force-depends
Where the source directory is a disk mounted /tmp/gnu/abc, and the destination
directory is a harddisk /tmp/gnu. The cwd is /tmp/gnu. /tmp is NFS mounted.
All NFS partitions have been mounted with "nolock".
This is the response:
huey# abc/dpkg-hurd --unpack abc/grep_2.1-8.1.deb --force-depends
rm: /tmp/03631aaa/.nfs5800afcc000000eb: Device or resource busy
rm: /tmp/03631aaa: Device or resource busy
rm cleanup failed, code 256
tar: Skipping to next file header
gzip: stdin: invalid compressed data--crc error
tar: Archive - EOF not on block boundary
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
dpkg-deb: subprocess tar returned error exit status 2
While the problem is indeed that the deb file is currupt, I shouldn't
get the errors "Device or resource busy".
