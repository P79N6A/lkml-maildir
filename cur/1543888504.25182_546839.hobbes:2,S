More and more do I get the impression that with full hardware control for Linux,
from BIOS to firmware, great things could be done. Alas.

Well, if it's going to be retried later on, then it's not really a deadline, is it?
Perhaps it's better to give up after the deadline, and only try again after an
interrupt is received from the controller?

The annoying part is that all this seems to depend on the harddisk, and not
really on the controller (or the combination of the two).

Another one would be to do it interrupt driven instead of doing polling,
if the controller supports it well.

Are you saying that right now there is only one EH thread? In that case an
improvent would be to have one EH thread per controller/device, so that at
least independent scsi devices can't block each other.

Well, it seems you just moved the other direction, with leaning on sd_resume.

Hm, I suspected something like that. Though the shutdown sound of my HD
seems to sound the same as usual. Perhaps the BIOS gives it a sign as part of the
suspend? (Or to the controller, which delegates it.)

The "problem" here is that the option only shows up after the device is detected,
in which case the default is already executed, rendering the 'start' part useless
for people who don't use s2ram. So the interface does seem to be a bit hampered,
or at least not fully effective. On the other hand, as you said disks are spin up by
the BIOS already, so it's more a theoretical problem than a real one I suppose.
Thanks for your explanations,
Indan
