Sure, it's not a critical bug or anything but hey.  One more time:
This is a very minor patch for fs/nls/Config.in, which Petr Vandrovec came up
with.  The problem is that if CONFIG_INET is n, CONFIG_SMB_FS is never set
so fs/nls/Config.in assumes that the user wants to select some NLS options.
This fixes it and works on config/menuconfig/xconfig.
