The LSM module controls what is measured and should only be calling
integrity_measure() for appropriate files.  IBAC, for example, only
calls integrity_measure() for executables from bprm_check_security()
and file_mmap() and for other regular files from inode_permission(), 
based on the existence of the 'security.measure' xattr, which is 
labeled by a userspace application.  The integrity provider, here,
is just doing a quick sanity check, but I'll definitely make it 
more complete and fix the comment to make this clearer.
Thanks!
