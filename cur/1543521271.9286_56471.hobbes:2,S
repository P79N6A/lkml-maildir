Hi
I found out another interesting thing with the USB pci card: While the
onboard USB controller's operation is only affected by the harddisk DMA
mode the PCI card produces data buffer errors even when I am playing
back on my ISA soundcard (ESS1869). As soon as I stop the playback the
PCI USB controller is working fine again.
