Hmm... Well, I think we were already planning on telling our customers that we don't 
support hot-swap RAM.  Is there a CONFIG option for that feature?

It's PCI-X, actually, and I don't think we've ever actually plugged it into a PPC box. 
Isn't Open Firmware support required for all PPC boxes, anyway?  Our PCI card is not OF 
compatible, AFAIK.
As for IA64, well, we could support it, but it's not a high enough priority.  We do have 
some CPU-specific code in our driver that we would need to port to IA-64.

No, if anything, it's the competition to IB.  It's called iWARP (RDMA over TCP/IP), and 
it's similar to IB except it uses gigabit ethernet instead of whatever hardware IB uses. 
Because we also support RMDA, we have the same problems as OpenIB, however, we would 
prefer that the kernel support OpenRDMA instead, since it's more generic.

The current version of the code calls sys_mlock() directly from the driver.  We haven't 
released yet the version that calls mlock().
