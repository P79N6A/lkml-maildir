Subject: AIO patches reworked against radix-tree-writeback changes
Reply-To: suparna@in.ibm.com
I just uploaded an update to the AIO patchset against the
-mm tree (2.6.5-rc3-mm4):
www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/suparna/aio/265rc3mm4
This includes a rework of the concurrent O_SYNC speedup and 
AIO O_SYNC support code against the recent tagged radix-tree 
writeback changes in -mm, and a few associated cleanups of 
the fsaio write path. Feedback from testing of this functionality 
would be very welcome.
Also included is an aio-poll patch from Chris Mason, 
based on the retry model, and an aio-context-switch patch
again from Chris Mason that helps brings down the number
of context switches seen with pipetest to a reasonable
level.
Regards
Suparna
