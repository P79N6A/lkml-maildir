Subject: [PATCH 1/3] mull'ify multiplication with HZ in __const_udelay() [Was: Re: Too much error in __const_udelay() ?]

John Stultz mentioned on lkml ( 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/6/5/15
 ) that
calls to udelay() don't delay long enough, causing trouble e.g. in the USB
subsystem. The following patches address this issue.
Move the multiplication of (loops_per_jiffy * xloops) with HZ into
the "mull" asm operation. This increases the accuracy of the delay functions
largely:
n usec delay on a system with loops_per_jiffy = 1500000 : 
  n 	   before	  after
  1	 1000 ticks	 1499 ticks
 10	14000 ticks	14999 ticks
n usec delay on a system with loops_per_jiffy = 100000 : 
 n 	   before	  after
  1	    0 ticks	   99 ticks
 10	    0 ticks	  999 ticks
100	 9000 ticks	 9999 ticks
As noted by Kurt Garloff, it's necessary to adjust for large loops_per_jiffies,
as the multiplication of it with HZ fails for 4GHz or larger. So, John Stultz
suggested multiplying xloops with 4 first, and multiplying with (HZ/4).
