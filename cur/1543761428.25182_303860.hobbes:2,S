I hope I did a descent job and that you didn't waste too much time

The plan is to wait for a few months (or a few kernel releases - whichever 
comes first) and then I'll send Andrew patches to remove it completely.
There are still a few related nits left, like the FPU_verify_area function 
arch/i386/math-emu/reg_ld_str.c and the rw_verify_area function in 
fs/read_write.c that I want to get out of the way first (think I'll 
probably end up attempting to rename those s/verify_area/access_ok/ and 
see if people scream).
