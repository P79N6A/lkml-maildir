Don't even bother creating a project.  Just submit the patches back to 
QEMU.  There's been a lot of discussion about this functionality within 
QEMU.  There's no reason to fork QEMU yet again (Xen has given up and is 
now maintaining a patch queue).  In this case, there's no reason why you 
would even need a patch queue.
