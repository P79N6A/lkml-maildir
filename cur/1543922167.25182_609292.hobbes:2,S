Yes, those filesystems, which have a file ID that can be used to index
the inodes.  Lot of filesystems (mostly those not originating from
UNIX) don't have such an ID.

In what way does passing the open file to the filesystem for the
fstat() syscall negatively impact Linux?
Usually it is best to design midlayers, so that they do the minimal
stuff, and pass the maximum of information to the low-layer, and
providing helper functions that the low-layer doesn't want to do
anything special.  Hiding information from the low-layer is pointless.

I'm not sure what you are talking about here.  AFAICS this change
has absolutely nothing to do with filesystem (or any other kind of)
security.

No problem.  Thanks anyway for your comments.
