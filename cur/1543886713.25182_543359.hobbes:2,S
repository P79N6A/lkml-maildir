Subject: [PATCH 3/3] ALPHA: misc fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/11/201

Also from Jay:
1. arch/alpha/Kconfig
   several adjustments:
      a) additions to the systems list and cleanup of same
      b) change limits of NR_CPUS and make dep. on platform
   Note that MARVEL support is limited to 32 CPUs whan using
   42-bit KSEG - one needs 48-bit KSEG to handle up to 64, and
   we've never supported 48-bit KSEG.
2. include/asm-alpha/core_wildfire.h
   fix a typo that undoubtedly prevents WILDFIRE support
   from working
