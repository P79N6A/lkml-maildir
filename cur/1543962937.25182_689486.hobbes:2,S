> This patch adds support for flag values which are ORed to the type passwd
> to socket and socketpair.  The additional code is minimal.  Beside
> decoding the flags with the library function introduced in a prior patch
> all that has to be done is to pass the new value around.
> 
> The internal functions sock_alloc_fd and sock_map_fd get a new parameters
> and all callers are changed.
