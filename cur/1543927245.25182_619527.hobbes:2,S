    softlockup: use cpu_clock() instead of sched_clock()
    sched_clock() is not a reliable time-source, use cpu_clock() instead.
but we only have cpu_clock() from v2.6.23 onwards - so we should not 
apply the original patch to v2.6.22. (we should not have applied your 
patch that started the mess to begin with - but that's another matter.)
