Well, I think the filesystem should get the first shot at altering the
readahead heuristic (we should add a hook so it can then ask the
underlying device).
Something like:
===
Hook for filesystems to tweak readahead logic
It was suggested at Fengguang's OLS talk that filesystems can make a
useful contribution to the readahead logic: avoiding seeks and lock
boundaries (on cluster filesystems) and other such filesystem-specific
things.
The alter_readahead hook should return the number of pages to read.
