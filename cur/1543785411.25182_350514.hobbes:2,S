True - I never had a machine which parport_arc was used on, so it
existed from the time when parport was initially written and remained
in that rather sad state.  The only person I know who may have tinkered
with it would be Dave Gilbert.
However, it's now within the set of machines which Ian looks after, so
Ian should at least know of its impending demise.
