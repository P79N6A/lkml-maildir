If this "freedom" means that we become slaves to ANYBODY (including
the FSF) about ANYTHING, then it's not worth having.
As far as I can tell, your insistance on everybody using the term
"GNU/Linux" is because YOU want to enslave all of us into YOUR
organisation. I for one am NOT interested in that, so I will continue
to refer to the real name of the product, and I suggest you start
doing the same...
