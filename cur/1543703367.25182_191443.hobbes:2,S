The usual answer is to use a serial console to log the kernel messages,
but not everyone has that option available to them.
Depending on your system, you might be able to use kmsgdump to
capture the final kernel messages to a floppy disk (if you have a
"legacy" type floppy).  If you are interested in trying that,
the kmsgdump patch is available at
