No, Pavel's clock is fine AFAIK.  The message was sent in
January.  However, it was just received AGAIN today.  I don't
have a clue how it could have happened, but my guess was perhaps
vger was restored from a backup or something and the mail queue
was ancient.
Also, my duplicate filter is still nailing lots of postings from
lkml, so some looping must still be happening as I'm only sub'd
under this address.
