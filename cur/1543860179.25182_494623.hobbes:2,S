I see the fine grained security of Selinux as a big problem for third 
party applications.
It's a big job to make the OS work cleanly with it but the fact is that 
many machines need to run significant 3rd party applications. I don't have 
first hand experience but I suspect most vendors have tight enough budgets 
without adding an Selinux developer and customers usually don't have this 
resource either so, by and large, I expect people will just have to 
disable it.
I really don't see any solution to this problem either.
Time will tell.
