Manik Raina has invited you to open a free Gmail account. The invitation 
will expire in three weeks and can only be used to set up one account.
To accept this invitation and register for your account, visit
http://gmail.google.com/gmail/a-8698430991-5f7bac4a86-35ce22d306
Once you create your account, Manik Raina will be notified with 
your new @gmail.com address so you can stay in touch with Gmail!
If you haven't already heard about Gmail, it's a new search-based webmail 
service that offers:
- 1,000 megabytes (one gigabyte) of free storage
- Built-in Google search that instantly finds any message you want
- Automatic arrangement of messages and related replies into 
  "conversations"
- Text ads and related pages that are relevant to the content of your 
  messages
Gmail is still in an early stage of development. If you set up an 
account, you'll be able to keep it even after we make Gmail more 
widely available and as one of the system's early testers, you will 
be helping us improve the service through your feedback. We might ask 
for your comments and suggestions periodically and we appreciate your 
help in making Gmail even better.
Thanks,
The Gmail Team
