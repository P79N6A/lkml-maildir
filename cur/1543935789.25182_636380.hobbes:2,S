I have been reading about kprobes and one thing particularly bothers me
in the case of mmio-trace. The probe will actually service the page
fault, therefore it should be able force do_page_fault() to return at
the probe point. I could not figure out a way to do that.
Is it possible to do reliably with kprobes or markers?
Thanks for the replies.
