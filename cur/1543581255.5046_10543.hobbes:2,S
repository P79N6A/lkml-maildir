Hi!

select on files is unimplementable. You can't do background file IO the
same way you do background receiving of packets on socket. Filesystem is
synchronous. It can block.

No, it's not really possible on Linux. Use SYS$QIO call on VMS :-)
You can emulate asynchronous IO with kernel threads like FreeBSD and some
commercial Unices do, but you still need as many (possibly kernel) threads
as many requests you are servicing.

And how do you want to wait for other select()ed events if you are blocked
in wait_for_buffer in get_block (former bmap)?
Making real async IO would require to rewrite all filesystems and whole
VFS _from_scratch_. It won't happen.
