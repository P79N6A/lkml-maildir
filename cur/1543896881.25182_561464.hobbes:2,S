"It is planned to merge all three classification-directories into one
 place at /sys/subsystem/,  following the current layout of the
bus-directories."
Means that /sys/subsystem/ will have a devices/ directory, full of
symlinks to the devices, all in a flat list. Subsytem-global attribute
files/directories are not mixed with the devices in the same directory
like in /sys/class, it will also not contain any hierarchy like the
layout of /sys/block.

Yes, in this order (if you want to use it, but /sys/block will still be there):
  /sys/subsytem/block/devices/*
  /sys/class/block/*
  /sys/block/*/*

"one place at /sys/subsystem/"
Yes, it will be all pretty consistent, the event-environment contains
$SUBSYSTEM, we will  have /sys/subsystem/$SUBSYSTEM/devices/ directory
and at every device a symlink named "subsystem" pointing back to the
/sys/subsystem/$SUBSYSTEM/ directory.

If /sys/subsystem exists, just look at /sys/subsystem/*/devices/*, you
will find every kernel device here, with exactly the logic to access
it. Every device with a "dev" file, it is a char device, unless
$SUBYSTEM=="block".
If /sys/subsystem/ doesn't exist, you have to search all through
/sys/bus/, /sys/class/, /sys/block/, every directory with completely
different access pattern to find your device. You may want to look at
the udev code, it's all implemented there:

Yeah, that's sysfs. It exports all the useless kernel implementation
details, so that _what_not_to_do_ is the biggest problem we have. :)
There is much too much internal stuff available here, that never can
be kept stable in the usual sense, as long as we allow to change
kernel/driver internals at the same time.

It was a first cut, I did months ago, and sure, it needs some work.
Thanks,
