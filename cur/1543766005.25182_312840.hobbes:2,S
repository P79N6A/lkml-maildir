Logic dictates that requeues should maintain ordering, since we don't
want to reorder around the original io scheduler decisions. But you
could be requeuing more than one request.

Yeah, or perhaps the io scheduler might determine that a request has
higher prio than a requeued one.  I'm not sure what semantics to place
on soft-barrier, I've always taken it to mean 'maintain ordering if
convenient' where the hard-barrier must be followed.

Not sure I follow this - I don't want REQ_SOFTBARRIER set automatically
on elv_next_request() return, it should only happen on requeues.
REQ_STARTED implies that you should not pass this request, since the io
scheduler is required to return this request again until dequeue is
called. But the result is the same, correct.

You lost me, please detail exactly what behaviour you want documented :)
