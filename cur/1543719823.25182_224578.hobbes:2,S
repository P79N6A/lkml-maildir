And with that, you've worried about whether it's a potential DoS or
not.  I didn't bring it up to "kill" it - I brought it up to start a discussion,
because I felt that including that sort of feature without at least thinking
about the DoS issues was a bad idea.  Shipping it with a Kconfig or
sysctl flag, or using the capabilities framework, or any other similar
"allow the sysadmin to control it" feature is a different matter entirely...
