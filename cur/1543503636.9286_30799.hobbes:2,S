Subject: /sbin/update behaves weirdly under 2.3.11

When I first booted up 2.3.11 (compiled with gcc 2.95 19990718, 
running on a glibc-2.1.1 system), /sbin/update (both versions 1.3 
and 2.11) apparently wouldn't run.  After a while, it seemed that 
"/bin/sync" took a (relatively) long time to complete, so I decided 
that some daemon should be started.
Two hours later (with the process IDs in the 800's), /sbin/update 
did run successfully, but it tried to suck up as much CPU as 
possible.
Now I seem to be getting more normal behavior by running 
"/sbin/update -S", so that it calls sync() rather than bdflush(1,0).
Any suggestions?
