   Is it correct to limit it in anyway at the server ?
   Let the CLIENT to handle the  O_LARGEFILE testing, and let the SERVER
   to just assume it being the situation ?
   When the NFS server does file open, does it do it with O_LARGEFILE,
   or not ?   Is there a standardized way to pass that flag over NFSv3 ?
