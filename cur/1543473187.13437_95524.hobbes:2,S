Subject: Spontaneous reboots - 2.1.132 and tulip 0.90

	I recently bought a new NetGear PCI Ethernet card. It has the
crappy Lite-On tulip clone chip instead of the original DEC Tulip they
used to put on the board.
	When I used the tulip.c 0.90 driver from Donald's web site, the
card seems to work except that my computer spontanenously reboots within
12 hours of use. There doesn't seem to be any warning or logs, just
suddenly the screen goes blank and I'm staring at the BIOS memory test.
This also happens on 2.1.131-ac10 and I even tried the v0.90f testing
version of the tulip driver.
	Does anyone else see this odd behavior on their systems?
My system:
	Achitec ACHI156 motherboard (VIA VP3 chipset)
	AMD K6-166
	128MB SDRAM
	NCR53c810 PCI SCSI controller
	Internal iomega scsi ZIP drive
	Matrox Millennium II 8MB AGP
	Mozart ISA sound card
	Red Hat Linux 5.2
