Hello,
I have just compiled the new 2.2.2 kernel, and at boot time, just after
the loading of aic7xxx, and before that of intel EtherExpress 100(on an ASUS
P2B-LS) I got:
bug: kernel timer added twice at c019971c
and that don't go further...
I had had the same bug on 2.2.1ac6 and Alan Cox seems to have corrected it
in 2.2.1ac7 and 2.2.2ac1 as it works very well.
In fact, not exactly the same bug, as in 2.2.1ac6, it was at the same place
in boot, and the message was:bug: kernel timer added twice at c019abc2
Thanks for all the developpment you are doing in Linux,
	Greg
