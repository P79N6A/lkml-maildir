Thanks.

Unfortunately, I do not intend to prepare/test/submit a revision of the
patch for 2.6-mm, and I might only work on a 2.6 patch in a few months
from now.  Unless someone else takes care of this, the fix is likely to
get dropped on the floor.
Do you really think that getting this fix into 2.4 should be delayed
like that?  Please note that the patch affects error path only and that
without the patch things misbehave badly whenever the error occurs.
I really don't think the patch can make things worse, even if it were
buggy (although it's been tested with the error path triggered
specifically on 2.4).
