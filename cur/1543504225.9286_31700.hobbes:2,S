I have an ASUS P2B-D motherboard with a single PII/450.  I'd like to
upgrade to two CPUs.
Intel has very cleverly discontinued the PII/450, leaving me with the
following options:
1) installing a PII/400.  I assume that the 4x frequency multiple is
   hard-coded onto the processor cartridge somehow.  Has anyone tried
   running two CPUs at two different speeds in the same box
   simultaneously?
2) installing a PIII/450.  I doubt there is any electrical compatibility
   problem, but I wonder if there is some trick to getting Linux to
   treat the PIII as a PII (i.e. it would be really bad if the kernel
   tried to enable MMX on both CPUs).  Has anyone tried running two
   different model CPUs in the same box simultaneously?
3) Throw out/sell the PII and install two PIIIs.  This option seems
   somewhat unappetizing.
I know there used to be problems running different revisions of the
Pentium Pro together.  Does anyone know what these problems were, and
whether I would experience similar or worse difficulties with a PII/PIII
mix?
