bug is definitely too strong a word. It might be unnecessary to disable bhs, 
but I don't see any bug in here as long as you can't show a case where
the smp_call_function() is called from BHs.
There was a patch floating around to use it from sysrq to display state
of all CPUs (and sysrq is softirq), but I don't think that ever
made it mainline.
And smp_call_function() can be called from panic which can violate
quite some assumptions, but some deadlock possibility there is ok.
I also don't like making it soft/hard irq save because that would
make it much more intrusive to the machine for no good reason
(e.g. slab can call it quite often in some cases)
The _bh should be probably just removed and possibly a WARN_ON added.
