Either the i2c devices need to be able to support a list of permitted
adapters, or the i2c adapters need a list of permitted clients. A single
class isn't adequate. Consider the following scenario:
The FooTV123 has multiplexor MX3R0K3 and frontend XYZZY, the TVMatic3000
has frontend XYZZY and multiplexor MX31337, and the FooTV124 has
multiplexor MX31337 and frontend FR012. All three cards are installed in
the same machine. In the worst case the probe code for MX31337 puts
MX3R0K3 into a state that requires a hard reset.
Manual connection of clients makes it easier to develop a driver outside
the kernel tree, then merge it when ready, without having to allocate a
number from a central authority.
Creating the adapter with a list of permitted clients is also an
adequate solution for a bus like I2C which doesn't properly support
probing. The OCP bus on PowerPC has no explicit probing, and uses a
similar approach of creating the bus with a list of the devices possible
for that PowerPC model.
