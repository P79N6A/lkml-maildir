I hate to follow up to my own email, but the fact that
they're not in any VMA could mean we leak these pages
at exit() time.
Which means a security bug, as well as the potential to
end up with bad pointers in kernel space, eg. think about
the rmap code jumping to a no longer existing mm_struct.
The more I think about it, the more I agree with Andrew
that it would be really really nice to get rid of them ;)
