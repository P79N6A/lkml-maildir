Hi All,
Ingo was not aware of the sourceforge project, and suggested me to
resend my reply to lkml. Does the patch work for you guys? Do I do
something wrong? That would be more than possible. :-)

Is this different from the netconsole project on sourceforge? The last
message on that lists seemes to be from july, and you didn't cc it.

Can you also make older patches available for testing? The current
netconsole-2.4.10-B1 doesn't seem to work for me on plain 2.4.10 or
2.4.9-ac15 patched with Rik his latest vm patch. The patch applies fine,
but I can't load the module:
cuddle:~# uname -a
Linux cuddle 2.4.9-ac15 #1 Thu Sep 27 13:54:51 CEST 2001 i686 unknown
cuddle:~# insmod netconsole dev=eth0 target_ip=0x0a604875 source_port=6666 target_port=5555
Using /lib/modules/2.4.9-ac15/kernel/drivers/net/netconsole.o
/lib/modules/2.4.9-ac15/kernel/drivers/net/netconsole.o: init_module: Operation not permitted
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters, including invalid IO or IRQ parameters
The same message for plain 2.4.10, and the same when I use the script
netconsole-server included in netconsole-client-20010927. I also tried
it with the target_eth_byte0 thingies, with the mac address from the
local nic.
Target ip address is 10.96.72.117 (I hope 0x0a604875 is oke)

Somebody more or less asked this already, but, will things like SysRq
work in the future? That would be great. :-)  Thnx!
