This patch below seems to fix point 1 on my system,
causing pciehp to become aware of already-inserted cards on module load.
It's not perfect, but I believe it does show the kind of functionality
that's missing from the driver.
The resume() function will need something similar, to poll the slots
on resume and call pciehp_enable_slot() or pciehp_disable_slot()
as appropriate.
I suspect this is broken even on machines that do have ACPI BIOS
support.

Not for kernel inclusion (yet), but..
