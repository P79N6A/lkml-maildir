Hi!
I have a stock Redhat 6.1 with its kernel 2.2.12-20, which I think it
means 2.2.12 + a lot of patches to make it more stable and more decent.
And now I need to install the ide-xxx patch from Hedrick's site, because I
need more HDD power from my raid array so I put each disk in a different
channel. I also use NFS for file serving.
So can anyone tell me what kernel can give me new RAID (0.9 I think),
fresh and working knfsd, HPT366, and possibily all the RedHat enhacements?
