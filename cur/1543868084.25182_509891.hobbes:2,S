Per this principle, it would seem that only source code and
hand-crafted object code would be governed by copyright, since
compilation is also an automated process.
FWIW, 
http://www.fsfla.org/?q=en/node/128#1
 touches a very similar
issue, also covered in the upcoming release of the video of the FSFLA
session in the 5th GPLv3 conference.

IANAL, but I understand this is correct.  However, the output is
probably a derivative work of both.
Also, it's the fact that A needs to be linked with B, or vice-versa,
that's a clue that A is likely to be a derived work from B, or
vice-versa, even before they're linked together.
