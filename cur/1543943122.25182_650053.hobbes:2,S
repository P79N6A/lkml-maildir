Hm, the struct in wakeup.h doesn't contain it too.  Why exactly is it
necessary?

Yes, I'll fix that in one of the next iterations.

Yeah.  Pavel, what's at 0x3f00, btw?

In fact, I'd prefer to remove .signature from the header and use the
end_signature only, so that I can use struct wakeup_header for addressing
the header fields in the assembly too.

Do you mean placing the header at the end will fill the area between it and the
code with zeros, so the .bss clearing is not necessary?

Well, I think we can do that.
