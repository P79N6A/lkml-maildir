Steven, did you see the NULL ->b_this_page on SMP or UP?
Stian Jordet had an SMP server, but he also was seeing oopses with v2.6:

He upgraded the box and stopped seeing the crashes, running 
recent v2.6. 
However, he also mentioned that his crashes started after upgrading 
from v2.4.19->2.4.22. Should search the diff between them looking for 
anything suspicious.
I can't figure out from the archived reports if this is UP or SMP only. 
Frank van Maarseveen has also seen the journal_try_to_free_buffers() NULL 
b_this_page. Frank, were you running SMP or UP when you reported the oops 
with 2.4.23?

Oh, yes, indeed. 
Maybe adding this (untested) to v2.4 mainline helps? Comments?
