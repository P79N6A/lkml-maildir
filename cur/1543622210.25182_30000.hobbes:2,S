No.  The issues of this have been discussed on the netfilter developer meeting
(where Lennert was also present) - there's a summary available at 
http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/events/netfilter-ws-2001-summary.txt
The basic issue is that it adds multiple new struct sk_buff members, which
is generally not considered as a good idea by the networking gods ;)
