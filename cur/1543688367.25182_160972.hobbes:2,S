Hello,
when my system is booting I can see such a message:
kernel: MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal, correctable incident occurred 
on CPU 0.
kernel: Bank 0: e664000000000185
What does it mean ??? My kernel 2.6.0-test4 has applyed "Nick's scheduler 
policy v8" patch. 
When I boot 2.4.x kernel I can't see this message.
Thanks,
Tomasz Czaus
