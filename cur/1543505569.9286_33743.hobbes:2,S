I can, but not without some fixups to the posted program -- see the
filemap_nopage() thread for details, there seems to be a problem with that
function in the later 2.3 kernels.
I've not got access to a *nix box at the moment, so the following from
memory
(I can't remember the exact constant names off the top of my head):
>> #include <unistd.h>
>> #include <sys/mman.h>
Various other include files needed here..
>> main()
>> {
>>         int fd;

>>         fd = open("file", 0666);
fd = open("file", xxCREAT|xxRDWR, 0666);
>>         lseek(fd, 1000000, 0);
>>         mem = mmap(0, 1000000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd,
0);

if (mem == (caddr_t)-1)

Yup, the open() fails and thus the mmap() does too (invalid fd passed);
pointers are unsigned so you can't use the <=0 check on the result
(successfully).
