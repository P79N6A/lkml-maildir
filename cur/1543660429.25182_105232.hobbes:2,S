Kinda cruel making you do all this work when Linus is unlikely to take the
patch anyway ;)
Thanks for the explanation - all is much clearer - it looks like very cool
technology.
- <asm/if.h> doesn't mean much to me.  Network interface, if anything.  How
  about <asm/asm-macros.h> ?
- It's quite conceivable that the infrastructure will be used for other
  forms of asm-mangling.  Those "Q2" things hurt like hell.  Is there no
  other way?
- application/octet-stream!
