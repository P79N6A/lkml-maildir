If the cpu has only 1 core, we could call it single-core, so it's reasonable to use 0 as its core id.

Current kernel will output core id by /proc/cpuinfo if a physical cpu has 2 threads, no matter if it's a multi-core, or just a multi-thread. To be consistent with /proc/cpuinfo, I think we need export core id and its default value is 0.

As my previous email says, there are concerns/issues to do so. A compromise is that the patch could register a sysdev driver. When the cpu becomes offline from online, we don't delete the topology kobj. The compromise has a defect. If the cpu is never online since machine boots, the topology info of the cpu is incorrect.
