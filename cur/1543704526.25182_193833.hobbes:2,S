You could certainly do that.  Given disk block #N you need to search all
files on the disk asking "who owns this block".  The FIBMAP ioctl can be
used on most filesystems (ext2, ext3, others..) to find out which blocks a
file is using.   See bmap.c in
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/ext3-tools.tar.gz
Unfortunately you cannot determine a directory's blocks in this way. 
Ext3's directories live in the /dev/hda1 pagecache anyway.  ext2's
directories each have their own pagecache.
