Hm, shouldn't there be command line option to instruct kernel not to 
overcommit memory?  For servers that don't really need disk, and 
wouldn't have much use for swap anyhow (like firewalls for example).  I 
do vaugly remember of such option in OSF/1 (Compaq Unix or whatever it 
is called nowdays) or Solaris.  Not sure which one.  Or maybe both.  If 
I remember correctly, there the default was not to overcommit, and (not 
recommended) option would allow kernel to overcommit.  Or I might be 
wrong about the default setting, but the option was there.  I don't 
remember if application that tried to allocate more memory that there 
was free on the system would be killed or if system call would simply fail.
