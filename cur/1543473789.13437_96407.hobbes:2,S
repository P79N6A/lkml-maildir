They are not yet. I am currently trying hard to find and fix bugs and  
increase stability as far as I can to make the many new features easier to  
do.
1.0.7a will be out soon, serving as the base for the role module to be in  
1.0.8, which in turn will be used for ACL. The models are pretty far  
developed on paper, but not yet implemented. As usual, there will be pre- 
versions to be tested in the pre-dir.

PSL has been on hold for a while due to Vadim being sunk in work. It is  
meant to provide a security centered basic Linux distribution using RSBAC  
kernels.
