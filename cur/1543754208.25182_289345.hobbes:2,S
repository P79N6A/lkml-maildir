Not sure. One on kernel version being <= 2.6.10 would probably serve
your purposes, though it's not particularly well thought of. I suspect
people would suggest splitting up the codebase instead of sharing it
between 2.4.x and 2.6.x, where I've no idea how well that sits with you.
I vaguely suspected something like this would happen, but there were
serious and legitimate concerns about new usage of the 32-bit unsafe
methods being reintroduced, so at some point the old hook had to go.
