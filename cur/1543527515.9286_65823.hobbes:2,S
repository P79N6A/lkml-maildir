Just wondering before I start on this long venture into the unknown. Has
anyone checked into, started, or know of any work being done on a SAF-TE
driver for RAID enclosures? Please contact me if you know of anything that
might help me in getting something setup (pointer to the spec since
www.safte.org seems to be down, skeleton code, etc...).
