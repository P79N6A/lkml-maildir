FWIW, large system scalability, especially NUMA is not tractable with a 'one
size (algorithm) fits all' approach, and can be a significant test of the
degree of modularity in your system.  Different relative costs of access to
the different levels of the memory hierarchy and different models of cache
concurrency, especially, tend to make what works for system A be maximally
pessimal for system B.

Nothing coordinated, AFAIK...

Most of the times I've talked about this topic it
was in person with other developers at various
conferences.
For the VM subsystem and the scheduler we have some
ideas to improve scalability for NUMA machines. It's
not been implemented yet, but for most of it the
design seems to be pretty ok and ready to be implemented
for 2.5.
OTOH, some of the develish details still aren't resolved.
If there are people interested in discussing this topic,
I'll setup a mailing list for it ...
regards,
Rik
