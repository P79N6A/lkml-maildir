I understand, but I'm also not sure if its progress to duplicate a  
major of a file that is common.
In this case it might be better handled by having specific versions  
per "sub-arch".  I think the key is determining which files should be  
handled via sub-arch diffs and which should be handled via ifdef's in  
the file.
Some cases like ppc_asm are so similar that it seems better to have a  
single file and ifdef the specific case.

Will avoid touch any other mm related headers than :)
