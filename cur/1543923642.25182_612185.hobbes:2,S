I disagree.
Traditionally, Linux has given a process all capabilities when the
UID changed to 0 (either by setuid(2) or executing a SUID binary).
This has been relieved over the years, and right now with LSMs in the
field, it is possible to 'deactivate' this special case for UID 0.
SELinux does not have this special case for UID 0. Neither does it
seem to use capabilities (quick grep through the source). So
basically, all users are the same, and no one has capabilities by
default. Does SELinux thus break with other LSMs?
Now assume a SELinux system where all users have all capabilities
(and the policy that is in place restricts the use of these
capabilities then) -- should not be that unlikely. Does that break
with other LSMs?
