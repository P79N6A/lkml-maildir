There is a problem with the swap cache. Before returning from
delete_from_swap_cache we must do a flushpage to remove the buffer headers
as well.
Right now my tree with the SMP-threaded-shrink_mmap with the double-LRU queue
is working stable even under heavy swap, but I still have an obvious
memleak in the buffer headers (they increase continously ...). I also still
have some minor race somewhere since sometime I read wrong data from the
page cache (for example if I run two CVS operations on the same repository).
I'll think about that tomorrow (at least now the kernel survive _any_ kind
of stress testing).
