But that is not a patch intended for Linus, it is intended to enable all
the XFS features. I have a couple of kernel patches which total 46298 bytes
which get you a working XFS filesystem in the kernel, and I could do
lots of things to make them smaller. When you hit header files in the
correct manner for different platforms the size tends to mushroom.
These lines are all in different fcntl.h files for example:
+#define O_INVISIBLE    01000000 /* invisible I/O, for DMAPI/XDSM */
+#define O_INVISIBLE    0x80000 /* invisible I/O, for DMAPI/XDSM */
+#define O_INVISIBLE    02000000 /* invisible I/O, for DMAPI/XDSM */
+#define O_INVISIBLE    01000000 /* invisible I/O, for DMAPI/XDSM */
+#define O_INVISIBLE    01000000 /* invisible I/O, for DMAPI/XDSM */
+#define O_INVISIBLE    0x200000 /* invisible I/O, for DMAPI/XDSM */
+#define O_INVISIBLE    01000000 /* invisible I/O, for DMAPI/XDSM */
+#define O_INVISIBLE    0x200000 /* invisible I/O, for DMAPI/XDSM */
+#define O_INVISIBLE    01000000 /* invisible I/O, for DMAPI/XDSM */
+#define O_INVISIBLE    02000000 /* invisible I/O, for DMAPI/XDSM */
+#define O_INVISIBLE    0x80000 /* invisible I/O, for DMAPI/XDSM */
+#define O_INVISIBLE    02000000 /* invisible I/O, for DMAPI/XDSM */
You make the patches look a lot bigger than they really are. There is
a difference between a patch which is placing things in the correct
places and one which is designed to be as short as possible.
