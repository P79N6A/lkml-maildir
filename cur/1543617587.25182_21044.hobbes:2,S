On x86 that's true; many other architectures - alpha, ia64, m68k,
mips, mips64, parisc, ppc, ppc64, sparc, sparc64 - keep current in a
register already and thus it is slightly more expensive to pass it as
a parameter instead of just using current in the function.
Either way surely the cost is tiny, and the maintainability
considerations should prevail.  Having a function which takes a
task_struct * parameter which _has_ to be current sounds to me like an
invitation for somebody to get it wrong down the track.
