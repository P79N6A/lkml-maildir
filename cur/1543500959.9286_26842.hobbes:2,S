careful.  Don't be so willing to discount people until you've actually
interacted with them.
I've talked with some ZD Labs people, and they're at least interested in
investigating letting us use their lab for a bit.  It would be silly to
ignore this offer, as they have all the hardware setup and ready to go and
good experience running this sort of thing.

why?  should we also use a single ide drive?  multiple 100mb nics simply
do not aggregate traffic as well as a single gigabit card.  If I were
setting up a site of this magnitude I sure as hell wouldn't want to mess
around with the silliness of having lots of nics.

The software problem is mostly fixed in 2.3, the fundamental hardware
problem still remains.
