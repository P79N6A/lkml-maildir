The configure script has almost nothing to do with this! autoconf
etc. is just little bits on the surface. So pardon if I question the
relevance of your experience in this area.
The real problems with Perl is that it exercises almost all of your
libc, uses floating point math, dlopen() and a lot of other
funnies. Successfully running Perl's test suite is a very good
indicator for the completeness of your libc. On the other hand gcc and
the development toolchain are remarkably easy to accomodate on that
front.
