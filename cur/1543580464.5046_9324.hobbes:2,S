depends on the network card.  The adaptecs have one.  the Obsidion X16 and
X24 have them.  Many dual channel SCSI cards use them, and even some nicer
motherboards have them onboard.  I would like to recommend autodetection
at boot, but I'm assuming that someone has looked into it and determined
it impractical?
