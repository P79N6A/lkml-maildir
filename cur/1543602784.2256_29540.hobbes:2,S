thanks Albert - i've added it to the patch, and the latest
netconsole-2.4.10-C2 version can be downloaded from:
	
http://redhat.com/~mingo/netconsole-patches/
NOTE: new client-side utilities are needed as well.
other changes:
 - netconsole-server fix from Andreas Dilger
 - introduced versioning and offsetting of output, to display messages in
   the correct order even if interim routers reorder packets. Future
   netconsole-clients should reliably detect the right protocol version.
 - small cleanups.
	Ingo
