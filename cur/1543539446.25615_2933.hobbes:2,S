You're missing the point. If root _wants_ to damage the drive, this patch
won't stop him. He merely loads a module that duplicates the old code and
away we go. If I mention it on Bugtraq, someone will probably post the
source for such a module within a week. Fighting it is futile.
This doesn't mean we shouldn't try to prevent people from doing it by
accident, it just means the fix should be as simple and non-intrusive to
the kernel as possible. If the fix is anything more than:
 if(NAUGHTY_IDE_COMMAND)
 {
     printk("NAUGHTY__IDE_COMMAND attempted\n");
     return -EBADUSER;
 }
..then it might not be worth fixing. I'd even be ok with:
 if(NAUGHTY_IDE_COMMAND) panic(); /* root tried to kill drive */
..as it keeps root from doing anything else bad.
