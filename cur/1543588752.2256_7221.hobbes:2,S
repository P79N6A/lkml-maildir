Subject: init_rwsem redefinition warning in usbdevice_fs.h

Hi, again
i do not know whether it may be important, but the warning
makes me anyway curios.
In 2.4.3-ac13 the compiler says that init_rwsem in the
usbdevice_fs.h is redefined. It was previously defined in a .ver-file.
/*
 * sigh. rwsemaphores do not (yet) work from modules
 */
 
#define rw_semaphore semaphore
#define init_rwsem init_MUTEX <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< here
#define down_read down
#define down_write down
#define up_read up
#define up_write up
Should it be fixed? And, maybe the other define's around
should be fixed too?

P.S. the original warning (gcc-2.95.2):
In file included from hub.c:24:
linux-2.4.3-ac13/include/linux/usbdevice_fs.h:170: warning: `init_rwsem' redefined
linux-2.4.3-ac13/include/linux/modules/rwsem-spinlock.ver:2: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
