Hmm. I really think you should take this up with the gcc people. That 
looks like a gcc bug - because there really is nothing that guarantees 
that the asm doesn't change the array that "x" points to, and the asm 
clearly talks about clobbering memory.

I can't explain it. I do think you've found a gcc bug.
That said, the kernel mostly uses "asm volatile()" _together_ with a 
memory clobber for these kinds of things, so it sounds like the kernel 
wouldn't be impacted. But you're definitely right - the above report makes 
me worry.

Well, that's likely just a subtle register allocation issue, and 
understandable. Generating perfect code is impossible, you want to 
generate good code on average.
