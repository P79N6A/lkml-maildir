btw., i dont think it's the early-bootup behavior of lockdep that causes 
your oops. I think %gs somehow ended up being invalid upon pagefault 
entry, well after bootup. Not sure why. Andi's patch just papers over 
this i believe.
ah ... found it meanwhile: in the syscall exit path the PDA patches 
restore the userspace %gs too early, trace_hardirqs_on() is called 
_after_ the restoring of %gs. Will send a patch in a few minutes.
