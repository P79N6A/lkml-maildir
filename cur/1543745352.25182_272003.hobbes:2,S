Your logic is equally flawed.

s/relicense/distribute/g;  You can't relicense code without owning the 
original
copyright.  You _can_ however, receive a license to distribute.
If I receive a binary from them, I receive the original "dual" license. 
This means
that anyone who receives it may license it using GPL version "2" or, at 
their
option, any later version.  This means that when I get some binaries 
from some
random company that used your mythical version 3 to distribute under the
terms of any BSD license, I _also_ receive a license to the same code 
under
the terms of GPL v2 (at my option :-D).  This means that since my 
license from
company X is GPL v2 (at my option), I must receive sources under GPL 
v2. In
practice this means that you _can't_ change much of what the GPL says in
future versions, at least as far as I can see, without causing said 
future version
to be legally invalid.

And I can equally legally demand the sources under GPL version 2, at my
option, and you will be forced to give them to me, not at your option 
:-D.
