i'm sure this has already been covered, but i've had problmes with my mail
recently.  Every time i try to open an {A,E,x}term i get
aterm: can't open slave tty (null)
aterm: can't open slave tty (null)
is this a known issue?  is there a workaround for this?
i'm running a gentoo box with everything up to date...
