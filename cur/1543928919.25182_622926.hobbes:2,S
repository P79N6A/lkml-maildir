yep, i already tried to check how well it integrates to x86.git:
 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/29/93
the code does not seem to be layered correctly: i'd suggest to read the 
discussion between Roland McGrath and Alan Stern on lkml, about kwatch 
-> hw_breakpoint, to see how a more general debugging framework 
can/should be built. These things shouldnt be limited to user-space 
alone, the kernel could probably use hardware tracing even more than 
user-space could. (because it's a much harder to debug environment)
