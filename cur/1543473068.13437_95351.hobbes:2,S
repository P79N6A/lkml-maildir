Uhm, you need a compiler to make it? Some of us like having vast amounts of
power available from the shell, for minimal/thin client/embedded applications.
This means small kernel additions that are vastly generic. (For vast
flexabilty)
But I guess with all the narrowed minded jerk off's in this thread, those
things aren't commonly used enough and thus not important to Linux. We may as
well rip out serial console, /dev/nvram, initrd, romfs, and other such things.
They are useless bloat.
