I wrote a patch to the linux networking part of the kernel which allows
you to aviod denial of service. Basicaly it does a more accurate
accounting of sockets and does not let more then MAXCONNFROMONEIP
connetions from the same ip.
Do you think this patch is of any use ? If yes , I will send the sources.
