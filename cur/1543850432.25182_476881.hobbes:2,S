I don't see a cpu_delay, I see a cpu_delay_total.  This is the CPU's
cumulative delay and is only accessible through the user-space accounting 
program Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c.  It reports the number of 
delay values recorded and the real total, virtual total, and delay total; 
each of these are cumulative.
In the use case for cpu_count, taking the difference of two successive 
cpu_count readings as reported by getdelays.c would find the number of 
delays experienced in that interval.  This is described in the program's 
documentation so by definition the count must be cumulative.  It is also 
possible to find the average delay but dividing cpu_delay_total by 
cpu_count.
The original code is correct and accumulation is appropriate.
