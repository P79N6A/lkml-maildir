   By the way, what's the advantage in probing in slot order? I guess it
should be enough to preserve slot order for devices belonging to single
driver which is exactly what we currently do.
   (Assuming we're speaking of `natural' slot ordering (i.e., by increasing
value of devfn, not according to slot numbers reported by the PCI BIOS).)
				Have a nice fortnight
