Subject: bug in make_request() when accessing last sector

Hi Linus,
I've stumbled upon an error in the make_request() function in
drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c.
To my knowledge it applies to all versions of Linux, up to and including
2.2.x. It is the
comparison that tests whether a given block is past the end of the
device.
-------- original code ---------
   if (blk_size[major][MINOR(bh->b_rdev)] < (sector + count)>>1) {
--------------------------------
this comparison is not correct as it fails to recognize the last block
as a valid block within the device.
For example consider:
   device length = 2797060 bytes.
   blk_size[][] would be 2797060/1024 = 2731
   the last valid sector is 2797060/512 = 5463
   but the above comparison erroneously fails to recognize this (2731 <
(5463+1)>>1).
   the line should read:
----------- proposed code -----------
   if (((blk_size[major][MINOR(bh->b_rdev)]<<1)+count) < sector) {
-------------------------------------
   which should fix the problem.
The error would only show up when requesting the last sector, which
explains why we have not seen it in action before. I've been working
with a custom filesystem mounted on a loop device, so I have seen it a
lot :)
I enclose a patch for 2.0.36, but as I believe it affects all versions
of Linux, someone will have to make patches for the other kernel
versions also.

I'm new to releasing kernel patches so be gentle :)
