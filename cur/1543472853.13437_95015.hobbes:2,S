Unlike the blabering in the rest of this thread, this is actually a real
problem.
I guess the same this exists with serial ports, an that is 'solved' (somewhat)
with lock files. /dev/repeat0-9 could also be available to help this.
Any better ideas?

Well sure. Example: In the 'wipe' thread it was brought up that random and
urandom are too slow. 
dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/repeat bs=512 count=1.
cat /dev/repeat
Very fast, and refilled several times over the operation, random enough.

IMO you should be able to accomplish this without resorting to C.
