I suggest reading the very end of arch/arm/kernel/sys_arm.c; I'd rather
avoid adding more and more hacks like that to the kernel if at all
possible.
One solution (already mentioned elsewhere) is that we start avoiding
passing 64-bit arguments and instead pass two 32-bit instead.  This
nicely avoids the alignment restrictions for 64-bit args in ABIs.
(The issue for ARM is that with anything other than the "fd, mode,
offset, len" layout we will have to deal with different ABI argument
layouts, or implement our own wrapper function as done for
sys_arm_sync_file_range.)
I think the problem comes down to "what is the argument layout which
causes the least amount of problems for the complete set of architectures."
For ARM, that's the "fd, mode, offset, len" layout.
