   My name is Declan O'Shanahan and I am a computer
   science student in Trinity College, Dublin in Ireland.
   I am trying to find out if there is a way of producing
   large integers in the linux kernel. I have found two
   packages (lip and gnu mp) both have functions for
   producing large integers in user space. I was
   wondering if anybody has already produced a set of
   kernel functions to do this?
No, no one has done this.  Arguably, RSA authentication (I assume you're
trying to do something like that), should be done outside the kernel via
some kind of user-space callout.
