No, it can be updated, and I have done that once before.  It became a
little more stable, but not much.  I forget the details, but either
under USB or FireWire it would lockup or corrupt transfers.  
I seem to remember using the serialize_io=1 parameter too, but it
didn't help either.

Sure, I'd be happy to ship it to the developer you think could make
the most use of this thing.    I'll have to dig out the specs when I
get home.  Maybe look back in the archives, because I know I wrote
about this before, probably back in 2005 sometime.
