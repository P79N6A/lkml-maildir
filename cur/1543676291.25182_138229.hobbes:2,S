Linus should have a firm position already, pruned from CC:.

Please let the above sink in a moment.

My words were "all or nothing".  Linus was against nothing, so the
answer is all, that simple.
As to your "someone comes up with a better zlib" concern, this has
happened already.  An guess what, we ignored it.  So unless you come
up with a patch to get the 1.1.4 changes into the kernel and describe
what the two magic bits are all about, I couldn't care less.
