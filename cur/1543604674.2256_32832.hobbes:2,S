The user-mode port of 2.4.12 is available.
The highlights:
Redid the signal delivery code so that it is possible to write-protect physical
memory from userspace.  This turns out to be expensive, so this version of
UML is noticably slower than previous ones.  Memory protection will be made
optional until I can get some support from the host kernel for doing it
more quickly.
An ancient crash in the console driver has been fixed.  This was easiest to
see when booting a distro, such as SuSE, that doesn't put a getty on the main 
console.
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB is now available in the configuration.
uml_router is now known as uml_switch.  It now has a -hub option.
