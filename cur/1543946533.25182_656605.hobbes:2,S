Currently, we BUG_ON having a PFN in our tables and not being able
to sleep.  These are mappings which MPT has never supported in the past
and XPMEM was already not allowing page faults for VMAs which are not
anonymous so it should never happen.  If the file-backed operations can
ever get changed to allow for sleeping and a customer has a need for it,
we would need to change XPMEM to allow those types of faults to succeed.
