After being up a few hours on 2.2.11, I was playing quake1 over the net with
a friend.  Playing for about 15 minutes, it locked up.  quake couldn't be
killed, but was running.  the system wouldn't even reboot.  The sound that
quake had been playing kept playing over and over.  sysrq-<anythign> didn't
work.
No oops was recorded.
