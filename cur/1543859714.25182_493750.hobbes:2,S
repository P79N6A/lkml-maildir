But there is no legal or moral obligation for the carmake to sell you
the service manual for the vehicle or provide you with their periodic
service bulletins...

The information needed to make it work does not necessarily include
any information about how it works. A closed driver is a perfectly
valid part of the product.
Try this thought experiment: suppose the "driver" were actually
implemented by firmware loaded into the device in the factory and not
field replaceable. Do you consider that to be immoral? Why should the
technological accident of the driver being plugged into the OS change
the appropriateness?

No such change has occurred. There was a very limited legal change to
say that it did not violate copyright to attempt to circumvent the
protection of the lock. There is no legal requirement that the carrier
unlock the device (at least in the US). [I personally believe that
they should be required to, but I'm only responding to your assertion
that there has been a major change on this point.]

I disagree. The manufacturer has a right to choose to sell its devices
under any legal business model. Part of that model is deciding what
level of support to provide and what systems to support in selling it.
It's not a question of whether they "have a legitimate interest in "
doing anything - they have the complete right to choose where to spend
their development dollars. Choosing not to write technical manuals for
the public is a completely valid choice. It's your option whether to
buy or not, knowing the manufacturer's choice.
