I don't personally.  The last figure was 17 percent of the, (ahem),
"personal computer market," or some such quantity which I saw,
whatever that works out to as a total.
As long as I'm here, I would make that quote present, and take out the
date: "Worldwide, Linux has 10 to 20 million users."  There's not much
to go on.
