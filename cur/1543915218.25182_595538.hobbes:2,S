OK, I'm a little lost at this point (what's n?  What's to_do?), but I'll
take your word for it.
I'd be kinda curious when exactly the behavior changed and why.
Also I suppose we should check which version of nfs-utils that fix is in
and make sure distributions are getting the fixed nfs-utils before they
get the new libc, or we're going to see this bug a lot....

OK!
Let me know if the problem's fixed.
