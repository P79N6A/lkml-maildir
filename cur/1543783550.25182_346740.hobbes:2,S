Hello,
I've bought "new" LS-120 drive and found that software eject does not 
work with 2.6.13 kernel:
root@pentium:~# eject /dev/hdc
eject: unable to eject, last error: Invalid argument
The drive spins up and after a while the command fails.
This appears in dmesg after each eject attempt:
  hdc: unknown partition table
ide-floppy: hdc: I/O error, pc = 1b, key =  5, asc = 24, ascq =  0
When I boot 2.4.31, eject works fine.
