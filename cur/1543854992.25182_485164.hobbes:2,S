No it does not, it tells the driver core to "bind this device with this
driver, _if_ the driver will accept it".

Yes it does:
	echo -n BUS_ID > /sys/bus/foo_bus/drivers/foo_driver/unbind
	echo -n BUS_ID > /sys/bus/foo_bus/drivers/baz_driver/bind
and you are set.  That's the way other distros use this functionality :)
