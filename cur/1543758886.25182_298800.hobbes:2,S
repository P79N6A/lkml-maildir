BSF moves the tape backwards over filemarks. tar tries to move over one 
filemark. It does not find it because it ends to the beginning of the 
tape. This is why the operation fails. However, the tape is at the 
beginning and this is the correct place with regard to what is done next.

It is not fixable in the kernel. The beginning of the tape is a special 
case because there is no filemark. Any application should take this into 
account. We could fake a filemark there but this would lead to problems 
because then we could "skip" backwards indefinitely even when the tape 
moves nowhere. This could confuse other applications.
If seek with tape is changed back to returning success, this would enable 
correct tar --verify at the beginning of the tape. However, I am not sure 
what happens if we are not at the beginning. I will investigate this and 
suggest a long term fix to the tar people (a fix that should be compatible 
with all Unix tape semantics I know) and also suggest possible fixes to st 
(this may include automatic writing of a filemark when BSF is used after 
writes).
If you think want to make st return success for seeks even if nothing 
happens (as it did earlier), I don't have anything against that. It would 
solve the practical problem several people have reported recently. (My 
recommendation for the people seeing this problem is to do verification 
separately with 'tar -d'.)
