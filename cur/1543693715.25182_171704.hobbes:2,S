When the "compatible" device is a copy.

Yes it does. Market pressure. The ROM may cost US$0.50.
During the lifetime of the product, that may mean over
a million dollars in lost profit. And, if you were a
stockholder, you would not like that. Or, if you
were an employee who lost his job because the company
couldn't quite make up the cost of your salary. Every
dime saved in the production cost of a high-volume product
means several jobs saved.
