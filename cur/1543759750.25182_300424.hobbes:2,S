Subject: Error message during boot: module ide-detect not found

Hello,
when booting a 2.6 kernel of a Debian distribution (Sarge) I always get
the above error message. Additionally, the ide chipset is
not detected and hard disc and ide - cdrom drives are not available.
In '/etc/modules' , 'ide-detect' is listed. When I change this to
'ide-generic', everything is fine.
This might be a problem of Debian distribution ( Sarge ) or more general
??
