Subject: [PATCH 00/11] UBD driver little cleanups for 2.6.19
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Many cleanups for the UBD driver; these are mostly microfixes, I was waiting to
finish and reorder also locking fixes (the code works, it is only to resplit,
reproof-read and changelogs must be written) but I decided to send these ones
for now. The rest will maybe be merged for 2.6.20.
The only locking change is a conversion of a spinlock to a mutex, but it is
correct anyway, and it has been tested (which is enough since it relates
just to the setup/teardown path) with all debugging options active; I did
boot-test and hotplug/hotunplug test.
