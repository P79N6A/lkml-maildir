Then the quirk effectively does nothing - the IDE controller is most
likely in legacy mode, and therefore does not use its PCI interrupt (it
uses legacy IRQs 15 and 14 instead).

On this system the quirk would matter only for these USB controllers.

When IO-APIC is used, the "& 0x0f" part of the quirk becomes relevant -
in this mode 0 in the register means IO-APIC IRQ 16, 1 means IRQ 17,
etc...  However, not all chips work like this - e.g., the builtin audio
device of VT8237 has fixed IRQ routing in IO-APIC mode and ignores the
value of PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE completely.
