This is SLES8. You don't want to update the glibc.

And how do we achieve this for all the libfs users like tmpfs etc.? At least
with my patch you can seek to the offsets of existing entries. Even that isn't
possible at the moment if you remove directory entries. But I don't know how to
implement that for the offsets of unlinked entries.
