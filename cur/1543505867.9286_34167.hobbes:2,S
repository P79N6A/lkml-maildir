I'm in need of a hash function for WCHAN data. On the Alpha, I ought to
get good results by shifting right by 3 bits and then masking to fit
the table size. Intel has oddly made instructions 128/3 bits long, so
I don't really know what to expect.
Are code addresses in terms of bytes?
Can an instruction act alone or only as part of a group?
In other words, can I expect the low 4 bits of WCHAN to be zero?
