    It looks like getsockopt() function call always returns a default value of zero for MSS parameter (maximum segement size) unless the user has preset it to some different value by calling setsockopt(). 
   Checking with the source code (net/ipv4/tcp_output.c) I have discovered that Linux uses three different variables for MSS (listed below are fragments form comments found in lines 254-274 in the above mentioned source file):
	- "user_mss is mss set by user by TCP_MAXSEG"
	- "mss_cache is current effective sending mss"
	- "mss_clamp is mss negotiated at connection setup.
                 It is minumum of user_mss and mss received with SYN"
    As you may guess getsockopt()/setsockopt() when called w/ TCP_MAXSEG operates *only* on the user_mss. While I find perfectly normal for setsockopt() to operate on (that is : modify) user_mss - since the user should be provided w/ a meaning to express what he/she wants the mss to be - I don't find any good reason why getsockopt() should return the same value. 
   At least two reasons makes me belive this is an error:
	 1. The user program can always remember what value he passed to setsockopt(), if any. Besides of that any system call , including getsockopt()should take longer than a in-memory access in user space.
	2. Other implementations of TCP/IP protocol notably SunOS) return correct value. See the source code at the end of this email of a small test application that has been used to verify this assumption.
     IMHO getsockopt() should return the value of mss_cache variable. Enclosed is a patch that should modify the kernel in this matter.

  As promised here it is the source code of the test application that helped me to detect the above bug. The program has been tested on several Linux machines including:  
	2.2.14-12smp /i686
	2.2.16-3 /alpha
