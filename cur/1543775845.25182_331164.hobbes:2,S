Journaling implies filesystem consistency, not data integrity, AFAIK.

Ext3 has stronger guaranties than basic filesystem consistency.
I.e. in ordered mode, file data is always written before metadata, so
the worst that could happen is a growing file's new data is written
but the metadata isn't updated before a power failure... so the new
writes wouldn't be seen afterwards.  You should try the same test w/
ext3 in "writeback" mode and see if it fares better or worse in terms
of file corruption.
