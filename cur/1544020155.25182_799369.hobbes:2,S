Hi Bhavesh,
What's the callchain that can result in intel_iommu_domain_alloc
being called? It looks like most possible callsites are checking
intel_iommu_found, which will be 0 since we check dmar_disabled before
calling init_dmars to enumerate the iommus.
(I'm looking at 2.6.28.y right now, is there an interim between when you
 stumbled upon this two weeks ago and git head where it's no longer an
 issue? I guess it probably got missed due to folks travelling for LCA.)
regards, Kyle
