Using this as an argument against plug-ins is a bit strange.  I suppose 
somebody could go overboard and use plug-ins to implement a subKernel.  
Would this then imply that plug-ins are wrong?

The unix philosophy would hold with plug-ins, as this would aid flexibility.  
Using plug-ins is a form of modularization, much like the 'one tool should 
do one thing' approach.

Nothing wrong with that, unless you have an allergy against explorer.

Now that's a great example for using a plug-in in the wright place.

This is really the crux of the issue.  Introducing plug-ins into the FS is 
really the wrong place, when we already have an abstracted VFS that allows 
this to be fanned out to its children.
Thanks!
