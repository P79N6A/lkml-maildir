Andi has a nice patch in the suse kernel which adds heuristics to disable
apic on systems where it isn't likely to work.  It DTRT in at least
one problem case that I know of.   The actual fall-out from enabling
'run SMP kernels on UP i686' for FC6 has mostly been a non-event.
Literally a handful of cases, that will likely all get caught and worked
around by Andi's patch or similar.
