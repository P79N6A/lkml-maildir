yeah - we default to PREEMPT_BKL on plain SMP kernels, so it's enabled 
on the majority of enterprise distros and it's working pretty well in 
practice.
even today there are a couple of bad BKL latencies still: Lee mentioned 
ioctls and reiser3 - neither has been fixed since i wrote 
CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL two years ago. Turning the BKL into a semaphore does 
not reduce BKL latencies itself, but it makes all _other_ workloads 
schedule sanely and without delay. With PREEMPT_BKL disabled (which 
turns on the big kernel spinlock again) any big BKL delay is immediately 
felt by other tasks too, because we waste that CPU time spinning on the 
big kernel spinlock.
