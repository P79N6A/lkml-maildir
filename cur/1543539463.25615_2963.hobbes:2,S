From what I see, there are two reasons that this patch should be used.
1) It's against the ATA specs (as our vocal friend likes to point out that
he votes for)
2) It protects against an ignorant root from totally destroying his HD.
So, although there are thousands of ways to destroy your computer on
purpose, it should be difficult (one could wish, impossible) to do it
because of an accident.
Is it absolutely vital to have it release in 2.4.0 or could it wait until
that gets released and be added while development for the next version
begins?
