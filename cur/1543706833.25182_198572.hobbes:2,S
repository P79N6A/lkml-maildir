As anybody who's chased a 'null pointer dereference' OOPS, plenty of
stuff in the kernel DOESN'T check for null.  And this is a *style*
document, not a calling conventions document (unless we're documenting
the use of kmalloc/kfree as well as layout?
If we're doing that, we may well want to expand it slightly to cover
the case of 2 kmallocs, a 'goto out1' and 'goto out2' to demonstrate
proper unwinding/freeing....
