Subject: [PATCH] Separate CLONE_PARENT and CLONE_THREAD behavior
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Several versions back you added code that forces CLONE_PARENT behavior
whenever CLONE_THREAD is specified.  This unnecesarily forces a particular
multi-threading model at the application level, and in fact breaks some
ways of doing multi-threading.
In particular, it requires that at least one task in an application *not*
be part of the thread group, and that the pid returned by the original
fork() can not be the thread group id itself.
It would still be entirely possible to code an application or threading
library in the way you envision by specifying CLONE_PARENT and CLONE_THREAD
together.  However, there's no good reason for forcing this model.
A patch to remove that restriction is below.
