Dave,
Thanks for the pointer to tpctl (ThinkPad configuration tools for Linux).
It allowed me to change the default speed so I get 300 MHz at boot.

)
Using tpctl I was able to figure out that the key sequene FN+F11 can 
be used to toggle power mode (the F11 key has faucet icon :-).
With my CPU at full speed a couple of other problems that I was having
have gone away.  I was having problems with keyboard focus when I 
switch X term windows and sometime X clients would get broken pipe
errors when starting up.
Thanks,
PEK
