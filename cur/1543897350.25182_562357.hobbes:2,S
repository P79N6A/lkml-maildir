Ah, thanks for the hint!
BTW, in this case, how the fragment is aligned to the newly given
samples?  Since the stream is running, and apps may feed the new
samples at any time.  Especially when it uses a small double-buffer
(two short fragments), the wake-up timing is tight, and may introduce
another underrun soon again.
