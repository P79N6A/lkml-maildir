the problem is this code in printk:
        if (oops_in_progress) {
                /* If a crash is occurring, make sure we can't deadlock */
                spin_lock_init(&logbuf_lock);
                /* And make sure that we print immediately */
                init_MUTEX(&console_sem);
        }
so two crashes on two separate CPUs can go on in parallel. The problem
is not constrained to the serial line - i've seen it on VGA too (albeit
there it's much more rare).
