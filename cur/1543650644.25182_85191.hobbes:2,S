It's huge because it moves a lot of files around:
  1. drivers/char/agp/ -> drivers/video/agp/
  2. drivers/char/drm/ -> drivers/video/drm/
  3. console related files in drivers/video/ -> drivers/video/console/
(1) and (2) should be reverted, but apparently they aren't reverted in the
patch at 
http://phoenix.infradead.org/~jsimmons/fbdev.diff.gz
 yet. The patch
also seems to remove some drivers. Haven't checked the bk repo yet.
James, can you please fix that (and the .Config files)?

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
