You have insufficient basis upon which to claim I would write code as 
broken as above.

Of course you have to consume the I/O space to push the level to 0. 
 What do you think I am, stupid?
This is done with something like:
for (;;) {
     fd = event_wait(...);
     while (do_io(fd) != EAGAIN);
}
Trying to do at once as much work as one can on a given fd helps keep 
that fd's context information in cache.  If one needs to have the fd 
yield the CPU in order to reduce system latency, one generates a 
user-mode event.
