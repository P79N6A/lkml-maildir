Hm, I got recently hands on a hardware where 2.6.21-rc1 based
kernels from Fedora rawhide simply do not boot as there is no
way to get to disks.  I would not mind some change in behavior
although so far I can boot at least some earlier kernels.
This looks like ATIIXP issue and details are here:

Changelogs for kernels in question have this:
* Wed Feb 21 2007 Dave Jones <davej@redhat.com>
- 2.6.21-rc1
