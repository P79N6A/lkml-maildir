Subject: smb shares reconnection if remote computer goes down ?

	If think the subject says it all. As windows machines tend to get
rebootet very often, its some kind of problem to me because the shares dont
get automatically re-connected agian. If i were the only user, no problem. But
we have multi-user here and access to shares is needed often. Maybe its just
an option i missed ? 
ANy help would be very appriciated
