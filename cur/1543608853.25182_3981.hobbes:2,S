Ah, that might make the difference.  It looks like the number of
endpoints is different on this device, than any other 4.x Clie devices
(they should have 4 bulk endpoints.)  The older devices have 2 endpoints
(endpoints are usually done in hardware)
This Clie is reporting to the driver that it _does_ have 2 "ports" (a
port is 2 endpoint pairs in this scheme), but in reality, it doesn't.
The lying device is then causing the driver to oops when it tries to
write to a port that isn't even there.
I'm going to have to rework the driver to fix this problem, give me a
day or so to come up with a solution.  Are you willing to try a patch
when I have something?
Thanks for the good error reporting, it really helped.
