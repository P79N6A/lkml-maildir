Subject: [PATCH] interface checking ARP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

After the discussions in the "ARP (mis)behavior" thread I decided to go
ahead and try to change the ARP behavior.  It was easier than I expected,
this patch forces ARP requests to be ignored unless they are received on an
interface configured to the target IP.  I'd be interested to hear if this
creates any problems - it seems to work well for me.
