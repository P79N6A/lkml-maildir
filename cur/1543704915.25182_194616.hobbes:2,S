While appreciating your offer, I'd like to remind that this works
  perfectly prior to the 20031203 ACPI patch. Indeed, this is what
  2.6.1 vanilla says in that area:
cpufreq: CPU0 - ACPI performance management activated.
cpufreq: *P0: 1800 MHz, 0 mW, 250 uS
cpufreq:  P1: 1200 MHz, 0 mW, 250 uS
Attaching the gzipped dmesg for my 2.6.1 boot - let me know if
  you want anyway dmidecode output and DSDT; for this latter I'll
  have to ask for instructions (or is the output of a simple
  'cat /proc/acpi/dsdt' enough ?).
