I don't understand: 2.4 would only have the feature of 2.3, just bug fixes and
that way, no? I have no idea of the problems to solve (and I belive it could),
but would it be possible to include some partial work (the part which works) under
2.3 to able people to try it (I now 
http://people.redhat.com/dledford/linux_kernel.html
and 
http://members.tripod.com/jason_hartman/linux/
 but as they are for old
kernels revisions, that's not so easy to try them on recents kernels)?
Please, don't cc to me: I am on the list...
