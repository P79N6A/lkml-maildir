I ended up doing even more.
For me, running lmbench with this, it seems to improve some things by up 
to 20% (pipe bandwidth and latency, small file delete), some other things 
by 10% (larger file delete), and others not at all.
Still, that 20% is _huge_. 
HOWEVER. I didn't compare very strictly. I should have done many more runs 
(I only did three), and more importantly, I should have compared the exact 
same kernel (I compared the new results against a kernel that was a couple 
of weeks old, so there were other differences). So it's a bit suspect. 
Finally, it might depend on the core a lot, and other cores might not get 
the same results.
So somebody should do a much better test. I'm too lazy.
