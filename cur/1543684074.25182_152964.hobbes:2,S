Isn't this whole "problem" solved if you do your hobbies in your own 
free time? Of course, then you should also NOT use any IP from your 
employer then.
If the employer agrees that you do it partly in company time, then you 
should work out some agreement on GPL-ing it if you want to submit it 
for inclusion.
Regrds,
