Hello,
I'm currently using Linux 2.2.10 running on Cyrix 6x86's and Intel PII's
to hold virtual server accounts. Each machine typically holds 60 accounts,
which consists of 60 Apache webservers, 60 crond, 60 atd, 60 syslogd,
several mysql servers and any number of telnet and ftp sessions.
Now this generally runs quite smoothly however I've noticed that when
the virtual memory usage rises above 110Mb, syslogd will exit with a
SIGTERM and this happens regularly. Running syslogd under gdb suggests
that it occurs within the select() syscall 
I was wondering whether it could be caused by a resource limit somewhere
but I couldn't find any appropriate ones. Otherwise what's the best
way to go about debugging this sort of problem considering it's a live
system ?
Regards,
Nick.
