there should be no 'virtualization' overhead, and what
do you want to account for, if not by a group of tasks?
maybe I'm missing the grouping condition here, but I
assume you assign tasks to the accounting containers
note: network isolation is not supposed to add overhead
compared to the host system (at least not measureable
overhead)
