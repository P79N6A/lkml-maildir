I have already done the sense_buffer mod on 2.2.10-ac7
and from my first check into the SCSI sub-system drivers
only one needs a change because of it. [I am too
embarrassed to mention which one that is :-)]. So far so
good.

If a transfer count is good enough for CAM-3 it should
be good enough for us. [I prefer an absolute count
(defaulting to 0 for low level drivers that don't
support it) while the rest of the world prefers a
residual count. I will go with the majority on this
point.]

CAM-3 Working draft, rev 3 16-Mar-98
page 144 section 11.8.1 in 
typedef struct ccb_scsiio3 {
   ...
   CAM_I32 cam_resid;
   ...
} CCB_SCSIIO3;
 - cam_resid
   The data residual length member contains the difference
   in twos complement form of the number of data bytes 
   transferred by the HA for the SCSI command compared
   with the number of bytes requested by the CCB cam_dxfer_len
   member. ...
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Both Doug Ledford (aic7xxx) and Bob Frey (advansys) have
indicated that they can provide this number. On the
application side, Joerg Schilling (cdrecord), Monty
(cdparanoia) and David Mostang (sane) would like to
know this number.
