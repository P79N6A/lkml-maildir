As said before, it can be bounced :)
You have support for streams, someone could read the inherent information
and write it to the stream. At the risk of these two streams being
unsynced temporarily, requiring some syncer.

There is no nice standard way of finding MP3s by the ID information.
find music/ -name *mp3/..metas/id3/ | xargs grep -i "dream theater"
or something. Which reveals the metadata to find. 
The kernel doesn't have to parse the ID3 tags, that can be handled in 
userspace by a daemon, updated based on mtimes or somesuch, yes?

Sure, when someone goes through every application from ls to nautilus
and rams a tool-based patch down the app maintainer's throat and then
we're still dependent on the filesystem layout, which is easier to break
than the filesystem itself :)

So they should be implemented for samba and other guys can come up with
alternative means for using them ;)
