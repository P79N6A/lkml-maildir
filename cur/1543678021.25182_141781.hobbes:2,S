Not quite. A class represents a class of devices, or the function that a 
device performs, e.g. disk or sound.

No. If you want to go that far, 'devices' could go under there as well, 
and we'd eventually just have one top-level directory: /sys/class :) 
The top-level directories in sysfs represent classes of objects, not 
necessarily tied to any driver model concepts. The reason it's so 
driver-model heavy now is because that's how the whole thing originated.
