I dunno about the rest of the people around here but I for one do not know
what kcopyd does, nor why it is being added to the kernel.  The changelog
was your chance to enlighten us - it is a shame nobody took the five
minutes to prepare a description.

What is the page pool for?  It is unfortunate that there is no suitable
library code for managing this - it is a fairly common pattern.  Maybe we
could massage mempools in some manner.
Why are the pooled pages locked?

Do these lists need to be initialised a second time?

Structure assignments are nice.  If the struct is small the compiler will
do an element-by-element copy.  At some compiler-determined breakpoint it
will do a memcpy.  And it's typesafe.
