this is hardly a thread for lkml as you're posting about out out-of-tree driver. 
  This issue has also been fixed in 7.4.35 which was released last week on 
e1000.sf.net. In the future, please post this stuff to 
e1000-devel@lists.sourceforge.net where we discuss the out-of-tree driver.
Cheers,
Auke
