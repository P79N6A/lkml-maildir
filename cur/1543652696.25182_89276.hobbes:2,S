Sorry, I've been feeding Linus (and lkml) slowly.  It's not permenant,
I promise 8) I discussed the issue with Greg Kroah-Hartman and have
sent him a patch for examination.  In the new method, external code
doesn't know about kernel datastructures.

The question is whether to force an /sbin/hotplug change to use the
module alias mechanism, or generate the modules.*map files at "make
modules_install" time to avoid breakage.  I'm leaning towards #2, but
I haven't written it yet (should be simple).
0.7 has preliminary /etc/modprobe.conf support, but it only does
primitive aliases not options as yet.  That's next on my list for
userspace, along with "modprobe -r".

Thanks for the feedback,
Rusty.
