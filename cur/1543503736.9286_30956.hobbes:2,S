a "real" FX processor can do real-time flanging with a 0.2ms
delay. the idea that linux (or beos) for that matter can step into
this kind of role is absurd, or close to it.

i think (but don't know) that you're wrong. quasimodo does a lot
(arguably all) of what you are talking about, and it works the way i
describe. if you are in a tight loop reading from the ADC, processing,
and then writing to the DAC, the timing i describe is exactly what you
want.
>"Average latency" and "maximum latency" are two very different things.
no - latency and jitter are two different things. what we have a
problem with is jitter, not latency. the difference is subtle but its
important because it affects how you think about solving it.

be sure to get it from CVS. i'm spending a lot of time right now
working on tightening down the screws on the real-time FX processing
loop.
