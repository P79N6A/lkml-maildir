Actually, there is quite a bit of interest already in the same circles
that are using RT preempt.  "How do I get a timer with better than 1ms
resolution" is an FAQ on linux-audio-dev, and once you have dynamic tick
the next logical step is high res timers.
Currently we refer these users to George's site.  I suspect the only
reason there has not been more interest is that not many users are up to
integrating the HRT and the RT preempt patch.
