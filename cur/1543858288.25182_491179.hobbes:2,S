Subject: [PATCH] CONFIG_VM_EVENT_COUNTER comment decrustify
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/13/185

From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
The VM event counters, enabled by CONFIG_VM_EVENT_COUNTERS,
which provides VM event counters in /proc/vmstat, has become
more essential to non-EMBEDDED kernel configurations than they
were in the past.  Comments in the code and the Kconfig configuration
explanation were stale, downplaying their role excessively.
Refresh those comments to correctly reflect the current role of
VM event counters.

Christoph and Andrew (I sure hope) understand what's the truth
here better than I.  I trust they won't hesitate to refine,
hack, mutilate, ignore or extend this patch, as appropriate.
