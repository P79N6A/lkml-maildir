Hi Adam,
I don't really ``only'' check for 0xc1, it just shows which bits I'm
interested in (0xc1 is a mask anded with the status).
In fact, I'm only interested in the error bit (ERR), but saw what you did
and decided to stay as close to 0xc7 and 0xcb, both of whom are in the 
subset of status & 0xC1, (0xC1 == BSY|DRDY|ERR). So in effect 0xC7 and 0xCB
still match.
Anyway, if you are throwing away
	if (command->status & 0xC1)
then you might as well throw away flags 0x11 from tw_sense_table[]
and then we're back at ``square 1'' -- this is exactly when the
driver gets into an inf. loop and eventually locks up the machine
and the serial console prints ... 
3w-xxxx: scsiX: Command failed:	status = 0xc1, flags = 0x11, unit #Y.
... ad infinitum.
I was just trying to avoid this deadlock.
