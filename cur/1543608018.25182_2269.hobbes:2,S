For what it's worth - I've had a very similar oops ages ago. Back then it
was blamed on bad RAM, but ever since then I've run numerous memtest's
over it without finding anything and never had any problems later either.
See here:

Call Trace is very similar. Maybe it's just coincidence, but who knows.
Regards,
Udo.
