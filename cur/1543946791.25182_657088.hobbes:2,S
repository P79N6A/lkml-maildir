Subject: [PATCH 0/3] kgdb: fixes and ARCH=arm support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are 3 more patches against the kgdb-light.  Porting kgdb-light to
another arch has found 2 regressions, which are fixed in the first patch.
The second patch adds hooks for an additional kgdboc uart driver which
was required to complete the testing with real hardware.
The third patch adds the ARCH=arm support for kgdb-light.
For initial merge of kgdb-light targeted at 2.6.26, the first patch in
this series is required.  The other patches are there for further
community review and to show the effort of integrating kgdb into
another arch with the API provided in the kgdb-light patch series.
Jason.
