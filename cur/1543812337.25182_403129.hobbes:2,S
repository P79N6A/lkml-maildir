That's not a problem. It's a ringbuffer. It doesn't need an atomic
snapshot of the reading and writing pointers together. Nothing breaks
if a reader advances the read pointer while a writer is holding a
local copy of it, or vice versa. The only thing we have to guard
against is the result of an individual read operation being corrupted
by a parallel write.
So what's better in that case? Should we change these from atomic to
spinlocked or not?

Actually, we won't. The IFNULL* macros were not only printing a message,
but also taking evasive action in order to avoid dereferencing the NULL
pointer. To achieve the same with WARN_ON() would require four lines of
code for each occurrence, which IMHO is too much code clutter for a class
of bugs which should be largely eradicated by now anyway.

That's understood and will be fixed. I was just wondering whether your
remark in parentheses was prompted by any particular sparse warnings you
wanted us to fix and which for some reason we hadn't seen?

Thanks muchly for that very lucid explanation. I see much clearer now
in that area! :-)
