Yes. I think that's exactly what Alexander was talking about.

Of course the network can't drop the lock from there without breaking the
rest ;).
>(snmp counters etc.). I will convert them to cpu local vars in one hit,
Good idea, so you'll avoid the lock and you'll have to do the sum (without
locks too) only at /proc read time.

So also NR_CPUS .data and "maybe" each one starting cacheline aligned,
right? ;). Yes looks like a good idea and would save lots of memory as
everybody is enlarging his structures to go cacheline aligned. Then we
could remove all the ugly stuff like the aligned_data union in sched.c...
