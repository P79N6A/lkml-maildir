Since you apparently have this hardware,
I'm going to hijack your attention for a second

How good it it? Signal strength/sensitivity?
Does driver/fw/hw survive prolonged packet flood testing?
I'm asking because so far I never saw 11g hw which does.
I tried prism54 and acx111. Is ipw2000 worth buying?
