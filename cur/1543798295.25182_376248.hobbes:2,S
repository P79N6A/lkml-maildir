Yes, we have plans for that. The keys managed by the key retention
service have a description field that can be used to uniquely identify
keys and allows searching for specific keys. For this first version of
the code, we are using simply "mmc:key" as the description, which does
not allow more than one MMC password to be stored at a time.
Probably using the entire 128-bit CID for the key description would
waste too much space though, so we are thinking about using just some
CID fields to build a smaller unique ID. The key retention service has
quotas for how much space a keyring can use for payload and key
description, so we should try to keep the description as short as
possible. If a collision occurs and the password is wrong, we can
simply invalidate the key and ask for the password again.

I actually just did the following change to the OMAP code (drivers/mmc/omap.c):
-
-	block_size = 1 << data->blksz_bits;
+	/*  password protection: we need to send the exact block size to the
+	 *  card (password + 2), not a 2-exponent. */
+	if (req->cmd->opcode == MMC_LOCK_UNLOCK)
+		block_size = data->sg[0].length;
+	else
+		block_size = 1 << data->blksz_bits;
Given that for the LOCK_UNLOCK command the sg_len will always be 1, we
can get the block size directly from the first entry of the
scatterlist. For other block operations, the blksz_bits value is used
as usual.
Maybe removing blksz_bits and using the block size directly would be
better? Is there any host/card which expects to always receive a
power-of-2 block size for block operations?
