Okay.  I will do this sometime this weekend.  I'm currently in the
middle of a business trip which makes testing a new patch difficult.

Right.  If you look at the comments added to the code, the PCI APIs always
prefer direct config space access over using the PCI BIOS.  The Linux
direct access methods only perform 32 bit cycles for 32bit API calls.
The ony time Linux will use the PCIBIOS (which may do everything as
32bit accesses) is if the direct access method fails.  So, the machines
where direct access doesn't work can't be supported by the old, manual,
CMD640 code anyway.  On machines that have working direct access, using
the PCI APIs is equivalent to the old method with the added bonus that
you don't blindly attempt to perform an access type that the chipset
does not support.  This was the root cause of the "CMD640 driver performs
drive by shootings of other devices" issue.

Okay.
