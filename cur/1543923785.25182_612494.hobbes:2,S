drivers/media/video/bt8xx/bttv-cards.c calls ip_compute_csum().
However, when CONFIG_NET=n, that produces:
ERROR: "ip_compute_csum" [drivers/media/video/bt8xx/bttv.ko] undefined!
Config symbol VIDEO_BT848 can be made to depend on NET, or the
osprey_eeprom() function can be built depending on some new config
symbol, or bttv could have its own checksum function...
.config attached.
