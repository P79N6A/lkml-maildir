FYI - another quirky Quanta motherboard from HP, with DMI readings 
reported to me.

Using port80.c, I could hard lock a HP Pavilion tx1000 laptop on the
first go. This was with ubuntu hardy's stock kernel (a 2.6.24-rc)

Tonight, I will try compiling a kernel with these values added to your patch.
Some history, feel free to ignore if it's not relevant: ubuntu
feisty's 2.6.22 based kernel worked fine, irc. We were having issues
with sound, so tried fedora8's .23 based kernel, but this would
sporadically hard lock. Ubuntu hardy's 2.6.24 appeared fine, for the 2
hours or so I used it last night, until using the port80.c program,
obviously.
Cheers,
Joel
