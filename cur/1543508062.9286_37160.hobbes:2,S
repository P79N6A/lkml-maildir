I perhaps should clarify this.  In fact, a big raison d'être for
Genesis is that, since it *isn't* a full-blown Linux kernel, it keeps
the life-link to the BIOS until it has gathered up enough pieces to
make sure the system can pull itself up.
So, the (long-term) idea behind Genesis is exactly this.  There is a
lot of code to be written between here and there; I hadn't quite
planned to make this as public so soon.
