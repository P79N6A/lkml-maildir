Could you send me the source code diff between the two versions
you tested?  2kB difference is way too much, the asm version should
be smaller if anything.

No.  The only real difference between the *(volatile *)& version
and the volatile asm() version is that the volatile asm() version
has defined semantics.  There will be some code generation differences
too, but they should be in the noise, unless GCC generates really
bad code for either case.  We know it sometimes does that for the
*(volatile *)& thing; if the asm() version does something bad, I'd
like to know about that too.
