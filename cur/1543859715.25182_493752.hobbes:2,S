I'm not confident about what you mean.
Something like this?
  - __make_request() sets fs_end_io() to req->end_io()
  - The driver calls blk_complete_io()
       * if it succeeds, the request is done
       * if it fails, the request is not completed
         and the driver needs retry or something
  - Current users of req->end_io() have to update/rewrite thier end_io.
  - Features like mine will set its own end_io.
    It checks error and decides whether calling fs_end_io() or not.
Depending on drivers, there are some functions called between
__end_that_request_first() and end_that_request_last().
For example:
  - add_disk_randomness()
  - blk_queue_end_tag()
  - floppy_off()
So they might prevent such generalization.
In addition to the suggested approach, what do you think about
adding a new flag to req->cmd_flags which lets the end_io() handler
not to return bio to upper layer?
It will be useful for multipathing and can be done even within
the current __end_that_request_first().
For example,
static int __end_that_request_first()
{
	.....
	error = 0;
	if (end_io_error(uptodate))
		error = !uptodate ? -EIO : uptodate;
	.....
	if (error && (req->cmd_flags & "NEW_FLAG"))
		return 0; /* Tell the driver to call end_that_request_last() */
	total_types = bio_nbytes = 0;
	while ((bio = req->bio) != NULL) {
		..... /* process of finishing bios */
	}
	.....
}
