Hi,
Is there a way of changing the value of MAX_ORDER
using CONFIG_FORCE_MAX_ZOMEORDER? During 'make xconfig'
I did not see a way. If I change it by hand in .config
and then run make oldconfig, it gets changed back to
the old value (== 18). The source version is 2.6.6
And, if it matters here -- I am on ia64. 
Thanks
Sourav
