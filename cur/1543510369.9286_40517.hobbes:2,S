Looks safe enough.  wakeup_bdflush() doesn't need to run the disk task
queue: the bdflush() code will do that itself just before going to
sleep, and if bdflush blocks internally on get_request_wait (the only
place where I think we can stall in a manner which might give us
deadlock), then we do an automatic run_task_queue(&tq_disk) before
waiting on the on the request wait queue.
