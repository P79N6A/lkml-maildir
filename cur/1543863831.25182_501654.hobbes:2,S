   Good point! Of late I've been working on single-user systems, so it
   was not at the front of my brain, despite years of building and using
   multi-user systems.
   It's a point that multi-user systems have struggled with forever (when
   somebody inserts a CR in the drive mounted in the system box, which user do
   you pop up a media player for?).
sed s/user X's screensaver/suspend to disk/g <<EOF
   I tend to think it's not a kernel-vs-user-space issue, though. To
   solve it you need, somewhere, a notion of a "user session" and you
   need some way to separate system-level issues (like low-battery) from
   user-level issues (like activiating user X's screensaver).
EOF
Are you sure?
best,
