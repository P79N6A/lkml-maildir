Buy a machine?  Why not use UML?
  
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/
umlbuilder can build Redhat 8.0 images (along with loads of others)
  
http://umlbuilder.sourceforge.net/

There are debian root filing systems on the UML site.
Alternatively use the image created by umlbuilder and chroot into it.
Mount --bind your source directory and away you go...
