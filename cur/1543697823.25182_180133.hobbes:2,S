Nothing ever hits the disk (In interrupt handler - not syncing ...), 
that's the reason why I had to install kmsgdump in the first place.
(Sidenote: a few days ago, I had the intent to install the lkcd kernel 
patches, but gave up because of the time required to 
patch/compile/install/setup correctly the kernel and userspace utilities 
(not .deb of lkcd-utils available...)).
I suppose I could enlarge the kernel message log size, but the kmsgdup 
documentation states:
---------------------------------
If you have changed your messages buffer size (which is 16 kB by 
default), you should modify the size in "include/asm/kmsgdump.h", 
parameter LOG_BUF_LEN. Some people required 32 kB. But you shouldn't 
exceed 60 kB since the dump is done in real mode (16 bits).
For kernel versions 2.5.6x and later, the LOG_BUF_LEN parameter is part
of the kernel .config file (LOG_BUF_SHIFT) so you don't need to modify
it at all.
---------------------------------
...so I you think 60kB would be enough to catch the first oops -- or if 
the doc is outdated -- I can try this...
