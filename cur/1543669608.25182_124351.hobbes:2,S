Doug,
I completly agree with what you said. One can write a user-space 
tool to create/re-create/update device node and try to keep device
names consistent. I am sure people (Greg KH) are working on this.
All I am trying to do is, come out with a plan to do this for 2.6.
We can do all the user-space stuff and make generic dynamic
<major, minor> assignment and some how make the /dev/ nodes
magically everytime rmmod/insmod or re-boot. There are lots
of dependencies and players here. All these going to happen for 2.6 ?
I would love to see this happen. But please, don't leave it in
the middle. (leaving the device node mapping to user/admin).
And also, how do we deal with booting/running 2.4 ?
If not, my patch is a fallback solution.
Thanks,
Badari
