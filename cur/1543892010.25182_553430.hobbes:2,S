I had already sorted out the PRD, but I couldn't convince myself that
the pad stuff wasn't used, so for pata_icside I had:
static int pata_icside_port_start(struct ata_port *ap)
{
        /* No PRD to alloc */
        return ata_pad_alloc(ap, ap->dev);
}
Therefore, I can just arrange for this to do nothing and just return
zero.  A similar fix for pata_platform should probably also be in order
as well.
