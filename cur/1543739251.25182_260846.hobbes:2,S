Please don't.  Current names may be odd, but at least they are
sufficiently different from one another.  4 names that only differ in
a single number are an invitation for typos, thinkos and similar
confusion.
Whenever I notice a mess like that in any piece of software I change
it to make the difference bigger, not smaller.  Have you ever been
slightly distracted, kept typing anyway and it compiled just fine,
creating a subtle bug? ;)
