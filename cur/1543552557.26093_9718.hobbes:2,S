-You will need at least gcc 2.7.2 to compile the kernel.  You currently

+The gcc version requirements may vary depending on the type of CPU in your

+The recommended compiler for the kernel is egcs 1.1.2 (gcc 2.91.66), and it
+should be used when you need absolute stability. You may use gcc 2.95.2
+instead if you wish, although it may cause problems. Later versions of gcc
+have not received much testing for Linux kernel compilation, and there are
+almost certainly bugs (mainly, but not exclusively, in the kernel) that
+will need to be fixed in order to use these compilers. In any case, using
+pgcc instead of egcs or plain gcc is just asking for trouble.
+
+Note that gcc 2.7.2.3 is no longer a supported kernel compiler. The kernel
+no longer works around bugs in gcc 2.7.2.3 and, in fact, will refuse to
+be compiled with it.
 
 In addition, please pay attention to compiler optimization.  Anything
 greater than -O2 may not be wise.  Similarly, if you choose to use gcc-2.95

 COMPILING the kernel:
 
- - Make sure you have gcc-2.7.2 or newer available.  It seems older gcc
-   versions can have problems compiling newer versions of Linux.  This
-   is mainly because the older compilers can only generate "a.out"-format
-   executables.  As of Linux 2.1.0, the kernel must be compiled as an
-   "ELF" binary.  If you upgrade your compiler, remember to get the new
-   binutils package too (for as/ld/nm and company).
+ - Make sure you have gcc-2.91.66 (egcs-1.1.2) available.  gcc 2.95.2 may
+   also work but is not as safe, and *gcc 2.7.2.3 is no longer supported*.
+   Also remember to upgrade your binutils package (for as/ld/nm and company)
+   if necessary. For more information, refer to ./Documentation/Changes.
 
    Please note that you can still run a.out user programs with this
    kernel.
