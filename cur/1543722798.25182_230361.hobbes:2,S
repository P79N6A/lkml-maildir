Hi, I'm running Gentoo Linux on an x86 Laptop [Compaq Presario].  I've
been running 2.4.26, 2.6.6-rc3 and 2.6.7 for a while [well 2.6.7 ever
since it came out].
Now just recently I've been getting error [see attached dmesg log]. 
XFree doesn't report any errors it just shuts down [yeah helpful!].
Previously X did work in 2.6.7 so I don't think this is a build failure
[perhaps gentoo messed up something?].  My XF86Config-4 file has not
changed recently either.  Has anyone else experienced this problem
before and more importantly ever solve it?
So far I've tried rebuilding the kernel and X in case one of their
files were foobarred to no avail...
ARRG!  ;-(
Tom
