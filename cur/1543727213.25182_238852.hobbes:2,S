The previous posting related to false negatives obtained by 'cscope'. This posting relates
to false positives from the same cause (can't parse pointer-to-function declarations):
From arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:
    621 int request_irq(unsigned int irq,
    622                 irqreturn_t (*handler)(int, void *, struct pt_regs *),
    623                 unsigned long irqflags,
    624                 const char * devname,
    625                 void *dev_id)
$ /usr/bin/cscope -d -p9 -L -3 setup_irq
...
arch/i386/kernel/irq.c irqreturn_t 660 retval = setup_irq(irq, action);
...
There is obviously no function called 'irqreturn_t'.
