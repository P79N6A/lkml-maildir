	Because it is the only game in town currently.  Nothing else works
well enough.  Yet.  Like I said, give it a year or two.

	Sure.  But the ease with which one can produce a working 
prototype of an NGOS has never been anywhere close to as asy as it is 
these days with all the open source code floating around, which makes 
this a completely new ballgame.

	Right again.  What will happen is that there will continue to be 
a shakeout in the NGOS field, and one or two of the designs will absorb 
the good features of the others and come out on top.  If they proive 
clear and present benefits, they will be used as long as porting apps is 
not that difficult.

	It certainly is impressive that a 25+ year old design is still
kicking.  But all it is is adequate, not outstanding or anything like
that.  Unix has a number of serious defects: 
* Lack of generalized message passing
* Lack of a decent privilege/capability model
* Blocking I/O
* Interruptible system calls
* Process-based instead of interrupt-based
we can (and will) do much better than Unix in the future.
