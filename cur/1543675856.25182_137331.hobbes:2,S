Doug:
I've tried that, but it doesn't make any difference.
I've been able to do ficticious tweaks on /dev/hdc and hdd like, for 
example, activating dma mode 5 -which is virually impossible for a 
cdrom drive. Actually, as I'd disabled ide/atapi-cdrom support in the 
kernel I guess that /dev/hdc & hdd point to 'nowhere'. Anyway, with 
hdparm optimizations or without them processor time consumption remains 
at a 70 - 90 % so, clearly, I haven't made any progress.
The only interface for cdrom drives that i've enabled in the kernel is 
scsi (to be able to record and rip w/ cdrdao). I guess that the 
inability to use dma is related to that because my ide hard disks seem 
to be using it w/o problems (and obviously I'm not using scsi with 
them). Nevertheless, I can't set up a multcount higher than 8, which is 
really surprising because the ide chipset and the drives are quite new.
So I repeat my enquiry, Is all this a question configuration or of a 
kernel upgrade? I've already tried the latter, but, as far as I could 
appreciate, the current nvidia 'accelerated' drivers (1.0-4363) for my 
geforce2 didn't work with the 2.5 kernel (more precisely 2.5.69) I'd 
compiled. Once more, is this incompatibility a current issue of these 
kernels? In case it were an configuration error I would certainly do 
the upgrade because 2.5 kernel series seem to have many advantages, as 
for example, the inclusion of the alsa sound drivers.
