Hi Ray,
This issue has actually been resolved, see the patch at:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/16/149
[ We've slightly altered the locking scheme, but it's also good to know
that converting hci_notifier to a blocking notifier doesn't cause any
troubles either. If this is fine with other drivers too, this could actually
be a separate patch. ]
I'll also soon send that patch to Andrew, will Cc you too.
Thanks,
Satyam
