I agree that _if_ there is a "BITWRAP" then it should be long, but I 
don't see the reason for it to be in bitops.h when it is only input.h 
that uses it. + I find it different with BIT since it works as well with 
'char' as 'long'.
Also, I think it would be best if the name indicated it is a 'long'.
Am a little bit curious why you would like it in bitops.h, but won't 
complain if you do (think you have noticed my view of it ;))
