   Except for few rather esoteric things like searching for capabilities
or manual control of power management states, the whole old API works
in the !CONFIG_PCI case.

   Well, if I look at usage of the API in the drivers, I immediately see
that almost all drivers using any PCI API are PCI-only drivers which
are not even compiled in if CONFIG_PCI is turned off. Hence the pci_*
stubs or ifdefs apply only to the few existing drivers which support
the same device on different busses.
   On the other hand, all functions would become dead, are marked as
either __devinit or __devexit, so that they will end up as init code
or even thrown away if the driver is compiled without CONFIG_HOTPLUG
(which is very likely in the !CONFIG_PCI case). So the code size increase
is probably harmless.
				Have a nice fortnight
