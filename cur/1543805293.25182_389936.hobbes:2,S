You just want the device naming to reflect that. The user should not
need to use /dev/hda, but /dev/cdrecorder or whatever. A real user would
likely be using k3b or something graphical though, and just click on his
Hitachi/Plextor/whatever burner. Perhaps some fancy udev rules could
help do this dynamically even.
If you are using cdrecord on the command line, you are by definition an
advanced user and know how to find out where that writer is.
