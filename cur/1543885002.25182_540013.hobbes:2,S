Hi,
I'm presently rather puzzled, if this is really a kernel bug, its a big bug. 
Summary: The system ramdisk (initrd) gets corrupted while running mkfs.ext2 on 
a local sata disk partition.
Reproduced on kernel versions: vanilla 2.6.16 - 2.6.20 (<2.6.16 doesn't run on 
any of the systems I can do tests with).
Please note: I could reproduce this on serveral systems, all of them use ECC 
memory and the memory of most of them the memory is monitored using EDAC. 
Details:
1.) Our systems boot from an initrd, all system services are running from the 
initrd/ramdisk.
2.) While setting up a lustre meta data storage server, lustre runs 
mkfs.ext2 -j -b 4096 -F -i 4096 -J size=400 -I 512 /dev/sda4
(Please note, I first observed this while using a lustre patched kernel, but I 
could reproduce this with vanilla kernels).
While this mkfs.ext2 command was running, suddenly running commands such as 
ps, top, ls, etc. resulted in segmentation faults.
To see whats going on, I copied the entire / (so the initrd) into a tmpfs 
root, chrooted into it, also bind mounted the main / into this chroot and 
compared several times /bin of chroot/bin and the bind-mounted /bin while the 
mkfs.ext2 command was running.
beo-05:/# diff -r /bin /oldroot/bin/
beo-05:/# diff -r /bin /oldroot/bin/
beo-05:/# diff -r /bin /oldroot/bin/
Binary files /bin/sleep and /oldroot/bin/sleep differ
beo-05:/# diff -r /bin /oldroot/bin/
Binary files /bin/bsd-csh and /oldroot/bin/bsd-csh differ
Binary files /bin/cat and /oldroot/bin/cat differ
...
Also tested different schedulers, at least happens with deadline and 
anticipatory.
The corruption does NOT happen on running the mkfs command on /dev/sda1, but 
happens with sda2, sda3 and sda3. Also doesn't happen with extended 
partitions of sda1.
Any idea whats going on?
Thanks,
Bernd
