yeah.  Plus your heavy-dd-to-/dev/sda tends to block light-writers to
/dev/sda in perhaps disproportionate ways.
This is on my list of things to look at.  Hah.

It's rather complex, I believe.   Needs per-backing-dev dirty counts (already
in -mm) plus, I suspect, per-process dirty counts (possibly derivable from
per-task-io-accounting) plus some tricky logic to make all that work along
with global dirtiness (and later per-node dirtiness!) while meeting all the
constraints which that logic must satisfy.
