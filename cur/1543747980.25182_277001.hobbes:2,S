If the write calls are accessing different
tty instances there is no interaction
between the write calls.

I don't see that there is anything for the driver
to recover from. The driver sees a series of
write method calls and blocks, processes, or
rejects them as appropriate.

The driver should not require anything from the caller
after the write method has returned. The driver waking
a caller is a service *to* the caller *if*
the caller is interested (on a wait queue).
The only purpose of the schedule() call is for the
caller to temporarily yield execution while waiting
on write_wait. If the caller doesn't care, such as when
the driver indicates all data accepted, then there
is no reason to call schedule(). In this case, the
break is hit and the caller removes itself from the wait queue.

The write_wait queue wakes code blocked in the write path
due to a component (ldisc, driver, etc) being busy
so it can try again. It is not an indication that a particular
write call completed successfully.
It is a write throttling mechanism. When a waiting
process is woken, there is no guarantee that *all*
components in the write path are ready for more data.
The process must observe return codes and wait
again if so indicated.
Short of a major rewrite of the tty code,
this behavior will be stable.
