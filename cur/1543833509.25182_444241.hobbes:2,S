Take it as a rhetorical question reflecting my lack of details about this 
issue.

Yes this is also protecting the shared array. It is invalid to use 
free_block on elements of the shared array. It is valid to use free block 
on per cpu arrays since they are protected only by interrupt disable. It 
also valid to use free_block on alien caches because they have their own 
lock.
