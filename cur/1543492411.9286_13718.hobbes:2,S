no it isn't !
that bit isn't a setuid *root* bit at all if the owner of the file isn't
root.
anybody should still be able to set that bit if he want. the capability 
you mean is the chown/grp capability.
*don't* change the meaning of the setuid bit please.
you can however remove root if there is somwhere a database of personal
capabilities per user (ala passwd, shadow, etc...), then by setting
setuid to
any user, a binary could get a subset (or all) of *that* users 
capabilities and no more.
