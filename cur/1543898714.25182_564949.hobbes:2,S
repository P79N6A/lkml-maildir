Sorry, but you're mistaken.
Some ARM platforms also use the suspend code in kernel/power and the 52xx
powerpc too (BTW, I don't know of any ARM platforms that support suspend and
don't use it).

There are not many drivers in the tree supporting that right now.

So perhaps we should modify them first and we can drop the freezer?
Perhaps we can schedule the freezer removal (from the suspend code path), so
that people have the time to rework the driver midlayers to take that into
account?
