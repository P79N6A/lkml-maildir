	Thanks for the information.  If I understand you correctly,
you are saying that Linus's current 2.5 tree (2.5.7-pre1) has the
new driver from 2.4, albeit one that does not compile.
	Diffing the 2.4.18 and 2.5.6 versions of NCR53C8x.c and
fdomain.c, they look the same, aside from some io_request_lock's
replaced by scsi_host->host_lock.  dtc.c appears to have a few
minor changes, which I assume are for 2.5.  So, it looks like
the NCR53C80 drivers in 2.5.7-pre1 are approximately the correct
starting point for generating working NCR53C80 drivers in 2.5 (as
opposed to recopying them from 2.4).  Please correct me if I am wrong.
