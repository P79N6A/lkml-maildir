I'd first of all need a better understanding of what these comments are
really based upon:
/* On some platforms relocations to global data cannot go into read-only
   sections, so 'const' makes no sense and even causes compile failures
   with some compilers. */
While I can see such behavior as reasonable for, say, shared objects,
I severely doubt that this is generally appropriate for executables, not
to say for the kernel. This is particularly in the light of this comment in
gcc/output.h:
  /* To optimize loading of shared programs, define following subsections
     of data section:
which clearly says that the resulting (default) object placement (of read-
only data in writeable sections) is an optimization, not a requirement,
and even then only for shared programs (which the kernel clearly isn't).
Has there been any communication with the gcc folks on this subject?
