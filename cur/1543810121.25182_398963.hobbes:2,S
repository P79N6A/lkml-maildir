yes, acceptable.
once, again, believe me, this is very required feature for 
troubleshouting and management (as Eric likes to take about maintanance :) )

why? any reason?

this doesn't help to create migratable sub-pidspaces.
for example, will you share IPCs in your pid parent and child pspaces?
if yes, then it won't be migratable;
if no, then you need to create fully isolated spaces to the end and 
again you end up with a question, why nested pspaces are required at all?

SURE! :)

required.

No. This is required.
Because, container can be limited with some resource limitations. You 
may be unable to enter inside. For example, if container forked() many 
threads up to its limit, you won't be able to enter it.

agreed. irrelevant.

it is not only about OpenVz. This is about manageability.
This is the feature our users like _very_ much, when administrator can 
fix the problems. Have you ever tried to fix broken VM in VMWare/Xen?
On the other hand, VPID approach can fully isolate containers if needed 
for security reasons.
