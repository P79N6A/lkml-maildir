I know relatively little about PCI, so I'll leave this for someone else 
to answer. I'm just looking to find an acceptable solution which will 
allow these VIA SATA users to be able to boot again...

Yep, forgot to update/remove it after the original patch.

Sounds sensible, but has the disadvantage that we'd be running on all 
future VIA hardware, even if they fixed it. The original quirk code also 
has this issue, but it could be argued that the current ID list does not.
That said, I'm happy to write and test a new patch with your 
suggestions, if it would be acceptable to Greg/Jeff.
