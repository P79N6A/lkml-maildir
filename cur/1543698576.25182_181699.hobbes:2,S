That is normal and intended. You should see some "dma disabled" messages in your kernel-log (unless if you haven't enabled "DMA only for disks"). ATAPI/cdrom does not work reliable with DMA on 2.4. I think Andre Hedrick has switched that off after 2.4.20.
If you really want ide-scsi with dma you should try 2.6.
This is how it should like:
SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
hdb: attached ide-scsi driver.
hdb: DMA disabled		<------
hdd: attached ide-scsi driver.
hdd: DMA disabled		<------
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
  Vendor: COMPAQ    Model: CD-ROM LTN485     Rev: KQA4
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
  Vendor: HP        Model: CD-Writer+ 9100b  Rev: 1.06
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
So you should disable that option in your config or if you prefer using hdparm try it with "-d0 /dev/cdrom".
