Total red herring. AGAIN.
The paravirt_ops isn't a 1:1 hypervisor ABI.
If we change paravirt_ops to be higher-level ops (as we should), yes, the 
paravirt->VMI layer needs to be extended to have the "higher->lower" 
translation. But at no point did we break the hypervisor.
Anyway, please don't even bother cc'ing or replying to me any more.
