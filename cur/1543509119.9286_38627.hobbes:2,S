Subject: [PATCH] ESS1869 fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch makes my ESS1869 card (in a Compaq Armada 1500c notebook) play
at the right speed. It is against 2.3.18. It fixes what looks like a typo
in the source code - the switch statement appears twice, once with the
1869 line commented out. If it isn't commented out, sound plays really
slowly.
