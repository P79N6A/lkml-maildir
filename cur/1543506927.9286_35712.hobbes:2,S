BTW I see no rules to translate/masquerade this address in your setup,
so that it is difficult to understand your question.
Generally, ARP requests are sent with "source" address of the packet which
hits wire, (provided you did not break kernel with some of patches floating
here). Do you see? It is translated by definition.
