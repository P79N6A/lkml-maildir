What would be nice in the case of drivers that don't use the new error
handling code is to add something like:
#warning "Uses obsolete SCSI error code, see Documentation/2.5/scsi-error.txt"
for a hint as to the reason why it no longer compiles, and a short guide
on how to update the drivers.
The same would be good for Jens' changes - his document could be put into
2.5/bio.txt or something, so any currently out-of-kernel coders can find it.
Cheers, Andreas
