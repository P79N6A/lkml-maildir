In the interfaces definitely yes and all subsystems should have their
own lock_kernel calls, but why in the old drivers? For those it's very
unlikely they are used on any SMP system anyways (e.g. anything
depending on CONFIG_ISA) or if they do only on 2 CPU systems.
Of course if you can find someone to do the work it wouldn't be
bad, just wouldn't seem like a particularly useful investment of time to
me.
Also it would be bad if the people who did such conversions didn't
actually test it and that's a great danger with many old drivers because
nearly nobody has the hardware (and if they do it won't be in a SMP system)
