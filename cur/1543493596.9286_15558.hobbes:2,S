Sorry, but this does not correspond to what I am seeing on said Windows NT
machine.  On Windows NT, I have the same directory and the same file in
that directory marked read-only.  If I do an rmdir /s/q on said directory,
it gets removed (even if it contains files marked read-only).  I believe
the smbfs implementation is incorrect in this respect assuming the
functionality of "rmdir /s/q" on Windows NT an be equated with that of "rm
-rf" on Linux when dealing with the same directory (one local, one
shared).
Mike.
