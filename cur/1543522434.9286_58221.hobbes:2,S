I've got one of these. We don't support the wavetable, its not ideal as it
has only one dsp

Lots of dsp channels, but you need ALSA or a very recent kernel. Excellent
card for the money

Similar sort of spec to the trident but uglier hardware and a more stable
driver

Two dsp channels (often enough - one for esd one for mpg123) works ok.
The trident is IMHO a very nice card, fairly open docs too.
