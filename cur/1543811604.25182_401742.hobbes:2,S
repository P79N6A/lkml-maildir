I don't :-(
An earlier version used local variables instead of one within the 
task_delay_info
struct but we moved to using a var within to save on stack space in 
critical paths.

Would keeping the timespec vars on the stacks of the functions being 
accounted be too
expensive vs. keeping bunches of vars within task_delay_info to deal 
with the nesting ?
Unfortunately, the need for accuracy also means the variables needed are 
timespecs and
not something smaller.
