Yes, it's two entire cans.  The problem is that in *both* cases, we're probably
going to have to do an API change.  It may be preferable to only require changes
on the userspace side once, rather than change it once to fix the inheritance
problems in 2.7/2.6.N+10 or whatever it will be, and then again in 2.9/2.6.N+20
or whatever....

A new PF flag strikes me as marginally better, especially if we have a way to
propogate from Elf headers in a way similar to Execshield's use of elf_ex.e_phnum
to set the executable-stack...
