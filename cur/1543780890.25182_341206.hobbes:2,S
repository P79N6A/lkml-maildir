If whatever I do will go wrong you'll see it very fast. Then you can't receive 
data ;)

This should be rather simple. Just use their kernel sources, copy the files 
from a newer kernel in and rebuild the module.

Yes, if you find some which have a driver that smells less it would be a good 
idea to use them.

*g* I'll remind you ;)
