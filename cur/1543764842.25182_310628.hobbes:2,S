Since you mention NTFS, there is no need to worry about that for Linux.
Certainly the Linux kernel NTFS driver is never going to create 8.3
short names.  (It doesn't create names at all at the moment but my grand
plan is that it will only ever create file names in the Win32 and/or
POSIX name spaces.  The DOS name space is a thing of the past IMO.)
