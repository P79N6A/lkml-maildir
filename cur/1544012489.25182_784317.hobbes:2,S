Even with this and your driver patch applied, the tree
doesn't build successfully:
cc1: warnings being treated as errors
arch/sparc/kernel/psycho_common.c: In function ‘psycho_check_stc_error’:
arch/sparc/kernel/psycho_common.c:104: warning: format ‘%016lx’ expects type ‘long unsigned int’, but argument 4 has type ‘long long unsigned int’
Did you remove sparc's -Werror when doing test builds
of these changes? :-)
Either way these need some work before they should be
added to any tree.
Andrew you probably want to toss these from your tree
since at a minimum they will break the sparc64 build.
Sam will fix them up and resubmit, and I'll apply them,
don't worry. :)
