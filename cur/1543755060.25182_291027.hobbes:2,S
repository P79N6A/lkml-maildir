You're right. I forgot that serio isn't anymore tied to the driver and
can cease to exist on its own asynchronously. However, I'm still not
sure whether it's worth it. We might as well simply drop the unregister
call in i8042_open for AUX completely and forget about asynchronous
unregisters and use normal refcounting. As far as grep knows, it's the
only user.
