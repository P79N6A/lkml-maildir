Too inefficient, and impose too many limitations on the filesystem
(which sets up some filesystem structures based on the blocksize).
Already, 1kB block size is too small for many things, and 4kB is
preferred.  It would probably support larger blocksizes already on
ia32 if the page size was larger.
