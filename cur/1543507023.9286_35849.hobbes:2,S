Mike Galbraith had the wisdom to write:

Are you sure there are no connections active when memleak
reports this? (I have to try memleak myself, does anybody
have a pointer/URL to it?)
The memory allocated in accept.c:99 should be released at
misc.c:129 as soon as the connection is finished.
I'll investigate this further though.
