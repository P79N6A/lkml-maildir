Whatever. It just looked a bit weird. :)

I can't give you a tcpdump right now, but here are my ipchains rules:
ipchains -P forward DENY
ipchains -A forward -s 10.66.66.0/24 -j MASQ
Actually I have a firewall,  but I tried removing it all but the
problem persists.
I'll send a tcpdump as soon as I can make you one. :P
