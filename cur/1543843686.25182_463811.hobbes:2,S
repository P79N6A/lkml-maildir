Hi,
I fixed the technical issues pointed earlier (one code path was not locked 
correctly while the other was more restrictive than necessary about what
modules could be loaded/unloaded when tracing is active) and moved to Relay and
DebugFS. I also found a corner case where DebugFS keeps a stalled dentry if a
process in using the directory when deleted : I think this fix should be
considered for merging.
