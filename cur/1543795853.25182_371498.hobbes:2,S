Well, you're asking me to write all the points from the documentation
in advance. Not tonight (or look up the full thread in the l-k archives,
I think I covered most) 
But right now gettimeofday or clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) is
probably your best option. It tries to be reasonable fast depending 
on hardware capabilities (and when you measure on P4 
even basic RDTSC is quite slow). At least on x86-64 gettimeofday
isn't a real system call, but actually often stays in ring 3.
If you want to measure instructions in cycles in the future you can probably 
use RDPMC 0, but that's not implemented yet. It won't be a replacement
for a timer for other purposes.
