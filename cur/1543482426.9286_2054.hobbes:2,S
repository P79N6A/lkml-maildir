You should see the horror-script I have to use to check things out from GNOME
anonymous CVS.  CVS appears to have a *lot* of problems with submodules,
especially when sticky tags are involved but sometimes with ordinary HEAD
checkouts.  Ugh.  Of course, if we don't use submodules then it won't be a
problem... but I can think of a few things that might want to be submodules.
(ISDN?)
I suggest we move to something sensible instead of CVS.  Please.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
