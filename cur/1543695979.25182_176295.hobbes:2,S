Yes. The crash happens inside the BIOS itself, and the kernel doesn't 
really have any control over it. The most Adam could possibly do is to 
avoid calling the BIOS (or at least avoid _certain_ calls), but that would 
require knowing what it is that triggers it.
Has PnP support ever worked for you on this board? Sometimes the solution 
is to just say "it's dead, Jim", and just not enable it. There are few 
enough systems that actually want PnP.
Adam, any ideas?
