Hello,
        I need to catch a signal within a 2.2 kernel module.
Can this be done?
        Specifically, I'm writing a driver that allows the
user to read or write the Intel MSRs.  I have this part of
my module working.  However, when a user tries to read or 
write an unsupported MSR, the Intel Pentium II returns with a GP(0).
This causes my module to die with a SEGV. 
        How can I catch this signal within my module?  I have
the Linux Device Drivers book, but it doesn't
appear to cover this type of problem.   
Thanks in advance. 
Regards,
Steve
