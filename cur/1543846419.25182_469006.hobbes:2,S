Hi,
Hit by 
http://bugzilla.scratchbox.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=279
 I
wondered why such
a change that could break existing setups entered 2.6.18.
Now I can peek through '/proc/<pid of process outside chroot env w/ my
UID>/root' into the
box's root (and that's why scratchbox is broken now).
Regards,
Koos
