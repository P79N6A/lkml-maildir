Just wanted to add a "me too" to this. 
I too am having trouble w/ APM suspend/resume with 2.6.0-testX on my TP
T20. I've narrowed it down to the 3c59x PCMCIA card I'm using. If the
card is present in the system when it suspends, the system will not
properly resume (disk fails to spin up all the way). Without the 3c59x
card, the system will suspend and resume properly. 2.4 works like a
charm. 
config and dmesg can be found in osdl bug #1569.
