It's a little bit of both. :-) Initially it was written to help me with 
implementing and testing the integrity provider.  But it could definitely stand
on it's own.  As Serge Hallyn commented 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/13/220,
 by 
adding the mmap hook, IBAC could replace the LSM aspect of digsig and a gpg 
based integrity provider, could be written, instead of EVM, which is TPM based.

I guess I was a bit over zealous in preventing IBAC from running 
unintentionally.  Will fix in the next IBAC patch release.

In order to verify the metadata integrity, an xattr needs to be
specified on the integrity_verify_metadata() call.  As IBAC does not
define an xattr of its own, I used this one, which at the time worked. 
But as EVM is only one integrity provider, this probably is not a good 
idea. To resolve this problem, I guess the integrity_verify_metadata()
API call should respond without requiring an actual xattr.

You really don't want to prevent kernel threads from working. Nasty things
happen.

FAIL here indicates that the integrity of the metadata was bad, while
NOLABEL indicates, in the case of EVM, that there was no HMAC.  I'll
update the error message to differentiate between the two.

Same as above.

For integrity_verify_data(), EVM verifies that the file hash matches the
one stored as an xattr.

For integrity_measure(), EVM calls IMA, if enabled, to extend the
measurement list with the hash value it provides. In most cases, EVM
has already calculated the hash value, when it was called to verify the
data. integrity_measure() is not meant to be intrusive, so it is defined
as void.
