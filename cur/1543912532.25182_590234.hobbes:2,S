Subject: [RFC][PATCH] detect & print stack overruns at oops time
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/31/28

In thinking about the 4KSTACKS + STACKOVERFLOW problems, I thought
about this - if an oops occurs, explicitly print whether the current
esp is now overrunning the stack, whether the thread has ever overrun
the stack, else print the max stack excursion for the oopsing thread,
if DEBUG_STACK_USAGE is enabled.
1) maybe printing the info for a non-blown stack is not useful..
2) current esp past end of stack can already be deduced, but this
   makes it more plain...
3) if the initialization of end_of_stack is problematic for
   any reason, it could be removed and the "did we ever overrun"
   test could be moved under the DEBUG_STACK_USAGE ifdef
Thoughts?  This is a separate problem from the piggy dump_stack()
path, but it seems to me it might be useful in looking at stack-related
oopses when they do occur.  With this change, it seems feasible
to turn off DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW, turn on DEBUG_STACK_USAGE, and just
get the bad news when it's actually happened.  :) 
Thanks,
-Eric
