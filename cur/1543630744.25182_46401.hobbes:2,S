Hi,
As Arek Miskiewicz reported to me, the previous NTFS TNG versions didn't
compile with CONFIG_HIGHMEM. The compilation failed due to lack of the
definition of the KM_BIO_IRQ used in the NTFS code.
In this release KM_BIO_IRQ was added to km_type enum on all platforms
supporting it (sparc, ppm, i386).
If you don't use HIGHMEM support or use other architecture the changes
don't touch you.
The patch is available as always from the linux-ntfs project's page:
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/downloads.html
As usually big thanks to Anton.
