I believe by design it is a kernel thread, unkillable even by -KILL
signal (precisely because of NFS root setups). You are right,
it does not matter how do you send -KILL from shell: via kill,
killall, killall5, etc... It simply should be ignored by rpciod.
And it is ignored in 2.4. In 2.6, rpciod becomes non-functional
(NFS reads return -EIO) for a second or two, then it returns
back to normal.
Hope this clears up the confusion.
(BTW, I planned to temporarily work around this by inserting
"sleep 3" right after killall5, but, hehe, reading /bin/sleep
via NFS, of course, did not work also :)
