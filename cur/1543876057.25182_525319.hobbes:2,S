as discussed in earlier thread there are two kinds of users of BIT
1. input sybsystem which needs the "% BITS_PER_LONG"
2. & all other who don't, so that they are warned when the bit no overflows
I think a simple macro cant serve both the purposes
so IMHO there should be two macros
 +#define BIT(nr)	(1UL << (nr))
which server the first case
&
 +#define XXXBITXXX(nr)	(1UL << ((nr) % BITS_PER_LONG))
for input users
earlier i suggested a name BITWRAP
but some people hate it i think
'm fine with any other name as well
inputs....suggest a name
so that we can still keep these two macros (along with LLBIT) in
bitops.h & use apporpriately
only hassle is the whole input tree is to be searched & replaced for BIT
is this OK
