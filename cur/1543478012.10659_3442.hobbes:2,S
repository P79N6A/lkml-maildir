Yes, I suppose that is needed. Let's skip "Information Highway"
though, please!

Hopefully that will be an option left for hackers only.
386 support cuts into performance and SMP support.

I'm not kidding. We must acknowledge the trademark correctly.

Not stupid, we now have characterset and font support for it.

Ugh. Yes, it crossed my mind but didn't seem to fit anywhere.

The organization breaks down without bullets. The list of features
would pretty much have to go.

No, UNIX is a legacy operating system. UNIX is hard to use.
UNIX might even be dead. Linux is new, exciting, and trendy!
Linux even has more server market share than UNIX. :-)

Yes, good.

Ouch, you are right.

That won't do either, since it might just mean TCP/IP.
How about "hard disks" or "hard drives"?

Yes, good idea.

I don't think so. Press releases almost always put background
information at the end. The news goes up front.

Biographical info seems to be part of most press releases that mention
a person. It makes the person seem real, human, and likeable.
I don't know what you mean by your comment about "native to".
The location could be changed to something less specific like
"Silicon Valley", but surely Linus Torvalds has an unlisted number.
My second sentence is a bit pathetic, but something like it would
be very good to have. It crushes the "freeware is junk" idea and
reduces suspicion of our motives. It is important to showcase the
quality. Normal companies simply can't claim that their employees
passionately care about the code. Anyone have replacement text?
