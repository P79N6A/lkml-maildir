Ok, I'll introduce it in libfs.c first then.

Right, that has been one of the areas I've been thinking about
myself without coming to a good solution. One alternative I
thought about is to have the news members as part of file_system_type
itself, but that would cost a bit of memory for every single 
file system, and might lead to unintended misuse of these members
by non-simple file systems.
Do you think it would be better to dynamically allocate the
file_system_type and have a pointer in struct simple_fs_type to
it?
