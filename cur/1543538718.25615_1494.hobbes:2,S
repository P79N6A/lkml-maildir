Yes. My memory is bad, so I just looked at it again,
and indeed, /dev/funkey is a possibility.
Looking at the discussion I see that I reacted once already:

Right now I had precisely the same objections: these keyboards
have CD player buttons, and Power management buttons, and
Browser buttons, etc. With a /dev/funkey one cannot have
the cdplay program open /dev/funkey, one needs a separate funkeyd.
But perhaps that is the right approach.
We were just reminded that there is also traffic in the opposite
direction: keys must be enabled, and LEDs set.
