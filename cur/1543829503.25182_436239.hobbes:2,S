No - there's code on the horizon which wants to use a few and so I did this
clean-up exercise to indicate which ones should be used and which ones
shouldn't.  It's no problem delaying the actual exports until they're
specifically requested, but I would at least like to move the definitions
into include/linux so people know they are welcome to use them if they wish.
