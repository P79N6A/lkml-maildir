To implement this at the ftrace level should be a trivial change. I'm just 
saying that doing this at the "ring buffer" level might be a bit more 
complex. The ring buffer has no idea of ftrace. It should not. It is at 
a lower lever than ftrace. Although, I do think some of the protecting 
that is done at the tracing level during resize should be moved down into 
the ring buffer layer.
