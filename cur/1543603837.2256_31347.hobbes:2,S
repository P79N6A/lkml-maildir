So - for example if you have 500 processes, each process 8k stack (plus
one page for vmalloc alignment). Please tell me some alloc/free strategy
that fills up and fragments 64M vmalloc space.
You can't find it.
The difference between memory and vmalloc space is this: you fill up the
whole memory with cache => memory fragments. You don't fill up the whole
vmalloc space with anything => vmalloc space doesn't fragment.
