Subject: ps/2 mouse problem with KVM switch

Hello!
Kernel 2.6.2, XFree86 4.3.0
I am using a Logitech MouseMan 2xOptical mouse connected trough a KVM 
switch.
By default the mouse is detected as "ImExPS/2 Logitech Explorer Mouse".
The problem is that the mouse doesn't work. It is too slow and no mouse 
clicks work. If I move it very fast I sometimes get a random click event.
I specify psmouse.proto=bare mouse works OK, but not the wheel :(
(I have seen at least one "lost synchronization").
Specifying psmouse.proto=imps or exps doesn't help.
Without the KVM switch all is ok (as much as I tested under 2.6.0).
Under 2.4 mouse works perfectly, wheel and all.
I am using /dev/input/mice under XF86 (kernel does complain about X 
using direct hardware for keyboard and gives a bunch of errors).
GPM shows the same behavior if I run it (I'm not using it).
What else can I do?
Regards,
MArk
