You want more resources in a context where no such thing exists,
in interrupt processing context.  There the stack is limited, allocatable
memory is limited, etc. etc. etc.  And all of this is because you cannot
sleep in interrupt context.
Resources are fixed in this environment exactly becuase one cannot
sleep or wait on events.  It's supposed to be fast processing, deferring
more involved work to process context.
