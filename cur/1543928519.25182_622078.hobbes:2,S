I'm sorry to reply to myself, but I think I actually had this backwards.  The
fact that the 8259 does not get reported as being routed through the ioapic,
means that in disable_IO_APIC during a crash shutdown, we do _not_ go into
virtual wire mode.  Instead we simply disable the LVT0 on the ioapic (which as I
understand it from above is the  timer interrupt), and we trust the 8259 to
route the interrupt to the appropriate cpu.  If the 8259 is hardwired to deliver
interrupts to cpu0 only, then we do in fact need to switch processors during
shutdown.  Perhaps what we need to do is detect if the 8259 is not routed
through the ioapic on shutdown, and if it is, only them implement my patch to
jump to the bsp.
Thoughts?
