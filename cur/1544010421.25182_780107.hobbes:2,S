I actually have these in my queue, but I'm up in the
mountains snowboarding until Sunday so have only been
handling the most important fixes and easy patches.
Andrew, don't fret, I'll take care of these and they
won't get lost.
If it's cc:'d to netdev, there is next to zero chance
of the patch not getting either rejected or applied
since we track everything in patchwork.
You know, you too could look there for the state of
these misdn patches :-)
