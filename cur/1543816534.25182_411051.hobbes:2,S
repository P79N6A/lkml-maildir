I see, so for now you import the key from the keyring into the 
superblock at mount time, but in the future you will directly use the 
key from the keyring as needed?

Isn't that what adding the salt is for?  You add 16 bits of salt so that 
a pre hashed dictionary would require 65,536 different hashes per 
passphrase permutation.  That places more computation burden on 
generating such a dictionary, but more importantly it places a large 
storage burden on the dictionary.
Recursively hashing only places greater computation on the creation of 
the dictionary, which is of no consequence as the dictionary only has to 
be created once.  If you want to fight dictionary attacks, you should 
add a longer salt rather than recursively hash.  Taking the salt from 16 
bits to 32 bits also requires the attacker to compute 65,536 times more 
hashes per passphrase permutation at dictionary creation time, but ALSO 
requires that they store 65,536 times more hashed values in the dictionary.
Another thought that crossed my mind is that it is likely possible to 
factor the recursive hash function and simplify it such that it can be 
computed almost as quickly as the single hash rather than taking 65,536 
times longer.
