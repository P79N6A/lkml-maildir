I have a radeon card here.  Just tried it.  The X server starts up OK but as
soon as I run tuxracer, some ioctl down in the radeon driver keeps on timing
out waiting for the FIFO, spins for ten milliseconds in-kernel and the X
server immediately calls the ioctl again.  The whole thing is bust.  I went
all the way back to 2.5.39, where it is still bust.  2.4.21-pre5 is OK
though.
So it looks like my breakage is different from yours.
Could you please try just 2.5.64 plus
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.5/2.5.64/2.5.64-mm6/broken-out/linus.patch
That will tell us if it is a -mm bug or a -linus bug.
It it is the latter, and if you're feeling really keen then could you search through the patches at 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/badari/
and work out exactly which one introduced the problem?
Each of those patches is against 2.5.64.   The chronological order is:
