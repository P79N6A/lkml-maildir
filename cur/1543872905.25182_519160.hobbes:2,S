How about soft-reset, is it possible to reach Device Control Register ?
Seems not. I was thinking about patch to libata which allow to use
Control Register.
In the perfect case i would like to be able to execute vendor command
set (reverse engineered).
Is it possible to control timeouts in user space precisely enough and
get rid of unnecessary kernel error messages without touching
syslogd/klogd?
By the way, how to make libata to not probe some ide channel or drive ?

Could you please send me this patch once it's ready ?
Thank you
