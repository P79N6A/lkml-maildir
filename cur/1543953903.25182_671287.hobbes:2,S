This issue has been resolved for 2.6.26. The fix for this bug is of such a scale
that it could not easily be merged for 2.6.25.

You mean 
http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/phpBB2/index.php?
'ignored' is not the right word, more likely overlooked.
There are quite a lot of messages and I don't always have time to answer them all.
So there is no need to be upset about such thing, simply posting a reminder is usually
enough to make it noticed by me...

What pointer? And rt2400-devel is the mailinglist for rt2x00...
The MAINTAINERS file in the kernel tree indicates 2 mailinglists for rt2x00:
	rt2400-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
	linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org
