There are some really interesting bits in Chapter 1 too...

There's no revocation clause in the license.  They can't.  (SCO would have 
tried to revoke Caldera's license to its contributions it if it were at all 
possible.)

Title 17 chapter 1 section 103(a) seems to lean against this.  I think it says 
that having rights to the collective is conditional on having had the rights 
to the components of that collective.
