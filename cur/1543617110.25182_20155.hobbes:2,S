It would be useful to define the scope and design guidelines of a "real
time task".   Obviously, if it tries to perform filesystem or network
I/O it can block for a long time.  If it acquires VFS locks it can suffer
bad priority inversion.
I have all along assumed that a well-designed RT application would delegate
all these operations to SCHED_OTHER worker processes, probably via shared
memory/shared mappings.  So in the simplest case, you'd have a SCHED_FIFO
task which talks to the hardware, and which has a helper task which reads
and writes stuff from and to disk.  With sufficient buffering and readahead
to cover the worst case IO latencies.
If this is generally workable, then it means that the areas of possible
priority inversion are quite small - basically device driver read/write
functions.  The main remaining area where priority inversion can 
happen is in the page allocator.  I'm experimenting/thinking about giving
non-SCHED_OTHER tasks a modified form of atomic allocation to defeat this.
