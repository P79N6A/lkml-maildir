Do you have KBUILD_OUTPUT set in your environment?
That may explain it since things are running too much in parallel with
KBUILT_OUTPUT set - reported by Keith Owns a few days ago.
I have tried the above on my machine and was not able to reproduce it.
Can you please drop me the output with V=1 so I can see what is
happening. Maybe in private mail if it gets too big.
