  What is really needed is some kind of proper generic hooking setup
that could be used both by LSM and other things.  People doing this
may need to intercept syscalls both on their way to the kernel and 
on the way back to userland (so they can see return codes.)  They may
also need to say whether they want to be first or last if there are
multiple users of this facility.
  But the real question is why the export of sys_call_table was so
gratuitously removed without any kind of replacement being offered.
And the attitude of the developers about it is truly awful. ("Oh, so
we broke the drivers you depend on for your livelihood?  You can just
go get a new job -- pounding sand down a rathole.")
