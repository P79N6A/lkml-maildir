While we're on the subject of framebuffers, one area which needs to be
looked into is the pixel layout for all of:
- little endian byte, little endian pixel
	1bpp: word 0 bit 31..0 = pixel 31..0)
	16bpp: word 0 bit 31..0 = pixel1 bits 15..0 pixel0 bits 15..0) 
- little endian byte, big endian pixel
	1bpp: word 0 bit 31..0 = pixel 24..31, 16..23, 8..15, 0..7)
	16bpp: word 0 bit 31..0 = pixel1 bits 15..0 pixel0 bits 15..0) 
- big endian byte, big endian pixel
	1bpp: word 0 bit 31..0 = pixel 0..31)
	16bpp: word 0 bit 31..0 = pixel0 bits 15..0 pixel1 bits 15..0) 
We currently do not support all these combinations, and so far I haven't
looked into it.  It is on my (great long) to do list.
