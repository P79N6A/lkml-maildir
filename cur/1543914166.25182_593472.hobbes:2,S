Hi Alan,
To be specific I want to call the function 0x60 ,0x61 and few more 
specified in the BBS specification (attached). These functions or alive 
in 16 bit mode (0xf000 segment)
We can call this functions in i386 using the pnpbios driver 
(bioscalls.c). I must call this functions to change the boot order and 
reboot from linux x86_64 using my driver.
I have seen in some forum that we can off the ACPI during the linux boot.
Can you help on this?
