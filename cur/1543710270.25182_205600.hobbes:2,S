I tried 5336 with 2.6.4-rc2-mm1 and it locks the box up completely after 
switching to kdm. It worked with 2.6.3-mm4 previously, now even that 
kernel gets a lock up. I've done a reiserfsck --rebuild-tree which 
repaired some files and left 10 files in /lost+found and I can't 
determine what they are.
I am currently using 2.6.4-rc2-mm1 with the standard SuSE 9.0  Driver "nv".
I also went back to the minion.de release and still got a lockup, I 
guess it's down to some of those files in lost+found that are missing.
Regards
Sid.
