You're right.  Three things are required.
1) Access to cpu_online_map (currently usually intuited from
/proc/cpuinfo)
2) Notification of cpu add/remove (currently via /sbin/hotplug)
3) Minimum size of cpumask_t (currently hardcoded, could be detected by
looping).
Although we don't, in general, know the size of long (think i386 binary
on x86_64), in practice if you always round NR_CPUS up to 64-bits you
can get #3.

In this case, though, the early example programs for setaffinity all
used "unsigned long mask; sys_sched_setaffinity(...&mask,
sizeof(mask))", which was both simple and wrong.  Similarly, getaffinity
users who didn't zero the mask before handing it to the kernel.
Oh well,
Rusty.
