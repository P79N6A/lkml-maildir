I believe it shows clear regression in latest 2.6.25 kernel.

You say it is wrong. Manpages imply otherwise:
       int brk(void *end_data_segment);
...
DESCRIPTION
       brk()  sets  the  end  of  the  data  segment  to  the  value specified  by
       end_data_segment, when that value is reasonable, the system does have enough
       memory and the process does not exceed its max data size (see setrlimit(2)).
...
Note it talks about data segment, not about heap, and that seems to
imply that BSS and heap are actually one area. 2.6.25 broke that.
Now, maybe you are right and heap randomization is useful, but
breaking 10year old executables is no-no. (And you should have posted
man page update, too).
There are ways around this:
1) not enable heap randomization unless app asks for it by personality
syscall
or 
2) (hacky!) detect that app asks for brk() below its heap start, which
means it assumes BSS+heap are contiguous, and just map the memory there.

Yep, will try, sound like a good idea.

Can you quote docs that tells me it is plain wrong? It was plain right
in BSD unix, and in all linuxes up to 2.6.25-git. My man pages still
imply it is right.
Hmm, and even the kernel code implies it is right.

You see? This assumed end_code == start_brk ;-).
