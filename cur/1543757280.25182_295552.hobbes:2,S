Hello,
I have an AMD 64 (gentoo compiled for amd64) and I would like to succeed in my 
video driver installation (ATI Radeon 9250 :-/). I would need the agpgart 
support for the Sis Chipset, but all the entry for agpgart are grayed, I 
can't change anything (Kernel 2.6.9, 2.6.10 ...)
So is it normal or a bug ?? , or am I making a mistake.
NB: one of my friends made the test, without AMD64 and exactly the same kernel 
he can check these options within agpgart...
Thanks,
Marc
