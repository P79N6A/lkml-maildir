The latest support source is in the CVS tree on the HRT site.  It is no 
longer a patch...

I suspect that the 64/32 div resulted in a >32 bit result which is a 
fault.  This was deep in monotonic_clock.  I would rather change to 
clock_monotonic (i.e. xtime+offset+walltomonotonic) and work that code 
patch.  monotonic_clock is just the wrong thing for this work.
