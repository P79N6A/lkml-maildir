Report it to 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/.
 Maybe you'll get help there. 
But "bugs" are _very_ hardware specific, so just a few people will have 
a similar problem and most of this people are just "normal" users -- not 
Linux Kernel developers. The developer (people who are familiar with the 
kernel code and who are maybe able to fix this problem) aren't able to 
reproduce this error and test code to get it working. So they're maybe 
(without knowing anything about the hardware (maybe it's broken 
hardware?)) not able to say something specific about the hardware -- 
they can just guess.
You see it's very difficult to fix such irq problems because some 
factors can cause such an error.
Maybe contacting specific malinglists (e.g. for "broken" pci cards the 
pci mailinglist, etc.), maintainers or developers would be more 
efficient (cc the lkml) and solve your problem (faster), because this 
people are specialists are this type of hardware (e.g. pci).
What hardware is connect through irq 5?
