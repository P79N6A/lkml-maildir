I have to agree with this. There are better ways to determine the license - 
including contacting the author. However, in the lack of any other source of 
information about the license MODULE_LICENSE can be used as a (somewhat) 
defensible position. It'd cost a lot of money and be a very hard fight, 
though - which is one reason why no company would (or should) take the 
chance. Nor should any person, unless they happen to have the money to fight 
the battle.
