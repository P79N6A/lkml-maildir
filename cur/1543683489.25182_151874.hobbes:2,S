my latest scheduler patchset can be found at:
	redhat.com/~mingo/O(1)-scheduler/sched-2.6.0-test1-G6
this version takes a shot at more scheduling fairness - i'd be interested
how it works out for others.
Changes since -G3:
 - fix the timeslice granularity inconsistency found by Con
 - further increase timeslice granularity
 - decrease sleep average interval to 1 second
 - fix starvation detection, increase fairness
Reports, testing feedback and comments are welcome,
	Ingo
