The keep-it-in-user-space arguments seem fairly compelling to me.
Especially as we've pushed whole i/o subsystems out to user space
(iscsi, stgt, talked about fcoe, a lot of dm control, etc).
The functionality seems to align with Doug's sg/lsscsi utility chain
as well.  Granted, the new utility would have to be designed in such
as way that it can incorporate vendor "hardware handlers".  But, if
James has a somewhat common implementation already for a kernel
implementation, I'm sure that can be the starting point for lsscsi.
So, the main question I believe is being asked is:
- Do we need to represent this via the object/sysfs tree or can an
   outside utility be depended upon to show it ?
Note that I am not supporting:
"Vendors may choose to distribute their own applications".
For this to become truly useful, there needs to be a common tool/method
that presents common features in a common manner, regardless of whether
it is in kernel or not.
