Is it possible to extract *just* the E820 memory detect patch from the
2.2.19-pre1 patch? We recently received a bunch of new Intel server
boxes with the STL2 motherboard. However, 2.2.1x refuses to detect more
than 64Megs of RAM; I've heard that this patch fixes that problem. (A
different solution is to upgrade the BIOS to 1.4 (Build 18), but although
the updated Intel docs mention this BIOS revision, it isn't available on
the Intel site.)
Theorectically, I could extract the patched files myself from the breakdown
of the pre-2.2.19-1 patch on linuxhq.com. My main fear would be either
missing something, or including a change relating to something else in the
patch set that subsquently breaks things. And since these boxes have to go
into production relatively quickly, I'd rather not install the complete
pre-2.2.19-7 patch set, if I can avoid it. (The higher ups frown heavily
on anything that doesn't appear to be "production ready".)
I would appreciate any help, either via a list of file patches that I can
extract, or through some pointer to a place where I can download just this
patch.
Thanks.
