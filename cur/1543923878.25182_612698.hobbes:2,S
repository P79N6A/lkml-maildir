  The filesystem mounts just fine on my test machine under latest
kernel tree from git. So, do you still see the problem? What is your
hardware setup? Anything unusual I should be aware of?
  It seems (from the error message) as if we simply read a page full
of zeros from the root directory so it may be also a problem somewhere
else...
