Not at the moment.  I have tried in the past, curious to see if it resolved
the problem - it didn't.
Again, this only seems to happen in the 2.4 kernels (I just read that 2.4.9
has been released, but haven't tried it yet).  2.2.19 is stable when doing this.
Alan, do you have any more thoughts on why this might be happening?
Thanks.
