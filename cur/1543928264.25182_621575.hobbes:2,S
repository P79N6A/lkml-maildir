Scenario - Dell Latitude D820 laptop, tg3 driver says this at boot:
eth0: Tigon3 [partno(BCM5752KFBG) rev 6002 PHY(5752)] (PCI Express) 10/100/1000Base-T Ethernet 00:15:c5:c8:33:4e
eth0: RXcsums[1] LinkChgREG[0] MIirq[0] ASF[0] WireSpeed[1] TSOcap[1]
eth0: dma_rwctrl[76180000] dma_mask[64-bit]
# (lspci; lspci -n) | grep 09
09:00.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM5752 Gigabit Ethernet PCI Express (rev 02)
09:00.0 0200: 14e4:1600 (rev 02)
(I think that's most of the likely-relevant info...)
Issue:
I (for unrelated reasons) run powertop, and it suggests I conserve power
by doing 'ethtool -s eth0 wol d'.  I look at it, and think that it's daft,
because (a) the Dell factory default is WOL disabled and (b) if it wasn't
the default, I'd have *set* it to disabled, and (c) I even went back and
rebooted and checked the BIOS setting - disabled. Nonetheless:
# ethtool eth0 | grep Wake
        Supports Wake-on: g
        Wake-on: g
Is this expected behavior?
