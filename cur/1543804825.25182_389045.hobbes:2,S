FWIW, Mac OS X is one step closer to your vision than the typical
Linux distribution: It has a directory for swapfiles -- /var/vm -- and
it creates new swapfiles there as needed. (It used to be that each
swapfile would be 80MB, but the iMac next to me just has a single 64MB
swapfile, so maybe Mac OS 10.4 does something different now.)
