ia64 has a similar problem, but it's a bit easier because firmware
configures and tells us about the legacy (0-64K) I/O port space.
So we do have to look up the MMIO base where those I/O ports get
mapped, but that's basically the first thing in setup_arch().  We
don't do much before that, so it hasn't been worthwhile to make
the console work earlier.
