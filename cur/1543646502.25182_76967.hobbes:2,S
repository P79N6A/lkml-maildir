The PCMCIA code does initializations in the wrong order, and
asynchronously (ie from multiple different threads). And init_pcmcia_ds()  
really depends on the actual low-level drivers having had time to
register, since the PCMCIA code never had any sane way to inform the DS 
layer that a new client driver had registered. 
Thus the delay by init_pcmcia_ds() - to give time for drivers to 
initialize. And the yenta driver needs some time.. That time apparently 
went up a bit, probably due to the tq/work changes.
The _right_ thing to do is to not have init_pcmcia_ds() depend on 
low-level drivers being initialized, but instead do that DS thing 
_early_, and then when each driver initializes it would tell the DS layer. 
But that's not how the PCMCIA code was organized..
