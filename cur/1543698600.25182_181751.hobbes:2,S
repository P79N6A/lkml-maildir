The changes between 2.4 and 2.6 are huge, for both debug and non-debug. 
Slab with debugging enabled now calls the destructors/constructor on 
every alloc. If page debugging is enabled, then all objects larger than 
128 bytes get their own page and are unmapped after kmem_cache_free(). 
The bio structure is smaller than 128 bytes - that probably explains why 
slab didn't catch the oopses that were mentioned in the other thread.
Perhaps something like the attached patch could help to trigger the 
oops: It increase the size of the bio structures, then they are handled 
by slab debugging.
If it oopses, then call ptrinfo() from the trap handler - it prints the 
name of the cache and the caller of the last slab operation. And hexdump 
the object (after ptrinfo mapped it), it contains a backtrace from the 
kmem_cache_free call.
