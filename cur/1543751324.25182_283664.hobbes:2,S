I wonder what is the status of the poll/select syscalls with procfs:
should work, not tested or unwanted feature?
My tests say that some procfs' files work with select and some don't.
I've read the [1] thread.
This is a real-life issue for some interpretors since users threads may
be implemented with select in order to avoid one user thread blocking
others user threads. Ruby does that.
For example, some Ruby users report [2] [3] [4] that bugs are coming
from bug in procfs-select.
