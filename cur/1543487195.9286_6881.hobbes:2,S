I am doing that.  However, I am currently relying on the external JAZ
drive's terminator for one end of the chain...
Based on your experience, do you think this terminator is not reliable?

So you are saying that the external JAZ drive's own terminator switch is
faulty?  
I am going to buy an actual terminator tommorrow, and turn the Jaz drive's
own terminator off.  Do you really think this is my problem, though?

I have a newer 895.  I will try your new driver tommorrow evening.

After this, I got a kernel panic.  I am running 2.2.2 now, BTW.
Thanks again for your help, Gérard.  I will download the new driver from
tux.org tommorrow and see if changes anything, and I will put a new
terminator on the end of with the JAZ drive.  
If you have any information that may be of help in the meantime, I would
appreciate it if  you would pass it along.
Thanks.
