hi all,
maybe it's just me or something but.. I have since 2.4.20 the following
problem with a fujifilm finepix 1300 camera.
when I switch on the camera :

Jan  5 21:38:25 grobbebol last message repeated 76 times
Jan  5 21:39:24 grobbebol kernel: usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
Jan  5 21:39:24 grobbebol kernel: usb.c: USB device not accepting new
address=9 (error=-110)
Jan  5 21:39:28 grobbebol kernel: usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
Jan  5 21:39:28 grobbebol kernel: usb.c: USB device not accepting new
address=10 (error=-110)
[....]
etc is shown. I am 100% sure 2.4.18 didn't do this. there also is a usb
cam present that works just fine.
anyone who has a tip or maybe a place where to look ? I googled around
but no obvious links.
