Hello all,
I am having RH6.0 with 2.2.5-15.
When I complile the kernel with a patch it all goes fine. At the end the inital ram disk has to be prepared. FOr that mkinitrd is required.
#mkinitrd /boot/initrd-2.2.5-15.img 2.2.5-15
At this point it gives error telling that all the loopback devices are busy!
I have tired using rmmod and modprobe -r but none works to solve it.
What should I do?
