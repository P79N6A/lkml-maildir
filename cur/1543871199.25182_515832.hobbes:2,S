In general I've found once the kernel did something funny on boot that not 
much beyond that could be trusted. However a very small period of alarm with 
lockdep, _assuming it was transient and did not happen later_ as you say, 
would not cause problems.

Ok, but I was very reluctant to release this code as a patch to -rc2 because 
the potential for all sorts of weird and wonderful fireworks and explosions 
from the -pre release makes it a lousy testing ground for something else. 
It's often hard to differentiate breakage in behaviour in the unstable kernel 
or the patch you're applying. I was even somewhat reluctant to be releasing 
this patch for 2.6.20 since people are mumbling (offlist) that they're 
getting weird stalls on that kernel - however they're afraid to report them 
to lkml since their issues are fuzzy and they know they'll be ask to do git 
bisect on an intermittent problem; git bisect as we know is rocket science 
(or brain surgery if you happen to be a rocket scientist).

Which goes back to my original comment about glxgears, only I should have made 
my advice stronger; glxgears should not be used as a benchmarking or test 
tool of any sort period. It displays pretty gears and that's all. On your 
machine, for example, it is not cpu bound from the looks of your description, 
and either loads up the bus or drowns the gpu in ways that delays other gpu 
activity. On other hardware combinations, it does something completely 
different. Given that, it's easy to see how it is impossible to use it as a 
cpu scheduling test of any sort.
