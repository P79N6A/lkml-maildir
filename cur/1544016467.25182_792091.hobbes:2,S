So you're thinking about fdatawrite() being called by some code path
other than ext4_sync_file() before we call fsync()?  Yeah, that could
happen....  I think that will only happen if the file is opened
O_SYNC, but that raises another issue, which is that we're not forcing
a flush for writes when the file is opened O_SYNC.
