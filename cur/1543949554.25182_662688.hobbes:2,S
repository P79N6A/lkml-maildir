What I see may very well be an ide-cd specific problem which is perhaps 
already fixed in Linus' tree.  I need to update and retest.
(In any case, your patch fixes CD writing over SBP-2 and, judging from 
the failure modes I got, is necessary for ide-cd as well.  Or Tejun's 
patch or whatever you guys will come up with.)
