There is another patch in the pipeline to make gettimeofday use
RDTSC in more cases by keeping the offsets per CPU
(this has nothing to do with syncing TSCs which is not possible
in the general case on several platforms) 
I don't think it makes too much sense to hack on pure RDTSC when 
gtod is fast enough -- RDTSC will be always icky and hard to use.
