Hi,
I just compiled 2.4.21-pre1 for a consistency check with all configure options 
set to 'y' and found a file arch/i386/kernel/scx200.c which does not compile 
because of missing support in the Makefile. It is introduced by the 
2.4.21-pre1 patch by Marcelo. 
Is there a reason why it's in the kernel directory of the i386 architecture? 
This is a very unusual place.
I moved it to drivers/char/scx200.c and it compiles like a charme, after 
correcting the Makefiles. Is there any chance of moving it to from the arch 
directory to a more appropriate place? Or did I misunderstand?
I don't know the scx200 Nat Sem chips, I don't have one and I don't even care, 
it's just because I'm doing some thorough build checks on my new -jp kernel 
patch set.
Best regards,
Jörg
