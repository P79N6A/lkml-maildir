I bought this one two weeks ago. The gigaethernet port works well and
I'm using it at 10 Mbps half duplex with the sk98 driver. It has a built
in cable tester, but it's not supported by linux.
The sound card works too, but I had to transplant in my kernel an
updated driver from ALSA CVS. This is annoying because ALSA CVS cannot
easily be compiled standalone for a 2.6. kernel.
There are a few problems (currently being debugged) with the IDE adapter
if you do not use the APIC, be sure to enable it when building the
kernel.
I have no SATA hardware, but I remember reading that the controller is
supported.
