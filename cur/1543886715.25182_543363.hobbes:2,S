Well, if we _do_ decide to do this (is anyone howling?) then we can do
static inline void write_lock_mm(struct mm_struct *mm)
{
	down_write(&mm->mmap_sem);
}
and then let the conversions trickle into the tree in an orderly fashion.
Once we think all the conversions have landed, we rename mmap_sem to
_mmap_sem to avoid any backpedalling.
