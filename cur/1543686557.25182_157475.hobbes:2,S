For 2.4, you're stuck. It needs AGP3 support. The KT400 stuff in
2.4 only works if you shove an AGP2.x gfx card in the slot.
As soon as you put a 3.x capable card in there the chipset changes
mode, and as there's no AGP3 support in 2.4 yet, you're pooched.
The code in 2.6test should work, but before you (or anyone else) asks,
no, it won't work without a bit of bending in 2.4, and I don't have
a backport, or plans to do so any time soon.
Sorry,
