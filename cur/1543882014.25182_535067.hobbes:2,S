For hypervisors which shadow kernel page tables, none of these concerns 
with keeping page tables read-only arise.  However, another set of 
concerns does arise with maintaining shadow synchronization.  One of 
those problems is keeping the hypervisor aware of when pages are being 
used as page tables.
However, it turns out both direct page table and shadow page table 
implementations can be made to use one page table allocation function; 
in the direct page table case (as for Xen), this is the point where page 
tables can be recognized and made read-only.  So this is the dual 
purpose of the paravirt_alloc_p[dt] functions.
