 The reason for such an interface is to be able to do it on top of sysfs
 and so that drivers can implement the same interface on themselfs.
 They just need to export the device's firmware memory as 'data' via a
 class_device of class firmware_class.
 They also need to know when the load starts to set it up and when the
 load finishes to get the device going again with the new firmware, for
 that is 'loading' when they get a '1' they have to get ready for the
 load and when they get a '0' they have to get the device back working.
 Doing that, they would get the hotplug event and compatible hotplug
 support for free. Coping the firmware image in the appropriate
 directory would be the only userspace setup needed.
 Feedback on the interface (data/loading) would also be welcomed, I am
 probably biased by the hardware I have at hand.
 It is currently not possible, but the interface means to allow it.

 That could be done, but I am not sure the complexity is worth it. If a
 privileged user wants to shoot on his foot, he can do so may other
 ways already.

 I think that this is an overkill, the most I can see reasonable is
 forcing an standard header on all firmware images with size/checksum.
 And still I am not sure it is worth it.

 In which way is it not perfect?
 Detailed criticism gives me the chance to try to get things better :)
 Have a nice day
