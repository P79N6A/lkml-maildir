Could be a security issue if the modem gets reconfigured.

Actually I think you can't currently connect a Hayes modem directly
to a serial console, CRTSCTS or no flow control.
With terminal server it may work (especially Linux-based or similar),
for example, with "screen".

Would make sense I think.

I'm not exactly sure what do you mean. First I thought he was
overworked or something like that but now I wonder if I should
check it with an English teacher nearby?
I just really thought he knows modem control lines details and
how Hayes modems behave etc. from BBS era.
What exactly is the "insult" here?
