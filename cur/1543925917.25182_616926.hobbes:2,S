Who would be a good contact at IBM to get some eyes / machine
time on this?

Who would be a good contact at Dell for the same?
I don't have as much experience with oddball firmware from
various vendors as others on this list, but given the rather
stable definition of _SUN in the ACPI spec, I'd be surprised to
see vendors abusing that method. [I fully accept the possibility
that I'm just naive ;)]
More likely, a vendor will do what the HP Proliant folks did,
that being simply omitting a _SUN method altogether.
One more thought on that -- at *worst* my patch series will do no
worse than the status quo of what the acpiphp module is doing
today. That module walks through the namespace looking for _SUN
methods, and when it finds them, it creates an entry in exactly
the same spot (/sys/bus/pci/slots/N) that my patch series does.
What this series adds beyond acpiphp is adding entries for slots
that aren't hotpluggable.

Like I said in an earlier email, HP ia64 systems will require a
kernel change to get this information. Whether it comes via a
generic ACPI access layer like dev_acpi, or something like this
patch series, the kernel will still get touched.
Thanks.
