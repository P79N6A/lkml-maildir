Hi,
Thank you very much for the reply, but i would like to ask some more.
1. it seems we can choose which device we want for console output by 
typing this on kernel command line:
console = device , options
if i type  "console = ttyS1 " is that means kernel will internally link 
/dev/console to /dev/ttyS1 , and when i do any operation to /dev/console 
, it is the same as i do to /dev/ttyS1 ?
2 . what means foreground virtual console as tty0 is representing ?
Regards,
TOM
