I really do believe you about the amount of users. That's probably
because CVS sucks rocks and everyone complaining about it doesn't make
it better. Shut it down and we'll all have a merrier live.
What really makes me mad though is that there's no permanent way to
retrieve and update current kernels at the moment for those who don't
want or cannot use BK. I'm waiting for quite some period to get SVN back
online so I can continue the merging work I've been trying to do. And
yes, I'm one of those fools who are stuck behind a huge 64k
pay-big-bucks-for-the-minute and really have troubles changing back and
forth between several mechanisms to get current versions
(ftp/rsync/CVS/SVN), especially since Linus obviously doesn't release
patches as frequently anymore since he uses BK. :(
