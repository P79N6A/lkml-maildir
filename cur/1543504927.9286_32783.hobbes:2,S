You should be ok.
Off the top of my head, here are my parameters:
/sbin/hdparm -A1 -c1 -d1 -m32 -u1 -W1 -Z /dev/hda
This is on an older Seagate drive and it makes a world of difference.
Make sure you have the appropriate chipset support compiled in.

Real good in my experiences..
The one that bites you in the ass the most is '-u1', but I only saw that
on an anchient '386.
