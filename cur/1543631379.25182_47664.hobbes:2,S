Depends on your definition of "such program". For one, there is :
http://sourceforge.net/projects/minilop/
There is at least one other (older I think) version of readprofile.c
going about as well as my slightly modified version too...
There is also a version that avoids a reboot via a module hack (see
freshmeat), and the previously mentioned module-profiling readprofile
version.
Also see these (incomplete) parts of my howto :
