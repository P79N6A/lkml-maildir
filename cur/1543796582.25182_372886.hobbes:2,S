The kernel has the privileges to trash anything from kernel-space.
This means that an incorrect pointer or length-variable, passed
from user-mode code could trash everything including the kernel
if the kernel code just used memcpy().
So, copy_to/from_user was developed so that the user's privs and
page ownership would be used during the copy operation. This means
that if the user provides the wrong location or byte-count, the
improper operation is trapped and the kernel code can return
an error code, usually -EFAULT.
Drivers that use memcpy() when accessing user-provided space
(such as in read(), write(), ioctl(), etc.) are simply broken
and should not be used. They can cause other modules and/or
kernel functions to fail in mysterious ways.
