Hi everybody: is hotplug for the SATA 3114 chipset by Silicon Image 
supposed to work?
I've got a Tyan B2882 GX28 wth an embedded Sil 3114 controller.
Linux kernel is 2.6.8.1
The system sees 2 Maxtor drives (sda and sdb) and as far as raid1 
creation everything seems to work fine. (sata ports 1 and 2)
The problem is that the i/o subsystem seems to freeze whenever I 
hot-remove one of the raid1 drives.
Any Info would be appreciated, thanks.
