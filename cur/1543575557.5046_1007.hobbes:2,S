I have a PC164 Alpha (500Mhz) and I get hard lock ups randomly when 
accessing the internet.  It happens very frequently (like within a few 
minutes) with 2.4 kernels, but happens much more infrequently with 2.2 
kernels.  Also, I have to compile the kernel for generic alpha (NOT PC164) 
otherwise I get ide-probe errors on bootup.  My network card
is a 3com boomerang (I think? it uses 3c59x.o and it's PCI). Any ideas?
