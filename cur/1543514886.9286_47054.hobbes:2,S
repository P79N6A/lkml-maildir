Stephen,
Understood. I'll look at this.  I am trying to stick with establish
interfaces.  However, since all of the functions are marked "static"
it's impossible to do this with a loadable module because I cannot
import the functions I need from buffer.c, even if I am a kernel module
linked with the kernel.  Petty dumb, huh?
