Hi.  The kernelnewbies list didn't answer, so I'm asking here.  It's
not a big deal, but it might be a little documentation bug.
---------------
What is the meaning of the comment above forget_pte?  It's a void
function, so there's no value returned.  
/*
 * Return indicates whether a page was freed so caller can adjust rss
 */
static inline void forget_pte(pte_t page)
{
	if (!pte_none(page)) {
		printk("forget_pte: old mapping existed!\n");
		BUG();
	}
}
