I think we can do a pretty well guess by killing the task with higher
allocation rate. I don't like much looking other information because they
could be misleading and they simply complicate the equation. I'd prefer
doing the decision looking only the allocation rate and to see what
happens. At the moment we don't have an allocation rate information and to
gather it we'll have to harm (a little) a fast path...
