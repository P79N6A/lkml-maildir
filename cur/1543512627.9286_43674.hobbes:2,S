Two linux routers A and B  .... both are on the 192.168.50/24 and
172.16/16 nets
Router A is at 192.168.50.1 and has a WAN connection to 192.168.10/24
Router B has a route:
192.168.10.0	192.168.50.1	255.255.255.0 UG	0	0  eth1
Problem is that if a workstation on the 172.16.0.0/16 net tries to use
Router B as its default gateway, it can not get to 192.168.10/24 even
though packet rules specificly allow forwarding between 172.16/16 and
192.168/16 in both directions.
If I add a second route
192.168.10.0	172.16.0.1	255.255.255.0 UG	0	0  eth2
It works. 
Why do I need both routes on the router?
Why won't packets arriving on 172.16.0.254 be forwarded to 192.168.10.2
via 192.168.50.1 ???
