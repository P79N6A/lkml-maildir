PCI walking it soo late to decide wether to enable the DART no ? In any
case, we need a table, so I wouldn't bother with PCI walking here.
Anyway... we should be able to have almost no perf. degradation or even
an improvement with the DART thanks to virtual merging. Currently, we
pay a cost due to our stupid invalidate mecanism that we should really
fix by shooting the TLB directly. Also have you made sure all your
additions for handling crappy hardware are nicely wrapped in unlikely()
statements ? :)
