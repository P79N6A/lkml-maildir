Actually this patch does not work for make ARCH=um distclean (at least it does
not work for me) because there is no Makefile in arch/um/include/sysdep/
(something like a fix attached).
Also after "distclean", you cannot build UML anymore.
It fails to execute "prepare" target and therefore include/asm/arch
symlink (and others ) is not made and build fails.
