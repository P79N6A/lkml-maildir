I made all the changes Pekka suggested, except:

That assignment turns out not to be redundant.  If a security variable 
is recognized, you want the length to be 0 so as not to expose the 
password.  In that case the following "getproplen" call won't be executed.
That logic was adapted from the existing file fs/proc/devtree.c .  It 
turns out that the code there has a bug: You really want to look for 
just "security-password" ; there is no need to, and good reasons not to, 
suppress the length of "security-mode" and "security-#badlogins".  (Good 
OFW implementations won't leak the password length anyway, so check is 
only needed as a workaround).
I have rewritten the code for clarity and correctness thusly:
        if (strcmp(propname, "security-password") == 0) {
            len = 0;        /* Don't leak password length */
        } else {
            callofw("getproplen", 2, 1, node, propname, &len);
        }
