Hi Andi, Ray, et.al.,
Just want to let you know that I'm still planning to push
my patches to NUMA mempolicy for filemap support and
page migration. I've been swamped with another task at work,
but later this week I will post the latest patches for review.
I haven't been following Ray's manual page migration thread
but will get up-to-speed also, and see how it impacts my patchset
to mempolicy.
Steve
