This is probably a stupid suggestion, but here it goes anyway: the
kernel has to be written on disk by something, right?
So if the "something" knows (or can get to know) the sector/tracks
layout of the disk it's writing the kernel onto, it could store this
information in the bootblock (is there space for that?). The bootblock
code would then just read this info and use it.
Of course, this would mean that making a kernel-bootable floppy
wouldn't be as simple as cp'ing the kernel image to /dev/fdwhatever,
but if a script/program designed to do this was included with the
kernel source (it wouldn't be too big ...) ...
