 Could you turn quota off and run 'quotacheck' to check quotas?
That should fix number of used blocks... Then could you still
see that number of blocks quota reports doesn't match with 'du'
after some time? Do you have any way how to make quotas count
bad? Are you running NFS on /home?
  I'm just asking to get idea what might be going on as I don't have
other reports as yours...
