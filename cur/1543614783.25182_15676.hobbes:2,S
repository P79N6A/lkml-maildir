OK.  Background, for anyone who doesn't know this: the equivalent of 
Configure.help in CML2 is the symbols.cml file.  It's actually generated
fat CML2 installation time from Configure.help.
Here's what a sample entry looks like in Configure.help form:
Support the foo feature
CONFIG_FOO
  This is a sample help entry.
Here's the same entry in CML2 format:
FOO	"Support the foo feature" text
This is a sample help entry.
.
Now.  It would be dead easy to split symbols.cml into bunch of little
files and distribute them through the source tree.  It would be just as
easy to write a script to reassemble Configure.help, but there won't be
any reason to do it.  Once CML2 goes in, nothing will use Configure.help

Um...because the cases aren't parallel?
What makes megabyte-large blocks of code bad is that they tend to be
tangled messes with unmaintainable reference and control structures.
Configure.help isn't; the entries are atoms that don't interact with
each other.
