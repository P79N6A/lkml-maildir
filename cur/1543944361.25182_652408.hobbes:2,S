Hi,
which are the "currently active Linux kernel versions" at any point in
time?  The quote is taken from 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/11/29.
Or more precisely: which are the "stable" versions I can depend on for
a more or less critical server, those that have active security
support or receive at least critical bugfixes?  I know about the
2.6.2[34].y stable git trees, but I wonder how long will those receive
attention (that is, security fixes).  Can I find a written policy
somewhere?
