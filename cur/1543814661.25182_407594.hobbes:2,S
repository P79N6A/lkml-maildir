The scary thing is that with only 7 things we can share or not,
and a 32bit field we have only 7 bits left that we can define.
Last count I think I know of at least that many additional global
namespaces in the kernel.
On the confusing side.  Unshare largely because it doesn't default to
unsharing all of the thread state.  Has the weird issue that unshare
will automatically add bits you didn't ask for (so it can satisfy your
request) and unsharing more than you requested.  Clone when presented
with the same situation returns an error.
So even while the resources are the same the interaction of the
bits really is quite different between the two calls.
