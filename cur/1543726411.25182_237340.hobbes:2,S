NAPI support for r8169 is available in recent -mm kernel and there is
a small (though noticeable) optimization wrt to interrupt disabling.

These messages would be welcome (pen/paper/serial line/image/log file
or whatever).

Please provide:
- complete dmesg log from boot up to the point where the card can 
  trnasmit and receive (please check in your log file if the output of
  'dmesg' is truncated)
- cat /proc/interrupts once the card is up
- /sbin/lspci -vx
- /sbin/lsmod
If you have any binary module loaded, please reproduce the issue with
a kernel wherein they have not been loaded.
If you believe that it could be related to hardware, you may want to
run a complete memtest to rule out memory issues.
