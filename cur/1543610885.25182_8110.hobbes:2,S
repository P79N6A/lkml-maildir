The problem is the fear of people about -ac or -pre series. What should
be done is to teach people that what they think is kernel 2.4.8 from
RedHat or Mandrake is really 2.4.8-ac7 or the like. They are shipping
-ac versions (beacuse of preferences and driver update, usually are
-ac series and not -pre series). So your 'distro rock solid kernel'
is an -ac kernel (and I do not say that an -ac kernel is not rock
solid, I have run -ac's until 13-ac7).
