No need for named initializers.  Always add any new fields in struct
pci_device_id at the end.  It does matter if you use named or unnamed
initializers, the new fields will be zero on all existing declarations.
Introducing new fields in the middle of pci_device_id introduces
version skew problems for modutils and all code that reads
modules.pcimap.
