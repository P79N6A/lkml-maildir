That's nice. Actually, that's the case on many archs already.

Ugh? This is not the meaning of your first sentence.

Care to explain in more detail? Hmm, I suppose not.
I suppose you mean that the IDE controller will use BM DMA w/ SG for
every transaction and the PIO/DMA/UDMA mode will only be different on
the IDE BUS. That's very nice, and actually will make things simpler.
I still don't see how any of the proposed patches kill the possibility
to do this.

The future (kernel point of view) will be how we make it to be. If we
make a lot of messy code, the future will be a mess. This seems to be
what you're doing. (Sorry.)
