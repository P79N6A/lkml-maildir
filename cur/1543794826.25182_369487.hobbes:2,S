I will note though that there are people who are asking for 64-bit
inode numbers on 32-bit platforms, since 2**32 inodes are not enough
for certain distributed/clustered filesystems.  And this is something
we don't yet support today, and probably will need to think about much
sooner than 128-bit filesystems....
