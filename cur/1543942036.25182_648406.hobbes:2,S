No, breakage of a userspace interface is considered a serious regression.
If this was deliberate and utterly unavoidable, well, that's bad but sometimes
these things happen.  We do prefer to go through elaborate notification
processes to minimise the disruption, which afaik did not happen here.
If, however, the breakage was was unintentional then we should find the
cause and fix it asap, and backport the fix into 2.6.24.1.
Please tell us what version of the userspace tools you were previously runnning.
Could someone in dm-devel land please get involved?
