We need to know the block size in use /before/ the start of the transfer
as we would like drivers to be able to perform transfers with single
commands as this can result in significantly better performance[1].  The
drivers for our (CSR's) WiFi chips should do this.  This isn't some (as
you suggested in a previous post) 'rare' requirement.
Therefore, we should not change the block size here.
We can also support block sizes > 512 and have this function do the
correct thing (as you'll see when I post my final patches).

[1] Consider a chip with a block size of 64 that regularly does short
transfers of between 64 - 128 bytes.  Without padding, this would
require two commands per transfer instead of just one, cutting
performance by 50%!  This scenario could be a WiFi chip doing VoIP.
