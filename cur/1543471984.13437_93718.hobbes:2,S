I tried the arca-59 patch, does it contain this too? It didn't fix my
problem, which may be related, as follows.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
It seems that the kernel time is not monotonically increasing in recent
(i386) kernels.
2.1.126 introduced a bug that is still present in 2.1.131 and also the
AC11 and arca59 patches. Code that records the time during the top half
of an interrupt may get a timestamp that is exactly 10000 microseconds
back in
time from when it should be.
An easy way to see this is to use tcpdump on a reasonably busy network
(500 to 1000 packets per second), and examine the usec portion of the
packet timestamp. This is affected because the timestamp is recorded
during interrupt time (netif_rx in linux/net/core/dev.c).
