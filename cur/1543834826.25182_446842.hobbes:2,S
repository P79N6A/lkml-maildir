Komal,
You may not call input_free_device() after calling
input_unregister_device() in the error path because unregister will
drop the reference to the device and since it was the last (and only)
reference it will free the device. input_free_device() coming after
that will try to free already freed memory.
You have several options:
1. Have separate error paths for before and after input_register_device()
2. Set input_dev = NULL after calling input_unregister_device() -
input-free-device() handles NULLs just fine.
3. Take an extra reference with input_get_device() before calling
input_unregister_device(). This way the device won't actually be freed
until you call input_free_device() later.
