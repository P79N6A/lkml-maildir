Keepalives (at the TCP level) are fundamentally evil: they overdetect
failure, in a situation that is fundamentally an application responsibility.
If you want to get a Internet architect type truly rabid for fun some time,
get them going on keepalives.  A fun way to get the likes of Dave Clark
or Vint Cerf going really non-linear is to mention "Berkeley keep-alives"
to them :-). 
Fix netscape: it should exit if it loses its connection to the X server
(there have been other badly behaved X apps in the past which even looped
if their connection went away).
If completely idle netscapes are the problem, netscape should time itself 
out and exit after a while.  It is perfectly reasonable for Netscape to 
test it can talk to the X server once in a while (probably on the scale 
of hours or even days).
You don't want to check with any frequency, or you lose your applications
because of a transient network outage, which sucks.
Other applications need other failure policies: this is why it isn't
appropriate at the TCP level.
Now, this whole topic needs some help in X toolkits right now, and
since laptops bring this issue somewhat higher to the fore, a number
of folks are beginning to think about what ought to be done here.
