	I would agree with you NOW.  Not back then, though.  Back then,
the only competition was PEM (and that was years after PGP was on the
scene) and S/MIME was not even a dream.  There was no standard what-so-
ever and PGP was addressing more than just E-Mail.  Plain mime existed
back then, but it sucked canal water back then too.  It CERTAINLY was
not the paragon of interoperability back when PGP 2.3 was king.
