Perhaps comment about this should be added to input.h?

I still miss few descriptions... On avermedia remote control there are
buttons labeled as "preview", "autoscan", "freeze", "capture" and few
keys without label (5 of them :-(). I mapped that somehow, but it
might not be ideal:
        case 0xc577c0: return KEY_EJECTCD;      /* Unmarked on my controller */
        case 0xd77c0: return KEY_INFO; /* preview */
        case 0xad77c0: return KEY_SEARCH; /* autoscan */
        case 0x6d77c0: return KEY_BREAK; /* freeze */
        case 0xed77c0: return KEY_PVR; /* capture */
