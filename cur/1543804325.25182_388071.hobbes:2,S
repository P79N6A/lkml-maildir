Our lowest-level driver works in the absence of any IB support being
compiled into the kernel, so in that situation, there are no QPs or any
other management infrastructure present at all.  All of that stuff lives
in a higher layer, in which situation the cut-down subnet management
agent doesn't get used, and something like OpenSM is more appropriate.
