This generally indicates a problem in policy or the application that
needs to be fixed.  It doesn't mean that object labeling is itself
problematic, anymore than the existing owner and mode information in the
inode is inherently problematic.

Object labeling achieves both.  It doesn't require a path-based
mechanism in the kernel.

How is it less robust?  I haven't seen such an argument.

Yes.

I don't think it is religious - it has to do with the kernel's internal
model and what makes sense for the kernel to implement.  And the
question is not whether policy can/should be path-based; it is whether
the kernel mechanism should be path-based.  And further, whether even
such a path-based kernel mechanism should be done in the manner in which
AppArmor does it.  Bad example, I suppose, but consider inotify - does
it regenerate pathnames in the kernel, and use those pathnames in its
own mechanism?
