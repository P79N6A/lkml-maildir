I think the problem is that you want it merged all at once, and it's too much
code for doing so.  The splitting is a separate thing - previously the patches
were too big, now they are too small, but from the reviewer's point of view
it's about the same: you can't get a grip on what's going on and why.

No.  The additional work on your part _is_ _needed_ so that _other_ _people_
may feel comfortable with your code in the kernel.  Now, apparently, they are
not, for various reasons, and you're just refusing to help them.
Greetings,
