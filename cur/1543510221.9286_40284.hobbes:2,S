it did see the card but can't initialize it.
now the senario;
on 2.3.18 --- > only checksum error during boot but network access
was ok
on 2.3.18ac series before donald's 0.99M 3c59x.c -- > only checksum
error during boot but network access was ok
on 2.3.18ac7 --> checksum error and card cannot be initialize
on 2.3.18ac8 --> card can be initialize but no network ( forget to
watch for the checksum error )
an ifconfig shows that the interface is up and it can't access
network
I really do not know why ....
