OK, is a bit more stable now ... before:
Process fork+exit: 294.4118 microseconds
Process fork+exit: 279.1500 microseconds
Process fork+exit: 280.0000 microseconds
Process fork+exit: 280.0000 microseconds
Process fork+exit: 277.2222 microseconds

I can probably butcher that around by taking a few derived medians and
averages to get pretty consistent numbers out of it (std dev < 1% for 99%
of the time). Though 10 runs with ENOUGH=1000000 is kinda slow for all
tests, so I probably won't be able to do this by default for every version.
If there are any more suggestions on added stability, I'd love to hear them.
Is cool to have something big enough to profile too ;-)
Thanks very much,
M.
