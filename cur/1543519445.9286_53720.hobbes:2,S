You're telling the kernel that you want to allocate all memory in
the machine, and it is letting you.  In addition, the kernel
allows software to allocate more virtual memory than the system
contains.  This is called "overcommit" because a lot of software
allocates memory "just in case" it needs it, but never actually
uses it.  Thus, on any system with or without overcommit, anyone
can easily grab all available memory.  If this is not a desired
effect, one can simply enable process accounting, and use the
shell ulimit command to limit resources such as memory, disk
quotas can limit disk usage.
You're saying that the system ran out of disk space?  I can't see
how running a program that does not write to the disk can use all
the disk space.  I can see how it could easily eat up all
physical memory, and then your swap space, but not your available
disk space.  Please elaborate.

Elaborate on "checked up the hard disk space".  What hard disk
space, and how did you check it?  What commands did you run, and
what were the results?  How did this differ from what you
expected?  A screenshot of the output of the commands you ran
would be intuitive as well.
