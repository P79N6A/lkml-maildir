Daniel, this is good stuff.  Thanks.

So all of those files were written to by their application
during the failed session.
Question on the table is: did the kernel write the wrong
stuff into those files, or did it forget to write the
right stuff?
Is the incorrect content within those files recognisable
at all?  If so, what is it?

That sounds like metadata corruption.  Are you sure that
the file doesn't have a chunk of invisible nulls in it,
after the text?  Because if it got chopped off in this
manner, e2fsck should have detected something.

It would be good if you had the time to do that.
