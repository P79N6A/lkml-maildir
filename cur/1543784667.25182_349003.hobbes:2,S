Subject: [patch 0/7] Uml merge for 2.6.14
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/10/115

Merge easy part of my local Uml tree - mostly little bugfixes, and some tested
VM oneliners.
One patch (linker script change, adding dwarf debug sections) is applied to
i386 and x86-64 as well, on request(?) by Sam Ravnborg.

Inform me of my mistakes, so I can keep imitating Homer Simpson's "Doh!".
