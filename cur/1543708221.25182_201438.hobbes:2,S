If you don't have any programming tools and no access to any (like
a banking or restrictive office environment), and there is no
way to get any external executable files to run, i.e., no floppy
or no shell that could possibly access one, then writing a minimal
'ls' program that allows the clerk to see what's in her directory
might be useful.
So, it just might not be, as you say; "an incredibly stupid idea".
