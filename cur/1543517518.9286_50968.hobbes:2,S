How about:
	printk("Your module function address = %p\n", .....);
Or, define an ioctl() to return the address of any of your module
functions like open(), read(), write(), close(), etc. This is the
kernel address, based upon the kernel code-segment, i.e., what
you see in System.map.
There isn't an address of 'module' because the functions within the
module are put in whatever order your source-code was written.
Compile your module with the -S option and look at the way it's
layed out.
Cheers,
