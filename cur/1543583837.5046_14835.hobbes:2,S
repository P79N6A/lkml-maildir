The last little tiny thing that bothers me: why? Why only ' ' and '\t' _in
this case_? As someone mentioned, even isspace() returns whitespace.
A possible answer (that i can think of), is that those ar the whitespaces,
which are in IFS (as said previously), taking out us from kernel-space
into userspace. But imho we shouldn't define another set whitespace for
this case, can't we just use what isspace() says?
(okay, I'm not for this '\r' thingy, I just want to see the reasons.)
