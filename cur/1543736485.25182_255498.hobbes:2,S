Entirely true.  But in the interest of doing it consistently AND my 
way, I have never used the make kernel install feature, doing my own 
copying, renameing etc.  And my own grub.conf editing too.
In my case (and I'm an old (70ish) fart getting stuck in my ways) I 
simply haven't needed to fix what isn't broken until such time as it 
actually does break.   It isn't broken, yet..  :-)
