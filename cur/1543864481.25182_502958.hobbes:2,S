It looks like Tejun's patch essentially does the same thing as mine with 
the addition of the control from userspace. There is one exception 
though, my patch also does the stop on removal of the SCSI disk (i.e. 
writing 1 to its "delete" file in sysfs, what scsiadd -r does). I think 
it makes sense if the user selected the disk to be spun down on shutdown 
to do it on removal as well, as it is potentially about to be physically 
removed/powered down (especially for USB or FireWire disks).
