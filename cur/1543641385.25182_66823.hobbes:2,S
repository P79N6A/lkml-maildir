Indeed it is.  In 2.4.19 we have:
(vmscan.c: shrink_cache)                        (page_alloc.c: __free_pages)
365       if (unlikely(!page_count(page)))
366               continue;
					        444         if (!PageReserved(page) && put_page_testzero(page))
          [many twisty paths, all different]
511       /* effectively free the page here */
512       page_cache_release(page);
					        445                 __free_pages_ok(page, order);
                                                [free it again just to make sure]
So there's no question that the race is lurking in 2.4.  I noticed several
more paths besides the one above that look suspicious as well.  The bottom
line is, 2.4 needs a fix along the lines of my suggestion or Christian's,
something that can actually be proved.
It's a wonder that this problem manifests so rarely in practice.
