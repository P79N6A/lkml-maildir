Quoting from "VMS General User's Manual", section 2.1.1 Filenames, Types,
and Versions, "You can control the number of versions of a file by specifying 
the /VERSION_LIMIT qualifier to the DCL commands CREATE/DIRECTORY, SET DIRECTORY, 
and SET FILE."
It has been a while (about 12 years), but IIRC, you could set /VERSION_LIMIT=1 and
effectively get rid of the annoying versions.  But some people, the Aunt Tillie
types, were always tripping over their shoelaces and unintentially deleting files.
For those people, the version feature probably seemed a blessing rather than a
curse.
