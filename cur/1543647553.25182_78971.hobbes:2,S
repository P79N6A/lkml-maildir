   So i suspect this O_STREAMING will revive the disk->disk
 data copying transfer rate for large files like these bloody
 mpeg4 .avi`s ;)
   Disk transfers depends on the drive being constantly busy
 and this new report from the battlefield brings a new hope.
   The only thing left is to adopt the userland tools
 like cp and mc...
