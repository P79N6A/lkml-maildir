Offtopic, but that's a premature optmztn.  O(n) linear searches work just
fine for disk elevators under most circumstances - we don't get may
complaints about CPU consumption in the 2.4 elevator.
A disk isn't going to retire more than 100 requests/sec in practice, and
the cost of an all-requests search is relatively small.
Once the new design is settled in, is proven to be useful and desirable,
that's the time to start thinking about millioptimisations such as
converting the search complexity from O(n) to O(log(n)).
