Hm. Thats strange. Your interface is not UP. It's not supposed to
do any tx/rx at all. Try to up it. If it does not work,
strace 'ifconfig eth0 up' under both kernels and compare.
It is UP (of course) :-)
Only "RUNNING" is missing, comparing 2.4 to 2.6.  Other than that, both
ifconfig output are identical (and those 'carrier' counts, obviously).
The thing is, the more I research the more it looks like a local problem, as
I don't find a lot of references in google, and those who are enjoying the
same problem are as clueless as I am.
