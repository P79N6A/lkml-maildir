I'll try to get to it - I've spent the last two days on sparse making sure 
that I can do flow-control checking (things like "a function that gets a 
spinlock needs to release it"), and it will take a while before I get out 
of it.
But yes, I think it makes sense to have a "unique type" thing that allows 
arithmetic. And I think it makes sense to have another unique type that 
disallows _all_ operations (ie truly opaque cookies, where the only valid 
op is to compare it with another cookie).
Maybe Al is interested..
