I tried to do an objdump but it gave an error. How am I suppose to do an 
objdump?
$ objdump -x /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.29-rc2-git
objdump: /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.29-rc2-git: File format not recognized
$ readelf -a /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.29-rc2-git
readelf: Error: Unable to seek to 0xc031f2eb for section headers
readelf: Error: Not an ELF file - it has the wrong magic bytes at the start
$ ls -la /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.29-rc2-git
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2286480 2009-01-19 18:44 /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.29-rc2-git
Anyways, I've uploaded the extracted data.tar.gz file from the kernel 
deb file created when I
build a kernel (I use ubuntu and make-kpkg). The archive includes the 
kernel, config, system.map
and modules that I used. The files can be found at 
http://jdserver.homelinux.org/bugreports/002/
There are 2 files: data-norevert.tar.bz2 is a build without the revert, 
data-revert.tar.bz2 has the revert.
I think peter annema might have have a reason why it's crashing firefox.
If sizeof(struct pt_regs) != sizeof(unsigned long) the the stack could 
become
unbalanced if other code is not expecting a struct pt_regs.
