It sounds to me like you are saying that a minute of your time is
more valuable than a minute of each of several other peoples time.
The only two people I gladly accept that argument from are Linus
and Andrew.
For the rest of us, it is important to minimize the total workload
of all us combined, not to optimize our individual output.
What you don't test, several others of us get to test.  Only its often
more work, for -each- of us, as we each have to figure out which of
1000 patches caused the breakage.
