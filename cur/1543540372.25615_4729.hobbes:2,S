The evidence from the MS world is that buffer overflows are the _least_ of
your worries in a component based environment. Complete inability to build
a coherent security model combined with people who wave their arms around when
asked hard questions about it are most of the problem.
Nobody in the windows world is much into buffer overflows right now, you dont
need them to tear apart a windows system. There's a lesson there for gnome.
