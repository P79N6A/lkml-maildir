Hmmm, I don't think moving it around is worth the trouble
(nevertheless, I will test later if I find time).
For a full preemption kernel, both timer code and workqueue code
are executed in a thread of their own. If I know that there is a
500 us piece of code in either of them, I have to adjust the prio
of the corresponding thread (and all others) accordingly anyway.
For a non-full preemption kernel, your patch moves the 500 us 
piece of code from kernel to thread context, so it really 
improves things. But is 500 us something to worry about in a
non-full preemption kernel?
