Hello list,
it`s great that linux now has i/o re-nice with cfq now, but how can the 
admin determine HOW MUCH i/o a process is actually generating ?
have seen this on windows (process explorer from sysinternals) and on 
solaris: (psio 
http://users.tpg.com.au/bdgcvb/psio.html
  and pio
http://www.stormloader.com/yonghuang/freeware/pio.html
),  but what`s the 
Linux (commandline) equivalent ?
is there a modified top/ps with i/o column, or is there yet missing 
something at the kernel level for getting that counters from ?
regards
Roland K.
systems engineer.
