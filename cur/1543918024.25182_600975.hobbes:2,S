user-space spinlocks (in anything but SCHED_FIFO tasks) are pretty 
broken because they waste CPU time. (not as broken as yield, because 
"wasting CPU time" is a more deterministic act, but still broken) Could 
you cite a single example where user-space spinlocks are technically the 
best solution?
