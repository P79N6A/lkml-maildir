Yes, it's definitely related to this...

Are you using the v2.0 nbd-client from nbd.sf.net?

This corresponds to the following source:
lo->sock->ops->shutdown(lo->sock, SEND_SHUTDOWN|RCV_SHUTDOWN);
Somehow, lo->sock is NULL here. The only way I see that this could
happen is if NBD_CLEAR_SOCK got called out of order (or you're 
using some non-standard nbd-client).
I guess it would be best to protect the NULLing of lo->sock 
in NBD_CLEAR_SOCK just in case, anyway.
Would you be willing to test a patch against 2.4.21?
