Hmm. I would have expected it to be the other way round, since I guess you 
need to do the reading synchronously - or do you read the image, then 
decompress it? (I'm reading and decompressing at the same time, using 
readahead to avoid waiting for pages all the time).
I haven't had the chance to revisit uswsusp yet - I did sysfs support on 
Monday (took ages to figure it out!). Ah... so many things to do, and so 
little time to do them all!
Regards,
Nigel
