Now see the code.
First, it checks the ext_csd_struct.
       ext_csd_struct = ext_csd[EXT_CSD_REV];
        if (ext_csd_struct > 2) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "%s: unrecognised EXT_CSD structure "
                        "version %d\n", mmc_hostname(card->host),
                        ext_csd_struct);
                err = -EINVAL;
                goto out;
        }
        => here possible values are 0, 1, 2
        => It only accepts the ext_csd 2 but my *broken* card has 1.
so it's failed.
        if (ext_csd_struct >= 2) {
                card->ext_csd.sectors =
                        ext_csd[EXT_CSD_SEC_CNT + 0] << 0 |
                        ext_csd[EXT_CSD_SEC_CNT + 1] << 8 |
                        ext_csd[EXT_CSD_SEC_CNT + 2] << 16 |
                        ext_csd[EXT_CSD_SEC_CNT + 3] << 24;
                if (card->ext_csd.sectors)
                        mmc_card_set_blockaddr(card);
        }
In my MMC Spec. (v4.2), there's no problem to read it even though it's
revision 1.1
Anyway how do it handle this one? Do you have any idea?
Thank you,
