Maybe it needs a better name (and some documentation too :) ), but
sometimes it would be nice to have at least two variants of
virt_to_phys(). A fast version that does no error checking and only works
normal kernel memory, this would be useful for the mm system, where we
know most of the time that the address is valid. And a slow version that
checks for possible errors and also works e.g. on vmalloced memory (but
that isn't the case on ia32 currently).

The other possibiliy would to remove __pa()/__va() from any portable code,
the most important points are mm/memory.c, drivers/char/mem.c and now 
also mm/bootmem.c. They expect __va() to work like phys_to_virt(). Then
these macros could be used for any architecture specific purpose.
