No, I don't think he needs any of those beasts.
My theory on why it happens (which is just a theory, mind you, but I feel
better about having a theory, and I have a fairly simple patch to try out
that I sent out just a moment ago) is as follows:
 - CPU#1 closes the master side of a pty pair, and as a result does a
   "tty_hangup()" on the slave side. "tty_hangup()" is really designed for
   use of asynchronous events (ie called from interrupt handlers), and
   as such won't actually do the hangup event itself, because an interrupt
   handler cannot muck around with major kernel data structures. 
   So what "tty_hangup()" does, is to just queue the hangup, along with
   the tty pointer. The _actual_ hangup will be done the next time we do a
   reschedule which forces the tq_immediate queue to be executed.
 - CPU#1 closes the slave side on the pty pair, immediately after closing
   the master.
 - CPU#2 is in the scheduler, and happens to find the tq_immediate thing,
   and starts executing it. However, the first thing the hangup thing will
   do is to aquire the kernel lock (because now we're _really_ going to
   hang up, we're not in a interrupt context any more, and we can do
   whatever we want, including locking things down)
   CPU#2 blocks, because CPU#1 is still busy doing the actual close thing. 
 - in the meantime CPU#1 has (correctly) decided that both the master and
   the slave have closed, and is going to do a "release_mem()" to actually
   free up the memory for the tty data structures. Before it does the
   relese_mem, though, it wants to flush all tty task queues, becuase it
   doesn't want to leave any pending events on the tty's that are going
   away: 
        /*
         * Make sure that the tty's task queue isn't activated.
         */
        run_task_queue(&tq_timer);
        run_task_queue(&tq_scheduler);
        /*
         * The release_mem function takes care of the details of clearing
         * the slots and preserving the termios structure.
         */
        release_mem(tty, idx);
   The above works beautifully on an UP box, but on an SMP box there won't
   be any task queues to be run, but there _is_ a pending (and now stale)
   task queue sitting on the other CPU. That won't be found by the above
   code, because it's no longer on the task queues itself - it has been
   run, but is busy. 
   So CPU#1 releases all tty information, and returns. As part of
   returning from the system call, it releases the kernel lock.
 - CPU#2 unblocks, and now tries to do a hangup() on a tty that has been
   free'd. BOOM.
Anyway, I think the above explains it, and it also explains why you get
random corruption and strange behaviour - we're using a tty pointer that
really doesn't exist any more. It also explains why this only happens on
SMP, even though every single piece of code is protected by the kernel
lock.
(Lesson of the day: even having a kernel lock _everywhere_ is not
necessarily good enough, if you pass data around from one lock to another
without references or similar - there won't be any concurrency, but the
data can be stale even so).
The patch I sent out (and here it is appended again) is completely
untested, and may not work at all (maybe the first time you close a pty
pair the kernel will blow up), but I wanted to check the above theory by
just making the pty case completely synchronous - which it should be
anyway, because it's just silly to use the routine designed for
asynchronous events for something synchronous like a pty that doesn't use
interrupts at all.
Anyway, that two-liner is good enough to essentially make the above case
completely impossible to trigger on any normal machine, but I'll still
have to do something else to make sure that _real_ asynchronous hangup
events can't lead to problems. The easiest way to fix things is probably
to do a simple reference count on the tty structures, but I want to
validate the basic problem first.
