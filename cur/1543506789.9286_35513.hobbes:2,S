Hi,
I'm interested in using the raw io device, in the 2.3.x kernel series, as my
application wants to stream to and from the disk without going via memory
buffering (I'm streaming far more data than can fit in memory anyway).
However, I'm probably being a little dense here but I don't quite see how to
use the raw device.  If I set up a /dev/raw1 to bind to some partition on my
disk that I want to use raw io, then what do I do?
Does anyone have any hints or can point me in the direction of some suitable
documentation?  Or perhaps some handy examples.
Mark
