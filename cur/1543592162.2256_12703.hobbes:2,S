Then you'd better be sure that the cache (or at least, the saved
image) only contains data which is guaranteed not to be written
between successive restores from the same image.  The big advantage of
just resuming from the state of the previous shutdown (whether it's
cache or the whole kernenl state) is that you've got a much higher
expectation that nothing on disk got modified between the save and the
restore.
