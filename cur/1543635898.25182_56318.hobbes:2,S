Just to make things clear. Personally I by no way think
that ide-scsi should remain an SCSI device. My concern is only the
fact that it would be easier in my opinnion to start off with
ide-scsi and make it *independant* from the SCSI code or device handling
by separating commonly used code for MMC_ handling out of SCSI
in a kind of library (that is it) and not a common "layer"
(this could be a second step).
However this can be accomplished the other way around as well.
It will be just considerable more work.
