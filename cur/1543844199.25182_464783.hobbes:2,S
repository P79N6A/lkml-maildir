If it wasn't clear was talking specifically about the hooks for page
tracking rather than the whole patchset. If anybody wants such page
tracking infrastructure in the kernel, then this (as opposed to the
huge beancounters stuff) is what it should look like.
But as I said above, I don't know what the containers and workload
management people want exactly... The recent discussions about using
nodes and cpusets for memory workload management does seem like a
promising idea, and if it would avoid the need for this kind of
per-page tracking entirely, then that would probably be even better.
