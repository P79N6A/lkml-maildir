you're thinking what people do at home, the large business side doesn't
throw stuff out.. let me know when rhat replaces every desktop with
amd64, and ll buy you a drink if that's within the next few years ;)

yeah well what we can do (and do) is advice that hey 64bit, in some form
is really a much better environment to run servers with lots of gb on.
just takes time for products to mature on the market, even today you
can't get a lot of those boxes, not in bulk, and I am not talking about
a 1 or 2 way or a desktop with 2gb. don't confuse the systems where
4/4gb matters with your home box.
on the plus side, all the changes that went in recently seem to work
mighty well on 32gb, and I still have to see the first 64gb ia32 boxes,
m sure they are out there but I doubt that really matters any more. 
anyhow, the current VM seems to be capable of 32gb systems on ia32
happily without needing ugly 4/4. which is awesome. it's also
interesting  timing. anywys, 2.6 kicks butt quite decently :)
