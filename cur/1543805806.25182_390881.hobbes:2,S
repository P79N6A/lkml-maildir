Hi,
We collected more granular performance data for the ppc64/hugepage case.
CPI decreased by 3% when shared pagetables were used.  Underlying this was a
7% decrease in the overall TLB miss rate.  The TLB miss rate for hugepages
decreased 39%.  TLB miss rates are calculated per instruction executed.
We didn't collect a profile per se, as we would expect a CPI improvement
of this nature to be spread over a significant number of functions,
mostly in user-space.
Cheers,
Brian
