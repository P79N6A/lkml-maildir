vSecurity also implements this and many other "ported" features from
OpenWall and grSecurity.
But It's better to give users a "secure-by-default" status, at least on
those parts that don't affect negatively the stability or the
performance itself.
The LSM hook call is before the check, so, LSM framework still has the
control over it, until it releases the operation giving control back to
the standard function.
If users must rely on LSM or other external solutions for applying basic
security checks (as the framework itself only provides the way to apply
them, the checks need to be implemented in a module), then we are making
them unable to be protected using the "default" configuration.
Cheers,
