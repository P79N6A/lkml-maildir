The associate open file descriptor with a new path system
call (flink here) has already been rejected for solid
security reasons.

Eliminating the flink and using file descriptors you wind up
with something like:
	in_fd = open(oldpath, O_RDONLY);
	fstat(in_fd, statbuf);
	out_fd = open(newpath, O_WRONLY|flags, statbuf->st_mode);
	sendfile(out_fd, in_fd, 0, statbuf->st_size);
	close(out_fd);
	close(in_fd);
So if you can do it with open file descriptors why do you
need a new system call?
