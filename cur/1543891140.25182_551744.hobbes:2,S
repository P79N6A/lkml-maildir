Given existing userspace, it's never useful to generate KEY_UNKNOWN. 
Adding extra information to the event doesn't alter that.

Yes.

I think using positional keycodes would also be a mistake. We just need 
a slightly larger set of keycodes representing user-definable keys. 
There's 4 of them already - I really can't imagine there being many 
keyboards with a significantly larger set of unlabelled keys.
