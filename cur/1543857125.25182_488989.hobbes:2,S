True. Pure assignment will be lost, and is only ok for the case of a pure 
initializer (where nobody can see the old state).
Your problem will be, of course, that any architecture that does this in 
hardware will just DoTheRightThing, and as such, broken architectures with 
bad locking primitives will have to test and do source-level analysis 
more.
