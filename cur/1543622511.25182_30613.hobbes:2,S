Talking about fixups, did anyone examine the very recent pci bandwidth
patch from VIA and try using setpic for a fixup?  I emailed VIA 
asking for details of the fixup and haven't heard back yet.
(I haven't got windows installed to do a before and after comparison
of the chipset registers to try the fixup here.)

Peak transfer rates increased from 10-40%
