Subject: [patch 0/3] add perform_write to a_ops

a_ops->perform_write() was left out from Nick Piggin's new a_ops
patchset, as it was non-essential, and postponed for later inclusion.
This short series reintroduces it, but only adds the fuse
implementation and not simple_perform_write(), which I'm not sure
would be a significant improvement.
This allows larger than 4k buffered writes for fuse, which is one of
the most requested features.
This goes on top of the "fuse: writable mmap" patches.
Thanks,
Miklos
