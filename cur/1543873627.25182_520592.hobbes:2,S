In fact the role of swsusp_shrink_memory() is to ensure that our subsequent
atomic allocations won't fail.
Still, the particular allocations in create_basic_memory_bitmaps() are made
before we call swsusp_shrink_memory(), so it's better to use GFP_NOIO in there.
I'll prepare a patch for that on top of the current series.
