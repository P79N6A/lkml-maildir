But then you get the problem that upgrading from one kernel release to
the next loses the persistent data; either option has potential
problems.  I am tending towards no version number and have a flag on
insmod that says "the following parameters may not exist in the module,
be silent about any unknown symbols", the flag is automatically set by
modprobe for persistent parameters.
Going forward is not a problem, going backwards silently ignores
unknown parameters.

It makes no sense to allow duplicate module names in the same kernel
tree.  "modprobe foo" - which one gets loaded?
