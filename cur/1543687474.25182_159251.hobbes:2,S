This patch was posted on the list on August 14th ( with 'RO binaries'
instead of 'non-readable' ) and got no response. As it is very important
for us, I'd like to ask anyone who's involved with interpreters and
binfmt_misc to review the proposed patch and comment.
Thanks,
Yoav.

The proposed patch solves a problem for interpreters that need to
execute a non-readable file, which cannot be read in userland. To handle
such cases the interpreter must have the kernel load the binary on its
behalf. The proposed patch handles this case by telling binfmt_misc, by
a special flag in the registration string, to open the binary for
reading and pass its descriptor as argv[1], instead of passing the
binary's path. Old behavior of binfmt_misc is kept for interpreters
which do not specify this special flag.
The patch is against linux-2.6.0-test3
