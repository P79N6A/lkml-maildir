I've been running /sbin/hdparm -c1 -d1 -u1 -X34 -W1 -k1 -K1 /dev/hd[ac] on
all hard drives since about two years ago, (though I only had the Maxtor
drive for some of that time).  I haven't had a single crash caused by
something I couldn't attribute to something (i.e., the 'stuck on TLB IPI
wait' problem fixed in 2.2.10)

Currently 2.2.10, though none have shown problem here.
My video card is a generic S3 ViRGE using the S3V X server, you?
