select doesn't appear to work quite like this.  For example:
config A
	bool "A"
config B
	bool "B"
	depends on A
config C
	bool "C"
	select B
In this case, it's possible to turn C on and A off.  B will be on, even
though it depends on A and A is off.
The kconfig docs say that "B..  depends on A" sets the maximum value of B
to be that of A.  Since A=0, the max value of B is 0.
The kconfig docs also say that "C..  select B" sets the minimum value of B
to be that of C.  Since C=2, the minimum value of B is 2.
So we have B>=2 and B<=0, which is obviously impossible.  Yet *config has
no problem with this, and will set B=2 even the 'depends' means B must be
0.  It seems like "select" will override any other dependencies.
