It's possible.  Most of those changes are innocuous.  They add routines
that don't get used until a later patch.  However one of them might be
responsible.

This patch affects OHCI.  You can try reverting it, to see if that makes 
any difference.  It probably should have been left out of -mm, since it 
interacts pretty strongly with some later USB PM patches that did get left 
out.

If reverting that patch doesn't help, please post the relevant dmesg log 
after setting CONFIG_USB_DEBUG.
