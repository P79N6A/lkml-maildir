Hmm, neither do I, it must be from a build from one of my local
branches (unfortunately it seems like it's one I don't have around any
more).
Ok, so I guess I'll have to try and see if it happens again with a new

my own patches since I've not been doing anything to the aic7xxx
driver lately beyond pretty trivial stuff, but I guess I can't rule it
out.
