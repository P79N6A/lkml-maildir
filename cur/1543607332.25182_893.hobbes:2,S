My advice is: don't try to waste Linus's or Alan's time on this.  Just make 
the patch, it isn't that hard.  Just post it, and if you get it partly wrong 
Rik and/or Andrea will be sure to tell you.

So why are you asking developers who have plenty of other things to do, to do 
that work?

Do it whatever way you want, that's why you have the source.  I'd suggest 
'diff', starting with the files in Andrea's list.  Then edit the patch by 
hand, removing the chunks that obviously aren't related.
