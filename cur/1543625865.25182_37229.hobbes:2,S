Thanks. Just after i typed the mail i looked the Makefile... sorry for being
a little impatient.!!
I usually add the following to the header file to identify if the build is a
smp/up build. which promped me to find out immediatly before building.
When we work with redhat binaries and sources, we see uname -r gives the
kernel build correctly. for e.g 2.4.7-10smp etc. I fixed the Makefile now to
generate this header.
This becomes handy to identify what kernel is running. Also comes handy to
place the modules in the right directly when modules are build.
Iam not sure if iam the only one doing this, could this be added to the
kernel source tree?
#include <linux/config.h>
#ifndef  CONGIG_SMP
#define UTS_RELEASE	"2.4.18"
#else
#define UTS_RELEASE	"2.4.18smp"
#endif

version.h gets automatically generated by the kernel build process.
