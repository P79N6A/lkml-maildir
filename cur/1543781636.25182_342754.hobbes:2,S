Ok, makes sense to me; does the following patch work for everybody? The
wording is a bit awkward, but so is the issue :)
Description: Fix schedule_timeout()'s comment, indicated the inter-tick
rounding issue. Since the kernel does not keep track of an inter-tick
position in jiffies, a caller which wishes to sleep for at least a
certain number of jiffies should add its request to the *next* jiffies
value (meaning add 1 to its relative request). Make that clear in the
comment.
