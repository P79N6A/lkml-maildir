Hi, just wanted to note that the sound in 2.6.7 and 2.6.8.1 is dead:
after compiling and installing etc the new kernels first thing i was seeing was 
occasional lockups in 2.6.7 and was blaming nvidia's taint. 2.6.8.1 saw far more 
lockups, however after investigating the issue of the nvidia drivers i found it wasn't the 
gfx system that was causing it, it was sound.
playing with mpg123 i got complaints of libao being broken, so i upgraded that, the i 
got pcm_hw something or other I/O errors.
it's a GA 7N400 Pro 2 Mobo, with nforce2 chipset though i believe it uses a realtech 
sound chip (not sure of the type). I found a couple of references to this being stuffed, 
and HP specific fixes (which don't help :) )
Distro is Slack 10.0
Any thoughts on a solution? please CC chakkerz@optusnet.com.au / reply all on this, 
so i get the message :)
thanks
