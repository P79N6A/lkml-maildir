Leonard,
This is a copy of a mail I sent a few days ago without having received any
answer.
Can you pls have a look ? This problem is still pending and solved by the moment
with a system shutdown each 3 days. It feels that the more we keep the system
without a shutdown the more we have this problem, but this remember me Window$
NT !!
Thanks is advance.

Hello Leonard,
The system with the eXtremeRaid 1100 adapter is working fine but from time
to time it crash without reporting a trouble on /var/log/message
We have a "similar" system working in Geneva with  different RAID controller:
DPT SmartRAID
I suspect an I/O Interrupt problem.  Do not ask me why. 25 years working with
computers
could be an answer.
We have already changed the mother board, as well as the two Pentiums. No
difference.
The system crash once each 8 or 12 days, then we need 4 hours to set it back.
The Geneva
system is working since weeks.
This is /proc/interrupts of the eXtremeRAID system:
 0:    1485418   timer
 1:        710   keyboard
 2:          0   cascade
 5:    1747992 + Mylex DAC1164P, + aic7xxx
 7:         24 + BusLogic BT-930
 8:          1 + rtc
10:         14 + BusLogic BT-930
11:     696449   eth0
13:     125959 + IPI
14:          1 + ide0
This is the /proc/interrupts of the DPT system:
 0:  267415219   timer
 1:       8730   keyboard
 2:          0   cascade
 5:   10862040   3c509
 8:          1 + rtc
10:     316312 + BusLogic BT-948
11:   38399325   eth0
13:          1   math error
14:   13625063 + eata_dma
15:    6860687 + BusLogic BT-948
As you can see, on system eXtremeRAID interrupt 5 is shared between the 1100
board and the built in aic7xxx adaptec controller
What is your feeling about ? Is there something I can do to better analyze this
problem ?
BTW, what is IPI ?
Regards
