While e2compr is so absilutely solid as to be ridiculous, he could also
use the user space compression afforded by preloading a library module to
intercept open and read calls, and thus read .gz'ed files
transparantly. 
This has, like e2compr, been available for years. I believe Alain Knaff
did the work (correct me if I'm wrong). You want to look for something
like libz or zlib on the web (careful! There are two).
And Riley, I haven't forgotten the ram.
