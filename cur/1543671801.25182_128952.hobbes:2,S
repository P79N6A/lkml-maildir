I've tried to investigate this. What happend to iobuf.{ch} ? 
I guess bit more changes are required to make it running before 2.6 :)
Btw, authors email in head of blkmtd.c is bad.
Fanny thing, after removing this include there is declaration :
/* readpage() - reads one page from the block device */
static int blkmtd_readpage(mtd_raw_dev_data_t *rawdevice, struct page *page)
{
  int err;
  int sectornr, sectors, i;
  struct kiobuf *iobuf;
	^^^^^^^
  unsigned long *blocks;
Fast fgrep in kernel sources gives me no answer about this structure declaration.
any help guys ?
