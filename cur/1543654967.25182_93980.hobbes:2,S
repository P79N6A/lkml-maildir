  Can you give a few more details?  Does the nfs share mount, or hang at 
mounting?  What type of mount are you trying to do? (IE nfs v3 tcp, or 
v2 udp)
PS- Are you certain you aren't running iptables or ipchains? 
"/etc/init.d/ipchains stop"  Also try mounting with out locking.  "mount 
foo:/foobar /mnt/nfs -onolock"  Have you tried nfs v2? "mount -o 
nfsvers=2 foo:/foobar /mnt/nfs"
