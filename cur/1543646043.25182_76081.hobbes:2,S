This sounds like it would be exactly what EVMS needs. The only thing we would 
want to add to this list is: "*whenever a disk is modified, notify evms". For 
example, with removable media drives (such as Zip and Jaz), when a cartidge 
is changed, the capacity of the drive might change, and we would like to be 
notified of that event.

EVMS won't really be interested in partitioning changes. It only cares about 
whole devices, i.e. minor_shift == 0.

Will there be a common method for determining "media present"? The current 
method EVMS uses to determine "media changes" is somewhat inconsistent 
between IDE and SCSI.

EVMS will try to read volume metadata from each device and activate volumes 
if it finds any pertinent metadata.
