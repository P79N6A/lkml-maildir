  Right, thanks for pointing this. I guess, I was just lucky since didn't run into
problems with stack overflows. So, I agree that we should increase the 
THREAD_SIZE in case of 256KB pages up to 1/8 of PAGE_SIZE, that is up 
to 32KB.
 There is one more warning from the common code when I use 256KB pages:
   CC      mm/shmem.o
mm/shmem.c: In function 'shmem_truncate_range':
mm/shmem.c:613: warning: division by zero
mm/shmem.c:619: warning: division by zero
mm/shmem.c:644: warning: division by zero
mm/shmem.c: In function 'shmem_unuse_inode':
mm/shmem.c:873: warning: division by zero
 The problem here is that ENTRIES_PER_PAGEPAGE becomes 0x1.0000.0000
when PAGE_SIZE is 256K.
 How about the following fix ?
