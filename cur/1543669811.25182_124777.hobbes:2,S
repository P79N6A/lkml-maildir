Doesn't look like it works, the mount process gets stuck:
[root@viper root]# mount -t ext2 /dev/sda1 /mnt/zip
SCSI device sda: 196608 512-byte hdwr sectors (101 MB)
sda: Write Protect is off
sda: cache data unavailable
sda: assuming drive cache: write through
SCSI device sda: 196608 512-byte hdwr sectors (101 MB)
sda: Write Protect is off
sda: cache data unavailable

At this point the mount process is unkillable.
