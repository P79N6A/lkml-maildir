Can you try the following very simple condition?
			if (nr_buffers_type[BUF_DIRTY] > too_many) {
				if (nr_buffers_type[BUF_LOCKED] > 2 * bdf_prm.b_un.ndirty)
					wakeup_bdflush(1);
				else
					wakeup_bdflush(0);
In the long run I think we need a separate buffer class (say,
BUF_WORTHLESS :) for buffers which have been unlocked after write but
which have never been read, and to reuse these on an LRU basis when we
need new buffer heads.  That will automatically recycle dirty buffers
during intensive write operations without exerting any pressure at all
on the rest of the VM.  The old buffer cache used to do this anyway,
running LRU before growing the buffer cache if we were out of free
pages, and it makes a lot of sense to keep this behaviour for write
buffers.
