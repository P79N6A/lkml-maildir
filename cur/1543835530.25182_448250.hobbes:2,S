Hi,
it would be totally ok if the kernel had a country= command line switch
and the driver limitting functionality due that.
People that want to violate the local regulations would require to lie to
the kernel as they could install other country windows and drivers as
well.
Sure, people could modify the source as they could specify a wrong
country argument. But you can heedit the windows binary as well.
Yours,
