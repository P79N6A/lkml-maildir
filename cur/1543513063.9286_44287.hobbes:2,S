Yep. But with some versions it doesn't work very well:
sc.o(.text+0x7): relocation truncated to fit: R_386_16 data
sc.o(.text+0xc): relocation truncated to fit: R_386_16 data
sc.o(.text+0x10): relocation truncated to fit: R_386_16 data
sc.o(.text+0x15): relocation truncated to fit: R_386_16 data
make: *** [sc] Error 1
You have to turn it on/off depending upon whether you are
accessing data or not. Basically fairly broken.....
