Who knows, they could have a almost-mass-storage protocol layer that
recognizes proprietary stuff in the URBs.  It could be as simple as:
 - User clicks 'synchronize' in some windows app
 - Device driver on host does some magic to make Asus device pretend like
   removable media was inserted
 - Vista sees the new device, mounts it
 - App copies C# classes and XML files to special directories on the device
 - App ejects device
Does the screen turn on or is that software controlled too?
This is pure wild guessing since I have no clue about SideShow or this
device.  Anyway it would be hard to proceed without capturing a trace
or managing to find some docs somewhere.
