  in git terms, you'd like gitweb to provide output for command:
	git describe --contains
This is interesting feature request. I guess the support would be nice,
though in theory this operation can be a bit resource-intensive in case
there is not many tags and a lot of development (with uncached
repository, this query took quite a bit of time on my copy of the kernel
git tree). Probably this should be an optional feature and somehow dwell
on a separate page, which doesn't fit too well in the current gitweb
page structure...

  Yes, there is no necessity - you can post this on the git mailing list
without subscribing yourself.
