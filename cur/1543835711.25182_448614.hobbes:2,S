They do! Very much, actually. These happen In Real Life, so I have to
pay attention to them. Once you're in setups with > 10000 machines,
everything counts. At some certain point, you can even use HDD's
temperature sensors in old machines to diagnose dead fans.
Everything that eases recovery for whatever reason is something you
have to pay attention to. The simplicity of ext{2,3} is something I
really fail to find proper words for. As well as the really good fsck.
Once seen a SIGSEGV'ing fsck, you really don't want to go there.
