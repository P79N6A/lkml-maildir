    Hi all :))
    Is there any known bug or other issues about 2.4.19 that prevents
it from being used in a production machine? I mean, I don't worry if
the sound is broken or things like those, I mean if the IDE driver
does 'things' and the like ;))
    I'm thinking about going to 2.4.19 or the latest -ac for 2.4.20.
    Thanks a lot :)
    Raúl
