Well, Few things:
1) We have to have those probes present in the system all the time
collecting the information when read/write happens, maintaining it
and spitting it out. Since its kernel probe, all this data will be
in the kernel.
2) If we want to do this accounting (and you don't have those probes
installed already) - we can't capture what happened earlier.
3) probing sys_read/sys_write() are going to tell you how much
a data a process did read or wrote - but its not going to tell you
how much is in the cache (now or 10 minutes later).

/proc/pid/smaps will give me information about text,data,shared libs,
malloc etc. Not the filecache information about files process opened,
pages read/wrote currently in the pagecache. Isn't it ?
