And if it has an odd number then you can't read the last sector at all! - 
That's what prevents linear raid and proper NTFS support from working on 
"odd sized" partitions...
I don't see any Clean Way(TM) to fix this, as well as your "EFI Spec 
calling for physical block size" problem, apart from changing the kernel 
BLOCK_SIZE to 512 (from the current 1024) and picking up the pieces 
afterwards... - I would be very happy if someone tells me I am wrong! (-;
Note that I don't think adding any form of hacks into partition table / 
file system code to allow low-level access to the underlying device can be 
considered a Clean Way(TM) since such code has no business dealing with 
what device it is on. The only thing that such code has business dealing 
with is logical access to the particular partition in question. This is all 
IMHO...
I doubt that such a change would be accepted for 2.4 at such a late stage 
considering making the change breaks just about every block device driver 
and at least the ext2 file system (read: kernel doesn't boot if the change 
is done!). - Having said that, my development PC actually is running a 
kernel with BLOCK_SIZE = 512 but I had to do a few modifications to get it 
to work. (-:
It became apparent that despite that the code in many source files in the 
kernel uses BLOCK_SIZE macro it at the same time assumes that it equals 
1024, which is, IMHO, a strange thing to assume to say the least, but 
anyway, all those places have to be fixed first. - Ext2 is pretty much ok 
except for the fact that you need to start using the (already existing) 
MIN_EXT2_BLOCKSIZE macro in fs/ext2/super.c and you have to change the 
super_block location calculation in the same place. - My current tree 
(based on 2.4.0-test8+various patches) has fixed drivers/ide/hd.c, 
drivers/scsi/sd.c, drivers/scsi/scsicam.c(?), fs/ext2/super.c and 
fs/partitions/check.c so that the code works for any definition of 
BLOCK_SIZE (well, at least for any sane definition...) and this makes it 
work both with my IDE and SCSI hard disks and ext2 partitions as well as 
with my current devel tree version of NTFS, now being able to read the last 
sector on odd sized partitions. - Also reads (open(2)/read(2) on 
/dev/[hs]daX, for various X tested) now allow me to see all sectors. - The 
kernel also "feels" faster but that might be just wishful thinking/timing 
coincidence... no benchmarks available...
What I am fairly certain is now broken due to changing BLOCK_SIZE to 512: 
ramdisk+initrd, floppy disk(?) and raid. I have started working on the 
latter but I haven't gotten it to work yet. )-: Note that all my above 
changes don't break anything if BLOCK_SIZE is left at 1024.
I am planning on updating my patches when 2.5 comes out and start 
submitting them slowly to the various maintainers so that it should 
eventually be just possible to just change BLOCK_SIZE to 512 and recompile 
and it then all automagically works but that might be some time away...
Regards,
         Anton
