I think it is an excellent way to do it.  Nobody said you have to run 
the program and nobody forces you to use a particular program with a 
particular policy.  It puts the OOM policy in userland where -you- 
decide when and how things happen.

The kernel allocates memory within itself.  We will still reach OOM 
conditions.  It can't be avoided.
