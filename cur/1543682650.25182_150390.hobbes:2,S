But that's significantly better than any USB problem or any ALSA problem
or any ACPI problem bringing down my entire world, which is the current
situation with Linux 2.4.
I have the impression that the core developers are unaware of the fact
of how unstable Linux has become, particularly on laptops. I guess if
you do kernel work and reboot often, you never notice that. Besides,
doing stability work is "unfashionable"...
