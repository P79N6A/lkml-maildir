Good eyes. But.. this also applies to 2.4 (which should also then
get faster). So the gap between 2.4 & 2.5 must be somewhere else ?
Also maybe we can do something about that multiple memcpy in copy_fpu_fxsave()
In fact, that looks a bit fishy. We copy 10 bytes each memcpy, but
advance the to ptr 5 bytes each iteration. What gives here ?
