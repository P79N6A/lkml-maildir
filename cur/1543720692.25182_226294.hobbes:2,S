Perhaps people should read about the referenced algorithms. LRU
(including the hybrid LRU that Linux uses) is vulnerable to
"scanning" of the sort you're describing, while the above algorithms
have varying degrees of scan-resistance. As lack of scan-resistance
seems to be "the big problem" in the current VM, this looks like an
interesting direction to go in.
