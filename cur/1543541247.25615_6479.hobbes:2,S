Sorry, my mistake, the kernel hang when the root partition
/dev/discs/disc1/part2 was not found. I thought it was devfs.
I boot from hde2-HPT366 (with loadlin) and I had built ide_disc
only as a module. It was working with -test4 and 5, it is not
with test6. Must be a feature, not a bug.
Thank you for your reply
