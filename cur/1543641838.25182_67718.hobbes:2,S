Great to hear. I'd be impressed if you noticed *any* change in responsiveness
with anything on that machine.

That's a very nice test, but as you've seen, pure latency is not everything. If
you want just that you should try my ck5-ll patch which gives the lowest
latencies (check my website for the benchmarks on -ck4 which used this -ll branch).

Yes, dbench is included in the many tests available at the the Open Source
Development Lab (osdl.org) along with many others.

Once again a pure latency measure, no?

Thanks, glad you enjoy it, but it's really the combined efforts of the real
developers as you know.
Thanks for your feedback
