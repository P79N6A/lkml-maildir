I ran across the same problem the other day.  Maybe someone on the nfs 
list have a better idea on what the proper solution is.  My temporary 
solution was to go back to a 2.4 kernel with the seekdir.dif patch.
Looking at Trond's 2.6 NFS patches, there doesn't appear to be any sort 
of seekdir patch for those kernels.
As I understand it the real problem is actually in glibc.  I have to 
double check, but I think the software which showed this bug when I 
experienced it on FC2 was statically linked with an older version of 
glibc.  I can't seem to reproduce it using `ls` which I remember being 
able to last time I had the problem so that would explain it.  What 
software showed the problem for you?
See this message from the nfs list.  There is more data in the archives 
if you look.
