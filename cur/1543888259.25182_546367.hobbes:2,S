Yes, and it *BETTER*, because those are user-mode values which refer to
the newly created task.
Sticking kernel mode values in those fields would add no value, except
as a poison (since %ss == KERNEL_DS and would cause a #GP(0) if it ever
reached IRET.)  If anything, those fields should be pushed as zero or
some other poison bits.  That would be slightly better than what's there
now, which is whatever garbage happens to be on the stack.  Pushing the
kernel SS:ESP is just plain wrong (not to mention that the way you do it
doesn't even produce the right value for ESP -- you'd have to save away
ESP before you push SS.)
