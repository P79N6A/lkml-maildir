I would rather use kernel memory for far more useful things, such as
more room for actual dentries/inodes, or negative dentries found from
failed lookup() calls (i.e. proven useful).
The overhead of unlink()/create() probably swamps the rather minimal
gain from a saved lookup() in this not very common situation.
Just the opinion of somebody that doesn't matter... :-)
