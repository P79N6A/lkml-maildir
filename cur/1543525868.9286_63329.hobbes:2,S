Hi Matt,

Your reading of MP specs is adequate but reading of Linux kernel sources
(not sure about FreeBSD but they usually lag several years behind Linux
wrt modern technologies) is not. Linux does enter symmetric io mode and
any processor can handle irqs:

Perhaps you were talking about some old versions of Linux (e.g. 2.0.x)
which couldn't do that? Even kernels as old as 2.2.x work just
fine in this area.
