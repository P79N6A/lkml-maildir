Hi,
> I'll see if I can find the "magic" anywhere on the disk....
I'm reading 4 160G disks, hda...hdd, at about 24M per second per disk.
After about 170G kswapd bombed out on me with an oops.  I'm hoping it
will continue to work until I finish reading the whole disk. The
machine doesn't have swap, and 1G of RAM.
It's a dual athlon, but I haven't gotten around to compiling an SMP
kernel due to other problems. 
My personal priority is currently of getting that machine up, but
should I suspect hardware problems?

The disks are on the internal IDE controller, not on the Promise.

(I Just realized it has an AMD chipset. I somehow remembered seeing
something about VIA... Phew.)
