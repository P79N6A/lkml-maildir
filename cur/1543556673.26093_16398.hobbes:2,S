Have you ever noticed that bad patches get a lot more response than
good patches?  I think people like having something useful to say and
a simple "I like it" often doesn't seem worth it, though in reality is
very valuable.
Mayge the thing to do is include a few obvious but not very
significant errors like:
  - initialise a static variable to 0
  - use /** to introduce a comment that isn't in the right format for
    the auto-documentation stuff
  - uses lines wider than 80 characters
  - use unnecessary extra parentheses 
  - use non-standard indenting
that way people will respond because they think they have something to
say, and will hopefully comment further... :-)
But I see that you have done that .... a simple compiler error (I
think).

here we have lost the "part" automatic variable in disk_name but ....

here we use it.  Does this compile?
But apart from this, I like it, and I think that it would be good if
it went into 2.4.  
Maybe do one more iteration (or convince me that the above isn't a
bug), and ask for comment.  I promise to test and respond.
Then send it to Linus, and explain what it does, and mention that it
fixes a real issue in lvm (I assume it does as someone said so. I
haven't actually looked into that) and leave it to him.
