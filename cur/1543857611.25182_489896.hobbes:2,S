This patchset is designed to improve system responsiveness and interactivity. 
It is configurable to any workload but the default -ck patch is aimed at the 
desktop and -cks is available with more emphasis on serverspace.
Apply to 2.6.19

Changes (first significant changes since :
Added:
+sched-fix_iso_starvation.patch
A bug first introduced into 2.6.18-ck1/cks1 meant that SCHED_ISO tasks were 
not being throttled when above their cpu limit. This presents a security risk 
to any machine with user logins and upgrading for this issue should be 
considered a high priority.
 +sched-make_softirqd_batch.patch
Instead of 'nice'ing ksoftirqd we can use the policy hint of SCHED_BATCH which
specifies it as not requiring low latency. This increases the cpu use possible
under very heavy softirq traffic (such as network loads) and decreases the
latency that might otherwise be seen (such as keyboard input under heavy cpu
load on slow machines).
Split patches available.
