Ah, forgot to mention that the patch included the changes from your p1
fix (some of which I had already made, but items like the
clocksource_adj() name change is a clear improvement).
And just to be sure you know I'm not brushing your patches off: I'm
looking at patches p2, p4, p5 and p7 as the next steps, and after I get
some feedback on the patch I just sent we can discuss p3,p6, and p8.
Sound good?
thanks
