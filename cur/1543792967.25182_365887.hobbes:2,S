done, patch below.

you mean ptrace_get_task_struct?

sys_ptrace has the same code for it, in fact just about every ptrace
implementation uses ptrace_get_task_struct to handle that code,
but ptrace_get_task_struct can't be used by ia64 because some oddness
in the !PTRACE_TRACEME codepath.

yes.  it has some oddness about finding the 'right' task_struct of a
multi-threaded process.
