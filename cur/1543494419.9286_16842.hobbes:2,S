The problem I'm getting is twofold:
1. When I receive an SNA I-frame (ssap=04,dsap=04), ibmtr discards it  in
tr_rx (at line 1520 in kernel 2.2.7):
   "if (readb(llc + offsetof(struct trllc, llc))!=UI_CMD)"
2. When I send an SNA-I frame (ssap=04,dsap=04), the adapter changes the
ssap to AA and the frame type to UI in tok_send_packet (at lines 1649-1650
in kernel 2.2.7):
   "writeb(XMIT_UI_FRAME, ..."
   "writew(ti->exsap_station_id, ..."
