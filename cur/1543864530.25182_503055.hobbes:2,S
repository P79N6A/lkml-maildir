even for -rt it's not really an issue: the hotplug locks are so 
all-encompassing and so unbound at the moment that there's no realistic 
expectation for them to ever become deterministic. So we might as well 
make them encompass "everything" - without any noticeable effect.

yeah. This all looks so nice that i almost cannot believe it's true :-) 
This would allow us to rip out all the cpu-hotplug locking: wow! If only
someone would volunteer to try to pull this off and then to touch so
many subsystems ;-)
i fully agree that the opposite notifications should be traversed in 
inverse order [but this is an orthogonal improvement]. Too bad the 
notifier list is a single linked list.
