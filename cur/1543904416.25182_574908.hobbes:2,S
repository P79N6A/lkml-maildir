    Yeah, and I can't wait to see some other its users. ;-)
    This doesn't mean that shift is better anyway. If everyone considers it 
better, I give up. But be warned that shift (stride) is not the only property 
characterizing register accesses -- the regs might be only accessible as 
16/32-bit quantities, for example (16-bit is a real world example -- from 
Amiga or smth of that sort, IIRC).

    We're not obliged to be consistent with every piece of the kernel code.
