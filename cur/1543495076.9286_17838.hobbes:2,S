Greetings,
When copying data to/from user-space, we know the operation can sleep.  And
interrupt driven events (including timers) can interrupt even a
non-sleeping user-space access, right?
So in general practice, what is the preferred method of transferring data
to user-space if that data is operated on by something like a kernel timer?
For instance, if I have a block of data about 32k in size that is
(potentially) manipulated on timer expiration, what is the best way to
safely copy it to user-space intact?  Disabling interrupts is not a good
idea because the user-space access might sleep.  Should I simply copy the
data first with interrupts disabled, and then do the transfer?
