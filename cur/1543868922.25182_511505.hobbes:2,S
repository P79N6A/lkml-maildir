Right, but eventually there isn't a regular timer interrupt through the
io-apic. I don't think in the past IRQ0 stops without the system
crashing, so check_timer() could assume the timer (IRQ0) is _always_
regular.
do you know what the requirement are for routing the NMI through the
io-apic?

I think it has to do with IRQ0 . Did I mention this doesn't happen in
2.6.20 .

Do you use nmi_watchdog=1 ?
