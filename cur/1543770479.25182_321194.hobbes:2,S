Please drop the patent topic, it hasn't been relevant for years. If
you search the LKML archives for the initial release of Adeos, you
will see a thread where that specific topic is cleared up. If still
in doubt, do read the actual relevant patent application(s?), you
will see that no nanokernel/hyervisor out there fits the described
method. Not to mention that hypervisors/nanokernels have been there
for decades ... The specific patent that covers dual-kernels does
not even attempt to claim it covers the broad world of nanokernels/
hypervisors.
Hope this clears this bit, and please don't drag this further. That
particular topic has been debated more than enough, and I've said
what I had to say about it many times already. From that point of
view, I fully agree with you that there's no need to waste people's
time further.
With that said, let's go back to talking about the actual technical
arguments :D
