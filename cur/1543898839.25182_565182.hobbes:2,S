Hi,
.
I would like to see the whole disk area and erase the
hpa area in my desktop.
At first I tried "setmax.c" program but it didn't work
on SATA at least.
So I upgraeded it to FC7 and added "libata
ignore_hpa=1" option on boot command and
/etc/modprobe.conf. 
This option was accepted but still the kernel couldn't
see the whole disk area even after reboot.
I am using FC7, kernel-2.6.21 and 250 SATA disk.
Could you please give me some more tips ?
.
Warm regards,
Nobel
