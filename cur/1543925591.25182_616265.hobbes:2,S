Hello,
My mistake, it looks like the issue is to do with writing only.
Mounting a standard DVD works fine with 2.6.24-rc2-git2.
As soon as I try to use wodim or load k3b, that's when drive gets locked
up.
The issue was still there with 2.6.23-git15 , I will continue to test
with previous ones.
Regards,
Will Trives
