Just to avoid spreading misinformation: modulo some new broken hardware
(which we always try to work around when found) i386/x86-64 gettimeofday
is monotonic.  AFAIK on the currently known hardware it should be generally
ok.
However ntpd can always screw you up, but that's inherent in the design.
Safer in general is to use clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, ...) which guarantees
no interference from ntpd
