    That too. :-)

    I strongly disagree with "generic" part. The generic IDE could only be 
said of 1:1 I/O mapped IDE ports, not about this fancy mapping.

    That is only a common variation of embedded non-compliancy (which doesn't 
make it a compliancy. ;-)
    There are worse cases in the bi-endian land, even with the standard 8-bit 
regs and 1-byte stride. *Hopefully*, this driver could also support those...

    Yeah, there are also 8250 "compatible" UARTs that use 32-bit memory 
accesses, and even worse -- with some registers mapped differently than on 
8250 (those can't be called compatible by any means), yet 8250.c drives all of 
them.  I'm not really sure it was such a good idea to merge, say Alchemy UART 
support into 8250.c.

    *Hopefully*, none.  The original Kumar's driver pretended to handle 
byte-lane swapping too (but that was ugly :-).

    Nobody's talking about the advantages, just about the device tree accepted 
practices (which we've already tried to bypass with MTD node -- causing a lot 
of bashing until David Woodhouse came to help :-).

    Please read the linuxppc-dev archive's threads following form David's 
patches.  Or maybe Segher could repeat this for you. ;-)
