Hello
While we are at it, maybe someone could help me with my "antient" pine 
too. When sending patches inline (Ctrl-R) it looks fine up in the email, 
also when I am reading my own email as it came to the list, e.g.
@@ -8,9 +8,9 @@
  static void __inline__
  dc390_freetag (struct dc390_dcb* pDCB, struct dc390_srb* pSRB)
  {
-	if (pSRB->TagNumber < 255) {
However, everybody (not pine-users) complains, that white spaces got 
corrupted. And if I export the email I see
@@ -8,9 +8,9 @@
   static void __inline__
   dc390_freetag (struct dc390_dcb* pDCB, struct dc390_srb* pSRB)
   {
-	if (pSRB->TagNumber < 255) {
(notice the extra space). What is going on there and is there a solution 
(apart from switching to another mailing or sending as attachments)?
Thanks
Guennadi
