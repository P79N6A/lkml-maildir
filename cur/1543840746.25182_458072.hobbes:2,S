On i386, the command line is never stored in the bootup page; only a 
pointer to it is.  The copying is done straight into the 
saved_command_line buffer in the kernel BSS (head.S lines 79-104).
x86-64 does the same thing, but in C code (head64.c lines 45-56.)  Thus, 
if you had a problem with LILO, I suspect the problem was inside LILO 
itself, and not a kernel issue.
