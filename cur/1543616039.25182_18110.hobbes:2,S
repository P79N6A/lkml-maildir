Umm, the subsys part makes a lot of sense in terms of
logically separating the core of the kernel from the 
architecture part and the subsystem part.    While we 
need a MM to complete a kernel, we certainly don't need 
"subsys/sound/alsa/driver/es1371.c".
.
./arch
./fs
./init
./kernel
./lib
./mm
./include
./ipc
./subsys
./scripts
./Documentation
If this helps make the kernel source more like the modules
and devfs trees, then it makes even it more logically consistant.
Please remember that everyone who compiles a kernel is not
a uber kernel hacker.   Average folks will appreciate some more
structure which helps to explain how things work.

It's NOT random and it doesn't suck.
