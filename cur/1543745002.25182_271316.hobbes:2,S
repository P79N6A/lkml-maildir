Andreas,
I don't mess with signals (as said); the code just parses the same area of memory 
again and again (due to a programming error). As offered, you can get the binary 
and the sample command line to repeat (or at the least: try to) situation if you 
like. If I hadn't experienced it, I wouldn't believe myself ;-)
Regards,
Ulrich
