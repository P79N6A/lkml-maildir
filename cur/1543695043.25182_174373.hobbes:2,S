Forgive me, I'm not totally familiar w/ the sysfs/pm stuff, but normally
you need to have the xtime_lock to safely manipulate xtime. Also,
couldn't you just call settimeofday() instead?  The bit about manually
setting the timezone also confuses me, as we don't normally do this at
bootup in the kernel.  
thanks
