That it makes no difference to the generated code isn't enough. If somebody
if going over the kernel with a fine comb trying to fix memory allocations
(example as here), she will have to remember half a dozen slightly
different ways of doing the same thing, for no good reason. And probably
miss a bundle in the process. This is bad in itself.

I'd hope not.
[Yes, I can understand that each subsystem has its own "culture", and
 trying to force them all into the same mold is friction too.]
