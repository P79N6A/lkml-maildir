You seem to be using &host->host_lock, which isn't quite right. SCSI
adapters pass down a preferred lock with scsi_assign_lock, and host_lock
_points_ to that lock. So you need to be using host->host_lock. A
compile should have caught this error (build SMP, of course).

->detect() is not called with the lock held anymore...

You still have a bit of work to do :-)
