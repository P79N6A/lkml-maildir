   Is it really necessary? Someone could easily put "messed up" in
   place of it.
   Anyways, I guess it is up to you guys whether you would like that
   stuff in there.  I just wasn't sure how many of you knew how many
   times it was in there..
This topic came up several times before, and the result is that
arbitrary censorship of code/comments is not going to happen.  The
only exception is in kernel messages which can reach the user in the
message logs, and those have been cleaned up.
