I think it would be best to code it in such a way that you
can mount multiple instances of shmfs, in such a way that
the differently chrooted programs cannot see each other's
shared memory. That should make it a bit more difficult to
get out of a chroot() jail...
(security buffs, please tell me if I'm full of it)
cheers,
Rik
