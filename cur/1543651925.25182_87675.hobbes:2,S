Thanks for the report.  Linus has asked for some changes, but has
ok'd. the basic idea the thread topic on linux-kernel was: 
"Re: [lkcd-devel] Re: What's left over." 
I am going to focus on getting those changes made, and then I
concentrate on why things fail in strange ways for various people. 
The primary change is that the mcore people need a 2 stage kexec.  1
load the kernel.  2 later actually start it.  This allows the second
kernel to be started when the first kernel panics.  Allowing for
nice crash dumps and perhaps some other interesting debugging
techniques.
Talk to you later...
Eric
