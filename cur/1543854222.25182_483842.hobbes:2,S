we can solve this btw; we could have a
#define THIS_MODULE_IS_LEGACY_CRAP_AND_WONT_GET_FIXED
that would turn __deprecated into a nop for those few legacy modules
inside the kernel that nobody really is looking after.
(and yes the define should be really offensive so that nobody will put
it in a maintained module, and maybe it should even cause the kernel to
printk something when such a module gets loaded into the kernel)
If this sounds like a good idea I'll code it up...
