My problem (Samsung P35) is that the BIOS wants to call code which
is no longer mapped because the BIOS is too big to fit into the
standard area. Since that additional area has been overwritten, we
are out of luck. Maybe if we did something like backing up all
untouched real mode memory immediately after switching to protected
mode, it could work. But I don't know whether that is feasible on
boot. Anyways, you don't want to run possibly buggy closed source
bios code in an environment where a single random memory write
may corrupt the kernel without debuggability.
And sometimes there is BIOS code which is can't be run twice.
Period.
Don't believe that one? I have a machine where calling EDD code
in the BIOS twice will hang the second time. See boot parameter
edd=off for reference :-(
So I agree that we could try to preserve the state better, but
I also can guarantee you it won't help everywhere.

Carl-Daniel
