Because of various reasons.  Normal kernel space virtual addresses
usually start at 0xc0000000, which is where the 3GiB userspace
restriction comes from.  
Then there is the vmalloc virtual address space, which usually starts at
a higher address than a normal kernel address.  Along the same lines are
ioremap addresses, etc.
Poke around in the header files.  I bet you'll find lots of reasons.
