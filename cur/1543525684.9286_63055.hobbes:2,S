I haven't yet compiled this patch, but will soon.
I have the following DVD-RAM device:
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 04 Lun: 00
  Vendor: CREATIVE Model: DVD-RAM RAM1216S Rev: 1311
  Type:   Optical Device                   ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 04 Lun: 00
  Vendor: CREATIVE Model: DVD-RAM RAM1216S Rev: 1311
  Type:   CD-ROM                           ANSI SCSI revision: 02
As you can see, it is detected twice, as it should be.  However, whenever I
try to write to the device(even using mkfs.ext2 -b 2048), it puts the scsi bus
into some unknown state(read, unusable), my other drives become
inaccesible.  Fortunately, I have reiser on them, so it doesn't take long to
reboot(I have to hit the reset button, as it can't unmount a non-responding
drive).
Have you seen or heard of any problems like this?  Note, the dvd-ram drive can
read cds and dvds fine.  Just can't write to them.
