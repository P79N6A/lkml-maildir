It might just be that not many are familiar with the code, or really
care.  If your patch really have 100% the same behaviour as the
original, and maybe some comments might be added as in how things
work, it can really help future debugging/additions/whatever, as
its so much easier (IMHO, not really caring much myself, but somebody
looking is better than nobody).  You might check with Andrew if he
wants to kick it around a bit in -mm ... ?
