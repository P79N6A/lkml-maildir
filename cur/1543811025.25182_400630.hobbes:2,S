no what you have is correct; the function to change this behavior is
called 
pci_set_consistent_dma_mask()
pci_set_dma_mask() sets the mask for the "data" (eg dynamic mappings via
pci_map_single and pci_map_page and such). pci_set_consistent_dma_mask()
sets the mask for all the "consistent" allocators.
so again your code is fine as is. If you want to explicitly set that
mask to DMA_32BIT_MASK as documentation that you REALLY want it to be 32
bit, that is probably fine too, but not really needed.
