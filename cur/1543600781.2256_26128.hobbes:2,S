Well.....
It looks like you are reading through some large file, then you write
to some other file, and when you try to read the file file again, it
isn't there for some reason....
Is there any chance that the file that you are reading from is being
renamed or removed while it is being read?
Can you try exporting with "no_subtree_check" and see if that makes a
difference?
Could you 
    echo 2 > /proc/sys/sunrpc/nfsd_debug 
and get it to fail again, and then show me that last hundred lines or
so of the kernel log.
