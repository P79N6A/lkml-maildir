Hi,
please excuse my lame explanation, but i'm not a kernel hacker ... i'm only
(stupid) user.
When i played with ISDN dial-on-demand combined with mppp channel bundling
kernel oopsed everytime i tried to reconnect the link with some packet.
Here are some facts:
ippp0 master, huptimeout 5 secs
ippp1 slave, huptimeout 30 secs
# ping ns.jhrnet.cz
<the interface goes up>
# isdnctrl addlink ippp0
<slave too ...>
# ping ns.jhrnet.cz
PING ns.jhrnet.cz (194.228.118.194) from 195.70.157.129 : 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 194.228.118.194: icmp_seq=0 ttl=248 time=238.4 ms
....
^C
<wait until ippp0 hugs>
# ping ns.jhrnet.cz
<Kernel oops>
Yes, i know that it's stupid to set huptimeout for slave larger than for 
master, but it's not good to get an oops anyway ...
I hope it will help someone to find and fix this bug (i'm unable to find or
fix it by myself).
Sincerely,
                   Wejn
