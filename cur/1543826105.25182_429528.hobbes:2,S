Subject: [PATCH 03/11] Cpuset: might sleep checking zones allowed fix

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
Fix an infrequently encountered 'sleeping function called
from invalid context' in the cpuset hooks in __alloc_pages.
Could sleep while interrupts disabled.
The routine cpuset_zone_allowed() is called by code in
mm/page_alloc.c __alloc_pages() to determine if a zone is
allowed in the current tasks cpuset.  This routine can sleep,
for certain GFP_KERNEL allocations, if the zone is on a memory
node not allowed in the current cpuset, but might be allowed
in a parent cpuset.
But we can't sleep in __alloc_pages() if in interrupt, nor
if called for a GFP_ATOMIC request (__GFP_WAIT not set in
gfp_flags).
The rule was intended to be:
  Don't call cpuset_zone_allowed() if you can't sleep, unless you
  pass in the __GFP_HARDWALL flag set in gfp_flag, which disables
  the code that might scan up ancestor cpusets and sleep.
This rule was being violated due to a bogus change made (by myself,
pj) to __alloc_pages() as part of the November 2005 effort to
cleanup its logic.
The bogus change can be seen at:

  [PATCH 01/05] mm fix __alloc_pages cpuset ALLOC_* flags
This was first noticed on a tight memory system, in code that
was disabling interrupts and doing allocation requests with
__GFP_WAIT not set, which resulted in __might_sleep() writing
complaints to the log "Debug: sleeping function called ...",
when the code in cpuset_zone_allowed() tried to take the
callback_sem cpuset semaphore.
Special thanks to Dave Chinner, for figuring this out,
and a tip of the hat to Nick Piggin who warned me of this
back in Nov 2005, before I was ready to listen.
