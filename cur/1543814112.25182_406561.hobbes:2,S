In a sense we have -- everybody should include <linux/interrupt.h> and
not <*/irq.h>.  Perhaps we need to poison the includes.

And if I read the driver right, is unnecessary code.  It could just use
the midlayer tag code (ok, not scsi_populate_tag_msg() which is
SPI-specific, but scsi_activate_tcq(), scsi_deactivate_tcq(),
scsi_find_tag(), scsi_set_tag_type(), and scsi_get_tag_type() should all
work, being thin wrappers around the block layer functionality.
