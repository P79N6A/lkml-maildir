Guess what, you _don't_ have to.  I have no less than 4 different 2.6  
debian boxes here, all booting the fully modular stock Debian kernels  
from software RAID on SATA or PATA (depends on the box).  Not only  
that, but I can shut down and rearrange those drives to different IDE/ 
SATA ports, then boot and it all still works with consistent /dev  
names (With the exception that I have to bump yaboot into booting  
from a different OpenFirmware path).  If you've customized and  
hardcoded a lot of the boot scripts, I can understand why things  
might be breaking, but the default initrds that the Debian tools  
generate work just fine for me.
Cheers,

There is no way to make Linux robust with unreliable memory  
subsystems, sorry.  It would be like trying to make a human more  
robust with an unreliable O2 supply. Memory just has to work.
