This is akin to the PPP issues, and all of this basically is telling
that the TTY driver's locking conflicts with networking quite badly.
In this case:

local_bh_enable() with hardware interrupts disabled, which is
racy and illegal.  Who disabled CPU interrupts?  Let's see:

And this is where the spin_lock_irqsave() occurs, that leads
to all of the trouble.
