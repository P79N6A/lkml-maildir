I double-checked the remaining CONFIG_* warnings in this version to make sure
that we are not dropping any warnings about actual bugs. There are a few places
where the kernel exports more than it should, but there is a lot more of that
without warnings, so that's fine.
The only places that believe to be bugs that needs fixing are in
<linux/kvm.h> and <asm-x86/ptrace-abi.h>. Avi has a patch for kvm.h
that in the kvm tree.
Below, you can find a patch for the remaining problem.

Subject: x86: export PTRACE_BTS interfaces to user space
The definitions for PTRACE_BTS_* are inside of #ifdef CONFIG_X86_PTRACE_BTS,
which means that they are invisible to user space. Remove the #ifdef so
that the interface becomes visible.
