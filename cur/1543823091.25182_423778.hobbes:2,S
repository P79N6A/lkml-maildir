My point was that if you changed slab to be a queue and not
reuse objects that quickly you could likely find many more leaks with 
your patch. It would make the patch more intrusive though and
slow slab down, so it would need to be ifdefed.
Another possibly less intrusive approach would be to use ioremap()
for all slab objects and hack __pa/__va to resolve it. Then you
would get unique addresses. You might need to increase the vmalloc
space on 32bit though. And ioremap again would need to be changed
to cycle through the address space, not reuse quickly (but it is
much simpler than slab and wouldn't be very difficult)
Using ioremap like this also has the advantage that use-after-free can 
be easily detected.
