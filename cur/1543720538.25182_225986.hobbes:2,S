I did not investigate this, but others who did think that it is not 
possible to create a segment that is reserve only so that does not 
unnecessarily consume virtual memory. Apparently ELF allows it, but 
Linux doesn't.
Secondly the amount of memory we want to reserve depends upon the PE 
executable that we want to load, so varies.  If we reserve only what 
memory we need, when possible shared libraries can be loaded at their 
prefered load address, and benefit from prelinking.

We are using a staticly linked binary (preloader) with a fixed load 
address at the moment, which reserves memory first, then loads 
ld-linux.so.2 and wine as the kernel would.
