PTY file-handle is full-duplex bi-directional thing, and sometimes
it may need reading, or you get unwanted deadlocks.

dup() helps you to have two fd:s,  fdopen() for both, one with "w",
other "r".   Things should not need that dup() actually.
Also fcntl() the fd's to be non-blocking.
Actually I am always nervous with stdio streams in places
where I want to use non-blocking file handles, and carefull
read()ing and write()ng along with select()s to handle
non-stagnation of this type of communications.
