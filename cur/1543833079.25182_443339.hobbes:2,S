Yes, that is true. It was just simple example how you can get simple 
sound effects without many lines of code. In case of heavy load or too 
many events in short period of time this method is not working correctly 
but this is not the main functionality of a window manager program.
Anyway you can aggregate events if there are too many of them and play 
only one sound or not play anything at all. For this kind of program
it is quite acceptable and not breaks main functionality.

True - and that makes things more complicated. I don't know if it is 
worth it just for bells and whistles. In other cases you do need to 
program more sophisticated sound support and RT thread probably will be 
your solution. Or some kind of sound server which holds your sound 
samples so you can fire them at the proper time.
ALSA lib is a low level library. Sometimes we need more abstract 
functions like load(s, "sound.wav) and then play(s) without bothering 
about all these parameters settings. So maybe OpenAL is a some kind of a 
solution but I don't know its current status.
