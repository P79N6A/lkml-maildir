OK, so is this the better patch?

I haven't played too much with the itimer, what harm can happen if the
timer is running while this is deleted?  [examines code here] This also
looks bad. Since the softirq function can be running and then call
it_real_arm unprotected! And you can see here that it_real_arm is also
called and they both call add_timer! This would not work, so far the
first patch seems to handle this.
