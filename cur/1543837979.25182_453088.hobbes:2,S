Of the 611 new lines about 150 are new comments.
Simpler yes, but also more complete; the old patches had serious issues
with the alternative allocation scheme.
As for why SROG, because trying to stick all the semantics needed for
all skb operations into the old approach was nasty, I had it almost
complete but it was horror (and more code than the SROG approach).
Why not SLOB, well, I mistakenly assumed that it was a simpler SLAB
allocator, my bad. However after having had a quick peek at it; whereas
it seems similar in intent it does not provide the things I look for.
Making it so and keep the old semantics and make it compile along side
of SLAB will take quite some effort.
