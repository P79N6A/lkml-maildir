Well, I can't reproduce any skips with my config.  That doesn't mean
anything wrt _your_ skips of course.  Maybe it's a config or hardware
difference.  With my 3GHz P4 low latency desktop full preempt setup,
ogg123 works absolutely flawlessly (using default settings) both in UP
and SMP configurations, even under quite hefty load.
I do get some ALSA gripes when doing heavy IO...
root@Homer: grep ALSA /ogg123.log
Audio Device:   Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) output
ALSA: underrun, at least 0ms.04:49.37  (103.0 kbps)  Output Buffer  12.5%
ALSA: underrun, at least 0ms.04:15.20  (102.1 kbps)  Output Buffer  12.5%
ALSA: underrun, at least 0ms.03:30.80  (126.7 kbps)  Output Buffer  96.9%
ALSA: underrun, at least 0ms.05:15.93  ( 99.9 kbps)  Output Buffer  25.0%
...but no audible effect whatsoever.  Heavy IO to my very full and
likely fragmented ext3 filesystem is a very big problem here no matter
what CPU or IO scheduler I'm using.
 
As I write this, I've got a heavy kernel build running, and was browsing
around with firefox and konqueror, checking mail etc etc as it was
running.  I definitely feel the load (no surprise;), but ogg123 is
delivering dropout free audio.  (this is the UP cfs-v6 kernel)
