 I understand.

 If it's the right thing to do, I'll love to work on that. :)
 There is only one problem though, I've never touched in the serial core.
It means I'll need some time to do it, and maybe the first tries can be
wrong.
 Any tips you have in mind are very welcome.
 Eduardo, let's do it? :)
