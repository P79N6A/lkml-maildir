Subject: Driver for Margi video card?

I have a Margi Diaply-to-Go video card.  I am looking for a driver for
Linux; I'm running RedHat's 2.4.18 kernel, but this is negotiable.
My searches so far have shown that there's an (unrelated) DVD/MPEG
type card.  My search found no other matches, either on LKML archives,
comp.os.linux.hardware, or google.  I suspect this means there is in
fact no driver currently available, but I thought I would check here
before I consider writing my own.
Please respond to fleming@austin.ibm.com.
Thanks,
Matt
