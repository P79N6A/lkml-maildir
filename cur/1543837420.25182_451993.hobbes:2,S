Humm, if we do not use dev_reserve_used in the protocols anymore, the
only place that still uses it is the fallback limit. If we could solve
that in another way we might be able to get rid of it all together. That
would save the pain of managing the accounting transferal on skb::dev
assignments too.
Daniel, any ideas? I'm fighting to stay awake... ;-)
