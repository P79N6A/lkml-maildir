i have been trying to understand how the system calls
are being made by applications and how the kernel
reacts to them...this is what i got into my brain....
when an application makes a system call ( for i386)
%eax register is filled with the system call number
and some other registers are to be given some
appropriate values..for example ..if i amke an exit ()
system call.. then its system call number "1" is
filled in %eax and the status code is filled in
%ebx...
 
so i want to know what are the requirements for other
systems calls to execute ...what all registers they
access..any documentation would be a great help....
