ieee80211_rx_mgt can do any filtering necessary.
Foreign mgmt packets, if properly used, can provide us with constantly
updated info about local wireless neighborhood: available Ad-hoc
networks and BSSes, signal quality of APs etc. Something resembling
constantly running scan. For example, acx driver does exactly this.
Note that typically mgmt traffic is rather low and processing it
(instead of dropping) won't add much overhead.

This filtering can (should) be done in ieee80211_rx_mgt.
