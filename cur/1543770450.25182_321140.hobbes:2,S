NCQ requires hardware support from both the controller and hard drive,
you can view Jeff's libata status page for which controllers support
NCQ. via do not, some newer promise do iirc. Some siimage and qstor
support it as well.
Modifying a sata driver to support NCQ should be pretty trivial,
provided the hardware supports it (and docs are available, AHCI is
completely open).

Legacy queueing doesn't require support in the controller, however it's
not worth the effort to spend time on that. drivers/ide already had
support for that some time ago, it was ripped out again because it
sucked. IMHO, the only queueing worth supporting is NCQ. Queueing only
at the host level will not buy you anything.
