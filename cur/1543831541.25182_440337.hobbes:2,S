Looks like D-Link is getting into the funny "change the chipset but leave the 
product name the same" game again.
DUB-E100 cards up to Revision A4 work perfectly, Revision B1 doesn't work at 
all.
The patch I've attached has the beginnings of a fix; unfortunately this 
trivialty doesn't fix it fully -- with the patch, the module loads, the MAC 
address is detected correctly, the LEDs go on, but pings don't get through 
yet.
After loading the module, dmesg says
eth1: register 'asix' at usb-0000:00:10.3-5, ASIX AX88772 USB 2.0 Ethernet, 
00:80:c8:38:53:a7

Chances are it needs some more messing with the .data and/or .flags 
parameters.
