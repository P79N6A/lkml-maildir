So, the PCI group should just have specified a 16 bit BUS and have told
that systems should implement some IOMMU in order to address the whole
memory. :-)
PCI was intended to be implemented as a LOCAL BUS with all agents on the
LOCAL BUS being able to talk with any other agent using a flat addressing
scheme. Your PCI thing does not look like true PCI to me, but rather like
some bad mutant that has every chance not to survive a long time.
