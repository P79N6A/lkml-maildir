    (c) do a simple "generation" script. This is what I'd do in the case of
	O_NOFOLLOW. In your makefile, just have
	   nofollow.h:
		   grep define.*O_NOFOLLOW $(KERNELDIR)/include/asm-$(ARCH)/fcntl.h > nofollow.h
The only problem with this sort of thing is that you need to somehow
find KERNELDIR.   Some kind of convention to make it easy to set
KERNELDIR, even if it isn't /usr/src/linux because you don't like the
history and because stuff you don't like is depending on /usr/src/linux,
would be really useful.  Say, for example, /boot/kernel-headers being a
symlink to the kernel headers corresponding to the default kernel to be
booted?
