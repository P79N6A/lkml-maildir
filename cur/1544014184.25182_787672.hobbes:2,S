List of 24 leap seconds.  Although the delta is 34 right now, the
first 10 leap seconds were done as tiny steps (~50-100ms) plus
frequency offsets.  Well, the first 'leap' was 1.4228180s on Jan 1,
1961.  Everybody assumes that those seconds don't exist to simplify
things (or that there was simply a 10s step between TAI and UTC on
1-Jan-1972).  The leapsecond file from NIST doesn't even have them.

I'd love that.  There's likely going to be some resistance to that
because the leapfile is available via the crypto-authenticated means.
However, there's no real-time information available...  Also, there
are many reference clocks that would need this information plugged
into it somehow (IRIG doesn't report leap seconds in any meaningful[*]
way, let alone UTC-TAI offset).
[*] Some IRIG extensions do support reporting leap seconds at the end
of the hour, but that's too late...
