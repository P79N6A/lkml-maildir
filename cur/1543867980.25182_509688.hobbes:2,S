It does, but I want to clarify couple of mements.
1. ret_data is supposed to be used by underlying kevent storages
whenever they like, so it is valid to put there device id or anything
else.
2. note that kevents are never generated at all - usage model requires
userspace to request some set of interests (lie notify me when tape 1 is
loaded or unloaded, notify when something has happend, when data has
arrived and the like), and kernel allows to mark any events as ready.
So if there are two tape devices and userspace asks 'notify me when tape
is loaded' and both tapes are loaded, kevent_s390_something_callback()
will be called twice, but for the same kevent - since userspace only
provided one request type - 'notify me about loded tape', so userspace
will read back kevent only once.
To get different kevents for both tapes two kevents must be provided
with different ids (but the same event number and type), and
kevent_s390_callback (which is called for each kevent in the active
kevent storage - for example in the driver for tape device) must itself
differentiate between marked as ready kevent and empty one.
So briefly drawing:
1. for example tape driver acts as a kevent storage for type 0x1.
2. userspace requests two kevents with id 0x100 and 0x200 with event type:
0x1 (tape event) and event 0x99 (tape is added)
3. user adds a tape, so driver notifies its storage with
kevent_notify_s390_tape(TAPE_EVENT (0x1), TAPE_ADDED (0x99)) - all kevents 
wich have the same (it can be a mask of different events) events are
called - kevent_s390_callback() is invoked for kevent with id 0x100
and (if there is a flag notify all) 0x200.
4. callback copies device id into ret_data for kevent with 0x100 and
returns positive value and sets some flag in private are to show that
this device has been reported
5. callback for kevent 0x200 sees that and return 0
or better do not set wake_all flag, so above steps will be done
automatically, in that case callback must check if kevent is ready and
return 0 in that case
6. userspace can read ready kevent 0x100
7. user adds another tape so we go to step 3 - things will be repeated,
but kevent 0x100 will be skipped (although callback will be invoked for
that kevent too).
It is possible (depending on callback written) that the same kevent
0x100 will be marked as ready again (if userspace has read it already).
