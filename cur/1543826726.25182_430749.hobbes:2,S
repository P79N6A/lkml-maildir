Right, I've been looking at this entry some time ago and thought that I
should send an update patch, but haven't gotten around to doing that yet.
Problem is that I'm not actively using this (admittedly historic) card
any more, so bug reports about this driver would probably have to be fixed
by the reporter or alternatively get delayed some time (I'm willing to
look into any reports, so status "Maintained" would still be sort of valid,
I think).
My currently "best" mail address is andi@lisas.de, not sure about
the validity of Jan-Pascal van Best's address, though.
Should I send an update patch (to -mm tree?), or do you want to do it?
