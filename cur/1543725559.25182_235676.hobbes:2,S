I maintain patches that allow building glibc on Cygwin and MacOSX.
The main patch deals with exactly this issue (S vs. s)
http://kegel.com/crosstool/crosstool-0.28-rc26/patches/glibc-2.3.2/glibc-2.3.2-cygwin.patch
I have to maintain it separately as the glibc maintainer dislikes the
idea of catering to Cygwin users (though maybe if I present it
as a MacOSX support patch he'd reconsider... naaah, probably not :-).
With the advent of linux-2.6, I also have a patch
to get kconfig to not use shared libraries (since I use kconfig
to help install the kernel headers, and shared libraries are tricky
to build on those two platforms).
It wouldn't be a big leap for me or someone else to also maintain
a patch to allow compiling the whole kernel on Cygwin or MacOSX.
If anyone puts it together, I'll carry it in crosstool.
