you can only do this if you use a virtual directory for dev, otherwise you
have to do something like scanning /dev at shutdown and storing the
result (this was the famous devfs tar archive of permission issue)
you really ahve two situations.
1. a virtual filesystem for /dev.
  this lets you notice all changes to anything in /dev and store it
apropriatly
2. a real filesystem for /dev with a userspace daemon to update it.
  this involves the kernel less, but unless you can convince people to
stop managing their devices the old way you have the problem of missing
changes
