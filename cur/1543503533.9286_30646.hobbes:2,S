I have one 2.0.36 machine that made it to 497 days before locking up. 
This is a high use web/mail/dns server, running multiple domains.  I
think the jiffies counter wrapped and the kernel could not handle that.
 And of course it decided to lock when I was out of town, so I could
not look at the screen.
