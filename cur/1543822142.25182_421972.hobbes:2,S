conf.c and qconf.cc do the same, it's a personal preference.

The check is not needed, the worst that can happen is a misbehaving 
lxdialog and you certainly have bigger problems than this, if the unlink
should fail. In the long term this should go away anyway.

That error message is as useful to the normal user as a segfault - mconf 
doesn't work. Since it shouldn't happen, this check adds no real value, 
the user still has to provide enough information to reproduce the problem 
and at this point it makes no difference, whether I get this message or I 
see where it stops with gdb.
