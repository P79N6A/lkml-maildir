Hi again,
Found the problem: I could reproduce the lockup with some simple
memory allocating code that caused swapping. After switching off
'multcont' on the drive in question, it was back to normal. (had
switched that on few days ago... I probably simply had not triggered
the problem right after that.) Sorry for the first mail.
Strangely, the drive states it is capable of
hdparm -m 16 /dev/hdd
as stated in the raw drive information:
$> /sbin/hdparm -i /dev/hdd
/dev/hdd:
