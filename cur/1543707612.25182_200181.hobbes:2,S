I don't think that this is necessary. Everything in <linux/> is kernel 
only. user space should copy the headers and remove the kernel only 
parts. kernel+user files mean that it's not possible rename structures 
or move them around. Perhaps someone wants to move all 16-bit uid 
structures into a <linux/compat/> directly - shared headers make that 
impossible.
I agree that the placement of the #ifdef is a bit arbitrary - it's a 
hint that the structures outside are visible to user space and must 
remain unchanged.
Christoph: I'm sure there will be users that must call the message queue 
functions directly from C code. E.g. the 32-bit emulation layers on 
64/32 bit archs. And they need the prototypes.
