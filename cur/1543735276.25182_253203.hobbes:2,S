FreeBSD's SMPng project is stalled for the most part and developers that
disagree with that approach have move onto the DragonFly BSD community.
It has a much more top-down driven locking system that's conceptually
CPU local called tokens, effectively deadlock free and difficult to misused.
It's already been able to multi-thread the networking stack using lock-less
techniques, while the FreeBSD-current tree had to retract their "all or
nothing" approach with threading their network stack. Jeffery Hsu is
the main developer pushing that subsystem.
