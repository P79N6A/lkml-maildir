So its something it doesnt do. Ok now the right question is
"What changed in ibmtr.c over the same sort of period".
Do you know roughly which actual kernel broke sktr ?

I fixed that in my tree. It uses udelay short short stops and schedule
for long ones

Well netif_rx is supposed to pass a packet up to the higher layers. The
board seems to be claling this. It also sets skb->protocol before hand
which is correct. The only thing I can't see is who sets skb->dev. It might
be adding skb->dev = dev before the netif_rx makes life happy - try it can
you ?

Interesting. I didnt know that. You have example non syskonnect cards it works
with ?
