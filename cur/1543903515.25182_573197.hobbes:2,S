Al,
I'm using the open/close call as a way for processes to register/unregister with a watchdog driver that I'm writing.
I thought that I can save the housekeeping within the driver, but it looks like It would be easier just to maintain my own list
and be done with it.

Not again...
There are other things that can keep file open.  SCM_RIGHTS, references
held by syscall in progress, etc., etc.
The real question is why does driver want to do that?  Details, please...
