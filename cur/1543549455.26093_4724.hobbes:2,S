Hi Alan,

i don't think that we can blame the disks! 
I have 3 different drives, which produce this error after 24 hrs under heavy load.
I'm very sure, that the whole IDE-stuff is broken under heavy load conditions, but i 
can't find out, what happens exactly in this case.

Perhaps some timeouts are not set correctly or the specs include some errors, but
it is very strange behaviour, that with kernel 2.0.36 there was never such a problem 
with heavy loaded systems and after switching to 2.2.16 / 2.2.17 the system dies 
after a short time!!!
I would like to help if i can, but i'm no kernel developer; all i can do is to provide
a very heavy loaded machine (video-sequencing) with three different drives.
I hope they haven't been destroyed by the driver, but i'm sure the drivers behaviour
let them think they have large amounts of bad blocks.
BTW: The drives were new! And checked... And ok with 2.0.38!!!!
Regards
