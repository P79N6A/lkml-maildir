In x86 arch code we would use __get_user for this (and we do in a couple 
of places). But it wouldn't be portable because sometimes _user is 
in a different address space.
Maybe it would be time to make a similar facility (read/write_kernel_safe() or similar)
with error return available to generic code? 
It should be easy to implement - iirc near all architectures already
use the exception handling frame work and it is a simple extension 
of that. x86 could just define it to __put/get_user
