When you use root-NFS, the kernel itself brings up the interfaces,
and IPv6 immediately comes in and tries to configure itself to them,
trying to create the routes.
Unfortunately, the kernel doesn't bring up lo first because it
doesn't know to do that.

This would be preferable I think - it certainly would stop systems
exploding when you take lo down for whatever reason, even temporarily.
Currently, if you do that, all your IPv6 local routes die off and
you're left trying to forward your own local address out various
itnerfaces.

Sorry, I don't understand how this has a bearing on which device the
local routes are attached to.
How come IPv4 can be happy having local routes attached to the
individual interface, yet IPv6 can't be?
