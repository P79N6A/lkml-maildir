So as long as the vmalloc'd memory fits inside one page, __pa() will always give the 
correct address?  If so, then can't I just call __pa() for every page in the buffer and 
get a list of physical addresses?  If I can do that, then how the memory be virtually 
contiguous but not physicall contiguous?

I don't understand what that means.
