Well, under most interpretations of the GPL, you are *NOT* allowed to
even _link_ non-GPL code with GPL code. (Basically, by distributing such
a linked binary, you are certifying that you have permission to GPL the
entire source-code and are doing so.

Who says that free maintenance and bugfixes *isn't* better for said
company?

We don't care about their secrets, we just want to be able to interface
with their hardware.  Really, we don't care how the hardware does what
it does internally, we just care how to tell it to do that.  It's the
difference between telling an artist to paint a big picture and
watching every thought he makes while he does the painting with a brain
scanner.

Should the end-users even *have* features such as sysfs and udev?  If
the *open-source* developers hadn't *opened* their *source*, then that
code wouldn't exist.  One condition they made when they gave that code
for free was that *only* people who also gave their code for free
could use it.

On the contrary, the zealots are what protect us from the even worse
proprietary software zealots.  You may not agree with them, but if
there were only one kind of zealot then the world would be much
worse off.
