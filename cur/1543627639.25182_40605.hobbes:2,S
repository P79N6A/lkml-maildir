Well, there *is* a partition table on the drive, but the byte-swapping
isn't handled automatically. Otherwise people wouldn't need to bswap
their TiVo drives when plugging into an x86 box.
Having the bswap option is definately useful. With it, you can "bless"
the drive and then mount the partitions and poke around. Please don't
remove the bswap option. You'll make life harder for a bunch of
people.
This gratuitous removal of features in the guise of "cleanups" is why
you got flamed earlier this year. I thought you'd learned :-/
