Right, thanks, because __flush_tlb_one opts out of the full active_mm
checking which goes on for userspace mms (which covers, for example,
the case of preemption before dup_mmap's flush_tlb_mm).
But is there actually a case where there's a problem?  So far as I can see,
set_pmd_pfn is there solely for discontig_32's __init remap_numa_kva; and
set_pte_pfn is there solely for set_fixmap, which operates on a per-cpu
area of pagetable, which would already be in bigger trouble if preemption
to another cpu were possible.
