Jeremy,
Good to know someone has read my email.
According to my reading of the code, it should only happen in polled 
mode, but I have only one week of experience looking at kernel source.
So it should be a work-around, assuming interrupts work on the parallel 
port on your system :-). It is an very vexing problem, as I'm sure you know.
By the way, LJ1100s tend to get page feeding problems about the time the 
warranty runs out, but HP has a free kit you can order to fix the problem.
