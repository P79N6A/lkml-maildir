Have a look at mplayer.sourceforge.net. MPlayer besides DLL loading also
features native Opendivx en/decoding, and native MPEG1/2 decoding.
Actually the tests were performed by the leader of the development of
mplayer, and he did compile the whole opendivx encore/decore code used in
this player, taken from the original sources.

Actually since the original posting, on the mplayer-devel list the
maintainer of mpeg2play (the portable parts of mplayer as a separate
player, w/o the dll stuff) also tested how well MPEG1/2 decoding works if
compiled w/ gcc 2.95.2 vs 3.0, and he was disappointed too, because there
was a slight decrease in the performanceof the generated code...
If you want proof of these, grab the C sources from the mentioned
sourceforge project site, and repeat the test yourself.
