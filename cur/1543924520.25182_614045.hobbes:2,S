What do you mean by "other"?  git doesn't have a monopoly, and the
kernel should support people using a reasonable set of version control
systems.  Supporting VSS would be strange, but nothing wrong with the
set you listed, if people find those systems useful.  It's not like it
amounts to a huge amount of effort to do so.
