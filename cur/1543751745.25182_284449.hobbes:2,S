[PATCH] USB: better messages for "no-IRQ" cases (15/15)
This changes the usbcore message about HCD IRQ problems so it makes
sense on systems without ACPI or an APIC.  It also updates the comments;
the issue doesn't appiear only with PCI, and with the recent enumeration
changes it doesn't happen just with set_address either.
