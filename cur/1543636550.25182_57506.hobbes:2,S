Hmm, I don't have that at the moment, but apply the patch and do a
build, and you'll get a ".defs" file for each .o file, eg
kernel/futex.o.defs which contains U and T lines (as per nm output)
showing what symbols it defines and requires.
Then you can do all the analysis you need 8)
Good luck!
Rusty.
