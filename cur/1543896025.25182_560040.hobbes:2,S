well, I hope to have solved c)... :-)

I must plead ignorance here, I'll try to fill this hole in my
knowledge :-/

Yes this would be an issue. By not knowing that, the queue limit is
basically useless. It doesn't limit very much.

Good point, the only report so far is DaveM saying git sucked on his
sparc64 box...
Dave, do you have any idea what caused that? could it be this global
fsync ext3 suffers from?
But the basic problem is balancing under-utilisation of disks vs.
keeping too much in memory.
