When I try to install with sound as a configured module:
WARNING: /lib/modules/2.5.55/kernel/sound/soundcore.ko needs unknown
symbol
 errno
This is new in 2.5.55, not sure where the missing bogus definition is.
It looks like soundcore.ko contains sound_firmware.o which is seems to
be more of an application than a driver (open/close)...
