I'm running a dual-proc AMI goliath on linux-2.2.1, with an aha-2940.
After several hours of outstanding operation, all processes which in any
way shape or form touch disk for reading (not writing) are suspended
indefinitely.
I awake, basically, to a load average that rises one for one as I start
processes that want data that isn't in page cache.
The in-memory system hangs for a short while after starting each process,
but for the most part functions fine.
Has anyone else seen this?
I'm somewhat at a loss for providing debugging information; it takes
several hours to arise, and when it does starting a kernel debugger
wouldn't exactly work.
