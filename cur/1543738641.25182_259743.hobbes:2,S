yeah, fully agreed. Right now the 90 locks i have means roughly 20% of
all locking still happens as raw spinlocks.
But, there is a 'correctness' _minimum_ set of spinlocks that _must_ be
raw spinlocks - this i tried to map in the -T4 patch. The patch does run
on SMP systems for example. (it was developed as an SMP kernel - in fact
i never compiled it as UP :-|.) If code has per-CPU or preemption
assumptions then there is no choice but to make it a raw spinlock, until
those assumptions are fixed.

what do you mean by 'it's difficult to tell'? In -T4 you do the choice
of type in the data structure and the API adapts automatically. If the
type is raw_spinlock_t then a spin_lock() is turned into a
_raw_spin_lock(). If the type is spinlock_t then the spin_lock() is
redirected to mutex_lock(). It's all transparently done and always
correct.

actually, have you tried your patchset on an SMP box? As far as i can
see the locking in it ignores SMP issues _completely_, which makes the
choice of locks much less useful.
