Would this really help?
When reading/writing files, most of the time is i/o-wait, isn't it?
Reserving the device exclusively seems excessive. How about
a quick test to see if someone else have been using it since
the last time your crypto-fs used it?  If nobody else used it, then
you don't need to reset they key and so on.
If nobody else is using the AES controller, you get the same speed
as with a reservation.  If something else is using AES then it won't be
as fast, but then the AES controller have been used for other useful
work as well.  Other parts of the kernel surely won't use it just for 
fun. :-)
