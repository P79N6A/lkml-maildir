Pressing 'ctrl alt +' and 'ctrl alt -' is enough. On Riva 128 cards 
rivafb uses 8 bit color registers but XFree86 4.0.x still uses 6 bit 
color registers.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This line indicates you are using rivafb in 16 bpp mode. Unfortunetly 
16 bpp is not supported by Riva 128 hw. It's a bug, in a perfect 
world rivafb should disable 16 bpp mode on Riva 128. In this case 
hardware is set to 15 bpp, but rivafb thinks it's set to 16 bpp. (Or 
something similar.)
Fastest solution: try using 15 bpp or 32 bpp.

If you boot with 8 bpp and you do not use X, console and logo colors 
should be fine. Please detail this problem!

Because you said yes to 'Processor type and features ---> MTRR 
(Memory Type Range Register) support'.
