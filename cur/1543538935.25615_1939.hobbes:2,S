   And the good thing is that we've already done that and it's already in 2.4
   :) It's JFFS, a completely log-structured system optimized for direct
   flash-memory access (no block boundaries needed, although it can work with
   blocks as well). Do consider the 2.4-port early-alpha though (made by the 
   nice MTD team) - the version that really works is the 2.0 version.
Very, very cool!  I didn't know that.  Sounds like very good stuff!
So does it do compression as well?  If not, please consider adding it,
as the iPAQ folks would love JFFS to pieces if it had that.  
(They're very space limited on the amount of flash they have --- which
is not surprising if you're trying to run a complete Linux operating
system plus XFree86 on something that consumers can afford to buy.....)
