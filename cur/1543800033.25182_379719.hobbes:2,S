all my tests were with gcc 4.0.2.

the two patches are completely independent, and the only reason i did 
them together was because i was looking at .text size in general and 
these were the two things that made a difference. Also, the inlining was 
a loss in one of the .config's, unless combined with the wider-scope 
unit-at-a-time optimization.
(there's a third thing that i was also playing with, -ffunction-sections 
and -fdata-sections, but those dont seem to be reliable on the binutils 
side yet.)
here are the isolated unit-at-a-time numbers as well:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  3286166  869852  387260 4543278  45532e vmlinux-orig
  3259928  833176  387748 4480852  445f54 vmlinux-units         -0.8%
  3194123  955168  387260 4536551  4538e7 vmlinux-inline        -2.9%
  3119495  884960  387748 4392203  43050b vmlinux-inline+units  -5.3%
so both inlining and unit-at-a-time is a win independently [although 
inlining alone does bloat .data], but applied together they bring an 
additional 1.6% of .text savings. All builds done with:
   gcc version 4.0.2 20051109 (Red Hat 4.0.2-6)
how about giving the inlining stuff some more exposure in -mm (if it's 
fine with Andrew), to check for any regressions? I'd suggest the same 
for the unit-at-a-time thing too, in any case.
