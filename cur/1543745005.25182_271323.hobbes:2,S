Well, there is one simple case that will trigger the Oops.  Send a
SEQPACKET to a connected but not yet accepted socket.  In this case
other->sk_socket is still NULL, and SELinux will deref the NULL pointer
in selinux_socket_may_send() when geting other_isec.  There is already
a check in unix_stream_connect, which is all that's used for normal unix
stream sockets.  But the seqpacket socket then uses unix_dgram_sendmsg,
so triggers the may_send check as well.
thanks,
