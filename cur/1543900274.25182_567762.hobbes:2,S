Thanks, I do know the kernel was tainted (Nvidia display driver). 
I didn't explicitly mention that in the report, since the kernel developers
see that from the oops message, and because I believe there is a fair change
that the hated nvidia module played no role in this case. Of course, there's
no way to be sure, as it is closed source.
I sent the oops message just in case the usb-storage / usb people can get an
idea from the stack trace what might have gone wrong. I believe it was worth
it even though nvidia module might in theory make the problem unsolvable. 
The problem is spurious (not reproducible). I attached and removed the Nokia
device quite some times today and yesterday without problems, and this only
happened once. 
As regards to nvidia being able to fix this problem, I sure you understand
that will not happen :) Even if it was the nvidia driver mucking arounf the
kernel address space, that would have to be very random and this oops
message couldn't help them.
