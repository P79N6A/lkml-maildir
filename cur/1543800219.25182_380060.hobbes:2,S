When I got bitten with this udev breakage a while ago, it wasn't a
matter of /dev/input/event? in the X configuration file, but that the
Synaptics driver directly searches for /dev/input/event?  files to
talk directly to the raw touchpad device driver directly, and fails to
initialize, thus causing the X server initialization to fail.  There
may be other failure scenarios, but this was the one I ran into with
my laptop.
