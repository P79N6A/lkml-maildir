Yes I saw that, but it would not probe my ST16C654 based 
card unless there was a specific table entry for it. That's 
why I thought something in there was broken. I will try again 
with an OX16C954 based card. Maybe my 654 card is weird.

Yes. Assuming an unknown card can get probed, the code that 
calls serial_pci_guess_board is definitely broken. At least,
the test for "no matching specific list entry" is broken. 
Do you know of any valid reason for the driver to message 
about devices that were found in the specific list entries, 
regardless of what the guess function detects?

If the settings were successfully guessed, why do we need a 
proper entry? Shouldn't the specific id portion of the list 
contain only devices that cannot be successfully guessed? 
In essence, shouldn't all "single bare UART interface" 
serial and modem cards work *without* an id table entry? 
That's what the older driver version does.

If we must log a message, shouldn't it be PCI id and class 
info about cards that did not match and could not be guessed. 
I think we are not supposed to do that because another driver 
may yet attach the device. (Somebody please correct me if 
that's not right.)

I already have your patch. Thanks. Yes, the "no matching 
specific list entry" test is broken. 
I have been porting the known patches to 2.4.19-pre2 and 
breaking them down to single ideas, and will start submitting 
them shortly. Everything will be on linux-serial for comment.
