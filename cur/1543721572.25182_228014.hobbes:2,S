The rename operation is guaranteed to be atomic.  You implement updates as:
1) create new file
2) write data to new file
3) rename new file over old filename
If the system crashes at any time you are guaranteed that the old filename
has valid data in it.  Even if you use data=journal mode while overwriting
the old filename directly you wouldn't be guaranteed to have valid data
unless your application was only e.g. writing aligned records to fixed file
offsets, and those records were <= 4kB in size.
Cheers, Andreas
