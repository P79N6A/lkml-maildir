kdb v1.8-2.4.5-ac6 works for -ac6 through -ac13.  None of the changes
in that series affect kdb.
There have been some significant changes to page I/O handling in
2.4.6-pre[12] which are reflected in the XFS CVS tree.  -ac13 is still
using the old page_launder() code which is not as clean.  In addition
kdb for Linus's and AC's trees has diverged quite a bit because of the
console and NMI cleanup in -ac.  Fitting XFS from CVS into -ac13 will
be very nasty, you might want to wait until AC syncs to Linus's kernel
or Linus takes some of the -ac changes.
