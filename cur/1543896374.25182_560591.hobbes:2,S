Tracking shouldn't be much more than seeing what different threads are 
about the same patch and then do more or less the same as what you 
called "the easy part".

It's simply how kernel development works - not by talking but by doing 
the work.
Many people thought long-term maintainance for 2.6.16 wouldn't make sense.
And I didn't start long discussions whether we need regression tracking -
I simply did it.
These are things that simply happened because I thought they were 
important - and because I got my ass up to do them myself.
Don't expect anyone to jump up to do it only because of your talk.
YOU must offer something, and it will work if it's then accepted by 
people.
If you think what you have in mind is both doable and important just do it.
You will find out where the problems lie yourself.
You might be able to prove me and all other people who think it would 
not work wrong.
You might fail, e.g. because people will not adopt whatever you have in 
mind because they don't like it for some reason, but that's part of how 
development works, and you'll never know unless you try it.
