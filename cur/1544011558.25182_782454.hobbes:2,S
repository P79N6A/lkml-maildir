OK. I do agree that persistent caches can be (sometimes very!) useful
for certain workloads. As far as I'm concerned, it is mainly a tool to
help scale up the number of clients per server.
One interesting use case that I didn't see David mention is for cluster
boot up. In a lot of the HPC clustered set-ups there tend be a number of
'hot' files that all clients need to access at roughly the same time in
the boot cycle. Pre-loading these files into the persistent cache before
booting the cluster is one way to solve this problem. Server replication
and/or copying the files to local storage on the clients are other
solutions.
The advantage the persistent cache confers over the two other solutions
is that it simplifies the data management: if you do need to change one
or two of those hot files on the server, then the clients will
automatically update their caches (both the page cache and the
persistent cache) without requiring any further action from the cluster
administrator. The disadvantage is that cachefs doesn't yet appear to
have a tool to select those files that are hot and are therefore best
suited to cache (please correct me if I'm wrong, David). The fact that a
file is 'hot' on some given client is not necessarily equivalent to
saying that it is hot on the server and vice versa. Are there any plans
to at some point introduce a tool to manage the persistent cache?
