I can't change your opinion but I can tell you a fact: this is the
reason that *I* do not have a copy of the standard.  If I could just
download it from a URL I would have done it long ago.  Not that I can't
afford it, it's just too much of a pain in the butt.

I think you are wrong.  No, that's too week.  I *know* you are wrong. 
If there was no cost in getting the standard every last one of us would
have it, the same way every last one of us has a copy of the kernel. 
Consider this: if Linux costed $18, most of us wouldn't be here. 
Charging a toll on the standard is just plain evil.  If ansi needs
money, let them get it some other way than by having a monopoly on this
public information.
Gack.
