Subject: [patch 3/3] Use BOOTMEM_EXCLUSIVE on x86
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/18/154

This patch uses the BOOTMEM_EXCLUSIVE, introduced in the previous patch,
to avoid conflicts while reserving the memory for the kdump carpture kernel
(crashkernel=).
The modification has been tested on i386.
