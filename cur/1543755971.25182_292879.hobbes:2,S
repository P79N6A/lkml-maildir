I'm running 2.6.11-rc3 on a T30 also with an intel8x0 card and not 
experiencing any troubles with sound. (Using Alsa, btw)  Did you check the 
usual culprits- that your modules are being loaded, permissions 
of /dev/sound/*, that the channels are unmuted, etc?  Checkout the thinkpad 
list too, they're always very helpful.
Good luck,
Shaw
