I've burned a cdrom in a windows program with Joliet fs, and now i need to
mount it in linux, but i just can see the files in uppercase. If i disable
joliet, i get a readme.txt file, telling me that "this disc can be only
readed in M$-Rwindowz", and i can't find no one option to convert them to
lower. Any suggestions, or the email of the mantainer of isofs (i also
can't find this. :(  )
Thanks.
