This is a kernel bug and I'm inclined to say that this has to be fixed in
the kernel and only there. If it didn't work at all so far nobody will
complain that it suddenly works with the kernel fix. It is an ABI change
but for an ABI that didn't work so far. I don't see a problem with the
simple fix to use __ARCH_SI_PREAMBLE_SIZE (4 * sizeof(int)) for s390x.
