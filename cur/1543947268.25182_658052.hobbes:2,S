If the driver could not handle zero length transfer, then the driver
should reject it (just like unsupported transfer mode).  Then the
behavior will be 'assert chip select and wait some time' or 'rejected
by the driver'.

I think my case is not so common.  But if the driver could support
zero length transfer easily, there is no reason to reject it.
And if nobody wanted to support zero length transfer on that driver,
it would be no reason to update it ;)
