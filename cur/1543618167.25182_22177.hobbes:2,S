This is not an unusual setup, but normally servers and
workstations do not need to mount enormous number of volumes.
So, I did the same because it's very useful, but I prohibited
~/.forward. Instead, requests for vacation messages were
submitted centrally and processed with the help of /etc/aliases
and automation scripts. This way mailing loops were under control,
and, as a side effect, sending something to a mailing list
did not require the mailserver to mount a gazillion of home
directories in order to fetch ~/.forward for each recipient.

Sure... The thing is, the 1279 mounts that I did is not
even close to being adequate to combat .forward or something
like separate mounted mail spools for large ISPs. You
really need 10,000 of mounts, at which point the whole idea of
anonymous device numbers falls apart.
