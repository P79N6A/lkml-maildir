Well, 0.10 works for me ->
Dec  6 16:04:27 videotest kernel: Intel 810 + AC97 Audio, version 0.10, 16:01:33 Dec  6 2001
Dec  6 16:04:27 videotest kernel: PCI: Found IRQ 9 for device 00:1f.5
Dec  6 16:04:27 videotest kernel: PCI: Sharing IRQ 9 with 00:1f.3
Dec  6 16:04:27 videotest kernel: PCI: Setting latency timer of device 00:1f.5 to 64
Dec  6 16:04:27 videotest kernel: i810: Intel ICH2 found at IO 0xef00 and 0xe800, IRQ 9
Dec  6 16:04:27 videotest kernel: i810_audio: Audio Controller supports 6 channels.
Dec  6 16:04:27 videotest kernel: ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x4144:0x5360 (Analog Devices AD1885)
Dec  6 16:04:27 videotest kernel: i810_audio: AC'97 codec 0 Unable to map surround DAC's (or DAC's not present), total channels = 2
Dec  6 16:04:27 videotest kernel: i810_audio: setting clocking to 41319
RealProducer finally works on _all_ codecs and _all_ bitrates, no more oops,
xmms works and artsd also works.
thanks,
