Widely known and reported problem with 2.4 kernels before 2.4.3.  Please
search archives before posting such problems.
Either apply Jens loop patches (available on via your ftp.kernel.org
mirror), apply a recent -ac patch (which includes Jens patches), or upgrade
to 2.4.3 (which also includes Jens patches).
Later,
Tom
