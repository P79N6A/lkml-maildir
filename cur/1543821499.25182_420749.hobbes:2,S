Subject: framebuffer broken in 2.6.16.x and 2.6.17-rc3 ?

hi all,
Sorry if this has been already covered recently, but it seems that the
framebuffer doesn't work anymore in 2.6.16.9 and 2.6.17-rc3, while it
worked in 2.6.16 at least.
I'm surprised noone has raised that issue yet, so I'm wondering if I'm
missing something obvious :) When using the fb in 2.6.16.x and
2.6.17-rc3, the screen stays just black, nothing is displayed... I'm
using the regular unaccelerated vesa framebuffer.
I'm wondering if this could related to the fb changes that occured
after 2.6.16 initial release and if other people are experiencing
issues with frame buffer recently.
Cheers,
Olivier.
