I have not seen it on UP systems either.  I only see it on SMP systems.  
After trying very hard last night, I was able to get my 4 x PPro system to 
do it with 2.4.0-12.  It seems related to loading in some way.  If you 
have more than two processors, the loading is less since there's more 
processors, and for whatever reason, it makes it harder to produce
whatever race condition is causing it.  I can get it to happen 
pretty easily on a 2 x PII system.
