BTW most problems are in thaw/resume functions. Both suspend and
freeze are pretty simple, and they both need to save device state. In
SCSI disk, it would be nice to save options set by sdparm. And both
thaw and resume need to be able to restore the device from both
"powered down" and "some state preserved".
