Well, several thousand or more interrupts really seems like a
regression :). But it seems that's the same thing as the “IRQ
spinning” (there was a thread on dri-devel about that).
It seems fixed with a patch from Matthew Garrett applied to
drm-intel/for-airlied but I don't think this has been applied to Linus
master.
