Reporting bugs individually, and with a bit more detail, has the
advantage that people can actually keep track of them and
recognize them; I highly recommend it.  And how are we supposed to
answer bugs that apply individually to kernels of unspecified origin?

This doesn't make sense.  Example?
     wait_for_completion(&vfork);
     if (unlikely (current->ptrace & PT_TRACE_VFORK_DONE))
            ptrace_notify ((PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK_DONE << 8) | SIGTRAP);
When the parent's vfork is done, the parent's debugger gets a
notification.

See utrace.  This problem is roughly not solvable using ptrace.

This is what I meant by vague bug reports.  The code for sending this
event is quite simple.  Things do get ugly when non-leader tasks exec;
I don't know whether the forced exits of other threads are clearly
visible from the debugger.

As far as I know I don't have this problem, on x86_64.

This is a known limit of ptrace.  It's discussed periodically.

See utrace.
