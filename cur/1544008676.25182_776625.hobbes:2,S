Subject: [PATCH 1/1] avr32: define __fls
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Like fls, but can't be handed 0 and returns the bit number.
(I added find_last_bit() to bitmap.h which broke archs which didn't
 define this)
