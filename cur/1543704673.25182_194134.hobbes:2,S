Yea ill try it right now. Ill get back to you in about half hour, probably 
less. Would you like me to send you a complied kernel or some files that my 
compiler has generated if its still crashy?
	I remember reading somewhere on lkml about another problem that hung RIGHT on 
boot and it was related to GCC producing an invalid instruction for that 
particular processor. This smells of badly generated code. Heres a recap of 
my GCC:
SuSE Linux 8.2
