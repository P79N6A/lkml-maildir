Thanks for the hints. 
However I actually wrote the swap prefetch code and this is all about changing 
its behaviour to make it do what I want. The problem is that nice 19 will 
give it up to 5% cpu in the presence of a nice 0 task when I really don't 
want swap prefetch doing anything. Furthermore because it is constantly 
waking up from sleep (after disk activity) it is always given lower latency 
scheduling than a fully cpu bound nice 0 task - this is normally appropriate 
behaviour. Yielding regularly works around that issue. 
Ideally taking into account cpu usage and only working below a certain cpu 
threshold may be the better mechanism and it does appear this would be more 
popular. It would not be hard to implement, but does add yet more code to an 
increasingly complex heuristic used to detect "idleness". I am seriously 
considering it.
Cheers,
Con
