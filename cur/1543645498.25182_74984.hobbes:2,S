Nope; This is the latest Asus PR-DLS dual Xeon motherboard with
ServerWorks^® Grand Champion LE North Bridge (CMIC-LE)
ServerWorks^® Champion South Bridge (CSB5)
ServerWorks^® 64-bit PCI-X Bridge (CIOB-X2)
And the Serverworks IDE driver doesn't see my drive.
Works Fine with 2.4.20-pre8
Who should I be talking to?
