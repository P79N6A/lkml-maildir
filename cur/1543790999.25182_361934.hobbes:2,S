I just isolated which patch it was last night so i'm still not sure which 
part of it causes problems. The patch in question is;
i386-nmi_watchdog-merge-check_nmi_watchdog-fixes-from-x86_64.patch
This happens on both a dual P2-400 and a 3.6GHz P4 with HT enabled. What 
kind of information were you after?
