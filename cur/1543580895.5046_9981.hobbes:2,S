Subject: [SoftwareRAID in 2.4.1] md_import_device() returned -22

Hi,
Could anybody please help me to resolve why this error is returned?
(md_import_device() returned -22)
I'm trying to setup software RAID0
on Asus CUR-DLS (dual channel ULTRA2 SCSI - sym53c896).
kernel is pure 2.4.1(SMP),
with devfs, sym53c8xx and raid0 support linked in.
raidtools are 19990824-0.90 from kernel.org.
Here is /etc/raidtab:
-----
raiddev         /dev/md/0
raid-level      0
persistent-superblock   1
chunk-size      16
nr-raid-disks   2
device  /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1
raid-disk       0
device  /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target1/lun0/part1
raid-disk       1
#same bus because I have only one cable right now :)
---------
And here is what I got with "mkraid /dev/md/0":
---------
handling MD device /dev/md/0
analyzing super-block
disk 0: /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1, 17921008kB, raid 
superblock at 17920896kB
disk 1: /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target1/lun0/part1, 17921008kB, raid 
superblock at 17920896kB
mkraid: aborted, see the syslog and /proc/mdstat for potential clues.
----------
And syslog says:
--------
modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module block-major-8
kernel: md: could not lock scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1, 
zero-size? Marking faulty.
kernel: md: error, md_import_device() returned -22
-----------
Is that "modprobe" line causing problem?
But I have compiled scsi driver in...
Or is that a devfs issue or am I doing anything wrong?
I would really be glad to get some pointers to the answer,
since I can't figure that out myself.
Thanks a lot,
Art.
