I should mention that I get exactly the same result from 2.4.9.  I hadn't 
tried ACPI before then.
On both my desktop (based on a SuperMicro P6DGU with the Intel 440GX 
chipset, l) and my laptop (HP Omnibook 450B) when I build in the ACPI system 
(either as module or into the kernel) the system hangs on boot.  It does 
this at the point of activating ACPI.  I enabled the debug mode and my 
laptop dies at:
ACPI Namespace successfully loaded at root c028a6c0
ACPI: Core Subsystem version [20010831]
Executing device _INI methods:.....................
(that's 21 '.'s).
Is there anything else I can do to help track down what's causing this and 
resolve it?
I'm not on the list (though I should start getting the daily digest as of 
today) so you'll need to CC me if you want me to see anything.
