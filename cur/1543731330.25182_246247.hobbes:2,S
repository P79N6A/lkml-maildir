The version of libata you have always reports errors -- be they 
controller errors, cable errors, or disk errors -- as either a read or 
write error.
Alan Cox submitted code that makes the errors more specific, rather than 
treating them all as disk errors.
You have either a flaky controller, flaky cable, or flaky disk, one of 
the three.
