This message got rejected by the list (now the patch is compressed). I
sent uncompressed in the original email because they are more handy to
read for other developers.

Subject: [patch] set_{current,task}_state() SMP safe
I produced a new patch to fix the wait-event-interface SMP-races. I hope I
merged all the good implementation-hints I got. All architectures will
need to provide set_mb() to make the thing working. set_mb() can safely be
implemented everywhere as I did in the Alpha port (see the changes
include/asm-alpha/system.h). That should be the obvious implementation. As
Ingo pointed out on x86 it's a bit faster implemented using xchg than
using mb() and that's why we have a per-arch set_mb().
The other thing to note is that in a UP compile __set_current/task_state
will be completly equal to set_current/task_state (and that's the real
cons against the raw mb()).
The old:
	current->state = XXX;
is equivalent to:
	__set_current_state(XXX);
The old:
	struct task_struct * tsk = current;
	tsk->state = XXX;
is always equivalent to:
	struct task_struct * tsk;
	__set_task_state(tsk, XXX);
Choosing between the old and the new style will make no difference at all.
The real difference instead is between:
	__set_{current,task}_state and set_{current,task}_state.
when the kernel is compiled SMP. The former will only set the state of
the task, the latter instead will set the state of the task and _then_
will force a SMP memory barrier.
The task->state is just volatile so no need of barrier() after setting it
on UP.
The SMP safe set_{current,task}_state are always safe. So if somebody is
unsure he should use it in the wait-event interface. In general if you
grab a spinlock between the set_current_state and the condtion-check you
can use the raw __set_current_state version.
Comments are welcome.
