Actually, no, it is the space preceding the open paren that is invalid;
see this patch for the expanded allowed character set in procps 3.2.5:
  
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/procps/procps/ps/output.c?r1=1.51&r2=1.52
When I discussed this with Albert Cahalan, he *strongly* objected to
allowing whitespace in security contexts, as he felt it would break
scripts that parsed 'ps -Z' output.
