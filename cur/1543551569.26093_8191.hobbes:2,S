Well, for sure after every dvb released (I have only one dvb card, the other is
one bttv), I got in dmesg:
bttv0: i2c detach [Philips PAL]
i2c-core.o: client [Philips PAL] unregistered.
bttv0: i2c detach [MSP3410D-B4]
i2c-core.o: client [MSP3410D-B4] unregistered.
bttv0: i2c detach [ir]
i2c-core.o: client [ir] unregistered.
i2c-core.o: adapter unregistered: bt848 #0
dvb: ARM firmware successfully loaded.
dvb: firmware = f0240009
dvb: MAC = 00 d0 5c 00 41 90
dvb: attach_adapter
i2c-core.o: driver unregistered: dvbi2c
dvb: 2 dvb(s) released properly.
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address d3323548
Maybe that's came from the way I autoload them in modules.conf:
#dvb
alias        char-major-81   dvb
alias        char-major-81-0 dvb
options      saa7146_core mode=0
pre-install  dvb modprobe i2c-core; modprobe videodev; modprobe saa7146_core; modprobe saa7146_v4l
post-install dvb modprobe VES1893; modprobe dvb-tuner; modprobe msp3400
# bttv
alias char-major-81-1   bttv
pre-install bttv        modprobe msp3400; modprobe tuner ; modprobe lirc_haup
options bttv            radio=1 card=10
options tuner           debug=1  type=5
Do someone know a good way to autoload these modules (and I don't want them to unregister...)?
Thanks you very much, and if I need to compil a kernel with some option less, just tell me,
and please, keep CCing to me, I am not on the list...
	Greg
