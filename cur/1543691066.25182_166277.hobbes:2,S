That's the point where even I consider such a system to be too complex.
If you want maximum performance compile a kernel specific for your 
system.
Compiling a kernel that supports more than one CPU is for people that 
can even live with let's say a 10% performance penalty.
If you want to run a kernel on both a 386 and an Athlon it's most likely 
non-optimal for both of them.
