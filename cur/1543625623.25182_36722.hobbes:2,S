Andrew,

Finally bit the bullet and installed Windows 2000 on the laptop. Now the
card works fine. This means the hardware is good (Thank God!), and that the
vortex driver needs to be fixed.
By the way, I contacted some of the other people who noted similar behavior
with this card on the vortex mailing list and they confirmed that their
problems continue. Being a developer, I would really like to ditch the
Windows install; how can I help debug this problem?
Thanks,
Rahul
