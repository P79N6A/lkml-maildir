Mmmh, "mount -o remount,noatime /" seems to Work For Me in Ubuntu
with util-linux/mount "2.12r-17ubuntu"...but then Google says [1] that
Ubuntu has been shipping with relatime enabled as default for months,
so it's probably patched (probably only in the kernel). So maybe upstream
util-linux hasn't merged the relatime patch.
