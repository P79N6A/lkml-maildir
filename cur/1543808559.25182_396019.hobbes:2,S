I've been unable to get this one working without reliably BUGging there. As 
soon as anything is prefetched, the next time ram is full it will BUG. So 
I've hacked a lru_cache_add_tail using a variation of the current 
lru_cache_add that uses pagevecs and it has been working flawlessly. I'll 
thrash this implementation around a bit more to see if it breaks and unless 
someone can suggest what I've done wrong with v24 I'll be posting v25 with 
the pagevecs version.
Cheers,
Con
