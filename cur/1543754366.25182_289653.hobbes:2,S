Subject: [2.6-BK-URL] NTFS: Fix a potential DoS by rate limiting printk().
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi Linus, Hi Andrew, please do a
	bk pull bk://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net/ntfs-2.6
This fixes a potential DoS attack in NTFS by rate limiting printk() when the
driver is not compiled with debugging enabled.  Thanks to Carl-Daniel
Heilfinger from SuSE for pointing this out.
Please apply.  Thanks!
For the benefit of non-BK users and to make code review easier, I am
sending each ChangeSet in a separate email as a diff -u style patch.
Best regards,
	Anton

   NTFS: Add printk rate limiting for ntfs_warning() and ntfs_error() when
         compiled without debug.  This avoids a possible denial of service
         attack.  Thanks to Carl-Daniel Hailfinger from SuSE for pointing this
         out.
