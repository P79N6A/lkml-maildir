Pity, I just had another reason to use this today (Checking if a network

We can fix that. Ive been avoiding it because it will take some non
trivial cleanup of our ppc64 time.c. Based on how often get_current_time
is appearing in profiles and also how gettimeofday has been known to
cause problems on large SMP (due to read_lock on xtime starving
write_lock in the timer irq) I think this should get merged.
