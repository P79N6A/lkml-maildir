Do you mean the vmlinux image ? That is not the case for modules that
were dynamically loaded.
This is when problems begin. If one loads a module that happens to be
placed in memory that originally belonged to the __init functions,
then /proc/kallsyms will still report them and throw off this logic. And
perhaps the original module file won't be around to try and get the
function sizes from it.
I suppose I'd rather rely on computing this size from runtime
information...
