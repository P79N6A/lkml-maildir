If I have understand the input subsystem correctly, for the
evdev X driver the mousedev.c is not needed, so using an
evdev X driver is a completely other story. This map change
could result that the BTN_FORWARD can be used as BTN_MIDDLE
out of the box, without any additional drivers, so it is
simpler (at least in case of Clevo D410J).
My patch is based on the assumption that every mouse has
BTN_LEFT, so it is not worth having two mouse buttons for
the same function. (For Clevo D410J it is actually an
information loss at this point.)
Next thing is that the BTN_FORWARD and BTN_BACK usually
comes together. The BTN_LEFT and BTN_RIGHT usually comes
together also. For the mapping I see some possible mapping
listed in the following table:
    Button name    |     (a)     |     (b)     |     (c)     |
    ---------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
    BTN_LEFT       |      0      |      0      |      0      |
    BTN_RIGHT      |      1      |      1      |      1      |
    BTN_FORWARD    |      0      |      2      |      0      |
    BTN_BACK       |      1      |      3      |      3      |
Mapping (a) would map BTN_FORWARD and BTN_BACK to BTN_LEFT
and BTN_RIGHT. Mapping (b) would map all 4 buttons to
different buttons. Mapping (c) is the current mapping where
the BTN_FORWARD is handled differently than BTN_BACK.
