Yes, I was wrong, I missed check_unshare_flags(),
	/*
	 * If unsharing vm, must also unshare signal handlers.
	 */
	if (*flags_ptr & CLONE_VM)
		*flags_ptr |= CLONE_SIGHAND;
Looking below,
	/*
	 * If unsharing signal handlers and the task was created
	 * using CLONE_THREAD, then must unshare the thread
	 */
	if ((*flags_ptr & CLONE_SIGHAND) &&
	    (atomic_read(&current->signal->count) > 1))
		*flags_ptr |= CLONE_THREAD;
Shouldn't this be:
		*flags_ptr |= (CLONE_THREAD | CLONE_VM)
? Currently it doesn't matter, but still.
However, I stronly beleive unshare(CLONE_VM) is buggy.
sys_unshare:
		if (new_mm) {
			...
			new_mm = mm;
		}
	...
	bad_unshare_cleanup_vm:
		if (new_mm)
			mmput(new_mm);
mmput() ignores mm->core_waiters.
No?
Oleg.
