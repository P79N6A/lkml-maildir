that is how FSF states it and it seems that most legal departments of
big companies (US and EU based) are not taking any risk on this. So it
seems that someone actually has to prove in court that these assumptions
for the GPL case are wrong.

Not even getting into this one since GTK+ is a LGPL based library. Get
your examples straight.

The GPL is a license. Nobody is talking about the copyright of your code
here. You always have the copyright on your code. The point is that you
have to license your code under GPL (when using a GPL library) and you
are distributing your code.
