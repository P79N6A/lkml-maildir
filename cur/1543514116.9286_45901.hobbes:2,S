Certainly that works today, since we know all PCI devices at boot time.
This will not be true forever.  I believe this has been discussed
before here; what was the verdict on "knowing" the names of hot-swap
devices?
Maybe when a module for a hot-swap device loads (responding to a
"modprobe -k pci-dev-fe1c-ee05" or whatever) it can augment the
/proc/pci table with its own __initdata.  (Who knows, by then maybe
__initdata in a module will mean something.)
