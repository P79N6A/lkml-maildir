PCI_MULTITHREAD_PROBE is an interesting feature, but in it's current 
state it seems to be more of a trap for users who accidentally
enable it.
This patch lets PCI_MULTITHREAD_PROBE depend on BROKEN for 2.6.19.
The intention is to get this patch reversed in -mm as soon as it's in 
Linus' tree, and reverse it for 2.6.20 or 2.6.21 after the fallout of 
in-kernel problems PCI_MULTITHREAD_PROBE causes got fixed.
