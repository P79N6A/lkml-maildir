Thanks to Russell for doing my legwork.
Mea culpa, I never thought to check to see if sgi had turned off pings.
They apparently have (bummer).
Sorry for the noise,

I think you're hitting their firewall.  If I traceroute to the same
address, it stops at the same place.  However, telnet sgi.com 80
"GET /" connects and returns data, so it is reachable.
Unfortunately, in this day and age, telnetting to the http port seems to
be a better test of connectivity than traceroute ever was.
