I got this new in 2.4.19, and my busmaster IDE doesn't work:
---------------
pty: 256 Unix98 ptys configured
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
idebus=xx
ICH3M: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev f9
PCI: Device 00:1f.1 not available because of resource collisions
ICH3M: (ide_setup_pci_device:) Could not enable device.

Yep, that's my IDE controller allright.
The machine kept on crashing on me too before I could get this to even
boot.  2.4.18 works fine and bmide works...
Likely I have a broken bios or something, but something changed?
Thanks,
