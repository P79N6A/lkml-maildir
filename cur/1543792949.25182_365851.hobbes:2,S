Without this feature, an application has no way to figure out if a given 
segment is hugetlb or not. Applications need to know this to be able to 
handle alignment issues properly.
Also, if the flag is exported via ipcs, the system administrator would 
have a better idea about how the hugetlb pages she configured on the 
system are getting used.
