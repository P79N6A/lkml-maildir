ok, agreed. Since kernel_stack(next) defaults to 'next', we go below 
that structure which has unknown coherency attributes. I guess the 
easiest solution would be to default kernel_stack(next) to '(void *)next 
+ L1_CACHE_BYTES'? That way the default prefetching would happen for the 
[next...next+2*L1_BYTES] range.
