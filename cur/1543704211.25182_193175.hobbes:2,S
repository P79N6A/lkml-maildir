Locking is not an issue. This is suspend-to-disk. Everything else is
stopped while we're working.
By the way, am I understanding the suggestion correctly? Do you
(collective) mean getting a fd for /dev/console from within kernel code
and using that? I've been looking at the way printk works and wondering
if con->write is equivalent (once I find the right console to write to)?

Nigel
