but when you are looking for this port, you would lookup which port it is, make 
something active on that port (if only a getty), and then confirm the port by 
plugging into it and testing it.
in other words, if you have a special constraint you will have to pay attention 
to the hardware to make sure it meets those requriements.
this is no different then the fact that many motherboards contain a 100Mb 
ethernet port as well as a pair of 1Gb ethernet ports. if you need speeds above 
100Mb you better make sure your useing the right port, but we don't name network 
ports based on the type of card.
