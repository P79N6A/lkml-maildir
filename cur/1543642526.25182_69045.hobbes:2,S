Except that for source RPMs sucking big time the stuff is REALLY cool!
I could also see benefits for other devices like HID where the current
ordering is done after a first come - first serve approach where the
minor device numbers follow the order the devices appear on the bus
which is quite easy to mess up and never consistent; Applying your
scheme to and-class devices also would allow to link whatever device
to a fixed device node which could solve many problems as far as
I can see.
Can you elaborate how you retrieve the IDs of a firewire or USB
controller?
