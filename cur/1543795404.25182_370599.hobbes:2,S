OK so the problem is only related to 29320 + aic79xx driver.

OK, I'll fully trust you on your setup then and won't ask you is the power
plug is connected to the wall :-)

Interesting, I've archived it. James presented it as a workaround,
waiting for something cleaner, but I've not seen any followup (may
be I've not searched well).

OK, it will definitely rule out bad cables and RAID array.

Often (in my experience), when different versions of a driver find different
error conditions, it is caused by timing problems. Perhaps the driver has to
respect some pauses on the bus that are not quite correctly respected. Have
you tried to lower the speed to 160 MB/s ?

Unfortunately not. I had thought about running a "verify media" test
from the adaptec bios on one of the RAID disks, but I then realized
that it will only transfer commands and no data, so the test will be
useless.
