Subject: Aironet driver version number?

I have been looking into the drivers available for the
Cisco Aironet 3[45]x cards and I have found several different
versions.  The three that seem to be the most recent are 
1) the "stock" Linux driver, from the kernel source tree
2) the pcmcia-cs driver, available in the pcmcia-cs package at SourceForge
3) the Cisco driver, available in the Linux driver tarball on the Cisco website
Drivers #2 and #3 have version numbers in them of 1.8 and 1.5.2, respectively.
The stock Linux driver seems a bit more recent than the latter two, yet its
version number is listed as 0.3.  Line 710 of drivers/net/wireless/airo.c:
> static const char version[] = "airo.c 0.3 (Ben Reed & Javier Achirica)";
Is this number inaccurate, or does it belong to a different numbering
scheme?  Or am I wrong and this driver is actually very old?
I would ask the maintainer, but none is listed in linux/MAINTAINERS.
Nevertheless I am bcc:ing the individuals whose e-mail addresses are
given in the source files.
