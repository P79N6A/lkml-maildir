well, there is no check in sysfs_add_file() (probably it should have?) 
for -EEXIST. Till
now, the dentry/inode for sysfs files are allocated only when
the file is looked up at the first instance. Where here (for relay files)
dentry/inodes are being allocated at the time of creation.
IOW, the check for existing files is being done at the time of
assigning the inode (as in fs/sysfs/inode.c:sysfs_create()) when 
someone looks for the
file.

hmm.. probably not, looks like it is needed. The extra sysfs_dirent which
got added in sysfs_add_file() will be removed by sysfs_hash_and_remove() in
case of -EEXIST.
