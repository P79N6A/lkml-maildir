Yes, even in the early PC-XT and PC/AT, where the DMA controller was
used for refresh, it was quite possible to reset the machine and
have RAM contents (except for the first 1 megabyte) remain untouched.
The first 1 megabyte was cleared, actually the first 640k, because
the boot code depended upon this. It didn't clear RAM used for
temporary variables.
But, now-days, you can't reset the machine without killing whatever
is in RAM.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
