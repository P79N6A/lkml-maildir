 :-
Users should also understand that IP Masquerading will only work out a
physical interface such as eth0, eth1, etc. MASQing out an aliased interface
such as "eth0:1, eth1:1, etc" will NOT work. In other words, the following
WILL NOT WORK:
      /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a m -W eth0:1 -S 192.168.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0 
      /sbin/ipchains -A forward -i eth0:1 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j MASQ" 
    what you're looking for is something called 'static NAT'.  netfilter
(ie: the 2.3/2.4 kernels) support this, IIRC.  unfortunately i don't think
there's a solution for 2.2.x, unless somebody else interjects here..
