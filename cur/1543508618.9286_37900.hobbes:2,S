if someone is trying to implement the API described in banga's paper, you
should send some e-mail to the authors (jeff mogul and gaurav banga) and
ask them if they have more research on this besides what is described in
that paper.  at usenix, i asked about some details during gaurav's
presentation, and jeff mogul hinted that there were some things they had
been working on (new APIs to support sharing the event queue over multiple
threads?) but that weren't included in the paper.
