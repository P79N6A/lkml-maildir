Does anyone have any ideas as to why this following 3 lines of code
don't work? The kernel version is 2.5.43 and I have several other modules
loaded before I load the module containing this code. From what I can
discern in linux/kernel/module.c new modules are added to the head of the
list to it seems that my code would work. Any help or suggestions would be
appreciated. Incidentally, this code is being called from the module
initialisation function.
    struct module *next_mod;
    next_mod=THIS_MODULE->next;
    printk(KERN_DEBUG"%s\n", next_mod->name);
