For "kernel.org" you mean linux kernel?
In this case: no copyright assignment is required.
The changes should be compatible with GPL v2
(as you will find i.e. in 
http://lxr.linux.no/source/COPYING
 )
You should confirm the:
"Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1".
This is in Documentation/SubmittingPatches
( 
http://lxr.linux.no/source/Documentation/SubmittingPatches
 )
Note: IANAL, and I don't speak for other contributors ;-)
