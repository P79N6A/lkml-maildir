In the meantime, what about a "running 2.6.0-test HOWTO"?
ie:
1. base distro you using right now for testing
2. which updates are needed for said distro (I assume modutils, any others?)
3. compiler to use
4. parts which should be abused without fears for data loss
5. parts which could eat disks, for those with separate desktop/test machines
6. whatever else you can think about
on a related note, from reading lkml I can see that in-tree ext3
is in good shape, what about reiser3 or reiser4?
