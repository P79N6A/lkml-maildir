That's normal.

That too, because of the earlier warning about overlay.

xawtv has a very short timeout when it tries to grab frames. It really
was made for TV cards, not webcams. You can either change xawtv's
libng/grab-v4l.c and edit the line containing #define SYNC_TIMEOUT, or
use a program like gqcam that is written especially for slow USB
webcams.
The problems with the other USB devices might be caused by the fact that
USB webcams will use all the available bandwidth.
