no, the hdd is a software raid 5, /dev/md0, which is piped through aes
via cryptsetup, so it is accessed via /dev/mapper/hdb (it is not
/dev/hdb, which you could think about the name, but /dev/md0). There
were memory problems, so the reiserfs got inconsistent. But it STILL
worked before I run reiserfsck --rebuild-tree! Just reiserfsck --check
told me to run this command, this is the only cause I run it.

Please tell me, what is dm-flakey?
