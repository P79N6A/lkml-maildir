Unless you saw this corruption immediately after a hardware-initiated
TTY hangup, my patch wouldn't have had anything to do with it.

And, because I screwed up, the patch doesn't have any effect on PPP
over async TTYs in 2.4.2, anyway.  The compatibility code for
pre-2.4.0 versions of "pppd", which was the real source of the
problem, was removed in kernel 2.4.2, and the patch has no effect.
The compatibility code is still in the PPP-over-sync-TTY code, but
once that's removed, we can back the patch out.
There are still horrible locking problems, but they represent a
problem with the TTY line discipline switching code.  It's possible
for the line discipline to be "close"d asynchronously by the "eventd"
kernel thread while other line discipline functions (even "open"!) are
sleeping.  Once this is fixed, the vanilla 2.4.2 "ppp_async.c" code
(i.e., without my patch) should be lock-proof.
