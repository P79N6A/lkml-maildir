Hi,
I recently added the irqpoll patch to Gentoo's 2.6.12 kernels, using this patch:
http://dev.gentoo.org/~dsd/genpatches/trunk/2.6.12/2700_irqpoll.patch
Since then, I've had a few reports of minor breakage, but this is the first 
one I've been able to get full info on.
Hans-Christian Armingeon (on CC) owns a a combined USB keyboard-mouse, which 
is broken when the irqpoll patch is applied.
input: USB HID v1.00 Keyboard [Cherry GmbH Cherry Slim Line Trackball 
Keyboard] on usb-0000:00:10.0-1
input: USB HID v1.00 Mouse [Cherry GmbH Cherry Slim Line Trackball Keyboard] 
on usb-0000:00:10.0-1
After the irqpoll patch has been applied, the mouse does not work (the 
keyboard works fine..!). This is without the irqpoll/irqfixup parameters, 
although adding them does not help either. No errors appear, as far as I can see.
The problem also exists in an unpatched 2.6.13_rc6.
dmesg here:

I realise that this is probably not enough information to make any sense out 
of! Please let me know how we can help further.
Thanks,
Daniel
