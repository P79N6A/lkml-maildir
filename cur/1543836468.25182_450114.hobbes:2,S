Sorry, the resource group - (formerly ckrm) series that Chandra posted 
a few months ago.

The point is that putting the controller back to the ckrm framework
would not be that difficult since it came from there.

I think part of it was the fact that the two main controllers
would were in scheduler and VM code made people to be
more cautious about the controllers and wanted those issues
to be sorted out first.

My recollection from the BoF is that people felt interface wasn't a major
issue and it wasn't discussed much. Most of the discussion centered
around grouping of tasks and the mem/cpu controllers and some additional
resource control requirements from openvz folks.
One way to go forward with the interface could be to request Chandra
to repost the ckrm infrastructure and see if the stake holders (primarily
container folks) can review and agree on it.
Thanks
