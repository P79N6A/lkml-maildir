Yes, but then the "modified through mmap" is transferred to the
per-address_space flag.  All this is already done by this patch.

No, I'm just arguing that your suggestion is actually a complication,
not a simplification ;)

Yes.  But that's not very useful semantic for MS_ASYNC vs. file time
update.
It would basically say:
  "if you cann MS_ASYNC, and the file was modified then sometime in
  the future you will get an updated c/mtime".
But this is not what POSIX says, and it's not what applications want.
For example "make" would want to know if a file was modified or not,
and with your suggestion only msync(MS_SYNC) would reliably provide
that info.  But msync(MS_SYNC) is unnecessary in many cases.

Yeah, we could teach generic_writepages() to conditionally not submit
for io just test/clear pte dirtyness.
Maybe that would be somewhat cleaner, dunno.
Then there are the ram backed filesystems, which don't have dirty
accounting and radix trees, and for which this pte walking is still
needed to provide semantics consistent with normal filesystems.
