1) 2.6.*-gitN kernels are automated snapshots of Linus's git kernel tree.
There is no coordination between Linus adding changesets to his kernel
tree and some script reading changes out of it.  (I could read your
note as saying that there should be some coordination, I suppose.)
2) Linus doesn't build i386 non-SMP kernels AFAIK.
3) The small bug has been discussed & fixed (several times).
