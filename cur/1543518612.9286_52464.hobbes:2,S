The other thing to consider is if you return time as accurate as the CPU
cycle counter, you have just created a mechanism for a covert information
channel. One of the things that surprised me was that the higher security
levels do not want a process to be able to get a highly accurate time.
If processes can get a highly accurate time value from some sort of global
clock, it allows a pair of processes to create a covert channel for passing
information. The less secure program monitors the time variences of the
high-security program in order to get information about or from them.
