This doesn't provide any really good place to put device attributes that 
are owned by the driver.  They can't go in
	/sysfs/class/pcmcia_socket/pcmcia_socket0/device/...
because the driver doesn't own the device.  They can't go in
	/sysfs/class/pcmcia_socket/pcmcia_socket0/driver/...
because they aren't attributes of the _driver_, they're attributes of the 
_device_.  And they certainly aren't class attributes.
So where would you put them?  You'd have to create another subdirectory of
	/sysfs/class/pcmcia_socket/pcmcia_socket0/
owned by the driver.  No really good name for this subdirectory spings 
to mind, and it's still kind of awkward.  But doable.
