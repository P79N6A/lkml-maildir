I think that, if speed is your goal, you should have the kernel
code use swap space for the cache. Look at what tmpfs does, but
running over top of tmpfs leaves you with the overhead of running
two filesystems and a daemon. It is better to be direct.
Maybe this shouldn't even be a filesystem. You could have a general
way to flag a filesystem as being significantly slower than swap.
