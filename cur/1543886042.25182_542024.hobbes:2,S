Note that all of your arguments also apply to the experimental
EABI little-endian ARM port.
I.e.:
1. The EABI port is an unofficial port.
2. The EABI port is not integrated with the Debian infrastructure.
3. The EABI port lacks security support.
You could also argue that:
4. "There is no reason to use EABI -- old-ABI works just as well."
5. "The perceived floating point speedups that EABI gives are
   completely drowned out by the slowness of the rest of the system."
6. "A lot of programs assume old-ABI behavior, it is too much work
   to patch them all."
Does that mean that the Debian ARM people have their heads so far
up their collective asses that they think that every form of change
is bad and are unable to accept that some forms of change might be
for the better?
I think you've just summarised why I don't like working on Debian.
