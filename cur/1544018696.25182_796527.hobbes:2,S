It's not just the linux kernel; grub also refuses to send anything using 
this board's serial devices, so I think the hardware/bios must be 
stuffed somehow.
And since this is an MSI board with 'Microsoft only Live Bios Update 
software (tm)' as the only bios upgrade option, it will be visiting the 
skip in short order.
I haven't seen this before; I hope it's not becoming a new fashion.
