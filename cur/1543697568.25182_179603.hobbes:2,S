Hi,
 I can attest a similar drop in read performance on a IA64 box going
from a 2.4.19ish kernel to 2.4.22. In our setup the RAID0 is LVM, not
MD.The RAID is used a a scratch device for a out-of-core finite element
program (NASTRAN).
 The setup is some 20 disks on 4 controllers. "iozone" read/reread
Performance went from about 400MB/sec to 260 MB/sec, while write went
up a notch. Unfortunatelly the read performance is more important for
the application in question.
 Due to the fact that I have no controll over the use of the system I
cannot make any experiments to find out what killed performance. Sorry
:-(
Martin
