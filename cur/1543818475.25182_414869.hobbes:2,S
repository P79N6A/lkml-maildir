Same patch as before now with better description added as requested by Roman.
Subject: [PATCH] Allow menuconfig to hotkey cycle through choices
If you have multiple configs inside a choice with prompts that start with the
same character typing the first character takes you to the first one under
the old behavior.  You have to use arrow or +/- keys to go to the other choices.
With the patch typing the first character will cycle between all the
prompts starting with that character.
This behavior has always been available in normal "menus" which are handled by
dialog_menu.  This patch adds the same functionality to dialog_checklist.
