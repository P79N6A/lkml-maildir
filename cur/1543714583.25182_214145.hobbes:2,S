glibc already strips the leading slash in userland.
If you want to do it in the kernel instead, it shouldn't IMHO be silent if it
doesn't see a leading slash or sees more than one. I.e.
	error = -EINVAL;
	if (name[0] != '/')
		goto out_err;
...
	dentry = lookup_one_len(name + 1, mqueue_mnt->mnt_root, strlen(name + 1));
