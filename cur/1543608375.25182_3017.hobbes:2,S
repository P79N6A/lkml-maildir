I've tried the patch you sent and it doesn't help. I applied the patch 
to 2.4.13-pre7 and it hung the machine in the same way (ctrl-alt-del 
didn't work). The last few lines of vmstat before the machine hung look 
like this:

I haven't had a chance to try my real app yet, but my test application 
is a good simulation of what the real program does, minus any of the 
accessing of the data that it maps. Since it's the only application 
running, and for performance reasons we'd need all of our data in 
memory, we map the "max the kernel will allow".
As another note, I've re-written my test application to use madvise 
instead of mlock, on a suggestion from Andrea. It also doesn't work. For 
2.4.13, after running for a while, my test app hangs, using one CPU, and 
kswapd consumes the other CPU. I was eventually able to kill my test app.
I've also re-written my test app to use anonymous mmap, followed by a 
mlock and read()'s. This actually does work without problems, but 
doesn't really do what we want for other reasons.
