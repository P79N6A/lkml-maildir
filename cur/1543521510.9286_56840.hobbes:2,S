Which BIOS version are you using? I have the same model notebook but I
do not see the message. On the other hand I am running a different
kernel and vendor patches -- 2.2.12-42 from RedHat RawHide. The
version of apmd is the same.
My notebook is using BIOS version 1.10; the latest version is 1.11 but 
the I have not found it worth my while to upgrade.
