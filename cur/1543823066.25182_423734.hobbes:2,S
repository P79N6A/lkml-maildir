The current patch for this is 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/work/current/2.6/2.6.17-rc4/patches/jmpbuf
I need to redo it, but that works for now.

I have no idea what these mean, but they seem not to affect the
viability of the resulting kernel.

This is a segfault happening when it shouldn't.
Can you disassemble stub_segv_handler and send me the output?  If
you're unfamiliar with gdb, it works like this:
	% gdb linux
	GNU gdb Red Hat Linux (6.3.0.0-1.122rh)
	Copyright 2004 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
	GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are
	welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions.
	Type "show copying" to see the conditions.
	`There is absolutely no warranty for GDB.  Type "show warranty" for details.
	This GDB was configured as "x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu"...Using host libthread_db library "/lib64/libthread_db.so.1".
	(gdb) disas stub_segv_handler
	Dump of assembler code for function stub_segv_handler:
	0x00000000601610c8 <stub_segv_handler+0>:       push   %rbp
	0x00000000601610c9 <stub_segv_handler+1>:       mov    %rsp,%rbp
	0x00000000601610cc <stub_segv_handler+4>:       mov    %rdx,%r8
	...
There was a bug like this a month or so ago, but it has been in
mainline for a while, so this should be something different.
