Point, but one that does hinge on whether or not you feel you can call using 
the ALSA or OSS interface an implementation detail.
ALSA has been the Linux soundsystem for a number of years now and as such, 
an application that runs under Linux and produces sound more and more can be 
expected to do so using the Linux API. The only reason it _can_ be seen as a 
detail is due to the Just Works nature of the OSS emulation but that is 
changing due to the software mixing. Binary apps are also moving to ALSA 
currently, ie, flash, skype, ...
Anyways, I suspect at least Takashi Iwai would simply say "no" to removing 
or deprecating the in kernel emulation anyway, although it's not likely to 
grow features anymore.
Rene.
