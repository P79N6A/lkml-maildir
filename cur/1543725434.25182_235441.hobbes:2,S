that's bad news.
VIA markets those mini-itx mainboards (with onboard audio/video/network) 
as multimedia appliances and
therefore I'd expect the hardware providing low latencies  when both 
video acceleration and audio is used.
Hopefully only a driver issue (as in most of cases)
Since VIA released the unichrome (the gfx chipset contained in their 
mainboards) sources someone should
contact these folks :
http://unichrome.sourceforge.net/
to check what is causing those latency spikes ?
Any unichrome developer lurking on LKML ?
cheers,
Benno
