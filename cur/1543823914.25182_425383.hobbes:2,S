It sounds like that feature might be the
most-likely-to-cause-maintainer-revolt one, in which case yes, it is
absolutely definitely the one to start with.

this feature is compulsory for any sane virtualisation implementation then
that's it - game over.  We want to discover such blockers as early in the
process as possible.
