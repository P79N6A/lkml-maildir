I have to agree with Christoph. The priority here is breaking down the
BKL and document all the things being protected by it and we've got a
reasonably obvious patch in that direction. Meanwhile, there's not
currently a pressing demand to make fasync in particular scale that I'm
aware of.
Having a single big lock here is quite possibly something we'll want to
fix down the road, agreed, but until we can actually measure it hurting
us, debating about whether to use a bit lock or reuse an existing lock
or add a new lock to all struct files is a bit premature.
