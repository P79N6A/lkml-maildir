dev->flags cannot be changed by interrupts,
it contains only static and administratively set flags.
Othewise we will have to spinlock or atomize all the accesses
to them.
Link state flag must be separate. dev->link_state or a bit
in atomic flag bitset. It may be translated to IFF_RUNNING
by ioctl frontend though.
BTW teql is insensitive to link state, it does NUD.
