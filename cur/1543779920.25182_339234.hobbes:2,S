Hello again,
here's the solution.  The x86_64 specific portion will be posted as a
separate patch.

I'm getting a BUG in mm/memory.c:985.  The unexpected value is 18 or
VM_FAULT_MINOR|VM_FAULT_WRITE.  As it turns out, __handle_mm_fault()
never returns VM_FAULT_WRITE, but in combination with VM_FAULT_MINOR.
Apparently, that's what was meant, and the fallthrough to case
VM_FAULT_MINOR is an indication of that.
