Thanks for the pointers to Ralf Brown's interrupt page.

Sure. I'm a novice at both the x86 instruction set and the GNU assembler
and I'm just trying to understand the reason the code is written the way
it is.

I looked at one place where these words are used: the read_track routine.
Part of that code looks like this:
-------------------------------
	movw	4(%si), %dx		# 4(%si) = track
	movw	(%si), %cx		# (%si)  = sread
	incw	%cx
	movb	%dl, %ch
	movw	2(%si), %dx		# 2(%si) = head
	movb	%dl, %dh
	andw	$0x0100, %dx
	movb	$2, %ah
---------------------------------
If this code is rewritten to use byte instructions (and sread, head, track
are changed to .byte instead of .word) like so (the last two instructions
are unchanged):
-----------------------------------------------
	movb	(%si), %cl		# (%si)  = sread
	incb	%cl
	movb	2(%si), %ch		# 2(%si) = track
	movb	1(%si), %dh		# 1(%si) = head
	andw	$0x0100, %dx
	movb	$2, %ah
------------------------------------------------
there is a net saving of 6 bytes. (I compiled this with "gcc -c", linked
with "ld --oformat binary -Ttext 0x0" and compared the size of the results).
I'm not proposing this as a fix BTW; just an academic exercise, really.
