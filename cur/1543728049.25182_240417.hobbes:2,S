In principle you're right. But as we don't really now how much resources 
the installed hotplug program will require I don't really see another way.

But then you'll lose all events which happen in the meantime.
The dynamic setting is mainly intended for two scenarios:
- Booting. You can disable all events on boot with the kernel 
commandline and re-enable them once your hotplug subsystem is up and 
running. This way you can handle all (ok, all devices appearing in 
sysfs) device with hotplug events; there is no need to regenerate / fake 
all events which might have been missed. Currently you need two sets of 
scripts, one for configuring all devices until hotplug is running and 
another one used by hotplug.
- Debugging. Especially laptops or legacy free machines do have the 
problem that hotplug scripts might misconfigure the machine, e.g. by 
loading the wrong module. Of course it's possible to keep this 'disable 
hotplug events on request' (which should event available during boot) 
entirely in userspace. But it would increase the size of /sbin/hotplug 
(and hence the running time) by quite a bit; and this would bite us on 
every hotplug event generated resulting in a general slowdown of the 
hotplug subsystem. If we can stop the hotplug event delivery from within 
the kernel, we can keep the main hotplug script as small as possible 
while retaining the functionality of temporarily disabling all hotplug 
events.
What we could do, though, is to implement two semaphores, one for kmod 
calls and another one for hotplug calls. Then we can queue or event 
delay all hotplug events while any kmod call would just be blocked until 
the semaphore is free again.
Better approach?
Cheers,
Hannes
