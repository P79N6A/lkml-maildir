User I/O:   sys_write->sd_raw_fops.write->sd_raw_write->sd_raw_rw
Kernel I/O:    vmdump->sd_raw_fops.write->sd_raw_write->sd_raw_rw
In SGI's 2.2.13 patch, sd_raw_write allocates the kiobuf, sd_raw_rw
maps and unmaps it so sd_raw_rw has to know what type of pages are
being used.  In my 2.3.26 version, sd_raw_write allocates, maps and
unmaps the kiobuf, sd_raw_rw just uses whatever pages are in the
kiobuf.  My version sets up user or kernel mappings depending on the
filp, or it would if I knew how to complete map_kernel_kiobuf().  SCT
is redoing kiobuf mappings so I am waiting on that change.
