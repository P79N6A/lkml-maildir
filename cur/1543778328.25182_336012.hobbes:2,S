Hi All,
  I would like to rescind the patch that was posted here on Jul 19, 2005
with the subject [PATCH] jsm driver - Linux-2.6.12.3, since I am
submitting the patch against development kernel-2.6.13-rc3. The patch
takes care of the major device number change. A full description of the
change is given below.
  In the kernel-2.6.12.3 version, the jsm driver uses a static number of
253.  The major number 253 is a reserved for "LOCAL/EXPERIMENTAL USE" by
both char and block devices.  So the current patch takes advantage of
the dynamic allocation of major number by the kernel.
  Please CC me your comments.  Thanks.
