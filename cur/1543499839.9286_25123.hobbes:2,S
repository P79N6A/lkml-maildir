The problem with devfs, IMVHO, is that it solves the _easy_ half of the
problem. The _hard_ part is permission management (includes persistence,
default permissions, etc). And at least default permission management is
_policy_ and DOES NOT belong into the kernel.
Sure, the current way of creating entries in /dev for 8 IDE disks (or is it
16 now?) and assorted SCSI devices is dumb, but it has the virtue that
permissions (even for now-nonexistent devices that might appear tomorrow)
are handled by exactly the same mechanisms and tools as everywhere else.
Plus it shouldn't be hard to write a script that cleans out what isn't used.
OTOH, it is not exactly a hundred times daily that I add a device. To mess
with everything else just for the sake of making an operation the average
user does _once_ easier is ridiculous.
