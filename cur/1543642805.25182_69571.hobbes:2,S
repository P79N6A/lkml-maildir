It could make a noise, but it will still be a failure.  Once you've
unregistered one of the module's resources (e.g. a PCI device
registration), there is no turning back.  If the next thing you
unregister (e.g. a filesystem) fails, what are you going to do?  Try to
re-register the PCI device?
Basically, once you've started unregistering resources, if there's an
error you're left in an inconsistent state.  You can try to get back to
one of the states "module installed" or "module removed", but there's no
guarantee of either -- and trying to do that would certainly complicated
cleanup_module() functions.

Please say if you mean "cleanup_module()" when you say "__exit".
Assuming you do, how can __exit safely decide whether to return 0 or -1?

Then you've completely confused me, because you seem to be saying that a
module's own cleanup function returns a success/failure result to the
module subsystem.  Or is that not what you mean when you say __exit?
(Which isn't the name of a function, btw).

I'm sure there would be no harm in cleanup_module() returning an error
code, but if it did all we could do is log it.

Well it's not obvious, because either I don't understand what you are
describing, or you don't understand when I explain that it doesn't work :-)

You have to increment the preempt counter in the threads, not in the
path that's testing for a quiescent state, so that when a thread does
set_finished_flag/dec_ref_count -> unlock -> exit, there can be no
preempt between the unlock and the exit.
This is all made simpler by using complete_and_exit() these days.

Well, first can you please explain what you mean by "calling __exit"?
Do you mean "calling cleanup_module()", which is the the function in a
module that's declared using the `module_exit' macro?
If so then I maintain there are non-trivial races that bite nearly every
use of MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT from within the module.
