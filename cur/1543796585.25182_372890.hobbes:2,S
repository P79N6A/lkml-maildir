.. and it doesn't look like the Xorg people are willing/able to do
something against that: witness the current thread named "Official
method for determining modular X module path?" on Xorg's mailing-list
which deals *exactely* with Arjan's theoretical problems of
cross-distributions modules compatibility, with the same pragmatism that
made Linus choose Bitkeeper. 
As one can consider Xorg as being a device driver, albeit in userspace,
you see that the 3D part isn't going up any time soon.
