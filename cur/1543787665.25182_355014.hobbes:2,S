I see. And when EDID is enabled for the module, it won't let me touch
those timings at all. Maybe a "noddc" or "noedid" module option for
when EDID support is compiled in and one wants to work without it?

Yes, after I got the idea that came as an obvious conclusion ... maybe
this should be a FAQ? Documented in the help for fbmod?

Yep, and as I already said it's a known problem with my configuration
(it's not clear whether the problem is the video card, with the
montitor, or somewhere inbetween).

That'd be nice.

Given that nvidiafb manages to read the edid and rivafb doesn't, I
would say so too :) maybe get-edid needs fixes in that direction too?
Anyway, it looks like I won't have problems using nvidiafb at 16 bits
depth without EDID for the moment ... can I still use X.org's nv at 24
bits at the same time? Can they cooperate on the framebuffer? IIRC
there was an option to let nv use the Linux-managed framebuffer ...
Oh yes:
"""
	Option		"UseFBDev"		"true" 
"""
Will this create problems when the FBDev is at a different bitdepth?
WIll this slow down either of the sides?
