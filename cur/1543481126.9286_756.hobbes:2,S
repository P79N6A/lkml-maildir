In: 
   Microsoft engineers Josh Cohen and Vinod Valloppillil, in a
   competitive examination of Linux (Halloween Document,
   <
http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html>,
 wrote that "Linux
   represents a best-of-breed UNIX, that is trusted on mission
   critical applications, and - due to its open source code - has a
   long term credibility which excedes many other competitive
   operating systems."
you should probably change "Microsoft engineers" to something else.
It sounds too much like Microsoft Certified Engineer", as in MSCE,
which is just a certification that anyone can get (after passing some
tests).
