Should we do something like:
 1) identify the hot write spots, to arrange them by access pattern,
	as Christoph considered, in another reply on this thread.
 2) identify the hot read, cold write spots, to bunch them up away from (1)
 3) leave the rest as "inert filler" (aka "cannon fodder", in my previous
	reply), but unmarked in any case.
 4) change the word "__read_mostly" to "__hot_read_cold_write", to more
	accurately fit item (2).
