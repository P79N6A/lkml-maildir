thanks Gautham, the patchset from you and Paul looks good to me and i've 
applied it to sched-devel.git to get it tested and reviewed some more.
from the Nitpicking Police, there are a couple of minor style 
problems/warnings with the code, you can see it via:
  scripts/checkpatch.pl --file kernel/rcu*.c
nothing serious - RCU is still one of the cleanest subsystems in the 
kernel:
                                      errors   lines of code   errors/KLOC
kernel/rcuclassic.c                        0             575             0
kernel/rcupdate.c                          1             138           7.2
kernel/rcupreempt.c                        0             953             0
kernel/rcupreempt_trace.c                  0             330             0
kernel/rcutorture.c                        8             995           8.0
the eventual goal would be to match:
   scripts/checkpatch.pl --file kernel/sched*.[ch]
output ;-)
