It currently uses both :
It uses alloc_page and vmap to allocate the buffers and it uses
kzalloc/kmalloc to allocate the relay structures.

Then I guess we would depend on page_alloc_init(). It's not that bad,
but I guess the question is : do we prefer to let users specify the
buffer size to reserve for tracing on the kernel command line (that
would require __get_free_pages()) or do we compile-in a static buffer
size, which can be specified in the kernel configuration. I think
providing both could be an option : flexibility _and_ *very* early
tracing.
So making this relay interface flexible enough to receive a buffer
either reserved by __get_free_pages() or a static buffer seems like a
good compromise. It would also have to receive the buffer size from the
caller.

As far as I am concerned, I can only merge this in the LTTng project to
try it. I've added Tom Zanussi, the author of relay, who might have some
ideas to share with us. I would wait until we have a more precise idea
of the API before I modify LTTng to start using it.
