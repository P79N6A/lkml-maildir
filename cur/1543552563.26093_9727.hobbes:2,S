Please don't do this!  First of all, expect other CPU vendors to come
out with this.  Hardcoding vendor == INTEL all over the place is an
EXTREMELY bad idea, especially for a feature such as FXSR and XMM,
which are inevitable going to be used elsewhere.
Unfortunately, especially AMD has in the past made the mistake of
reassigning Intel-defined bits (in 0x00000001) for their own use;
these should be treated as AMD-specific bugs and handled as such;
rather than saying "everything that isn't Intel is buggy."  Similarly,
Intel CPUID errors such as the early P6 SEP bugs should be treated as
Intel-specific, of course.
I would really like to see the current 1:1 mapping between CPUID
00000001:EDX and the x86 feature flags Linux uses to go away, to be
replaced with a Linux-defined structure that is filled by the
CPU-detection code.  However, I *FIRMLY* believe that *UNLESS
OTHERWISE KNOWN* (due to vendor-specific bugs/quirks/whatever), the
default is that feature flags in 00000001:EDX, if present, should be
as defined by Intel, feature flags in 80000001:EDX, if present, should
be as defined by AMD, and feature flags in 80860001:EDX, if present,
should be as defined by Transmeta; this should *NOT* be
conditionalized on the VendorID.
We probably need more than 32 bits worth of feature test bits to cover
all current x86 processors; and definitely for the future.  I'd like
to suggest making the feature flag set an array of longs, with the
appropriate defines.
