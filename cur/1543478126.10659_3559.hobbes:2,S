I noticed this problem with 2.2.0-pre6, and figured *somebody* must have 
noticed it.  Apparently not -- I patched up to pre7 tonight, and the
problems are still there.  I notice several things wrong with "make
xconfig":
  * a bunch of warnings of the form
      WARNING - broken Config.in!  CONFIG_XXX was not declared!
    which appear in small flurries when I enter certain subsystem
    configuration dialogue boxes.  Ask me if you want details.
  * one of these warnings is more broken-looking than the others:
      WARNING - broken Config.in!  m was not declared!
  * when you use the "Next" button to iterate across all subsystems
    dialogues it even takes you into the dialogues that are greyed-out
    on the main menu -- shouldn't these be skipped?
  * one of those greyed-out-but-nevertheless-accessible dialogues
    is "Mice", which mysteriously contains a question about
    "QIC-02 tape support" and another about "Watchdog Timer Support". 
    I don't know much about hardware or kernel device drivers, but
    I'm pretty sure that a QIC-02 tape drive != a mouse (even if
    it is a bus mouse)
But apart from those little gripes, "make xconfig" is as wonderful as it
has been since it first appeared.  Thanks to whoever took the time.
        Greg
