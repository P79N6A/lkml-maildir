I have the following warning:
drivers/rtc/interface.c: In function 'rtc_set_mmss':
drivers/rtc/interface.c:91: warning: 'old.tm_hour' is used uninitialized in this function
drivers/rtc/interface.c:91: warning: 'old.tm_min' is used uninitialized in this function
The following patch fixes it (maybe using goto would be better and avoid
having lines > 80 chars).
