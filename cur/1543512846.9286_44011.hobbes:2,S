I see, this can prevent the value free from being negative, but
shortage of nr_free_pages is still exist.
 After my previous posting, we found the fundamental reason which
cause the trouble.
About weeks ago, I posted the memory page initialization bug in
mem_init() of linux-2.3.21/arch/i386/mm/init.c.
It had been fixed in 2.3.19. But 2^32 wraparound bug exists in
mem_init() function.
The following patch will fix it.  This patch also prevents miss
recognition of blocks with start address overflowed.  which will
happens if a memory block starting at physical address 0x40000000
(1GB), the resulting 'PAGE_ OFFSET + addr' wraps around to lower
address.

In our original situation, our machine has a block starting at 64MB
which ends at 2GB.  The original for statement is not executed because:
	addr= PAGE_OFFSET+64MB
	end= PAGE_OFFSET+2GB
 With PAGE_OFFSET = 0xc0000000, end overflows and the condition (addr
< end) is always false.  Being ignored this block causes the shotage
of memory.
This problem may happen, if 1GB config option is used with more than
1GB physical memory, or 2GB with more than 2GB.
