yep - they are linked via sched_ops->next pointer, with NULL delimiting 
the last one.

yeah, they are not full-blown: i extended them on-demand, for the 
specific purposes of sched_fair.c and sched_rt.c. More can be done too.

yes. It's on my TODO list: i'll work more on extending the cleanups to 
those fields too.

i'm caching the leftmost leaf, which serves as an alternate, task-pick 
centric root in essence.

yeah. (Note that in CFS i'm not decreasing priorities anywhere though - 
all the priority levels in CFS stay constant, fairness is not achieved 
via rotating priorities or similar, it is achieved via the accounting 
code.)

hey, sure - but please give it a go nevertheless, i _did_ test all these 
;)

by all means feel free! ;)

by that i mean the most common-sense definition: with N tasks running 
each gets 1/N CPU time if observed for a reasonable amount of time. Now 
extend this to arbitrary scheduling patterns, the end result should 
still be completely fair, according to the fundamental 1/N(time) rule 
individually applied to all the small scheduling patterns that the 
scheduling patterns give. (this assumes that the scheduling patterns are 
reasonably independent of each other - if they are not then there's no 
reasonable definition of fairness that makes sense, and we might as well 
use the 1/N rule for those cases too.)

sure, i mainly concentrated on what we have in Linux today. The things 
you mention are add-ons that i can see handling via new scheduling 
classes: all the CKRM and containers type of CPU time management 
facilities.

that is handled by the existing smp-nice load balancer, that logic is 
preserved under CFS.

this should already work reasonably fine with CFS: try massive_intr.c on 
an SMP box.
