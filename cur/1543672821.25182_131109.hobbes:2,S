There are even some more that your grep did not catch. However, only 
few of them actually need to be changed if we add ->compat_ioctl(). 
For those subsystems that have a clearly defined set of ioctls that 
are implemented by the specific drivers, the compatibility code can
be put in a higher level ioctl handler, e.g. atm_ioctl() instead of
each of the atm drivers.
Finding out exactly which interfaces need to be extended can be done
in the process.

I had the same idea before but in addition to the problem that davem
mentioned, this would require changing every single ioctl handler
in the kernel and in third party drivers to use 'long' numbers.
Not really something we want to do during the current freeze.
The three options that currently make sense to me are:
a) keep using register_ioctl32_conversion() for everything
b) add a compat_task() function that handlers may use to decide
   if they should use the compat data structures, list those ioctls
   as COMPATIBLE_IOCTL()
c) add ->compat_ioctl() to some interfaces, with HANDLE_IOCTL() as
   fallback
