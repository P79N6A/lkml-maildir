yeah, that looks all rather messy and probably ineffective. Thomas, mind 
to take a look?
Frederic's patch solves a real timer-irq-overload extreme situation so i 
find it rather valuable. Maybe we should do Frederic's patch as-is, have 
the 'softer' min_delta behavior for the usual hrtimer codepaths - and the 
more agressive one for the timer tick only?
