Side note: one reason I'm interested in this is that my mac mini (now used 
by the kids) has had a very flaky USB mouse lately. Is it related? I have 
no idea, and probably not, but as a result I'm very interested in any USB 
regressions. There's *something* rotten with that mouse, and while it 
could be the mouse itself going bad, I think it started happening only 
after updating that machine to 2.6.23-rc1.
