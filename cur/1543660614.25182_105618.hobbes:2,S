There's also an elegant implementation that uses switch statements
or computed gotos; see 
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html
I'm using it.  It's a bit limited, but hey, it works for me.

IMHO coroutines are harder to use than either threads or nonblocking I/O.
Then again, I don't like Scheme; many things in this world are a matter of taste.
