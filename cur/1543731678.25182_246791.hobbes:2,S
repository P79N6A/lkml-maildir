  No,  not  at all. The only think the kernel would need to support is
  the actual meta files and streams - not the contents of the streams.
  That is up to the applications to know and use.
  The  idea  with  plugins  to reiser4 would allow someone to create a
  plugin that would export the thumbnails from TIFF and JPEG images as
  separate streams.

  We  do  not need to define a single format. You are locking yourself
  to  the contents of streams and meta files.
  If  someone  likes  the  idea of a plugin that would allow for icons
  then  that  may  be  it. It would be up to application developers to
  know  about  this and use it. Perhaps they could agree on a standard
  even.

  This  wouldn't  screw anything up besides allowing for extending the
  functionality.  There  is noone that forces you to enable and instll
  plugins,  use  extra attributes or meta info. All of this always was
  optional (as I see it).

  So? The same may be for your own word documents etc. It doesn't mean
  I do not find it useful now, or that anyone else might not. Shall we
  not  include  features  because "someone" on the same system may not
  use it? Seems very backward to me.
  If   I   include   a filestream, description.xml, then that wouldn't
  affect  anyone. I would know how to read the file, and that would be
  enough.

  Yes  and  no.  I  used  them  as example but there are lots of other
  programs  that  can access files. Midnight commander, cp, tar, email
  programs and lots of others.
  besides, I think it would be easier for them to 1) write plugins and
  2)  just  use normal file access method to provide the extra data to
  the users.
