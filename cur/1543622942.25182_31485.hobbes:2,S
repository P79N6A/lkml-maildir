There is a bunch of smbfs changes in 2.4.18. Some fsx fixes from december
and some cleanups from Al Viro. The latter I have not tested myself so I'm
hoping those are causing this and that I will be able to trigger it
easily.
I now have 3 reports of identical oopses in 2.4.18. All of them crashed on
a register with contents matching x0000000 and in smb_fill_cache.
Does 2.4.17 work fine for everyone?
Did any of you try something between 2.4.18-pre4 and 2.4.18-rc2?
2.4.18-pre4 has about half the smbfs changes in 2.4.18 and 2.4.18-rc3 has
the rest. A simple but helpful thing to do would be to see if 2.4.18-rc2
works.
I have planned to actually get to do some linux work this weekend, unlike
the last few weeks, so your timing is pretty good. :)
