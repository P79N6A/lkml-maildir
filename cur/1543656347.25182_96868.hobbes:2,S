Yes, I definitely think that a new AT_* value is at order and it's a
nice way to determine the address.
But it will eliminate the problem.  Remember: the x86 (unlike x86-64)
has no PC-relative data addressing mode.  I.e., in a DSO to find a
memory location with an address I need a base register which isn't
available anymore at the time the call is made.
You have to assume that all the registers, including %ebp, are used at
the time of the call.  This makes it impossible to find a memory
location in a DSO without text relocation (i.e., making parts of the
code writable, at least for a moment).  This is time consuming and not
resource friendly.
There is one way around this and maybe it is what should be done: we
have the TLS memory available.  And since this vsyscall stuff gets
introduced after the TLS is functional it is a possibility.
The address received in AT_SYSINFO is stored in a word in the TCB
(thread control block).  Then the code to call through this is a variant
of what I posted earlier
  movl $__NR_##name, %eax
  call *%gs:-__NR_##name+TCB_OFFSET(%eax)
In case the vsyscall stuff is not available we jump to something like
   int $0x80
   ret
The address of this code is the default value of the TCB word.
There is another thing we might want to consider.  The above code jump
to 0xfffff000 or whatever adddres is specified.  I.e., the
demultiplexing happens in the kernel.  Do we want to do this at
userlevel?  This would allow almost no-cost determination of those
syscalls which can be handled at userlevel (getpid, getppid, ...).
