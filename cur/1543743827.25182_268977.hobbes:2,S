Subject: [PATCH] Plugsched for 2.6.10-rc1-mm3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

While mainline seems uninterested in pluggable cpu schedulers, it seems 
the demand and response off-list has been rather large so I'll continue 
to develop it.
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/plugsched/2.6.10-rc1-mm3/
has a patch tarball and a rolled up patch for applying the current 
plugsched infrastructure.
Changes:
Rolled up the bugfixes into their respective parent patches.
Added an optional private set_task_cpu.
Privatised get_idle for kgdb.
Privatised normalise rt sysrq.
Updated staircase cpu scheduler.
Planned:
More shared code between schedulers.
Sysfs tunables.
Note that mm3 has some vm bugs leading to compile problems and 
instability that you'd need to add on if you wish to try these patches.
Cheers,
Con
