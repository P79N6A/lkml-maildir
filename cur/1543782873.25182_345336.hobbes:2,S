Thank you.
I was originally planning to submit a single patch that removes 
verify_area across the board, but I guess it might be easier if I just 
hand you the bit of the patch that handles xtensa (instead of waiting for 
those bits to hit -mm) and then submit the rest along with a note that 
similar patches for xtensa will arrive later via you.
So, here's the final bit that removes verify_area completely from xtensa :
