Thanks for you quick response.
This make sense for INET sockets, but I don't understand the security
considerations for UNIX domain sockets.  Could you please elaborate?
Moreover, /dev/fd/n, (as opposed to /proc/$$/n) is restricted to
the current process and its decendents if close-on-exec is not specified.
Again, I don't understand why this would create a security problem
either since the socket is already accesible via the original
descriptor.
Finally if this is a security problem, why is the errno is set to ENXIO 
rather than EACCESS?
