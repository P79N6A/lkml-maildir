Because perhaps it is potentially very simple - i.e.
if most of these drivers turn out to be:
if (*loc1 & mask)
{
   *loc2=value;
   flag we have an interrupt
}
then all you actually need to do is provide a way to
specify loc1, mask, loc2 and value.  You could provide
a small handful of mechanisms to suit most simple pieces of hardware
and also provide a definition for the hardware designers to say
'if you make your interrupt registers like this then the software
is dead easy'.  A bytecode interpreter seems a little overkill
unless you think that two or three levels of that type of test/mask
could cope with 90%+ of the cases.
There are probably lots of people reinventing the wheel for simple IO 
boards and the hardware guys will be making it up each time as well.
