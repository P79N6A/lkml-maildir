Ah, ok.  So there is in fact no change in setuid behavior at all then.
Do you have a little testsuite you've run which you could make available
someplace?  Or a few test programs you could toss into a tarball and
call a testsuite?  :)

Good point.

Could you cc: the lsm list (linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org)?
I'd particularly have Chris Wright give some comment as he's spent a
