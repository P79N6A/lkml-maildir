	You can pass it to userspace for further analysis.  From man
ipchains:
       -o, --output [maxsize]
Copy matching packets to the userspace device.  This is currently mainly
for developers who want to play with firewalling effects in userspace.  
The optional maxsize argument can be used to limit the maximum number of
bytes from the packet which are to be copied.  This option is only valid
if the ker<AD> nel has been compiled with CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL_NETLINK set.
	, and from a (possibly old) 2.2 kernel Configure.help:
CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL_NETLINK
  If you say Y here, you can use the ipchains tool to copy all or part
  of any packet you specify that hits your Linux firewall to optional
  user space monitoring software that can then look for attacks and
  take actions such as paging the administrator of the site.
  To use this, you need to create a character special file under /dev
  with major number 36 and minor number 3 using mknod ("man mknod"),
  and you need (to write) a program that reads from that device and
  takes appropriate action.
	The ipchains mailing list at
http://www.starshadow.com/mailman/listinfo/ipchains
 is probably a better
place is you have additional questions.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
