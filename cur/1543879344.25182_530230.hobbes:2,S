Actually, after approximately 6 minutes 30 seconds, the modprobe finishes 
with -ENODEV and the following is spitted into dmesg:
ipmi_si: There appears to be no BMC at this location
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:02:00.4 disabled
ipmi_si: Unable to find any System Interface(s)
Anyway I just checked that I get precisely the same behavior with plain 
2.6.21-rc6, so we can rule out -mm with this issue.
It's possible that this system has some broken KCS. I will try to narrow 
this down.
Anyway, the USB-related hang Helge is seeing is therefore a different 
story.
