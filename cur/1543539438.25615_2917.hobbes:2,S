<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Hi,<BR>I would like to get proper core files in my 
linux multithreaded application if I get<BR>any signals like segv, sigbus 
etc.&nbsp; Currently either manager threads becomes<BR>'defunct' or the main 
thread dumps core which is useless since we can't know the faulty location. ( I 
agree that this is according to<BR>the Linux thread documentatiion)&nbsp; But 
this makes developement very difficult<BR>since we don't know the actual reason 
for&nbsp; the application to crash.<BR><BR>I appreciate any kind of 
help<BR>thanks,<BR>-jcj<BR><BR><BR></FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
