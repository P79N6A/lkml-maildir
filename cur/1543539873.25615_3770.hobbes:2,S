	That's laughable, and somehwat concerning at the same time.
Issueing commands to the device that aren't valid shouldn't void the
warranty.  I've heard rumors this may not even be legal in .eu soon,
hopefully the US will do something similar, though I'm afraid it may
be run by the corporations a bit too much for it.

	Only if you consider 'normal circumstances' being when a malicious
abuser has root access.  I don't.

	Vendor-specific commands may be required to access normal 
operations of the device.
