Without the smp_rmb, you can potentially have a situation where one CPU is still 
reading an old value from cache while another has the new value.  It's generally 
a rather small race window on most architectures, but very bad things can happen 
if time ever goes backwards, so it's worth the overhead of maintaining coherence 
on smp.
