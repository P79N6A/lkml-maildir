The reserve is in the memory in the zone and reclaim can guarantee that 
there are a sufficient number of easily reclaimable pages in it.

The reserve always has been managed by per zone counters. Nothing new 
there.

Nope there is no need to have additional reserves. You delay the writeout 
until you are finished with reclaim. Then you do the writeout. During 
writeout reclaim may be called as needed. After the writeout is complete 
then you recheck the vm counters again to be sure that dirty ratio / 
easily reclaimable ratio and mem low / high boundaries are still okay. If not go 
back to reclaim.

Yes they are a much better fix and may allow code cleanup by getting rid 
of checks for PF_MEMALLOC. They integrate in a straightforward way 
into the existing reclaim methods.
