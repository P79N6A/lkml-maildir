I don't think this is unreasonable. The ACPI MCFG table is how we are 
supposed to learn about the area in the first place. If we can't get the 
table location via an approved mechanism, and can't validate it doesn't 
overlap with another memory reservation or something, I really don't 
think we should be using it.
I don't think it's much of an issue anyway - the chances that somebody 
will want to run without ACPI on a system with MCFG are pretty low given 
that you'll end up losing a bunch of functionality (not least of which 
is multi-cores).
