Thanks for running this. The results look interesting.

In exit_recv.c, you appear to be dumping the per-tgid data  received to 
disk too ?
If the accounting daemon isn't interested in per-tgid, shouldn't it be 
discarding the data immediately after
doing the recv() and only write to disk the data it wants ?
Perhaps I'm missing something.

Wonder if this has to do with userspace not being able to keep up with 
the data flow because
of the pathological rate at which exits happen.
Anyway, lets look at the overhead part first perhaps.
