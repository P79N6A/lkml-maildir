Why not just
	rm .config (if you have an old one at all)
	make oldconfig
That's what I always do (or you can copy the ".config" from somewhere
else, or you can edit your old ".config" in your favourite editor and
re-doing "make oldconfig").
I never _ever_ use any "real" configurator myself. The _only_ config maker
I ever use is "make oldconfig", after having possibly edited the .config
file by hand or done something else..
