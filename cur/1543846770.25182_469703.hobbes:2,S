I see the smiley, and I think you're trying to be funny and clever, but 
the thing is, I actually think that's _true_.
It's perfectly fine to break ABI's if nobody ever complains loudly enough 
that other developers notice.
So yes, we could actually even make it a real hard rule:
   "Breaking ABI's is fine. As long as you can hide the breakage so well 
    that nobody complains loudly enough that anybody ever notices".
The very fact that this turned into a discussion is a sign that the ABI 
breakage wasn't handled well enough. Usually, when we do something, nobody 
ever even notices.
(For an example of such a ABI breakage: I changed ptrace() to not allow 
ptracing another thread in the same thread group about a year ago, because 
it turned out that it was a serious local DoS problem. In the 12 months 
since, I think we had two people who ever actually noticed, and both of 
them actually caused some discussion about ways to perhaps unbreak it.)
