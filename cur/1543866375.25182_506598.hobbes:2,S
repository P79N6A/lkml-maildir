But you *cannot* care. That's the point. The warning is insane. For any 
function that takes "char *", you very fundamentally *cannot* care about 
the signedness of the argument, because doing so would be wrong. If you 
do care, you're already buggy.

That makes no sense. 
First off, "strlen()" doesn't care about the sign of the buffer, so it's a 
bad example anyway. But take something that *can* care, namely "strcmp()", 
which can return different things depending on whether "char" is signed or 
not (is 0xff larger than 0x00? Depends on whether char is signed or 
not..).
But THE CALLER CANNOT AND MUST NOT CARE! Because the sign of "char" is 
implementation-defined, so if you call "strcmp()", you are already 
basically saying: I don't care (and I _cannot_ care) what sign you are 
using.
So having the compiler warn about it is insane. It's like warnign about 
the fact that it's Thursday today. It's not something the programmer cares 
about.
