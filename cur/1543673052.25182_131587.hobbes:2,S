Hi,
  I'm not sure but this seems to be a lot worse in 2.5.x for some
reason; my logs are full of I/O errors, not ready's and other errors from
my CDROM drive that is playing audio CDs; I suspect at least some of it
is due to kscd trying to figure out if there is a CD in an empty drive.
Is there any way to selectively silence errors from one IDE device? It
would make it easier to spot real/important errors from hard drives and the
like.
Dave
