I finally removed my non removable files by running debugfs to clear 
the inodes, running fsck to verify filesystem integrity and then
doing an rm on the now non-existant inodes.  An ls -l on all the files
that were non-removable showed the following:
?---------   1 root     root            0 Dec 31  1969 if_yfgreg.h
?---------   1 root     root            0 Dec 31  1969 pre-patch-2.2.5-1
At this point I did an rm of the files and everything was back to
normal.
Thanks everyone for the suggestions.
Paolo
