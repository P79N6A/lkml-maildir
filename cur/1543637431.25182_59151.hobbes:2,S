The kernel functions are OK. The problem is that the kernel can use
PCIBIOS calls to set the registers. And certain old buggy BIOSes which
violate the PCI spec can use wrong size data transfers to set the
registers, which the CMD640 doesn't like.
IMHO the best workaround here would be either to disable PCIBIOS calls
and revert to conf1 or conf2 in the PCI code if a CMD640 is present, or
just panic() in the CMD640 code and suggest to the user to use
"pci=nobios" on the kernel command line. I'd actually prefer the later.
