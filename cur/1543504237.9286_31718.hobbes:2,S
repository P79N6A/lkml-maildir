A friend of mine had bought several of these cards at a bargain price. When
we found out there was no way to get them to run in an acceptable manner,
we sold them again and got a few 3c509's (which also turned out to be buggy,
but at least they perform well).
I can only agree with Matthew that a couple of NE2000 clones will probably
solve your problem. They're very well supported, have little problems and
the performance is ok (there are better cards, but they cost a lot more).
