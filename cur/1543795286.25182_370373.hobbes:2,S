Thanks, I reached a point when my head became muddled with bit 
manipulations, so I used arch-specific bitops but complete forgot
that they were atomic :-)

Works in little-endian too, so thank you very much. cfbimageblit may
also suffer from this same mistake (mine).  So can you test with
12x22 fonts at rotate 1 or 3 with acceleration off?
This particular line in cfbimgblit.c:slow_imageblit() is definitely
questionable.
- color = (*s & 1 << (BIT_NR(l))) ? fgcolor : bgcolor;
+ color = (*s & (1 << l)) ? fgcolor : bgcolor;
