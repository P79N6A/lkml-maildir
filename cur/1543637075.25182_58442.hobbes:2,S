I use to get SIGBUS w/Netscape 4 all over the place. The well-working 
versions are 3 Gold (almost no crashes, but ugly), 4.79 works sometimes, 
and 6 works just fine, except the usual crap since they inherited an older 
version of Mozilla...
I'm not sure if the Netscape 4 crashes are supposed to be kernel bugs...
