I'm not sure that the hang that is illustrated here is so special. It is
an example of a bog-standard ext3 write, that ends up calling the NFS
client, which is hanging. The fact that it happens to be hanging on the
nfsd process is more or less irrelevant here: the same thing could
happen to any other process in the case where we have an NFS server that
is down.

It has been quirky all through the 2.6.x series because of this issue.
