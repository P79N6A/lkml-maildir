Correct.

I'd rather drop the "select I2C_I801" if the config system can't handle
it properly. It's not strictly needed (not a build-time dependency), an
addition to the help text would work as well. Adding dependencies to
make our selections happy is a bit confusing and likely to cause
trouble in the future (as dependencies can change...)
