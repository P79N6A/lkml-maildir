And I tire of your random abuse. Just what is your problem?
If, this time, you are complaining that my post appeared twice on the lkml, 
fair enough. For whatever reason my ISP's MTA has decided to deliver the 
message twice (as you'll see if you look at the message headers). Otherwise, 
despite whatever grudge you may have against me, I am entitled as the next 
person to post to a public forum. Get a life.
Cheers,
Rich
