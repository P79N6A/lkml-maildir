I thought that in the case of modules, __init is a noop?  At least, that's what 
this page says
http://www.netfilter.org/unreliable-guides/kernel-hacking/routines-init.html
So if MODULE is defined, it doesn't matter if C is labelled as __init or not, 
and if it is not defined, it *should* be labelled as __init since it is itself 
calling __init code.
