Hi,
due to a possible incompatibility between one of the
OPN admins soliciting money on a regular basis and the
policies of the network where kernelnewbies.org is
hosted we have decided to move the #kernelnewbies IRC
channel to another network.
You will be able to find us on:
	irc.oftc.net / #kernelnewbies
Kernelnewbies is a project meant to help people learn
about operating system development by providing information
and operating a mailing list and IRC channel where current
and future developers can help each other. More information
about kernelnewbies can be found on  
http://kernelnewbies.org/
kind regards,
Rik
