We are pleased to announce the 2.6.24-rt1 tree, which can be
downloaded from the location:
  
http://rt.et.redhat.com/download/
Information on the RT patch can be found at:
  
http://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page
Changes since 2.6.24-rc8-rt1
  - ported to 2.6.24
to build a 2.6.24-rt1 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.24.tar.bz2
  
http://rt.et.redhat.com/download/patch-2.6.24-rt1.bz2
And like always, my RT version of Matt Mackall's ketchup will get this
for you nicely:

The broken out patches are also available.
*** NOTICE ***
This still has the old version of the latency tracer. I'll try to
release a -rt2 soon that has the new version. This way we can see what
kind of regressions the new version might give.
