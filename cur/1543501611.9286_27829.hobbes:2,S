Subject: ejecting a mounted CD (linux 2.2.10; vmware 1.02)

Ok, this only happens iff vmware was at least once executed. I don't
know whether this comes from a bug in the kernel or in vmware's code.
This mail goes to linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu as well as vmware if I
finally find out their bug reporting address (web site is down right
now).
[1.] One line summary of the problem:
I could eject a mounted CD.  The problem occurs iff vmware has been run
at least once.
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
After running vmware it is possible to eject a mounted cdrom even if
there's read activity from the cd. What I know, usally mounted disks are
locked if the device allows this (CDROMs, ZIP, JAZ..). After ejecting
the CD I could normally access all files from the cd that where already
cached to memory, when cat-ing other files I got an 'Input/output
error'. after unmounting the device, this entire procedure could be
reproduced a convenient number of times. { [boot; run vmware; exit
vmware;] mount /cdrom; eject cdrom; do stuff in /cdrom; umount cdrom }
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
vmware; CDROM, eject lock

PS: I know that ejecting a mounted disk is a pretty dumb idea. It was an
accident, really! ;)
