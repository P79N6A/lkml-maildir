Nope, it consumes - very fundamentally - about 64 bytes.
Even in the absense of alignment (which means that it generally takes up a 
minimum of 16 bytes of real memory), it takes up what would tend to be a 
much more critical resource: a cache line.
So an empty macro is a _lot_ more efficient than an empty function call. 
For interrupt handlers, the L1 I$ miss rate is basically 100%. Even the L2 
I$ miss rate is quite noticeable, _especially_ for things that are not 
easy to prefetch (ie stuff that is out-of-line). Which means that it also 
likely takes an inordinate amount of cycles, for doing zero work.
