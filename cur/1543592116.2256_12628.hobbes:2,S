1) I agree with it, drop-behind should make the pages we write
   very likely for eviction, but we don't want that to stop the
   eviction of other not-used pages ...
2) OTOH, if writeout of dirty pages is a problem for the system,
   I guess we will want to fix that problem somehow ;)
   (but that's another issue)
