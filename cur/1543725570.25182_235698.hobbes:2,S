BTW, I will note that I'm running 2.4; the behavior has existed on
2.4.18 through 2.4.27-rc3.
I've not tried 2.6 since 2.6.0-test0 refused to boot but I'd be happy
to try again if that furthers the debugging cause.  FWIW, I'm not
quite willing to run 2.6 on stable machines yet, for one thing I'll
lose several vendor binary drivers (Sorry, the world is a viciously
practical place :-)
