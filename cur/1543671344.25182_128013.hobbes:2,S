I've experienced this also when running "make menuconfig"
against 2.5.66 while running 2.5.66 on a redhat9 system.
I filled a bug-report on bugzilla.rehat.com and
they told me "bug is reproduced here. workaround is to
minimize the gnome-terminal while there is intense
terminal activity"... so I'm supposed to config my
kernel while it's terminal is not visible... great :)
I'd not mind trying to debug gnome-terminal if
I didn't need to install bazillons of libs
for his recompile...
