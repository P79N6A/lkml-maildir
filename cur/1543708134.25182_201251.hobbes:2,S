Sorry never posted to this list so bear with me. 
I am currently using kernel version 2.4.25 i386 with libata and iswraid. 
Note: iswraid is for 2.4.22, but it applied to 2.4.25 without issue. 
I am not sure which patch this problem is in relation to, but here is the 
information. 
I was using a php script to move a bunch of my files around the file system 
when my system locks up and I see: 
ata1: DMA timeout, stat 0x21 
ATA: abnormal status 0x59 on port 0xC407 
I try to do an emegency sync but I fails, and I am forced to reboot. 
This problem is reproducable. If any additional information is needed please 
email me as I am not a member of the mailing list. 
Thanks.
