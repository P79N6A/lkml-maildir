Yes, I think that's the case.  clear_fixmap() exists for clearing out an 
existing mapping, but its only used to clear out the WP test mapping and 
in early_iounmap (if called late).  I couldn't see any instances of 
replacing a mapping.

Yes, I was wondering about that.  If __set_fixmap is only used at boot 
time, then a global flush isn't necessary, but if its deemed a 
general-purpose API in a normal running kernel, it needs to deal with 
cross-cpu flushes.
64-bit set_fixmap is __init only, and I'd be OK with that.  The only 
non-__init use in the 32-bit kernel is the compat vdso mapping, and that 
could easily be done by other means (though it would effectively become 
an opencoded set_fixmap, so perhaps that's not a good idea...).

No, that's set_pte_at(), which is the real issue in both cases.  
__set_fixmap calls both set_pte_at and flush_tlb_one, which is why it 
gets two backtrackes.
