I've obviously overlooked something serious if you can freely doctor a
read-only file that can't be made writable without dropping the cap
flag, so perhaps you could explain what that is...

Can you suggest a better way?

Let's start by defining where were going, as you and I appear to have
different ideas of where the goalposts are. Here's my understanding of
what is required:

Please advise where I have misunderstood the situation?
Best wishes from Riley.
