This made no difference.  I suppose it's important to note that this
problem is much easier to reproduce on pages which have multiple flash
objects.  Actually, the www.disney.com home page (as pointed out by my
daughter) shows the problem better than any page I've found so far.
This page has at least two, very busy, flash objects, including menus
which popup and play sounds as you mouse around the page.  This is the
one that is using nearly 100% of the CPU.
Most other pages, even fairly busy ones, don't seem to make wine use
this much CPU, although there are other pages which show the problem,
just much less.
I'm almost positive that wine doesn't consume that much CPU under 2.4,
but I'm off to run some tests to prove or disprove that right now.
Later,
Tom
