Well, if you want to can implement only part of the "multi" standard. I guess
with little or no changes the scheduler can be put to work. When demand for
shared memory, smeaphores etc. comes up one yould cadd these as well.
(ah, realtime signals not to forget).,
This is mainly a libc issue (which has to provide the necessary
symbols). My libc (a little newer than glibc-2.1) does not define any
realtime features, although linux in fatc has them.
