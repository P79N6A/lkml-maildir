Exactly, but the actual _synchronization_ in all users of the bitops API
should (should, at least, otherwise the bugs lie in the callers) depend
upon the _bit-string_ whose address is passed to us. That could be some
flags/lock/etc in some caller, whatever, but all the synchronization in
those users would be based upon _that_ -- and we're handling it alright
with the full CPU barrier for _that_ address. Also note that in all the
atomic/unatomic variants, we always constrain the passed pointer to
memory and for the atomic/locked variants at least, I don't really see
how compiler optimizations would get us into trouble (again, for the
_passed bit-string memory address_).

... I don't want to get argumentative, but IMHO, we don't really need
to care about other (other than the passed memory address) references.
The problem with marking all of memory clobbered is that we're
disallowing legitimate optimizations for other memory references.

Of course.

Those could've been due to buggy users, not necessarily the bitops.
