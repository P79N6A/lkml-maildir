Subject: [PATCH][MMC] Bulk transfers (round 2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I didn't get any response for this one either ;)
This is only a performance boost so it is less critical. It is very nice
to have though since the performance gain is substancial (>100%).
It should not pose any problems with data loss, which was your primary
concern. It backs down to single block transfers when an error is detected.
This patch has been downloaded almost 500 times and there have been no
errors reported that were related directly to the patch. The two errors
reported from using this was in the driver and with a buggy card (the
same one that needs the power cycle patch).
Kconfig default here is 'no' but 'yes' should be considered once it has
been tested on some more controllers.
