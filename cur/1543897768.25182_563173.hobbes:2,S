I'm sure they will. Section 0 of the GPLv2 states what the license covers. 
Copying & modification are two of those things.

As has been repeatedly stated, on a TiVO or similar device they can stop you 
from running a user-built binary. They cannot, and do not, stop you from 
accessing the copy on the disc. They don't even prevent modification of it. 
What they do is stop the hardware from running the modified form.
