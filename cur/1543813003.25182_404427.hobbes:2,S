Hi
    I would like to enable Large File support on applications running on  
linux kernel 2.4.x
    (using glibc-2.2.5).
    All i did was included the flag -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64.
    I read in some documents which also specifies to include  
-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE apart
    from the above flag.
    Please clarify me whether it is necessary to include both the flags. As  
per my
    requirement i want to 64-bit usage, replacing the older ones(32-bit).

Thanks & Regards
