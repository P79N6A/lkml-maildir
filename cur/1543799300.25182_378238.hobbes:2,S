Well, I don't know what will it buy you: if ops is NULL
try_module_get(ops->owner) will OOPS just as happily as original code.
Your class_device has to hold on to all data structures that are
referenced from sysfs attributes untils its ->release() function is
called. Alternatively you could stuck a mutex and a flag somewhere in
driver data and take it when unregistering class device and also in
all attributes (and chech the flag there).
