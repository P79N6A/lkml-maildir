If that were a problem, Linux would only have one filesystem.

I dunno about that.  There's more of interest in a subsystem than just what
features it has.  Relying only on what I've seen in this thread, it would
seem natural for EVMS to depend on device-mapper - but why is it necessary
to force the issue immediately, beyond hashing out a suitable interface?
