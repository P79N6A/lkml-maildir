Hmm, sounds like what I'm experiencing. the hwclock program hangs on
read(2) from /dev/rtc according to strace. I have CONFIG_RTC enabled.
Workaround is --directisa or just removing /dev/rtc. During bootup
it is possible to type ^C (RH6.0) as hwclock doesn't seem to handle
ERESTARTSYS/EINTR. A friend of me experiences the same thing (he has an
identical mainboard: IWILL 100DBL).
