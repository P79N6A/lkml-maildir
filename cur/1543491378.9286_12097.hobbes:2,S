Yes, I like the above, I did not know you can do 
__asm__ __volatile__("": :);
to stop compiler from re-ordering things (because I never looked at wmb() 
macro). (and I like the "pseudo-smiley" at the end :).
Also, certainly bus-locked movl (or addl) is cheaper than cpuid (cpuid is
messy and trashes your registers).

Yes, I'd call the profiling results with minimum overhead (including cache
side effects) more reliable, although in the Intel's paper I mentioned
yesterday 
(URL 
http://developer.intel.com/drg/pentiumII/appnotes/RDTSCPM1.pdf
 for
those who want it) they consider the other kind as well.

The only comment is - I hope Linus (when he is back from holiday) will
consider including your get_cycles_ordered() in <asm-i386/timex.h> as it
seems worth having (and I see no problems, but I may be wrong).
I assume that if something is inline but is never referenced gcc will
simply ignore it so, whoever wants to profile something he will just put
it there manually. Almost (ignoring compile-time) zero overhead.
Regards,
Tigran.
