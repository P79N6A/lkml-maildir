Perhaps a boot time option such as:
lilo boot: newkernel debug=xxxxxxx
Where each 'x' is an option given to each driver and modules as they're
loaded, say 'v' for 'show version', 'o' for 'show options', 'd' for
'show devices managed' and so on. You could even have a 'p' for 'give
mad props' if you wanted :-).
No 'debug=' could then simply cause the kernel to kprint any info from
drivers/modules that failed to load, else keep schtum.
Just my £0.02.
Craig.
