Yea, but at that point you have to enable it in the config and then pass
a boot parameter to use it.  I dunno. If you want to go with that you
should def include a comment in the pmtmr code as well as in the config
help.

Yea, I just wish we could get away from the TSC and have a well defined
and hardware guaranteed timebase register like PPC.

Yea, no, I definitely don't like that. I know how these tricks work,
send out a worse patch to make the first look better ;) But alas, you've
worn me down! Add the comments I mentioned above and I'd go along with
it. 
Dominik: are you cool with this?
