I "reproduced" it this way on Ubuntu on i386 with fbcon (which you
are likely to be using on sparc64), when switching from a 256 to
512-glyph font. So far, only Ubuntu seems to exhibit this problem,
I am going to test Fedora for its fitness now.
# Right after boot...
	showconsolefont
# Trigger
	setfont Arabic-VGA16
	showconsolefont
# Resolve bug with 'reset'
	reset
	while $not_scrolled; do
		showconsolefont
	done;
My guess is that you see the effects of incomplete font table/position
switching, something along the lines a `cat /dev/urandom` would cause.
Using the very same kernel and boot params (vga=791 or anything to
switch it to fbcon), I cannot trigger the problem on opensuse.
