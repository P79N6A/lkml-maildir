	I have exactly the same problem with a 486 DX2/66, when I try to
reboot the computer just hangs. I have read the source to find reboot
parameters (cold, warm, bios and one more I don't remember) but it doesn't
change anything.
There's always a power-switch but it's easier to reboot with software a
computer that has no keyboard and no screen (the PC is a nfs server).
