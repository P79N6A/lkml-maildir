That's useful information.

Yeah, I know.  I'm not sure why they want this.

I'll look into it further and see what I can find out.
Assuming that I really did want to flush the whole cache, how would I go 
about doing that from userspace?  Do it like the loop in 
arch/ppc/boot/common/util.S?  How would this interact with virtual 
addresses?  Would I need to mmap an appropriately sized area of kernel 
memory to get contiguous memory?  The app is running as root, so 
permissions are not an issue.
Thanks for your help,
Chris
