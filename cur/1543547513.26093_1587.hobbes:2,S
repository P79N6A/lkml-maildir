Nice point!  Only valid for TCP & UDP though.
When people want _real_ low latency, they don't use TCP or UDP, and they
certainly don't put data checksums at the start.  They still aim for
zero copies.  That pass, even over cached data, is still significant.

Fair enough.  Please read my description of a zero-copy scheme that
doesn't require much intelligence on the card though.  I think it's a
neat kernel trick that might just pay off.  Sometimes, maybe.
