I just tracked down a hang I've been seeing in the 2.6.5-rcX-mm trees to this 
release.  The symptom is that the machine hangs sometime during init script 
startup, usually at around the time swap space is enabled (using pretty stock 
Red Hat scripts).  Before I look into it any further, are there any patches 
that I should look at dropping to see if the hang goes away?
The hang occurs all the way through 2.6.5-rc3-mm1, but Linus' 2.6.5-rc3 
release works fine.
Thanks,
Jesse
