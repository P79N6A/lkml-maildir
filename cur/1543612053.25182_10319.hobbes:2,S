I have made reference to this laptop several times previously, specifically
that it seems to misbehave a lot on battery power but work with AC power.
The maestro/2e sound chip has never worked properly under battery power.
However, upgrading to 2.4.16 (from 2.4.15pre3) made it behave differently,
if not correctly.
Now, when the maestro module is loaded (on battery), at first it works
a bit, but sound comes out at a varying rate that is slower than the
correct speed.  Also, after a few seconds it becomes apparent that the
left and right stereo channels are desynced.  (This persists until the
laptop is plugged back in, and sound is paused and restarted).
rmmoding and reinserting the module then causes this:
maestro: APU register select failed.
maestro: APU register select failed.
- lots more of these -
maestro: APU register select failed.
maestro: APU register select failed.
maestro: ac97 codec timeout reading 0x0.
maestro: ac97 codec timeout reading 0x7c.
maestro: ac97 codec timeout reading 0x7e.
maestro: ac97 codec timeout reading 0x0.
maestro: ac97 codec timeout reading 0x26.
maestro: AC97 Codec detected: v: 0x 0 0 caps: 0x0 pwr: 0x0
maestro: ac97 codec timeout reading 0xe.
maestro: 1 channels configured.
maestro: version 0.15 time 13:01:09 Dec  4 2001
This state persists until reboot.
