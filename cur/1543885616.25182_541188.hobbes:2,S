I agree your point, that's why I mention it only helped the
fragmentation issue but not the ENOSPC case.

Not totally useless I think. If only half of the space is preallocated
because run out of space, the application can decide whether it's good
enough to start to use this preallocated space or wait for the fs to
have more free space.

In fact Amit and I had raised this issue before, whether it's okay to do
allow partial preallocation. At that moment the feedback is it's no much
different than the current zero-out-preallocation behavior: people might
preallocating half-way then later deal with ENOSPC.
We could check the total number of fs free blocks account before
preallocation happens, if there isn't enough space left, there is no
need to bother preallocating.
If there is enough free space, we could make a reservation window that
have at least N free blocks and mark it not stealable by other files. So
later we will not run into the ENOSPC error.
The fs free blocks account is just a estimate though.
