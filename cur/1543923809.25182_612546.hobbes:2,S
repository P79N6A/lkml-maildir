My opinion is based on the name of max_speed_hz.
Actually, I know it is for the controller to compute the baud rate from
system bus clock or something similar.

Thanks for this clarification.
max_speed_hz acts as a default clock rate ceiling in the spi_setup(spi)
At the beginning of each real spi transfer, we should check the
spi_transfer.speed_hz like this:
---
		/* Speed setup (surely valid because already checked) */
		tmp = transfer->speed_hz;
		if (tmp == 0)
			tmp = chip->max_speed_hz;
		spi_set_baud_rate(tmp);
