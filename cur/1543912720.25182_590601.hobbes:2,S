at this point, i'm not sure either.  given the possible
interpretations of EXPERIMENTAL that i hadn't considered until now,
maybe it really *does* make sense to tag something as both
EXPERIMENTAL and, say, DEPRECATED (does it?).  that suggests you might
want to have two orthogonal attributes:
  maturity:  untagged/normal, DEPRECATED, OBSOLETE
  quality(?):  untagged/normal, EXPERIMENTAL, BROKEN
obviously, maturity would represent the position in the normal life
span of a feature as it progresses from useful to obsolete, while
quality would identify its perceived quality of code.  and those would
(clearly?) be two independent attributes you could apply to any
feature, and be able to select independently.
anyway, this is sort of covered in my earlier post from this morning.
i think.
