Indeed it does. Documentation/Changes says:
GCC

You will need at least gcc 2.7.2 to compile the kernel.  You currently
have several options for gcc-derived compilers:  gcc 2.7.2.3, various
versions of egcs, the new gcc 2.95 and upcoming gcc 3.0, and experimental
compilers like pgcc.  For absolute stability, it is still recommended
that gcc 2.7.2.3 be used to compile your kernel.  egcs 1.1.2 should also
work.  gcc 2.95 is known to have problems, and using pgcc for your kernel
is just asking for trouble.

$ kgcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-glibc21-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
Looks true to me.
