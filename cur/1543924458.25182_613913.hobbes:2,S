The simpler solutions are to
a) only pick up the values if specified on the make command line as in:
   make CFLAGS=-O3
   [CFLAGS set in the environment would be ignored]
b) do not pick up these variables at all
c) Pick up variables with a unique name
I just did c) but all three options are simple.
