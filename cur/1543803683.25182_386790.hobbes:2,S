AS was compiled, and AS is set as the default scheduler. But since
2.6.15 doesn't recognize "elevator=as" (we need to say
"elevator=anticipatory"), so in 2.6.15, elevator_setup_default() will
explicitly fall back to "noop" scheduler.
2.6.14 doesn't recognize "elevator=as" either, but it fall back to the
default scheduler instead. Which makes more sense, as Jen pointed out.
