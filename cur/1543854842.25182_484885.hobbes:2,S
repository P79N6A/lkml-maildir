If you don't want to go that far, just run a bunch of "iwlist eth1 scan"
and "iwconfig eth1" over and over and you'll effectively simulate the
behavior of NM in this situation (although doing it a lot quicker than
NM likely).
Setting up a script to just run those two in parallel continuously is
probably a good test of any WE locking in a driver :)
