Maybe:   DCACHE_NOT_KNOWN_TO_BE_CONNECTED.
Unfortunately the absence of the flags is stronger information that
it's presence and that makes it hard to name...

It is still needed.
Suppose one thread creates a disconnected dentry, and then starts building
the path from the bottom up.
When it is half way up another request comes in for the same
filehandle.  The same dentry is found.  It is now not IS_ROOT, but
still DCACHE_DISCONNECTED.  Until it is fully connected the second
request shouldn't proceed, and without the DCACHE_DISCONNECTED flag it
is expensive to test for connected-ness.  !IS_ROOT certainly isn't
enough.

Good point.  Which comment I wonder...

No.  cut-and-paste error I think.
