Hi !
In 2.6.15, platform device matching works according to this comment in
the code, or rather are supposed to:
 *	Platform device IDs are assumed to be encoded like this:
 *	"<name><instance>", where <name> is a short description of the
 *	type of device, like "pci" or "floppy", and <instance> is the
 *	enumerated instance of the device, like '0' or '42'.
However, looking a few lines below, I see the actual implemetation:
static int platform_match(struct device * dev, struct device_driver * drv)
{
	struct platform_device *pdev = container_of(dev, struct platform_device, dev);
	return (strncmp(pdev->name, drv->name, BUS_ID_SIZE) == 0);
}
As far as I know, strncmp() is _NOT_ supposed to return 0 if one string
is shorter than the other and they match until that point. Thus the
above will never match unless the <name> portion of pdev->name is
exactly of size BUS_ID_SIZE which is obviously not the case...
Did I miss something or do we expect a "special" semantic for strncmp in
the kernel ?
Ben.
