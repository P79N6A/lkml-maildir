LOCK on readl/readw/etc is meaningless (might even be an error).  The
*only* case when the lock matters is when transferring
read/modify/write transactions such as "inc", "add", "xchg" (the
latter locks automatically.)
In practice, LOCK# on the PCI bus is so poorly supported that you
can't rely on it anyway (and it causes deadlocks.)  A number of
motherboards have been known not even to wire it up.  LOCK is still
needed for SMP coherency, however.
