It's not just mtrr stuff, and it's not just arch-specific code either. In
some cases, there is a need for a function which actually does flush the
cache.
Feel free to suggest an alternative name for it, as long as it's not
'wbinvd' - I would have picked flush_cache_all(), but that is already taken
by a function which generally doesn't actually flush the cache :)
