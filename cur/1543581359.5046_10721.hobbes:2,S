The serial capture approach is tough, as it has no serial
port, only USB, etc. (Sony calls it a "legacy free" machine,
and presumes that's a good thing ;-)
The second approach sounds more feasible. Forgive the
ignorant question: how do I lookup the faulting address in the
System.map file of my kernel -- especially since it probably
is in the RAM disk used for the installation, and hence
goes bye bye when the machine goes belly up?
Thanks,
Patrick

If you compile in the serial driver and activate the serial console, you
can then grab the oops with a second computer.
Alternatively you could just lookup the faulting address in the
System.map file of your kernel.
