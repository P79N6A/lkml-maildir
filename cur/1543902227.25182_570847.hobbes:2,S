If thread A calls signalfd(), a read() from the signalfd will return 
thread A private (tgkill) signals (only when called by thread A) and 
thread A shared (kill) signals (readable from any thread).
So a call to signalfd() virtually attaches the fd to the calling thread 
signal context.
This is the reason of the "virtual connection" dropped I was talking about 
in the other email. If the signal context the fd is attached to 
(struct sighand), goes away, the fd becomes like a disconnected socket 
with no peer to read form.
