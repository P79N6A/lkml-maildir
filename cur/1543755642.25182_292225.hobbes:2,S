This is a bit off topic, but I'm interested in applications that are
more driven by time and has abstraction closer to that in a pure way.
A lot of audio kits tend to be overly about DSP and not about time.
This is difficult to explain, but what I'm referring to here is ideally
the next generation these applications and their design, not the current
lot. A lot more can be done.

Again, the notion of time based processing with broader uses and not
just DSP which what a lot of current graph driven audio frameworks
seem to still do at this time. Think gaming audio in 3d, etc...
I definitely have ideas on this subject and I'm going to hold my
current position on this matter in that we can collectively do much
better.
