OK, thanks.
Now please add the string "initcall_debug" to your kernel boot command
line.
It will cause a lot of things like
	calling initcall 0xNNNNNNNN
to be printed out.  Please take the last one which is printed out before
the crash and look it up in your System.map.
That will tell us which initcall initialisation function the kernel was
running when it crashed.
