Are you serious? Please tell me you haven't spend two weeks on the
project not realising this?
I think the problem here is that you are saying 'bio' when you really
mean something else. bio is the 2.5 io structure. What _exactly_ do you
mean with 'backporting bio'? I don't think you have the slightest idea
of the nastiness involved with doing something like that.
