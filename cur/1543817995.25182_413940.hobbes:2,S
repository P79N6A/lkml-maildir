Do you have real example of race condition?

Why? It is probably the simplest fix actually (assuming sysfs does support 
locking, I am not sure).

I never liked this automatic creation of symlinks, I believe this has to be 
done as part of device configuration (harddrake on distro you likely mean :)

Yes it is deprecated exactly for the same reason. What ensures uniqueness of 
%e?
