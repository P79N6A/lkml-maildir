Hi Alan,
The polishing is done. Versus 2.4.1 again.
Summary:
	struct task_struct{...} moved to a new file, linux/task_struct.h.
	struct sigpending{...} moved to a new file, linux/sigpending.h.
	remove line linux/capability.c:17 #include <linux/fs.h> (blessed by Andrew
Morgan)
	adjust header inclusions in CONFIG_X386_USE_3DNOW section of
asm-i386/string.h.
Changes from the first version of the patch:
	revert creation of linux/mm_struct.h (needless)
	improve comments in the new files
	remove #ifdef guards around dummy declarations (suggested by Manfred
Spraul)
	remove dead version of kernel_cap_t support (also Manfred)
	remove redundant #include's (Niels Kristian Bech Jensen)
The new task_struct.h may be useful to others. If linux/sched.h is included
just to permit dereference of some 'struct task_struct * tsk',
linux/task_struct.h is a lightweight alternative.
Thanks again to Niels Kristian Bech Jensen, Andrew Morgan, and Manfred
Spraul.
Cheers,
Tom
