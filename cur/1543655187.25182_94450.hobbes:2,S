no, the only difference ist that I don't get that message anymore, but the 
system still halts. It happens right after the controllers are detected:
ide0 at someaddress on someirq
ide1 at someaddress on someirq
ide2 at someaddress on someirq
ide3 at someaddress on someirq
and before the harddisks attached to these controllers should be detected.

gladly, but it is of course from 2.4.19, as I am unable to run 2.4.20.
it's at 
http://www.tu-bs.de/~y0013531/dmesg.txt
any other ideas?
Felix
