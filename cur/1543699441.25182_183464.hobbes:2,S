I don't see this as a problem. I'm talking about an ABI for _character_
drivers only. Everybody who needs a "loosely coupled" device driver
will probably want to implement a character driver. If you look at any
operating systems there are very few differences between the character
driver interfaces of them. There have not been any dramatic changes in
this interface since Linux 0.99.x times. Some parameters have changed but
that's almost it.
Block devices, network devices and things like that are tighter coupled
by nature. I don't eventry to claim it's going to be possible to create
an ABI for them. At least I don't see it necessary.
In a charcter driver all you need to know from the inode structure is
basicly just the device (minor) number. It's not hard to implement the
ABI layer so that the minor number can be provided regardless of the
changes made to the kernel behind it.
To the client driver the ABI "wrapper" is a black box. It can't
see what is inside the box. In particular it can't see the kernel behind
it. If something changes in the kernel some changes are needed to the
internals of the box too.
