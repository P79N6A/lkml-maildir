I had problems with resume on my IBM X41 since I got it (something
around 2.6.15) and only this patch made it work again.
Because of the SDHCI stuff I always used the latest kernel and thus I
wasn't sure if there actually was a problem or not. So I tested a plain
2.6.16 with and without this patch. The plain 2.6.16 doesn't resume on
my IBM X41 laptop. If I apply this patch, the resume works perfect.
Regards
Marcel
