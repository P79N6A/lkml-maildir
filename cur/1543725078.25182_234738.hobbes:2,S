Yeah, these numbers actually used to be a lot higher, but someone
at Intel (I forget who it was right now) found them to be too high
on even a 32 way SMT system. They could probably be raised a *little*
bit in the generic code.

The plan is to allow arch overridable SD_CPU/NODE_INIT macros for
those architectures that just look like a regular SMT+SMP+NUMA, and
have the generic code set them up.
