Susv2:
DESCRIPTION
 The sched_yield() function forces the running thread to relinquish
 the processor until it again becomes the head of its thread list. It
 takes no arguments.
Aka "I skip the rest of my turn, try the others again once", not "I'm
unimportant" nor "please rerun me immediatly".
What is it with you people wanting to make sched_yield() unusable for
anything that makes sense?
  OG.
