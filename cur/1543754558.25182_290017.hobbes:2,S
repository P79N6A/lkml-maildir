sounds really like the wrong level, any reason to not use submit_bio /
submit_bh instead? Every piece of code outside the core block layer that
I've seen that tries to do this has been wrong/broken to date.

again this very much looks like a misuse; sock_setsocketopt() gets a
*userspace* pointer as argument. Bad API to use (and if you look at
CIFS, they would also like a real nice internal api instead, but don't
use sock_setsockopt() since it's the wrong api)

those two exports are "internal" following from copying the
implementation of read_lock() into the code before compiling it (by the
preprocessor) and currently of course won't go away unless readlocks
change/go away.
Another question: is the SDD module even available for mainline kernels,
or is it only available for distribution kernels ?
