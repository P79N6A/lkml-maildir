Yup, I stand corrected.

Blah. It should be fixed, then.

Kick atomic_t-s off and use mutexes to protect simple uint or something like this.

Hmm, maybe yes. Anyway it's not so clean way to do it.
I can see, they have void *par in fb_info. I would do:
struct s3fb_info {
	int chip, rev, mclk_freq;
	int mtrr_reg;
	struct vgastate state;
	atomic_t ref_count;
	u32 pseudo_palette[16];
};
I.e. no struct fb_info inside, since you allocate the space twice by 
framebuffer_alloc() -- 2*sizeof(struct fb_info) + sizeof(struct s3fb_info) + 
padding.
Then normally
framebuffer_alloc(sizeof(struct s3fb_info), NULL);
and happily use
struct s3fb_info *s = info->par;
since par member is set directly to aligned space after fb_info when size is 
nonzero inside the framebuffer_alloc().
Is there any problem with this approach?
