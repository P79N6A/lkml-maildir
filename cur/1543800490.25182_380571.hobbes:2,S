In my original real-life test case (transcode) I found that the problem
started with the removing of "interactive_credit":

This is not actually true... in fact that change only unhidden the
problem for that particular test-case.
With my little proggy I'm now able to reproduce the problem even with
"interactive_credit" applied (for example with a 2.6.10 kernel).
Said this, and since "nicksched" doesn't have this problem at all, it
is an ingosched (and others as well) problem.
