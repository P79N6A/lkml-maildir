Devlabel 0.30.08 is now available at 
http://www.lerhaupt.com/devlabel/
It includes the --uid, --gid, --perms parameters which are usable when
adding a symlink to a disk/partition.
This ensures that the correct ownership and permissions are applied to the
underlying disk name in the event that your disk names shuffle.  So, even if
you choose not to use devlabel symlinks in /etc/fstab to ensure that you are
always mounting your right disks, you may now consider at least using
devlabel just to make sure the right permissions and ownerships are applied
to your disks in the event of a device renaming event.  Of course, if all
your partitions are just root,disk 0660 this won't make much difference.
But, if they aren't, it closes that security hole.
