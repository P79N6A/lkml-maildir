Ouch! I think you are on to something:
        for (;;) {
                struct thread_info *owner;
                old_val = atomic_cmpxchg(&lock->count, 1, 0);
                if (old_val == 1) {
                        lock_acquired(&lock->dep_map, ip);
                        mutex_set_owner(lock);
                        return 0;
                }
                if (old_val < 0 && !list_empty(&lock->wait_list))
                        break;
                /* See who owns it, and spin on him if anybody */
                owner = ACCESS_ONCE(lock->owner);
The owner was preempted before assigning lock->owner (as you stated).
                if (owner && !spin_on_owner(lock, owner))
                        break;
We just spin :-(
I think adding the:
+		if (need_resched())
+			break;
would solve the problem.
