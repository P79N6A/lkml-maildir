This fix is only needed for a subset of our em64t boxes, so it could be
just a chipset problem.  Supposedly, if I remember the conversation
correctly, when the kernel first boots it reserves about 40MB and about 20
pmds automatically.  After decompression, early_io_remap tries to setup
all the memory.  The conflict arose when early_io_remap tried to reuse one
of those pmds.  This caused the system to crash and reboot.  
I'll try to get more info Monday on the specifics.  
Cheers,
Don
