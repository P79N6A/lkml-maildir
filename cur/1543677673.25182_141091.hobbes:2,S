I was facing a simillar problem with ptrace on Alpha (ptrace on alpha 
expect the pt_regs at current + 2*PAGE_SIZE for 2.4. kernel  ) w.r.t 
www.openssi.org project. What i found was that  even after we return to 
user space subsequent syscalls are not putting pt_regs at that offset. I 
guess while entering the kernel kernel stack pointer always point to 
value stored in thread_struct.ksp ?
