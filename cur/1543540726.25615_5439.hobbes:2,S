Inspiron 5000:
 1.  For some reason APM power off is not working. It worked with 2.2.14
kernels..
 2. This is more envolved to explain. I have a dual boot system Win98 and
Linux. When Win98 boots it starts a small driver maestro.com.
   It used to be that when I reboot from Linux 2.2.14 the driver will hang
for a minite or less and then continue - apparently waiting for some
timeout to expire. There was no delay if I booted straigt into windows
after powering up. Linux had no problems.
  However in test5, the linux driver now exibits the same behaviour - 
when I try to modprobe maestro.o it hangs - and the timeout does _not_
expire. That is if I boot straight into Linux it goes fine, but if I boot
into Linux, reboot and get into Linux again there is a hang. Ctrl-Alt-Del
seems to have no effect so I guess the interrupts are disabled.
  I tried to look in maestro source code but don't seem to be able to find
a place which waits for timeout (except those i<10000 things, which seem
to be fine as they go _after_ the driver prints some message - I don't see
any). So advice wanted :))
                   thanks !!
