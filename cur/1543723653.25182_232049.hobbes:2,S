This appeared in -bk-latest in the past day or two.
BK-current on x86-64 (config/dmesg/lspci attached) will pause for 30 
wall-clock seconds immediately after being loaded by the bootloader, 
then will proceed to boot successfully and function correctly.  This is 
reproducible on every boot.
So, 30 seconds with no printk output, then boots normally.
