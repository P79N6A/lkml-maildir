FWIW, libata generally follows a "implement it, if enough people care 
about it" policy for the old HDIO_xxx ioctls.
There are plenty of HDIO_xxx ioctl should that have died back in the 
days when people using the 'hd' driver rather than the newfangled IDE 
driver.
So this change sorta filters out a lot of those older ioctls.
hddtemp is open source and reasonably well known, so I would certainly 
like to support it, if its reasonable.  For ATA disks, obtaining the 
temperature sometimes requires vendor-specific or firmware-specific 
knowledge.  hddtemp centralizes all that info in a database.
