Yes, it's a simple cutoff at the end of the timeslice. If you use up the 
timeslice allocated to you, then you have to pass a test to see if you can go 
onto the active array or get expired. Since higher static priority (lower 
nice) tasks get longer timeslices, they are less likely to expire unless they 
are purely cpu bound and never sleep.
