It seems unlikely drive manufacturers would get excited about a 
sub-optimal solution that does not even approach using the full 
potential of the product.
Plus, given the existence of an OSD-specific filesystem (exofs, at the 
very least), it seems unlikely that end users who own OSDs would choose 
the sub-optimal solution when an OSD-specific filesystem exists.

Yes, easier -- both technically and politically -- than hacking XFS or 
ext4 to support two vastly different storage APIs (linear sector or 
object-based).
It might be a tad easier to hack btrfs to do objects.

Once exofs is in upstream, installers can easily choose that when an OSD 
device is detected.

And you have a similar sales job and lag time, when hacking -- read 
destabilizing -- a filesystem to work with OSDs as well as sector-based 
devices.
