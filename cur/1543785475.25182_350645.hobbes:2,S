Subject: [PATCH 2.6.14-rc1 0/3] Add disk hotswap support to libata RESEND #3

Hello Jeff, all,
Another attempt at hotswap support to libata... this would be attempt #3.
Lots of improvements... a cleaner API, clean straightforward code
which is easy to customize (or generalize, when the desire to support
ATA hotswap comes along), and a new feature; no longer kernel panics
on any action!
Some testing on x86 UP, minimal on SMP.  Please test, send questions,
suggestions, and apply if you like it.  Patches apply cleanly to
2.6.14-rc1.  I've got some hardware so if you discover problems I can
probably reproduce them.
Enjoy,
Luke Kosewski
