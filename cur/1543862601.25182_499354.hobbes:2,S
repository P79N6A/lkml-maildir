Well. All offenders come via queue_sync_plugs(). queue_sync_plugs()
calls blk_unplug_current().
One path which triggers is blk_sync_queue(). This happens e.g. in the
cleanup of the floppy check. There are other call pathes too.
The other is raid md_super_write(). It is not plugged and calls with the
barrier bit set, which executes the unlikely path in __make_request():
        if (unlikely(bio_barrier(bio))) {
                queue_sync_plugs(q);
                spin_lock_irq(q->queue_lock);
                goto get_rq;
        }
So you either need checks all over the place to avoid calling
blk_unplug_current(), or you prevent the unplug below 0 like I did. The
BUG_ON()s I added should catch any real invalid callers. But it's up to
you.
