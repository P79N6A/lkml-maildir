Dunno if this mail and your replies will reach the list/me,
we have some DNS problems here...
I'm setting up a firewall. I want to understand precise order
in which a packet traverse a multitude of ip tables/chains
which exist in recent 2.4 (say 2.4.20). This is what I currently
placed at the top of my script:
### filter This is the default table (if no -t option is passed).  It  contains
###        the  built-in chains INPUT (for packets coming into the box itself),
###        FORWARD (for packets being routed through the box), and OUTPUT  (for
###        locally-generated packets).
###
### nat    This  table is consulted when a packet that creates a new connection
###        is encountered.  It consists of  three  built-ins:  PREROUTING  (for
###        altering  packets  as  soon  as  they come in), OUTPUT (for altering
###        locally-generated packets  before  routing),  and  POSTROUTING  (for
###        altering packets as they are about to go out).
###
### mangle This  table is used for specialized packet alteration.  Until kernel
###        2.4.17 it had two built-in chains: PREROUTING (for altering incoming
###        packets  before  routing) and OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated
###        packets before routing).  Since kernel 2.4.18, three other  built-in
###        chains  are  also  supported: INPUT (for packets coming into the box
###        itself), FORWARD (for altering  packets  being  routed  through  the
###        box),  and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are about to go
###        out).
 (above: taken directly from man iptables)
 (below: this is how I understand it. Combined from Rusty's excellent docs
  on NAT and filtering. Thanks Rusty! Anyone spot something wrong below?)

###                 v     |
###         ... Local Process...
###         ....Local Process...
 (below: basically this is what I ask)
### TODO: check order of each a,b
###       check whether is OUTPUT drawn where it should be
###       (or maybe different table's OUTPUTs must be in different places?)
