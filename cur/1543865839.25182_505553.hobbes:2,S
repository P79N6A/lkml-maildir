Subject: [patch 2/3] fs: buffer don't PageUptodate without page locked
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

__block_write_full_page is calling SetPageUptodate without the page locked.
This is unusual, but not incorrect, as PG_writeback is still set.
However with the previous patch, this is now a problem: so don't bother
setting the page uptodate in this case (it is weird that the write path
does such a thing anyway). Instead just leave it to the read side to bring
the page uptodate when it notices that all buffers are uptodate.
