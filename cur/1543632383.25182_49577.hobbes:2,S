hrm.  Actually, changing journalling mode against a file while
modifications are happening against it is almost certain to explode
if the timing is right.  ISTR that we have seen bug reports against
this on ext3-users.  This is just waaaay too hard to do.
But we can fix it by doing the opposite: create three separate
a_ops instances, one for each journalling mode.  Assign it at
new_inode/read_inode time.
This way, we don't have to do the `ext3_should_journal_data()'
tests all over the place and we just don't care if someone diddles
the journalling mode while the file is otherwise in use.
Another one for my todo list..
