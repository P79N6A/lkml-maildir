;)  I'm an ethernet direct person, i never use modems anymore, though, i'd still
like
to get all the relevent background info I could on them for future reference.
Actually, until Windows (dual boot machine at first) 'recognized' it as a
Winmodem, I
thought it was a nice, 'normal' modem.
Anyone have any ideas if a USB modem is supported yet under Linux? We have an
extra one
available currently, and I'd love to try it out... Don't want to pollute it by
starting it up
under winblows first ;)
