Just forgot to mention:
dmesg gives nothing (/var/log/messages)
the global X log aswell
and in the users .xsession-errors I have:
amarokapp: Fatal IO error: client killed
kdesktop: Fatal IO error: client killed
konqueror: Fatal IO error: client killed
The application 'xchat' lost its connection to the display :0.0;
I dont know what that means, but at least its something ;)
