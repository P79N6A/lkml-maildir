Well it doesn't make a file-system location busy! It's only files
that are open-for-write that prevent a file-system from being un-mounted!
You can properly shut down a system with the following commands from
a dumb terminal (ctrl-ALT F1,F2, etc).
kill -TERM -1	# Kill everybody but me and 'init'
sleep 1		# Wait a bit
kill -9 -1	# Really kick the hangers-on
sleep 1		# Wait again
umount -a	# Umount all file systems
After you execute `umount -a`, you can still read the file-system
because `umount` only made it R/O.
`>foo`
shows that the file-system is R/O, you can hit the reset or power
switch now.
Certain distros create a file in the top directory that is supposed
to tell startup that the system was not properly shut down, "/.autofsck",
if you deleted that before the above sequence, the machine can
be restarted with no informational error messages about the shutdown.
`cd` executes function-code 12 which makes all opens() start from the
input string "path" if it doesn't have a full path. It's just a filter.
Same for opendir() if a directory listing is to be obtained.

Could be done from user-space but opening an ordinary file
would require that the full path be obtained from somewhere
because the kernel wouldn't "know" where to create it if the
full path wasn't part of the open. `cd` is a kernel-call that
conveniently stores the part of the path-name that you don't
want to have to repeat for every open.
