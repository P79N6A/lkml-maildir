1) Does the Software RAID-5 support automatic detection
     of a drive failure? How?
2) Has Linux Software RAID-5 been used in the Enterprise environment
     to support redundancy by any real-world networking company
     or this is just a tool used by individuals to provide redundancy on
     their own PCs in the labs and at home?
Thanks a lot!
