Not at all. These were chosen because they were the default 2.4 (100) and 2.5 
(1000) frequencies. The large difference in Hz was postulated to increase the 
in-kernel overhead and the amount of time spent tearing down and building up 
the cpu cache again. 2.4 running at 1000Hz shows poor performance at high 
(>4) loads whereas 2.5 doesn't seem to do this. I originally thought it was 
cache thrashing/trashing responsible. However since 2.5 performance is almost 
comparable at 100/1000 it seems to be that the pure interrupt overhead in 2.5 
is lower?
