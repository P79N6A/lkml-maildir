Actually, ACPI_PREEMPTION_POINT() went in to 2.6.28-rc1,
it is not present in 2.6.27.stable so this patch
does not apply to 27.stable.

I don't know how you provoked this failure.
The ACPI interpreter should always be run with interrupts enabled.
If it isn't then that is a (different) bug.
There is, however, one exception, and it is during suspend/resume;
and that _is_ a legal way to provoke this bug:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12252
and thus the fix is actually correct, and I'll apply it.
