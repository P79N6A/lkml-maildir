Hi,
2.5.44uc1 doesn't seem to include the latest v850 changes I sent you (on
21 Oct, against 2.5.44uc0), though DaveM responded saying he had applied
that patch.
Did something get screwed up, or is 2.5.44uc1 just very old?
[The message-ID of the message containing that patch is
<buor8ekukw0.fsf@mcspd15.ucom.lsi.nec.co.jp>]
Thanks,
-Miles
