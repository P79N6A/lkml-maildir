Yes, we have already moved the IDE unlock code into the bootloader and 
it won't be needed in the kernel for most systems, so it won't have to 
be included into the main kernel. All other changes shouldn't be 
(politically/legally) problematic in any way.

So all all Xbox specific code would look like this:
#ifdef CONFIG_XBOX_SUPPORT
if (xbox) {
	...
}
#endif
Where would we put out Xbox detection code? If it detects the Xbox as 
described above, CONFIG_XBOX_SUPPORT will depend on CONFIG_PCI.
