Yes, the main compound stream unaware applications would see would just
be a writable view of its contents. Probably not trivial to implement
but doable.
It should be a simple format. Something simliar to tar. The worst thing
that can happen is people start writing plugins for every existing
compound format out there. It should be the other way around, agree on a
simple compound format and encourage applications to use this one if the
want to use this advantage.
