I hope I care about the final result not less than anyone else. But the
final result is not just the image size + a few CPU cycles saved when
auto-loading modules. The final result depends on the beauty of the code
much more - and, imho, my patch makes the code more beautiful - I hate
having to trace all the #ifdefs - I need a special paper for printouts 
that understands %, Ctrl-], Ctrl-t and other vi(1) keys :)
Also, the image size is greater if CONFIG_KMOD is not defined but it is
much smaller when it is defined. Remember all the snippets of code with
char name[32]; sprintf(name...) all over the place? Now they are all
compactified into one piece inside request_module().
Regards,
Tigran.
