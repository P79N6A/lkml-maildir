I was wrong, with the linux/bigmem.h trick all other arch should be just
fine ;).
I did a preliminary cleanup. mm/page_alloc.c still uses some #ifdef but
they are not trivally removable, for example:
+#ifdef CONFIG_BIGMEM
+#define BIGMEM_LISTS_OFFSET	NR_MEM_LISTS
+static struct free_area_struct free_area[NR_MEM_LISTS*2];
+#else
 static struct free_area_struct free_area[NR_MEM_LISTS];
+#endif
The cleanedup patch (bigmem-2.3.13-N) is attached.

Thanks.
