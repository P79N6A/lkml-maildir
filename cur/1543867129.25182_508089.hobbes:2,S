This paragraph seems to have a contradiction - first you say that
modules should use "planned groupings", then you complain that modules
using generic containers will find that they can't separate from other
modules "because they're part of an official API".
On the contrary - a module that's written over generic containers can
be combined with other such modules in the same groupings, or used in
different groupings, depending on what the user desires. This is
discussed in some detail in Documentation/containers.txt in patch 3 of
my patchset.
My patchset doesn't try to make all modules use the same *grouping*,
it tries to make them use the same *abstraction* (and hence share
code), but allows them to easily use different groupings just by
binding modules to different hierarchies.

No problem - that's why there are multiple hierarchies available. You
can mount the CPU accounting on one hierarchy, the virtual servers on
a different hierarchy, and they have completely independent mappings
from processes to containers - essentially parallel trees of
containers.
