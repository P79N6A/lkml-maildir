Hi.
I'm running 2.6.0-test3 and the bttv-driver doesn't work
for my Hauppauge WinTV PCI with bt878 chip.
On booting, it throws the following messages:
Aug  9 20:47:06 lfs kernel: bttv: driver version 0.9.11 loaded
Aug  9 20:47:06 lfs kernel: bttv: using 8 buffers with 2080k (520 pages) each for capture

When trying to run the tv-application "tvtime", the kernel
throws some more messages. tvtime worked fine for a few
seconds (video and audio worked), but then it froze and
was non-workable from then on.
Aug  9 20:49:08 lfs kernel: bttv0: skipped frame. no signal? high irq latency?
Aug  9 20:49:08 lfs last message repeated 20 times
Aug  9 20:49:08 lfs kernel: bttv0: IRQ lockup, cleared int mask

Aug  9 20:49:08 lfs kernel: bttv0: timeout: risc=0f7ae874, bits: VSYNC HSYNC OFLOW RISCI
Aug  9 20:49:08 lfs kernel: bttv0: reset, reinitialize
Aug  9 20:49:08 lfs kernel: bttv0: PLL: 28636363 => 35468950 .. ok
Complete syslog after booting this kernel is attached,
because it contains some more error-messages.
I bzip2'ed it because of the size.
I should additionaly say, that the driver worked for
2.6.0-test2, but threw error-messages (I posted this
to lkml before).
