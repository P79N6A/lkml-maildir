Andrew Hutton, the guy doing all the hard work organizing OLS, told me
there is an open slot because a speaker canceled.  I'm wondering if there
would be any interest in filling that slot, which is 14:45 on Wednesday.
If you are going to OLS and any of these interest you, check off the
one you want and drop me a mail.  Thanks.
[ ] Cort and I could talk about the OS clustering stuff which has been 
    discussed on the list recently.  If there are a handful of people 
    who want to talk about this, this would be my first choice.  My 
    goal is to make as many people as possible understand what it is
    that I mean, it's more subtle than it looks, Linus didn't understand
    for years that there was shared memory between the OS instances, which
    gives me a hint that maybe I've done a poor job of explaining things.
[ ] 6 months of kernel development in BitKeeper, what worked, what doesn't.
    I can do status, talk about what I know needs work, but I'm most 
    interested in hearing users complaints.  If the same things emerge
    over and over, that's a strong indication of what we need to fix.
    I'm also interested in hearing about whether bkbits.net is working
    well for you, we're thinking about adding another T1 line and I want
    to know if people want that or not.
[ ] BK tutorial.  Andrew indicated that there was a fair amount of interest
    in this.  
[ ] BitKeeper licensing, why it is the way it is.  Richard Gooch had a private
    converation with me at the end of which he said "You need to go to OLS and
    tell people what you told me, the model makes a lot more sense after 
    hearing that".  I understand that the BK licensing model is not well
    loved but it might be less hated if you understood that it is a good
    faith attempt to make things work for everyone.  I think that Richard's
    point was that that was a lot more clear after talking to me.
[ ] No talk, just free beer.  I'll buy :)
See you next week,
