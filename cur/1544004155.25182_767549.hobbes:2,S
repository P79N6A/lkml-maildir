Subject: [RFC PATCH 3/3] sched: use highest_prio.next to optimize pull operations
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/11/11/191

We currently take the rq->lock for every cpu in an overload state during
pull_rt_tasks().  However, we now have enough information via the
highest_prio.[curr|next] fields to determine if there is any tasks of
interest to warrant the overhead of the rq->lock, before we actually take
it.  So we use this information to reduce lock contention during the
pull for the case where the source-rq doesnt have tasks that preempt
the current task.
