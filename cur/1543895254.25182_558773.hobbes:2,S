How about the following "algorithm":
* Step 1: Send a patch as an RFC to the relevant lists/people and only if there
  are no negative comments within at least n days, you are allowed to proceed
  to the next step.  If anyone has reviewed/acked the patch, add their names
  and email addresses as "Reviewed-by"/"Acked-by" to the patch in the next
  step.
* Step 2: Send the patch as an RC to the relevant lists/people _and_ LKML and
  if there are no negative comments within at least n days, you can proceed to
  the next step.  If anyone has reviewed/acked the patch, add their names
  and email addresses as "Reviewed-by"/"Acked-by" to the patch in the next
  step.
* Step 3: Submit the patch for merging to the right maintainer (keeping the
  previous CC list).
where n is a number that needs to be determined (I think that n could be 3).
Well, "negative comments" should also be defined more precisely. ;-)

Still, even very experienced developers make trivial mistakes, so there should
be a way to catch such things before they hit -rc or even -mm kernels
