Please don't mind if my question is too simple for you...  :-)
I have written a special block device driver which redirects all disk I/O 
requests to remote nodes. The process which issues the I/O requests has to 
sleep in the request_fn of the device driver and wait for ANOTHER process to 
finish the network communication. After communication finished, that I/O 
process will be waken up.
However, I found that the process which is sleeping in the request_fn is often 
waken up by syslogd and klogd (even though nothing is printed in my driver). 
If I add a "goto" statement to make it sleep again, it will be waken up 
continuously, also by these two daemons. In this way, the process which 
performs the network communication will have low chance to run.
As I cannot return from the request_fn since this will cause I/O error, I 
don't know how to solve this problem, any idea?
I would be happy to provide further information if it is needed.
Thanks a lot!!
Roy Ho
