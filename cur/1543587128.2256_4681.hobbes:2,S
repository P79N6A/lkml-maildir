Hi,
I have a machine running a 2.4.2 kernel with an Adaptec SCSI
board. This worked well, but when I ran into a hang with the 2.4.2
loop device, testing a CD image, I decided to switch to 2.4.3.  But
then I get strange error messages during boot, and the machine reacts
(kind of once a day) in a very strange way, like programs failing
which never fail. Might those errors have lead to a subtile kind of
file system corruption? Inspite of the `request_module' message below,
I compiled the driver into the kernel and do not use any disk related
kernel modules. And of course, at a so early stage, the root file
system was not yet mounted.
Below are the SCSI related lines from the boot messages, first with
2.4.3, and 3 minutes later back with the previous 2.4.2
kernel. Andybody how could tell me what to do? Please CC me as I'm not
on this list. Thanks in advance.
