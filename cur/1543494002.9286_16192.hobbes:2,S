I've been having these problems as well.  They started in the 2.2.x
(and the late 2.1.1xx but I can't verify that anymore) and are much
worse in the 2.2.6 SYM driver.  I have an Asus 53c875 based card.  In
addition to the times the card doesn't want to boot with "CACHE TEST
FAILED" I have encountered several times where the SCSI bus resets
while I'm using it.  It usually goes downhill from there so I reboot
anyways.  Turning the system off for a minute or so tends to prevent
the cache test failed message from occurring.  I'm running on a Cyrix
M-II at [3x83] 250Mhz.
On my noname Alpha (with the 53c810 built in to the MB) I have not
been seeing problems.  It is running 2.2.0-pre9/final.
I am at the point where I can't go beyond kernel 2.2.5 due to
filesystem damage potential and a need for a stable system to develop
on that won't lock up hard on a whim (same story; the scsi light stays
on).
I'll be removing one or two things from my SCSI bus soon to see if
that helps, but I never had problems under 2.0.
