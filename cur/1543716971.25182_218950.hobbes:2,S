Yellow Dog Linux running on a PowerMac. While recompiling fresh copy of 
2.4.26 downloaded from kernel.org, I ran into two problems: 
1. Compiling file
linux-2.4.26/drivers/char/agp/agpgart_be.c
returned:
agpgart_be.c:96: #error "Please define flush_cache." 
I looked up code near line 96 of agpgart_be.c and compared it against the 
sources of kernel v. 2.4.19. The diference was that in 2.4.26 line 84 was 
missing "|| defined(__powerpc__)". It should read: 
#elif defined(__alpha__) || defined(__ia64__) || defined(__sparc__) || 
defined(__powerpc__) 
instead of 
#elif defined(__alpha__) || defined(__ia64__) || defined(__sparc__) 
2. Compiling file
linux-2.4.26/drivers/scsi/dpt_i2o.c
returned:
dpt_i2o.c:90: parse error before `2'
dpt_i2o.c:90: warning: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type 
Again, compared against v. 2.4.19, looks like lines starting at line 87 
should read:
#else
       (-1),(-1),
#endif 
instead of: 
#else
       (-1),(-1)
#endif 
The comma was missing.
