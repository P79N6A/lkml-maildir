Taking a quick look at the async_*.c stuff, the functions in question
basically seem to be of the form
check_if_we_can_do_it_async();
if (async_ok) {
	/* do async stuff */
	/* that's where the dma mapping creeps in */
} else {
	/* do it sync */
	/* seems fine for us */
}
So you should be able to factor out (say) async_memset_{sync,async}()
and put it into async_memset_{sync,async}.c. async_memset() would then
be
async_memset()
{
#if CONFIG_HAS_DMA
	if (check_if_we_can_do_at_async())
		async_memset_async();
#endif
	return async_memset_sync();
}
Kconfig could then do
config ASYNC_MEMSET
	default m
	tristate "async_memset support"
	select ASYNC_MEMSET_ASYNC if HAS_DMA
config ASYNC_MEMSET_ASYNC
	depends on HAS_DMA
	tristate "async_memset async via dma support"
Thoughts?
