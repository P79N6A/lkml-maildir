As far as the kernel is concerned, step b) should be a no-op.  (The kernel
might choose to split the vma, but that's not significant).

The kernel can simply register and unregister ranges for RDMA.  So
effectively a particular page is in either the registered or unregistered
state.  Kernel accounting counts the number of registered pages and
compares this with rlimits.
On top of all that, your userspace library needs to keep track of when
pages should really be registered and unregistered with the kernel.  Using
overlap logic and per-page refcounting or whatever.
No?
