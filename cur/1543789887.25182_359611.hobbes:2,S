The way you do it looks nice, but the exports aren't a big no-way.  That
stuff is far too internal to be exported.  Either we can get Andrew to
agree on moving those bits into the codepath for all filesystems or
we need to do some hackery where every functions gets renamed to __function
with an argument int cluster_aware and we have to functions inling them,
one normal and one for cluster filesystems.
