yes.  linux-next is the candidate "next" tree, and I base patches off
that, expecting that the git trees will merge first in an orderly
fashion.
Instead, there's an enormous amount of scrambling to shove things in at
the last second, thus screwing up much longer-established code.
I'm getting fairly fed up with this.

Please retest and resend lis3lv02d-merge-with-leds-hp-disk.patch.  If that's
the patch we're talking about here.
That will result in trashing the panding changes to
drivers/leds/leds-hp-disk.c in linux-next, but hey, at least I get to
poop in someone else's bed for once.
