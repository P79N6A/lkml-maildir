Hmmm... I'm not seeing this at all.
If going back to an older kernel gets rid of this problem, perhaps it
could be an IRQ routing problem or something like that. That's just a
guess, however. (If it doesn't, I would suspect hardware failure, perhaps
your motherboard; motherboard failures are the only time I've seen this
message happen with pcnet32 cards.)

I never tried that because my primary pcnet32-using machine runs
monolithic kernels...
