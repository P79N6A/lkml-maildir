There could be code using trigraphs ... and gcc has an option for that.
If this code uses signed chars, using it on unsigned-char-archs is broken
and should be warned about, but the compiler will not warn about this
because this code will not use "signed char" and therefore it's bug-to-bug
syntax compatible, waiting for a semantic breakdown.
I'll say it again: Either the code using unspecified chars is correct, or 
it isn't. If it's correct, neither using with signed nor with unsigned 
chars is a bug and you should not warn at all, and if it's not correct, 
you should always warn. Instead, gcc warns on "code compiles for $arch".

Let's asume we have this piece of buggy code. We compile it on an unsigned
char architecture. No warning. *BOOM*
Let's asume there is correct code, and we use it as designed:
Warning: Wrong arch
Warning: Wrong arch
Warning: Wrong arch
Warning: real issue 
Warning: Wrong arch
Warning: Wrong arch
Warning: Wrong arch
Warning: Wrong arch
<scroll off screen/>
Warning: Wrong arch
Warning: Wrong arch
Warning: Wrong arch
Warning: Wrong arch
Warning: Wrong arch
You don't see "real issue". *BOOM*
What can you do about this warning? Let's asume we cast everywhere:
struct foo * p;
printf(strlen(char*)p); *BOOM*
Let's asume we disable this warning:
int f(unsigned short x)
{
	if (!x)
		return 0;
	return (int) x + f(x-1);
}
f(-1); *BOOM*
Therefore unless you program for one arch with one set of compiler flags, 
this warning is useless, and I did not see much code explicitely designed 
to be non-portable.
Warning on wrong signedness is good, but if you can't enable it on 
portable code, it's useless.
