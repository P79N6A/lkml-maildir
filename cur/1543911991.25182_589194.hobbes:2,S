No need for framebuffer.  All you need is X using the X.org vesa-driver.  
Then start gears like this:
  # gears & gears & gears &
Then lay them out side by side to see the periodic stallings for ~10sec.

chew-max is great, but it's too accurate in that it exposes any scheduling 
glitches and as such hides the startup glitch within the many glitches it 
exposes.  For example, it fluctuates all over the place using this:
  # for ((i=0;i<9;i++)); do chew-max 60 > /dev/shm/chew$i.log & done
Also, chew-max locks-up when disabling __update_curr, which means that the 
workload of chew-max is different from either the ping-startup loop or the 
gears.  You really should try the gears test by any means, as the problem is 
really pronounced there.

Still no improvement.
Thanks!
