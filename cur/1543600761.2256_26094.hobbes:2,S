Well, I really wonder if buffers are the right transport medium for variable, 
large blocks, aka extents.  Personally, I think buffers will have disappeared 
or mutated unrecognizably by the time we get around to adding extents to ext2 
or its descendents.  Note that XFS already implements extents on Linux, by 
mapping them onto the pagecache I believe.

Were you thinking of one mapping for all buffers on a given partition?  If 
so, how did you plan to handle different buffer sizes?  Were you planning to 
keep the existing buffer hash chain or use the page cache hash chain, as I 
did for ext2_getblk?
