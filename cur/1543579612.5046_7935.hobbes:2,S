0x44 is the primary bus number of the host bridge, and 0x45 is the
subordinate bus number for the bridge.  Just like a PCI-PCI bridge, but
different :)  Since there are two CNB30 functions, each has unique values
for this.  The primary bus of the second bridge must be the subordinate bus
of the first bridge + 1.  PRIMARY(1) = SUBORDINATE(0) + 1;
