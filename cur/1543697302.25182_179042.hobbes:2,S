"cuts off most, if not all, avenues of support available" == any and
all problems with the things around are untraceable. We won't touch
tainted bugreports and rightly so. And nvidia isn't supporting the
whole kernel.

Yes, that's one I'm very concerned about.

They're rather sensitive to VM changes, and I've had people with
significantly less know-how than either of us come back after trying VM
patches in combination with nvidia stuff report things ranging from
oopsen, to reboots, to fs corruption. The insulation layers are only
partially effective at best. And end-users are fiddling with whiz bang
patches for their kernels and upgrading versions by means other than
distros. Heck, the distros aren't even shipping 2.6, and they're
running 2.6 plus patches.
And besides, nvidia is really just the most commonly reported issue due
to the hordes of end users, there are many other offenders on this
front (e.g. certain FC drivers, and apparently some wireless drivers).
