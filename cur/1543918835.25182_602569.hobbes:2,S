Spent whole September on LKML archive (grave) digging, actually. So,
please, get me right.
If i have finally made statement like that (rewrite with new design),
that basically means, i'll try to bring something, that probably will be
better, not emotionally (CML2 :), but technically (kbuild-2.5's 100%
slowdown of some important functionality :).

I'm not going to call (and thus targeting) that thing "kbuild-2.7" or
"kconfig-ng", "CML3000" or anything like that.
If my proposal will fit, i.e. configuring and building something
(anything) becomes more easy, more flexible, etc., then any project can
try and adopt it actually. And this will be a measure of quality.

Will see. If i will fail, who will care; i will not. Somebody spend years
of doing that, what was rejected. More than 5 years of current
kbuild/kconfig "development calmness". So...
Maintenance and acceptance of the m4/make/perl/C/ncurses community of my
mainly `TERM=linux ; sed && sh' approach is more important for me.
Thanks, Linus.
