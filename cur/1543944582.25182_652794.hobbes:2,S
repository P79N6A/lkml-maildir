Maybe it's not supposed to have this situation, but maybe you should tell this 
to the kernel itself :)
# zcat /proc/config.gz | egrep "PM|ACPI"
CONFIG_X86_64_ACPI_NUMA=y
# CONFIG_PM is not set
CONFIG_ACPI=y
# CONFIG_ACPI_PROCFS is not set
# uname -rv
2.6.23.12 #3 SMP Tue Feb 12 11:22:16 CET 2008
And you can easily get this situation from menuconfig: just fire up make 
menuconfig without any .config, go to power management options and turn 
off "Power Management support". exit and look at .config:
# CONFIG_PM is not set
CONFIG_SUSPEND_SMP_POSSIBLE=y
CONFIG_HIBERNATION_SMP_POSSIBLE=y
CONFIG_ACPI=y
Maybe if this is not supposed to be the right situation, some dependencies are 
not respected... (tested on .16)
Anyway, with .16 and CONFIG_PM set, I get this :

=========================
Anyway, it booted and so far it runs without "splice" problem, thanks.
