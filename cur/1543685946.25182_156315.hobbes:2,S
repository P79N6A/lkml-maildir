Hmmm, you may have something. I've been over this code in great depth
and I keep finding bits that didn't work quite the way I (or the
original author) thought they did.
The old version does:
 reset hash state
 for each 512 bit chunk in pool:
   hash 512 bit
   mix cumulative 160 bit result back in
 fold cumulative result
 return 80 bit result
..which is vulnerable to your (entirely theoretical) attack
The cryptoapi version I posted does:
 for each 512 bit chunk in pool:
   reset hash state
   hash 512 bits
   mix 160 bits back in
 return 160 bit result
..which is less vulnerable, but I won't say immune.
An ideal version would do:
 pick an offset into the pool
 hash somewhere in the neighborhood of 512 bits
 mix 160 bits back in
 update offset
 return 160 bit result
..which is not vulnerable and faster. I'll whip something up.
