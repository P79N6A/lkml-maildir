So, your PIX is looking at the HTTP requests, and it is validating
them. Fine. Now what is the largest HTTP request that you're going
to allow? 1k? 10k? 100k? 
The PIX is NOT filtering the size of the HTTP request. It will happily
allow a multimegabyte request to come through. Is that exploiting a bug
in your http server? You don't know. And the PIX doesn't help. 
When I encountered a PIX, multimegabyte HTTP requests were valid, and
the PIX screwed them up. A slight thinko on the side of the PIX 
programmers. 
The PIX HTTP filtering may give you some extra controls (I hear you can
do URL based filtering.... Wow!). Don't you have that control on your 
webserver?
