Ugh.  fb_console_init() can be called by
drivers/char/vt.c (one initcall) or drivers/video/fbmem.c or
drivers/video/console/fbcon.c (<-- module_init/initcall).
It definitely wants to be cleaned up, but changing initcall
order can be "fragile".  Have you tried/tested it?
Or maybe James Simmons has some updates for this.
