Subject: [PATCH 0/4] RCU: various merge candidates
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/28/175

This patchset consists of various merge candidates that would
do well to have some testing in -mm. This patchset breaks
out RCU implementation from its APIs to allow multiple
implementations, gives RCU its own softirq and finally
lines up preemptible RCU from -rt tree as a configurable
RCU implementation for mainline.
All comments and testing is welcome. RFC at the moment, but
I can later submit patches against -mm, Andrew, if you want.
They have been tested lightly using dbench, kernbench and ltp
(both CONFIG_CLASSIC_RCU=y and n) on x86 and ppc64.
Thanks
Dipankar
