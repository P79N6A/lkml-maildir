I just upgraded a server with a 2.4.22 kernel and blocksize 1K ext2
filesystems to 2.6.10-rc3. Before I rebooted, I did a
"tune2fs -j /dev/hda1" (etc) to move from ext2 to ext3 on /,
/usr, /var and /home.
When the new kernel was supposed to mount the root
filesystem, it kept on spewing the message
Blocksize 1024
__getblk_slow failed
I booted back to 2.4.22, applied the patch below, booted to
2.6.10-rc3 + patch, and now it's running just fine.
I don't see anything like the patch below in 2.6.10-rc3-bk16 yet ?
