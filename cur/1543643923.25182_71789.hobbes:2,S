I know squat about this, so am reluctant to hack code there.

See 
http://www.candelatech.com/sts2_hack.patch
 (32-bit only), it contains the missing
bits, I'm not good at generating two patch sets (ie pktgen and send-to-self)
when they touch the same file...

The #ifdefs were per request, I personally would like them not to be there
either.  As far as I can tell, the changes are backwards compatible, so there
should be no need for ifdefs.

Thanks for looking at them.  I can fix the #ifdef cruft, but adding 64bit
support or hacking ipv6 is beyond my means of testing at this point, so
I cannot make those changes.
