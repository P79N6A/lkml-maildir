This MIGHT have to do with your isdn4k-utils, and not the kernel.
ipppd adds a device-route if the version of your kernel is not 2.1.x and up.
If the kernel you are using has got an extra-version field (eg ac3),
it sets the version of the kernel to 0.0.0. The following patch to ipppd
fixes the problem. (I fell into it myself as well, even though I fixed it
once before with 2.1.132-preX)
