IIUC your machine works with a stock kernel but not
with a kernel you compile yourself.  There are many
possible causes of this.  What I would do is try to
compile a kernel identical to the stock binary kernel
that works.  Then reconfigure one thing at a time,
rebuilding and rebooting to see which change it is
that causes the hang.  That will give you a better
idea of which part of the kernel you need to look at.
Do that, and tell us what make and model of laptop
you are using.
