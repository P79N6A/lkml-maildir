To this, I would add these questions:
- do you have the source code of the DBMS? Are you sure that the 
timestamp you get corresponds to the very beginning of the wakeup time?
- if many foregroud tasks write data onto a buffer which is later read 
by the log writer, there may be locks (mutexes?) involved and the log 
writer is supposed to wait for lower prio tasks to release the lock.
