I just wrote a driver that uses these two.  Probably best if you refer to
http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads/ACPICA-ProgRef.pdf

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
