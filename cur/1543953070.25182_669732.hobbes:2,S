HI Tejun,
  setting irqpoll fixed both problems, and there are no "nasty grams" in dmesg now.   The original reason I was trying to use the hdparm -u on /dev/sda was because it was hanging for a few seconds when doing writes to the CFdisk, and in the past that was the kind of thing that hdparm -u would generally fix.   Now with the irqpoll kernel option, the /dev/sdb SATA drive was found, and I can mount it and write to it.  The CFcard /dev/sda is also responding to writes better than before.
Thanks for the suggestion to use irqpoll.    What is the problem within the driver(s) that is requiring irqpoll. ?
Best regards,
C. W. Wright
