That hasn't anything to do with "a macro is faster" at all.  It's all 
about the order used to evaluate provided arguments.  And the first one 
might be anything like a memory value, an IO operation, an expression, 
etc.  An inline function would work correctly with pointers only and 
therefore totally break apart on x86 for example.
