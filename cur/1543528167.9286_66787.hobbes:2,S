And I work in a building with probably over 1000 machines connected
to the network, most of which are windows based and have their
address assigned by DHCP, whilst some others are statically
configured.

Actually -- it does. I got two laptops the other day, both
pre-installed with Windows 2000. I turned them on, enter a few silly
questions (machine name, password, etc.), inserted the PCMCIA
network/modem card and once it had installed the driver plugged it in
to the network -- at which point it did the DHCP request and
everything pretty much worked as expected.
The only think I had to manually configure was the web-browser and
that could be automated too if someone really desired.
