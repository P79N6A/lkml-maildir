Card insert/remove events can be system wake events though.  Which
makes that restriction impractical.
I think hosts need to be able to call mmc_detect_change() as soon as
they see a stable signal.  The MMC core can hold off handling that
for a while, if it needs to wait until the code walking the device
tree gets around to resuming that host.  It's a lot more natural to
hold off such stuff one time there than in N host drivers; especially
since the MMC core already has such hold-off code.
