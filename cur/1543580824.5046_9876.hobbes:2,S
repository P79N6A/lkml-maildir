Subject: Fix for include/linux/fs.h in 2.4.0 kernels

I had some problems while compiling some applications 
with the 2.4.0 kernel.
The problem was a conflict between string.h from the libc
and the one from the kernel, which is included in fs.h
So, using <string.h> and <linux/fs.h> at the same time
brings some conflicts.
It seems to me that <linux/string.h> should not be apparent 
from user mode, so I did this patch:

Like this, the #include <linux/string.h> is "protected" 
by a #ifdef __KERNEL__, so I don't have any conflict any more.
I recompiled my kernel without any problem since I did that patch.
