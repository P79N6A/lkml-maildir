Well, the point is that pre hrtimer kernels did just sleep as long as
they internaly could. So the hrtimers / ktime_t merge changed the
userspace interface behaviour, which is breakage. We need to restore the
old behaviour and I consider it to be better than 
1. silent overflows (even if solaris does the same)
2. returning -EINVAL without giving a minimum 1 year warning/fixup time
(see the paragraph about "Usage of invalid timevals in setitimer" in
Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt)
