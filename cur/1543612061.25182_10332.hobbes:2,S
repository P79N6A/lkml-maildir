Not necessarily.  Consider a configuration where the kernel comes in over a
network, but each board contains board-specific configuration data in
flash.  Reflashing isn't likely.
And yes, people do that.  I have a day job in the single-board-computer
industry.

The speed reduction is going to be minimal.  Implement it via macros, like
it's done everywhere else.  If the endianness is one way, the macros get
optimized away.  If it's the other way, then they convert into an inlined
byte swap.
Yes, there can be a small performance hit, but it's absolutely tiny.
