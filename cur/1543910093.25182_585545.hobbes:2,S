I'm not saying that comments inside functions should be prohibited, but
comments inside functions often lead to over-commenting. There must be a
good reason for adding such a comment. See CodingStyle, chapter 8:

Also, try to avoid putting comments inside a function body.
(Before somebody starts arguing with this one sentence, please also read
the rest of the chapter; it is not long and you'll understand the
author's intention better.)
