I tried to do that a while ago, when I was trying to use it for
name_to_dev_t()ing in swsusp somewhere.
From my notes at the time:
  a) It barfs if /sys is already mounted.
  b) Fix that, mkdir and mount barf because it needs set_fs(KERNEL_DS)
  c) Fix that, it barfs because name_to_dev_t is just broken.  It is
     accessing the wrong pathnames in /sys.
I think it needs a bit of help.
