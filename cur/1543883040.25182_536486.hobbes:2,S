On a quick glance, it appears that these messages have been in the aer driver
since it was born.
Did you run with CONFIG_PCIEAER in 2.6.19 or 2.6.20 and not have them there?
I agree with Bob, as status 5 is AE_NOT_FOUND,
it appears that the driver is being overly verbose,
even though these appear to all be KERN_DEBUG messages.
