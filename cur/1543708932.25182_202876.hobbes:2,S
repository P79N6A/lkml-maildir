I have created a simple driver for the watchdog on the Rocky 3782 SBC
boards by digging through the DOS/BIOS routine and comparing that with the
IT8712F data sheet. I have it compiled on 2.4.18--25 kernels.
Anyone interested? Its not tested, because I have no idea how to test it
(I did test if it reboots after x seconds when I don't update the
/proc/watchdog file).
lg,
