In general case using any tool you will be unable to transfer the whole
path in one shot, consider low memory condition and you try to allocate
a page with high order.
So it is required to split your path into multiple blocks, I would
recommend to use messages with names between slashes, i.e.
/home/test/aaa/bbb/ccc will be sent as 5 messages with /home, test, aaa,
bbb and ccc data, this will also reduce overhead when there are several
files or directories in one parent dir. Each message should also include
some reference to which parent dir it belongs. This will also speed
things up noticebly, since you will not rescan the whole path when new
file is created, only parent dir.
I wish you success in this hacking journey.
