Hmm, I'm running the SX6000 with both, the i2o support in 2.4.18 (as a
module) and the driver offered by promise, who i informed two days ago
about a small change in their makefile to make it compile with 2.4.18
and modversions.
Just letting the card initialize by it's bios and assigning the
resources at boot time (by choosing OS Other in it's setup) and
inserting i2o_core + i2o_block makes it work fine for me.
