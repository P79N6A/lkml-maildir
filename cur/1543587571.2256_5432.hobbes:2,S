Already tried this, but it doesn't help
The actual settings (same on /dev/hdc):
bash-2.04# hdparm /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 59556/16/63, sectors = 60032448, start = 0
bash-2.04# hdparm -tT /dev/md0
/dev/md0:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.30 seconds = 98.46 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  3.14 seconds = 20.38 MB/sec
bash-2.04# hdparm -tT /dev/hda3
/dev/hda3:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.31 seconds = 97.71 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.26 seconds = 28.32 MB/sec
