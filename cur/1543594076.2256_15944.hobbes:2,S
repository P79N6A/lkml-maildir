Yes, use the size parameter. And no, ramfs has no resource limits in
the stock kernel at all. In -ac it limits to half the size of the
physical RAM unconditionally. But that's not useful for tmpfs simce
this uses swap also. So it is the admins task to add a size
parameter. I would love to add a size paramater in percent of virtual
memory but this would need some changes in the swapon/off coding.

That the kernel locks up is IMHO a mm fault. tmpfs allocates its pages
with GFP_USER and will return an error if this fails. Apparently it
never fails but locks up.
