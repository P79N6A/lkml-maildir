Since 2.6.13 or so. You need to add a line to the serial_id table in
drivers/serial/serial_cs.c, though:
	PCMCIA_DEVICE_CIS_MANF_CARD(0x0013, 0x0000, "GLOBETROTTER.cis");
and GLOBETROTTER.cis needs to be available in /lib/firmware/ . Of course the
default kernel firmware loading mechanism (either udev or hotplug) must
work, too...

Old tools will only be removed once there's no regression. Oh, and where did
you read that replacing firmware on demand wasn't possible with
pcmciautils?

Please post a lspcmcia and dmesg output to the linux-pcmcia list at
