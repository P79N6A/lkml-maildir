Good point (and partially borne out by my new numbers).

Good idea.  If I had only a disks - a slow one and a fast one,
how should they be configured?  (Or might this be another area
worthy of testing?  The tradeoffs can go both ways -- the slow
disk might seem better for the async writes, but it'll also be
worse at seeking, so perhaps might be more appropriate for the
journal disk?)
