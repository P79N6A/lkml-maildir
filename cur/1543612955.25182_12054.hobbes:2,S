I am still investigating the cause of this particular problem.  In
fact we are building up a new system today in the hope of being able
to reproduce and solve this problem.

Its an informational message, not an error.  The system is telling
you that it has dynamically determined the maximum queue depth of
the device.

This is merely saying that the controller requires that the S/G list is
allocated below 4GB in the PCI bus address space (note that on some platforms
this may not mean the same thing as allocated within the first 4GB of
physical memory).
