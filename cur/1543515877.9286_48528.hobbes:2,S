Hi!
I had a closer look at the sysctl() stuff. I was wondering how to 
check values, so I looked at the existing code...
...and realized that in many cases the values passed are not checked 
at all!  Furthermore some routines could really have a on-line 
comment.
I originally thought about writing a wrapper around the do_intverc 
stuff to check values before they are written to the kernel. That 
seemed messy.
I'd really like to see a more general framework that has the ability 
to call a function (pointer) before and after a value has been set 
(or read).
Another problem seems to be the orthogonality with the capability 
model: Only the file permissions are used.
Locking: Without proper hooks, a global kernel lock would have to be 
used (just to be safe).
I wonder whether the sysctl and do_intvercminmax could be rewritten 
to be more modular and of general use. Writing special code with 80% 
common for each variable to be set seems quite bad.
I seem unable to do that due to lack of time (in case you wanted to 
ask).
Regards,
Ulrich
