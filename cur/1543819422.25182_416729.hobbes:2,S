It's correct for deterministically and safely applying security policy 
when accessing a file.
With pathnames, there is an unbounded and unknown number of effective 
security policies on the system, as there are an unbounded and unknown 
number of ways of viewing the files via pathnames.

The point is to illustrate the basic AppArmor mechanism, using a security 
model which people already know and understand.

As Arjan already pointed out, pathname security doesn't work for:
* hardlinks
* chroot
* namespaces
* bind mounts
* unlink of open files
* fd passing over unix sockets
* relative pathnames
* multiple threads (where one can unlink+replace file while the other is
  in the validation code)
Direct object labeling is the only mechanism which allows you to perform 
reliable access control checks against those objects.

Integrity control is a fundamental aspect of SELinux, implemented via Type 
Enforcement.  Please refer to:
  W. Boebert and R. Yain. "A Practical Alternative to Hierarchical 
  Integrity Policies." In Proceedings National Computer Security 
  Conference, 1985.

My opinion is that it's fundamentally broken as the core mechanism of an 
access control mechanism, although there are places where it can make 
sense.
All I'm doing at this stage is responding to your comments on SELinux, as 
unfortunately, from prior experience, if they go unchallenged, many people 
will believe them to be correct.
