x86_64 already does some unrolling and is inaccurate as to where exactly
it happens. The only thing that is very important is that you _never_
say you copied more than you actually did.
That was the source of a data corruption bug a while ago, the code did
something like sequences: read 8 words, write 8 words. And reported the
number of bytes read, instead of bytes written, which is an
over-estimation.
