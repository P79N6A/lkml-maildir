*Please*... you're talking like 2 GB of disk space was a huge
matter... a few years ago I would agreed, but these days, I think it
is quite insignificant.  Although yes, it is redundant, I think the
uniformity of the mirror sites is more important than wasting some
disk space.
Note that the LKAMS only requires a site to carry either .gz or .bz2
files, and some people have criticized that decision, too.  It's a
tradeoff.
