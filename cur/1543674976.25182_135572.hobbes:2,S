   I have a 2.4 patch to use the acpitimer for things like this. That
   (when present) provides accurate high frequency time info.
I don't expect many problems on the 2.5.x side (which is where I plan
on doing this) since x86 appears to have a driver-like architecture
to handle the various types of timers.
