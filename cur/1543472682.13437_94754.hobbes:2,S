This evening I tried to reproduce and worked ;) and it' s also very easier
to lockup the console in 2.1.132-3 and previous:
main() { for (;;) printf("ciao\n"); }
Running this proggy and pressing a character continously will cause the
console to lockup.
I' ll explain why:
	Both the console_bh (from the keyboard irq handler to print the
	pressed char) and the process (from sys_write() to print ciao),
	was running at the same time do_con_write() and so they was
	executing at the same time disable_bh(). Since bh_mask_count was
	not accessed in atomic way it was racing and at some time the
	CONSOLE_BH was disabled all the time because bh_mask_count[] was 1
	instead of 0 while nobody was writting to the console.
	As proof of my thought I added a enable_bh() in a SYS-RQ (sysrq
	still work even if CONSOLE_BH is disabled because they are handled
	by the raw keyboard-irq while the console is handled by console_bh
	that runs after the keyboard irq has full the queue with the
	incoming char) and I was able to restore perfectly from the
	console lockup using the SYS-RQ.
	The race was really very subtle...
This my patch I developed in the last hours (ugh even if it' s very late
seems to work, strange ;)) fixes perfectly the console race here. 
Patch against 2.1.132-3.
Please try the patch and feedback ;)).
Linus I don't know a lot about Copyright and laws, and I don' t know if
it' s right to add it where I placed it and/or for the changes I done. I
added it just to be sure that if somebody will want to change Linux
licence, he will have also to ask to me so I' ll reply NO ;)
The ugly thing of the patch is that all archs will have to be updated by
DaveM and other friends...
