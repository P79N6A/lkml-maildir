Subject: [PATCH 2.6.9] fork: add a hook in do_fork()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello,
   For a module, I need to execute a function when a fork occurs. My
solution is to add a pointer to a function (called fork_hook) in the
do_fork() and if this pointer isn't NULL, I call the function. To update
the pointer to the function I export a symbol (called trace_fork) that
defines another function with two parameters (the hook and an
identifier). This function provides a simple mechanism to manage access
to the fork_hook variable.
   I don't know if this solution is good but it's easy to implement and
it just does the trick. I made some tests and it doesn't impact the
performance of the Linux kernel. 
   I'd like to have your comment about this patch. Is it useful and is
it needed by someone else than me? 
Any comments are welcome,
Guillaume
