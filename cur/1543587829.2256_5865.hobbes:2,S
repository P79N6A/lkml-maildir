Apparently the decision was made to do it this way because it simplified the
fast path of the code; but I could be wrong. I have yet to achieve Linux Guru
status, right now I'm just some guy who has hit this problem and knows the
work-arounds.

I agree. I'm not making an argument for this implementation. Well, maybe I am;
Linux is intended as a desktop operating system and in that context most people
would rather have the failsafe than the failstop. Perhaps this method is
`inelegant' but it kept up a cluster of machines we have here a lot longer than
they might otherwise have functioned (the gige Acenic driver had some problems a
while back and about half the cards silently failed-- the 'broken' arp responses
meant that we could still talk to those boxes without reconfiguring IPs).
Anyway, Here's links to a discussion that occurred this January.
If you require the 'hidden' functionality, the first message cites the following
links; the patch apparently works with 2.4.x with some tweaking.
