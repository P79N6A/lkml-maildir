Please supply a less ambiguous subject line, per 
Documentation/SubmittingPatches and 
http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html
The subject line is a kernel-wide one-line summary, copied verbatim into 
the changelog, and "set_mode, Fix the FIXME" does not tell the reader 
what portion of the kernel this change applies to.  Or much of anything, 
really.
