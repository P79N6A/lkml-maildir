The vast majority of semaphore are actually binary semaphores in the
Linux kernel .. So it's easier to mass convert semaphores to mutexes,
then address the ones that don't conform.. Usually they are converted to
the complete API in mainline..

As I say above, it's happen already.. Code is slowly getting converted
to the complete API or the code gets converted to use a binary semaphore
(or a mutex)..
