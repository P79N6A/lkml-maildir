Subject: I/O slow during disk I/O

Sometimes I/O gets really slow when trying todo 2 I/O's.
One example is that network stuff is really slow when burning a CD, it's
almost impossible to do anything then.
An other is that when a disk was turned down, and you try to access it,
when it's spinning up, all other I/O stops for a few seconds.
It's both time talking to an IDE interface that the rest slows down. Is
this normal? Can there be done something about it?
