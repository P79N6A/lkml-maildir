Yes, that's my goal in the long term, and I have a patch availble that
starts to do that:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/patches/device-class.patch
but we have a lot of work to get there.
And even then, a struct device will be separate from a char device.  For
one example, the cdev structure is used by the kernel to look up the
device properly, which has nothing to do with struct device (or struct
class_device) at all at this time.
