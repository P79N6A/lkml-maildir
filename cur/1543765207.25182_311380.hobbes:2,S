There is a great big snag in my assumptions. It's possible for a process
to hold a fusyn lock, then block on an RT lock. In that situation you
could have a high priority user space process be scheduled then block on
the same fusyn lock but the PI wouldn't be fully transitive , plus there
will be problems when the RT mutex tries to restore the priority. 
We could add simple hooks to force the RT mutex to fix up it's PI, but
it's not a long term solution.
