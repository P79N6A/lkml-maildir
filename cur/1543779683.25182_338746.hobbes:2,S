This benchmark application is designed to benchmark interactivity in Linux.
Direct download link:

Web site:

Changes since v0.24:
v0.25:
The timekeeping thread of background load no longer runs SCHED_FIFO. The 
benchmark is allowed to proceed if it does not detect swap and instead 
disables mem_load. The documentation was updated.
v0.26:
Fixed the standard deviation measurements at last (thanks Peter Williams). 
There should be no practical limit to how long you can run a benchmark for 
now.
Cheers,
Con
