Eh? L1_CACHE_BYTES is defined as (1 << L1_CACHE_SHIFT) in
include/asm-i386/cache.h, which makes for a cache line size of 64 bytes
which is right. Perhaps you were assuming the cache line size was
2 << L1_CACHE_SHIFT ?

Regardless of the above this patch can't be right: the PIII's cache line
size is 32 bytes and the P4's is 128 bytes. Interesting that it increases
performance (on at least one benchmark) though.
