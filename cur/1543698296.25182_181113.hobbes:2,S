Hi,
2.4.23 kernel shows oops when I've tried to mount hfs file system
on a CDROM in scsi CDROM drive. (Strictly speaking I'm using ide-scsi
kernel parameter.) I inspect this issue. 
This issue was reported and discussed this April:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0304.0/0365.html
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102890250915062&w=2
The symptom of oops is appeared in dmesg:
    kernel BUG at buffer.c:2518!
    ...
The line is in grow_buffers() function:
	/* Size must be multiple of hard sectorsize */
	if (size & (get_hardsect_size(dev)-1))
		BUG();
It seems that setting the block size is failed before the control reaches
this line.
With the following patch for linux-2.4.23/fs/hfs/super.c, you can avoid
the oops. The patch just checks the return value from set_blocksize.
If set_blocksize is failed, just return from the function(hfs_read_super).
