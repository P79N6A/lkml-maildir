This was on my TODO list for a while and it turns out someone already fixed the
armwaving overcommit mode for the same problem. It is easy to get into a
situation where you have no overcommit and nothing can be done because there is
no memory to clean up the stable but non-useful state of the machine.
The fix is trivial and duplicated from the armwaving overcommit code path.
The last 3% of the memory can be claimed by root processes only. It isn't a
cure but it does seem to solve the real world problems - at least providing
you have enough memory for 3% to be useful 8).
