} why isn't the fix simply:
} 
} 	memcpy(&mm->start_code, &current->mm->start_code, sizeof(struct mm_struct));
} 
} ?  looks a lot less ugly to me.
} 
That code wouldn't work since start_code isn't the first element in the
structure. It's also a bit less efficient then just copying the fields
you are interested in IMHO :).
