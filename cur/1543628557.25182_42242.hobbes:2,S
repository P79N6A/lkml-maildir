I get this same "error" with hpt370 controller (Abit KT7A-RAID),
but only if I have more than one disk attached. I recently added a
second disk to the second controller and got this since. Everything
seems to work ok so it might be only something the ide-driver
doesn't understand when one chip has two ide-busses sharing the
same interrupt. I commented the printk out from ide.c and haven't
had any problems with it.
