This is probably because the number of pdflush threads slowly grows to its
maximum.  This is bogus, and we seem to have broken it sometime in the past
few releases.  I need to find a few quality hours to get in there and fix
it, but they're rare :(
It's pretty harmless though.  The "load average" thing just means that the
extra pdflush threads are twiddling thumbs waiting on some disk I/O -
they'll later exit and clean themselves up.  They won't be consuming
significant resources.
