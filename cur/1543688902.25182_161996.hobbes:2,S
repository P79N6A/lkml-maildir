Incorrect - with a VIVT, you have alias hell.  There is no multiple
which makes it safe.

Well, I've just generated a kernel test which does more or less the
same thing (write to one mapping, write to other, read from first.)
This indicates the same result.
If you take a moment to think about what should be going on -
- first write gets translated to physical address, and the address with
  the data is placed in the write buffer.
- second write gets translated to the same physical address, and the
  address and data is placed into the write buffer such that we store
  the first write then the second write to the same physical memory.
- reading from the first mapping should return the second writes value
  no matter what.
But it doesn't in some cases.

ARM doesn't do any of those tricks.

Well, we now have a kernel test to detect the problem, which alters our
behaviour appropriately.  Thanks.
