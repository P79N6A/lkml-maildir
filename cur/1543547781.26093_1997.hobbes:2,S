Sure, you don't want to cache stuff you don't need. But the OS doesn't
know if you'll need it later or not. Hence the default should be to
preserve the caches (since random repopulation is slower).
For example, when kernel hacking, I like to keep the kernel sources in
my caches. This speeds up global searches and compiles. After a
suspend, I want to read it back from a linear section of disc rather
than seeking about like when then cache is cold.

The trick is reliably determining when there is no other disc
activity. A simple heuristic is to watch the load average, but that
falls over when you start repopulating the caches and then the user
triggers immediate I/O. So really you want prioritised I/O.
Also, you need a kernel hook to find which dev,inode,block tuples are
sitting in the caches.
