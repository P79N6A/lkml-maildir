As I added to the documentation "hot swapping should work (but is not 
recomended)."  This might make it a bit more likely to work, but still 
"not recomended."

This seems like a reasonable explination when ports float if 
unconnected.  Your patch does almost the right thing.  First 
gc_psx_command should take a data[5] argument, that was a logic error on 
my part.  Second, you compare the calculated length to PSX_LENGTH, which 
is just saying we read in bytes.  It should check <= 6, which is the 
longest string of packets possible (buttons, buttons, right, right, 
left, left, see 
<
http://www.gamesx.com/controldata/psxcont/psxcont.htm>
).  Changing to 
compare to 6 makes the patch look good to me.

Vojtech already accepted my almost-identical patch when I noticed this 
in September.  See

I'm all for both my previous patch and this one making it into 2.6.10 =)
