Hey,
Once again, thanks to people messing with the scsi layer, I'm forced to 
attempt to fix this driver, which it seems I'm the only one using :)
Like last time, I cannot confirm that this _works_ as my card is dodgy, 
but I can confirm that it compiles, and performs exactly as is did before 
the changes.
The changes seems simple enough.
thanks,
	/ Brett
