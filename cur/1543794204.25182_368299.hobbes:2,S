Subject: [PATCH 1/3] cciss: bug fix for hpacucli
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Patch 1 of 3
This patch fixes a bug that breaks hpacucli, a command line interface
for the HP Array Config Utility. Without this fix the utility will
not detect any controllers in the system. I thought I had already fixed
this, but I guess not.
Thanks to all who reported the issue. Please consider this this inclusion.
