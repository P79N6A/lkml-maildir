Can't you use the LD_PRELOAD trick to force your own custom library to
override the closed library, so that you can change the socket options
to be how you want them?
Wouldn't that be easier, and be less likely to screw up the whole
system?  
You could override the socket() call, so that you just pass through
all the parameters your library sets, and then you just put in your
own setsockopt() call on the socket, and return it as normal to the
library?  Hacky, but should do the trick if you're careful.
