So, in other words, 99.99% of users don't need to apply the patch.
They should, in order to have a better system, but 99.99% of them
won't notice the difference. That seems to be a more honest
recommendation than the "panic stations" alert that you posted.
Just because you want people to apply your patches, doesn't mean you
should resort to alarmist-sounding messages. Let's at least have truth
in advertising in one small corner of the world :-)
