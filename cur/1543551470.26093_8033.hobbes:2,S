Note that it would be nicer to _not_ do the page fault case anyway, and
just extend on the current special case of one PGD entry - just make that
one PGD entry be two, and pre-allocate the (one) PMD entry that you use
for SRM callbacks and vmalloc(), and fill it into each page directory so
that set_pgdir() is basically "pre-done" and thus nothing ever needs to be
done afterwards.
That simplifies the page fault handling.
Not that the test and conditional branch probably matters all that much,
but still.. We cannot do this on a 2-level x86 page table because we don't
want to limit the vmalloc() area to 4MB, but on a 3-level page table
(whether with PAE on x86 or on alpha), you could easily just decide to
limit the vmalloc() area to a a gigabyte or two and handle it with just
one PGD entry..
