Yes, they do.  However if you are constantly having to play with shmmni or
the others that is the problem and the array should be replaced with
a hash table or some form of radix tree, so it changes it's size to fit
the need.  Once that is done, shmmni does become a simple DOS limit.
So what I'm asking is please fix the problem at the source don't plaster over
it.

There may be some sense in this but you haven't found something that inherently
needs tuning.  You have found something that has a poor data structure,
and can more easily be fixed by simply fixing the data structure.
I'm guessing that we have a disconnect somewhere with kernel developers thinking
shm is an old legacy api and doing minimal maintenance, expecting serious users
to use tmpfs or hugetlbfs and users not used to the old stuff using the SYSV apis.
If we have serious users it makes sense to fix these things properly, in a backwards
compatible way, so existing users and applications don't need to be changed.

This just shifts the location where you have your DOS limit and could
be done transparently under the covers with shmmni being the maximum.
If we can't get users to switch to something that doesn't need tuning
that has been available for years, I doubt even more user tunables
that tune the tunables will make the situation any better.  I suspect
your changes would just confuse the landscape even more and give us
more weird legacy cases to support that we can never get rid of?
