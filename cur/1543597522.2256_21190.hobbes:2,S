How about this ( draft ) :
struct task_struct {
        ...
        struct task_struct * wlist_next;
        ...
};
static union {
        struct schedule_data {
                struct task_struct * curr;
                struct task_struct * wlist;
                cycles_t last_schedule;
        } schedule_data;
        char __pad [SMP_CACHE_BYTES];
} aligned_data [NR_CPUS] __cacheline_aligned = { {{&init_task,0}}};
static inline struct task_struct * wpick(aligned_data * ad) {
        struct task_struct * tsk = ad->wlist;
        if (tsk) {
                ad->wlist = tsk->wlist_next;
                add_to_runqueue(tsk);
        }
        return tsk;
}
static inline void wpush(aligned_data * ad, struct task_struct * tsk) {
        if (task_on_runqueue(tsk))
                list_del(&tsk->run_list);
        tsk->wlist_next = ad->wlist;
        ad->wlist = tsk;
}
asmlinkage void schedule(void)
{
        ...
        if ((next = wpick(sched_data)))
                goto ...; 
        ...
}
In reschedule_idle() when before sending the IPI we do a wpush().
We modify aligned_data->wlist and tsk->wlist_next under runqueue_lock so we
don't need another one.
A slight change is needed to reschedule_idle() to handle the new field.
Pros to this solution are 1) we are not going to give other fields a different
meaning 2) when the idle will call schedule it'll pick the task w/o rescan.
