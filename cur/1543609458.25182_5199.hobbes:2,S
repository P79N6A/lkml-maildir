If I understand correctly that it is 2.4.7 that went in, and there were 
no memory manager or vfs patches, then you are almost surely correct, 
and it probably has some relatively rare bugs fixed recently but is 
reasonably stable on the whole.  He should still upgrade to a recent 
Linus kernel though.  Yura, have you tested this kernel yet?  Do you 
recognize this bug as a fixed bug?
