Hi Paul,
My bad...
I did use the default 2... unfortunately that snippet I copied here 
was what I tried to do to rebuild kernel with out it, but make just 
adds the line back in CONFIG and asks what option I what.
So it is set to 2 as per the default.
So, corrected (and as the kernel was built):
# CONFIG_8139CP is not set
CONFIG_8139TOO=y
# CONFIG_8139TOO_PIO is not set
# CONFIG_8139TOO_TUNE_TWISTER is not set
# CONFIG_8139TOO_8129 is not set
# CONFIG_8139_OLD_RX_RESET is not set
CONFIG_8139_RXBUF_IDX=2
