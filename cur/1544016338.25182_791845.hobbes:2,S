(They became post-2.6.29 changes since I missed my chance by two days or
so.)

I vote for the cf481c20c breakage be fixed in 2.6.27.y and 2.6.28.y.
Either by your patch or by something equivalent.
*Every* call to idr_remove_all() will add unclean idr_layers to the
pool.  There may be more actual occurrences of this than what was found
so far because
  - the results may be kernel panics without traces, or with traces that
    don't point to an idr problem so clearly,
  - one or another kernel debugging build option prevents this bug from
    happening.  A kernel developer who does most of his tests with debug
    options enabled won't notice.

I wonder if it would be more robust --- or even necessary --- to instead
add proper initialization code to get_from_free_list().
As far as David and I tested the new idr using code in firewire, we
called idr_remove_all() *and* idr_destroy() before any subsequent
idr_get_new().  But in practice, idr_get_new() may of course also happen
between idr_remove_all() and idr_destroy().
And then this fix won't be sufficient, would it?
