pcibios_init (in i386/pci/common.c, which is linked in by X86_64 PCI
code) seems to do this 
if (c->x86 >= 6 && c->x86_vendor == X86_VENDOR_AMD)
                pci_cache_line_size = 64 >> 2;  /* K7 & K8 */
Is it correct to expect all AMD k7/8 machines to have 16 as cache line
size - I thought 64 was more appropriate?
On my Athlon64 laptop, all PCI devices end up having 0 latency.

I am trying to fix it up - What's the right way to override it in x86_64
code?  Just initialize it to 64 may be?
