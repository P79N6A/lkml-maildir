Unless my memory is failing me, I believe the simplest approach
is to (1) don't set CONFIG_X86_TSC, and (2) pass "notsc" as a
kernel boot parameter.
CONFIG_X86_TSC means "the machine has working TSC, period".
That's an intensional optimisation.
Without CONFIG_X86_TSC, Linux manages without TSC, but will
detect and use it if it's there.
Finally, the "notsc" kernel parameter is for obscure cases
where the TSC is present, but should not be used for whatever
reason. I guess the present issue qualifies...
