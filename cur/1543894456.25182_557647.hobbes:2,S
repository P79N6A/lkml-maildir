Sorry, I wasn't trying to "yell" - just provide a note that at that point I 
would be providing verbal stress.

All I've done is get a little annoyed that, despite evidence that it isn't 
legally wrong - at least under the laws I am most familiar with - people 
continue repeat that it is.
I can't argue that it isn't "morally" wrong. While it may not be against my 
morals, it could be against those of another person. It has never been my 
intent to try and convince people that their morals are wrong.

I agree.

I have read the GPLv2 at least three times since it was pointed out that I had 
forgotten part of it. At no point can I find a point where Tivo broke the 
GPLv2 requirement that they give the recipients of the object code the same 
rights they received when they acquired a copy of the object or source code.

In examining the GPLv2 and the situation from a strictly factual basis I can 
believe Linus' statement fully. The facts are as I stated them in a previous 
mail.
