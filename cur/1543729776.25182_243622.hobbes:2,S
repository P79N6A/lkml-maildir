Hi,
although the issue seems fixed on normal shutdown and with swsusp in
"shutdown" mode, i still get the ugly "clunk" of my emergency-parking
disk in platform mode.
The attached patch fixes this for me, although i am not sure this is the
correct way to do. Probably some device_suspend(SOMETHING) would be
better and maybe the device_power_down is no longer needed, but
something needs to be done at this point.
