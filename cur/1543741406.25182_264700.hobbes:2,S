No we are only using it as a cheap way to do microsecond level timing.
Are you saying we should just use gettimeofday() instead?
jack_get_microseconds() is called at least twice per period which can be
several thousand times per second.  Is the overhead of a system call
really low enough that this should work?  rdtsc is definitely cheap
enough.
