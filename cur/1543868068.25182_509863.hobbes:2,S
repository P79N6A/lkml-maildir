Umm, no. It's clearly the law. Again, see Lexmark v. Static Controls, among
other cases.

I don't think that's grey at all. I think it's perfectly clear that linking
cannot create a derivative work. No automated process can -- it takes
creativity to create a derivative work. (That doesn't mean that just because
you can link A to B, a cannot be a derivative work of B or vice verse, of
course. It just means that if A is not a derivative work of B, linking A to
B cannot make it so, nor can the result be a derivative work.)

That would be a tricky border case. I wouldn't presume to be able to predict
the result of an inquiry into a case like that.

That's not the issue. The fact that we can't agree on precisely where red
ends and orange begins is not a counter-argument to a claim that a
particular thing is *clearly* red.

Sure, in border cases, but not in cases where it's perfectly clear.

I agree. I am mostly talking about US law.

I cite the case only because it does a good job of explaining the principle.
Copyright cannot allow you to own every practical way of accomplishing
something. It can only allow you to own the one particular way you chose to
do something out of a universe of other possible equally good ways. Only
patent allows you to protect the "best way" or "every way" to perform a
function.
