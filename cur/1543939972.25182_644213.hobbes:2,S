Since the GPL only applies to the people to whom you distribute your
code, if you do not distribute the code, licensing it under the GPL is
100% harmless to you.
So the requirement to only load GPL'd code does not prevent people from
loading code that they do not intend to distribute.  They just have to
label it as GPL and then not distribute it.
