It does help.  The size of the locked memory is better and we
account for the used inodes and dentries.  As I recall the inode+dentry
is less than 1k.  The number of open file handle rlimit at least
lets the existing limits work.  The core improvement is not allowing
an escape from our accounting mechanism for one of our biggest data
structures.

I seen no problem for having tasks have N pid numbers.  The trick
is to create a hash table entry (struct pid) that when has a pointer
to the real struct pid. It won't be the classic pid,vpid.  All pids
will be equally real.
My intention is to give a process a pid in each namespace that it has
an ancestor in.

Thanks.
