The reported bugs are now rolled into the kgdb patch.  Also, there is a 
new README.txt.  I also included, in the kgdb patch, an updated gdb 
macro file (Documentation/i386/kgdb/gdbinit.hw) which has a per_cpu 
macro to:
	given a per_cpu structure name and the cpu number returns the
	address of that structure, properly typed.
I am also putting my current version of time_stamp_tool.  This is the 
replacement for kgdb_ts() which I have removed from the kgdb patch. 
Still a little rough but it has promise of being arch independent.
