Thanks for the reply.  But I am pretty much sure I did above correctly.
I use single-instruction infinite loop in the call path to verify
that control does reach last 'ljmp' but not the jump destination.
Below is the hack I made to machine_kexec.c file.  As you can see, I
managed to make the identical mapping between virtual and physical addresses.
Note I did not copy the code into the first 1M.  In fact the code
is located at 0xc0477000 (0x00477000 in physical).  I thought that should be
OK as I did not really go all the way back to real-address mode.
That last suspect I have now is the wrong value in CS descriptor.  Does kernel
have a suitable CS descriptor for the last ljmep to 0x10000000 in linear
addressing mode?  The CS descriptor seems to be a pretty dark magic to me ...
Cheers.
