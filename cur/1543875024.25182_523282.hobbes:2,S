I2C_HW_B_* is traditionally used for drivers built on top of the
i2c-algo-bit driver, which isn't the case of your driver, so it's a bit
confusing. Please instead use:
#define I2C_HW_BLACKFIN		0x190001
I hope we'll be able to get rid of these IDs soon, so we no longer have
to care about this mess.
Other than that I'm OK with the patch this time, I'll push it on my
stack. I'll fix the ID issue myself, no need to resend. This also means
that, from now on, any change to this driver should be provided as an
incremental patch on top of this version.
Thanks,
