Hi,
Sorry about the newbie question but I haven't managed
to get answer elsewhere :-)
I have a laptop (Fujitsu Lifebook C1020) Debian system
with linux-2.6.1 vanilla.
An I have wondered how I should but it in sleep?
# echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep 
writes the ram in the swap:
Stopping tasks: ===================================================|
Freeing memory: ........................|

hda: completing PM request, resume
hdc: Wakeup request inited, waiting for !BSY...
hdc: start_power_step(step: 1000)
hdc: completing PM request, resume
Fixing swap signatures... ok
Restarting tasks... done
And after reboot comes back to same than it was before
This behaviour is kind of "big sleep" and have to boot from grub.
When I do
# echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep
it beebs from bios and do:
PM: Preparing system for suspend
Stopping tasks: ===================================================|
hdc: start_power_step(step: 0)
hdc: completing PM request, suspend
hda: start_power_step(step: 0)
hda: start_power_step(step: 1)
hda: complete_power_step(step: 1, stat: 50, err: 0)
hda: completing PM request, suspend
PM: Entering state.
Back to C!
PM: Finishing up.

hdc: completing PM request, resume
Restarting tasks...<6>usb 1-1: USB disconnect, address 2

psmouse: reconnect request, but serio is disconnected, ignoring...
 done
hub 1-0:1.0: new USB device on port 1, assigned address 3
usb 1-1: control timeout on ep0out
And with pressing power button everything else comes back exept
usb.
This behaviour is kind of "little light nap" and system comes back fast.
And I have also noticed that I cannot use bios passwd with
# echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep   cause even it doesn't reboot it goes
somehow to bios and bios passwd prompted but it doesn't accept it?
But after disabled bios passwd it works exept usb.
Can somebody give me any wise what I'm doing wrong or point
me to some documentation about this matter?
Thank you for your patience and possible answers advance :-)
