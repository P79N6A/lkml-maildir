My hardware is PowerPC architecture. Does it have any thing to do with
the kernel locking? Also, I saw CONFIG_LOCK_KERNEL,
CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL ans CONFIG_SMP in the file
include/linux/smp_lock.h, or CONFIG_PREEMPT  in lib/kernel_lock.c and
I don't have any of these macro defined, would that be the reason. I
could not find where these option when running make menuconfig either.
Thanks,
