Well, it makes sense to me that the resource would be a child of the
reserved area, because the reserved area covers the APICs and this
rather annoying PCI device has one of the IO APICs tied to BAR0.
In this case, we have a PCI device claiming something we already
discovered and made use of long ago in bootup.

The pragmatist in me says we can handle them all as a single case. 
Simply put, it means insert_resource() says "I know this belongs in the
resource tree, just put it in where it should go, please".  As long as
we make sure we only use it for the exception cases, it should all work
fine.
All I really want is to get the alter 4 and 8 way boxes working again,
I'm happy to go with whatever people decide about resources.  What other
uses are there for the TENTATIVE regions?
