That's actually a gas bug, introduced when the gas people tightened up
their requirements, and they seem to have tightened them a bit too much.
The 16-bit register is actually the correct one in 16-bit mode, and a
32-bit register is very much not correct.
Who maintains gas these days? We'll make the kernel use the 32-bit
register to work around the gas bug for now, but it definitely IS a gas
bug, and it would be good to get it fixed.
