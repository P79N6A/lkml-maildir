I think it will work ok for 2.6.22 but I don't think this is a final
solution: input_unregister_device might not free the device right away.
If there is a process that hangs on to one of the input interfaces
(evdev or mousedev) then freeing of the device structure may be delayed
and we may still run into the case when session is wiped out before
device is freed.
