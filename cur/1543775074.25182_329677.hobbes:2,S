If we have versions A through A+N, Mercurial will create a new revlog  
file and
store a new full version when the total size of the changes between A  
and A+N
is greater than a certain amount, effectively ensuring that  
retrieving the
latest version of a file is O(size-of-file) instead of O(size-of- 
file*revisions).
This is the same speed as RCS for the tip, and significantly faster  
than RCS
for non-tip, which is crucial for merges.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the  
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious  
deficiencies.
