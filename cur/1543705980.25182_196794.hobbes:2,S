  Ok, but the fact is I didn't have those problems with the other kernel, they 
started right after I booted with 2.6.2. So the problem _must_ be related to 
2.6.2 which was the only thing that changed on this system.
  Anyway other people are reporting this with different window managers and 
even with raw X so I believe that supports the case that this is 2.6.2 
related...
