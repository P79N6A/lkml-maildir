Dear All,
       I am new to this group. I was asked to write a device driver for a 
new pci card. My doubt is, Kernel will detect a new pci card which is 
attached to the system? Or how we can make the kernel to detect the new 
card which is newly attached? I am using kernel 2.6.11.12. Please suggest 
me regarding this.
Regards,
vpriya.
