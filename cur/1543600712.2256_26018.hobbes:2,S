Okay, I've now changed the IDE cable attached to my hard drives twice, and I'm
still getting IDE DMA problems - has anyone else with a SIS 735 based
motherboard been having any problems, because I'm running short of ideas?
Also - what are the chances of data corruption from these errors?
Thanks,
Adrian.
