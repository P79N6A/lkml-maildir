You really need it down to the Hz?

Not needed. fb_pan_display in fbmem.c does this check for you :-)

Many cards require a fb_sync function after/before they do a drawing 
operation. I notice you don't have one. Is sm501fb_sync_regs equivalent to 
that?
Other than that the driver looks great. Thank you.
