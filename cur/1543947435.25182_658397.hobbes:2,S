2.6.24-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us
know.
------------------
 
 From: David Chinner <dgc@sgi.com>
patch 450790a2c51e6d9d47ed30dbdcf486656b8e186f in mainline.
Several occurrences of oops in xfs_file_readdir() on ia32 have been
reported since 2.6.24 was released. This is a regression introduced
in 2.6.24 and is relatively easy to hit. The patch below fixes the
problem.
