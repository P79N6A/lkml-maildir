when I use "insmod -f hello.o" in my Embeded linux,the warning appears:
Warning: Kernel-module version mismatch
         hello.o was compiled for kernel version 2.4.24-per2
         while this kernel is version 2.4.25
Warning: loading hello.o will taint the kernel: forced load
   see

 for information about tainted modules
Is there any problem on my using my module function with this warning?
