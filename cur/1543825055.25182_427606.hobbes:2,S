Subject: PROBLEM: udev "unable to handle kernel paging request" FC5 2.6.16-1.2122

Over the past several kernel upgrades, I've begun to have problems getting
past the udev section of FC5.  Sometimes I get the "unable to handle kernel
paging request" message at the udev, other times it just sits until I turn 
the machine off, sometimes it seems to generate an oops, and dumps until
I turn the machine off.  Some of the dump messages have the following:
do_page_fault + 0x0/0x51d or do_page_fault + 0x8a/0x51d repeated over and over.
Machine is a Dell 4550, with the following info:
Linux version 2.6.16-1.2122_FC5
Cpuinfo: Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.53GHz
Firewire: FireWire (IEEE 1394): Texas Instruments TSB12LV26 IEEE-1394 Controller
Video:  ATI Technologies Inc Radeon RV250 [Radeon 9000]
PCI Bridge: Intel Corporation 82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE/PE Host-to-AGP
Sound card: Creative Labs [SB Live! Value] EMU10k1X
Ethernet: Intel Corporation 82801DB PRO/100 VE (LOM)
Modem:  Conexant Unknown device 2702 (rev 01)
Mouse:  Logitech USB Optical Mouse
Memory:  1035444 kB
I haven't been able to get a complete copy of the dump when it happens, but
was able to copy the do_page_faults by hand this last fault.
Any insights would be appreciated.
