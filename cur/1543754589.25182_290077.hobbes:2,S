????? Let's count again, shall we? Suppose we have:
> superio1 - voltage, temp, gpio, rtc, wdt, acb

superio1 is driven by scx200 hardware, superio2 is driven by pc8736x
or whatever. So here, you have 2 drivers to manage chips. Plus you
have 6 superio interface drivers - gpio, acb, etc...
It is exactly the same as your cheme size-wise.
There is no need to many-to-many relationship. Each chip is bound to
only one chip driver which registers several interfaces. Each
interface is bound to only one interface driver. Interface driver is
not chip specific, it knows how to run a specific interface (gpio,
temp) and relies on chip driver to properly manage access to the
hardware. Each combination of inetrface + interface driver produce one
class_device (call it sio, serio, whatever). Class device provides
unified view of the interface to the userspace.
What am I missing?
