This doesn't have quite as much to do with -mm as it probably should,
but this high pitched noise + random static on ALSA playback happens
on all of my machines that use intel8x0 PAST 2.6.1-rc1-mm2. (That is,
2.6.1-rc2 stock has the bug, onwards until this release 2.6.2-rc2-mm1.)
As I've repeated a few times on a few threads on LKML, this involves:
1) a high pitched whining type noise when the system is *NOT* under load
   which goes away if the CPU usage is at ~100%.
2) lots of annoying pops of static during wave playback (hurts my ears.)
I'm not so bold as to try to figure what changed between 2.6.1-rc1-mm2
and 2.6.1-rc2 stock that could have caused this. Can anyone offer
pointers on how to tackle this bug? I don't wish to be stuck with such
an old kernel in the heat of 2.6 stable release development :)
Hoping for a quick resolution for this bug. Other people have noticed it
as well...
