We're working on the docs for the 2.0 release.  You can get the old
release at the same port number as the web server (the BK server serves
up HTTP and the BK protocol).  We put each release on that port as we
release it.  If you need more current access, you need to talk to us,
we'll give you an ssh account if it is the right thing to do.
