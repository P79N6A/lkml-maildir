You're right - I was just thinking the same thing.  There is also
another side effect, which is ironic in the context of recent discussion:
     3) Because mnt_namespace may refer to freed memory, it may refer
        to memory that's then allocated for _another_ namespace.  So the
        check for mounting in the correct namespace which prevents
	recursive bind mounts could erronously _allow_ the recursive
	bind to succeed (though without taking the correct lock).
