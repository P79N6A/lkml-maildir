I have once ported Basilisk to work native on linux-m68k. It works
*slow* so I looked what the problem is - the signal delivery in
Linux is exorbitantly slow. Eg an SIGILL delivery costs ~ 1650 cycles 
on a 68060, compared to that sigreturn and getpid are 200-250 and 
sched_yield with context switch around 400.
So sigreturn is not the place I would be looking for the biggest
speedups.
