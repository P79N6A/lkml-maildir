Dear All,
This question has been submited to the "scsi" list, if there's any... By 
Herve Morillon and/or Mark Salyzyn... Well, I took a look in the 2.4.28 
sources, and saw the the aacraid version seems to be the 1.1.3 - The 
1.1.5-2326 is now available and seems to be more stable than these older 
versions. Why don't you include it in the next 2.4 release ?... I've tested 
it for a few weeks and saw a performance improvement and... No more RAID 
Array config losts !
Kind Regards and thanks for all your job guys!
