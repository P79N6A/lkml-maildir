Yes, ftrace function tracing requires -pg which requires FRAME_POINTER

Perhaps we should add a HAVE_NORMAL_FRAME_POINTERS in 
arch/powerpc/Kconfig under PPC and then we can change the above line to:
#if defined(CONFIG_FRAME_POINTERS) || \
		defined(CONFIG_HAVE_NORMAL_FRAME_POINTERS)
This way when another arch wants to belong to this, we do not need to
have a list of archs here.
