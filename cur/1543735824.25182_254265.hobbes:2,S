Oops..
I'll fix these.

I'll fix this, thanks.

I had been considering what the "undefined dev->irq" was.
In fact, I had other ideas that was clearing it by zero or
-1 (0xffffffff). But I didn't know if we can use these values
as a undefined IRQ number. So I'm clearing it by the value
which was assigned by PCI core code (pci_read_irq()) before
acpi_pci_irq_enable() was called. 
How do you think?
Thanks,
Kenji Kaneshige
