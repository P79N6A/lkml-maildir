Enable displaying of connection watchdog logouts on the server.  Do not
use 'intr' mount option.  Do not send KILL signal to the connection
which is waiting for reply from server.  If you are not sure that your
network infrastructure is fine, use 'hard' mount option to disable
timeouts altogether.

Into 'ncp_invalidate_conn()', or better, into its callers.  One is in
__abort_ncp_connection (invoked for IPX connections when
__ncpdgram_timeout_proc fires), second is in ncp_do_request (if server
reports some problem, or if KILL signal is sent to the process).
