 Agreed, loss of sync is not an unuaual event in itself, but under
kernels < 2.2.13 I remember this happening much less often.  The two
above are about 15 minutes apart on a lightly loaded machine, which
leaves me somewhat suspicious.  Under 2.2.14-pre17/18 they were rare-
now they are back.

 I'm really not too worried about this, 'just thought somebody might
want to know about a possible change in behavior that "may" be kernel
related-
