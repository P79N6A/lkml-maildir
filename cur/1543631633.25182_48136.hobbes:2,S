I know, I have seen this before in the list.

I did quite a lot of reboots. I could reproduce it in the pre4 kernel.
My last try at the kernels. When I coppied the pre8 .config in the pre4
tree, and remade the kernel I got the same problem.
So after quite a bit of fiddeling I blame it on a non fully functional
ACPI so I switched back to the APM and the shutdown -h is functioning as
it should.
Attached are the configuration files of the 2.4.18-pr4 kernel with a
working and with a diff to the not working kernel (working meaning yes
or no powerdown).
I can not find anything that indicates a possibility.
I switched back to APM and it is working. with nvidia drivers and 4front
drivers.
Reason for switching to 2.4.19-pre8 is stability, I had random freezes.
I did not have them again in this series.
