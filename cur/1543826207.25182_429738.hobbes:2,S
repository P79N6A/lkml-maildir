| Nice first cut at this.  But please try to also convert 2 other drivers
| at the same time to make sure that the model is right.  I'd suggest the
| io_edgeport and the funsoft drivers.  io_edgeport because it is very
| complex in that it doesn't share a single bulk in/out pair for every
| port, but multiplexes them all through one pipe.  And funsoft because we
| want to still be able to write usb-serial drivers that are this simple.
 I'd love to do that but, unfortunatally, USB-Serial cables are too
expensive in Brazil (and I have no sure if I can find these ones in
Curitiba).
 The Prolific 2303 cables I have were lent by Mandriva.
 Couldn't someone send these cables for me in Brazil? I can send they
back when the port is finished.
| I agree with most of Pete's comments and like the general idea of moving
| the usb-serial core to be more like libata (provider of helper
| functions, not getting in the middle of everything).  I'll wait for your
| next cut to provide specific code comments.
 Hope to have something to show in the next days.
