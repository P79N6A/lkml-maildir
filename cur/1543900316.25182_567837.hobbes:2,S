Well, it was a test setup with UML and busybox and didn't have all the 
SLOB optimizations Nick mentioned, so we shouldn't draw any definite 
conclusions from it. I couldn't get 2.6.22-rc6-mm1 to compile so I'll try 
again after Andrew pushes a new release out.
Furthermore, as much as I would like to see SLOB nuked too, we can't do 
that until Matt and Nick are satisfied with SLUB for small devices and 
what I can gather, they aren't.
