Subject: ext3 fs problem in 2.4.18-rc1?

I'm using 2.4.18-rc1 with the preempt patch and whenever I run fsck, it
keeps finding more and more errors.  Specifically those related to
corrupted orphan linked lists. I dont know what is going on but I know
it's not the drives because they were all tested before partitioning
under an older (woody's kernel) and everything was fine (bad block
test).  
No matter how many times I run fsck, even immediately after a previous
run, it picks up the same errors along with new ones it seemingly
created in the last run. 
if there is any more information about the problem I can give just say
what's needed. I'd like to get to the bottom of this.
