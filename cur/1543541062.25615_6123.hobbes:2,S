True; but it's also no better than just using /dev/urandom......

   One bit ? I was assuming you always put in in the time difference
   between interrupts, which is surely a lot more than one bit (when it
   is there or not) Alternatively you could just run a Stream cipher
   over the input, but I guess that requires too much trust for the
   outgoing hash (just like the prng)
The "one extra bit of entropy" is the question of "do we mix this input
into the stream or not?"  If the adversary knows the input (by watching
the ethernet, for example, so he can figure out when the ethernet
interrupts will be) with 100% accuracy, the choice of whether or not to
include the interrupt adds one bit of uncertainty ("yes or no") which is
taken from the PRNG.
I misunderstood you that to you meant use the PRNG to decide at boot
time whether or not to include that irq channel for all time.  I gather
that what you meant was to use the PRNG on a per interrupt basis whether
or not to include it.  This, as I said, only adds one bit of uncertainty
from the PRNG.  Given that in the absence of any random input,
/dev/urandom eventually degrades into a PRNG, it's not *substantially*
better, but it does provide some protection.
