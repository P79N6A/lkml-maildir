When compiling any program that uses video4linux under linux
2.6.0-testANY, I always get these errors:
In file included from /usr/include/linux/videodev2.h:16,
/usr/include/linux/time.h:9: redefinition of `struct timespec'
/usr/include/linux/time.h:15: redefinition of `struct timeval'
/usr/include/time.h:160: redefinition of `struct itimerspec'
Am I doing something terribly wrong?  Simply placing an
#include <linux/time> in videodev2.h under #ifdef __KERNEL__ seems to
get rid of the compiler errors, though I'm sure that's not the proper
solution.
