No, there is not.

First up, one needs to remove the inode_update_time() call from
generic_file_aio_write_nolock() and run the tests.  If this (and noatime)
indeed makes a significant difference (probably on writethrough-caching
disks) then yup, we should do something.
`nomtime' would be simple enough.  But another option would be to arrange
for a/m/ctime dirtiness to not cause an inode writeout in fsync(). 
Instead, only sync the a/m/ctime-dirty inodes via sync, umount and pdflush.
That way, the inodes get written every thirty seconds rather than once per
second.
It's probably not standards-compliant, but shoot me.  Who cares if the
mtimes come up 30 seconds out of date after a system crash?
`nomtime' would be simpler and safer to implement, but not as nice.
But we need those numbers first.  I'll take a look.
