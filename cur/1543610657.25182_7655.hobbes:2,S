The "problem" effectively arises from _fast_ releasing "stable" versions. I
tend to think there should be a slowdown, not a speedup in stable releases,
just because the weird bugs we saw lately were all found shortly after release.
Maybe it would be a good idea to declare a good-looking pre-version "stable"
after a week delay (for testing) or so, omitting further patches.
I think there is no need to fear "bad" media appearance. It's just what makes
the difference: we try to solve the problem in case one is found _and_ talk
frankly about it. No need to hide.
It isn't really the same as shooting down XP/W2K/NT by type'ing a text-file in
a console-window...

Stephan
