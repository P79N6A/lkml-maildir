Up to now we did not experienced any fs corruption with the current patch, 
but we are missing feedback from other users, especially with heavy load
and many concurrent accesses.
We have setup an automatic testing suit using
RT tester from verified systems (our profs firm)
http://www.verified.de/rt-tester.html
 
and an ASpecT specification and are testing it extensively. 
(In fact we are looking at the test suit testing ;)
We already found&fixed some bugs, but all of 'em in the userspace utils.
We'll release a new fixed version of the utils in about a week I think.
How about inserting it as an "experimental feature"? This would perhaps increase
the feedback?
