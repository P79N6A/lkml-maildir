So you walk the inode hash to find inodes? Seems like a nice idea on
the surface.... Won't it need to hold the iprune_mutex to prevent
races with prune_icache() and invalidate_list()?
Hmmmm - what about unhashed inodes? We'll never see them with this
method of traversal. I ask because I'm working on some prototype
patches for XFS that avoid using the inode hash altogether and drive
inode lookup from the multitude of radix trees we have per filesystem
(for parallelised and lockless inode lookup).
The above scanning method would not work at all with that sort of
filesystem structure. Perhaps combining the bulk get/put with Jan's
get/put method for walking the sb inode list would be sufficient?
Cheers,
Dave.
