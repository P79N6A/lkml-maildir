C++ is a preprocessor, nothing more. Check how the original C++ compiler was
implemented.

Have a look at all the operation arrays on objects in Linux. Inodes are also
virtual classes and all the other buzzwords.

I guess it depends what you think of as object oriented. Linux has a very
clear set of abstractions to objects - inodes, files, sk_buffs. I regularly
merge several hundred K of changes with Linus and the kernel is very very
modular in the abstract sense - the number of overlapping changes is almost
nil.
