I have no idea if your project is any good or not, but the fact is that this
list is for issues regarding the linux kernel.
In general if you want people to start using your work, you need to make
sure it:
1) Will be of use for them
2) Will be of exceptional quality, so that it will be better than the
   competition, etc.
3) Try not to be an annoying bastard.
As for 1) and 2), I do not know, but in 3) your are starting to lean
toward not accomplishing it, as you keep pissing people like me off
that usually rather wont get involved in trolling.
Also, you should consider the fact that trying to publicly humiliate
someone usually points to a low self esteem ?  I do not know what
Alan Cox did to you, but do not want to read about it as:
1) It has nothing to do with me and the other people on this list - mail
   him in private if it helps you sleep at night telling him how worthless
   his is.
2) I do not give a flying f**k.
Please stop this shit, as I for one are starting to get fed up with
pointless threads that never seem to die, and just keeps filling
up my mailbox - I am sure I am not the only one.
Thanks.
