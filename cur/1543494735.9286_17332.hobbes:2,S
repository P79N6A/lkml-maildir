  Ooops. I just got reported it even can't be compiled and that guy was right.
I'm really sorry... My kernel really compiled fine but the quotas were
turned off (I accidentaly deleted my .config so I had to reconfigure kernel
and forgot to turn quotas on.. Sigh.). New version - quota-fix-2.2.7-2.diff.gz
- *really* compiles fine ;-). So Linus please apply this one..
