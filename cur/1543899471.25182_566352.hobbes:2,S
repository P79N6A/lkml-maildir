Well, that way you'd have to teach applications about suspend... Which
is quite bad.  You mentioned it -- returning random errors will be
very bad for machines like OLPC that want to suspend
automatically. Plus it is a step back from current implementation, and
ABI change, too...

Kernel threads already send _themselves_ to the refrigerator. [Plus we
put all the userland there, which is what you don't like, but kernel
can not rely on userland after suspend starts, anyway, so it should
not hurt].
Anyway.. PPC currently suspends without freezer, which puts rules on
drivers. ("Must handle i/o requests after .suspend() method is ran,
must not use GFP_KERNEL to do so, must not try to synchronously
communicate with userspace before _all_ devices are unfrozen") I am
not certain what the exact rules are, but you seem to know them. Could
we get Doc*/power/suspend_wo_freezer.txt describing them for driver
authors? That way we can make sure drivers work on ppc, too, and maybe
get rid of freezer in the long run.

This is how it works currently in -mm.
(Plus, the rule is that threads that decide _not to_ stop themselves
should not do any I/O.)
