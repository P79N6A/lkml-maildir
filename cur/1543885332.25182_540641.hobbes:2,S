I wrote up the suggestion before my first morning tea yesterday
and must admit that the name path_component_lookup is pretty stupid.
We don't just look up a component but any relative path starting
from the vfsmount/dentry pair.  How about vfs_path_lookup instead
because it mirrors various other vfs_ function that are dentry based?
Also as a new exported symbol it should get a kerneldoc comment describing
it.

This should get the same simplification I suggested for do_path_lookup.
