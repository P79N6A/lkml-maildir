Subject: [patch] PCI: disable MSI on more ATI NorthBridges

More ATI North Bridges like RS780 can't do MSI like its predecessors
in linux. Disable MSIs on them.
Signed-off-by: Shane Huang <shane.huang@amd.com>
Since there is some word wrapping problem with my mail client MS outlook
if I copy the patch into the text, so I'll have to attach the patch as
an attachment. Please check it.
Thanks
Best Regards
Shane
