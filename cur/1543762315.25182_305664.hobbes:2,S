If I understand the proposal, it would break in the following situation
(lifted from earlier email):
	rcu_read_lock();
	list_for_each_entry_rcu(p, head, list) {
		if (unlikely(p->status == DELETE_ME)) {
			spin_lock(&p->mutex);
			if (likely(p->status == DELETE_ME)) {
				p->status = DELETED;
				list_rcu(&p->list);
				call_rcu(&p->rcu, sublist_finalize_rcu);
			}
			spin_unlock(&p->mutex);
		}
	}
	rcu_read_unlock();
Here, sublist_finalize_rcu() just finds the front of the block and
kfree()s it.
Here is the scenario:
	CPU 1				CPU 2
	task 1 does rcu_read lock
					task 2 does rcu_read_lock
	task 1 sees DELETE_ME
					task 2 sees DELETE_ME
	task 1 acquires the lock
					task 2 blocks/spins on lock
	task 1 does call_rcu
	task 1 releases lock
	task 1 does rcu_read_unlock()
					task 2 acquires lock
	RCU puts the callback on global list
	RCU invokes callback, kfree()!!!
					task 2 now sees garbage!!!
Callbacks cannot be invoked until all RCU read-side critical sections
that were in process at the time of the rcu_callback() have all
completed.
						Thanx, Paul
