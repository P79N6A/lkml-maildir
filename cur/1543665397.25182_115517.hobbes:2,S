Yup, that's the problem and the fix; the only issue is the the one
which Daniel pointed out:

The fix in userspace would be for du and find (the two programs most
likely to care about this sort of thing) to pull into memory a large
chunks of the directory at a time, sort them by inode, and then stat
them in inode order.
The only other way around it would be to do maintain an entirely
separate B-tree on disk just for the benefit of readdir(), which could
be in inode sort order.  Readdir() could then traverse the tree in
inode sort order, thus solving the performance penalty.  (The b-tree
has to be on disk, since for large directories, we can't afford to fit
it on disk.)

Nope.  That's not it.  Inode numbers are allocated sequentially in the
inode table blocks.  You can't get any more dense that that.  Create a
bunch of inodes in a directory like this:
mke2fs -j -F -b 1024 -g 1024 -N 1200000 test.img
mount -t ext3 -o loop test.img /mnt
pushd /mnt
mkdir test test2 test3
cd test
time seq -f "%06.0f" 1 100  | xargs touch
cd ..
cd test2
time seq -f "%06.0f" 1 10000  | xargs touch
cd ..
cd test3
time seq -f "%06.0f" 1 100000  | xargs touch
cd ..
popd
Then look at the result using "ls -li".  You will see that the inode
numbers are all sequentially allocated, when you look at the inodes in
creation order (which in this particular case is in filename sort
order ).  The problem is that when you look at them in hash sort
order, the inode numbers are scattered all over the place.

I'm not all convinced that splattering the inodes all over the volume
is in fact a good thing, because it means splattering the block
allocation for files within the same directory all over the volume.
Arguably, read access to files in a directory is much more common than
the "du" or "find" case.  So if we need to make trade-off in one
direction or another, I'd much rather go with striving to maximize
block locality than making a readdir+stat run go fast.  This is
especially true since there *is* a user space workaround that would
speed up things for du and find.
