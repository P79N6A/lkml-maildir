What hardware, chipsets, situations, etc did the previous code not work
on?
There is no avoiding the fact you need some kind of per-IDE controller
data for the clock for that particular PCI device.
I believe there are systems with 33mhz pci and 50mhz pci. Trying to find a
'common' base clock just seems to be an excercise in confusion. The only
thing that really makes sense is 'how fast is said PCI device clocked'.
