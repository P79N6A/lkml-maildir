It is the second tarball extraction from cache that suffers data
corruption, not a network error.  I am in process of narrowing
down cause as I now have 2.4.32-pre3 and 2.6.13-rc6-git3 .configs
that work okay (5 tarball extracts, diff okay)on reiserfs and ext2.
Something to do with MTRR, highmem (box has 1GB), unwanted MP
detection in dmesg --> no longer network, filesystem and/or SATA
driver directly, dunno what yet, but tedious process of elimination
will take time.
How do I force fetching tarball from over NFS again?  At present
the repeat extractions are from memory, not from network.
Cheers,
Grant.
