Subject: [PATCH] Make scsi.h nominally userspace-clean
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/9/222

As Joerg Schilling, the author of cdrecord, has noted in threads such as
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0309.3/1355.html
 and
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0408.0/0799.html,
scsi/scsi.h does not compile cleanly in userspace programs due to its use of
``u8''.  I have confirmed this bug and prepared and tested a fix that simply
changes all such uses to ``__u8''.  Please consider for inclusion.
I do not argue that including this header file in a program is appropriate, but
other kernel headers already take as many precautions as this patch introduces.
I chose __u8 over uint8_t as more in the style of the kernel generally.
Please keep me on cc:; I do not subscribe to the lists.
