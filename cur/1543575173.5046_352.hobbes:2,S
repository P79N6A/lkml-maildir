Mostly at the out-of-sync/not-all-errors-documented kind of places and amount
of fun involved in getting them in sync with the tree (and with each other,
for that matter). Oh, well...

Grabbed it. BTW, if you still have 1.7, 1.10, 1.13 and 1.14...  I've managed
to dig the rest out, but these seem to be gone (looks like a modified 1.10
is out there, but...)
I was thinking about putting the whole bunch under the CVS.  If you have
the missing ones somewhere and could send an URL...
BTW, could we finally lose mpx(2)? Very few programs used it under v7 and
that experiment had been abandoned early in 80s, so it's not like we needed
it for porting. phys(2) is already gone (not from unimplemented(2), though),
so we have a precedent of removing such stuff.
