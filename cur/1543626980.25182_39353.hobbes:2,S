Pavel,
 maybe I was unclear. For reasons of interactivity, I do not have any
swap enabled on my Notebook. The 320 MB are enough for my workload and I
am willing to accept the OOM Killer when I do really stupid things. If I
enable swap the (all of them to some degree :-) VM decides to swap out
"unused" processes. Most of them are desktop related and if I need them
the system responds sluggish. Therefore - no swap activated.
 My question was: can I have a system without active swap and still use
swsusp? Creating a swap/suspend partition of appropriate size is not a
problem. I just do not want to "swapon" it.
Martin
