Assuming I've understood you correctly about generic support, yes. I
used the 3 above with Linux arm systems that were interfaced to them
via gpio. The matrix displays had just 128x64 so the 8x gpio_set_value
penalty wasn't a biggie. The E-Ink displays range from 800x600 to
1200x826 so the 16x gpio_set_value became a bottleneck. In terms of
generic support, the Broadsheet display controller is also used on
i.MX31 and SC2410/2440 boards so those platform drivers (assuming
those good folks submit them, (i've only written and submitted
am300epd.c)) should also benefit.
Thanks,
