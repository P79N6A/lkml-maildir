But most people are not capable of fllowing that article - or they
wouldn't be asking here whatever their intention.

Thats in progress actually and hopefully then in the hypervisor case
implementing irrevocably read-only pages.

Always wrongly. You can't be sure the table format will not change, you
can't reliably restore the table and its virtually impossible to do any
kind of trace reliably this way as you end up with two copies of the data
from user space which may vary (and leads to bad problems - see BSD
recently).
