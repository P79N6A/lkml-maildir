I thought about speculations that involve other variables that may be
performed before the 'mov', or in parallel with the 'mov' and results used
after the 'mov'. This makes your rmb() just miss the train.

I wrote "/around/ the 'mov'" and it seemed obvious to me that this
also included code that is executed /inside/ the locked region.
Anyway, this code seems broken facing trivial scenario as the following:
(FIX ME)
...
READ A that is something modified inside the locked region
movl $0,%0
Let the processor reorder operations:
...
movl $0,%0
READ A
What we may want to ensure (I do :) ), at least, is that all pending 
operations be completed before we go out of the locked region.
The current IA32 architectureS guarantee writes from a CPU to be observed
in the same order as _program_ order by other CPUs. But they seem very
permissive or intend to be so about reads in cached regions for
performance considerations.
May-be the offending 'unlock' using a simple 'mov' still work on P6 since
Intel is careful at allowing broken software to still work. ;) 
How much for a specific kernel config option like CONFIG_ROUDIER ? :o)
