Yes.  The local allows us to choose to accept ExtInt interrupts or not.
We can't do it per vector but we can do by interrupt delivery path.
External Interrupt.
External NMI.
Logical Apic Bus (Although I don't know if we can disable this one).

We should only have a single cpus local apic configured to accept the
interrupt.  Further it would not surprise me if there was some first
come first served logic with accepting the interrupt in there
somewhere.

Yes.  This sounds like a BIOS bug at present.  A chipset feature
residing in the CPUs was not enabled properly.

This is a broadcast for legacy mode interrupts which don't have a cpu
destination field.  Once we are running the timer through the ioapic
we have a destination field and the broadcast logic should not matter.

Well the local apics.   If you are in ioapic mode and give the
cpus a choice of which cpu to deliver to it is a hardware anycast irq
transmission.  That is the hardware magically picks one cpu of the
set of allow cpus to deliver the irq to.  How that happens is
implementation specific.
