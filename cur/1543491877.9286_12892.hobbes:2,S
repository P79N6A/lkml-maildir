Thanks Stephen, I understand, it is all so clear now!

Files on block devices _are_ mmapable.  Or they should be.  One imagines
that files on /dev/ramdisk map the memory directly, but I could be
wrong.  Isn't there a ROM variation on this that embedded systems use?

And on non-Intel?  This fine distinction (bitops vs. arithmetic) does
not seem to be consistent across architectures.

Fortunately temporary mappings are required for the minority of IOs on
<1G machines.
And the mappings can be made very fast when required.  We can avoid
flushing the TLB contexts by using a circular buffer of mappings, and
only flushing when we wrap around that buffer.

I was about to complain about the dynamic mapping overhead.
But then I though of the brilliant TLB-flush-avoiding strategy above :)
You haven't said how to get the _bus_ addresses for DMA though.
I haven't seen a portable phys_to_bus yet...

1. Sometimes an address passed to a system call does not have an associated
pte.  Dave Miller once pointed out that the Sparc port handles the
direct-mapped kernel area in the TLB miss handler without tables.
Occasionally, a system call is called with such an address.
2. ioremap is what a framebuffer will use in general.
So our example has to support reverse-translation of ioremap ranges.

I agree that with a few ifs and elses, getting the physical address is
easy, for all addresses that a system call may be passed.
We may also assume that any device that is mmaped doesn't have to be
accessed through the readl/writel I/O macros.

Ahh, nicely settled in now.
Time to solicit some visitors methinks.
Anyone in the St Genis-Pouilly area? :)
