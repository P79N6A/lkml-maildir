hm.   What happened if the futex was in anonymous memory (vm_file==NULL)?

Neat.

Why is that guaranteed??  Another thread could be scribbling on it while
the kernel is walking it?
Why use a list and not just a sparse array? (realloc() works..)

Oh.  I'm surprised that glibc cannot just add the futex to the list prior
to acquiring it, then the exit-time code can work out whether the futex was
really taken-and-contended.  Even if the kernel makes a mistake it either
won't find a futex there or it won't wake anyone up.
I think the patch breaks the build if CONFIG_FUTEX=n?
The patches are misordered - with only the first patch applied, the kernel
won't build.  That's a nasty little landmine for git-bisect users.
Why do we need sys_get_robust_list(other task)?
