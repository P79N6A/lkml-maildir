Yes, I agree that it needs to be made much easier to create a
subdirectory in sysfs using the driver model.  I even filed a bug about

It's on my TODO list for 2.7, if that makes you feel any better.  And if
you want to try to implement it before I get to it, that would be great.
Sorry I don't have a solution for you to do this with today :(
