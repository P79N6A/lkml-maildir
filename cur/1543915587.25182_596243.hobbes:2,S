I quoted the standard and it does not say anything about AF_UNSPEC.  So
you cannot simply make such broad statements.
I also don't say that this behavior should be removed.  It's certainly
useful, very much so in fact.
But the spec calls for a "null address" to be used and that's in my
understanding something different from using AF_UNSPEC.
I looked through Stevens TCP Illustrated Vol 2 and it seems not to
mention resetting the address at all.  The POSIX spec certainly got this
text from .1g.
I cannot test it on other systems.  If somebody has access to some
certified systems (and maybe others), write a bit of code which creates
a DGRAM socket, connect to one address, call connect with a "null
address", then connect to another address (which likely has to use a
different interface since otherwise the connect will just succeed, it
seems).
