	Yes, I can see market for such beasts.  Right now the de-facto
	model for "networked" disks is FiberChannel.
	How exactly would STP interface differ from FC ?
	E.g. how STP would be better than FC ?
	(Semiob technology comment:  These days embedded market
	 has things like PowerPC on a chip with heaps of fancy
	 peripherals -- like 4xFE, or 2xSTM-1 ATM, MMUs, timers,
	 DRAM interfaces, etc.. having a gigabit serial interface
	 there isn't very big leap onwards)
