    Which video card do you have? I'm using matroxfb with a Matrox Mystique
and have no problem at all with the scrollback. As soon as I scroll back,
the little logo disappear and I can see previous kernel messages. An I
really think the penguin logo is cute, but it's a good idea to allow people
to save 8K.
