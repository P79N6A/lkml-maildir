I haven't tried it with 2.6 since this incident. But considering that 
the machine in question crashed a couple of times afterwards, it may 
well be, that a hardware fault caused this initially. But I simply don't 
dare to put 2.6 again on this machine as I've no real backup of most of 
the data, and restoring some 100 gb from cds is really annoying.
