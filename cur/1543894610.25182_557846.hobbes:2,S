No, Andi. It's broken.
We're speaking of a 32-bit ioctl compat routine. I would say it's more
than 'convention' that the structure used by the compat_ioctl routine
actually matches the 'real' structure as it gets laid out on the 32-bit
architecture.
The 'real' structure as used by the 32-bit userspace does not have the
'packed' attribute. Thus the u64 member of the structure is aligned to 8
bytes on _all_ relevant 32-bit architectures except for i386.
By adding 'packed' in the compat_ioctl routine, you cause it to expect a
structure which does not match what userspace is using, for all non-x86
architectures. That's kind of not very compatible. I call that 'broken'.
