Hehehe.  I've got 13Gig of space, but unfortunately it is in
massive disarray right now and I can't seem to find the time to
clean it up.  ;o)
I'd try out e2compr however I don't want to risk any data until
it is built into the kernel tree proper.
Someone sent me a solution allready that I'll try out.  I'm sure
it'll work great.
Take care,
TTYL
