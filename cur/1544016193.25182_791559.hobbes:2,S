It is up to user to decide, exactly the same will happen if you tune the
oom_adj for the task.

No, you can not. Did you try that? The only sane way to use oom_adj is
to disable oom killer for the task or make its score very small or very
big, there is really no way to make a finegrained tuning, since score
changes and userspace does not know the algorithm.

No, that's not what it does. Patch allows to select process with the
highest score among those who have appropriate name. Please check it
twice.

Please check the patch first. It selects process according to the
badness, check memory group first and fallbacks to scan other processes
if process with the given name was not found or name is null.
User does not work with the some magically calculated scores, he just
starts the processes and knows only their names. User can specify pid,
but in the case of short-living connections it is not possible. Changing
parent oom score opens a huge possibility to kill it, while in case of
some application server (or database) it should never be killed, and
only some of its clients (which work for the users and not for the
calculating backend for example) have to be killed.
There is no way to implement it with short-living pids (they are
unknown, if inotify worked with the /proc it could be doable though,
except that special daemon is needed) and can not change the parent's
score as was suggested.
You claim that existing scheme works, but in practice it does not.
So I created a patch which somehow makes the solution closer. It is not
perfect, but it works compared to what was suggested from the
theoretical point of view.
