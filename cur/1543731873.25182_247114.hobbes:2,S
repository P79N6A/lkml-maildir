I could see retrying 2 or 3 times, but 8 times does seem to be a bit
much, agreed.

If the block gets successfully read after 2 or 3 tries, it might be a
good idea for the kernel to automatically do a forced rewrite of the
block, which should cause the disk to do its own disk block
sparing/reassignment.
