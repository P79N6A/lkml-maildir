	If you have Magic SysRq enabled, would that do the job prior
to suspend?  Typically with Pavel's swsusp package, I hit the Alt-SysRq-s
before hitting Alt-SysRq-d to suspend him.  Does Alt-SysRq-s synchronize
a raid?  Of course, at that point, the choice to take the "_loong_ time"
is in user space - meat space, user space - since I chose to hit that
key combination.

	What does the Alt-SysRq-s combination do about networks then?
