The kernel does not allow using clone() directly because some
additional functionality required to implement the correct POSIX
threads behaviour is missing.  Do you think we make these things slow
on purpose?
If you want to see this changes get the kernel changes in place.
There are various patches floating around which combined will allow a
correct and fast implementation.  But they were not added.
