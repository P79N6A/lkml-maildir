I would rather if it's gonna be a mess it's, then we put that mess in
userspace rather than in the kernel.

For the most part it's not for the BIOS though AFAICT.  It's for some
hacky little microcontroller that controls fans and similar things
that Dell won't give up details for.

It's for old hardware, I'm not sure it will evolve much other than
just for maintenance.
It's really hard to say, maybe if Dell gave more details about the
userspace we would have a better idea?
