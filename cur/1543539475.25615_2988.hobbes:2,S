I tried to boot linux-2.4.0-test4. It uses a ramdisk for the initial
root. It uses the BusLogic.o and sd.o to mount the final root file-
system. These compiled as modules fine, and were properly included
within the initrd image.
It fails to mount the root-file system with the errors:
BusLogic.o couldn't find the kernel version the module was compiled for
sd.o couldn't find the kernel version the module was compiled for
This system uses:
	insmod version 2.1.121
	depmod (Linux modutils) 2.1.121
Maybe these are incompatible???
Also, attempts to compile some drivers that use:
	wait_queue_head_t
... now fail to compile, even though there is a definition in
/usr/include/linux/wait.h. It seems that something else has to
be #defined because there are a lot of strange new MACROS since
the last compile that used linux-2.3.39. Does anybody know what
has to be done??
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
