You can go to 
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/linux/kernel/2.6.x/2.6.0-test11
 and
apply the patches to plain -rc1 in order as described in the readme file.
Once the patch which kills the driver is identified, I should be able to
clean my mess. 
(if someone knows a retail store in Paris where r8169 clones are available,
please drop me a mail, thanks)
