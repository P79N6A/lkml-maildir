One of the -mm patches produces a warning which will be taken care of later when
all the network drivers are converted to dynamically allocating net_device's.
At that point, a massive patch will be needed that changes all instances of:
	unregister_netdev(dev);
	my cleanup...
	kfree(dev);   // becomes release_netdev(dev);
new release_netdev() will release the dev kobject at that point.
I have the code ready, just been waiting till all net device's converted.
Prefer not to break the world at this point.
