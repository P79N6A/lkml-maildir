I found with one of my hdd's (A Quantum Bigfoot) the others a WD 8.4gig
caviar and had no such prob with it ..
hwoever the problem is, on any other kernel. 2.1.132, 2.0.0-pre1
2.0.37-pre3 and earlier I got around 6.7meg/sec out of it (using hdparm's
tests) maybe not the best tests.. however in 2.0.37-pre4 i got a slow 1.83
out ofit constantly.. it even performed very slowly in large empty fle
writes whe i oved back a kernel.. it worked as well as it ever did. and
the 2.1.132/2.0.0-pre1 mix.. worked perfectly with that..
anyone noticd a degredation with certain drive types?
Information about IDE controller and drive model:
PIIX3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX3: not 100ative mode: will probe irqslater
       ide0: BM-DMA at 0xffa0-0xffa7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
       ide1: BM-DMA at 0xffa8-0xffaf, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
Dec 29 20:14:11 jim kernel: hda: WDC AC38400L, ATA DISK drive
Dec 29 20:14:11 jim kernel: hdc: QUANTUM BIGFOOT_CY4320A, ATA DISK drive
and the details for the IDE bus as from /proc/pci:
IDE interface: Intel 82371SB PIIX3 IDE (rev 0).
    Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  Master Capable.
    Latency=32.
    I/O at 0xffa0 [0xffa1].
    Bus  0, device  18, function  0:
Anyone else have any problems with similar drive/controller combinations
under 2.0.37pre4 with the new IDE code?
Regards, Jim.
