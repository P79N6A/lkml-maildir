I like the idea behind the patch, but we shouldn't be calling it 
unconditionally. We're bound to run into some suprises that could really 
kill us this late in the 2.6 game. 
I do think it should go in, as long as there is a flag telling the core 
whether or not to call shutdown for that particular device. I think it 
could also be extended to include a power state, so the core could suspend 
the device before removing the module. 
The default would always be 'Do Nothing', but with a per-device sysfs 
file, a developer/user/gui app could be used to set the policy from user 
space.
