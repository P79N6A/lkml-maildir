Hi Jeff,
After I gave up fiddling with "ideX=???" options, an alternative
possibility just occurred to me, looking at this dmesg output from libata:
ata_piix version 1.02
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:1f.2 to 64

wouldn't it be nice if I could specify somehow to skip the "ata2" instance
and leave the 0x170/0x376 resource to be allocated by IDE, which would be
compiled as a module? Or, once probed and allocated (but not in use) I
could tell the driver to "release" a particular instance and free all
resources? I think this is not possible with the current infrastructure
and, seeing you want to get rid of this conflict altogether, it is
unlikely you would be interested in adding such support, right?
Kind regards
Tigran
