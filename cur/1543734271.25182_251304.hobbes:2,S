It is done so - user space daemon (with binary part) interacts with ALSA
drivers.

There was such approach, but seems it was wrong.

This should be possible (don't check yet). But the problem here was
that AMD64 machines are usually based on non-Intel chipsets
(VIA, NVidia), supports for those chipsets were added to ALSA just in
last days. Now it may be tested with recent version of ALSA.
