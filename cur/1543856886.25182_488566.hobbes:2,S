Oh for gawd's sake.
If you want to allocate a page from within the first 1/4 of a zone, and if
all those pages are in use for something else then you'll need to run
reclaim against the first 1/4 of that zone.  Or fail the allocation.  Or
run reclaim against the entire zone.  The second two options are
self-evidently dumb.
