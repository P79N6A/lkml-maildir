You have i82365 enabled? You should have CONFIG_PCMCIA=y,
CONFIG_CARDBUS=y, CONFIG_I82365=n.
Hmm.. I haven't tried the module version - are you by any chance using
the core PCMCIA as a module, and then the yenta (CONFIG_CARDBUS) support
is compiled into the kernel? I haven't tried that combination, it probably
doesn't work.
