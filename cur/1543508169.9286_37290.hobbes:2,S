[7am uncaffeinated disclaimer applies to the following]
Why should the inode's ctime be changed? Nothing is actually happening to the
inode, it's just directory contents which are being altered. Though by that
logic the directory mtime should be changed, not the ctime. Uhhuh. I'm going
to go back to sleep for a bit ;-)
