Thank you. You should find most of your latency concerns you brought up have 
been addressed by this change.

Not sure what you mean by that. It's still a fair distribution system, it's 
just that nice -10 has quite a bit more cpu allocated than nice 0. Eventually 
if you throw enough load at it it will slow down too.

You will find that is the case already with this version. Even under heavy 
load if you were to be running one server niced (say httpd nice 19 in the 
presence of mysql nice 0) the latencies would be drastically reduced compared 
to mainline behaviour. I am aware this becomes an issue for some heavily 
loaded servers because some servers run multithreaded while others do not, 
forcing the admins to nice their multithreaded ones.
