Alan,
   Could you please include a an inline memcpy patch for 2.2.17.
I'm one of those clueless people that moved to gcc-2.96 (via
RedHat Rawhide) and got bit by this problem.  I'm not going to
even begin to pretend I know enough  about the kernel or inlining
functions to suggest a patch so for not being part of the solution
I apologize.
Thanks,
- Jeff
