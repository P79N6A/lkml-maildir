You're right, but so is Ingo's patch.  We're not trying to enforce some notion 
of absolute time, just  make it possible for userspace to guarantee that time 
cannot be *observed* to travel backwards.  It's still the responsibility of the 
user to use proper synchronization in multithreaded apps.  Without the smp_rmb() 
it would be possible on some architectures for the results of the race you 
describe to leak across other lock-prefixed instructions used to ensure 
monotonicity in userspace.  Relativity applies to SMP timekeeping, not just 
space travelers, so if there's no way to prove a race occurred, it doesn't 
matter whether or not it occurred in some frame of reference.
