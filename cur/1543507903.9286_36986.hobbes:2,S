    Hi all,
    Anybody knows why the IO bandwidth on a NT Intel box is that much
limited? Why it is that hard to get even close to 100 Mbyte/sec, if the
theoretical bandwidth of PCI can be much higher? like: 66Mhz x 32bit bus
= 66Mhz x4 byte = 266 Mbyte/sec?
    What cause this difference between theoretical and practical
bandwidth? is it CPU, chipset, or cache coherence mechanism?
Is it just the ugly Operating System? Is possible to get more on a Linux
on Intel machine? On an Sgi/Irix, with THE SAME PCI bus you can easily
get over 200 Mbyte/sec...
    What is the best disk read bandwidth on a Linux you have ever seen?
on which hardware?
Maybe the new Linux SGI file system (efs = xfs) is going to improve
this, or is it a hardware limitation of Intel boxes?.....
    Lot of questions here.... put in your two cents of worth, please ;)
Best regards,
David, Roman.
