Yep, here it is the same, although my machines have not such an
huge throughput of news as yours. The memory leak doesn't appear
any more, definitely after 2-3 days since 2.2.13pre[34].
During heavy load I pushed it higher by compiling the kernel with
"make -j" and all worked perfectly, I monitored the memory usage
with "top -d 0.5", no leak anymore.

As far as I can see it was a "real bug" (tm) in 2.2.12.
