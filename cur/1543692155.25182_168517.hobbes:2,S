you didn't build in emu10k1 driver.  so, at that stage, there is
really no available card :)

yep, this should be avoided before root is mounted.

yes, but only if you set up /etc/modprobe.conf correctly to load the
modules automatically.
at least, you have to specify which card is the first one
(snd-card-0).
i recommend you either to build all ALSA stuffs as modules or to build
them into the kernel.
