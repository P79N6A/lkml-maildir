This is perfectly normal behaviour:
1) on your system, you have no process limit configured for
   yourself so you can start processes until all resources
   (memory, file descriptors, ...) are used
2) when all processes are used, there really is no way the
   kernel can buy you more hardware on ebay and install it
   on the fly ... all it can do is start failing allocations
On production systems, good admins setup per-user limits for
the various resources so no single user is able to run the
system into the ground.
regards,
Rik
