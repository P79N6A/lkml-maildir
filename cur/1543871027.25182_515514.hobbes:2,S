Yes, it is key issue. I think it is not silly to want to set up the
UART before RTS is enabled.
It is going not about some random RTS behaviour, but about the
question how to ask the
kernel just don't touch RTS signal. As I understand the current kernel
implementation
doesn't give a chance to do it.
I wrote about it also several days ago here:
http://groups.google.de/group/linux.kernel/browse_thread/thread/82e61dccd11c9e3f/b03971c074609c95?lnk=gst&q=Kebkal&rnum=1&hl=ru#b03971c074609c95
Maybe it would be more relevant to write it in this topic.
