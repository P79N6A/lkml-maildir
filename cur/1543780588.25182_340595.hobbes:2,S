Hmm, that sounds like an architecture specific extension above the
basic requirements.

They do this because:
1. they want to control when this RAM is freed.
2. remap_pfn_range refuses to map RAM that isn't marked reserved.
To put it another way, they fiddle with the reserved bit because
that's what the current interfaces forces upon them.  I would
dearly like that to go away though.

This sounds like i386 is doing something which is a superset of the
base requirements, which is an architecture specific extension.  No
problem with that, but that's i386 folk's problem. 8)
Ok, but I still disagree with replacing something called reserved
with something which leads one to believe that it's intended for
checking whether a struct page is "valid" RAM or not when there's
other interfaces which are supposed to be used for that.
I wonder if we can optimise out the useless "valid" RAM checks
on architectures which don't require this insanity...
