>>And I agree we should stop this thread now.
One thing that seems consistent here is that most agree on this point. 
To add a bit of comedy, picture this at the place you work:
Mistakenly, a broadcast email goes out to everyone (ooops should have 
restricted the total number of users in the to/cc/bcc fields). Then 
your IT security group sends out a broadcast telling everyone to delete 
it and not to "reply to all." You continue to get people replying to 
all with the body as below:
"Didn't you see the IT security bulletin? It said not to reply to all 
but to delete this email!"
I am sensing that is what we are all doing here :) (myself included).
