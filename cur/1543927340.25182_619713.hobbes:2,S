Were you trying to be funny or something? You aren't really suggesting
that I don't know what a debug level is, and how pr_debug() works, are
you?

It's perfectly correct: developers can add "#define DEBUG" manually
before they build the code. That it's an idiom you don't seem to *like*
is distinct from correctness.
OK, can we stop now? David, you need to learn how to work with the
community. The way you keep discussing every word of every reply is
very unpleasant and not constructive at all. Whenever someone reviews
your code, he or she is giving you something. You should be thankful
for the help you received. Instead of that, it looks like you try to
defend yourself against him/her. Please stop working against people
reviewing your code, and start working _with_ them.
Thanks,
