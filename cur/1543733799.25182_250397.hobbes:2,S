It's still overridable from userspace, I'd think. But having a sensible
default in the kernel makes a crapload of sense to me. We have better
faster access to data from there - if there are really things that aren't
just parameters to the tuning algorithm it'd have to repeatedly poke 
values into hard overrides. Do-able, but not what we want by default,
I'd think.
