The difference between the tasklist_lock and task_lock is that task_lock 
is not an interrupt lock.
Think about signal delivery during exec.
Do you want to replace tasklist_lock with task_lock in exit_sighand() 
and during exec, or do you want to add task_lock to tasklist_lock?
Hmm.
Someone removed the read_lock(tasklist_lock) around 
send_specific_sig_info() - which lock synchronizes exec and signal delivery?
