It actually was a nice feature and what I have seen so far look like bad 
regression and makes the gas macros totally useless. Before it was possible 
to define some pseudo assembly instructions, but if one can't pass some 
simple address operand without quotes as an argument anymore...

Well, at that the time I wrote it, it very nicely cleaned up the old code 
(which was even worse) and made additions very simple. The recursive macros 
avoided a lot of simple typos. I'm not really happy that I have to change 
that, it worked fine so far.
BTW I'm back in a few days and my online connectivity is rather limited right 
now, so I hadn't really a good possibility to research the possible options 
yet.
bye, Roman
