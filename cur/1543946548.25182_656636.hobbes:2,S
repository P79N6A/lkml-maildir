Did those jobs share nodes -- sometimes two or more jobs using the same
nodes?  I am sure SGI has such users too, though such job mixes make
the runtimes of specific jobs less obvious, so customers are more
tolerant of variations and some inefficiencies, as they get hidden in
the mix.
In other words, Rik, both yes and no ;).  Both sorts of HPC loads
exist, sharing nodes and a dedicated set of nodes for each job.
