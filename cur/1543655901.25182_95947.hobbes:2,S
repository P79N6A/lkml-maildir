	This was self-inflicted.  When I removed the spontaneous
partition table rereading code from devfs, I did not notice that
get_removal_partition does a read_unlock(&parent->u.dir.lock), so I
was leaving a read lock in place where I deleted the call to this
routine.  Sorry for wasting anyone else's time with it.
