	In the past when this has happened to me on overclocked machines what
generally appears to happen is that one process gets 'stuck' on one CPU, and
most other processes get scheduled on to the other CPU.  Unfortunately if it
gets stuck when there is some spinlock in the kernel being used I think the
kernel gets locked somehow and you can't do things like shutdown the machine
properly, which is kind of an aggregvation, but, well, Intel/PC hardware in
general wasn't meant to suddenly loose a processor... :)
