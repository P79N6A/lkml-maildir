.. but you can fix that. Several ways. Make up your own names. Make it
have "/dev/the-cd-with-the-blue-faceplate" if you want, and it will all
still work quite intuitively.
And when you switch the hardware around, and the CD-ROM breaks and you
replace it with another one (still with a blue face-plate, just to not
confuse the user unnecessarily, but this time it ends up being on another
bus entirely), the "/dev/the-cd...-faceplate" thing still works with
minimal effort on the admin part.
And it works in _all_ situations.
Sure, you can have all programs use their own random naming scheme and use
.cdrecordrc and edit that instead, but then you have to remember to edit
the .k3drc thing too, and the /etc/fstab, and so on and so on.
Isn't it saner to use a naming scheme that everybody can agree on, and
that is generic enough that it really _does_ work for everybody, and that
allows localised names?
