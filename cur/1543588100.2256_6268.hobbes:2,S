OK, partitions are already handeled!
One additional thing: I am thinking were to put the configuration
detection code. For now I will try to put it at the end of md_init().
But I still have to figure out how I can read the config sector and
start a new md.
An API interface for that would also be great! My solution can only be
an ugly work-around. md_init() just seems not to be the right function
for that.

Wilfried
PS: I do not want to flood lkml with my stuff. Should we discuss this in
