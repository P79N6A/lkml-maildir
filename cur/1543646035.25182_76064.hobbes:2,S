   The following patch removes the deprecated
   IPV6_ADDRFORM socket option from 2.5.40. I checked
   OpenBSD & FreeBSD and both do not support this option,
   so I think its safe to remove.
Are we absolutely sure no applications use this?
Also, if you are going to fix the indentation in the header
file, please do so in a seperate patch.  Thanks.
