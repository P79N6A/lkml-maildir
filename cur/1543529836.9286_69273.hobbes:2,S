yep - and the 'natural blocking' of memcpys is bound (in size) anyway, so
the conditional reschedule is probably faster (and an already proven
solution). I believe there is one more reason to allow a memcpy to finish
before rescheduling: the source buffer is often (especially in the
networking case) already cached, so we are better off if we wait 100 usecs
and reschedule _after_ the memcpy.
