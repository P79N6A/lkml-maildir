If we're limited to Linux kernels, this seems to not be the case. Great 
care is taken in keeping this userspace ABI stable -- new system calls 
are given new numbers. Old system calls may disappear (after a long 
grace period) but even then I don't believe the number is ever recycled.
If your discussion is not limited to Linux kernels, then sure, but being 
portable at that (sub-libc) level is asking too much.

Some, but your supposition seems unclear.
