Not to belabor the point, but most SpecWeb runs also turn off features
like timestamps, window scaling, sack, etc. ie. things you sometimes
need in the real world. 
That's representative of the problem, really. They could probably
work up a fw/hw implementation for a specific workload, benchmark...
Its much harder to be general purpose, feature rich, fully compliant
in hw than in sw.
