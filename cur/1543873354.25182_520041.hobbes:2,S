Bisecting went well, after 13 compiles this commit was found:

    [PATCH] Fix CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO
    I wouldn't mind if CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO went away entirely.  But if it's there,
    it should work properly.  Currently it's quite haphazard: both real vma and
    fixmap are mapped, both are put in the two different AT_* slots, sysenter
    returns to the vma address rather than the fixmap address, and core dumps yet
    are another story.
    This patch makes CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO disable the real vma and use the fixmap
    area consistently.  This makes it actually compatible with what the old vdso
    implementation did.

I had both CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO=y and CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=y configured.
