'It crashed.'
[Spend hour teaching and end user to patch kdb]
'It crashed, it says foo, but this fsck took hours so I dont have time to help
 more'
[Bug goes unfixed for 2 months because it only happens on a revision 8 card
 which the maintainer doesnt]

Programming isnt the problem to me - its debugging. I get a lot of awful patches
that have good debugging behind them. That debugging is the valuable part. I
used to reach each of Andrea's patches to find out what the bug was rather than
how he fixed it for example (nowdays I tend to apply his patches of course)
For things like driver debugging its the only way to work. Hardware simply does
not work like the manual says and no amount of Zen contemplation will ever 
make you at one with a 3c905B ethernet card. 
In many ways good crash dump tools and tracebacks (oopses do not count) are
the valuable bit - remote gdb happens to be a passable crash dump tool
