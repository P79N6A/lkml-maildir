I have many other, simpler things in my set:
- Fix for bad AT_PLATFORM on HT Xeons
- check_gcc for x86
- separate config option for PII (yes some still have that and does not hurt)
- CONFIG_NR_CPUS
- hfsplus driver (first will talk to maintainer if he cares...)
And a ton of possibly fixes I have collected over time, but someone would have
to review them.
Don't know if there is any chance to get them in, but...I will send to the list.
