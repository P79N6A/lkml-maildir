I've been working on this myself. Unfortunately the box I was using for devel 
has died and the start I made on the work was lost several months ago when I 
had a hard drive die on me. (I really need to go buy a UPS and a better surge 
protector - the box I was doing devel on bought it in a lightning strike and 
the hard drive I had used as a backup just died)

Yeah - this is why the work I was doing kept the old vgacon around and used 
fbcon on those platforms that needed it (unchanged). My plan was to add a 
graphics system that would "take over" from the boot console when it was 
ready to take over.
