Subject: eepro100 with 2.2.14, and 2.3.39 slot problem ! ( BUG?)

hello everyone , 
i just reread the whole thread and saw someone say he moved the card from a
shared isa/pci 
slot to another and it fixed the problem 
Just worked for me . 
this means there is a specific situation localised to A machine which is
reproduced 
only when a card is in a shared slot . 
In my case it is a tyan fx mb with a pii266 
but i also reproduced the problem on a asus p2b-f 
anyways this should be fixed if it is software fixable. 
I have a firewall, running 3 ethernet cards and one scsi card on a 5 pci
slot motherboard . 
Now with this i have no choice but to put the scsi card on the shared slot ,
since you should never use the first pci slot if you have an agp card in . 
thats the machine with the asus p2bf in my case . 
I actually realised the problem was the slot when i read the mail and
remembered only 1 out of 3 eepro's was behaving. 
comments ? 
Does anyone need any more info on this ? I ll be glad to provide . 
PS whoever has the problem with 2214/15pre should check this as i am
convinced slot change ( if appropriate ) 
should fix it for now.
