I have 2 SMP-Boards and both need noapic. One is from 2001 (AUSUS CUR-DLS),
one is from June 2006 (Gigabyte M57SLI-S4).
There are many reasons:
1. Bugs which have such a simple workaround don't get much attention.
2. Usually SMP boards are used for machines, which just HAVE to work,
   since they have been expensive. These are not consumer boards.
3. I usually had only USB problems (no IRQ), if ommiting noapic.
   USB technology is a cosumer grade technology and enterprise
   grade developers don't have much interest in it (until now?).
4. IRQ routing setup is often a BIOS issue. You might be able
   to fix that by upgrading your BIOS. That often needs a Windows
   tool. Linux people not always (want to) have access to Windows :-)
I reported the all the problems (starting 2001), no developer 
seemed interested.
I can report them against the latest RC6 kernel tomorrow and put them
into bugzilla, if we now REALLY care.
