Sure - because it doesn't hurt anything, someone just *might* find it
useful one day, and mostly the three bitmaps just look a lot cleaner to
me than hiding a bit inside the version field.  There are a *few* people
using this, and so a complete switch in format for no actual net gain
seems wrong.  If we want to fake fE to the user as being one bit we can
do that through the setfcaps/getfcaps programs.
There also are prior examples of doing it this way (i.e. Olaf Dietsche's
implementation)
OTOH I don't deny implementing it fully as you describe seems to make
the intent of the code clearer to readers and maintainers.
I guess maybe I'll give it a go and see what turns out.
thanks,
