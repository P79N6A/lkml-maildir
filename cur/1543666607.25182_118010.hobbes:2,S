Doing! :)
I run a "custom" AIM7 workload on a uniprocessor K6/2.
2.5.64-mm8 finished it.  First 2.5 kernel going back
to 2.5.49 (at least) to complete that workload.
Similarly, the "shared" AIM7 workload wasn't finishing
on uniprocessor 2.5.x.  2.5.64-mm8 completed it too.
Petr Vandrovec has matroxfb patches for the new fb.
Are we getting close to 2.6-pre? :)
