?? It's not denial Richard.  I showed you your script running here and
working just fine.  As to your system running fine for two years, all
I can say is that _every_ system runs fine until it doesn't any more.
There may be a problem elsewhere, but the ramdisk does not display
the symptom you claimed it would.

Well it certainly does create a lost+found here as you can see.  It
sounds as though you're implying that I dummied up the script output.

I know what kernel messages are.  There are none.
