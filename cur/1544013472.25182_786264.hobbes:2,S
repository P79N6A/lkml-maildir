Ok, pulled and pushed out.
Has anybody looked at what the stack size is with MAXSMP set with an 
allyesconfig? And what areas are still problematic, if any? Are we going 
to have some code-paths that still essentially have 1kB+ of stack space 
just because they haven't been converted and still have the cpu mask on 
stack?
