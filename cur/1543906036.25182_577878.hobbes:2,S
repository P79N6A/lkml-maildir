does kgdb actually have a chance to get merged ?  with the history of
it, i just assumed it was never going in, so we've been using our own
kgdb patch on Blackfin ... so the version *we have* works great :) but
if there's a chance of this actually going mainline, we can see about
testing that version as well ...
