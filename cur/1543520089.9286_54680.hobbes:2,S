Hello,
to save a bit of disk space, I deleted all my old versions of gcc, found
under /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin (I had 2.7.2.3 and 2.8.1). 
Now gcc is under /usr/local/gcc-2.95.2/bin/gcc, and a kernel build failed
(2.2.14pre16) because of arch/i386/Makefile, rule found at line 68 :
arch/i386/vmlinux.lds: arch/i386/vmlinux.lds.S FORCE
	gcc -E -C -P -I$(HPATH) -imacros $(HPATH)/asm-i386/page_offset.h 
-Ui386 arch/i386/vmlinux.lds.S >arch/i386/vmlinux.lds
At the beginning of the file, there is a variable CPP constructed with the
current version of $(CC) and -E, so this should read
	$(CPP) -C -P ...
Greetings
Pascal Dupuis
