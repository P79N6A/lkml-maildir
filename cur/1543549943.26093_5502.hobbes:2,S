Hello,
So I tried your suggestions.  Unmasking the hd IRQs sure helps prevent a
lot of buffer overruns.  There still are some, but they're down by a
factor of 100 or more...  Any suggestions to reduce those even further
more than welcome, as I suppose this might cause some Multicast UDP
packets to get dropped.  :-/  Would using SCSI instead of IDE help, do you
think ?
 The 2.2.17 driver still seems to have a few bugs though: we get messages
like: "Too much work in interrupt, status e401".  This seems to happen
more on machines with RX buffer overruns.

I like to believe that people in the long run are going to do more to promote
peace than our governments.  Indeed, I think that people want peace so much
that one of these days governments had better get out of the way and let them
have it.
