Which RAID patch are you using against 2.2.17 exactly? Also make sure you're
using exactly the same kernel configuration of 2.2.17-RAID.

Might be possible, I've not tested RAID5 as root (though I tested raid5 in
non-root mountpoints). OTOH you said it mounted things correctly and it somehow
booted, so I'm not sure what's going wrong... Just make sure it's really a
kernel issue ;).
