Subject: [PATCH] 2.2.4 ptrace capability check incorrect, fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

2.2.4 still has the ptrace capability check wrong.
Observed:
# bash -c 'sleep 10 & execcap = strace -p $!'
_exit(0)                                = ?
Expected:
# bash -c 'sleep 10 & execcap = strace -p $!'
attach: ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, ...): Operation not permitted
