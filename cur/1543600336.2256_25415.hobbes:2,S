[ I'm leaving for a week in Europe tomorrow afternoon, so it's
  best to defer directly sent patches and commentary until next
  Thursday when I return. ]
Obtain it from:
ftp.kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/people/davem/PCI64/pci64-2.4.10p4-1.patch.gz
New in this release:
1) Alpha patch garbled in previous release (me)
2) Alpha build fixes and cleanups (Richard Henderson)
3) Merge to 2.4.10-pre4 (me)
It would be nice if someone would do the bits for ia64 and other ports
while I am away.  ia64 in particular should require a very small
amount of work.
Jens should be making new highmem-nobounce patches based upon this
soon.
Later,
David S. Miller
