You can, and people have had swapping long before virtual memory. Most
ucLinux platforms can't swap because they can't dynamically relocate code.
Linux 8086 can swap because it can use CS/DS updates to relocate code/data.
The way it worked on older systems is that you never run a program which
isnt entirely in memory. With that constraint you know it won't suddenely
want data you don't have
