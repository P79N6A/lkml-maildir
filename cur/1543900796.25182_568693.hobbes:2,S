Whereever people learn about "-DDEBUG", they should probably
be able to learn about "-DVERBOSE_DEBUG".  Which is likely
from existing kernel code (although most C coders will expect
that "-DDEBUG" does *something* interesting).
I suspect maybe Documentation/CodingStyle would be better..

====	CUT HERE
Update CodingStyle to talk about "-DDEBUG" message conventions and the
new "-DVERBOSE_DEBUG" convention.
