Subject: Problem in usb_driver_release_interface ( drivers/usb/core/usb,c ) in 2.6.X kernel

Hello,
with recent linux kernels ( 2.6.X ), the user-space driver of the
speedtouch usb modem don't work, after some experimentations I was able
to find a solution :
If I comment the call to the function:
usb_set_interface(interface_to_usbdev(iface),
			iface->altsetting[0].desc.bInterfaceNumber,
			0);
in usb_driver_release_interface (drivers/usb/core/usb,c)
( as it was in kernel before 2.6.0-test2-bk2 )
then the modem work fine, without any problem.
Can a Linux kernel developer explain this and try fix this in the
official kernel?
Thanks,
Laurent Desmecht
