Subject: [0/6] SPARSEMEM memory model patches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

After long testing outside -mm we believe that the SPARSEMEM patches
are ready for wider testing, please consider for -mm.
SPARSEMEM essentially is a replacement for DISCONTIGMEM providing
support for non-contigious memory but with the advantage of
handling both inter- and intra-node memory holes.  The goal of the
implementation was to design a clean memory memory model covering
the needs of both UMA and NUMA discontigouos memory layouts whilst
providing a basis for hotplug.  This should allow us to consolidate
the implementation of various "discontiguous" memory model whilst
trying to fix its short comings.  Ultimatly it should allow us to
remove DISCONTIGMEM.
Following this mail are 6 patches which provide SPARSEMEM for i386,
they introduce SPARSEMEM as an alternative to DISCONTIGMEM without
removing it:
[1/6] generify early_pfn_to_nid
[2/6] generify memory present
[3/6] sparsemem memory model
[4/6] sparsemem memory model for i386
[5/6] sparsemem swiss cheese numa layouts
[6/6] sparsemem hotplug base
These patches have been compiled, booted and tested on 2.6.12-rc2
(plus the -mm patches listed below).  They have been compile and boot
tested against 2.6.12-rc3-mm2.  They do assume a number of patches
already incorporated into -mm including the latest configuration
updates from Dave Hansen <haveblue@us.ibm.com>.
