Yes, sure - mistyped - it is about 300 nanoseconds (280-290 or so).

I would try it today - but it is a bit late in Moscow already - and
there are some things to complete yet. So, tomorrow I will create a patch
and run it, but I seriously doubt that there is _that_ high per-recvfrom 
latency.

Depending on how frequent is 'quite often' - if it ever changes the
distribution picture, then there is some problem.
