I guess in this model you can do all your development with quilt,
and the value of git is a high-bandwidth bransport medium to
replace e-mail.

Maybe true in your neck of the woods, but not true here.
I have more than a dozen topic branches in my tree, and they mature
at different rates.
When a topic branch is in the test tree and and a follow-up patch
is needed, I check out that topic branch and put the patch
exactly in non-linear 3D history where it is meant to live.
When the topic seems fully baked, I can pull the top of the
branch into the release tree.
