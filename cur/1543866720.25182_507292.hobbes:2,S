    I think you need to submit your patch to Andrew Morton since it requires a 
patch from his tree.

    It haven't really changed in the last patch. :-)

    It's for lost interrupts, IIUC. They use anothe timeout handler for the 
workaround...

    Yeah, IRQ0 is treated as no IRQ by 8250, and in this case it falls back to 
using serial8250_timeout() to handle "interrupts".

    Only the attachments will work in the Mozilla kind mailer, AFAIK.
The last patch looked OK at last. :-)
