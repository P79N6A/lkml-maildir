If not a partition table, then some positive indication that there is nothing 
more.

Because changing hardware is often quite annoying, and proprietary, and hard 
or impossible to script. I had one RAID that could only be set up by changing 
things using four buttons on the front panel.
But more importantly, I want controllers that survive total power down. No 
battery backed RAM, not for the setup. The cache can and should be, but the 
set up needs to survive user stupidity as well as hardware defects. And flash 
RAM still has a limited number of cycles, and can sometimes have *very* 
limited cycles, despite the best efforts of the manufacturer.

Restoring a 4TiB RAID is not what I want to be doing with a department of idle 
developers, especially if the problem is strictly with the controller. I want 
the controller to be able to get it's information from the disks. That way I 
plug in the new controller, and it says "Ready to go."

It was an aside.
Another factor is usage. I've had users who were assigned a slice of a RAID 
who asked me to divide the slice up, so that one experiment couldn't hose 
another by filling the whole logical disk.

Admittedly. But it's important to indicate the lack of a partition table, so 
the software can get on with life, rather than trying to determine if the 
partition table got scribbled on.

Again, searching a huge RAID to determine the old partition is not something I 
want to spend an afternoon doing, not when I can spend a few blocks out of 
millions and have backups.
