Your way of merging looks rather wrong.  Please submit changes against the
current swsusp code that introduce one feature after another to bring it
at the level you want.  You'll surely have to rewrok it a lot until all
reviewers are happy.
And most importantly for each patch explain exactly what feature it
implements and why, etc..  "swsusp2" tells exactly nothing about the
changed you do.
