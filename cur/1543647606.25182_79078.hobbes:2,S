Attatched is what I use when it all goes to hell in a handbasket. 
Works for me ... I'd love to see it more generally available, so
we didn't get bug reports saying "it says 'booting linux', then
nothing". I'm not desperately attatched to any one implementation,
as long as it works from really, really early on. The fact that
everyone and his dog (including me once, badly) has reimplemented 
this suggests it's very useful, and should go into mainline.
Patch by Bill Irwin and Keith Mannthey. Inlined so you can read it,
attached as well, cause my mail-reader on this PC seems to be eating 
things at the moment for some reason. This version supports standard
PC VGA consoles, and serial consoles (essential for remote work),
but should be easy to hook in other interfaces.
Probably needs some cleanup. If people would take a cleaned up version, 
I'll clean it up, or get someone to do it ;-)
