 OK, just my set of goals/requirements for a usable/production kernel:
- working VM under a broad set of loads. Working means fair/fitting
treatment of cache vs. process memory, no OOM killing processes when
there is plenty memory in "free+buffer+cache", no unnecessary swapping
out of processes if there is plenty of "free+buffer+cache" memory.
- good/great interactive feel. This means no loss of interactivity due
to cache vs. process memory issues. This means no loss of interactivity
due to heavy IO.
- Good enough worst case latency for "amateur" audio/DVD playback.
 What *I* do not need it "hard real-time" with 101% guaranteed response
times.
 What *I* want is to see my goals in the stock kernel, without needing
to apply a weird set of patches :-)
 How we get there I do not care to much. If -aa can solve the VM
problems, fine. If rmap solves them, great. Just bring a working,
maintainable solution in.
 Ditto for LL vs. preempt.
Martin
