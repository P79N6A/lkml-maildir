so, both have to go in 2.6/3.0. i hope, they do. it is clear, relying to jens, cd-mrw
is going to be in the future "stable"  kernel, so the question it on pkt-writing...
this code is more than 2 years old (i suppose). so it would be a gain, to include 
it within the official kernel. that would also be a point to the desktop-linux users
to use linux. (that ones dosen't use linux, until it supports things naturely (aka 
in mainline), 'cause they don't believe, it would be stable, until it is in mainline)
