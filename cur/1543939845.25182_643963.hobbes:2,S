Very nice patchset; small, simple, and clean.  Apart from the comments I 
already posted, I'd like to avoid the term 'hap': I find it 
non-descriptive, and it reminds me of another hypervisor.  I suggest 
'tlp' for two-level paging.
Since it re-uses non-npt real-mode paging, live migration and swapping 
will likely work without further changes.
