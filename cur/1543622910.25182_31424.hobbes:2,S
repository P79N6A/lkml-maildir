The way I deal with this is to ahve the following in my apm events script:
case "$1" in
resume)
	esdctl off
	rmmod cs4281 ; 	insmod cs4281
	rmmod cs46xx ; 	insmod cs46xx
	/etc/init.d/aumix start
	esdctl on
esac
The reason for the cs4281 and cs46xx is so that the script will work
both on my X20 as well as my T21.
It's a gross kludge, but it works....
