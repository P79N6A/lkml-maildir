-mm has a debugging patch which warns when atomic_dec_and_test() takes an
atomic_t negative
(
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.20/2.6.20-mm2/broken-out/detect-atomic-counter-underflows.patch
).
When it is applied to current mainline, a simple `rmmod ipw2200' gives:
[   75.825072] BUG: atomic counter underflow at:

This didn't happen in 2.6.20-mm2, so this bug was introduced by a patch
which was not in the -mm lineup twelve days ago.
Presumably the effect of this is a memory leak or a use-after-free.
