Maybe I take you by the word. I have a parport ditto 400 and an iomega
whatever
eating dust in the corner, so... be aware ;-). Yes they are alredy versy
shacky
but one could try. But better not.

I have a FlyVideoII, which accepts sound mute with the separate driver
but doesn't so with the 2.3.21 incorporate driver. However at a first
glance
the structure of the bttv driver appears to be a bit complicated.
Any doc's? Please don't Tell me about the IOCTRL please, this one can
easly
read up from the source of the using programms. But about: What are
the fields in the structs, what's the I2C interface and such. Just a few
random
comment notes in the code itself... would be greatly appreciated!
