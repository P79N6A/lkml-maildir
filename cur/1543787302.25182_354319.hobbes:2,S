Maybe I still misunderstand your idea.
The guarantee assigned to CPUSET 1a might not be satisfied if 
tasks are attached to CPUSET 2a only and no tasks are attached to
CPUSET 1a nor CPUSET 2b.  Does your idea leave as it is because
the user sets up CPUSETs like that?
Leaving that situation as it is seems enough feasible as one option.
Another option is to prohibit CPUSET 2a/2b from having smaller portions
of CPUs that is assigned to CPUSET 1a.

I was going to modify cpuset_cpus_allowed(CPUSET 2a/2b) as returning 
cpumask of CPUSET 1a, if tasks in CPUSET 2a and CPUSET 2b have the 
cpumask of CPUSET 1a.
BTW, thank you for fixing the [PATCH] mail that I had sent in wrong format.
