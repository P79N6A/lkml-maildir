it would be nice if the datastructure was "pure"; eg entirely owned by
the source (and could be made const), however the only way I can see
that done is by having a private duplicate datastructure in each clock
driver... which is way overkill for one single function pointer ;(
well you could do
struct clock_event_device 
{
	const struct clock_ops *ops;
	void *instance;
	evthndlr_t *evthandler;
}
that way if you have, say, 3 hpet channels you can use the same
"ops" (or maybe "props") structure for all three, but still register the
per channel state as well..
you maybe also want to have a "costs" member, so that you can pick the
cheapest available timer..

is pt_regs really really needed here? We got rid of it in most places
(and made it a per tast struct thing), I wonder if it can be made to go
away here too.

isn't caps a bitfield ? if so, shouldn't this be a & ?

hmmm so if I set a timer 10 nsec in the future, and then I get an
interrupt, I suddenly get an infinite time timer? Sounds more like a
case of "please just run it right away"

what is this watchdog touching for?

don't you want to start the per cpu timer in such a case?
