I have the same problem, kinda sorta.  Closing the lid causes it to go to 
sleep in the context that a vetrinarian uses.  ("It was put to sleep.")
Wakeup just spins the drive. And spins. And spins. And spins.
The machine is also a 64bit.  HP zv5200z AMD64 3700+.
According to a friend, 32bit suspend works in 32 bit but not 64bit.
