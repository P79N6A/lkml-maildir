I'm not sure I understand your concern with noop.  even if there were
writes in the queue (he said there were none/few) i don't see how read
starvation could occur with a FIFO.  also, I have read that for large
flash devices, there is a (small) seek penalty, but that it's
relatively constant for large vs. small seeks.  can someone elaborate
on that?
so dave, try deadline vs noop and let us know what you get.  also, are
you concerned with CPU use?
