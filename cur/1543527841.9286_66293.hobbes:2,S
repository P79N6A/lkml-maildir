Subject: Copy of dma buffer to user space

I'w writing a device driver for an I/O card that is able to read data and
transfer them thru DMA;
My probleme is that with 'acceptable' dma buffers (16k), I happen to get
several end_of_dma_transfer interrupts before the read() function, which
should copy data from kernel buffers to user space, gets awakened.
SO I tried to put my copy to user space in a 'bottom half' function, but
of course this won't work since when this runs the current process is not
always the one that is reading on my device...
Is there a way of :
-force the read() function (i.e my process) to be awakened just after my
interrupt ?
-or write to user space of a process other than 'current' ?
(I'm using Linux 2.2.13)
