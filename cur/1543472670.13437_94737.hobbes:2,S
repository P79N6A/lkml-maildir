IMHO this is a crappy reasoning. GPL is not to be exchanged.

No. GPL is the way we protect our software and it is not to be changed ...
for nothing. If IBM think that GPL don't suit their needs, simply
they don't use GPL'd software. I don't want to write software under an IBM
license.

No. _I_ will feel exploited if a version of linux kernel will be put on a
different license that GPL. The problem here is that if you change license
and give IBM the way of have an IBM/Linux kernel, I can predict that soon
we will have two different kernel trees: GNU/Linux and IBM/Linux.
No thanks. If they want to protect their patents, they have to deal with
GPL in some way, nothing more and nothing less.
And about IBM releasing sources of their commercial software in exchange, 
I am not convinced that this will be a great deal.
PS: and I don't think Linux kernel is going to change its license only to
    suit IBM needs. This will become a precedent that hardly Linux
    developers will want to establish. And then what ? M$ asks us to give
    them Linux sources under a modified license ? How can you deny this ?
    For IBM you've done it and for M$ no ? Are you trying to boicott M$
    market ? Do you want to have something to do with M$ lawyers ? (M$ is
    only an example here of course ... it can well be any big company out
    there)
Ciao,
