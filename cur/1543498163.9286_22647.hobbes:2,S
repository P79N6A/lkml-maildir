There was an earlier thread that touched on Apache optimizations but was
inconclusive on one point.  Is it or is it not possible to get around
the thundering herd problem with multiple NIC's and Apache?  Isn't that
Apache's main problem in this benchmark?
Apache is as much of an OSS poster child as Linux is.  Using something
else like Zeus might win the battle but would lose the war.  What is
really frustrating here is that while the netbench results have some
reasonable real world interpretation, the webbench results are truly
meaningless in today's world.  It almost seems like a diversionary
tactic to take people's time away from making apache better, by forcing
them to work on getting better numbers in a meaningless test.  Does
anyone know of a Quad Xeon server anywhere with 4 100mb/s NIC's being
pounded by 250+ clients throwing everything they've got at it?
