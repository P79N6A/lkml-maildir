:-), Okay, we could make grub read /etc/fstab... But again user can do
swapoff and swapon manually etc.

Having sto stop userspace processes and bring hardware back to some
sane state would complicate swsusp (and its testing!) a lot. Maybe in
2.8 when it works perfectly in other cases....

I'd attribute it to buggy module.  If you can reproduce it you can try
to fix it....
....but swsusp with modular kernels... I'm not sure if it can even
work. .. yes it can but you really should get it working monolithic, first.
