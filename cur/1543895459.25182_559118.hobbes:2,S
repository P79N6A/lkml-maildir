Yes - and in others you must meet certain approvals.

Then providing the modification was not utterly trivial, or the user was
warned, or it would have been obvious to the person making the mods that
it was a bad idea whoever made the mods will get pasted

Unlikely. Even in the stupidly litigious world of "Warning: Kitchen knife
is sharp" if you modify something you usually get the blame - some
exceptions being those where the mod is obvious, trivial and apparently
safe.
(oh and for the UK and I guess much of the rest of the EU if you fiddle
with a safety check and remove it and someone gets hurt you can face
criminal charges up to and including manslaughter)
