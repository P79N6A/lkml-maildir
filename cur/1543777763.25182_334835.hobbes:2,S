Exactly!  I've written a logging device to record data in the kernel
that a printk can't help with.  I've used this in debugging inturrupts,
the scheduler, and high speed network packets. Where a printk to a
serial would just slow things down, and going to the network is too
expensive, and complex if you happen to be debugging the network. This
tool is called logdev (
http://www.kihontech.com/logdev
) and uses a ring
buffer that is like the relayfs overwrite mode. It can do printk like
records and when something goes wrong, I dump the buffer to the serial.
Or I have a user space program reading it from a device. I don't care
about anything that happened earlier, I want to only know what happened
up to the point I dumped the buffer.  Lately, I've been usuing this with
Ingo's RT patch, and when the system locks up, I dump the buffer, and it
shows quite nicely where the lockup occurred, and why.
With Tom's help, I also have a version that uses relayfs as a backend in
overwrite mode.  It's still a work in progress (so no web site yet!)
since there's some issues of using a singe buffer for multiple CPUs.
This helps in debugging race conditions since you need to see how events
interleave.

The reason I would like to see this merged, so kernel hackers don't need
to constantly write there own logging buffers everytime you need to
debug a complex area of the kernel.
