It just mean that your stdin was closed some time in the past...
As the prog is a daemon, probably it closed its std{in,out,err} and its
controlling tty.
I do not know if Linux follows the rule that the first fd you get is the
first available. That means that after 'daemonize' you should get the 0
in the first connection. If fd reuse is delayed, you can get the 0 any time
after...
