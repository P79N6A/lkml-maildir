This isn't SCO code. This goes back to SCO's claims of "control rights"
over any source code that has been in the same room as UNIX code.
These "control rights" depend on SCOs interpretation of what a 
derivative work is. This is a contractual dispute, an attempt of SCO to
reframe what a derivative work is and a big up hill battle for SCO as
virtually all the parties of original contracts have in their
declarations not supported SCO claims of "control rights".
Stephen D. Vuksanovich, Scott Nelson, Richard A. McDonough III, Robert
C. Swanson, Ira Kistenberg, David Frasure, and Geoffrey D. Green.
Four of them are (or were at relevant time periods) AT&T employees.

Besides the declarations, there is other items that don't back SCO
"control rights" claims such as the $echo newletter, and amendment X to
the contract.
