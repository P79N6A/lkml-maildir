Something that's been bothering me for a while, has been the
proliferation of 'driver' type things appearing in arch/i386/kernel/
My initial thought was to move the various CPU related 'drivers'
(msr,cpuid,bluesmoke,microcode) to arch/i386/cpu/  [1]
but I'm now wondering if an arch/i386/driver/ would be a better alternative.
Opinions?

[1] also a more natural home for things like cpufreq if/when it gets integrated.
