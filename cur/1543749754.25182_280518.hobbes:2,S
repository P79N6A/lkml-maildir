I can apply the LVM2 patches from 
http://sources.redhat.com/dm/patches.html
 to the
2.4.28 kernel (it mentions things are off a bit).
I can also build device-mapper, but not using
./configure --with-kernel-dir
instead, I use
./configure
Is there anything else I should do? Has anyone else made it work? It seems like it
should work, but I don't want to switch over directly, if possible.
