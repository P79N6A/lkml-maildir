FPGA device, number of buffers for DMA transfers. 1000 buffers should be 
enough, but you'll never know what $user will do with his bigmem machine. 
They will be able to resize anyway. If I don't get it done with 'n' it will 
be an ioctl. For the moment it fails anyway since sysfs_get_dentry() got 
removed.
This resizing stuff is purely optional. A 'n' giving me the number of entries 
would at least help coding since you can easily find out how much space you 
need for reading everything in the directory. Giving a dynamic n this is 
racy, but that's another story.
