Since i'm using kenrel 2.2.5 a few days, i have major problems with
kernel smbfs. I'm using smbmount from samba 2.0.3. I made sure
that i removed all older versions of smbmount.  But smbmount
doesn't seem to do any problems, mounting the shares works fine.
The remote machine is a windows nt server 4.0 / SP4.
When mounting shares, i can access them without problems, but
after some time ( not more than 5 or 10 minutes) i can't access
the shares anymore. Any access try results in a "i/o errror".
I know of no way to recover this situation. When trying to
smbumount/umount it, it get the same "i/o error". I have to su
to root and use umount to get rid ot the broken mount points.
As long as i used 2.0.36 in our hereogenous evironment i never
experienced such problems.
Below is a log which holds the error messages i got since my first
"i/o error" while accessing the shares. If someone needs more info
about the environment where i have this problem, just tell me what
you need.
thanks in advice,
	Markus
ps: as i mentioned, shares disappeared after a few minutes.
    i did some weird testing after writing the body of this mail:
    i mounted two smb shares from our nt server, /smbmnt1 and 
    /smbmnt2 . i changed to /smbmnt1 and executed the following
    command 'until false; do date; ls; sleep 3; done >~/smbcheck &'
    after a while ( one houer) i checked back and :
    /smbmnt1 was accessable without any errors
    /smbmnt2 had the same "i/o error" as mentioned in the mail
    body above.
    weird fix, isn't it ? any ideas whats wrong ?
    Is it normal to have a process
/smbmount //computer/share$ XXXXXXXXX -c 'mount /smbmnt1' -U user
    in 'pause' state floating around ? This is only true for the
    smbshare which did NOT disappeared after a few minutes.
    is there a relationship betweens the smbmount process
    floating around and the accessability to the shares ?
pss: i double checked also our network cables and links, there is
     no problem with them
