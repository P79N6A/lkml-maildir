That puzzles me.  I'm not sure how my patch could affect
IRQ handling.  Could you please try the version of the
patch that I submitted last night under the title
"[PATCH] PnP BIOS -- new"?  Let me know whether you do
or you do not get the error messages concerning multiple
reservations of IRQ9.

I wouldn't hope too strongly that my patch will help you.
Just to be clear.  IIUC you are saying that my patch isn't
the cause of your problem; it's just that it doesn't solve
your problem.  Is that right?
