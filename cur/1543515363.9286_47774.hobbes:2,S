	You need to carefully manage the lifetimes of shared objects, which you are
not doing. Do not 'close' a socket while another thread may still be using
it. If the socket is a TCP connection, you can shutdown the socket (with
'shutdown') to stop any I/O on it and ensure that other threads get errors
when they try to use it. Then as sure as you know no thread could still be
using the socket, you can 'close' it.
	But calling 'close' on a socket that is in use by another thread risks many
race conditions. Don't ever do it.
	Think of 'socket' like 'malloc' and 'close' like 'free'. Would you 'free'
an object while another thread was trying to use it?
