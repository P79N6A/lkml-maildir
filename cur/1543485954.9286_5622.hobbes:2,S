[psst, next time send a subject.. linux-kernel gets several hundred
messages a day :)]
First off, the Linux kernel can be obtained at one of the many mirrors
around the world by looking at 
http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/.
 Of
course, in order to test anything you will need a copy of linux
(www.redhat.com, www.debian.org, www.caldera.com, www.slackware.com,
etc). You can take an existing Linux device driver (linux/drivers/*) and
see how it's done, it's fairly straight forward.
If you are not the hack and slash type of programmer, there are a few
books available on the Linux kernel worth mentioning, Linux Device
Drivers has very good reviews ISBN: 1565922921.
Online documentation including howtos, whitepapers, drafts, specs,
notes, dooddles, etc can be found at 
http://www.linux.org/help/.
And of course, if you really need help with a specific area, in the
linux kernel there is a MAINTAINERs file containing the mailing list of
every single peice of the kernel. Or you can just bug Linus and Alan,
they love email.. don't you guys? :)
