It looks like that recent "mimimal IDE changes" in 2.2.11 kernel
got me into trouble with ATAPI CD (SAMSUNG SC-140B) on Alpha dp264.
The last kernel which booted on this machine is 2.2.10-ac10.
When I am trying 2.2.11 (and 2.2.11-ac3) I see "hda: lost interrupt"
followed by some timeouts and
"irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }".
After that I am flooded with:
"dp264_device_interrupt: NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!!"
scrolling fast on my screen and I can only hit a reset switch.
There are some other error messages, including a dump of a timed
out CD command, but they are hard to catch as they are immediately
erased by these "NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!!".
I tried various options and ended up, eventually, with:
"hda=cdrom hdb=noprobe ide1=noprobe" but this did not change anything.
I have another Alpha machine with ATAPI CD which boots fine both
with 2.2.11 and 2.2.11-ac3 but this is a different platform (EB64+)
and a different CD (NEC CD-ROM DRIVE:284).  Regrettably this dp264
is now at the other end of this city and I will have an access to
it, for a short while, only Monday. Sigh!
