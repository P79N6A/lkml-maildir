I think it's fine as an option, but taking it out of config and making it
an immutable part of the kernel is probably undesirable. It appears to be
a small gain (nothing I can easily measure), and a larger risk. I'd like
that to be an optional risk, like many other things in the kernel,
available to be used if the last drop of size or performance is desired.
Does someone has any numbers showing what this gains? I didn't see
anything obvious when I tried it, so it's either very small or only in
some case(s) I didn't try.
