Please verify that reverting this patch actually fixed your problem.
$subject talks about 8139cp, but you list a change to 8139too, which are 
two different drivers.
It's often wrong to focus on the driver.  If a driver suddenly stops 
working, that may indicate a problem in the interrupt subsystem, etc.
