Well the first thing needed is an mincore that actually works for anonymous
memory!
I've implemented some fixups in that department, which should get merged
into 2.6.21. That reminds me: I'll send the patch to linux-mm for review...
We cannot get real atomic snapshots in general, but I don't think that would
be a problem if you are just doing some profiling.
