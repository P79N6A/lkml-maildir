Right, but this is why the kiobuf IO functions are supposed to accept
kiovecs (ie. counted vectors of kiobuf *s, just like ll_rw_block
receives buffer_heads).
The kiobuf is supposed to be a unit of memory, not of IO.  You can map
several different kiobufs from different sources and send them all
together to brw_kiovec() as a single IO.
Cheers,
 Stephen
