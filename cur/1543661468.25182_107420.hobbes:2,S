I can't offer any immediate help with this but I want the same thing.  At
some point, we're planning on funding some extensions into GCC or whatever
reasonable C compiler is around:
    - associative arrays as a builtin type
      {
      	  assoc	bar = {};	// anonymous, no file backing
	  bar{"some key"} = "some value";
	  if (defined(bar{"some other value"})) ...
      }
    - regular expressions
      {
      	  char	*foo = "blech";
	  if (foo =~ /regex are nice/) {
	  	printf("Well isn't that special?\n");
	  }
      }
    - tk bindings built in
and then we'll port BK to that compiler.  It's likely to be GCC because we
want to support all the different architectures but if a kernel sponsered
cc shows up we'll happily throw money at that.
