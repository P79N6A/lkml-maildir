Because its' _very_ expensive on certain machines.  You have to do
1 or more I/O accesses to get at the PTEs.
If you add this reverse notion to just one API (the dma pool one) then
people will complain (rightly) that there is not orthogonality in the
API since the other mapping functions do not provide it.
No, it is unacceptable.
