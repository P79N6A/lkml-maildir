Until these numbers do not exceed total amount of RAM, this is exactly
the action required in this case.
Dumps, which you sent to me, show nothing pathological. Actually,
they are made in some period of full peace: only 47 orphans and
only about 10MB of accounted memory.

This is not essential with 2.4. In 2.4 this state does not grab any essential
resources.

Why?

If you still have problems with orphans, you should raise these
numbers. Extremal settings are sort of:
Z=<total amount of ram in pages>
Y=<something < Z>
Z=<something < Y>
echo "$X $Y $Z" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem
Set them to maximum and if the messages will not disappear completely,
decrease them to more tough limits.

Normal. Debugging.

Debugging too.

Number Z is exceeded, newly _closed_ sockets will be aborted and
stack entered state of moderation of its appetite.
Dump, which you have sent to me and further messages in logs,
show that it succeded and converged to normal state.

Actually, the only dubious place in your original report was something
about behaviour of ssh. ssh surely cannot be affected by this effect.
Could you elaborate this? What kind of problem exactly? Maybe, some
tcpdump is the problem is reproducable.
