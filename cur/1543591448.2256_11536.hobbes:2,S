I could see that.  In some cases (ISA devices in particular), they'd probably
be blank all of the time, and would be taken out of the equation.

Since topology-cookie would be opaque, it doesn't matter what bus its sitting
on....its either the same or its different.  As long as "pci bus 0, slot 1"
turns into the same cookie each time, and is always different than the 
"isa io=330" cookie then no problem.

Not necessarily, from other posts, serial number may or may not be unique.
All of the fields would probably be interpreted at the same time, but keeping
them separate would handle 'odd' cases that we've not thought of at this point.

Hmm.  True.  However, most of the other fields (Vendor/model, topology) would
be available before the driver is loaded.  Shouldn't that be enough to figure
which driver to use?  Of course, ISA devices cause problems here...come to
think of it, ISA devices cause problems no matter what we do :)
