dev_printk expects a struct device, not a net_device.

this lets us pass in the return value of netdev_priv() directly
without having to have the cast in the code that uses the macro.

For each multicast group, we want to export the GID, how long it's
been around, whether our join has completed and whether it's
send-only.  It wouldn't be too bad to create a kobject with all those
attributes but getting the info from so many little files is a little
bit of a pain, and so is dealing with kobject lifetime rules.  It's
even worse with netlink since then a new tool is required.  (AFAIK
relayfs isn't in Linus's kernel).
It's nice to be able to tell someone to just mount ipoib_debugfs and
send the contents of debugfs/ib0_mcg.
The actual filesystem stuff is pretty trivial using everything libfs
provides for us now...
    Greg> Why not just use 2 different debug variables for this?
No real reason... I'll fix it up.

Good point, I'll move it into ipoib_multicast.c.
