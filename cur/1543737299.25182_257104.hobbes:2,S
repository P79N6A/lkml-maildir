I don't understand. The highmem issue was when resuming, not when
suspending ? My laptop doesn't suspend with -rc3. Please elaborate ?
What config do i change ? Remember i don't have ACPI, so unless pmdisk
supports APM BIOS poweroff, then -rc3 is useless to me.
Thanks

Actually problem turned out to be in highmem. Unless you
are using highmem, -rc3 should work. You'll need to change config if
switching from pmdisk to swsusp...
