Whoops.  That wasn't intentional ...

I have a (temporary) #define for FE_(UN)REGISTER in there to relax the
dependencies between cx88 + dvb core a bit.  That way it is only a
runtime dependency and only for the dvb part of the cx88 driver.
Unfortunaly the #define catched only one of the two cases where it is
needed, and I didn't notice the second one as I'm working with a
dvb-patched kernel to actually test the stuff ...
Whats your planned timeframe for submitting the dvb updates?  I'd love
to see a working cx88 dvb driver in 2.6.9.
