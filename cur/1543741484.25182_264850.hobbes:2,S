Ok this is probably a very stupid proposal, but since I just 
woke up I feel like saying stupid things, and plus I'm happy 
with my 512 extra RAM, so here goes:
have you considered some kind of "open source obsolete 
versions" procedure à la Aladdin? They develop GhostScript, and 
have some sort of "dual licence" strategy: the latest version 
follows the AFPL licence, and older versions are released under 
GPL.
