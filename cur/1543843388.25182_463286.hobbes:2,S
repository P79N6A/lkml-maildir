Tracepoints of course need to be managed, but that's true for both dynamic 
and static tracepoints. Both have their advantages and disadvantages and 
just hammering on the possible problems of static ones (which are not much 
of a problem for other people) is highly unfair and not a reason for 
rejection. If you don't like them, don't use them, nobody forces you, it's 
that simple...

kprobes are not trivial to implement (especially to reach the level of 
perfomance and flexibility of static tracepoints) and until then you deny 
their users/developers a useful tool? 
I also think you highly exaggerate the maintaince overhead of static 
tracepoints, once added they hardly need any maintainance, most of the 
time you can just ignore them. Only if the code drastically changes they 
need to be adjusted, but at that point this should be the smallest 
problem. The kernel is full debug prints, do you seriously suggest to 
throw them out because of their "high maintainance"?
bye, Roman
