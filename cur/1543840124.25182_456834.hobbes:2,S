That looks like the classic SCSI bad-sectory non-recovery bug.
The code in scsi_lib.c, scsi_error.c, and sd.c is currently a
bit of a mess here.  
Basically, given an I/O request for 200 sectors, with a bad sector
in the middle at number 100, what SCSI will often do is fail sectors
number 1 through 100, one at a time, retrying the entire remainder of
the request after each attempt.  This takes hours, and results in no
data for the first 99 good sectors.
What it needs to do *instead*, is retry each sector individually,
rather than the entire request.  This would result in sectors 1..99
and 101..200 succeeding, and retries/failure only for sector 100.
A slight optimization would be to fail the bio size around sector 100,
rather than just the one sector.
I've got patches that do exactly this, and they work quite well.
But they're probably not "pretty enough" for inclusion.
Cheers
