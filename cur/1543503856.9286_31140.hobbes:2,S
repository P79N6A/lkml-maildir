You're searching for the silver bullet which doesn't exist.  I know of
some Omirr like ha-system in a German bank.  A pair of machines for
reasons of availability even distributed over a city each had mirrored
disks, running OpenVMS.  The data corruption caused by a not correctly
plugged in SCSI cable resulted in both mirror sets being corrupted and
the corrupted data also being mirrored over to the other system.
Knock out.
