Subject: [2.2.12:pciide] cdroms the last 2048 bytes missing

cp /dev/hdc cdrom.raw worked well for me.
this morning i saw, pciide was not enabled,
so i build a new kernel with it :
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD is not set
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y
now the last 2048 bytes of the cdrom are missing. 
i don´t know if this has an impact on useing the cdrom,
but it gives a different md5 checksum

(burning debian 2.1r3 cd´s, and reading and md5sum´ing them for correctness).
