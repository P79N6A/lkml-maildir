Correction: make that two outright bugs.  I have just been told that
one of the dubious bits of code is broken.
Tracking the interaction of multiple locks to ensure that they
correctly prevent a race on incrementing the use count is too messy and
fragile.  The offending bits of code were not written by beginners but
by experienced kernel programmers.  If experienced programmers get it
wrong, then the method is wrong.
