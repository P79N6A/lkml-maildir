Subject: 2.4.10-ac4 (SMP, highmem) complete freeze

The same story as with 2.4.10, only faster:
After one day of uptime under load 2-3 (highmem),
the box froze completely. Only hard reboot (actually power unplug)
brought it back. Nothing in logs, nothing over netconsole-C2 ...
Hardware:
dual Xeon 550Mhz, C440GX+, 2GB RAM, 1GB swap, SCSI AIC-7896/7
