What use cases do you have for that?

Why? It is a special case, in that in a lot of machines there's only
going to be the root cgroup, and the subsystem won't be mounted. So in
those cases, paying any overhead is a cost without a benefit.
Alternatively, how about you skip tracking virtual address space
changes if the virtual address cgroup isn't mounted on any hierarchy?
When you mount it, you can do a pass across all mms and set the root
cgroup usage to their total.
