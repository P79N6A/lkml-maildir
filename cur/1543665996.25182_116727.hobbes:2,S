I only did one run, but yep, it's pretty close on my box too.

A value of 5 doesn't seem to be enough.  I fixed irman's parse problem so 
it can run the memory test properly and ran it with pipe_circle_tax set to 
5, 25 and 50.  The results are attached along with results from 
2.5.64.virgin and 2.5.64.bk5 for comparison.
There isn't any detectable change wrt the window wiggle test... still 
pretty choppy.
