Please, if it is possible, make it simple and sensible.
if to have true multihead, with 5 keyboards and mice, I would really wish
that the device numbers are connected to physical holes for plugs,
otherwise anyone (of schoolchildren for example) can do simple nasty
stupid things.
And also it is the dream for true dumbuser with one mouse, because it then
just works out of box.
Or you tell that with USB internal design you can not know physical
connector unique number ?
