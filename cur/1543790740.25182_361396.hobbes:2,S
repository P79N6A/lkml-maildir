Hi!
> This is the main part.  It introduces a new data structure for the
> swap-handling part of swsusp (the swap map structure, described in a comment)
> and new functions for writing the image data to and reading them from swap.
> It also introduces the interface functions allowing the snapshot-handling part
> to communicate with the swap-handling part and modifies the struct pbe
> structure (the swap_address member of it is no longer needed as the
> swap-handling part uses its own independent data structures).
One small comment. I miss "a" in "swap". Pretty please...

Feel free to add yourself to CREDITS, too. CREDITS are going to stay,
but this does not really belong here, and may have to be moved
somewhere else in future.

Nice...

Please don't. Just use "struct swap_map_page" instead.

Make it "extern unsigned int". (That is in more than one place).

Please, usefull words, that's receive_init and image_pages....
Otherwise it looks good. I'll check it once more...
