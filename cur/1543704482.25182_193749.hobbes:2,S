Thanks - I wasn't sure about it.
The kernel now builds. However, after doing
	echo disk > /sys/power/state
or "hda14" or "/dev/hda14" (which is my swap partition) instead of "disk", 
nothing happens (and nothing gets logged). 
The only things different from your patch is that I added PMAC_MB_CAN_SLEEP 
to my iBook's entry in pmac_feature.c, and added 
	return -EBUSY; 
after your 
        if (state != 2 && state != 3)
                return 0;
in radeon_pm.c (to avoid pmud putting the iBook to sleep by mistake).
relevant .config part:
# CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND is not set
CONFIG_PM_DISK=y
CONFIG_PM_DISK_PARTITION="/dev/hda14"
Any pointer ? (did I miss something obvious?)
Thanks,
