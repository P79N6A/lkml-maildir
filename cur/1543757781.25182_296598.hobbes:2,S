You mean uncached?
For userspace it's used by some of the MPI type apps in userland.
Presumably there's cases where it gives better performance. For the
SN2 hardware there's also a special mode known as fetchop mode which
requires uncached memory, it's used quite heavily by the same types of
apps.
The problem is if you then have apps such as lcrash which may read
through all kernel memory. If a page is mapped uncached to userland
you can hit the memory corruption case if you access the same page
cached from within a kernel cached mapping. I suspect the suspend code
could hit similar problems, but I don't know that code well enough to
say if it's the case or not.
Cheers,
Jes
