sure there is one who will help
in freebsd when a socket is created,
the process  structure of the process creating socket
is passed as an argument to socreate function.
is there any mechanism in linux kernel where we can
associate the process creating socket with the socket.
or we can fetch the process structure of the owning
process given the socket or sock data structure.
