Yes...the only concern I would have is that if you downsize the tag map,
you don't seem to keep any memory of what the high water mark actually
is.  Thus, I can drop the depth by 8 and then increase it again by 4 and
you won't see that the increase can be accommodated by the already
allocated space.
