sg3_utils is a package of command line utilities for sending
SCSI commands to devices. This package targets the lk 2.6 and
lk 2.4 series. In the lk 2.6 series these utilities (except
sgp_dd) can be used with any devices that support the SG_IO
ioctl.
This version adds sg_format which can format SCSI disks,
potentially with a different number of bytes in each block.
It can also resize (sometimes called "short stroke") a
disk. There are also extensions to the sg_dd utility to
use the READ LONG SCSI command on damaged blocks (for a "last
resort" media copy).
A tarball, rpm and deb can be found on:
http://www.torque.net/sg
 .
