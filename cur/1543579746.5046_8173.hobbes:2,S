Hrm, it should only turn on that particular multicast address, not go PROMISC.
I will look at that.
The change-MAC DOES turn on PROMISC, because that is the only way I could
figure out how to make sure that the underlying device passed the packets
up to the VLAN layer.  The idea is that if you are using VLANs, you are
probably using an ethernet switch, so there shouldn't be TOO much traffic
on your port that isn't destined for you...so being PROMISC shouldn't
hurt too bad.

I think the advanced routing protocols (OSPF??) use multicast in their routing
decisions/management.
