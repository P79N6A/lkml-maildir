For the present thread, this is irrelevant, as the irreverent responses 
hinted at:
Regardless of _any_ features or fixes in V4, reiserfs V3 will be used in 
production system for years.  Minor feature additions to an existing 
filesystem make it far easier for kernel engineers and sysadmins to 
assess the impact on their systems -- which is typically of less impact 
than switching to a new filesystem.
