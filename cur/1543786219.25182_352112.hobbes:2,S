Okay here are some cases to help you get a better idea,
p1: watch /tmp/foo
p2: rm /tmp/foo
p1 gets IN_DELETE_SELF
p1: watch /tmp/foo
p2: echo > /tmp/foo
p1 gets IN_OPEN
p1 gets IN_MODIFY
p1 gets IN_CLOSE_WRITE
p1: watch /tmp
p2: rm /tmp/foo
p1 gets IN_DELETE + "foo"
p1: watch /tmp/foo
p2: unmount /tmp/
p1 gets IN_UNMOUNT
p1 gets IN_IGNORE
p1: watch /tmp/foo
p2 cat /tmp/foo
p1 gets IN_OPEN
p1 gets IN_ACCESS
p1 gets IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE
p1: watch /tmp/foo
p2: mv /tmp/foo /tmp/bar
p1 gets IN_MOVED_FROM + "foo" & IN_MOVED_TO + "bar"
p1: watch /tmp/
p2: echo > /tmp/bar
p1 gets IN_CREATE + "bar"
p1 gets IN_OPEN + "bar"
p1 gets IN_MODIFY + "bar"
p1 gets IN_CLOSE_WRITE + "bar"
