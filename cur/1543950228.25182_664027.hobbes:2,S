Not nightmare. OMAP1/2 have mmc/sd/sdio controller supporting one or
more mmc cards sharing the same bus.

Not true. I can't show you not even parts of the technical documentation
but OMAP has mmc/sd/sdio controller. On OMAP1/2 it handles several mmc
cards sharing the same bus.
And that's what mmc multislot is doing. Probably it still needs some
tweks though. But that's up to Carlos.
