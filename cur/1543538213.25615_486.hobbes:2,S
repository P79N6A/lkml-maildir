Hi,
   Whoops, looks like I only sent my note about comparisions between
vesafb and rivafb 0.72 to Jeff Garzik.  Anyways, to quickly sum up what I am
seeing, here's the output from fbset -i under rivafb 0.72 and vesafb, both
running at 1024x768-16:
rivafb 0.72:

Notice how the rgba lines are different between the two.  Vesafb appears
with correct colors, and rivafb does not.  I guess I'll have to study the
2 drivers and see if I see some obvious error somewhere.
