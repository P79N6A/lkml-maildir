Really?
So what you are trying to do is 'application may never read bad
sequence of bits from disk', right?
Now, how do you propose to solve mmap(MAP_SHARED)? The app on the other cpu may
see the bad bits before kernel has chance to see them.

Andi's solution seems the only one that has chance to work _reliably_.
