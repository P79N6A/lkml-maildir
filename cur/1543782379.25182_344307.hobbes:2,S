Not quite. The issue that I'm trying to describe is that if, we
inconsistently calculate time intervals in gettimeofday and the timer
interrupt, we have the possibility for time inconsistencies.
The trivial example using the current code would be something like:
Again with my 2 cyc per tick clock, HZ=1000.
gettimeofday():
	xtime + offset_ns
timer_interrupt:
	xtime += tick_length + ntp_adj
	offset_ns = 0
0:  gettimeofday:  0 + 0 = 0 ns
1:  gettimeofday:  0 + 500k ns = 500k ns
2:  gettimeofday:  0 + 1M ns = 1M ns
2:  timer_interrupt:  
2:  gettimeofday:  1M ns + 0 ns = 1M ns
3:  gettimeofday:  1M ns + 500k ns = 1.5M ns
4:  gettimeofday:  1M ns + 1M ns = 2 ns
4:  timer_interrupt (using -500ppm adjustment)
4:  gettimeofday:  1,999,500 ns + 0 ns = 1,999,500 ns

Well, in many arches gettimeofday() works around the above issue by
capping the offset_ns value as such:
gettimeofday:
	xtime + min(offset_ns, tick_len + ntp_adj)
The problem with this is that when we have lost or late ticks, or if we
are using dynamic ticks you have granularity problems.
