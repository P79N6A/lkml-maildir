You are right, but only in the part where you say that this
is the best, indeed the only, way you can work.
Alan is right, information is important, and a lot of it is
submitted only once. (And a lot of it is submitted three times
and ignored three times.)
Suppose you find a gcc bug, construct a small example that
is mistranslated and send it off to the gcc list. Maybe even
include a fix. Will you babysit them, check whether later snapshots
correct this flaw, resubmit your report every month if not?
Maybe you will. I certainly don't - send the report and that's it.
