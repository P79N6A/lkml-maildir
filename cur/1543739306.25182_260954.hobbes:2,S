At least for the 2.4 kernels it is not possible to run code from user 
space early enough in the boot sequence to bring up the video card when 
the framebuffer console driver starts. Alan Cox said there is work under 
way for 2.6 that might allow this, but it would have to be done very 
early in the boot sequence.
Remember this project is for non-x86 platforms such as PowerPC and MIPS 
embedded machines where there is no way to set a graphics mode using the 
BIOS before the kernel starts loading (well, you can do something using U-
Boot but a lot of projects don't always use U-Boot).

Yes, I am aware of this project. It is a great project for x86 platforms, 
but falls short for non-x86 due to the inability to set a basic display 
mode prior to user space access becoming available.

I am not familiar with that. Can you point me to a URL?

Yep.
