The NFS client neither knows nor cares what is going on down in the
ethernet layer. As far as it is concerned, you might as well be using
semaphore to pass messages between the computers.
All the NFS client needs to know is that it should retry the socket
sendmsg() operation when a certain (user defined) timeout value is
reached.
