That sounds very right aside from the global reserve. A given subsystem 
may exist in multiple instances and serve sub partitions of the system.
F.e. there may be a network card on node 5 and a job running on nodes 3-7
and another netwwork card on node 15 with the corresponding nodes 13-17 
doing I/O through it.
