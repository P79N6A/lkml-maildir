There's a surprisingly simple solution solving the problems you describe:
For userspace libraries, the common approach is to get them stripped and
have versions with all debugging symbols in some -dbg package. So if you 
want to debug an application using such a library, you simply install 
this -dbg package.
Just let distributions make the same for the kernel - add a -dbg flavour 
with many debugging options enabled. It might perhaps run 5% or 20% 
slower than the regular kernel, but you don't need profiling or powertop 
during normal operation - these are _debug_ tools.
This way, there's no runtime penalty and therefore no trickery
required for getting the overhead of _debug code_ lower.
