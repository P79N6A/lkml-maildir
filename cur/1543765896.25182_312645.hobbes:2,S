That is the idea, though I think that we need to be able to
provide users the option of not doing a load balance within a
sched domain

That is the current definition of cpu_exclusive on cpusets.
I initially thought of attaching exclusive cpusets to sched domains,
but that would not work because of this reason

I agree

Since isolated cpusets are trying to partition the system, this
can be restricted to only the first level of cpusets. Keeping in mind
that we have a flat sched domain heirarchy, I think probably this
would simplify the update_sched_domains function quite a bit.
Also I think we can add further restrictions in terms not being able
to change (add/remove) cpus within a isolated cpuset. Instead one would
have to tear down an existing cpuset and make a new one with the
required configuration. that would simplify things even further

And maybe also have a flag that says whether to have load balancing
in this domain or not
