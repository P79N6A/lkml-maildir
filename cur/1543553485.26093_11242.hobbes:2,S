Yes indeed, I suggested the ':=' when kwhich first went in, for this
reason.  I suspect my mail was either ignored or overlooked.
That whole raft of variables uses '=' instead of ':=' and I've
occasionally wondered if this was intentional.  Possibly so, because
arch/{mips,m68k}/Makefile both set CROSS_COMPILE, which wouldn't work
if the toplevel used ':='.
I don't like it, though.  I think the user should be assumed to either
have a standard toolchain installed, in which case gcc and binutils
should be in the path under standard names --- or the user should know
enough to specify ARCH= and CROSS_COMPILE= on the compile line.
Alan: to avoid the 'CROSS_COMPILE defined too early' problem in the
stable series, I suggest the following, which will at least prevent the
kwhich script from being execed 200 times as reported.
