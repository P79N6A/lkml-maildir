For Christmas I got my hands on a Yamaha CRW6416S (SCSI-2 CD-RW) and 
Toshiba XM-6401TA (SCSI-2 CD-ROM) drives. They're running off an Advansys 
UltraWide SCSI controller (940UW).
When I boot Linux, my machine hangs after detecting the CD-RW drive. As far 
as I can tell, termination is ok... The SCSI chain is
ID 0 - CD-ROM (terminated, end of cable)
ID 3 - CD-RW (not teminated)
ID 4 - SCSI controller (set to active termination)
ID 5 - HP ScanJet (terminated)
Am I missing something here? The kernel is 2.2.14pre16 compiled with 
support for the Advansys controller plus SCSI disk and CD support and the 
option to support proprietary extensions for Toshiba drives. The rest of 
the system is Debian 2.2. I've had no previous 2.2.14pre problems.
