 okay.
 you will be pleased to know that the switch-off-irqs-in-the-isr
 and then switch-it-back-on-in-the-FIQ approach works.
 *gibber*
 basically i am doing this:
 * in the ARM interrupt read routine, first thing i do is mask
   read interrupts.
 * i then set up the ARM port for "read", including disabling the
   keyboard which shares some of the port lines.
 * i then read the byte (which causes an edge-triggered interrupt
   to the PIC, which then sets about clearing the interrupt).
 * i then re-enable the keyboard.
 * at the end of the routine, i then set a flag.
 some time later, within 1/8000th of a second, this flag is checked.
 if it's set, read interrupts are unmasked.
 ... btw when you say "using the linux interrupt management" routines,
 what exactly do you mean?
 at the moment (because that's what was done when i stepped in
 to sort out this code) i am directly accessing the INTMR1 and
 INTSR1 registers - _not_ calling enable_irq() or disable_irq()
 or other)
 (and in the FIQ handler of course i _can't_ call those functions).
 is that a problem?
