This special case in interesting: sendmail runs as long there is no new
connection (no need to swap in the needed text), then forks for the new
mail, and the child dies more or less silently. The machine sending the
mail even gets a 'Message accepted for delivery') I set the core dump
size to 0 on the mail machine, btw (small disk ~80MB)
