Not gzip, no. It needs to be a random-access compression with reasonably
small blocks, not something designed for streaming. Which makes it harder
to do right and efficiently.
But ARM has Thumb (not the same thing, but same idea), and at least some 
PPC chips have a page-based compressor - IBM calls it "CodePack" in case 
you want to google for it.
