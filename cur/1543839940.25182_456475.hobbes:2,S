Ah, klibc defines _REGPARM if required.

I didn't find a corresponding open bug in the gcc Bugzilla.
Can someone verify whether it's still present, and if yes, open a gcc 
bug?

It's set globally in arch/i386/Makefile:
  cflags-$(CONFIG_REGPARM) += -mregparm=3
That's not pulled by UML, but if there are no outstanding problems with 
regparm, we could both enable it uncomditionally on i386 and enable it
on UML/i386.
