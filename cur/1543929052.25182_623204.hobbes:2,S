Subject: [RFC] kobject_init changes - take 2

After Alan pointed out my stupidity, here are some new patches :)
They add three new functions:
	kobject_init_ng()
	kobject_add_ng()
	kobject_init_and_add()
The "_ng" portion will go away after all of the current kernel users of
kobject_init() and kobject_add() are converted over.
There's also a second patch that shows how they are used, and how this
actually saves code in the callers.
Any further objections about these changes?
thanks,
greg k-h
