Yes. It oops in fbcon_cfb8_putc. I haven't figured out yet what exactly
caused it. I don't have this card to play with :-( Did you run the other
test I suggested. Try booting at 640x480 with a color depth of 32. Then
try booting at a different resolution (1024x768) at the default color
depth. I want to see if its a error with the resolution setting or if it
is a error with setting up the data relating to the color depth handling. 
The results should give me some clue.
