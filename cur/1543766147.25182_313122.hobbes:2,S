Hi Andi,
PPC64 IA64 and S390 use variable size TASK_SIZE for 32 bit and 64 bit
program.
I feel it is hard to maintain if we try to audit TASK_SIZE use
everywhere, because most of them are in generic code.
And maintaining those audit code in separate place is also a problem.
E.g. in current 32 bit emulation code
TASK_SIZE is defined as 0xfffffff in elf loading, but defined as
0xffffe000 in mmaping.
How did that earlier patch break applications?
Thanks
Zou Nan hai
