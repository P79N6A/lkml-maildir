   I have a copy of the 2.6.X port. I tested it on my laptop at work but I 
get a funny matrix effect every 256 pixels on my display. It looks like 
that data from the early pixels is repeated even if it is distored. 
Basically what is in pixel 1 is displayed in pixel 256 but distorted and 
what is displayed in pixel 512 is what should be displayed at pixel 256 
but distorted. Also each distortion band is about 8 pixels wide.
   I wouldn't submit it tho until I can test the patch on a sparc64 
myself to make sure it works.
