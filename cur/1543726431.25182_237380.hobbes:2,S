I get a number of gripes from SMP aware folks that the context switching
overhead is significant as well as cache issues. That's what the concern
is about.

Yeah, this is an obvious next step in order to get better performance.
Do you have number showing how this logic effects overall SMP and interrupt
performance ?
I wish I could help with this, but I'm doing other things at the moment.
