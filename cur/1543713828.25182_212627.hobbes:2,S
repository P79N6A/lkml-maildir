If you want a block scrubber then write a block scrubber.
If you want to add O_DIRECT support to dd then it should be implemented
properly, and that means implementing it for both read and write.
In fact the user should be able to specify the read-O_DIRECT and the
write-O_DIRECT independently - if for no other reason than that the source
and dest filesytems may not both support O_DIRECT.
