Did you say "makedumpfile should get OSRELEASE from a vmlinux file,
and output it to a mkdfinfo file", right ?
If so, you are right. I'm creating the patch for it.
BTW, I'd like to remove PAGESIZE from a mkdfinfo file.
While 2nd-kernel is running, new makedumpfile comes to consider
2nd-kernel PAGESIZE as 1st-kernel PAGESIZE without getting PAGESIZE
from a mkdfinfo file.
In current implementation, makedumpfile considers 2nd-kernel PAGESIZE
as 1st-kernel PAGESIZE if a vmlinux file is specified instead of a
mkdfinfo file. On the other hand, makedumpfile can get 1st-kernel
PAGESIZE correctly if a mkdfinfo file is specified, because there
is the rule that a mkdfinfo file should be generated on 1st-kernel.
Now, I will change this rule for generating a mkdfinfo file on the
kernel-building environment. I feel considering 2nd-kernel PAGESIZE
as 1st-kernel PAGESIZE is better than considering the PAGESIZE of
kernel-building environment, because 1st-kernel and 2nd-kernel have
the same PAGESIZE in most cases such as relocatable kernel.
Please let me know your opinion.
Thanks
