So you want this info from userspace, not from within the kernel, right?

It seems a bit md specific to add a lot of kernel code for something
that can be solved with a userspace shell script :)
But if you want to try it, use a class, and a class_device for this, not
raw kobjects.  It should be a bit easier that way.
