Subject: [PATCH] Bluesmoke is now EDAC
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/17/89

I believe this sub-system was deliberately renamed from Bluesmoke to EDAC. In
that case, we should probably get rid of the remaining Bluesmoke references
and change them into EDAC.
This patch changes Bluesmoke into EDAC in Kconfig and Makefile and I also took
the liberty of rewriting some of the help text slightly.
