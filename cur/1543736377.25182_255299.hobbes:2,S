that's it yes.
I don't even think "save their key securely" (I mean saving anything
related to the swapsuspend encryption key on disk) is needed. A mixture
of a on-disk key + passphrase would not be more secure than a simple
"passphrase" alone, because the on-disk key would be in cleartext and
readable from the attacker. the only usable key is the one in the user memory,
it cannot be saved in the computer anywhere. Peraphs for additional
security (and to avoid having to type and remember it) one could use an
usb pen to store and fetch the key... but then I leave the fun to the
usb folks since to do that usb should kick off before resume overwrites
the kernel image ;)
