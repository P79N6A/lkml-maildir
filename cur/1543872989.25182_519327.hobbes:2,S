Did you see any performance improvement?  We used to have quicklists
on ppc, but I remain to be convinced that they actually help.
Also, I didn't understand why we have to do quicklists to take
advantage of the fact that the pages are in a pristine state when they
are freed.  I thought the whole point of the slab allocator was to be
able to take advantage of that...
