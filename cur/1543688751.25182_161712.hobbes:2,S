Hello!
Kernel 2.4.22 does not power of my HP omnibook 4150B (APM Bios 3.13)
(
http://h20004.www2.hp.com/soar_rnotes/bsdmatrix/matrix31635en_US.html#BIOS
).
With Kernel 2.6.0-test4-mm4 it works, but there suspend to disk does not
work any more.
I tried with CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF and without. The machine
does not power off. It just stops after saying "Power off". When I press
ctrl-alt-del afterwards, the kernel crashes in both cases.
Is there a patch for 2.4.22 around?
Regards, claas
