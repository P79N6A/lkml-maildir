Subject: [PATCH] zone table removal miss merge
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

As suspected this is not related to SPARSEMEM configuration at all.
But relates to the case where the node,zone size is zero.  Here we
then are trying to shift (sizeof(int) - 0) which is illegal.
We should be defining ZONEID_SHIFT in terms of ZONE_PGSHIFT not
ZONE_PGOFF.  As this was correct in the orginal patch I assume this
was somehow damaged during merge.
The below should fix it.

zone table removal miss-merge
It looks very much like zone table removal v2 suffered during merge
into -mm.  This patch is needed to get rid of the following errors
on arm (and I suspect other platforms):
  include/linux/mm.h: In function `page_zone_id':
  include/linux/mm.h:450: warning: right shift count >= width of type
