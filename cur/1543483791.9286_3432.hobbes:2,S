I got these error messages in /var/log/messages today:
Feb  2 11:13:21 mail1 kernel: scsi0: MEDIUM ERROR on channel 0, id 4, lun 0, CDB: Read (10) 00 00 2b 5a 1c 00 00 80 00

Feb  2 11:13:21 mail1 kernel: scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:12, sector 588360
Device 8:12 seems to be /dev/sda12, but I don't have such a partition!
