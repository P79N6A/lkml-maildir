They are not ignored. They are saved as TCP soft error and delivered on a timeout.
Spoofing TCP is generally a bad idea. When someone tries to spoof or is 
misconfigured to accidentially spoof he can surely eat a timeout. It is not
a common case.
But in this case it does not matter anyways: Unless you turn on that 
spoofing filter during active connections (unlikely), it will always see the 
initial connection establishment. In this case ICMPs are reported after
30-60s.
