(Lost respondent's email address - silly me - I should not use computers
after a massive munting session!)
Thanks for getting in touch with me regarding development of framebuffer
devices. I've now updated the Framebuffer-HOWTO with the new URL and as
soon as I've brought it up to date with new developments in 2.3.x I shall
push it out to the LDP and up on my website.
An announcement will follow soon. 
I'd like to hear from framebuffer authors about new changes for 2.3.x
framebuffer drivers.
Cheers, 
Alex
