I agree.  The problem AFAIR is that the i_blocks accounting is done in
the quota code, so it was a challenge to get it right, and the i_size
limit was easier to do.  Until now I don't think anyone has created
dense 2TB files, so the sparse limit was enough.
Fixing this to count i_blocks correctly would also allow us to have
larger sparse files (up to the indirect limit).
Note also that there was a patch to extend i_blocks floating around
(pretty small hack to use one of the reserved fields), and it might make
sense to get this into the kernel before we actually need it.

So, for the quick fix we could reduce this by the number of expected
[td]indirect blocks and submit that to 2.4 also.
Cheers, Andreas
