What do you meen with buffer overrun at the stack? 
The structures I send are 2644 and 1084 bytes, so this is not too big I think.
Is this definition of the argument correct when I use a pointer of the 
struct TKip5KernelPacket,
#define KIP5_IOCPLOT _IOWR( KIP5_IOC_MAGIC, 21, sizeof( TKip5KernelPacket ) )
or must it be 
#define KIP5_IOCPLOT _IOWR( KIP5_IOC_MAGIC, 21, sizeof( TKip5KernelPacket *) )
???
