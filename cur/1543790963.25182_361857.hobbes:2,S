Good. This raises the general problem of devices knowing about their
underlying media status.

Mount needs some fixing :-) It just tries calling sys_mount and
retries ro if that fails, then returns success because the last call
worked ok. Or so it would seem from the strace output.

Yes. Right now, I think the gendisk policy is the best place to store
this - but having some generic "check the media status" VFS callback
might be a good thing.

I'll check, but they probably do something like this in their implementation.

There's a callback for remount requests, perhaps they use that. Bear
in mind that USB devices tend to be more communicative than ancient
floppy disk drives. I'll have a look into this though - anyone else
reading who thinks we need a generic way of checking media read/write
status in addition to media change detect?
Jon.
