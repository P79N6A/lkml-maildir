This could be a problem with DNS. Could you do all tests
(including pinging) with -n option?
I've read your other message on netdev and see you
have firewall working and addresses from various 
networks in logs. I think it would be much easier
to exclude possible network config errors and try
to isolate pinging problems by connecting (with
switch or even crossed cable if possible) only 2
boxes with firewalls and other net devices disabled
and try to repeat this pinging with tcpdumps.
