I agree debugfs or relayfs would be better suited. Of course as the
driver matures this form of debug is probably not required at all.

I count 88 TODOs in the driver, it would be nice to get rid of some of
them like the two above, so we can concentrate on the important TODOs :)

No need for kernel version ifdefs.
