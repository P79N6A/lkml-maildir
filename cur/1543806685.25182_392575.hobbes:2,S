Umm.
Wouldn't it be _much_ better to declare the argument as a "long", since 
some architectures (alpha, for example) may assume that 32-bit arguments 
have been _sign_extended, not zero-extended.
Then, when the "compat_sys_xxxx()" function passes the "long" down to the 
_real_ function (which takes an "int"), those architectures (and only 
those architectures) that actually have assumptions about high bits will 
have the compiler automatically do the right zero- or sign-extensions at 
that call-site.
