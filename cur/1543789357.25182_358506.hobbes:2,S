Hi,
Looks like fs/ntfs/namei.c is missing linux/compat.h
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  CHK     usr/initramfs_list
  CC [M]  fs/ntfs/namei.o
In file included from include/linux/dcache.h:6,
                 from fs/ntfs/namei.c:23:
include/asm/atomic.h:383: error: syntax error before '*' token

make[2]: *** [fs/ntfs/namei.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [fs/ntfs] Error 2
make: *** [fs] Error 2
Compiles fine with #include <linux/compat.h> added to the top of
fs/ntfs/namei.c
If that's the right place for it, of course.
