Timeouts are nasty to debug.  It can be caused by whole range of
different problems including transmission errors, bad power, faulty
drive, mishandled media error, IRQ misrouting, dumb hardware bug.  It's
basically 'uh... I told the controller to do something but it never
called me back'.
If you see timeouts on multiple devices connected to different
controllers, the chance is that you have problem somewhere else.  The
most likely culprit is bad power.  Please...
* Post the result of 'lspci -nn' and kernel log including full boot log
and error messages.
* Try to isolate the problem.  ie. Does removing several number of
drives fix the problem?  If the problem is localized to certain device,
what happens if you move it?  Does the problem follow the drive or stay
with the port?  If the failing drives are SATA, it's a good idea to
power some of the failing drives with a separate PSU and see whether
anything is different.
By trying to isolate the hardware problem, more can be learned about the
error condition and even when the problem actually isn't hardware
problem, it gives us much deeper insight of the problem and clues
regarding where to look.
Thanks.
