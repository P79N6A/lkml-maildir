Thanks to those that have responded !
I thought I would summarise this as it's quite simple and there was no
disagreement in the replies.
Please excuse any 'oddness' in the format, I am stuck using Lotus Notes

Many SMP boxes report both CPU's when only one is present. It isnt a big
problem.

On SMP capable CPU's - no. The single CPU kernel is more efficient however
(typically 5% faster)

it's a bus terminator.  its improves the signal properties of the bus
when there's no processor there to load it properly.

there is none.  it'll be very slightly slower, possibly unmeasurable
outside of a benchmark.

That´s a bus-terminator, it belongs where it is! ;) It helps to keep the
second
slot from acting as an antenna ;)

no, it´s just a little slower i guess. the smp-kernel has a little more
overhead
but it´ll work ok in my opinion.

sure. normally nobody would want to do this ...

In this case i´d recommend installing a single cpu kernel!

There have been buggy kernels where this won't work, but if it works, fine.
There's a small (<1%) speed penalty in the kernel. Since most programs
spend
very little time in the kernel, it's really not noticeable.
