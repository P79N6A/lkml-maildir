The de facto standard for network devices is to use sockets.
For character and and block devices Unix/Linux uses the
open/poll/ioctl/read mechanisms.
Some Linux drivers use the /proc file-system for 'information'.
You could send your module a pid via proc and have it send a
signal to your application as a result of an event.
