It's a new OSS Sound Blaster driver from Paul Laufer along with the new
PnP changes from Adam Belay.
Things are looking better but we still have serious conflicts. I don't
know why i'm out of IRQs so quickly.
The counter is at zero because it was a fresh remote reboot. If i was to
use the soundblaster I would get IRQ/DMA timeout errors. I do hear chunks
of sound though so we've got a conflict of sharing IRQs somewhere.
