Fairness is a pretty basic property though, and should not be dropped 
lightly.
Even on the desktop, unfairness could be explicitly wrong for a small number
of users, while also opening you up to "implicit" corner cases.
As far as interactivity goes maybe it can be disregarded on servers, 
maybe it
can't. What about multi user servers? Does it only apply to X interactivity?
Then how about multi user desktops? Maybe not a big deal.
Fairness should be fundamental though (IMO).
