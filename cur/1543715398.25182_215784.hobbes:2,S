Huh? /proc/$PID/cmdline doesn't exist until after a task is
created. What you did was create a task, change whatever
is in proc, then exec (which doesn't change the PID).
How would you expect fork() to know that you wanted to
do this? The permissions in /proc are file permissions.
They have nothing to do with a task.
Also, any task can read its own command-line without using
/proc at all.
