Glargh, lemme take that back :-p
Wait, it takes in an const char ** argument, and then the whole error
return checking is based on the (const char *) *arg, and not the
return value (-EINVAL, -ERANGE) itself. And it appears, we set the
const char **errstr from inside the function only if the caller didn't
explicitly give us a NULL itself ... hmm, it all does make sense, plus
allows to convert negative inputs as well -- now that the error return
checking in the callsite won't be based on the return value anyway
(but strtonum(3) is still a bit daft, in that it "pretends" to return
error values in ret even though the caller can't use that to test if
an error actually occurred).
[ Thankfully there won't be any BSD lovers around here, so probably I'll
  be able to get out of this clean :-) So okay, I'll port it over ... ]
Thanks,
Satyam
