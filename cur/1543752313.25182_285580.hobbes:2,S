That is what I had in mind for the longer term. Now that I think about
it, my current patch is probably a bad way to get from here to there --
it adds a config option that would later *need* to be renamed and moved
to a different category.
(To be specific, the concept I have in mind is to have an option that
disables the syscalls that are usually used only by libc5 and earlier.)

I don't see how it would be zillions, but it's possible there's
something I'm not yet understanding.

And if you have programs that need it, you (or your vendor) can set the
config option accordingly.
