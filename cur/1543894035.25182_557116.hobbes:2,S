Interesting. Our requirement comes from Japan as well.

Some kind of id is always required to be able to identify the message.
The task is to make the tagging as simple as possible.

There I have my doubts if this can work. If you keep an external
database with the additional information about the messages the kernel
code and the database will get out of sync. Thats why we advocate the
kernel-doc style approach: the message catalogue will always be in sync
because it is delivered with the kernel.

This is a paint point with Michaels approach as well. The KMSG_COMPONENT
defines are rather ugly. A clever way how to generate kernel unique IDs
would be nice. Intervention required..

With the KMSG approach all that needs to be done is to replace the
KERN_xxx with KMSG_xxx(<number) and to add a comment at the end of the
file.

Very interesting. We did not know about this project. Thanks for the
hint.
