And what should be directed into stdin? Nothing. There should be no
input going into an automated build, exactly because it could produce
incorrect results.
BTW, this is the automatic build that Debian and Ubuntu both use (in
Debian's case, used for quite a number of years). So this isn't
something I whipped up.
Still, the build system shouldn't have to do anything special with stdin
to get the desired result. The code should also not react differently
based on stdin being closed, or being pumped with nul data.
