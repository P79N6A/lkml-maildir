nope, that doesnt work, because the function call is a one-time thing 
via the early_console_initialized flag. Nor does this keep compatibility 
with the 2.6.18 API, my existing boot-entries:
        root (hd0,4)
        kernel /boot/bzImage-x64 root=/dev/hda5 \
	earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,115200,keep console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty
stopped working.
I agree that the parameter parsing here is a bit hacky, but my patch 
restores the original behavior, so i think that's the best option for 
now.
