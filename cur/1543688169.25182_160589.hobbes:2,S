thank you Andrew for diggin' that much into this issue. but as i said 
before i don't really need parport_pc that much right now.
well, i do need. but i (too) don't have much time this week for testing 
and replying any faster to this issue.
Thank you for the patch, but it'll have to wait until tomorrow :-(
good night,
Christian.
