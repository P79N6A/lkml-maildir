If all you care about is the UTF-16-compatible range, you only need
1088K entries in your table; small enough that it can be reasonably
had in userspace.

The thing is, you're probably only touching small parts of your table,
so the kernel and the CPU cache works quite well on the large table as
it is.
Wouldn't work in kernel space, though.
