Hmm, "would" doesn't sound like "it's working now" ... and the latest
available modutils for 2.5 (version 0.7) certainly does none of this.
One of the points being that the breakage comes from changing the
format supported by modutils.  Restoring current functionality should
IMO be high on the agenda .... USB has worked poorly in normal .configs
for a while now, because of this.
