The X scheduling code isn't really designed to handle software GL well;
the requests can be very expensive to execute, and yet are specified as
atomic operations (sigh).

Are you attempting to measure the visible updates by eye? Or are you
using some other metric?
In any case, attempting to measure anything using glxgears is a bad
idea; it's not representative of *any* real applications. And then using
software GL on top of that...
What was the question again?
