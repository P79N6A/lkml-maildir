It's silly your otimization. What do you think to gain? Show me the
numbers. IMHO you only add a very subdle complexity and dependences to
code that currently are completly orthogonal and you gain nothing. I
consider it a design bug. It's a no-way for me and it was obvious since
the first look at your patch.

The previous scenario was the same scenario but thought against my last
algorithm that I mistaken with the 2.3.x one. If you fall back on the idle
cpus only if avg_slice is relevant, then you don't need to take all CPU
busy with SCHED_OTHER tasks to make the same behaviour to happen.

That's why I was not worried. Anyway it _make_ differences.
