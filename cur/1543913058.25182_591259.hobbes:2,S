Right. Not nice.

A user space programm could map the config space (if MMCONFIG is usable)
and scan the PCI devices directly using memory access.
This patch sets pcidev->cfg_size to 4096 for certain devices so that
the ECS is also available using proc/sys fs or lspci -xxxx. In this
case the Kernel access functions are used. This works with both
methods, CF8 and MMCONFIG. For CF8, all patches of these series must
be used.
Note also, that ECS access is not only for CPU devices available, but
also of other PCI Express devices on the bus.
