   This isn't unique to PowerPC or ARM, and has nothing to do with allocating
   page tables.
   
Yes it is in fact unique to those ports...
   I don't understand how pci_alloc_consistent could ever be claimed to work
   from an interrupt function because it actually allocates pages of memory
   for all architectures.  Anytime you call alloc_pages() (or friends) you could
   potentially block or return an error (out of memory) condition.
   
If it specifies GFP_ATOMIC, there are no problems from interrupts.
You will see that every port other than the mentioned two above use
GFP_ATOMIC in their pci_alloc_consistent implementation, for this very
reason.
The ARM and PPC ports could set __GFP_HIGH in their page table
allocation calls when invoked via pci_alloc_consistent, and this is
the change I suggest they make.  It is a trivial fix whereas backing
out this ability to call pci_alloc_consistent from interrupts is not
a trivial change at all.
