Fernando,
Thanks for reporting this. Looks like we need to fix the ata driver:
2.6.26.8-rt13:
drivers/ata/libata-sff.c:
 ata_sff_hsm_move()
 calls ata_pio_sectors(), calls
   ata_pio_sector()
		/* FIXME: use a bounce buffer */
		local_irq_save(flags);
		buf = kmap_atomic(page, KM_IRQ0);
This code is in 2.6.24-rt but in libata-core.c
It is slightly different, prehaps you were just lucky?
