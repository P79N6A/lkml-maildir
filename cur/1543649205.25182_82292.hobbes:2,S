Sorry,  used the wrong dmesg file for the copy and paste of the error message.
yes the printk error message issued is:
scsi: Device offlined - not ready or command retry failed after error recovery:
host 0 channel 0 id 0 lun 0
over and over through all ids, existing or not.
Patch was successfully applied to 2.5.44.
