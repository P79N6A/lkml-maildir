Hmm, I don't know how current ncurses treat terminfo definition in UTF-8 
mode and what linux terminal definition you are using in you test 
system. There are different definitions floating around in different 
distributions which are slightly different especially as we talk about 
acsc chars and enacs, smacs and rmacs sequences. Which is also wrong 
approach so there should be one proper definition of the linux console. 
Maybe kernel developers should prepare some most compatible and 
acceptable one.
I can post the one I am using today:

If using this definition and my patch applied acsc mode is not working 
then there is something wrong in curses code IMHO.
I am using Ubuntu distro and with this patch and this definition
aptitude properly displays semigraphics in UTF-8 mode and Midnight
Commander also works almost correctly (almost because it is not properly
ported - it displays help using iso-8859-2 help file without conversion
to UTF-8 so I can see replacement glyphs as it should be but in options
and menu it uses UTF-8 but incorrectly counts bytes instedad of glyphs
so screen is not looking properly if there is a multibyte UTF-8 seqence
used in a line; anyway it's MC bad code not terminal fault).
