Yes, it's goal but since we are not there yet you should try to compile with
gcc 2.7.2.3 if you have troubles anyway. That is: 2.2.x SHOULD eventually work
with egcs 1.1.1 (and this of course could be achieved only if a lot of peoples
will try to use egcs 1.1.1 for kernel compilation :-) but just now there are
far not all glitches found so if you have problem you SHOULD try to compile with
2.7.2.3 and check is problem is still there. And in BOTH cases please report to
linux-kernel list.
