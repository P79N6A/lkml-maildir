No. Apart from semantics being different (which I'll address below), anybody
with any business looking at this code will immediately know and understand
what the latter line means. Not so for the former.

But VM_MIN_READAHEAD of course should be rounded up, for the same
reasons I said VM_MAX_READAHEAD should be rounded down.
So OK as a bug fix, but it needs to be in its own patch, not in a "common
macros" one, and sufficiently commented (and preferably outside your core
adaptive readahead code so it can be quickly merged up)
