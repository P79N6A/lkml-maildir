Yes, that would make sense.  It should be a filesystem hook, so that
even remote filesystems like SMB can implement it, although it must be
understood that remote notification has different ordering properties
than local.

The difference is that NFSv3 can return _stale_ data, while local
_cannot_.  I call stat(), and the information is up to date.
I don't care about the cache semantics at all; what I care about is
whether a returned stat() result may be stale.
Why?  This is the difference between "make" generating correct data,
and "make" generating incorrect data.[1]
The caching model isn't the issue.  That's the filesystem's problem.
I just want a way to get up to date data in my application.
My motivation isn't actually "make" although that's important;
generally, I need to know how to verify my in-application cache of a
file.  (Think fontconfig, ccache etc).  I use dnotify for similar
purposes, when it's local.  (dnotify is much faster than many stats
for a complex cache dependency).
Currently, I use statfs() and read /proc/mounts to determine whether
the filesystem is a known type or mounted on a block device, to decide
whether stat() and/or dnotify are reliable.  This is not ideal.  In
particular, I don't know of any way to _guarantee_ that I have the
latest file contents from remote filesystems short of F_SETLK, which
way too heavy.[2]

[1] I have built programs, including kernels, which crashed due to
timestamps not appearing on a different computer after changing code
so make didn't compile everything.
[2] I have lost code I was editing due to saving it and then a
different computer updating the file by reading a stale version,
modifying it and writing it.
