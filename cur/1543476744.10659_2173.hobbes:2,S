When trying to burn an audio CD I get weird hard drive error messages,
such as:
Jan 10 13:58:57 thwack kernel: hda: read_intr: status=0x59 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest Error }
Jan 10 13:58:57 thwack kernel: hda: read_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=3074912, sector=808928
Jan 10 13:58:57 thwack kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 03:04 (hda), sector 808928
this only happens when attempting to burn _audio_ CDs, i can burn ISO-9660 
data CDs fine.  i'm running Linux 2.2.0-pre6 and cdrecord-1.8a15, but i
have gotten the same errors in linux 2.1.131 and cdrecord-1.6.1.  i have
an ATAPI BTC CD-R drive and it has SCSI emulation enabled.  I have an
IDE hard drive with bus mastering enabled.  Any suggestions, notes, help,
etc. would be -GREATLY- appreciated. Thanks.
