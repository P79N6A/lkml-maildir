Subject: Kernel hard reboot in 2.0.36

I just purchased a new Abit BX6-2.0 motherboard, and a Celeron 300A as well as
64mb of PC100 SDRAM.  After installation of the goods (I upgraded from an Epox
P55-TV, Cyrix 6x86, and 80mb EDO) I rebooted into Linux and immediatley noticed
2.2.1-ac5 giving a protection error when it did a partition check.  Logically, I
thought that something in my kernel wasn't going to work w/ my new hardware,
therefore I downloaded the latest Debian rescue disk and went to work.
To make a long story short: my machine would reboot every time it started
services of some sort (most notable at the point where it does something with
the PCI bus and ISA pnp).  Seeing as this was a consistent lockup point, I
removed all but the most essential services (basically everything but the
swapping stuff and FSCK).  This made the system boot, however, it appears that
after a certain amount of time (no longer than 7 minutes) the box just reboots. 
It appears to be a hard reboot of some sort, but I can't pinpoint it because the
screen is just wisked away (no kernel logs, no panics on the screen, just a nice
reboot).  I have not been able to re-compile a kernel to see if I can fix it
since I reboot so quickly.
Does anyone know what I can do to fix this?  The machine runs stably for HOURS
in windows with no errors or reboots at all, and when I look at the temperatures
in the temperature utility the motherboard came with the temperatures are
perfectly acceptable within the case (about 95F).  I should note that this is a
Celeron 300A overclocked to 450mhz (100mhz FSB) running a core voltage of 2.2v. 
However, I know this is not the problem because I have run the hell out of it
(prime95, RC5-DES, photoshop gaussian blur on a 100mb file, mp3 streaming while
working, etc.) and it has never given me an error in Windows.
Does anyone know how I can fix this behavior?  I have noticed that the 2.0.36
boot disk will run fine forever it seems, but when I'm using the harddrives it
reboots (I mount the HD's when I just boot from the disk, and it seems fine). 
I've tried all of the kernels I have (2.0.36, 2.1.132, 2.2.1-ac5) and none of
them seem to be able to fix my problem.  ANY insight into this matter is GREATLY
apperciated, as I need my machine to make the presentation to the local LUG on
Wednesday night.
You can check out specs for the motherboard at www.abit-usa.com , I have the
BX6-2.0 model and I HAVE flashed up to the latest BIOS (Feb 1999).
