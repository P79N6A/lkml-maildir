The way I see it, it's: "if someone gets around to implement *IPv6 NAT*"
(which, if its designers were asked, is contrary to the idea of ipv6).

Absolutely...

Where's the hack? iptables operates on what it sees, and it sees br0.
The physdev match is justified IMO.

Whether a packet goes out a bridge (was that the intention of -j BRIDGE?)
is determined by the routing table, which, in most cases, is just a matter
of destination address.

I'd prefer if Linux outputted its packets by default :)

pkttables it is!
But this idea may have its benefit: by not restricting rules to certain
positions like currently, throughput could be achieved. "Evil packets"
f.e. could be dropped really early. (Well, you could also drop them early
_today_, but a DROP in the mangle table will everyone make their eyes roll
:-)
