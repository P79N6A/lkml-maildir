Yes. But my patch (backported from 2.4.x too) which is included into
2.2.17pre9 waits on dirty buffers.

IMO it is stability related.  
Think about a very dirty VM (e.g. mmap002). If you are into a
very-low-memory situation and you dont sync dirty buffers, propably
someone will get killed if the memory gets too low.
Now if you wait for some of those buffers to get synced, making them
freeable, you may avoid killing a process.
I agree with you that in the first place we should not allow the VM to get
completly dirty as in current kernels.
But since we can't fix that in 2.2 "correctly" anyway, we should at least,
under a low-memory situation, avoid killing processes because of a very
dirty VM.
