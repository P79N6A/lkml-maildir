Hey all !
I am a newbie ! Recently I read a to do related huge pages on
linux-mm.org the statement being :
"Fork of an application with huge pages when no huge pages are left -
must fail over to small pages."
- Firstly,according to COW whenever the write is occured then the copy
of huge pages will start
- Now if no huge page is left we need to go for 4Kb pages....But the
application requires the huge page !
- One solution for this might be to use bunch of 4Kb pages to satisfy
the requirement....Moreover there is no demand paging or swapping
concept for huge pages !
Will this topic be feasible to go forward to....?
