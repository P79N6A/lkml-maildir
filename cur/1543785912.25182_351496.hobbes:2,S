I have a 2GB dual opteron workstation running Ubuntu 5.04 with
2.6.11-1-amd64-k8-smp on MSI K8T Master2-FAR
I am experiencing kswapd using 98% of cpu.  My Googling implied that
this had been fixed in 2.6.11 - is there still a known problem?  I
wasn't very clear about this after searching the archives, and I'd be
grateful for information - I'm not an expert I'm afraid, and I'd like
to be sure it isn't a hardware problem. If there is a problem, is there
a workaround (e.g. a boot parameter that I might supply?) or is it OK
simply to allow the cpu usage to continue (temperatures are only a
couple of degrees higher).
I don't know if it's relevent but I notice that dmesg reports:-
Restarting tasks...<6> Strange, khubd not stopped
 Strange, kswapd0 not stopped
 Strange, kseriod not stopped
 done
Swap is not actually used:-
             total       used     free     shared    buffers
cached Mem:   2055816   438068    1617748   0
49528  164808
 -/+ buffers/cache:     223732    1832084
Swap:      2104464          0    2104464
I'd appreciate a Cc, as I'm not subscribed.
Thanks,
