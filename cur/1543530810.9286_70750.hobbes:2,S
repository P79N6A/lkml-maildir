Are you by any chance compiling on an smp machine, and have a modified
Makefile with the "make = make -j2" type line in it, or have you modified
the makefile in any way ?
I found that since i had modified the makefile to compile on my smp machine
faster, one of the bits of the patch failed when applying it.
i had to back out the patch, change the makefile back, then re-apply the
patch.
(I used the bzcat patchfilename | patch -R -p0 command to backout the patch)
Hope this helps...
