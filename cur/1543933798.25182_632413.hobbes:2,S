I did it but I think it's better to reuse a minor from ttyS than
allocating a new major (64 serial ports is a lot). I saw that other
drivers take a similar approach, just tend to stay away from low
numbers that are used by 8250 and its child (that can be connected
more or less everywhere).  Perhaps in these udev times the serial
minor number should be allocated dinamicaly. Do you think this makes
sense?

This year I was a bad boy so Santa brought me just a cheap uart. For
next Xmas I hope in a WLAN chip or something like that. ;-)
