Possible.  It's also possible people will go back to having many protocols, if
only because it's just another few K of firmware ROM on the device side and the
fibre connection is physically identical.

According to my proposal, we would end up having all network drivers in
drivers/*/net/*.
Currently we have arch/*/drivers/net/*, drivers/net/*, drivers/net/*/*, and
drivers/*/net/*.

I agree with the general statement.  I also think it applies to the current
hierarchy more strongly than to the proposed new hierarchy.  The current
hierarchy isn't logical, but it also doesn't give you a low number of places
to look in for drivers.  My opinion about the next point should be pretty
obvious, and I do believe it is getting in the way of people actually trying
to read some drivers.

Just to avoid misunderstandments, I never proposed creating a directory for
each driver.  I agree it's a bad idea.

I would say drivers/s390/net and drivers/s390/misc are good directories.
They clarify things.  Most people just couldn't care less for them, and
those people can safely ignore all of drivers/s390.  Most people don't care
for sbus, acorn, or sgi, either.  some weird embedded people don't care
about PCI.  Most people don't care about weird embedded people's devices.
