Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This patch has been verified to apply cleanly to 2.5.30
This patch goes back almost 2 years.  First sent on: 30 September 2000
Ignored every time.
The following patch is required so that munmap(0x8000, *) does not cause
ARM kernels to crash.  The problem is that the machine vectors are at
virtual address 0.  Unfortunately, when free_pgtables() is called, it
clears first level page tables starting at 0 in this case, and takes
out the machine vectors.  This then results in an unrecoverable hang.
We already have FIRST_USER_PGD_NR to define the first entry in the pgd
which may be cleared, so we use this to clamp "start_index"
appropriately.  The following patch does this.  Tested on ARM.
