Hello there,
I have this problem with APM in both 2.2.12 and 2.3.20. 2.2.12 does not boot
with APM enabled, I just get the LILO prompt and I can't proceed after I select
the linux partition.  In 2.3.20, if I enable APM it boots and proceeds till
the HDD check and then hangs. I have to reset the machine manually.
The details of my machine are
VIA Chipset. (TX98-3D) with Cyrix-MII 300
kernel 2.2.12 compiled with APM ( with Enable PM at boot time )
kernel 2.3.20 compiled with APM ( wihout Enable PM at boot time )
For now I have disabled APM from BIOS and using the system.
Any  help would be appreciated
TIA
Regards
	Avenger
