glibc cannot survive (at least NPTL) if somebody uses funny CLONE_*
flags to separate various pieces of information, e.g., file descriptors.
 So, all the information in each thread's /proc/self should be identical.
When the information is not the same, the current semantics seems to be
more useful.  So I guess, no change is the way to go here.
