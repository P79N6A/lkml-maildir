Subject: [PATCH] drivers/block/genhd.c kernel 2.2.14
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/3/9/126

	A patch for linux kernel 2.2.14 to enable it to recognize and mount
MINIX 2.0.0/2.0.2 subpartitions. Minix is installed with subpartitions by 
default.
	The patched kernel also recognises Minix-vmd (1.7.0 tested) subpart-
itions. But you can't mount them until Minix-vmd (2flex) filesystem has been
written.
	A tar ball containing a README + the patch are attached. The patch is
small enough that it can be applied to the 2.3.xx series of kernels by hand.
	If any changes are needed please email me at <rajeevvp@yahoo.com>.
I am not on the linux-kernel mailing list.
