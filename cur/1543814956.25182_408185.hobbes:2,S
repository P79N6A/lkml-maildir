Then you'd need to generate a temporary cpumask thing. Not a big deal as 
long as it fits in an "unsigned long", but since the online-cpu thing is 
likely dense in any relevant cpu-mask, I actually think "any_online_cpu()" 
as it stands now is likely to be simpler/more efficient than generating a 
temporary mask.
