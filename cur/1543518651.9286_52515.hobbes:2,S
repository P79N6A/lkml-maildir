This may be a problem with your lilo.  What version are you running? 
What can happen is that lilo will put the initrd into ram that that
kernel cannot see.  I have also seen a case where lilo cuts the boot
string being passed to the kernel by one charachter...try putting an
append="console=tty1" or some other garbage that can be deleted without
a problem.  then, check /proc/cmdline to see if it is getting cut off.
(having auto in the cmdline sometimes throws it off, so you could try
both letting lilo load automatically or pressing enter at the lilo
prompt).
BTW, 2.2.12-20 works fine AFAIK.  I don't think it is a kernel bug.
