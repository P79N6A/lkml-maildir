BTW, just that people know, what we are adding isn't even memory :-) We
are calling __add_pages() to create struct page for the SPE local stores
and register space as we use them later from a nopage() handler (and no,
we can't use no_pfn just yet for various reasons, notably we need to
handle races with unmap_mapping_ranges() and thus have the truncate
logic in).
Those pages, thus, must never be onlined. Ever. It might make sense to
create a way to inform memory hotplug of that fact, but on the other
hand, I wouldn't bother as I have a plan to get rid of those
__add_pages() completely and work without struct page, maybe in a 2.6.21
timeframe.
Ben.
