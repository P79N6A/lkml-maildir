No, not at all. I need only _one_ license to use the code. If original
code was dual-licensed, let's say GPL/BSD, I can chose to completely
ignore GPL part and treat the code as if it was always released BSD only.
Why do you think several components, like ACPI, are dual-licensed?
Intel chose to do that so they can take ACPI interpreter implementation
and use it somewhere else, in non-GPL environment.
Q9. Under what licensing is the source released?
A9. ACPI CA can be licensed under the GNU General Public License or via a
    separate license that may be more favorable to commercial OSVs. Please
    see the source code license header for specifics.

See above. For me it was never GPLv2, if was BSD all the way and my new
code I can chose to make BSD only.
