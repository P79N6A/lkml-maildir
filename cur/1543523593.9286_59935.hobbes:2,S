Wrong approach: too complex, too intrusive, too unreliable.
Just changing root and cwd if they are exactly at the root of the file
system covers 99.9% of the useful cases. Things that access anything else
are likely to have a strong dislike to being "rerouted", because then you
also have to touch the inode. Think of /var/log/syslog becoming
/elsewhere/var/log/syslog, or subtle cases like
ln /dev/tty0 /dev/console  vs.  cd /elsewhere/dev; ln ttyS0 console
No, let's keep this simple. If you try to root-hop a fully running
system, you're almost guaranteed that something will get in the way, or
that you'll screw up something's assumptions in a subtle but
disastrous way. So it's not worth even trying.
On the other hand, changing root and cwd iff at the old root, while
already a bit hackish, still gives predictable semantics, e.g. from the
perspective of the process experiencing the forced chroot, this is
pretty much equivalent to root doing an  rm -rf /  followed by
re-populating / with some other content. A bit rude perhaps, but
something that could happen in the real world. (Unlike a VC becoming a
serial port, file, etc.)
