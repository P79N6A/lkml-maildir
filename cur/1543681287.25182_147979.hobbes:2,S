do you mean audigy2 (and ex)?
at least on ALSA, they are functional but the mixer response is pretty
strage, since they have different routing from sb live and audigy1.
above all, the digital i/o doesn't work well yet.
there is a DSP loader working on audigy, so the configuration can be
changed dynamically.  perhaps in the future version, all dsp codes
would go out of kernel.
