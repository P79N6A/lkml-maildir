Well, almost any SCSI driver does things like
 for (msec=1000; msec--; ) udelay (1000);
after a bus RESET was issued or detected. And the IRQ-safe io_request
spinlock is held.
I am not happy with this, and posted something to l-scsi, but nobody was
proposing a good solution other than major SCSI code rework in 2.3.
Maybe you can come up with a nice proposal.
Since then, I prefer Arca's patch which does both detect the problem and
still tries to the user from trouble.
