Most people felt that a more general capabilities module would be nice
to have.  But, no one offered any code, or volunteered to work on it.
I have no objection to that approach, but am not willing or able to do
it myself.  My opinion is that expanding the scope of the LSM would
significantly increase its security risk.  That job needs to be done
very carefully, by someone with a deep understanding of the kernel's
internal use of capabilities.
Perhaps, Christoph's suggestion could become part of a more general
module, which might replace the RT-LSM in the 2.8 timeframe.  Our LSM
is a modest solution aimed at solving the immediate needs of audio
developers and users with minimal impact on kernel security or
correctness.
