           Summary: print_IO_APIC() is too early in ACPI mode
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0-test4
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: len.brown@intel.com
         Submitter: len.brown@intel.com
                CC: linux-acpi@intel.com
setup_IO_APIC() doesn't know that ACPI is (later) programming the IO-APICs, 
so it calls print_IO_APIC() and dumps the hardware state before the hardware is programmed. 
This output is at best useless, and at worst confusing. 
If this output is to appear when booting with ACPI, it should occur once -- after ACPI has 
programmed the APICs.
