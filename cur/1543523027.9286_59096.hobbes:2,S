I hate to say this... but Windows and MacOS never will generate a READ_6
or a WRITE_6 command.  As such, some vendors don't support the command to
reduce firmware size and complexity.
I've run into such devices when dealing with my USB Mass Storage driver.
This driver emulates a scsi host and talks to USB Mass Storage devices.
For some devices, I have to do an on-the-fly mode translation to turn
READ_6 into READ_10, and WRITE_6 into WRITE_10.  Oddly, I've found that
just writing right over the cmnd[] array in the Scsi_Cmnd structure works
perfectly.
For usb mass storage devices, I maintain my own quirky device list.  But,
given the direction in which the industry seems to be heading, perhaps a
fix at a higher level (to not issue READ_6/WRITE_6) is more appropriate.
