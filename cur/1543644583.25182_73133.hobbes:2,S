I need different transfer functions depending on whether drive
control data(like IDENT,SMART) or HD sectors are to be transfered. 
Control data requires byteswapping to correct bus-byteorder
whereas sector r/w has to be raw for compatibility.
So that will require 2 additional iops pointers and some change
in ide_handler_parser or ide_cmd_type_parser to select the
appropriate version depending on the drive command.
