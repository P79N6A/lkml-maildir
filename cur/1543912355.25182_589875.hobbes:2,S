Hi,
Here are a bunch of fixes for the cs5535audio driver.  None of these are
OLPC specific; generic chip and power management fixes, and one cleanup
patch.  All have been tested on an OLPC (5536), so even though the 5535
data sheet claims to be the same, it would be nice to hear success/failure
reports from someone with a 5535.
