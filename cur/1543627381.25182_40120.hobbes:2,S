Correct.

put_user does not care what value you pass it as val.  It only cares
about the type of uaddr.  The following are all equivalent as far as
the size of the data type written to user space:
	put_user((int)foo, (char *)bar);
	put_user((char)foo, (char *)bar);
	put_user((long)foo, (char *)bar);
