putting it into the vma is just about the worst solution. vma size is 
something we are very sensitive to. Your patch adds:
+       int robust_init;                /* robust initialized? */
+       struct list_head robust_list;   /* list of robust futexes in this vma */
+       struct semaphore robust_sem;    /* semaphore to protect the list */
which is unacceptable. _And_ you were also talking about making it an 
rbtree... why do you want to make it a tree?
also, funky runtime flags like 'robust_init' are just sloppy.
add a separate pointer, and put the above fields into a separate SLAB.  
That way the overhead to the vma is a single pointer. (which might still 
be unacceptable to upstream!)
