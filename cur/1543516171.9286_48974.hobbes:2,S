Could you try adding active termination at the end of the scsi chain?
I've just helped someone with about the same problems as you, and they
got solved by adding active termination to the chain. The Linux driver
has a whee bit of a problem with faulty termination.

That's normal. It'll pause for about 5 seconds on a SCSI bus reset.

Does the BIOS find it during bootup?

I've never seen that here before. Were you able to reproduce that 
particular problem?

They're definately pecky about termination. I'm not sure if that's your
problem, but it may just be...

How do you terminate the chain? The CDROM only has passive termination,
and that may not be enough. The external chain needs termination as
well.

Could you try using active termination, and if it works, (or doesn't work)
let me know? I've been using the driver for some time, with two drives and
a CD, without problems myself.
