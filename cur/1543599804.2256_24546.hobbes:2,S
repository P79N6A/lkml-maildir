... and these dumps are not reliable.  Living thread may modify the
contents of dump as it's being written out.  I.e. you are getting
false alarms - inconsistent data that was never there.
Think of a linked list protected by a mutex.  Half of its entries are
already written out.  Surviving thread removes an element.  It updates
the in-core structures correctly.  The problem being, in the dump
we get part of memory from before that change and part - after.  If
you notice that when you are looking at the dump - welcome to a nice
chase after the bug that never existed.
