Subject: Docs for 2.2 io stuff: sendfile() and async callbacks

I browsed about for info on this stuff
but was not successful...
Is the sendfile() call everyone has been
talking about available from user space?
Where can I get the man page / docs?
I have seen that "async callbacks",
(my wording I am not sure the proper
name) has been implemented in 2.2.
This is where a non-blocking socket
will wakeup a thread (send a signal?)
when there is data ready for reading...I would
like to read some more on this API.
Thanks in advance to anyone
who can point me in the right
direction.
Russ
