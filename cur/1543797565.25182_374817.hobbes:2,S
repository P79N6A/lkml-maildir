Both i_blocks and sector_t handle on-disk blocks in a certain unit.
But their relation seems to be similar to the relation between off_t
and size_t of POSIX.  So adding blkcnt_t makes sense too.  I'll think
of this point further.
By the way, I think there is a kind of confusions on sector_t.  Its
unit is 512 bytes on block/ and driver/ tree, but it is filesystem
block on fs/ tree.  Does anyone think the latter should be fsblock_t
or something?

CONFIG_LBD is enabled not only on HPC but on all major distribution for
server and desktop.  The only exception is embedded system, isn't it?

I think your suggestion is effective only for the problem of stat64,
but other problems would be left on code which handles inode.i_blocks.
For example, ioctl with FIOQSIZE command returns the size of file's
data calculated from inode.i_blocks.  If inode.i_blocks is 0, ioctl
with FIOQSIZE always returns 0 even if the file data exists.
