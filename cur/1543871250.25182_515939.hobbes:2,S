But I AM TRYING TO MAKE IT COMPATIBLE!!!
That's what that config option is there for.  If you happen to be
running a newer userspace, a different distro than what is in Debian
right now, or don't use HAL and Networkmanager, then disable that
option.  Then all of sysfs looks just like it used to, no user visble
changes at all.  It doesn't get any more compatible than that.
Again, I've pointed out distros that work just fine many times in this
thread...
It's been there since 2.6.20 I think, no one seemed to have noticed it
then for an odd reason...
And the default is enabled, you have to manually turn it off in order to
break your machine.
Again, how can I word this in a manner that would be sufficient to keep
this misunderstanding from happening again?
