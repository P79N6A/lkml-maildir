I've been trying to get the new kernels built for everything
in my machine. This includes the bttv driver. At first I tried
to compile it without adding i2c support, but it failed
with missing dependencies. So I added i2c support and it compiled
fine. Should there be some sort of check for this dependency in
the configuration stage?
