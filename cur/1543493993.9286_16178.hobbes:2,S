You were right. I picked up ibcs-2.0-* for my RH5.2 system. However it
still won't compile. I'm working on the x286 portion first. I just
downloaded the latest binutil source since it appears to contain the 286
emulation libraries. *shrug* I hope I'm not chaising phantoms here. 
Do you know if anyone has created an iBCS RPM with 286 support compiled
in?

I sent him mail. From all the docs I thought you were the maintainer of
x286emul. ??
