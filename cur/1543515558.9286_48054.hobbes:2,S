	Let's look at what he says:
> Reiserfs is hereby licensed according to the Gnu Public License,
	I presume he means the _General_ Public License. Note that the GPL's own
copyright terms prevent it from being used except to distribute software
under it.

	This is already prohibited by the GPL. In fact, most of the difference
between GPL software and PD software is that GPL software may not be
integrated with non-GPL software.

	And he's willing to sell exceptions.

	I read it again, it says that it's distributed under the GPL, and he's
willing to sell exceptions to allow it to be integrated with proprietary
kernels.
