This is just a guess, since I don't have a Windows machine to test it
on, but perhaps you're just seeing the effects of Windows automanaging
its own swap file.  Check the Windows Control Panel settings: if
you've told Windows to automatically manage swap, change the settings
to hold swap space at a reasonable maximum size, and see if that fixes
the problem.
If that fails, try running "du" on your FAT partitions, and save the
output somewhere.  When you discover you've lost a few hundred megs,
run "du" on the same partitions again, and see where they differ, if
anywhere.
