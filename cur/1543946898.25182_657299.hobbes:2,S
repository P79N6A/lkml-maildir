I'm really not interested in debating the matter. There are all sorts of 
potential uses for the freezer, but hibernation isn't one of them. We 
*need* to get rid of the freezer for suspend to RAM (because a band-aid 
to ensure atomicity is kind of pointless when the operation you're 
entering is inherently atomic), and once all the drivers are able to 
deal with that then it's trivial to get rid of it for hibernation as 
well. Arguing that the reality of userspace drivers is broken doesn't 
help here. It's what we have to work with.

Then the in-kernel solution has already lost anyway, and I'm desperately 
unconcerned about out of tree stuff.
