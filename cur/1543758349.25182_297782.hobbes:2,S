Thank you, using the workaround below makes it possible to use the
bitbanging code without modifications. It tries to detect i2c_inb() and
resets SDA to high after SCL has been set to high and then to low.
static void pluto_setscl(void *data, int state)
{
        struct pluto *pluto = data;
        if (state)
                pluto_rw(pluto, REG_SLCS, SLCS_SCL, SLCS_SCL);
        else
                pluto_rw(pluto, REG_SLCS, SLCS_SCL, 0);
        if ((state) && (pluto->i2cbug == 0)) {
                pluto->i2cbug = 1;
        } else {
                if ((!state) && (pluto->i2cbug == 1))
                        pluto_setsda(pluto, 1);
                pluto->i2cbug = 0;
        }
}
Regards,
Andreas
