The following patch made A TON of devices disappear on my HP XW9300 
system.  I complained the day it was committed, but alas...

Finally, I was able to get to testing it, and provide proof that a 
shitload of devices do indeed disappear:
	
http://gtf.org/garzik/dammit/
Files:
*.rc4		- rc4, plus some libata changes, PCI domains disabled
*.rc5		- rc5-git1, PCI domains disabled
*.rc5-pcidom	- rc5-git1, PCI domains enabled
As the patch doesn't work, and the description is proven patently false, 
maybe we can now consider reverting it and making a better patch?  My 
Marvell SATA and MPT Fusion devices are no longer available, as a diff 
between lspci.rc5 and lspci.rc5-pcidom demonstrates.
