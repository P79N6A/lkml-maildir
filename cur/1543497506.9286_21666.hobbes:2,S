WHAT install disk?
There is no install disk: it's all on CD-ROM. 
If you think I'm going to use a floppy to boot up an operating system
with, you're wrong. It makes perfect sense to just boot up the kernel, and
start installation from the CD. 
Except it doesn't work unless you can read the CD. Which you can't with
the current PCMCIA approach. 
NOW do you see why I think a user-mode component is simply not acceptable
for any basic functionality?
