Nothing obviously wrong. What happens if you find the line
if (!iomap[0] || !iomap[1] || !iomap[2] || !iomap[3] || !iomap[4])
		return -ENOMEM;
in pata_cs5520.c and change the end from return -ENOMEM to 
if (!iomap[0] || !iomap[1] || !iomap[2] || !iomap[3] || !iomap[4])
		panic("IO MAP");
This should help identify where the problem occurs
