Hi,
I'm trying to get kde2 running and i'm not positive if it's a KDE problem,
or a kernel thing.
Whenever I start kde, the kde startup gets so far and the system freezes.
Sometimes it does it at "Loading the panel" sometimes it'll get to "100%
KDE is up and running" and do it. When it does it the hard drive light
stays on. I can't see if the kernel is oopsing because it's stuck in
graphics mode. Alt-SysRq to sync/unmount disks doesn't seem to work,
because i reset and all the drives go into fsck.
I've tried the following combinations:
kde 2.0 (final and pres)/qt 2.2.1/xfree 3.3.6/kernel 
2.2.15pre18|2.2.18pre20
kde 2.0.1/qt 2.2.2/xfree 4.0.1|3.3.6/kernel 2.2.15pre18|2.2.18pre20
All are compiled from source.
X runs fine with just tvm.
glibc is 2.1.3. gcc is 2.95.2
I used to run libc5, and kde 2.0 would startup fine, but i had many
SEGV/ABRTs making it unusable, which is why i upgraded to 2.1.3. libc5 is
still around just for existing apps.
Nothing fancy compiled in kernel..no I2C, USB, sound, or power management.
Running PR440FX mobo with dual ppro 200s, SCSI drives (i've also tried a
new hard drive), 384MB ram, Diamond Stealth 2000
Any help is appreciated,
-Tony
