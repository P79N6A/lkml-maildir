Sure if the incremental patches are right then this is it. In any case
the patch has not applied but changing that line as per your patch, I
got it working. Now, it loads and it seems that it works. 
I looked at my CPU frequency scaling applet in GNOME and it shows 
only frequencies from 2,8GHz to 2,1GHz. I dont remember it well but if 
I'm not wrong earlier it was showing frequencies until 600MHz. Is this 
possible ?
Thanks & Rgds
