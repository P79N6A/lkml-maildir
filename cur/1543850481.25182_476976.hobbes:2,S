You sure won't have any compliants from Digi International about
removing
the epca driver from the kernel tree.
That driver is *ancient* and I suspect no one actually uses it.
(I am not sure its even useable in the current form in the kernel tree)
We (Digi) have a much newer "PCI-only, rewritten for 2.6.x" open source
version of the driver called "dgap" that all our customers use now
instead.
