Hi Gerd,
/usr/src/linux-2.6.x/include/media/id.h says "/* FIXME: this
temporarely, until these are included in linux/i2c-id.h */". Since these
are now in i2c-id.h, could you consider removing that file?
Reason:
-
#include <media/tuner.h>
#include <linux/i2c.h>
-
...(in a driver) will break compilation...
-
include/linux/i2c-id.h:79:1: warning: "I2C_DRIVERID_TDA9875" redefined
In file included from include/media/tuner.h:25,
                 from drivers/media/video/zr36120.c:42:
include/media/id.h:19:1: warning: this is the location of the previous
definition

Thanks,
Ronald
PS I hope I'm not annoying you with all these small issues, I'm just
trying to find & solve issues that I notice in 2.6.x while doing some
random work on it. :).
