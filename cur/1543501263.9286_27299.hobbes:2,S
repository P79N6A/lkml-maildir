When I tried to build an smp kernel for RH6.0 (2.2.5-15 kernel) Intel, I
got the following error report. This occurs whether it was my kernel (with
a lot of un-needed stuff removed) or the default kernel distributed.

Root device is (3, 5)
Boot sector 512 bytes.
Setup is 3548 bytes.
System is 651 kB
System is too big. Try using bzImage or modules.
make[1]: *** [zImage] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.2.5/arch/i386/boot'
make: *** [boot] Error 2
---------
The compile and link succeeded but it failed to compress. I had many fewer
components and modules in my kernel (than in the CD-ROM shipped default),
but neither mine nor the default would compress. Anyone know what might be
wrong here? When it says, "use bzImage", what is meant?
thanks,
