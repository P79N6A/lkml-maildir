These days it is, yes. Back in 2.0 and earlier days, it was pretty accurate.
I only started meddling with kernel source in late 2.1 days; I'd always assumed
that in 2.0, every syscall grabbed the kernel lock in its own code, I finally
checked the other day and discovered that the architecture dependent syscall
handler actually does it automatically for everything.
