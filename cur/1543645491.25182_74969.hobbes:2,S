This is part of the problem as ever. The name that is used is
meaningless. The module loader needs to make meaningful decisions. That
really means it needs to be able to see the actual loaded module. If we
go to Rusty's kernel module loader then we can fix this because we can
pass the actual module code/data block and sizes to the LSM. At that
point the LSM can do meaningful things like GPG.
In the current form you can say that module creation can only be done by
the right kind of user, and the program "insmod", but even in this case
the module name fed to the LSM seems worthless
