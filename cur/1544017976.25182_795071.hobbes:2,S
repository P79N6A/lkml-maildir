It looks like pci_disable_msi() requires free_irq() to be called first in order
to guarantee the vectors are no longer in use. But I didn't see any code to
enforce that. Which code was "expecting free_irq()" to be called?
I've learned that anything in Documentation/ is explicit - and sometimes stale
and/or just missing (like you are rediscovering). Two years ago I took a whack
at Documentation/PCI/pci.txt and it's probably time to revisit that again and
add references to pci_intx().

True. Want to submit a patch to remove the redundant code?

Yeah, I think you are right.
