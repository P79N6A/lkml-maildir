But in that case, would the value of the anchor= option matter?
This is actually a somewhat philosophical question about what the
mount options in /proc/mounts mean:
 1) Options _given_ by the user for the mount
 2) Options which are _effective_ for the mount
If we take interpretation 2) and there was no anchor (whatever that
means), then the anchor=N option wasn't effective, and not giving it
would have had the same effect.
This could be confusing to the user, though...
Thanks,
