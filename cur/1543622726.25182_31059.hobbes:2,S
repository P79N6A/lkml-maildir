   Windows and Linux dont agree on DSACK options in some
   situations, leading to symptoms you describe sometimes..
There are no options to negotiate DSACK, SACK implies DSACK will cause
no harm.  An pre-DSACK implementation of SACK should effectively
treat the DSACKs as nops, ie. they are harmless.
