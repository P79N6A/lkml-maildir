I got an answer from Jean Delvare:
Try a more recent version of sensors-detect:
svn export 
http://lm-sensors.org/svn/lm-sensors/branches/lm-sensors-3.0.0/prog/detect/sensors-detect
It'll tell you you have an IT8720F chip. Supported by the it87 driver
after applying this patch:
http://khali.linux-fr.org/devel/linux-2.6/jdelvare-hwmon/hwmon-it87-add-it8720f-support.patch
This appears to work fine now!
