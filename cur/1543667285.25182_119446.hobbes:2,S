Anonymous objrmap patches appear to several workloads
a little for uniprocessor K6/2 475 mhz with 2 ide disks 
and 384 MB ram.
Build times for autoconf (a fork test), kernel, and perl.
                           autoconf    kernel         perl
2.5.65                     3845          1641         1348 seconds
2.5.65-mm1                 3898          1646         1326
2.5.65-mm2                 3895          1582         1312
2.5.65-mm2-anobjrmap       3824          1614         1284
autoconf and perl builds were faster with anon obj rmap.
kernel build was not.  kernel build uses pipe more than
autoconf/perl build.  Could be the fact there was only
one sample too.
Lmbench pipe latency and bandwidth don't provide an obvious
explanation why kernel build was slower with anobjrmap.
*Local* Communication latencies in microseconds - smaller is better
kernel                           Pipe   
2.5.65                           15.36 ms 
2.5.65-mm1                       15.80  
2.5.65-mm2                       15.21  
2.5.65-mm2-anobjrmap             14.11  
*Local* Communication bandwidths in MB/s - bigger is better
kernel                           Pipe  
2.5.65                            64.5 MB/second
2.5.65-mm1                        63.3 
2.5.65-mm2                        65.9 
2.5.65-mm2-anobjrmap              65.1 
I'm running 2.5.65-mm3 now and will watch how kernel build
goes there.
AIM7 workloads were generally a hair faster with anobjrmap.

Irman process load starvation still appears in 2.5.65 and 
2.5.65-mm[12].
