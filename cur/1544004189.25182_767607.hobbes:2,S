Yes, but how we decide whether to schedule or not? Let's suppose we do
this without mb(). say, queue_work() starts with
	if (test_bit(WORK_STRUCT_PENDING)) // no barrier semantics
		return;
In that case the code in atkbd_schedule_event_work()
	set_bit(event_bit, &atkbd->event_mask);
	wmb();
	schedule_delayed_work(atkbd->event_work);
can be reordered (if ->event_work is queued) as
	schedule_delayed_work(atkbd->event_work);
	set_bit(event_bit, &atkbd->event_mask);
wmb() can only serialize STOREs, not STORE vs LOAD. The result of
set_bit() can be "delayed".
Now, run_workqueue() does
	// again, no barrier semantics, but this doesn't matter
	clear_bit(WORK_STRUCT_PENDING);
	call atkbd_schedule_event_work()
		if (test_and_clear_bit(atkbd->event_mask))
			 atkbd_set_xxx();
and we can miss an event.

It is not easy document the current behaviour. Actually, perhaps
run_workqueue() needs smp_mb__after_clear_bit()...
But for this particular case this doesn't matter. Note that
atkbd_event_work() does test_and_clear_bit(), it can't be re-ordered
with clear_bit(WORK_STRUCT_PENDING), otherwise even mb() can't help.
