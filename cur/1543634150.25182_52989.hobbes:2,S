What about the bagels? I like bagels! ;)
I agree that this is a problem.  A very, very good example of this is 'binding to a reserved port (<1024)'. A number of programs that should never need to run as root, do, some for the sole purpose of binding to a "reserved port":
        * Webservers in a relatively simple configuration (ex: my Apache install)
        * BIND (which doesn't even drop root. A security nightmare.)
        * identd
There are kernel patches that can help solve this problem. One, found at 
ftp://ftp.v-lo.krakow.pl/pub/linux/patches/,
 creates 'magic' GIDs that give special limited privileges like binding to a reserved port (above list) or creating a raw socket (ping, traceroute).
If I recall the Capabilities FAQ correctly, I think there's something relating to PAM that might let you give partial capabilities to certain users who login (like CAP_SYS_TIME to your normal desktop login, so you can set the clock without using 'su'). It would be nice to be able to (relatively easily) create certain uids/gids (or names) that get special privileges automatically... then certain apps (like ping, traceroute) could be setuid something-less-powerful-than-root.  I think that'd be an interesting project to work on when I'm bored... anybody on this list think it's worthy of discussion (or not worthy -- arguing is fun, it makes for more active threads!) ?
Just remember -- we need root/uid0/whatever, because in the end, the computers are here to serve US, to do OUR bidding. And using root is what I like to term an 'executive override' -- it cuts through all the protections and guards that the kernel has, and makes the computer do what we say. That's why we don't protect root from itself.
