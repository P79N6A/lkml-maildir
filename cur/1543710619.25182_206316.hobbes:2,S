I think it's cleaner to handle this in your .emacs file. Here is what
I use:
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/home/petero/kernel.*/.*\\.[ch]$" . linux-c-mode))
(defun linux-c-mode ()
  "C mode with adjusted defaults for the Linux kernel."
  (interactive)
  (c-mode)
  (c-set-style "K&R")
  (setq c-basic-offset 8))
This way it will work for all kernel files, not just the ones
containing special emacs comments.
