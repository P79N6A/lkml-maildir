It looks like we all misunderstand each other - 
why do you think that if there will be kernel <-> kernel
RNG dataflow, then system will continuously spent all
it's time to produce that data?
_Ability_ existence does not mean that only it must be used.
Userspace daemon should be able to turn it on or off, 
but it is too expensive to allow it to be not only dataflow
controller, but the only random numbers dataflow initiator.
I can create following patch on top of rngd - 
it will read from /dev/random, if read succeds too fast
(or even better just to check pool counts), then rngd
will turn HW RNG assist off and examine received data
to check if it is valid.
Later it can be turned on again.

Such a blocking will be definitely a sign to turn 
HW RNG assist on.
