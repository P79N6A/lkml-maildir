I agree.  This makes more sense to me than some implicit understanding
about the parity of the revision.
rc is easy to understand, and '-pre' is easy to understand
once you recognize it means 'beta'.
I've been bothered in the 2.6 series that rc ("release candidate"?)
tags were applied to kernels that were clearly NOT release candidates.
