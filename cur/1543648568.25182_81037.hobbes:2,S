I'm not involved with the kernel coding, but I've been doing quite a bit of 
user-land SE Linux development (and the first cut at strace support).
SE Linux has currently 52 system calls.  One system call was added recently, 
and other system calls may need to be added.  SE Linux is still in a state of 
development.
Now if every SE system call was to be a full Linux system call then LANANA 
would be involved in the discussions every time that a new SE call was added, 
which would not be desired by the SE Linux people or the LANANA people.  So 
this means having a switch statement for the different SE calls.
So if we accept that it's a maximum of one system call per security module, 
then it's only a small step to do the same for LSM.
Do we expect that SE Linux or other security system calls will be such a 
performance bottleneck that an extra switch or two will hurt?

Also it would mean that developmental projects would be more difficult.  If 
you are doing some experimental coding that's not ready for release then 
there might be a number of kernels released during the development cycle 
before you petition for a number.  In this case you may be forced to change 
the syscall number if someone else gets the number you were working with.
Then when we share patches of experimental software there will be issues of 
syscall conflicts.  With the current LSM setup of a 2^32 LSM calls, you can 
choose a number somewhat arbitarily and be fairly sure that it won't conflict 
and that you can later register the same number with the LSM people.
