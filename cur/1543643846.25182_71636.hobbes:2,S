Devices without serial numbers are treated as if they had different serial
numbers, they show up as if there was no multi-path support.
Special handling is need for devices with unique identifiers outside of VPD
INQUIRY 0x80 and 0x83. This has to be handled on a per device basis, with
special scanning/probing code to get the unique identifier. Some devices
give the same value for page 0x80 no matter what LUN you connect to - these
are the biggest problem, and could show up as you described.
