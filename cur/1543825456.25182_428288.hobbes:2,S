Hello,
I have released another version of the perfmon new code base package.
The patch includes:
	- update to 2.6.17-rc5
	- re-enable debugging
	- fix broken pfm_read(). Sampling was not functional.
	 (broken by the perfmon_kapi.c code)
This patch works with existing libpfm-3.2-060522 release.
You can grab the new package at our web site:
