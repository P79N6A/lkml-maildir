Hi,
I was testing 2.6.22-rc4 from yesterday,
but communication speed  of 8139 side is very slower 
than 2.6.21.* (less than 10kbytes/sec at  
100MBPS,FULL-DUPLEX).
I was not test from 2.6.22-rc ,yesterday I started to test 2.6.22-rc.
So, I *must* set HALF-DUPLEX to 8139 side below:
ethtool -s ethx speed 100 duplex half autoneg on 
*x is number of 8139 assigned from udev.
So,Pls.apply this patch to upstream,and I test this too.
Best Regards,
Ohta.
