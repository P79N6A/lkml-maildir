On raid0 stripes, it's common to have stripes of between 16k and 64k,
so it's rather more common there than you'd like.  In any case, you
need the code to handle it, and I don't want to make the code paths
any more complex than necessary.

No you don't.  You take the existing one, specify which region of it
is going to the current stripe, and send it off.  Nothing more.

What's the point in a common data container structure if you need
higher-level information to make any sense out of it?
