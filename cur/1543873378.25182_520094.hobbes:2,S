I'm not fundamentally opposed, just sceptical on the effort:gain ratio.

Not sure -- i'm often glad I don't have to care about all the old 32bit
systems on x86-64. I have no problem with modern 32bit x86 systems,
but old x86 tends to be very different from new x86. And all the old erratas
are scary.
