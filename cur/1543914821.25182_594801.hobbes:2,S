Also, can you point to good crashme sources, and give the arguments you 
used to run it when it crashed?
The original gjc crashme doesn't even do a "mprotect(PROT_EXEC)" by 
default (nor does it even compile on a modern unix), so it's not going to 
do anything. I hacked it up, and it appears to work ok for me, but I'm not 
at all confident that I'm even close to recreating what you are doing.
(It probably goes without saying that I've not reproduced the oops on my 
Core 2 Duo. Lots of #GP and #PF errors, but nothing interesting.
