Currently fuse doesn't produce dirty pages.  Normal writes are done
synchronously, and writable mmap is not supported.  So sync() should
really be a no-op for fuse.

Maybe there is some other fs operation being done, possibly not
directly, but by waiting for a kernel thread, that does that.
It would be nice, if someone who can reproduce the deadlock could
debug it.  Does sysrq still work during suspend?
