Something weird is going on:
call f001ef64    from f001f08c
     2 w  %o0-%o5: ( f0010d64 f400c9fc f001ef88 fc000624 f400ca04 f0010d64 )
This is arch/sparc/mm/search_one_table, start = f0010d64, last = f400c9fc.
f0010d64 (start) occurs somewhere in srmmu_fault and is bogus, I wonder
how it got into the module_list.
