Hi all, here's a little extra info. on my IRQ problems:
It seems that in rare cases the NIC will actually work, sort-of, just like in
2.2.10.   It will break down horribly when loaded (a simple FTP will do it).
I added a little extra debug output to /proc/interrupts, so that I can see the
enabled/disabled state of the interrupts. It turns out that IRQ8 (which the NIC
uses) is always enabled, even when the driver does not seem to receive
interrupts.
When the card/driver breaks, I sometimes see the "spurious 8259A interrupt:
IRQ7" message.   I suspect this is bad, but is there a deeper explanation to
this ?
The laptop is a Canon (old model) P150-mmx, it has:
 TI PCI1130 cardbus bridge, two slots
 PicoPower Technology PT86C52x PCI bridge
 CMD PCI0643 IDE controller
The NIC is a 3Com 3CCFE575BT cardbus fast-ethernet card (running at IRQ8)
Any help/hints would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
--
