   The access interfaces I'm exposing are pretty simple building block
type features.  It's a toolset to poke at namespace, not a predefined
set of device specific functions.  I'm sure you can mix them all
together and duplicate something that already exists, but trying to
kludge in limitations sounds futile and would reduce the usefulness of
the entire interface.  Besides, given a choice, I kinda doubt people are
going to choose to implement something that requires them to know about
ACPI ;^)

   This is certainly a big gun, but in the software world, I'd rather
have a big gun available than no gun at all.  Thanks for the comments,
