Actually I don't, you just don't like to hear the answer.  I believe I
have stated and restated this several times already.

One more time, with feeling...
a) I, as well as the other early userspace developers, feel that the
advantages of allowing linking nonfree applications outweigh the
disadvantages.
b) I will personally go batty if I ever have to create yet another
implementation of printf() and the few other things in klibc that is
anything other than a thin shim over the kernel interface.  The bottom
line is that klibc is so Linux-specific, that the only way someone would
"steal" code from it is because they want a specific subroutine
somewhere, and as far as I'm concerned, they can have it, and I don't
care in the slightest for what project.
