Yeah, that makes a difference:  the box hangs when I start receiving 
vblank interrupts instead.  However it's not a hard hang, I think X 
just becomes unresponsive.  I can still hit the power button on the 
laptop and the machine shuts down gracefully, but ctl-alt-delete and 
ctl-alt-backspace don't work.  So X is probably still up and in charge 
of input but may not be getting any more timeslices or something.
So to summarize:
2.6.23-rc5:  works
2.6.23-0.171.rc5.git1.fc8 w/o boot options:  lossy interrupts
2.6.23-0.171.rc5.git1.fc8 nohz=off:  hang when starting 3d apps using
                                     vblank interrupts
Sorry it took so long for me to get back to you, I've been out of range 
for a few days...
Thanks,
Jesse
