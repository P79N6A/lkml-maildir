The user cannot always add a memory node to a cpuset, for example if this 
cpuset is inside another cpuset that is owned by another user. (i.e the 
case where the administrator wants to dedicate a part of the machine to a 
user).
The kernel checks for these permission issues, conflicts with other 
mem_exclusive cpusets, etc... when you write in the 'mems' file.
Automatically updating the ->mems_allowed field as you suggest would 
require that the kernel do the same checks in sys_migrage_pages(). Sounds 
not as a very good idea to me.
