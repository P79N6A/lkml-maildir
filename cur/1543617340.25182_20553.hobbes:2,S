device_driver_init() is not that special. It only needs to be called
before any of the bus or class subsystems. So, in theory, you could
declare it __devsubsys_init, and use the link order to guarantee its
ordering.
I don't know about sock_init(). That looks like the core network init,
which is the other type of thing that I had intended for this section. It
shouldn't be dependent on any other device classes or device buses,
right? So, it could be moved as well.
Although, device_driver_init() should be called first. So maybe we need a
__dev_bus_init and __dev_class_init. Or, is that much?

Hey, cool. I'd much prefer this.
I had been thinking about creating a new one for device driver init
routines, and grouping them together. This, however, is only for the sake
of grouping, and doesn't bear any obvious technical merit. And, it would
require touching all the drivers, so maybe not...
