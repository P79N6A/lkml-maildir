Hi.
My brother has just discover a way to kill a linux box :
* lauch an X11 app that use the DGA extension to take control of the
video frame buffer.
* switch to a console before the application take control of the screen
* and see linux reboot instantly (in fact when the program access to the
mapped buffer)
The application may write in a buffer that don't exist.
Contact Sylvain Vignaud <VIGNAUD.Sylvain@eulersff.com> to further
information.
Maybe the problem can be avoided if the console is the fbcon.
