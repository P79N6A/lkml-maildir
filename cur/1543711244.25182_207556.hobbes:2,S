hm, i'm not sure this is the case. It does have a vsyscall page but
doesnt fill out AT_SYSINFO. ia64 seems to have something like a vdso,
passed down via AT_SYSINFO.
We could introduce AT_VDSO to standardize this, and switch x86 from
AT_SYSINFO to AT_VDSO, and all architectures that implement the VDSO. 
I.e. something like the draft patch below. (this would also decrease the
size of the auxiliary table - glibc doesnt need to know the exception
header address.).
(this could also put an end to the AT_ bloat - eg. we could even get rid
of some of the constant AT_ values in the future: AT_PAGESZ, AT_CLKTCK,
AT_HWCAP, AT_PHENT and AT_FLAGS, and move them into the VDSO?)
