Hi,
I am trying to write a module to directly read from
the disk. I have got the sector numbers where the file
present using file system functions. This file starts
from sector 96 on /dev/hda4 for example. The call to
__getblk as
bh = __getblk(bdev,96,512) makes the system hang. Do I
need to add the partition offset also to the sector
number? When I added partition start sector,. I am
getting junk data using ll_rw_block call.
Please advice.
Note: Please send reply to my email address
thanks,
Ravi
