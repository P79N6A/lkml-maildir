I just want to report a problem I saw on linux 2.5.70:
(since I have a workaround, I do not intend to debug this further)
the following program locks up the computer.
sometimes this has happened after about 16MB,
sometimes after about 64MB...
main()
{
    int f = open("/dev/hda1", O_RDWR);
    char buffer[8192];
    for(i=0;1;i++) {
       printf("%d\r", i);
       write(f, buffer, sizeof(buffer);
       /* fsync(f); */
    }
    close(f)
}
when using adding the fsync(), all goes fine!
