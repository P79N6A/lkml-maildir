Thanks for the information.
Indeed they are. Does the patch assume that cpus are numbered in a
row ?
Now, I reverted the patch for ip_tables.c, ip6_tables.c and ebtables.c.
Everything is working ok (11h uptime).
Is this problem specific to the Ultra 60 or sparc arch ?
Will a proper fix be issued for our machines ?
