CKRM can solve this problem nicely. You can define classes (for example,
you can define a class and it attach to a user). Limits will be applied
only to that class(user), failures will be seen only by that class(user)
and the rest of the system will be free to operate without getting into
the situation stated above.

Thank you!! :)

we are currently working on reducing the codesize and complexity of
CKRM, which will be lot thinner and less complex than what was in -mm
tree a while ago. The development is underway and you can follow the
progress of the f-series in ckrm-tech mailing list.

You are welcome to join the mailing list and provide feedback on how the
f-series shapes up.
