If you are not using sendfile(2), it is _more expensive_ to offload
checksums, because we already checksum and copy at the same time.
Hardware checksum offload is only a win when a copy is eliminated.
Therefore, _always_ offloading checksum is actually slower in some
cases, because of the unneeded additional HW csum setup that would be
performed.
