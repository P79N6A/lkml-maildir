It's just retrieving the directory, so it's all cached.  Yes, it's ab.  
If it had to hit disk constantly, I'd probably be able to login, because
the stock scheduler blocks IO bound tasks from achieving max priority.

Ok, it's rare... if you buy your hardware 10 sizes too large ;-)
The load just doesn't matter though, this apache load is by the
scheduler's own standard a cpu hog.  If you eliminate the man made
sleep, those httpds drop right down where they belong.

It's not a tweak, it's a bug fix, and course it will affect other loads.
As things stand, that code is contributing to interactivity, and
fairness, but is also contributing heavily to grotesque _unfairness_ to
the point of starvation in the extreme.
You may not like the testcase, but it remains a bug exposing testcase.
