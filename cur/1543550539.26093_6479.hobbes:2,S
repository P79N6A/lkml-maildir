I did, but of course not with all such distributions and bug reports.

No, what Alan did was proving bad taste, or bad mood, or whatever. This
disucssion simply does not belong here and has nothig to do with the
now-off-topic disucssion about binary incompatibility.
As such, what Alan did was a cheap trick to try to draw attention away
from the real problem. He didn't succeed, of course and I only accurse him
of a temporary bad mood which I can certainly live with ;)

well together, rather than trying to force non-standards onto others.
