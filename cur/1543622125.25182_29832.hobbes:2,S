Ehm, what standard? the standard way has always been ARCH==, CONFIG_PPC
used to be the only place using this and all it did was to make things
uglier and inconsistent.

If you want to do that, then one should use CONFIG_<ARCH> in the
Makefiles as well.

Ehm, most kernel developers will expect ARCH== in Config.in as thats
how it's always been.
