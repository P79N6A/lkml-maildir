Hmm. it's halfway between the two. There does seem to be less sem 
contention, though the profile ticks in __down isn't really an accurate
measure. I'll try to think of some more accurate way to instrument sems
(maybe I can do rdtsc before and after taking the sem, and then hack 
the profiling code to stash delta increment indexed by the callers 
address). Meanwhile, maybe you can decipher something from the attatched
and appended ...
