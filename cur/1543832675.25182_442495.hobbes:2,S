Good point. The reason I did it this way is because I haven't written a
_syscall7() stub for uClibc yet, but I guess I should probably get that
done. I did a quick grep through include/asm-* and didn't find any
other architectures defining __NR_pselect7...

The regular AVR32 call convention uses r12-r8 to pass up to 5 arguments
in registers, while any additional arguments are pushed on the stack.
For syscalls, I've modified this to pass the syscall number in r8 and
no arguments on the stack. arg5 is passed in r5 and moved to r8 by the
low-level syscall handler, while arg6 is passed through r3 and pushed
on the stack only if necessary.
So the best way to implement pselect7 is probably to pass the seventh
argument through r2 -- or maybe r4.

Well, we haven't actually ported glibc yet. But if 7-argument syscalls
is going to cause problems later, we should probably not do it...
