Long Island is a very nice place with lots of vineries and perfect sand

I guess, you are subscribed to the linux-raid list only.  Unfortunately, I
didn't CC my post to that list and one of the replies was CC'd there
without the link.  The original post is available here:
  <http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-fsdevel&m=116603282106036&w=2>
And the link to the sources is:
