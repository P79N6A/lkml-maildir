Having _actually_ dealt with a non-devfs driver under devfs:
1. I had to make 0(zero)(NULL) changes for the driver to work
   with devfs.  None. Nada. Not a line, character, or bit.
2. Once devfs was installed I was able to make significant
   behavioral changes with many fewer lines of code than
   those changes would otherwise have taken. Less debugging,
   cleaner result.
3. It wasn't until several weeks _after_ I had hacked all of
   this that I noticed that there were special functions
   available for devfs that would have let me do _more_!
