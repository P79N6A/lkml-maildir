Thats still in most cases a single compare. The tick timer will mostly be
going off before our time slice completes. Also importantly the more we
context switch the less timers go off - so it scales correctly.

If you are arguing that the PIT makes it impractical on basic x86 then
we are in violent agreement. I don't propose this kind of stuff for the
PIT but for real computers where a timer reload is a couple of clocks
