in that case you will have a lot of drivers that won't work becouse the 
rest of the kernel has changed and they haven't been changed to match.
do you have the resources to test a few hundred network cards, video 
cards, etc? if you do great, hope you can help out, if not why should you 
require other kernel folks to have resources that you don't have?
