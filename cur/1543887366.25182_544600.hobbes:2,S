Hello Pierre,
as I have already stated, I would take responsibility
for I.MX SDHC driver. It is not perfect, but I am trying
to keep and fix it and I would be happy to receive
feedback or help from others.
The actual state is such, that read works for both SD/MMC,
but write is failing. The write path is timing sensitive
and some other kernel changes above 2.6.18 exposes these
problems. I have some ideas, how to dig for this problem
in mind, but I did not find time to try them yet.
I have already proposed MAINTAINERS change, but you
did not liked to point L: field to "sdhci-devel" list.
I propose ALKML mailing list this time as you suggested.
Do you include change or should I send my own patch
for review? Would you suggest change in driver name
to MOTOROLA I.MX MMCI DRIVER ?
Best wishes
            Pavel
My original proposal with L: changed to ALKML
