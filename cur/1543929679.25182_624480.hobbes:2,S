As Kay said, that is to be used once there are proper BDI parent
objects. (The block layer conversion from kobject to device should
provide some).

That is due to a currently silly filename limit in sysfs that is being
worked on by Greg and Kay.

That would be a tad involved I guess, but not impossible.
For block devices you'd need to get hold of the block device name, no
idea on how you would go about doing that from user-space, but I'm sure
its possible.
For nfs, /proc/mounts seems to contain the proper string. And I'm sure
FUSE has the right info somewhere to construct it as well.

Sounds like a good idea, except that I don't find these numbers to be
very convenient to use. Currently ls /sys/class/bdi/ shows a human
interpretable list of names, and its rather clear what device is meant.
Using numbers would loose that.
