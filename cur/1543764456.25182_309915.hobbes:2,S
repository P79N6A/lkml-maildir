Thanks.
BTW, have any of you read the analysis i made, where i claim, rooted in the
GPL FAQ and with examples, why i believe that the firmware can be considerated
a non derivative of the linux kernel. The main points is that the firmware is
not aimed to run in the same address space, even not the same cpu, as the rest
of the linux kernel, and that there is a clearly defined communication channel
between the GPLed driver and the target processor running the firmware.
I further argumented that taking any different stance would bring us worlds of
hurt as we would consider the bios as being a derivative work of the kernel
they are running, or the bootloader, or the firmware present in proms on
devices loaded into the system and so on.
I think only the fact that if you consider firmware as being a derivative
work, you should consider it a derivative work also when it is flashed on the
prom of a pci card or what not, is decisive enough to make those firmware
blobs not derivative works of the kernel they are under.
