Thanks, it's about time someone said this.
We had a preview of what it would be like if "more users tested -mm"
when Ingo's realtime preempt patches were based on it, so the audio
oriented distros briefly shipped -mm kernels.
It was a nightmare.  Most people (icluding myself) experienced daily
lockups.  When Ingo rebased the RT patch against mainline there was
muich rejoicing on LAU.
-mm is just too unstable for anyone but kernel hackers to run.  Anyone
who tells you otherwise is smoking something.
