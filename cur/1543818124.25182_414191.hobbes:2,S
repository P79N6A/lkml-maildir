So don't do that. Treat it as the same case as sending a file path via 
RPC: make sure it's resolved relative to the namespace the program is in 
and not anything under /proc/self.
In practice most desktop apps use "prefix paths" to locate their own 
data files. They don't usually send those file paths to other processes, 
not even in the case of things like GIMP plugins.
So whilst I agree you have identified a place where it breaks, I don't 
think it invalidates the scheme.

Only in a pathological case like running a program that you then rm -rf 
the prefix of, in which case, you lose whatever happens.

That also suffers from namespace conflicts ;)
