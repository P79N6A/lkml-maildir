Hi all,
	I was testing the kernel support for the LMC1200 interface (E1/T1)
and like specified in the help menu a user land tool is needed to
configure
the interface. But during the compilation time is reporting this error
/usr/include/linux/timer.h:17: field `list' has incomplete type
and compilation fails.
I'm using Debian unstable latest update, kernel 2.4.5 and lmc utils
1.34.15
Does someone have any idea on how to fix it?????
I can provide anykind of info if needed.
Thanks a lot
Best Regards
Fabio
