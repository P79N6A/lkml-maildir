Correct, PCI-PCI bridges have to rotate their INT lines (used ones
only, of course). The BIOS and OS would have no way to know the
topology otherwise (especially if the bridge is on a add-on card).

Precisely.

I think a generic card would require a bridge - how would you produce
IDSEL signals without a bridge, and without knowledge about the
motherboard?
If you know the motherboard you know, for example, that is uses
A(D)25-31 as IDSELs for on-board devices and A24 for PCI slot. Then
you can use, say, A23 for card #1 and reuse A24 (or IDSEL from the
mb connector) as IDSEL for card #0. And you know your BIOS will
support this.
If you don't know the motherboard you don't even know if IDSELs are
derived from AD 0->31 or if they are made differently. The BIOS may
just support only one device connected directly to the PCI slot.
I have never seen a riser card with a bridge, though of course it
doesn't mean there aren't any.

Yep, single function -> INTA, two functions -> INT A+B and so on.

Right.

Well, that would be against PCI bridge specs but it probably could.
Normally, a special driver for PCI-PCI bridge is not needed.

Right.
