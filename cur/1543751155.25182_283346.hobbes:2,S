Do you know whether your bios already contains the C1 halt disconnect
fix? I couldn't find this line in your dmesg:
PCI: nForce2 C1 Halt Disconnect fixup
Did it occur with earlier kernels? If yes, this is a regression.
Try as workaround if
athcool off
makes your system stable. If yes, you need above fix activated.
