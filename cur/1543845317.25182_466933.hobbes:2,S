Thanks a lot for your time and help. Still there are a few things a
seemingly don't understand correctly.
Do I understand you right, I don't have to "put_page" after calling
"get_page" in my no-page handler?
Also I'm wondering, why this code works flawlessly on 2.6.10 32-Bit and
several 2.4.x kernels 32-Bit and PPC and is failing to work on x86_64,
only. Do I have to do the "get/put_page" mechanism differnetly on x86_64?
Another question:
In my no-page handler, I reserve the physical page. I do have to clear the
reserve bit of those page after unmap, right? Or is this done implicitly
as well?
Again, thanks for your effort.
