These patches produced a kernel that built and booted first try for
me.  Thanks.  I ran kernbench and your numa_test (schedbench) on 
this numa scheduler (erich44), my simple numa scheduler (hbaum44), and 
a stock kernel (stock44).
Kernbench:

The results seem fairly consistent with what we have been seeing all
along.  Erich's scheduler tends to be about the same as stock on 
kernbench, while mine is roughly 5% better.
On schedbench Erich's does better on small loads, but as 
the load increases to one task per cpu it becomes a dead heat between
the two.
It is probably worth noting that my scheduler change is a bit smaller
with 146 insertions, 27 deletions across 3 files, versus 432 insertions,
127 deletions across 4 files.  But that should be expected, as my goal
was to keep the changes as small as possible, while still providing 
measureable performance gains.
