But -- I think devfs mounted on /devices does this nicely for you. If
you ls -al there, you have listing with names in the right and
major/minor on the left.

Ok, and what is the problem with daemon looking into /devices, finding
out their minor/major numbers, and then mknod()-ing same devices with
correct permissions in /dev? I can see this doable with devfs. (And
yes, you have additional advantage of being able to mount /devices
over /dev if you decide not to use any daemon).

I see no problem in creating library that does readdir("/devices/cdroms/")
and hides it in nice routines you ask for? (But I think ability to ls
/devices/cdroms is _good_ idea.)
