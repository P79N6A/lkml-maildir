Hi Justin,
I've just tested it and I still have the deadlock on SMP. I also tried with
noapic, but it didn't change. I have reduced the TCQ from 253 to 32, and I
had the impression that it was more difficult to trigger, although I cannot
be certain. With 32, I could boot and go to about half the 'make -j 8 dep',
while it hanged during init script with 253. I may retest by the week-end, but
now I'm going to sleep. Now I'm back to 6.2.28 and everything's OK.
Regards,
Willy
