OK, that's a bit different then, but I'm still not sure that there is
much value in exporting these values in sysfs, in particular if there
is no way to reset them.
I am also not happy with the names you proposed: power1_max_input and
power1_min_input are somewhat confusing IMHO, I'd suggest
power1_input_highest and power1_input_lowest to make them clearly
different from the min and max limits we have for other sensor types.
If we have them at all, of course.
