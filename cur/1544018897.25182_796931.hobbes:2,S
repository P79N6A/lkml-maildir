Someone is asking me about the feasability of "scrubbing" system memory 
by accessing each page and handling the ECC faults.
The range of PAGE_OFFSET to "high_memory" should get me all of the 
kernel memory area, but what about all the memory set aside for 
userspace (which may not be contiguous)?  Is there any straightforward 
way to march through this memory?
I suppose I'm looking for something like walk_page_range(), but for 
physical memory rather than virtual.
Thanks,
Chris
