I think that warning is incorrect anyway ... and I'm to blame
for that. What happened is that I had earlier (month or two back,
_before_ the recent change in smp_call_function_single() semantics)
submitted a patch that put an unconditional WARN_ON(1) in this
function for UP -- in those days, both the smp_call_function*
variants were illegal on the current CPU itself.
(

 )
Then recently, Andi / Avi proposed the new semantics for
smp_call_function_single() to allow it to just execute the given
function on current CPU as well -- smp_call_function() semantics
were left unchanged, so as not to break stuff like smp_send_stop().
I think I got confused and recommended the (cpuid != 0) warning,
but I don't really think it is necessary with new semantics --
sorry about this, Avi.
OTOH, the function _should_ include a WARN_ON, but for a different
condition -- irqs_disabled(), as explained in changelog below.
I'd be grateful if someone could apply this, Cc:'ing Andi too.

[PATCH] UP: smp_call_function_single() must warn on irqs_disabled()
Because:
(1) smp_call_function_single() semantics dictate that.
(2) That makes UP behaviour similar to SMP case (implementations
    of smp_call_function_single() in all the archs do this).
(3) We use the unconditional non-save/restore-flags versions of
    local_irq_disable/enable just below this, so it's a bug to
    call this function with IRQs disabled anyway.
Also remove the cpuid != 0 warning that I had erroneously
suggested to Avi earlier (sorry!)
