Please don't do that. Leave it as it is.
If somebody is not happy with the ethX names, use the nameif utility
to change them into more descriptive names. I've successfully done that
on my firewall machine. It looks like this:
# ifconfig -a|grep "Link encap"|awk '{print $1}'
dmz
lo
loc
net
The nameif utility also is the right tool to link a device name
to an ethernet hardware (MAC) address, so you'll never run into
surprises again. Check out my cute little table:
# cat /etc/mactab
loc 00:40:F4:47:EA:65
dmz 00:40:F4:47:EA:64
net 00:40:F4:47:EA:63
And hey, it's all done in userspace, the holy grail!  :-)

Toon.
