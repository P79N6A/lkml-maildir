OT Question. What about an open adsl device? The linux community had been bumped out by the adsl market for at least a couple of years, and nobody knows (or tells) why...
That could be a definitive answer. Is there anybody interested in this?

Mmmh. I can try to do this, but I would prefer to hear Sands about this.

Ok, ok. I'll (try to) behave...

Right, that's what I'm looking for.

Well, fine. I'll "struct _whatever *". But atmsar_dev_t no, that nonono: it mimics the atm_dev_t typedef... It's all around the idea a developer needs to use atmsar_dev_t instead of atm_dev_t...

I used an strcpy() to put the constant string in the buffer. However, I'm changing it this way:
        if(skip-- == 0) {
                count = strlen(strcpy(page, "dnrate:\t"));
                if(dev->rx_speed != ATMSAR_SPEED_UNSPEC)
                        count += sprintf(
                                &page[count],
                                "%ld kbps\n",
                                dev->rx_speed
                        );
                else
                        count += strlen(strcpy(&page[count], "unknown\n"));
                return(count);
        }

Mmmmh. I'll check it out.

That was to give the right wedge to your hints. If you were just around this list, your hints had a different value than if you were a committer. Am I wrong?
