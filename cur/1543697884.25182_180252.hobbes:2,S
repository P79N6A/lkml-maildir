Subject: [PATCH] serial.c 2.4.23 uart_offset fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi Marcelo,
The serial driver has a default of 8 for the "board uart_offset" config that
is implemented at about line 3954 in a ternary expression.  It is well and
good for boards that use I/O port space, but fails in the ioremap call at
about line 3965 for boards that use memory space. The bug is that when
uart_offset is zero, it does not actually get changed to the default value,
so the ioremap call is passed a zero length.
The following patch replaces the ternary expression with an explicit check
for zero and assignment to the default value. This works for both I/O ports
and memory space.  --And it actually compiles a little smaller than the
existing code on x86! 
Please put this in at your convenience after the rc's are done. 
Thanks,
Ed
