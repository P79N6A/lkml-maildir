Should become easier once we start doing physical page scannings.
We could record physical continous freeable areas on the fly
then. If someone asks for them later, we recheck whether they
still exists and free (inactive_clean) or remap (active or
inactive_dirty) the whole area, whether they are used or not. 
This could still be improved by using up smallest fit areas
first for kmalloc() based on these areas.
But beware: We just have a good hint here, which needs to be
   rechecked every time we allocate such areas to become
   guarantee.
Rik: What do you think about this (physical cont. area cache) for 2.5?
