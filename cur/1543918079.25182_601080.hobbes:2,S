Dirt. Booting with "profile=sleep,2" is broken in 2.6.23-rc9 and
2.6.23-rc8 but working in 2.6.22. I was checking it out as part of a
discussion in another thread and noticed it broken in -mm as well
(2.6.23-rc8-mm2). Bisect is in progress but suggestions as to the prime
candidates are welcome or preferably, pointing out that I'm an idiot
because I missed twiddling some config change.

I checked the obvious stuff like DEBUG options being set,
CONFIG_PROFILING being set etc.
