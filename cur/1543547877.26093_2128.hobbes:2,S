Ingo,
KDB is a user mode debugger designed to debug user space apps that's
been hacked to run with a driver.  It's not designed as a kernel level
debugger and in real world situations has tons of shortcomings period. 
If someone is working on a car, do they use a wrench, or just pry the
bolts loose with their teeth?  All this "We don' need better tools
because we are real men" crap I've seen on the list is absurd.  Try
taking a tire off a car with a lug wrench.  It's tough.  But if you have
an air socket wrench, like professional auto garage's use, the tire is
off in under 30 seconds, as opposed to 15 minutes if you do it by hand. 
The whole point here is putting the best kernel level tools in possible
makes development go way faster, and makes it funner.
:-)
