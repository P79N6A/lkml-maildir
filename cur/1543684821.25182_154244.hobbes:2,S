All that can handle symlinks already have the same problem nowadays. Where is
the difference? And yet again: it is no _must_ for the feature to use it for
creating complete loops inside your fs. 
You _can_ as well dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda, but of course you shouldn't.
Have you therefore deleted dd from your bin ?

tar --dereference loops on symlinks _today_, to name an example.
All you have to do is to provide a way to find out if a directory is a
hardlink, nothing more. And that should be easy.

And they never heard of "--exclude" in tar, did they?

This is true. But I am very willing to believe reiserfs is not simple either,
still it is there ;-)
