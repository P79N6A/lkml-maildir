to answer that question with one word: no.
read what Alan said: the HZ exposed to userspace is *constant*. For
example, the i386 user visible HZ is 100, even if the kernel runs at a
HZ of 250 or 1000.... Just when a HZ value gets exposed to userspace,
it's transformed into a HZ=100 based value.
And that's not a distribution thing, that's the kernel.org kernel
honoring the stable-userspace-interface contract, and common sense..
