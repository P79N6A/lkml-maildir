I am seeing similar problems. I am using an all-SCSI system (VIA VP3
chipset, NCR 876 SCSI, Fukitsu 9,1GB (narrow) U-SCSI harddrive)
I am still trying to find out when exactly this started to happen, but is
was early 2.2.x.
I am getting these problems when I just copy a kernel tree and do a diff.
When I do 3 diffs, I get 3 different results, some differences seem to come
back every diff, and when I check the files, they are indeed changed. Some
differences however are completely random.
I am also seeing many frame errors on my ISA networkcard (NE2000 compatible,
realtek 8019 chip). When using an PCI card, these problems disappear, but it
isn't a faulty card, because I tried another one.
These problems appear to be memory or timing related, so I currently suspect
the DMA work-arounds for the VP3 chipset, but I will not be certain of that
before I have tried an older kernel.
I compiled the kernel with both egcs from RH6 and gcc from RH5.2, but both
kernels (2.3.[56]) are giving problems.
I am seeing these problems at least from 2.2.5 onwards... And as far as I
remember the FS corruption and the network problems appeared at the same
time...
Hope this helps to isolate the problem.
