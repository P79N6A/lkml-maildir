Hi Paulo.
Alexander Stohr had similar problems with down and __sched_text_start.
I figured out that what was causing the troubles was the fact that the
linker generated symbol __sched_text_start changed value from pass 1 to
pass 2. The reason for this was the alingment used within that section.
My stamp on this is attached.
I never came around submitting this since I do not know what the correct
number for function alignment is on different paltforms.
