I think you should do everything in kernel space, with a user-mode
interface for non-realtime control, i.e., what characteristics
of UDP packets are being "filtered". You just make a module that
contains what you need, with an ioctl() hook to control it.
That way, data from your gigabit interface(s) never has to get to
"user-space" at all.
