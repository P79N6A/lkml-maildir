"console=8250" probably would have been a better choice.  I think
this could be changed without too much hassle.
It might be possible to extend "console=uart" so one could do
"console=uart,io,0x3f8,9600n8,21285" (where "21285" is a non-8250
UART type).  But that seems ugly to me.  I'd rather have
"console=21285", "console=68328", etc.
I just want the "console=<tag>" to explicitly identify the UART
type so we don't have to poke at the thing and guess what it is.
