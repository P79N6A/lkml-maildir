Sorry, this didn't work out. I still get Tx descriptor dumps, and these:
eth1: RTL8139 Interrupt line blocked, status 5.
eth1: Transmit timeout, status 0c 0005 media 18.
eth1: Tx queue start entry 8  dirty entry 4, full.
eth1:  Tx descriptor 0 is 9008a03c. (queue head)
eth1:  Tx descriptor 1 is 9008a03c.
eth1:  Tx descriptor 2 is 9008a03c.
eth1:  Tx descriptor 3 is 9008a03c.
eth1: MII #32 registers are: 1000 782d 0000 0000 01e1 0000 0000 0000.
eth1: RTL8139 Interrupt line blocked, status 5.
/proc/interrupt looks like this:
           CPU0       
  0:      37029          XT-PIC  timer
  1:       1049          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  4:       1955          XT-PIC  serial
  5:        173          XT-PIC  ide2, eth0
  8:          1          XT-PIC  rtc
  9:          0          XT-PIC  eth1
 10:       1323          XT-PIC  serial
 11:         41          XT-PIC  sym53c8xx, es1371
 13:          1          XT-PIC  fpu
 14:      14947          XT-PIC  ide0
NMI:          0
So, yes, it looks as if there had not been a single eth1 IRQ. But why
does 2.4 get it right, then, even without special boot options?
