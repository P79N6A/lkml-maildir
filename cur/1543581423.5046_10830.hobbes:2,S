The refcnt shouldn't be less than 1, but it is in fact
less than 1.  (As I'm sure you understand.)

True.  I found that with testing---lots of ifups and ifdowns,
etc.---the kernel becomes unstable.

acquainted with the come than I to judge.  Removing the ipx
driver does work around the problem though.
