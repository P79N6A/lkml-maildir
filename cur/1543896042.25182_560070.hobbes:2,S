Yes. As I said, I think this falls into the "just don't do that" category.
But nothing bad happens from the kernel POV.
Also, suppose that some thread does
	for (;;)
		signal(SIGSEGV, SIG_IGN);
Now we have the same situation. do_sigaction() can steal SIGSEGV from
another thread.
Perhaps, the proposed behaviour

is more convenient, I can't judge. If we implement this, sys_signalfd(-1) in
essence means "attach to the thread group, not current". This also makes sense.
But what we have now (with this patch applied) is a bit strange, imho.
