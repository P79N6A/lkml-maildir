Sorry for the delay in looking at this, I was busy with Holidays and
things.
When I compare sg_ring with the current sg_chain (and later sg_table)
implementations, I'm actually struck by how similar they are.
The other thing I note is that the problem you're claiming to solve with
sg_ring (the ability to add extra scatterlists to the front or the back
of an existing one) is already solved with sg_chain, so the only real
advantage of sg_ring was that it contains explicit counts, which
sg_table (in -mm) also introduces.
The other differences are that sg_ring only allows adding at the front
or back of an existing sg_ring, it doesn't allow splicing at any point
like sg_chain does, so I'd say it's less functional (not that I actually
want anyone ever to do this, of course ...)
The final point is that sg_ring requires a two level traversal:  ring
list then scatterlist, whereas sg_chain only requires a single level
traversal.  I grant that we can abstract out the traversal into
something that would make users think they're only doing a single level,
but I don't see what the extra level really buys us.
The above analysis seems to suggest that sg_chain is simpler and has
more functionality than sg_ring, unless I've missed anything?
The only thing missing from sg_chain perhaps is an accessor function
that does the splicing, which I can easily construct if you want to try
it out in virtio.
