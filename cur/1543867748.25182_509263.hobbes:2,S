Well, that's not quite true, is it?  This little microcosm of life has 
its checks and balances, and certainly strives for an equilibrium.
You make a choice, as in Nick's example, to balance the risk of being 
caught, being sued, being shamed, and/or being avoided by customers 
against the perceived rewards.
Negative incentives are present, is the overall answer, even if they are 
not immediately obvious and spelled out in excruciating detail.
