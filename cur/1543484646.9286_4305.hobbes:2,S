I've been running the linux 2.2.1 kernel and have encountered a few crashes.
The error generated on the console is:
wait_on_bh, CPU 0:
irq 0[0:0]
bh : 1 [0 0]
<[c0109ee5]> <[c015d67e]> ....
The system is a dual pentiumPro...
I noticed that a message of this nature was sent to the list earlier today
.. I haven't seen any replies yet, though.
Does anyone know what may be causing this error/crash?
Thanks,
  Terry Katz
