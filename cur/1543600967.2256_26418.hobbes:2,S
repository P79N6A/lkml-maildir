This is on 2.4.8 but I get the funny feeling this maybe hasn't been fixed
yet for 2.4.10:
Sep 11 06:58:08 yeti kernel: md: fsck.ext3(pid 151) used obsolete MD
ioctl(4717), upgrade your software to use new ictls.
I'm runing:
Parallelizing fsck version 1.23 (15-Aug-2001)
Unless maybe I just need to recompile it???
Here's a previous reference I found from Jan 2001.
