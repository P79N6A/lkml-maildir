Excellent.  Glad to see :)  Saves me from keeping on working on my "only
account epoll within epoll for max_user_instances" patch, which would
have just been needless complexity (though cheap - is_file_epoll looks
pretty easy to check for both descriptors) - and I hadn't even compiled
and tested it yet.
Thanks Davide - this will keep our mxes humming along happily.
