I don't know what to think about this.  Can you describe sparsemem a little
further, differentiate it from discontigmem and tell us why we want one? 
Is it for memory hotplug?  If so, how does it support hotplug?
To which architectures is this useful, and what is the attitude of the
relevant maintenance teams?

Would I be right to worry about increasing complexity, decreased
maintainability and generally increasing mayhem?
If a competent kernel developer who is not familiar with how all this code
hangs together wishes to acquaint himself with it, what steps should he
take?
