We can move emulate_step out to arch/ppc64/lib/step.c (and take out
the printfs).

Are you going to send this upstream?

Comments about "trap3" and "interrupt gate" don't help me understand
this function on ppc64. :)  At present interrupts are enabled in a
program check exception handler but disabled in a single-step handler.
When does this function get called?

Hmmm, this seems a bit heavyweight for adding to the page fault path.
Have you done any benchmarks with vs. without kprobes?
On the whole the patch looks OK.  I haven't checked the kprobe_handler
code to see if I think it's all SMP- and preempt-safe, but I assume
you have done it similarly on x86 and checked it there.
Paul.
