Not necessarily if you introduce the trick of doing the mmiowb() in
spin_unlock when a per-cpu flag has been set previously by writel... not
sure if it's worth tho.

No. What I mean is that two consecutive MMIO writes on the same CPU stay
in order, and reads can't cross writes. The relaxed versions would still
require mmiowb() (or another name) for synchronisation against
spinlocks. As I told you before, I much prefer to sync of mmiowb() as a
sync with locks than a sync with "other MMIOs on anotehr CPU" since that
doesn't mean anything outside of the context of a lock.

No, you misunderstand me. That's the main problem with mmiowb() and
that's why it's so not clear to so many people: the way you keep
presenting it as synchronizing MMIO vs. MMIO. I think it's a lot more
clear if you present it as synchronizing MMIOs with locks. MMIO vs. MMIO
is anohter matter. It's wether consecutive MMIO writes can be
re-ordered, wether MMIO loads can cross a write (either because the load
is performed late, only when the value is actually used, or because the
load can be exucuted before a preceeding write). That's what current
__raw_* versions on PowerPC will allow, in addition to not doing endian
swap. My proposal was that __writel/__readl, however, would keep MMIO
vs. MMIO ordering (wouldn't allow that sort of re-ordering), however,
they wouldn't order vs. spinlock (would still require mmiowb) nor vs.
main memory (cacheable storage).

I'm very much against your terminology. It's -not- an IO to IO barrier.
It's an IO to lock barrier. Really. IO to IO is something else. ordering
of IOs between CPUs has absolutely no meaning outside of the context of
locked regions in any case.
Cheers,
