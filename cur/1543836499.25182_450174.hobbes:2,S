I think it would be nice to compare first the features provided by ckrm and 
openvz at some point and agree upon the minimum common features we need to have 
as we go forward. For instance I think Openvz assumes that tasks do
not need to move between containers (task-groups), whereas ckrm provides this
flexibility for workload management. This may have some effect on the 
controller/interface design, no?
