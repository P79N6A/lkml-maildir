The problem is, you aren't supposed to remove *any* cpu support code
with the current scheme unless the kernel is definitely not supposed
to run on that cpu. So a selection of 386 means you have to keep everything.
This gets a bit hairy when you select eg. Pentium 4, and try to work
out whether K7 should be supported or not...
Which is where Adrian's scheme comes in. I guess there are still probably
a lot of other things with better complexity/size saving ratio though,
but I would also like to see it in 2.6.
