There is a real long-term advantage of removing drivers like sk98lin 
because it forces people to report bugs if the new driver doesn't work  
instead of giving them the workaround of using the obsolete driver.    
And this has the (at first sight surprising) effect that removing code  
results in an improvement of the kernel.

You are a regular reader of linux-kernel, and therefore the sk98lin 
removal can hardly be a surprise for you. If you prefer whining over 
helping to improve the kernel that's your choice...
