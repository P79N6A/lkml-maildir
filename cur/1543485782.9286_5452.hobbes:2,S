I have a patch for modutils-2.1.121 that makes depmod uses less memory.
(Basically, I've added a destructor for struct obj_file and made depmod
use it rather than load every single module into memory before
calculating dependencies.)
This patch may now be rather less useful, because of the move back to
C++, but anyone who is interested please look at:

(I haven't yet studied the St Valentine Day's snapshot at
http://www.pi.se/blox/modutils/,
 but obj_load.c seems not to have
changed, so the patch may yet be useful ...)
