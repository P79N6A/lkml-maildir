not so dead here. 2.6.4 is ok, 2.6.5-rc1|2|3 are loaded within the OF
menu, but no bootprompt appears. but: i can hear the scsi disk
initalizing, short after this, the atkbd is recognized and the LEDs on
my keyboard are flashing. then again my nfs-root is supposed to be
mounted, but my PReP still locks up completely upon network-init. (last
working is still 2.5.30).
another issue here: i was finally able to cross-compile 2.5.x / 2.6.x
kernels (on x86). i tried to compile kernels from 2.5.21 on with
"allnoconfig" (was introduced in 2.5.21). only 2.5.30 can be built, all
other attempts to build "zImage" fail...(still compiling 2.5.6x)...
(full logs of builds available...)
