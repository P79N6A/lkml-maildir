I never said that person B lost any rights at all.

Yeah, I know this.

I have, I know all this.

I know all this as well.
The issue is "what is a derived work", your claim is "pretty much anything
combined with the original work" and I don't agree and neither does the GPL.
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.
A loadable driver doesn't modify the kernel.  I understand that the
license says "when you distribute them as separate works" and I think
that the courts will view providing a driver as just that.
Your view that "(b) is compiled into a Linux kernel module, then it
_is_ part of (a+b) whether (a) is physically present or not." is not
something that I have managed to seen in any caselaw.  On the other hand,
it is widely held that you can't force licenses across an API and it's
perfectly reasonable to see the loadable module interface as an API.
I think this is something that is going to get resolved by the courts,
not you or I.  And whether it get solved "correctly" is more a matter
of money than of correctness, unfortunately.  I stand behind my earlier
point that your thinking, Linus, could well bite you on this one.  I can
see how you are trying to work around the issues but I can also see,
clearly, how a lawyer would use your words against you and for SCO.
For example, you haven't puzzled out what happens if there are two
GPL-like licenses which cover work which is combined.  Which one wins?
What if they have conflicting terms?  The GPL *does not* automatically
win, any more than the other license automatically wins.  Either could
win.
I also don't buy your separation argument in the context of licensed
intellectual property.  Your whole argument seems to allow things to
cross over boundaries but then when something you don't want to cross
over does, you start talking about how the work was separated and the
license you don't like doesn't apply.  I may be missing something but it
sure sounds like you are trying to intepret the law one way when it meets
your goals and another way when it doesn't and that isn't real promising.
