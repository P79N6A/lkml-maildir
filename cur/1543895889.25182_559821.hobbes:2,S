You keep smuggling in the same assumption without ever defending it. There
is a user. There is a person who gets to decide what software runs on a
particular piece of hardware. You keep assuming they must be the same
person. There are *MANY* legitimate reasons why the user of a piece of
hardware should not be the same person who controls what software runs on
that hardware.

Exactly, on all hardware. Not "especially free" on some one particular
piece.

Exactly. And they place no restrictions on your ability to modify or use
that software on any hardware you like, provided of course you are the
person who gets to decide what software runs on that hardware.

The GPL is about what restrictions a particule piece of hardware, that
contains no GPL'd software, can impose?

Exactly. For any given piece of hardware, there must be some person or
entity that decides what software runs on it.

Agreed.

There is always the restriction that if you aren't the person who gets to
choose what software runs on a particular piece of hardware, then you can't
run modified software on that hardware.
There has to be someone who makes that decision for any given piece of
hardware. The idea that this person *MUST* be the user is totally alien to
the GPL. It's got nothing whatsoever to do with *ANY* of the freedoms the
GPL was protecting. All of those freedoms very critically apply to *ALL*
hardware in the entire universe.

That right is a right to that particular piece of hardware, it is not a
right to the GPL'd software. Your argument suggests that if I let you use my
laptop, I must let you modify the Linux kernel on it. That's just craziness.
The GPL was never about who was authorized to install modified software on
particular pieces of hardware.

You can see it as a bug, and if you think Tivoization of free software is
bad, then that view makes sense. However, if you see the GPL as being about
getting the software, being free to modify the software, being able to
install that software on *ANY* hardware (whether or not that hardware
shipped with open-souruce software) and if you see the GPL as avoiding any
restrictions on authorization decisions, then the GPLv3 is not "fixing"
something but radically doing something else entirely.
From my point of view, the biggest problem with the GPLv3 is not the change
in spirit but the change in scope. The GPLv3 attempts to control the Tivo
hardware, firmware, and keys, none of which contain any GPL'd software at
all. The idea that because you use GPL'd software, restrictions are imposed
on non-GPL'd works bothers me tremendously.
