I don't really care whose PS implementation goes in.  Believe me.  I try
to stay away from that.  I don't even like my previous implementation.
ALPM has unnecessary performance penalty && is not applicable to
non-ahci controller.  Have you tested ALPM on non-intel ahcis?  There
are a lot out there these days.
I don't think the interface you're suggesting is a good one.  Do you?

I wouldn't have used "might" if I had actual examples.  Well, feel free
to disregard anything following the "might".  I just feel uneasy about
jumping back and forth between PS and active states between consecutive
commands.

Is ALPM enabled by default?  How do they deal with the performance
degradation?
