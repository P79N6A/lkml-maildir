Sorry, I left too much of my train of thought implicit.  I'm suggesting
that it would be cool if there were an mlockf(addr, len, ML_NOSWAP) which
would allow an app to say "do not write this page to disk or send it
over the network."  If the kernel decided to evict that page (due to
doing a suspend, perhaps) it would just drop the mapping, and when the
app next used it there would be a SEGV delivered.
Alternatively, you could define a protocol for suspend to notify apps
with mlocked memory that they must clean up in preparation for a
suspend.  It doesn't have to be bulletproof; you can give them one
chance, and if they don't do it just proceed with the suspend.
(Unfortunately this does violate the "never write key material to
magnetic store" semantic as well, but at least you've given the app a
chance.)  Perhaps just SIGUSR1 or something?
Perhaps a better API than mlockf(addr, len, flags) would be a
mattr(addr, len, flags) with MA_NOFAULT, MA_FIXEDPHYSADDR, MA_NOSWAP...
mlock() could then be defined as mattr(addr, len, MA_NOFAULT).
I agree that all of this is beyond the scope of what you're trying to do
in swsusp.  I just want to bring up the issues so that they're not
ignored.
