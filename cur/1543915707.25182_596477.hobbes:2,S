Looks like process 2382 is stuck with the kernel trying to send
SIGBUS to that bash process, here:
int
force_sig_info(int sig, struct siginfo *info, struct task_struct *t)
{
        unsigned long int flags;
        int ret, blocked, ignored;
        struct k_sigaction *action;
====>   spin_lock_irqsave(&t->sighand->siglock, flags);
