Memory says Linus decided such was a bad idea many months ago, and
unless you can convince him otherwise, any change you offer will get
nowhere.

hwclock can determine the correct timezone based on values read from
the relevant configuration file, these values including the following:
 1. What the timezone is called.
 2. What the offset from GMT is when DST is not in effect.
 3. Whether DST is used in this timezone.
 4. The date and time at which DST commences.
 5. The date and time at which DST finishes.
 6. The offset from non-DST to DST (normally 60 minutes, but both
    75 minute and 90 minute offsets occur, and maybe others).
There are probably other values as well, and storing a table of those
in the kernel for all possible timezones is simply unnecessary bloat.

Are you planning on creating a set of RTC drivers for all the

I wouldn't waste my time implementing it at all, as the CORRECT
version already exists.

If you set the time, you decide whether it's a temporary change (to
allow one to test some time-related bug in a program) or a permanent
change. If it's to be a permanent change, you run hwclock after
setting the time; if it's temporary, you don't.

The two are intimately connected, and you can't have one without the
other.
 > The latter is needed by DOSish filesystems anyway.
What the various DOS filesystems need is a mount parameter that says
something like the following...
 Q> mount -t vfat -o tz=MST /dev/hda2 /win95
...where the "tz=MST" tells it to treat all on-disk times as being in
the "MST" timezone. Anything else is plain stupidity...

See above for proof to the contrary...

Considering the standard of your comments so far, I'll forego the
pleasure of wasting my time.
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
