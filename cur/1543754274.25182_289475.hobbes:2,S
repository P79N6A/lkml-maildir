Weak references are only done once, when the module is loaded.  We
already use weak references for static determination of symbol
availability.  inter_module_* and __symbol_* are aimed at the dynamic
reference problem, not static.
Module A can use module B if B is loaded, but A does not require module
B to do its work.  B can be loaded at any time, or even unloaded at any
time, although that is much rarer.  Dynamic references require a
register/unregister style interface, thus inter_module_* and
__symbol_*.
Does the kernel code really need optional dynamic references between
modules or kernel -> modules?  That depends on how people code their
modules.  If the rest of the kernel no longer needs dynamic symbol
reference then drop inter_module_* and __symbol_*.
