The GPLv2 talks *only* about the software. You're making everything else 
up, and when I point out that your reading of the GPLv2 is insane, you 
just ignore my proofs of your internal inconsistency.

Because Tivo *IS NOT DENYING* those freedoms.
Tivo *respected* the freedoms, and gave source back, and gave you all the 
same rights you had to Linux originally, and to their modifications.
How stupid are you to not acknowledge that?
Tivo limited their *hardware*, not the software.
