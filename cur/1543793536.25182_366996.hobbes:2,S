It would make the APM thread panic on machines with broken APM BIOS - 
which is not very useful except for proving a BIOS bug.  But APM is 
inherently safer than PnP, since there is no transfer segment which can 
corrupt arbitrary kernel memory.
In the history of its introduction, I can not find a single distribution 
or use which undefines this macro.  If anyone knows otherwise, please 
advise.
