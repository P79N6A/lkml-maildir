I think you are mixing apples and oranges. Using volatile to control o-o-o
memory accesses is sure wrong.
It just means "don't assume this variable has not changed because you don't
see any access to it" to the compiler. It is designed to prevent high level
optimizations like code movement or dead code elimination, but a _high_ level.
It has nothing to do with memory barriers and so on. That is surely a
misuse of volatile.
