Hi,
When I use gdb to trace/debug my program, I notice that the programe linear address always start from 0x8048xxx, then I use "ld --verbose" to display the internal linker script, I find an interesting address 0x08048000 :
SECTIONS
{
  /* Read-only sections, merged into text segment: */
  . = 0x08048000 + SIZEOF_HEADERS
  ......snip....
that's where 0x8048xxx comes from. I'm just curious, why 0x08048000 not other number? Any story?
Thanks,
Jason
