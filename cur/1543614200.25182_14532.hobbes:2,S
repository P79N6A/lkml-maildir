Did that in the comments.
/**
 * register_dynamic_syscall - assign a dynamic syscall number.
 * @name: the name of the syscall, used by user space code to find the number.
 *        Use a unique name, if there is any possibility of conflict with
 *        other test syscalls then include your company or initials in the name.
