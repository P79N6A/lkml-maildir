Indeed.  Note that netfilter infrastructure had this from the beginning, but
it sits unused (skb->nf_cache), awaiting someone to get enthusiastic.
There are three real issues:
1) You need a way to say "too hard, don't cache this".  We have
   NFC_UNKNOWN (I looked at some packet field you don't have a bit for)
   and NFC_UNCACHABLE (give me every packet dammit!).
2) You need a sane "selective flush" mechanism for timeouts and rule changes
   (eg. connection tracking and nat).
3) If you want to keep counters in the subsystems (eg. iptables keeps packet
   and byte counters at the moment for every rule because it's easy). You
   need to keep this info in your route cache, then call the subsystems when
   you evict something from the cache.
Cheers!
Rusty.
