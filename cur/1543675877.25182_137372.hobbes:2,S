thank you all for your replies, but i'll give up on this.
i still don't have a useable error-message, so i hope that this 
weirdness will disapear, just as on linux/alpha.
i noticed that i do not reboot the very workstation that often, so 
unpluggin/replugging the kbds a few times a week is ok for now 8-)
thank you,
Christian.
