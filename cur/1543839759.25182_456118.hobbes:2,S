Ok ..we have two types of runqueues here:
1. struct task_grp_rq
	per-task-group-per-cpu runqueue, which holds ready-to-run tasks 
	belonging to the group in active and expired arrays.
2. struct rq
	per-cpu runqueue, which holds ready-to-run task-groups in active and 
	expired arrays. This structure also holds some members like
	curr, nr_running etc which more or less have the same significance as 
	the current runqueue members.
task_rq(tsk) still extracts "struct rq", while
task_grp(tsk)->rq[task_cpu(tsk)] extracts "struct task_grp_rq".
Hence task_rq(awakening)->curr == current, which should be sufficient to 
resched(current), although I think there is a bug in current code 
(irrespective of these patches):
try_to_wake_up() :
	
	...
        if (!sync || cpu != this_cpu) {
                if (TASK_PREEMPTS_CURR(p, rq))
                        resched_task(rq->curr);
        }
        success = 1;
	...
TASK_PREEMPTS_CURR() is examined and resched_task() is called only if 
(cpu != this_cpu). What about the case (cpu == this_cpu) - who will
call resched_task() on current? I had expected the back-end of interrupt
handling to do that, but didnt find any code to do so.
