pci posting is where the chipset internally delays (posts) writes (as
done by writel and such) to see if more writes will come that can then
be combined into one burst. While in practice these queues are finite
(and often have a timeout) it's bad practice to depend on that. The
simplest way to flush out this posting is to do a (dummy) readl() from
the same device. (alternative is to do dma from the device to ram, but
readl() is a lot easier ;)

no not really, not as a general statement.
