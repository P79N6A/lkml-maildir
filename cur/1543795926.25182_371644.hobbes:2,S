Hi Jeff,
IIRC, the kernel (c. 2.6.14) still does nothing to setup the
processors' PAT registers to enable write combining in one of the
slots - the defaults the BIOS establishes do not cover this. Once this
is done, drivers would readily be able to set page flags for a
particular PAT slot, and MTRRs can (almost) be safely ignored.
