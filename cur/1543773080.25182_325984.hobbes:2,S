So how do we solve this problem? We should do a master clear and then
enable channel 4 after a suspend. The question is where. I see three
possible places:
* In the suspend code in kernel/power.
* In the driver actually handling the suspend (ACPI/APM/etc.).
* Via the device layer by adding a device for the DMA controller.
Which would be the preferred solution?
