That is the fault of the parallel port plug and play thingy then. It
should be able to recognize the attached devices. Even if that does
not work for parallel ports, I cannot really consider that in itself a 
reason for devfs -- there is only one parallel port on most machines,
with at most 3 or 4 devices attached. The current solution (static
devices in an overpopulated /dev) works pretty well for parallel ports 
anyway.

Autoprobing IS already in the kernel for PCI, for instance.
/proc/bus/pci/devices contains all the devices on the PCI bus.
PCMCIA can list all connected cards without loading drivers, too. I
presume USB can, but I haven't tried it. IrDA can. The only exception
seems to be parallel ports.

Certainly, but neither of the 3 options are needed, except for
parallel ports.
