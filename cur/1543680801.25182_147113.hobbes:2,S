Subject: Sound updating, security of strlcpy and a question on pci v unload

I'm currently updating the prehistoric OSS audio code in 2.5 to include
all the new 2.4 drivers and 2.4 work. While some of them overlap ALSA
drivers others are not in ALSA yet either.
Firstly someone turned half the kernel into using strlcpy. Every single
change I looked at bar two in the sound layer introduced a security
hole. It looks like whoever did it just fired up a perl macro without
realising the strncpy properties matter for data copied to user space.
Looks like the rest wants auditing
Secondly a question. pci_driver structures seem to lack an owner: field.
What stops a 2.5 module unload occuring while pci is calling the probe
function having seen a new device ?
