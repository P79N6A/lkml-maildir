That _should_ be possible, although I never tried that:
* did you surround all #include lines with 'extern "C" '?
* did you disable all fancy C++ features? exception handling, RTTI, perhaps
you must supply your own "new" and "delete".
c++ modules might be a topic for 2.5 [i.e. add CPPFLAGS to Rules.make, and
add the "extern "C"" in all header files.]
what was the exact error message from insmod?
