Just my two cents.
It looks clear that /proc is for programs, not for humans. So the best format
for proc is just binary values. So programs can read it quickly, even in
a chunk if they know the format. But sometimes it is usefull to do a cat on
a /proc entry.
Question: it is possible to redirect the same fs call (say read) to different
implementations, based on the open mode of the file descriptor ? So, if
you open the entry in binary, you just get the number chunk, if you open
it in ascii you get a pretty printed version, or a format description like
Bus: %d
Device: %h
..
to 'vprintf' the values.
