You've got to give credit to Intel for providing the ucode updates though.
The Ubuntu/Debian microcode.ctl package fetches a new version upon
installation/reconfiguration [1]; I guess if there were ucode updates
that resolved stability/vulnerability issues with Linux, the security
team could release an updated package with new default microcode.
However, I think the package isn't installed per default in Ubuntu
7.04 ia32/x86-64...
