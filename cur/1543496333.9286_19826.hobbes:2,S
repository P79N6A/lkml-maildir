Since the wastage will be only in SMP I don't care too much, I would
prefer to remove the buffer field that is useless instead of dropping a
nice per-pagemap spinlock.

The problem is not how it is frequent. The problem if the code is buggy or
not. If it's not buggy then you could get 2000 printk/sec without having
to worry about them. The case of the buffer code was not safe at least
using IDE software-raids in SMP (I bet it would be not safe also with scsi
raids since the scsi layer local-cli most of the time sigh!).
Thanks for your helpful comments!
