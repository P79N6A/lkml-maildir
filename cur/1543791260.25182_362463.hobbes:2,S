Yes, no problem, but you'll have to tell me what to test ! (a config
or script will save me some time). I have a Sun Ultra60 (ultrasparc SMP)
which matches your description. I just have a doubt about gcc-2.95
availability on this box, I know I have a 3.3.6, do you think that the
problem is gcc-related (too strong optimization or de-inlining, etc) ?

Yes, the patches in hf7 are the same as in 2.4.32-rc2. If you want to try
without, you can download the -split.tgz archive, they're all there. 
Please keep us informed when you have more info.
