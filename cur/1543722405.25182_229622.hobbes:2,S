Well, the horrible name was my fault.
LANANA has been unresponsive and their site states they aren't accepting
2.6 submissions.
Using dynamic minors doesn't work with many distros.  One distro, for
example, opens the console up before /dev is populated by by sysfs.
So dynamic won't work for us but we left it in for the future and to show
we had tried it.
