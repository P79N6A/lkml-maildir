I've made a new UDF filesystem patch for kernel 2.2.12. You can get it
at:
http://trylinux.com/projects/udf/kernel-2.2.12-udf.patch.gz
 (about 70k)
The module has been tested by a diverse group for some months now, with
no reports of meltdowns, so it's probably safe to include in the 2.2
source tree. It was included in the 2.3 tree in version 2.3.17.
I can say from observation that UDF use, in the form of DirectCD written
CDRs, has become very widespread across businesses. Having at least
read-only support in the Linux kernel would be a definite plus.
Unfortunately, write support will have to wait, as the write support in
this driver doesn't work with CDR/CDRWs yet.
