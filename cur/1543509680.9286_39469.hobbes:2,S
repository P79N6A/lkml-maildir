No. Stale NFS file handles result from a file being removed
either on the server or on a different client, while the
client you are dealing with had the file open in some way
(usually happens more with directories than files in my
experience - someone is 'cd'ed into a directory on the
client when another client or the server removes that
directory). Without perusing the source code, I don't
recall the exact events that cause busy inode errors,
but I suspect they are fairly similar. Neither one is
associated with corrupt file systems per se, although
a corrupt file system may cause files to disappear
unexpectedly, which can definitely cause these symptoms.
