Doesn't your GUI show a 'console' window? I don't use the GUI,
but the last time I checked, there was a 'console' window that
showed the error messages. This was standard with Sun.
If you can find the 'console' window in your distribution, activate
it. If it doesn't have one, contact your vendor or make one. There
needs to be some visible evidence that something is going wrong.
Although the messages may 'come from' the kernel, they are not
produced by the kernel. It is not the responsibility of the kernel
to display messages. The kernel writes those messages to a virtual
file, /proc/kmsg. It is, again, user-mode code that is supposed
to put those messages someplace useful. If the user-mode code
isn't doing that, contact your vendor. On this distribution,
syslogd reads /proc/kmsg and writes formatted data to /dev/console
and to various log-files so there already is a daemon that is
supposed to handle this.
A 'console' program, trivially reads /dev/console and writes
to STDOUT_FILENO. That will get all the messages onto your GUI
screen.
