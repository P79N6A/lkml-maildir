In the next couple days I will be releasing the latest version of Pset - the
processor binding/restriction/reporting/other API.  I released an older
version a while back, but it has gone through a complete re-write.
In fact, the kernel patch is ready for viewing, I am just cleaning up the user
lib and tools.
I'll make an announcement here and on linux-smp, hopefully in the next two
days.
