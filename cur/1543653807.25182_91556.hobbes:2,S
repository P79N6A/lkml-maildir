Yep.  I tend to agree there.  A little work to make device mapping modular
in LVM, and a little work to make the md modules plug into LVM, and you
could be done.  All that would be left then is adding the right stuff into
the user space tools.  Basically, what irks me about the current situation
is that right now in the Red Hat installer, if I want LVM features I have
to create one type of object with a disk, and if I want reasonable
software RAID I have to create another type of object with partitions.  
That shouldn't be the case, I should just create an LVM logical volume,
assign physical disks to it, and then additionally assign the redundancy
or performance layout I want (IMNSHO) :-)
