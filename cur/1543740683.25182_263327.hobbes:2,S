Buaaaahhh...
Hehe.
People still use 2.4 because they are not prepared (for whatever reason) 
to or do not want a v2.6 upgrade, but yes, I agree it is deprecated.

As I said before in my opinion drivers in new v2.4.x releases for 
new devices are OK as long as they meet a decent coding and quality 
standard and are well tested.
And, very importantly, benefit a substantial amount of users. 
Having the driver in v2.6 first is pretty much required. 
It has the chance of being put under test, as well as 
passing Linus/Andrew "level of acceptance", plus reviewing 
from other people which is always good.
Mark, v2.4.28 is approaching -rc stage (-rc1 should be out tomorrow), 
we can include the driver during v2.4.29-pre.
In the meantime you can port it to v2.6 ?
