Hi Pavel,
I must have missed part of this thread... can you give me some more
details?  A config, log messages, or some way to reproduce?  Did you
boot in the dock, or outside of the dock?  I tried to just boot the
latest -mm with CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK set to y, and was unable to cause an
oops.  
Thanks,
Kristen
