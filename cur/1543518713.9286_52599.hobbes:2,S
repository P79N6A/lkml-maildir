Hm? How is that supposed to work? In our case, the DMA controller
sits in the PCI device, and the problem is the inadequacy of this
controller.
In the SBUS case, it seems that the DMA controller sits in the
motherboard chipset, and its capabilities are independent from
the SBUS cards.
In the PCI case, the generic pci_map_* would have to know the
capabilities of the PCI card controller.
