I know some have expressed a fear of too much list diversification,
but maybe this would actually be a good case for another list.
Say linux-kernel-bugs or kernel-bugs or whatever, and make l-k
moderated and the bug-list unmoderated.  Then get the word out
about the new list and its purpose ( /., lwn, lhq, etc, should do it :)
Of course, many would have to subscribe to another list, but in
_theory_ with l-k being moderated to subscribers this might reduce
l-k traffic enough to make it worthwhile?
Or is this pointless, as it would trim too much useful content
along with the fat?  I guess it depends on what the developers
feel the purpose(s) of this list are.  Obviously, bug reports
are very useful, but do a large percentage come from
non-subscribers?
One concern I guess is that some may be more cautious to send
mail to l-k than they would to send to a dedicated bug list,
even if it was named kernel-bugs.  So, it could still swamp
the developers on the bug-list with some unrelated stuff.
