It may be better to have them as simple detached signatures, which are
completely separate files (see gpg --detached).
Yeah, gpg currently implements detached signatures
by repeating what gets signed, which is unfortunate,
but the _idea_ is the right one.

Yes, and see my earlier posting.  It'd be easy to store signatures in
the current objects directory, of course.  The trick is to be able
to go from signed-object to the signature; this could be done
just by creating a subdirectory using a variant of
the name of the signed-object's file, and in that directory store the
hash values of the signatures.  E.G.:
  00/
     3b128932189018329839019          <- object to sign
     3b128932189018329839019.d/
     0143709289032890234323451
  01/
     43709289032890234323451          <- signature

Right.  Lots of tricks you can do once the signatures are there,
such as checking to counter repository subversion
(did everything get signed), finding out who introduced a malicious
line of code (& "proving" what key signed it first), etc.
There are LOTS of reasons for storing signatures so that they can
be checked later on, just like there are lots of reasons for storing
old code... they give you evidence that the reputed history is true
(and if you doubt it, they give you a way to limit the doubt).
