Out of interest, do you have some sort of SCSI controller in your
system as well?  I've got a SiI3112 card and I get a hard lock-up pretty
much as soon as anything touches the SCSI bus on my aic7xxx card.
Disabling DMA on the SiI IDE channel seems to work around it, at the
cost of a lot of performance... (this is on stock 2.4.22, BTW)
Setting rqsize to 128 seems perfectly stable for me - my drive reports
itself as a ST380013AS (Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 SATA 80GB).
