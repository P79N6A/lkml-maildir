From the GPL FAQ:
==================================================
Is making and using multiple copies within one organization or company "distribution"?
No, in that case the organization is just making the copies for itself.
As a consequence, a company or other organization can develop a modified
version and install that version through its own facilities, without
giving the staff permission to release that modified version to
outsiders.
==================================================
The bottom line is the Freebox is still owned by Free when you are using
it. It you "buy" it (by not giving it back and paying 400 EUR), you
don't have the right anymore to plug it into free network, thus don't
have access to freebox's firmware.
but please keep that away from the LKML, this is *offtopic* here.
This list is about *developement* of the linux kernel..
