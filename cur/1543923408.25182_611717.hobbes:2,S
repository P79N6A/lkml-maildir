Argh!
interrupt.h contains sti().
sti() on m68k wants hardirq_count().
hardirq_count() wants preempt_count();
preempt_count() wants current_thread_info()
current_thread_info() on m68k wants task_thread_info()
task_thread_info() on m68k is
	(&(tsk)->thread.info)
We're screwed, because adding sched.h to asm-m68k/thread_info.h leads to
even more horrible things.
Comments? Well, apart from "our header dependencies suck" and "let's add
CONFIG_M^*K to interrupt.h".
