Hello!
> void* comparisons are unsigned. Period.
As far as the C standard is concerned, there is no relationship between
comparison on pointers and comparison of their values casted to uintptr_t.
The address space needn't be linear and on some machines it isn't. So
speaking about signedness of pointer comparisons doesn't make sense,
except for concrete implementations.
