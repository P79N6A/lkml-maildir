You shouldn't be able to select SMT if SMP is not enabled.
If SMT and SMP is selected, then the scheduler will recognise
the 2 processors as logical ones.

Yes.

Use sched_setaffinity to force each thread onto the particular
CPU. Use sched_setscheduler to acquire a realtime scheduling
policy. Then use mutexes to synchronise your threads so they
run the desired code segment at the same time.
