This -- or preferably some better explanation -- needs to go into
Documentation somewhere.
Is this supposed to protect my ~/.ssh/private_key from mozilla?
How will it work in case such as ssh? It takes password / reads
private key I care about, then communicates with remote server...

So I will not be able to print my private key?
