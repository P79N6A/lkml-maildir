Hi Jeff,

>TRG is also announcing the NWFS-64 Open Source NetWare File System for
IA64 Linux.  NWFS-64 is a 64-bit implementation of Novell's Native
>NetWare File System on the Linux Platform.  NWFS-64 for Linux Kernel 2.4
and above will be available Open Source from TRG's website at

In what way is NWFS-64 connected to ia64 architecture? Does this mean it
doesn't work on Compaq Alphas
and Sparc64 or other 64bit architectures?
regards,
chris
