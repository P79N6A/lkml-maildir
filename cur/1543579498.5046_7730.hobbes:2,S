Nope, see below.

Sendmail in daemon mode forks right away, and the child is the
daemon.  All init will know is that the process it started exited
right away, and you'll get a "respawning too fast" message.
I don't recall if there's an option to sendmail that says "be a
daemon, but run in the foreground."  Probably is, for debugging.
