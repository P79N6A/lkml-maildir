Because then you have all those special cases with fetching them and with 
fsck, and with shared object directories. In other words: no. 
You can have symlinks (or even better, just a single file with all the
tags listed, which you can create with "fsck", for example) from the tags/
directory, but the thing is, objects go in the object directory and
nowhere else.
