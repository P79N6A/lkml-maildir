Note that request_module() also does waitpid(). So it's better to change
policy upon entry, as You suggested.

Yes, but this semantic change should be ported to all archs
independently of
low level microoptimizations, for consistency. Rename all definitions to
arch_kernel_thread() ?
Btw, how about this tiny bit of cleanup:
asmlinkage void schedule_userspace(void)
{
    /*
     * Only handle batch tasks that are runnable.
     */
    if (current->policy == SCHED_BATCH &&
        current->state == TASK_RUNNING) {
        runqueue_t *rq = this_rq_lock();
        deactivate_batch_task(current, rq);
        // we can keep irqs disabled:
        spin_unlock(&rq->lock);
    }
    schedule();
}
Oleg.
