Hi Linux Folk,
I looking for linux driver for one old JNI Fibre Channel (FC) host bus adapter
model: FCE-3210 "32-bit" PCI-to-Fibre Channel HBA (1999/2000).
I ask google and nothing about driver donload link, just comment and
broken links:)
http://www.exquip.com/products/storage/hostbusadapters.php?view=250
I read that Red Hat Linux 6.0, 6.1 support JNI FCE-3210, but no
information about kernels 2.4 and 2.6?!
From manifacturer docs "Installation Guide for FCE-3210":
>Linux Drivers
>Follow the instructions appropriate for your system: single or dual processor.
>Single Processor Systems
>1. Install Linux and shutdown the system.
>2. Add the JNI HBAs and boot the system.
>3. Download the Linux driver jnifc.o file from the JNI Web site (www.jni.com).
>4. Copy the jnifc.o to any Linux directory.
>5. Run insmod jnifc.o then check the messages file /var/log/messages
for map drive
>information.
>Note – You must have a good link to storage or a loopback before
running the insmod >command;
>otherwise, the machine will hang.
>6. To mount the device, invoke a mount command.
>7. Before removing the JNI Linux driver, use a umount command to
un-mount the device.
>8. Type the command cat /proc/modules to show all loaded driver
modules, and run rmmod
>jnifc to remove the Linux driver.
>Dual Processor Systems
>1. Install Linux and shut down the system.
>2. Add the JNI HBAs and boot the system.
>3. Download the Linux driver jnifc_smp.o file from the JNI Web site
(www.jni.com).
>4. Copy the jnifc_smp.o to any Linux directory.
>5. Run insmod jnifc_smp.o then check the messages file
/var/log/messages for map drive
>information.

I ask JNI tech support, but they don't support Linux with this
FCE-3210 HBA yet. Support is for Solaris, AIX,HP-UX,Windows, but not
Linux!
Follk, if You can't help with driver for FCE-3210 kernel 2.4 and/or
2.6 nobody can!
Any help will be very welcome!
George
