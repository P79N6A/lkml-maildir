Hi all,
Sorry for sending this issue to your attention again, but I got no answers and
I thought it could be because of my bad subject message.
I'm having little hangs while booting with kernels 2.6.12 and 2.6.13-rc1, rc2
and rc3.
Hangs appears just before mounting filesystems message and before configuring
system to use udev.
I'm using Gentoo with vanilla-sources. I already asked on gentoo lists and
nobody saw this behaviour. I tried google with no luck too. So my last
resource which could give me some light is here.
Do you know of something about this? Have you seen this problem?
Where could I look for more information about that in my system? I saw logs
but they don't say anything. Also, besides this hangs on boot, system seems to
work perfectly, but I'd like to remove this hangs from boot.
Thanks in advance.
