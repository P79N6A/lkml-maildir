Which is actually a design flaw on a modern architecture since it may cause
the packet to bounce twice through cache if the network controller is PIO.
Much less of an issue at the time netware 3 was designed

(Fragmented on wire I mean here - sorry - I forgot netware folks use other

Packet burst is in MARS-NWE not the kernel IPX code. Our IPX code actually
doesnt know about NCP at all - so it has no fast paths or kernel helpers for
the cache. It means we are materially poorer but we dont have to maintain
magic for NCP. If you were doing a Linux netware clone you would want a 
kncpd for the cache hit cases
