That function should be:
struct lcd_device lcd_device_register(const char *name, void *devdata,
					struct lcd_properties *lp);
instead.  Then return an ERR_PTR() if you have an error.

Then you need to have a way to corrispond those devices together,
becides just a name.  Use the pointer that you have provided to link
them together some way.
