Hi,
As you all probably know, some routers and other networking products that have 
hit the market recently make use of Linux to drive their hardware.
The Linksys WRT54G is one such product.
I'm pretty sure that the GPL entitles people to the source code used to 
generate any GPLed components of the firmware, such as the kernel.  Since the 
product's firmware image is freely downloadable from Linksys, I'd imagine the 
source is probably somewhere as well.
I've tried sending an e-mail to "pr" and "mailroom" (@linksys.com), about a 
week ago, but I haven't heard back.
There's probably a Linksys employee somewhere on this list.  Perhaps they 
could contact me off-list as to where I can find the source and other 
materials necessary to regenerate the kernel that runs this device?
I'm sure the source is already available publically somewhere.  I just haven't 
been able to find it.
Thanks,
-- Andrew
