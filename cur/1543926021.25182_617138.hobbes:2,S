How exactly do I go about trying out this snapshot?  I did the following:
- exported 2.6.24-rc2 from my cloned git tree to a separate folder
- installed quilt
- extracted the patches to the "patches" directory at the top level of the 
2.6.24-rc2 tree
- copied the list of patches from your mail into a "series" file which I 
placed in the "patches" directory
- ran "quilt push -a"
The result was that all of the patches seem to have been applied, but there 
were many offsets and at least one fuzzed patch.  Should they have applied 
cleanly?  Is quilt the way I am supposed to be applying these patches?  Is 
there a reason that there is no "series" file in the archive with the 
patches?
Slightly confused,
