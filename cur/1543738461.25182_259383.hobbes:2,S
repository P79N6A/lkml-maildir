I'm trying to use dummy console on a SBC which doesn't have a vga 
controller on it.
Is it possible to continue using dummy console if there is no vga or 
framebuffer option compiled in?
The purpose for this, reading keyboard input when pressed and easiest 
way I know doing this through terminal interface.
Or, what method I must use to reading keypress events in user space?
