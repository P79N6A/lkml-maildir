I generally use the following, which have always worked for me:
 Q> make menuconfig
 Q> make dep clean modules modules_install zimage
...or...
 Q> make menuconfig
 Q> make dep clean modules modules_install bzimage
I have found on several occasions that doing the "make zImage" or
"make bzImage" before the "make modules" doesn't work properly, but
have to admit that I can see no reason why not. On the other hand,
I've never had it fail when done in the order listed above...
If anybody can advise me regarding the reason for this, it would be
appreciated...
Best wishes from Riley.
