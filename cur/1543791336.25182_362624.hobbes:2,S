Plenty of features in the kernel I don't use either :) .

Ok, my patches show performance gains and losses on different parts of
Aim9. page_test is slightly down but fork_test was considerably up. Both
would have an effect on kbuild so more figures are needed on mode
machines. That will only be found from testing from a variety of machines.

Not as they currently stand no. As I've said elsewhere, to really
guarantee things, kswapd would need to know how to clear out UesrRclm
pages from the other reserve types.

And a misconfigured zone-based approach just falls apart. Going to finish
that summary mail to avoid repetition.
