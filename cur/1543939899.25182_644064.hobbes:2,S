kprobe_handler has a blanket check for all non-kprobe breakpoints.
They're all left to the kernel to handle. This is fine. Although
external debuggers are free to plant breakpoints anywhere, they should
be discouraged from doing so inside .kprobes.text region. Placing them
there may lead to recursive page-fault/trap handling. It's a defensive
check. I hope I've been able to clarify.
