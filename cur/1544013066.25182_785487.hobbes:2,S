Hi Robin,
Yes, you are right. My implementation does not support a driver that
needs to set/get more than 32-bits of gpio in a single call. I'm okay
with that restriction as I don't see a concrete use case for that. I
understand that you're saying that's not satisfactory. I guess we'll
have to agree to differ.
Thanks,
jaya
