	git checkout -b new-tree old-tree
	# hack on new-tree: rebase, drop bad commits, whatever
	git merge -s ours old-tree
	git push your-public-repo new-tree:public-tree
Now public-tree has a merge commit on the top with two parents,
public-tree^1 and public-tree^2.  public-tree^1 is the tip of the new
cleaned-up history, and public-tree^2 points to the old stuff.
I sometimes use that privately as a way to keep track of the history of
a patch-series, but I assume Linus would shoot anyone that tried to
submit such a monstrosity upstream....
