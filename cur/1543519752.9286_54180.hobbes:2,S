Not quite.  Linuxthreads has always used clone and is an attempt to
implement the POSIX threading spec.  There has been a number of
pthread implementations over the years that were strictly user space.
I think there is a GNU threads or something like that which is still a
user-space pthread implementation.

Solaris and True64 (AIX as well?) have both user-space thread control
as well as kernel threading which is taken care of by the kernel.
With these you can switch between being user-space and kernel threads,
though I don't see the wisdom in this.  The philosophy of these other
platforms are much different than the Linux way of handling threads.
