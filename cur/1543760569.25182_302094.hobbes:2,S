I really think you should not have a hard and fast rule on doc, for the 
case where a fix also makes the mainline doc wrong and someone might do 
something destructive reading the mainline docs and using the fixed 
code. Drivers come to mind.
I am NOT saying this is such a case, I'm just against zero tolerance 
rules when I can see a reasonable case where they don't do what you want.
