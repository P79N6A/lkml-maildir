Hierarchy is not realted to kernel, of course. But need ThreadGroups in kernel
for right signal delivery !

Hierarchy is not belond to kernel.

Let's think about Apache's multi-process multi-thread mode: few processes
with few threads in each. What a gain ? Well, if there are some bugs in some
third-party Apache module then something nasty can occurs. In such case
process will be killed (and few http-connections will be dropped, of course)
but server will be alive. But then you have the same problem as now: you have
web-server not as one process but as bunch of related process'es and you can
not shutdown them easily, etc. So to have different ThreadGroups for sending
different signals can be usefull sometimes. Now in "full version" of thread
support there are two levels: process groups and process as group of thread.
Why to limit it this way ? I'm not said that it's important to have such
ability but if some new concept should be introduced ("Process clusters" or
whatever) then why not implement more generic scheme if it does not introduce
additional overhead ?
