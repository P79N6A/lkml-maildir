Right. Actually, all uses of DEVICE_ID_SIZE in drivers/s390 are wrong.
I'll take care of that.
The only other user of DEVICE_ID_SIZE right now is drivers/usb/core/file.c
and I'm not sure if it's used in the intended way there.
Greg, maybe you want to get rid of it as well, or move the definition
into file.c.
