It's never trivial but don't be discouraged if your report appears to
fall between the cracks - it happens from time to time particularly when

As David says the check will go away in the near future, I reckon it's safe
to ignore the problem (unless David objects) and disable it in your .config
and continue with your testing. As the driver is specific to the One Laptop
Per Child project, I'm guessing you are not affected.
Thanks for testing and reporting.
