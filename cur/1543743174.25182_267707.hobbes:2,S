The patch (wake_idle()) should still make a difference with nonHT 
systems.  It is true that in the mainline code, only HT systems 
benefited from wake_idle().  In fact, wake_idle() probably did nothing 
at all for Itanium, but with this patch it will, since we scan for an 
idle cpu up the domains that have flag SD_WAKE_IDLE (and we addedd that 
flag to SD_CPU_INIT and SD_NODE_INIT).
The patch's intention is to make sure we don't leave idle cpus idle.  
This can happen because the rate at which tasks are activated and 
deactivated is much higher than the idle balance interval, and because 
the task_hot prevents migrations even when we do encounter an idle 
balance tick.
Honsetly, I think you should be able to see the benefits form all 
seciotns of this patch, even without HT.
