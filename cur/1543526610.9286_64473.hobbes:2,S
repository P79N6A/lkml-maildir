Who says running as UID == 0 gives you all capabilities? Why have a
distinguished root user at all? OTOH, it does make sense to have a program
that can modify files belonging to DNS, and which is allowed to bind to a
low port, but nothing else. The UID/GID (and ACL) stuff and capabilities
are complementary.
