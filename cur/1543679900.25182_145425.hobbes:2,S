that's orthogonal, it changes the write throttling, it doesn't touch the
blkdev layer like the other patches does. So if it helps it solves a
different kind of latencies.
However the implementation in theory can run the box oom, since it won't
limit the dirty buffers anymore. To be safe you need to wait 2
generations. I doubt in practice it would be easily reproducible though ;).
