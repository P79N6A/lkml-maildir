[PATCH] I2C: Cleanups to the recent smbus functions removal
This patch cleans up the recent removal of smbus functions proposed by
Arjan and then fixed by Gabriel. Changes are as follow:
1* Discard i2c_smbus_block_process_call, as it isn't used anywhere
   either. I guess that Arjan missed it because it wasn't exported.
2* Document the functions removal, so that people have at least an idea
   that the functions can be restored later if needed.

 All these transactions return -1 on failure. The 'write' transactions 
 return 0 on success; the 'read' transactions return the read value, except
