We are facing the boot failure of kernel 2.3.16 or after on
a 4-way SMP Intel based machine.
During the problem chasing, we found the following suspicious
part in mem_init() of 2.3.16 in arch/i386/mm/init.c.
In 2.3.15, for the page-map initialization, following code are executed.
linux-2.3.15/arch/i386/mm/init.c:
arch/i386/mm/init.c:
401:	while (start_mem < end_mem) {
402:		clear_bit(PG_reserved, &mem_map[MAP_NR(start_mem)].flags);
403:		start_mem += PAGE_SIZE;
404:	}
In 2.3.16, to support multiple memory blocks, a new bios-call was
introduced, and the memory initialization code had been modified.
A part of the corresponding code is:
linux-2.3.16/arch/i386/mm/init.c
440:			if ( (addr < start_low_mem)
441:			  || (addr >= HIGH_MEMORY && addr <= start_mem)
442:			  || (addr > end_mem) )
443:				continue;
444:
445:			avail++;
446:			clear_bit(PG_reserved, &mem_map[MAP_NR(addr)].flags);
Problems are:
1. The condition "addr >= HIGH_MEMORY" in 2.3.16 is useless because
   "addr" is offset by PAGE_OFFSET, this condition is always true.
   It should be "addr >= HIGH_MEMORY+PAGE_OFFSET".
2. The former code assumes "start_mem <= MEM < end_mem", but the
   latter code assumes "start_mem < MEM <= end_mem.
   This will cause unused first page around start_mem and
   nonexistent memory access around end_mem.
This coding is slightely changed after 2.3.17 but the semantics is not
changed.
At least in our environment fixing the above solves the original
booting failure.
