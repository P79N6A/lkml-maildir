In the worst case we will need need nr_objects / nr_object_per_slab off slab management 
structures. There is one off slab management object per allocated slab.

But the slab size is not useful to the caller since the caller does not 
know about off slab structures etc. It is only the SLAB that can 
calculate the worst case.
