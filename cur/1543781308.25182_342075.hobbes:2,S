Although I don't know this board, here are a few questions :
  - are you sure that you enabled the correct serial driver and that it is
    linked to the zImage and not build as a module ?
  - are you sure that you enabled "console on serial port" in the config ?
  - how can you be certain that the serial will appear on ttyS0 and not ttyS1
    or another one (the kernel might detect another serial port which it
    assigns ttyS0)
  - is it possible that you have trouble with the endianness of the image ?
    example: little endian image loaded on big endian CPU ?
Regards,
Willy
