Even though poll is explicitly allowed to take negative values, as per
my man-page:
"#include <sys/poll.h>
int poll(struct pollfd *ufds, unsigned int nfds, int timeout);
...
A negative value means infinite timeout."
Would we have a local variable to store timeout_msecs as well? Or do we
want to make a userspace-visible change like this? I don't have a
preference, I just want to make sure I understand.
Thanks,
Nish
