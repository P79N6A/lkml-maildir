The dependency machinery is designed so that this does not happen.
Only the files that depend on the option you change get recompiled
(see Documentation/smart-config.txt).  I tested this most recently in
2.3.18ac10 when I built about 10 kernels in succession while twiddling
some variables in drivers/block/Config.in.  It worked great.
If I recall correctly, this feature was not in 2.0.XX, but is definitely
in all 2.2.XX kernels.
Can you send me a super-specific bug report?  Something that starts out
by running "script" and then unpacking the tar file, doing the first
build, changing the option, and then doing the second build.  Then exit
"script" and mail me the typescript file.
