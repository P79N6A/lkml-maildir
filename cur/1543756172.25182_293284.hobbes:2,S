Subject: [PATCH] Add as-option to top-level Makefile
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

cc-option can presently not be used for checking as flags. It seems like
MIPS ran into this already and added their own as-option (which at this
point seems to be completely unused on MIPS, so perhaps it's worth
removing entirely from there).
This patch moves the definition to the top-level Makefile so that others
can make use of it (sh wants this with newer binutils that allow for ISA
tuning, for instance).
Additionally, it may make more sense to move the -Wa$(comma) stuff into
as-option directly so it doesn't get repeated all over the place (though
it seems unlikely that there will be enough users that actually care
about this).
