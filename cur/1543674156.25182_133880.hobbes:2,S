It (ExecShield0 is *not* in the mainline kernel at this time. I don't
know when (or even if) it'll be added to the mainline kernels either.
Red Hat's Rawhide kernels (2.4.20-1.1990 for example) seem to have it,
but those are experimental kernels that are not for production use. I
guess time will tell whether Red Hat ships ExecShield by default in
their next release.
BTW, another option is the pageexec ("PaX") patch:

 (warning: this page has pop-up windows)
and that's integrated into a more comprehensive security patch,
grsecurity:
