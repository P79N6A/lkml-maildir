Printk recursion I guess shouldn't happen, but if there is a bug
somewhere in eg. the scheduler locking, then it may trigger, right?
Probably pretty rare case, however it would be nice to be able to
find out where the recursion comes from? Can you put an instruction
pointer in the recursion message perhaps?

Reviewed-by: Nick Piggin <npiggin@suse.de>
for both of them. However I don't feel good to get this into 2.6.24
just for printk timestamps :P But if you can convince others, I won't
stand in your way ;)
BTW. shouldn't we still disable the tsc for this machine for 2.6.24?
Because even if you did get these patches in, the sched_clock still
goes pretty wild if the tsc is not constant. cpu_clock can filter it
somewhat, but it would still lead to wrong values...
