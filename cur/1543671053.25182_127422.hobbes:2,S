Excuse me, but I don't get the last part.  You know that
	F had been built in environment of unspecified degree of security
	from source that had been kept in <--->
	written by programmers you don't know
	who had been hired in conformace with criteria <--->
	and released after passing QA of unknown quality (but you can bet
that they had missed some security holes in the past)
	under a license that almost certainly disclaims any responsibility.
Care to explain how does one get from the trust in above to "trusted to run"?
