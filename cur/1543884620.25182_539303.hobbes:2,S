   Hi,

The function has an effect in page flipping mode only.  It walks the 
whole list of rx skbufs (id is the loop variable ...), checks whenever 
they are handed out to the frontend driver to fill in packet data and 
not returned yet, and if so reclaim them ...

Yep, page flipping is the old (pre xen 3.0.3) way, copy was added (and 
made the default) later.
cheers,
