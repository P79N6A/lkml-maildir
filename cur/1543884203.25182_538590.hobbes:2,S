This clashes with Andi's "msr-index" patch:
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/x86_64/quilt/patches/msr-index
Perhaps it'd be best to wait until msr-index goes upstream and to raise a
patch then.  Or to redo and retest against 2.6.21-rc7-mm2, which includes
msr-index.
Also, include/asm-x86_64/processor.h has a getCx86(), too.  Does it also
need fixing?
