Andrew, please note that I as a user of linux.kernel do actually consider it 
significant. LKML (the gated list) is not part of Usenet and the mere fact 
that at some point it is gated to a newsgroup and transported further via 
NNTP doesn't make it a part. It's merely a service to people (like me) who 
find a news interface more convenient and/or have trouble dealing with the 
large volume of messages via mail.
Furthermore (or "that aside", if you want ... ), although I guess I could 
conceivably be sympathetic to your cause of ridding Usenet from as much 
in-appropriate content as possible, linux kernel patches, including binary 
encoded ones, are not in fact in-appropriate content for linux.kernel, either 
the list or the newsgroup.
Even on the mailing-list plain text patches are preffered, but when the patch 
is large gzipping it is actually recommended:
http://www.tux.org/lkml/#s4-1
You for example today cancelled a completely appropriate post from Art Haas 
(
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0212.0/0302.html
) and I will 
admit that actually annoys me quite a bit.

Fortunately, linux-kernel (the list) has active filtering itself, so anything 
in-appropriate comming in through news will be filtered out in the same way 
as the ones comming in through mail. Of course that doesn't help us NNTP 
readers, but I guess we'll just have to deal with that. LKML is not strictly 
non-binary-only, so cancelling simply on the criterium of binary attachments 
is very inappropriate.
Might I therefore respectfully suggest you keep the bin-cancelling suspended?
Rene.
P.S. offline for a while, so will not be able to reply quickly.
