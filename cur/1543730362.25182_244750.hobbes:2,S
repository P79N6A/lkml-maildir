On my system this setting has absolutely no effect on the skb related
latencies.  I tested setting netdev_max_backlog to every power of two 
between 1 and 128, and regardless of this setting, I can produce a
450-600 usec latency with:
ping -s 65507 -f $DEFAULT_GATEWAY
Looks like skb_checksum is the problem.  Here is one of the traces:
