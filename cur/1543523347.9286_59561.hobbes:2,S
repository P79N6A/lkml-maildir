FYI I am eventually going to convert drivers/char/Makefile, but you are
more than welcome to take that task off my queue ;-)
When you are converting Makefiles, please make sure that the link order
does not change at all.  As more and more drivers get moved to initcall
(module_{init,exit}), link order is the only thing that defines order of
initialization.
