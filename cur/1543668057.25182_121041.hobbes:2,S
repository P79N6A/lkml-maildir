Well, I've answered my own question regarding highmem. Reserving 256MB 
ram causes high-mem mapped IO to fail. I can have penguins, but no 
filesystems or no penguins and a useable system. I'm guessing that I 
could probably turn off HIGHMEM and HIGHMEM-IO and might be able to get 
penguins back, but at the cost of reduced system performance. I'm not a 
kernel hacker, but I might just see how bad I can break vesafb to remap 
only the necessary memory for the requested video mode. Perhaps that 
would fix the whole thing?
