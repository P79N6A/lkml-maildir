keventd is a "process context bottom half handler".  It's designed
for use by interrupt handlers for handing off awkward, occasional
things which need process context.  For example, device hotplugging,
which was the original reason for its introduction.
So it makes sense to give keventd SCHED_RR policy and maximum
priority.  Which should fix this problem as well, yes?
keventd is also being (ab)used for performing disk I/O.
You know who you are ;)  But even given that, I don't expect
that elevating its policy&priority will cause any problems.
