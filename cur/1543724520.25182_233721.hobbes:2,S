I consider this harmful right now, full log:
ChangeSet@1.1743, 2004-06-18 13:35:31-07:00, viro@parcelfarce.linux.theplanet.co.uk
  [PATCH] sparse: rt_sigsuspend/sigaltstack sanitized
  rt_sigsuspend() and sigaltstack() prototype changed; instead of
  playing games with casts of argument address to struct pt_regs * and
  digging through it, we declare them as
        int <fn>(struct pt_regs regs)
  instead.
This ChangeSet causes Java to get killed right away, to see this, just
type "Java". Excluding this ChangeSet (ID
viro@parcelfarce.linux.theplanet.co.uk[torvalds]|ChangeSet|20040618203531|62233)
fixes the problem for me.
Thanks to Go Taniguchi for isolating the change set.
