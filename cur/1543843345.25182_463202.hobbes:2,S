  I could not find anything concerning signal delivery reliability, but
POSIX AIO being part of the realtime POSIX extension, I'd tend to think
reliability should be taken into acount.
  Aside from that could you elaborate on the signal delivery
failures you have in mind? From what I gathered, the only failure I can
see is if __sigqueue_alloc() fails to allocate from the cache or we
reached the RLIMIT_SIGPENDING limit for the task.

  Right, I'm open to suggestions here.

  Well SusV3 states: SI_ASYNCIO - Signal generated by completion of an
asynchronous I/O request.
  From what I understand, the usb core code uses SI_ASYNCIO in two
places:
     - in usbfs_remove_device() and it's a mystery to me why it needs to
       set si_code
     - in async_completed() to notify upon completion of an async IO
       operation which is consistent with the specification
  Anyway, I don't see it as a problem, but maybe I'm missing something.

  Argh, yes.

  That may be a solution if signal delivery reliability is 
critical, so that we fail at submission time.

  Good point, I will do that along with a comment stating the locking 
constraints.

  OK, but then the comment for __copy_from_user_inatomic() in
asm-*/uaccess.h should be changed ("Caller must check the specified
block with access_ok() before calling this function").

  Well, I'm not sure either and I'm open for discussion.

  Oops, that slipped past into the patch, will remove.
  Thanks, for your comments.
