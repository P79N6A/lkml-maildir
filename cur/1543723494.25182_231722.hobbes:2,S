Thanks for your input, Richard.

That's a good point, if the i-cache and/or DTLB are separate from
d-cache and/or DTLB.  Then it makes more sense to put tables in a
separate address block.
However if the caches are unified then it makes sense to put them
together.  Somehow I doubt if any of these 64-bit chips have unified
i- and d-caches though :)

In other words, PA-RISC and SH64 kernels _should_ create exec-only
pages if requested, as the hardware can do it, right?
And the toolchain _should_ ask read permssion for code segments, if
(and only if) the compiler has generated code which needs that, right?
I very much agree.
(Fwiw, Alpha does gives read permission to a write-only request, even
on chips which don't need that for byte writes to work.  Isn't that a
similar case?)
Thanks,
