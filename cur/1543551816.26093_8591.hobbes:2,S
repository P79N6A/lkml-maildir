If I unterstand David right, he seems to be interested (?).

Ok, I think I have already done lots of this.
Actually I ran uw7 and os5 binaries under -test8.
Anyway I think everyone interested in the abi stuff should join.
If no one has a better idea I will setup a linux-abi projects at
sourceforge and check Tigrans last patch and my changes in - everyone
interested should join.
My primary interests are SCO UnixWare and OpenServer now, but I would like
to get some NetBSD binaries working under Linux sooner or later.

OT: is there a way to get betas of the vxfs stuff?
