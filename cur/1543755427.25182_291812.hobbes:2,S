i have released the -V0.7.37-02 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from the usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
the big change in the patch is increased architecture support: most
notable i've merged the MIPS patch from Manish Lachwani. Also, the x64
port should be working again. (To make architecture merges easier in the
future the timer interrupt is not threaded anymore - if this shows
latency problems then we'll try to solve it on other ways.)
to create a -V0.7.37-02 tree from scratch, the patching order is:
