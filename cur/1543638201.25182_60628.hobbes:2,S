Isn't HZ value passed down to userland via the ELF aux table ?
(At least the "userland visible" one, which isn't the kernel
internal one in recent 2.5's, oh well...)
That's a reason I don't understand why Linus did this separation
between "userland visibl" HZ and kernel internal HZ. I would have
just changed the kernel HZ and let userland be fixed to use the
value passed via the aux table instead of hard coding it.
Ben.
