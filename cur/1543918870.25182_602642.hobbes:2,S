It's sparc64 on PCI.

I wouldn't know, the machine hangs and doesn't get any further.

I'm 700 patches deep with an additionally large backlog of
patches to apply for the networking and sparc64 tree.
I don't have the time, which is why I reported the problem
to the OHCI maintainer instead of letting it slip through
the cracks.

At a minimum you should exit the loop and print out a warning
messages and try to continue even without trying to reset the
whole controller if that will take some developer effort.
Anything is better than just hanging there forever.  Not every
user knows to hit ALT-SYSRQ then 'P' to get a register dump to
figure out why their computer stopped booting.
Every register polling loops, without exception, should have a limit
and exit with an error indication when that limit is reached.  It
will never hang someones machine, because although not this time, in
many cases these kinds of hangs are absolutely impossible to debug
(interrupts disabled, critical lock held, etc.)
