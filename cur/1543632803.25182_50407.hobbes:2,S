Subject: INTEL 845G IDE PATCH for 2.4.19-pre10-ac1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I assembled 3 diffs based on a patch Andre Hedrick
sent me the other day to enable DMA on the 845G chipset. Hopefully they can help someone else out.
The diffs patch ide-pci.c, piix.c and 
pci-ids.h.
The diffs are on top of linux-2.4.19-pre10-ac1 
(Thanks Alan).
I'm out of PIO hell, but if someone can give them a quick sanity check, that would be great.
Thanks,
Tony
