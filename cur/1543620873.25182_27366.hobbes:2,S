Yup, they sure did.

Yup, it sure is.  It screwed UML over too.
BTW, if you (or anyone else) still needs to look at working TUN/TAP code,
UML has had a TUN/TAP network backend for a while.  See 
arch/um/drivers/tuntap*.
I've also got persistent TUN/TAP support mostly working in my private pool,
it will appear in a patch shortly.
