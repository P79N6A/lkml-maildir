Indeed, if msync() is called with MS_SYNC an explicit sync is
triggered, and Rik's suggestion would work. However, the POSIX
standard requires a call to msync() with MS_ASYNC to update the
st_ctime and st_mtime stamps too. No explicit sync of the inode data
is triggered in the current implementation of msync(). Hence Rik's
suggestion would fail to satisfy POSIX in the latter case.
