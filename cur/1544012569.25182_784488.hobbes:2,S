Not really. x86_32 did not use the dma_ops scheme.

I guess that you are talking about the dma_map_single difference
between x86_32 and x86_64. As far as I know, Only x64_64 uses physical
address with dma_map_single.

We don't need to touch 20 architectures. We are talking about
unifying dma_mapping_ops. Only architectures that need to handle
multiple dma mapping operations use the dma_mapping_ops scheme; X86,
IA64, POWERPC, SPARC, and PARISC. Unifying X86, IA64 and POWERPC is a
must since they actually share dma_mapping_ops.

No, it's not about swiotlb highmem patchset.
Due to this problem, IA64 and X86_64 share swiotlb in a very hacky
way. We added more hacky code due to this problem again when we added
VT-d support to IA64.
This problem has been for long time. We added ugly hacks again and
again instead of fixing the root cause.
