That is great that such "plug fest" exists and I agree with you that
this is the only way to test compatibility to such scale.

Do you have collected any statistics on Windows server market share per
windows version? I would bet 2000 Server is still mainstream with 2003
slowly replacing NT4 in term of percentage now that support is stopped.
Idealy, may I suggest that dayly testing platforms, should match this
real life Winddows server platform distribution.
