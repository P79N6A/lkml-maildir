Something along the lines of...
	int strlcpy(char *tgt, char *src, int len)
	{
		int size = strlen(src);
		if (size < len)
			strcpy(tgt, src);
		else {
			memcpy(tgt, src, len-1);
			tgt[len] = '\0';
		}
		return size;
	}
...reindented according to standards (which I don't have to hand).
Best wishes from Riley.
