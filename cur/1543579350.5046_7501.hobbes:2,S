You dont want to have too many ongoing writes at the same time to avoid
complete starvation of the system. We already do this, and have to, in a
quite a few places.

The a_ops->cluster() operation will make the VM aware of the contiguous
pages which can be clustered.
The VM does not know about _any_ fs lowlevel details (which are hidden
behind ->cluster()), including buffer_head's.

The address space owners (filesystems _and_ swap for this case) do not
need to implement the writeout clustering at all because we're doing it at
the VM _without_ having to know about low-level details.
Take a look at this somewhat pseudo-code:
int cluster_write (struct page *page)
{
        struct address_space *mapping = page->mapping;
	unsigned long boffset, poffset;
        int nr_pages;
	...
	/* How much pages can we write for free? */
        nr_pages = mapping->a_ops->cluster(page, &boffset, &poffset);
	...	
	page_cluster_flush(page, csize); 
}
/*
 * @page: dirty page from where to start the search
 * @csize: maximum size of the cluster
 */
int page_cluster_flush(struct page *page, int csize)
{
        struct *cpages[csize];
        struct address_space *mapping = page->mapping;
        struct inode *inode = mapping->host;
        unsigned long end_index = inode->i_size >> PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT;
        unsigned long index = page->index;
        unsigned long curr_index = page->index;
	cpages[csize] = page;
	count = 1;
	/* Search for clusterable dirty pages behind */
	....
	/* Search for clusterable dirty pages ahead */
	...
	/* Write all of them */
	for(i=0; i<count; i++) {
		ClearPageDirty(cpages[i]);
		writepage(cpages[i]);  
	...
}
This way we have _one_ clean implementation of write clustering without
any lowlevel crap involved. Try to imagine the amount of code people will
manage to write in their own fs's to implement write clustering.
