Generally, read linux/Documentation/Submitting*
and post the patch file to the appropriate mailing list(s)
for review.  After review and modifications, send it to
torvalds@transmeta.com and ask for it to be added to the
next version of the development kernel.
After it survives in the development kernel for awhile,
it might also be added to the stable kernel if it's not
a kernel interface change (e.g., a device driver or a
file system).
