We could, and it would be easy and almost as efficient in all places
where div_long_long_rem() is being used:
   value->tv_sec = div_long_long_rem(nsec, NSEC_PER_SEC, &value->tv_nsec);
becomes:
   value->tv_nsec = do_div(nsec, NSEC_PER_SEC);
   value->tv_sec = nsec;
George, do you agree? May I go on and post a patch killing
div_long_long_rem() everywhere?

Oops. Fixed. I had just copied it over from asm-i386/div64.h.
Is it worth posting a big patch to replace all remaining
occurrences of 'extern inline' all over the kernel?
I'd also like to point out that __inline__ is often being
used inconsistently. We should be using __inline__ rather
than inline in public headers needed by glibc for apps
compiled with -ansi. Since it's so ugly, it shouldn't
be used in other places.
