Well, with respect to MSI, yes it could.  Interrupt values are
still a Linux fabrication regardless on many platforms with
cascaded PICs.

Yes, it's a bit.  Just pointing out that one *could* do it that way,
not really that we *should* do it that way.  I would personally
prefer to see native msi support.  However, most of the functionality
I mentioned are things the PCI subsystem needs to do specific to
PCI MSI anyway.

request_msi() needs an additional parameter to specify which MSI
it is hooking.  A device can implement many messages in order to
clarify which one of many events on a device has occurred.  It
may be desired to hook a separate handler for each of those to
avoid another read of a status register.
