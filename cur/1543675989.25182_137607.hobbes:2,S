I don't care much, but that zero special case is definitely not a good 
idea.
You might make the thing acceptable to me by just removing the "zero means 
everythign", and replacing that logic with
	if (!tgid)
		tgid = current->tgid;
which is similar to how we handle zeroes in some other places. In other 
words, a zero is not a "wildcard", it means "_this_ thread group".
