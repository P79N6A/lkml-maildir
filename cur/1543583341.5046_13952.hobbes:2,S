Hello
I try to upgrade one of my servers with 2.4.2 and than 2.4.2ac6
and got strage locks when I start my netfilter firewall
Strange I have that this script work ok on my individual PC
I copy this script to server, change opened ports and start it
In this script I you connection track, flags checks, limit module and
standart tcp/udp acception and rejection
When I remove any tracks and flag check PC seems to work ok (in
firewall I make only simple check tcp/udp ports with acception and
limit in logging nothing else)
And I can't understand why this script work ok on my PC but wan't work
at this server.
Defference in kernel configuration I can found:
- no ip forward on server
- no advanced routing on server
- and no alternative queue on server
