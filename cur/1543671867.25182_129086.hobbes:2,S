Subject: RH8.0 - 2.4.18-27 System gets wedged in jbd:do_get_write_access

I've got a system that has been locking up on me pretty frequently for a 
while.  It is currently running RH 8.0 kernel 2.4.18-27, but the problem 
has been present at previous versions.  I suspect a hardware issue of 
some kind, since most of our systems are running this software, but am 
not getting any error messages.
I've installed the debug kernel, and using kdb alt-sysreq-p have 
determined that all of the tasks get hung up in 
"jbd:do_get_write_access".  Basic scheduling is still working, but 
anything that attempts to access the disk hangs.
Are there any other steps I can take to debug?  I've run basic hard disk 
read diagnostics and not found any problems, as well as memtst86.
Thank you,
  Orion Poplawski
