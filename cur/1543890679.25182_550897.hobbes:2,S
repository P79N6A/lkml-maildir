I think that JFFS2 is doing the work of looking for PRESET_DICT itself not 
only to skip the checksum calc, but also to lose the function-call overhead. 
Yes, the performance difference shouldn't be all that great, but might have 
made a difference in some test. When I'm done working on the 
benchmark/testbed for the LZO code proposed for inclusion in the kernel I'll 
do some testing and see how large the difference is in userspace. (for most 
code the differences hold true, though usually with less drastic numbers, in 
kernel)
