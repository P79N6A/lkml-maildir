   I _highly_ suspect that this is not a 2.4 bug but is instead user error.
   I've seen it several times.
   On all kernel versions prior to 2.3.11 if you compiled with the CPU set
   to a newer model then you had (for instance, of you selected "Pentium Pro"
   and you actually had a 486) you would get a kernel that worked fine albiet
   not optimally.  On kernels 2.3.11 you will have an unbootable kernel.
Yup, that sounds like it.  Could someone with a Thinkpad 390 confirm
that they can boot with a properly configured kernel?  Many thanks.
(Bug now moved to "Should be fixed, confirmation wanted")
