Wasn't there something about groups and NFS? I remember configuring solaris
once to allow for more than 32 groups for a single user, and NFS for those
users that we in more than 32 groups would break horribly. Granted, one
should not use NFS, if it can be avoided, nor is it reasonable to impose NFS
limitations on environments that don't use NFS, still, I think it's a good
thing to ehh, maybe have to enable the use of more than 32 groups in some
/proc file....
Oh btw. In none of our current environments, we actually run into this 32
group limit, not even in the really big ones.....
