Hi all,
	I just joined this list, so my appologies if this has been addressed already.
I'm getting errors when compiling. It seems the the function "get_cached_page"
does not exist anymore. I traced it down from older versions and it used to be
in the ../mm/filemap.c program. It's missing in the 2.3.9 version. The
usmsdos.c and smbfs.c files are two of the ones complaining.
