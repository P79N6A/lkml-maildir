CH> Right.  Please submit a patch to James.
I think this would cause some troubles. I would have to include
linux/dma-mapping in driver/scsi/scsi.h, but many non-PCI
architectures are still including asm-generic/dma-mapping.h, which has
lots of references to PCI functions... I'm afraid this would clash
badly on, say, sparc or m68k...

I totally agree with the rest of your comments, and will submit an
updated patch shortly.
Thanks,
        M.
