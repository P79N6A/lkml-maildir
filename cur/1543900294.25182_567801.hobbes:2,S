Yes, I agree that's the right way to go.  Aside from fixing Bob's
crash, it also liberates ALSA from needing GFP_ATOMIC there on Alpha.
Couple of GFP_ notes below.

The canonical form for this masking, even on arches without HIGHMEM,
appears to be:
	gfp &= ~(__GFP_DMA | __GFP_HIGHMEM);
But I guess that won't make any actual difference.

I was going to ask you why that needs to be GFP_ATOMIC on Alpha.
But find you're following the example of asm-generic and others.
So really should be asking Sparc how it gets away with GFP_KERNEL.
