But its not an LPC driver, it only uses a small piece of the LPC, we
really do need some sort of bridge driver layer or something for
these, then other drivers can sit on top of that,
The DRM still uses pci_find_device for the exact same reason, the fb
drivers take the PCI device and we have been told we can't use the
proper interface, hence one of the needs to merge fb and DRM..
