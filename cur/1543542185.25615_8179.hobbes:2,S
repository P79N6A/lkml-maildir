The idea is to have a different value for loops_per_sec for all
(read: 12) clock speeds. I want to calculate the values when the
driver loads so I can just plug in a new value for loops_per_sec
at a clock speed change. If I disable all interrupts while
recalibrating it shouldn't hurt udelay, right?

How correct is that? More specifically: how sensitive are the other
drivers for slightly incorrect values of loops_per_sec?
