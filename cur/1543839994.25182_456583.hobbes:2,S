I turned off the tracing in the latency tracking stuff and a relatively
small patch is here against -rt8:
	
http://mmlinux.sourceforge.net/public/against-2.6.17-rt8-0.diff
This might help with the stack trace. The stack trace being kind of clobbered is a
different issue entirely. I don't know since I can't replicate your problem over here.
I'm going to start looking over the rt mutex more carefully and see what case might
make this assert trigger. I'll try and deal with this one and a time.
I'm new at this bug fixing thing so give me a bit of time. Apparently Ingo's on
long vacation.
