That would shootdown the ptes to add completely coherency to the mmaps, right.
Still we could shootdown the ptes after clearing the uptodate bitflag,
allowing the mapped page to be not uptodate for a short while, since it
makes sense and it's harmless. The pte shootdown from my point of view
is just an additional coherency feature, but it cannot provide full
coherency anyways, since the invalidate arrives after the I/O hit the
disk, so the page will be out of sync with the disk if it's dirty, and
no coherency can be provided anyways, because no locking happens to get
max scalability.

yes, this is actually the only bug I can see in this whole affair
(besdies the BUG that goes away with the patch already posted, and that
patch still makes perfect sense to me since we could use it even for a
more relaxed pte shootdown as described above, plus it doesn't worth to
mark not-uptodate pages as dirty, that is really what makes no sense and
needs fixing).

nfs is a case here too. But this is mostly needed for O_DIRECT write
happening on a file that is mmapped and read in buffered mode at the
same time. The API totally ignores the mapping, but we must guarantee
buffered read to see the written data on disk, and in turn the uptodate
bitflag must be clared because the page is not uptodate anymore. This 
just describes what has happened on disk and it tells to _future_ page
faults (or buffered read syscalls) they've to re-read from disk. The
only issue seems to be the bhs. Peraphs te bhs requires a new bitflag if
the fs risks an hearth attack, but the VM can do the natural thing of
clearing the uptodate bitflag reflecting the fact the cache is
out-of-date, since the VM can deal with that just fine.
