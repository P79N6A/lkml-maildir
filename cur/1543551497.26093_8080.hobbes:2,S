I have been fighting with RH 7.0 trying to make it
work with devfs and the lk 2.4 series. This is the
second time round the loop as I did the same with
RH 6.2 .
The /etc/securetty file no longer needs to be changed
but /etc/security/console.perms needs a different
patch to allow non-root users to start X:

Hopefully this patch does not compromise security.
