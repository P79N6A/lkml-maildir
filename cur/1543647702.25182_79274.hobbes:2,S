No I'm afraid not. The lcpu% cant estimate accurately the cpu% used by the 
load while the kernel is actually being compiled as the load starts before 
ther kernel compilation and ends after it. This means that lcpu% will always 
overestimate the loads' cpu%. I haven't found a workaround for this... yet
