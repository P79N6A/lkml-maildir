Then its definition does not make any sense whatsoever -- as said just now 
as well, moderation takes some effort so lists that do have made the 
explicit choice to _not_ become subscriber-only.
Moderation is furthermore not something the poster needs to concern himself 
with, other than through being aware of a possible delay. It's mostly those 
poor moderators that wade through bucket-loads of spam that care... ;-)
