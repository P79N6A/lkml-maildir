I'd love to see this. I agree that a fair amount of this should be
shareable with the pipe and socket code, for example. But I would call it
"virtual" instead of "fake", since there is nothing fake about the inode.  
A pipe inode is one of the most fundamental and basic things in UNIX, it's
not "fake" just because it doesn't live on a harddisk.
In fact, one thing I noticed when doing the sigfd() code is that the pipe
code doesn't take advantage of the new inode allocation layer as well as
it could. It still uses multiple allocations, doing a _separate_
allocation for the small "pipe_inode_info" instead of doing the embedding 
trick.
And that's obviously because the code was only minimally changed, because
doing the FS setup with a super-block operation to get at a specialized
allocator is more lines of code than people were willing to do when doing
the conversion.
(It's not _that_ many lines of code, but it could certainly be improved. 
Almost everybody does the same thing at inode allocation and 
de-allocation, it's just that the structure containers are different).
