The _fast_ quick fix is to maintain a per-inode list of dirty buffers
and to invalidate that list when we do a delete.  This works for
directories if we only support truncate back to zero --- it obviously
gets things wrong if we allow partial truncates of directories (but why
would anyone want to allow that?!)
This would have minimal performance implication and would also allow
fast fsync() of indirect block metadata for regular files.
