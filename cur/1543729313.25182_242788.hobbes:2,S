Hi Paulo.
kallsyms_names should only be used by kallsyms, so there
are no issue changing this interface.
That said do not put too much effort moving kode from the kernel to
kallsyms.c. kallsyms support can be deselected, and users will not
care about the little extra overhead (down in noise compared
with the symbols).
Keeping the data passed in from the build tools as simple as possible
is the better goal here. Then the kernel can implement the extra
code to optimize speed.
kallsyms parses the output of objdump as does other tools in the kernel.
Would you be willing to look into an elf-tool for the kernel?
A consistent output from an Elf-tool is preferred as replacement
for the hacking needed to use output from objdump and nm.
See arch/sparc/boot/btfixup as a horrid example.
objdump and nm has been optimised for human readable output,
and is not easy to parse up for various tricky usage.
Rusty Russell's module-init-tools has some good starting stuff.
PS. Please cc: me on future patches in this area - thanks.
