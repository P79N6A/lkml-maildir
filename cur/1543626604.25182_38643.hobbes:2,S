How about doing:
asmlinkage void preempt_schedule(void)
{
	unsigned long saved_state;
	if (unlikely(preempt_get_count()))
		return;
	preempt_disable(); /* or use an atomic operation */
	saved_state = current->state;
	current->state = TASK_RUNNING;
	preempt_enable_no_resched(); /* we are scheduling anyway... */
	schedule();
	current->state = saved_state;
}
It is unlikely to get preemption between schedule() and the
setting since schedule it self checks - the window is small.
And when it hits if will correctly restore the correct value.
Note this code does not need to solve the FLAG problem.
	 current->state |= FLAG
	* PREEMPT *
		current->state |= FLAG
		schedule()
		current->state &= ~FLAG
	schedule() with flag disabled
