Why is the kernel lock held around sync_supers() and sync_inodes() in
sync_old_buffers() and fsync_dev(), but not in sync_dev()?  Is it just
to serialize calls to these functions, or is there some other reason?
Since this use of the BKL is one of the causes of high preemption
latency in a preemptible kernel, I'm hoping it would be OK to replace
them with a semaphore.  Please let me know if this is not the case.
Thanks!
