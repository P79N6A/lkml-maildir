First of all a big THANKS!
Now, at least, I understood the real problem...
'errno' is only needed because open(), close(), llseek() and read() are used, 
which do a syscall and the return code is written to a variable called 
'errno'. This is NOT the 'errno' variable defined in lib/errno.c... OK.
And so the real problem is using these functions and as we ARE in the kernel 
mode we do not really need the kernel traps...
So after realizing the real problem I think I am not the right person to fix 
it. But if you want I could try...
Sincerely yours
