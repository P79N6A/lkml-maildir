you need benchmarks to tell that pure per-IRQ stacks are bad for SMP
performance?
per-IRQ+per-CPU and pure per-CPU IRQ stacks should perform rougly equally
well on SMP - with per-CPU IRQ stacks having lower runtime setup cost.

there's a difference between bouncing 1-2 cachelines and bouncing a *full,
dirtied stack*. The irq_desc[] bouncing is pretty much unavoidable (IRQs
do need some global state) - the stack bouncing is just plain stupid and
perfectly avoidable.
