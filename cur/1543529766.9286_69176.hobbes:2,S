If I understand correctly, the netfilter code currently in 2.3 kernels
is being merged into the mainline and netfilter will be in standard
2.4 kernels.
What about the advanced routing patches, currently marked experimental
I think. Will they become part of the standard 2.4? Or remain patches?
Or is some other development going to make them obsolete?
For that matter, what about IPv6 and the FreeS/WAN IPSEC code? Any
plans to merge those into the mainstream?
