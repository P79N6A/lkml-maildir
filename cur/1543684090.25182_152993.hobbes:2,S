as default, the power-management of es1968 is enabled only on a
certain board, namely,
	ESS1978 _and_ (vendor == 0x1028 || vendor == 0x1179)
first, please check whether your pci id matches with it.
the behavior can be changed by a module option, use_pm, but it's
missing in the kernel boot parameter (i'll fix this later).
in that case, modify use_pm[] default value from 2 to 1, to force to
use power-management.
