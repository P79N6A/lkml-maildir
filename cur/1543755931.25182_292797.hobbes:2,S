You'll need to rally them to speak up or this is going nowhere.  We
can't afford to spend engineering dollars one unhappy person at a time
to try and get you happy.  We need concensus.

Yup, seems reasonable.

Yeah, that's insane, CVS just isn't up to the task.  We know, we import
history from CVS to BitKeeper all the time and it is very painful.  We
probably understand the impedence mismatch better than anyone and it is
large.

First, you have to remember that BK is capturing 96% of the deltas made
to files.  Some of those deltas get clumped into one CVS commit because
of the flattening of the graph structure.  If each delta had the
changeset key for the BK changeset to which it belonged you could 
split the coarse commit into the sub patches which happened on the
collapsed branch.  You wouldn't get 100% of the information but you'd
have 96% of it in a way that could be used for debugging, which is what
I suspect you are after.  
If that's not good enough then I'm not sure there is much point in
continuing the conversation.
