  I have a BitSurfr PC internal adapter now.  I had a BitSurfr Pro
external.  Does anyone have any HOWTO's or configuration informations
in English?  Best I can find are German which doesn't help me a whole
lot.
  I can now see a new serial port (ttyS02) reported by the kernel.  When
I try to access it with minicom though it doesn't seem to answer to AT
commands.
  My external, I just noticed is installed on a 16550A uart.  Shouldn't
I be able to get the full 128K?  I never seem to get over 115.  My
pppd script used to have 115200 in the cmd line.  Is that correct?
  Help?
Robert
