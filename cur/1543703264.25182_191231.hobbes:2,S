the modules themselves aren't making sysfs entries and lm_sensors is 
integrated with the kernel. so i tried sensors just in case and didn't 
realize it would output messages into the message log and not terminal. 
   In any case, i was simply wondering if the kernel's lm_sensors was 
outdated or if i was running into a compilation or configuration problem 
brought on by any recent changes.   It would appear though that the 
sensors in the kernel are incompatible with the kernel, at least some of 
them.
