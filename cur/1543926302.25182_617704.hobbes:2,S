Where do I find these patches to test?  I know where to find the stable 
releases, but not the "stable queue".
Documentation/stable_kernel_rules.txt just says there _is_ a stable queue, not 
where to access it.  Google's first hit for "linux stable queue" was
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/chrisw/stable-queue.git;a=shortlog
 
which apparently stopped updating in march...
Happy to test the patch you mentioned, if I can figure out where to find it...
Thanks,
Rob
