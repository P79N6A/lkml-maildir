There are quite a few of these about.  the MP specs have a whole section 
devoted to the seven MPC default types (2 CPU SMP machines with no BIOS 
interrupt information).  I have one under my desk at the moment (a type 2).  
Of all these types, 5 (ISA+PCI) is given the least attention in the spec, 
presumably because Intel didn't really expect anyone building something as 
expensive as an SMP board would use such a cheap and cruddy bus as ISA.
MPC default boards are usually in older machines, but still must be supported.

The problem is that a non-existent I/O port doesn't produce a defined value on 
a read.  The value will usually float to the pull resistors, but may give 
random bits on iffy boards.  There is too little sanity information in the 
ELCR to make a reliable determination of whether you have a bogus value or not.
However, this is open source; code this solution and see how it behaves on 
other MPC type 5 boards. I'd suggest using the clock IRQ trigger bit as sanity 
(it must be edge in all configurations).
