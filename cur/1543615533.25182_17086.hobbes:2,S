At least MCA and NuBus can be autodetected, and I'm fairly confident
the people behind the VME-bus and TurboChannel weren't stupid either,
so those can probably be autodetected and probed too.
Dunno about VLB, but AGP is sort of a special-case of PCI (if I'm
not all wrong) and can be autodtected too.
ISA, on the other hand, is always a gamble. I bet there are other
exceptions as well.
