Both of my NICs are running in 2.4.25. What I found out is that the Rhine
that sets to be "100 full duplex" doesn't send the advertisement correctly.
I made a fix to set the advertisement register accordingly and then to turn
on the autonegotiation bit. It worked for Via Rhine III.
It seems other NIC, like e100(Intel Pro 100M), has similiar issue. However,
the similiar fix doesn't work for it.
I don't have 2.6.10-rc installed so that I don't know. But I looked at the
patch related to via-rhine.c. It doesn't look like it has been fixed.
