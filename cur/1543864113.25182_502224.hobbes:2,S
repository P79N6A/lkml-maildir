Are you now arguing that "rmmod $DRIVER" doesn't suffice for what you
were wanting to do?  If so, why?  What's the delta in power usage?

Specifically to support driver testing.  Recall that such testing was
at that time the only known quasi-viable use of that interface.  (And
despite your pushback, it still seems that way to me...)
I've changed my mind about that; it's just as easy to whip up custom test
logic, and in any case the stuff that I most needed to test (wakeup
events) can't be tested like that.  Bad testing infrastructure doesn't
really do anyone favors, anyway; too much time spent with workarounds,
many of which cover up the bugs you're trying to uncover by testing.
