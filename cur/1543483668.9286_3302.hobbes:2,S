Hi, dont know if this is relevent, sorry about the lack of information.
Up until today I have NEVER had linux crash on me in "normal" operation.
Day before yesterday I installed 2.2.1
Today, after running some tasks in x-windows (accelerated X server +
enlightenment dr0.15) the keyboard froze.
But was still able to use the system via mouse.
logged onto the box via telnet from my windoze machine. was able to 
play about fine.
Killed the x-server expected to see the screen return to text console.
Instead the system console froze in graphic mode with the mouse cursor
also frozen.
I have had the xserver freeze before in such a state that the machine was
unable to respond via anything other than network.
This time, I did a shutdown -r now from the telnet session and expected
the system to reboot... rebooted aok, but on load of kernel only got as
far as "loading linux..........." then froze.
did a cool boot (reset switch on front of PC) and system rebooted again,
this time got a CRC error on unpack of kernel.
Finally! tried to cycle the power, and the machine came up fine...
Any comments? Sorry again about the lack of details, but I havent got
many. Will take sugestions about what to look out for if it happens again.
Regards, Pete.
