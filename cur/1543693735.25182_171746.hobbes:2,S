Hm, I think so. I never had problems with the signal quality
and it looks quite good.
The whole thing works with linux-2.4 and it worked with 2.6-test1.
As far as I remember the trouble started with test2. (I posted
to lkml after I first saw the trouble. The
crashes disappeared now, but the messages are still there.)

I disabled CONFIG_PREMPT and it still throws these messages.
