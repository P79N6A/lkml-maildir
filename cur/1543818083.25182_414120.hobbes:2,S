RFC 3927 specifies the Ethernet arp broadcast behavior for only 
169.254.0.0/16.  Presumably you could set the scope parameter to local 
for addresses outside of that range or even for protocols other than 
Ethernet.  Since broadcasting ARP packets usually adversely effects 
usable network bandwidth, we should probably only do it where it is 
absolutely required.  The overhead of testing the value required by the 
RFC is quite low (3 machine instructions on i686 is the size of the 
entire patch), so using some proxy like the scope parameter would not 
even be a performance win.
