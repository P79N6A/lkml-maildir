I'm running Slackware 4.0 on a 18Gb SCSI Disk. The machine went down and I
found these errors in the syslog file. I ran fsck -f /dev/sda3 but it
didn't find any errors. I also upgraded the kernel from 2.2.10 to 2.2.14
and everything seems to be ok now. But I really need to know what this
means. Does anyone know?
