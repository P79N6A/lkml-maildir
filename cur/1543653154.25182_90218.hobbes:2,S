Hi!
For S3 wakeup I need identity mappning. There's
acpi_create_identity_pmd(), but its broken: it only creates 4MB worth
on mappings, and you get really *nasty to debug* crashes if you enable
enough options in your kernel.
Question is how to fix it nicely.
I thought about killing zap_low_mappings and then reusing
swapper_pg_dir for that purpose. Is there some problem with that?
