Hmm...
I can code it up and we can see what it looks like.
Unfortunately the __migrate_task() check won't go away: someone may
have asked to move from CPU 0 to 1, and by the time migration thread
on 0 gets to the request, 1 has gone down.  We don't want all the
callers to hold the cpucontrol lock, because now the NUMA scheduler
uses migration as a common case 8(
Thanks,
Rusty.
