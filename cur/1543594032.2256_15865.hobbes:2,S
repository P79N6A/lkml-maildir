I got just the YUV code from Gatos, and a few months ago it took less than
an hour to merge just that part (and most of that was compiling and
testing).
The rest of Gatos is obviously more experimental, but the YUV code looks
quite sane.

Yes. Although I hope it's going to be XvMPG2 or something - some cards
literally do all of the mpeg2 stuff, not just parts of it, and limiting
yourself to just the motion comp is limiting the protocol quite badly.
