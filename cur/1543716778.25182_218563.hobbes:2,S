Opposite opinion here.
If you want 100% reliability you shouldn't use -mm in the first place.
Making 4kb stacks default in -mm is very good idea so it will get necessary
testing and fixing before being integrated into mainline.
Please also note that users of binary only modules always have choice:
- new kernels without binary only modules
- old kernels with binary only modules
It is really that simple.
