Are you doing this with INTx left on or turned off? Have you determined 
whether turning off INTx does anything useful on these devices when you're 
not using MSI? (There are only a few places in the kernel which disable 
INTx, mostly associated with enabling MSI.)
It might be easier to test if you boot off a USB storage device of some 
sort.
