This series gets mainline buildable on m68k; most of these patches apply clean
to m68k CVS as well, except for two that are pulled from m68k CVS.  Usual
mix of compile fixes, fixes of gcc4-detected crap and sparse annotations.
Compared to the last time this series had been posted: fix for breakage of
console code in head.S in absense of FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE changed as Roman
had suggested.
