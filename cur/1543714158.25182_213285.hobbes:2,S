Thanks, I did not know it.

When looking for the evdev modul, I found the event debug (evbug) modul, so I 
used that one instead. It writes event debug info to the kernel log. I loaded 
it, and started pressing the mouse buttons, one after another.
Everything looks OK: there are no superfluous mouse events. This is the
output I got:

So the mouse event regeneration in the kernel seems to be buggy.

Yes. In order to use the mouse buttons on the side, one has to use the
configuration above. Obviously the Z axis is mapped to the wrong buttons 
(and button 4 and 5 are the side buttons..) so buttons should be swapped 
in X with the   xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 6 7 4 5"   command.
