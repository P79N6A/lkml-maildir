It doesn't work for anything but old legacy floppies.  I have already
sent the code to Alan for 2.5-ac and to Andi for x86-64 (where it has
already been integrated); if anyone wants to try to persuade Marcelo to
integrate it, be my guest, the current patch is at:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/nobootsect-2.5.63-bk7-1.diff
It's already enough work to keep this patch up to date and trying to get
Linus to take it.
