Thanks Urban, that did it.
I however  observe  the  following:  when  using  the  patched  2.4.25
module,  a  "ls  /dosc" (where /dosc is the dir I mount the shared C:
drive  of  a  WIN98  box  into)  sometimes shows a noticeable delay. I
suspect it is when the patched code does a retry. E.g.:
# time ls /dosc >/dev/null
0.000u 0.000s 0:00.20 0.0%      0+0k 0+0io 157pf+0w
(noticeable delay)
# time ls /dosc > /dev/null
0.000u 0.010s 0:00.00 0.0%      0+0k 0+0io 157pf+0w
(normal)
# time ls /dosc > /dev/null
0.010u 0.000s 0:00.80 1.2%      0+0k 0+0io 157pf+0w
(even more noticeable delay)
This happens at most 1 time out of 5, so the sample above
doesn't match reality.
If I load the module build from 2.4.24 sources instead:
# umount /dosc
# rmmod smbfs
# insmod ../smbfs.2.4.24/smbfs.o
# /usr/local/samba/bin/smbmount //w98box/c /dosc -o password=xxxxx
this delay goes away:
# time ls /dosc > /dev/null
0.000u 0.000s 0:00.00 0.0%      0+0k 0+0io 157pf+0w
(normal, consistently)
Not  a  big deal probably, and I'm not sure that kernel developers are
that  much motivated to work around bugs in Win9x, but somehow I think
that the 2.4.24 smbfs code didn't trigger this bug at all, whereas the
new  code  does  trigger  it  and  thus  needs  these delayed retries.
Looking   at   the   code   of   both   versions,   it   seems    that
smb_proc_getattr_95()  (where  the  patch  you've  posted  lies)  uses
smb_proc_getattr_trans2_std()  whereas  the   old   code   seemed   to
completely avoid it in the W95 code path:
From 2.4.24's ./fs/smbfs/proc.c:
========================================================================
        /*
         * Select whether to use core or trans2 getattr.
         * Win 95 appears to break with the trans2 getattr.
         */
        if (server->opt.protocol < SMB_PROTOCOL_LANMAN2 ||
            (server->mnt->flags & (SMB_MOUNT_OLDATTR|SMB_MOUNT_WIN95)) ) {  
                result = smb_proc_getattr_core(server, dir, fattr);
        } else {
                if (server->mnt->flags & SMB_MOUNT_DIRATTR)
                        result = smb_proc_getattr_ff(server, dir, fattr);
                else
                        result = smb_proc_getattr_trans2(server, dir, fattr);
        }
========================================================================
Am I completely off track here?
Greets,
_Alain_
