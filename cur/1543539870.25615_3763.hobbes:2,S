Such as? (Bearing in mind this should void the warranty...)

Not the case. I said there are ways to avoid the need to reboot on
mission-critical systems.

There are reasons to filter these commands out under normal circumstances,
as Andre has explained. There are also probably exceptional circumstances
where you would want/need to bypass this - for a repair/diagnostics disk,
for example.

It's not a case of talking "extensions", just a matter of preventing
access to the vendor-specific commands which potentially void the
warranty.
Anyway, Andre has now rendered this argument academic: the drive should
now enforce these limits, logging any violations in case of later warranty
claim. A much better solution, I must admit.
