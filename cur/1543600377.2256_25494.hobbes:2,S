The same IP address with different netmasks on the same hardware
interface? The mind boggles. How does one handle broadcasts?

The issue is not MTA loop detection.
Postfix uses the local netmask info to distinguish between local
and remote networks. At the discretion of the sysadmin, systems on
local subnets can be granted different rights than random systems
on the Internet.
If Linux insists on breaking SIOCGIFCONF then so be it, even though
it works perfectly well on any non-Linux system that I could lay
my hands on.
