Yes, there will be a future for this driver and the other missing
drivers. I have choosed to delete drivers that we haven't ported yet
because otherwise people assume that they work. I will try to
port the USB host driver and the other missing drivers from 2.4 as 
soon as possible.

Is there going to be a future update for this, or have you all dropped
USB support for CRIS?
