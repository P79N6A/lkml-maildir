Yep, the GPLv3 probably will release around July time. So;luckily, we 
had very little time to see the final decision about it :-) I hope we 
should upgrade to GPLv3 and Sun should "Dual License" the OpenSolaris 
via GPLv3 (or at least,GPLv3 should be CDDL compatible.). So,we should 
have more fruits (like ZFS,DTrace etc.) ;-)
