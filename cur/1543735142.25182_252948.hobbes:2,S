Yes, and does it not save the whole CPU context and restore it, or tell
the compiler that certain registers which you don't preserve are
clobbered?  If it didn't, I think you'd find that you have a bug
there.
The scheduler quite rightly expects, for any thread, that any variable
which may be stored in a CPU register before the context switch has the
same value as after the context switch.
(note - "preserve" above - I don't mean from one thread to another,
I mean preserved within the context of one thread.)
