 This indicates it's even less standard than I suspected -- in the 286 and
386 days 0x9 used only to pop registers off the stack in a predefined way
and then execute retf.  If you want to perform some initialization then
0x5 performs exactly what 0xa does but additionally it resets the 8259s to
PC defaults.

 I meant the memory got clobbered before -- as the reason or the result of
kernel crash.

 One might try to recover the running kernel from a triple-fault but I
wouldn't dare performing any execution but creating a crash log
afterwards.

 There might be a "well-known" BIOS entry point which could help here.  I
don't have the list of BIOS entry points handy but BIOS developers still
seem to keep compatible with the IBM's original.
