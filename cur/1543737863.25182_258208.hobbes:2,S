  Well, I down loaded and installed RedHat-9 5 weeks ago, and it
  is a 2.4 kernel, so I thought that would be fine.
  (See what a novice I am?)

  This is a driver for talking to my hardware which is a PCI bus card.
  This card has 5 large FPGAs, SRAM and dram on it which is used to
  accelerate bioinformatics search algorithms.
  The card works under Sun Solaris and Windows/2000, and of course,
  we would like to add Linux to the list.
  Eventually, I'll need to support DMA to and from the card, but
  I can get by for a while just doing single-dword I/O.
  I just hacked in dev->bus->ops->read_dword(dev,1,&retval);
  and I can read memory on the card! (Well, things don't crash anyway)
  If this is absolutely the wrong way to do this, please let me know!
  Note: I have no idea what the second parameter to read_dword() is!
