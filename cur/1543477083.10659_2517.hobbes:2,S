A correct compiler could not skip passing this, because it can not be known
until link time that this will not be needed.  I don't know of a compiler 
that leaves enough info in the .o file for the linker to optimize at that 
stage...and ld.so would never take the time to do so.

Amen...and it's not like you have occasion to do so all that often.
