Similar with device-mapper: in normal usage dm only sees major:minor.
Yes, the filp dm passes along is incorrect:
- return blkdev_driver_ioctl(bdev->bd_inode, filp, bdev->bd_disk, cmd, arg);
+ return blkdev_driver_ioctl(bdev->bd_inode, NULL, bdev->bd_disk, cmd, arg);
But should unlocked_ioctl become ?
- long (*unlocked_ioctl) (struct file *, unsigned, unsigned long);
+ long (*unlocked_ioctl) (struct inode *, struct file *, unsigned, unsigned long);
so it can be used for block devices?
See also block/scsi_ioctl.c:201 verify_command()  [scsi_cmd_ioctl]
         * file can be NULL from ioctl_by_bdev()...
Or should we be working towards eliminating interfaces that use device numbers?
