You misunderstood me:
AFAICS slab.c has 2 weaks spots:
* cache hit rates are ignored on UP, and for objects > PAGE_SIZE on both 
SMP and UP.
* freeable pages are not returned efficiently to page_alloc.c, neither 
on SMP nor on UP. On SMP, this is a big problems, because the 
cache_chain_semaphore is overloaded.
I just wanted to say that a hotlist in page_alloc.c is not able to 
replace a hotlist in slab.c, because many objects are smaller than page 
size. Both lists are needed.
