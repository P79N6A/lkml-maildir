Yup!  IMHO her work is pretty much the solution to the problem.
OK I'm a little biased here, because she just started as faculty
at my school, but I was saying this to the faculty here even
before she applied.

In short she uses Hidden Markov models to classify access patterns
with a file.  I'm using Markov models to track access across files.
