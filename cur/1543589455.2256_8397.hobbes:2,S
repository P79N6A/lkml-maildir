here the fix for your module race (still untested though):

For the large-vmalloc races I'd take a very lazy approch:

I mean: I certainly don't need it, not even on the 256G boxes, the non
LARGE_VMALLOC is simpler and _faster_ (it drops a branch from the page
fault handler fast path) and so I'd prefer to spend my time on other
things than fixing LARGE_VMALLOC races, but still the above will avoid
people to get bitten by such race until somebody fixes it.  If anybody
has a rasonable example for which I may need more than 8giga of kernel
vmalloc memory then I can change my mind of course.
