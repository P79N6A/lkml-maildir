Why is that and where can I get documentation on the ip
program?
  Specifically I have a problem where I seem to need to
set a src addr on a route which means I need to use ip rather
than route, but I also need a metric. "ip" seems to call
that "weight" but how do I set it? And why doesn't "ip route"
show any weights/metrics even though "netstat -rne" does?
