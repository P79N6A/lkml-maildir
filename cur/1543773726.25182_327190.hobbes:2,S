Please refer to the comment in the description:
schedule_timeout(1) is ambiguous in older/unchanged code since 2.4, as
it indicated a 10 millisecond sleep then. Now, in 2.6, it indicates a 1
millisecond sleep (HZ==1000). I am trying to prevent issues like this
coming up in the future (CONFIG_HZ has hit -mm, e.g.) and msleep() is a
good way to do so.
If you are trying to sleep for the shortest amount of time possible (a
tick), though, then the code is fine, I guess. A comment may be useful,
though.
Thanks,
Nish
