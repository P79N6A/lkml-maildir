I think that function pointers are a good idea too.  But I'm not sure 
why that should hold up this patch.  As it stands now all ppc64 
platforms that do hotplug happen to be pSeries.  I don't know of any 
other ppc64 platforms that are not pSeries who plan on doing this in the 
next few years.  The function is already pSeries specific anyway with 
the rtas_stop_self call.
Meanwhile if we do not put this patch in all Power5 machines will be 
unable to do cpu hotplug with a mainline kernel.
