Thanks for the feedback.
I'm working on fixing the concerns Andrew Morton expressed regarding
memory leaks in the open function. I'll send an updated driver soon.
BTW - Jeremy suggested that the number of EPs to configure should be
determined from the device ID. Makes sense to me, but then many users
may have no use for the additional EPs. Alternatively, Greg suggested
that maybe this should split into 2 drivers. Any preferences, anyone?
I don't know which of these devices present multiple EPs though. Can you
send me the appropriate section from 'cat /proc/bus/usb/devices'?
Anyone with an actual Airprime (ID 0xf3d, 0x0112) or Novatel Merlin
(0x1410, 0x1110) please do the same.
Thanks -
Andy
