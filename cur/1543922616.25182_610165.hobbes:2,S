hrm, could be.  It would be strange for that to happen quietly with fuzz=1
and to still produce a compileable result.
But there weren't any patches in this git-merge which weren't in 2.6.23-mm1
so maybe something like that happened.  Or maybe that fact that this pull
only contained _some_ of the ext4 patches which were in -mm somehow affected
things.
Oh well, I should have sent the ext4 changes via Ted anyway.
