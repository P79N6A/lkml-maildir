More than likely its a problem with how I'm using it but here goes:
I am running the 2.2.1 kernel.  I was trying to compile linux-threads
0.71, and it gives me a bunch of warnings and quits.  The warnings are
generated when it includes <asm/semaphore.h> ..  I know a *LITTLE* C but
not that much... so I thought I'd ask.
Warning #1: semaphore.h line 134 - struct task_struct declared inside
parameter list
Warning #2: semaphore.h line 141 - PAGE_MASK undeclared
I'm using gcc version 2.8.1 and the compiler flags when compiling are
'-pipe -O2 -Wall'
I added:
#include <asm/page.h>
into the beginning of the semaphore.h file, and linuxthreads compiled
fine (except for the multitude of errors regarding struct task_struct)
