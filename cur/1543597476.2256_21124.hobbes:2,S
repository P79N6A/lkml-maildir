You are correct.  It is trivial to allow only the 'target' CPU to reset
the cpus_allowed field.  This was my first thought.  However, as you
state below we would get into trouble if there was an extremely long
delay in that CPU running schedule.
The timestamp sounds reasonable, but I was trying to keep it as simple
as possible.
