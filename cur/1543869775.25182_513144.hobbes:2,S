Linus, you made your point clearly - generic AIO should not be used for
the cases, when it is supposed to block 90% of the time - only when it
almost never blocks, like in case of buffered IO.
Otherwise, when load nature requires almost always to block, we would
see that each block is eventually removed - by something, which calls
wake_up(), that something is an event, which we were supposed to wait,
but instead we we resceduled and waited there, so we just added
additional layer of dereferencing - we were scehduled away, did some
work, then awakened, instead of doing some work and get event.
I do not even discuss, that micro-threading model is way tooo simpler to
programm, but from above example is clear that it adds additional
overhead, which in turn can be high or noticeble.

I can only say that I'm fully agree. Absolutely. No jokes.

Hmmm... let me describe that process a bit:
Userspace wants to open a file, so it needs some file-related (inode,
direntry and others) structures in the mem, they should be read from
disk. Eventually it will be reading some blocks from the disk 
(for example ext3_lookup->ext3_find_entry->ext3_getblk/ll_rw_block) and
we will wait for them (wait_on_bit()) - we will wait for event.
But I agree, it was a brainfscking example, but nevertheless, it can be
easily done using event driven model.
Reading from the disk is _exactly_ the same - the same waiting for
buffer_heads/pages, and (since it is bigger) it can be easily
transferred to event driven model.
Ugh, wait, it not only _can_ be transferred, it is already done in
kevent AIO, and it shows faster speeds (though I only tested sending
them over the net).

Event is data readiness - no more, no less.
It has nothing with internal kernel structures - you just wait until
data is ready in requested buffer (disk, net, whatever).
Internal mechanism of moving data to the destination point can use event
driven model too, but it is another question.
Eventually threads wait for the same events - but there is an additional
overhead created to manage that objects called threads.
Ingo says that it is fast to manage them, but it can not be faster than
properly created event driven abstraction, because, as you noticed
himself, mutual transformations are complex.
Threadlets are simpler to program, but they do not add a gain compared
to properly created singlethreaded model (or number of CPU-threadede
model) with the right event processing mechanims.
Waiting for any IO is a waiting for event, other tasks can be made an
event too, but I agree, it is simpler to use different models just
because they already exist.

Let me rephrase that stuff:
the thing people want to remove with linked lists is the internal
overhead of maintaing special-purpose code like RB trees.
It sounds with similar part of idiocity in it.
If additional code provides faster processing, it must be used instead of
fear of 'the internal overhead of maintaining special-purpose code'.
