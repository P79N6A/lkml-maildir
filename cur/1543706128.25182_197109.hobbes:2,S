Hi, 
Posted the below to the newbie list got no response. Any help would be appriciated.
Also wanted to add that /proc/ksyms seemed to have all the symbols required.
Thanks,
Vishwas

Hi folks,
I had built and inserted my kernel module, I wanted to debug and I made some changes. Now after removing the old module I am not able to insert the new module at all.
I am inserting the module in the development machine itself so no version mismatches. I tried adding and removing other modules and that works fine. 
The below seem to be all the symbols I am using in my module. Any hint what I may have accidently removed or deleted or what I am missing would be helpful.
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol pci_write_config_byte
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol __generic_copy_from_user
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol kmalloc
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol unregister_chrdev
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol register_chrdev
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol pci_read_config_byte
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol pcibios_present
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol pci_read_config_dword
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol __ioremap
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol pci_read_config_word
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol kfree
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol pci_write_config_dword
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol pci_find_device
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol pci_write_config_word
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol printk
krn_mod.o: unresolved symbol __generic_copy_to_user
Thanks,
Vishwas
