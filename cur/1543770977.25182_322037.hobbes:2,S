Well I remember the first time I saw devfs running, I thought "Wow
finally I have a way to find the disc that is scsi id 3 on controller 0
even if I add a device at id 2 after setting up the system", something
most unix systems have always had, but linux made hard (you had to
somehow figure out which id mapped to which /dev/sd* entry, which from a
users perspective wasn't trivial, and of course keeping your fstab in
sync with the mapping was a pain).
I think sysfs can do it too, although I haven't looked to much at sysfs
yet.
For IDE devices the /dev entry always mapped to a specific device
(modulo your ide drivers loading in a consistant order, but scsi host
controller load order has the same issue).  Scsi just assigned /dev
entries in the order devices were discovered.  In some ways it is handy
to know your first scsi drive is sda if you are doing raid1 or something
and a drive dies, but on the other hand it is annoying that drives move
around if you add drives with a lower id than your existing drives.
Having both would be preferable.
I don't know if the ide or scsi method is currently more sane, but it
sure would be nice to have a consistent behaviour between the two.
