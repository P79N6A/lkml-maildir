I've found myself drifting to and from favouring the 80 cols limit in my own 
code. It's a good way of forcing yourself to refactor, which usually works 
out nicely, and I've even managed to write Java that was mostly 80 cols 
(which is a far bigger challenge than C due to the required preceding tab 
depth for a method inside a class..)

This is usually for multiple levels of dereferencing, and it really does help 
readability.

It's fairly redundant trying to answer this question without the opinion of 
the people that really matter. I'd hazard a guess and say that if you ranked 
kernel contributors by man-hours spent on the kernel, the top ten would all 
think the 80 columns rule was critically important.
