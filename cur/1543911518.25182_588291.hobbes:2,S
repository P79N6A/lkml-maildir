Subject: [PATCH RT 3/3] fix get_monotonic_cycles for latency tracer
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/24/277

The latency tracer on SMP was given crazy results. It was found that the
get_monotonic_cycles that it uses was not returning a monotonic counter.
The cause of this was that clock->cycles_raw and clock->cycles_last can
be updated on another CPU and make the cycles_now variable out-of-date.
So the delta that was calculated from cycles_now - cycles_last was
incorrect.
This patch adds a loop to make sure that the cycles_raw and cycles_last
are consistent through out the calculation (otherwise it performs the
loop again).
With this patch the latency_tracer can produce normal results again.
