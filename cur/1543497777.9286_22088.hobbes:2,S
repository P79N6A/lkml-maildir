Subject: [RFC] [PATCH] arch/i386 bootcode rewrite
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Apologies on the previously attached mime encoded patch; I hadn't realized
I sent it out encoded. It's a tad too large to attach here, so I've put
it up at:

Now here comes the RFC:
I am now aware that the latest gas supports intel syntax (via the
.intel_syntax directive) but the bootcode is still heavily biased toward
as86. I really would much rather have the bootcode rewritten in AT&T
(which is what this patch did) since the work is already done and because
there isn't a single other place in the kernel that intel syntax is used
(I dig consistency).
I could simply go back and clean up the bootcode so that it compiles with
gas and .intel_syntax, but that just seems like a waste of time.
Martin, I still haven't heard back from you on whether or not this whole
idea is kosher with you. Let me know when you get a chance.
Other comments? Concerns?
