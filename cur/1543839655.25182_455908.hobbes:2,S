I'm afraid that most don't change the default, not being aware that this
is an unreasonable security risk.

I can do that, but:
- it almost defeats the purpose of the patch since most people won't
know to change the defaults;
- Marcelo is of the opinion that it's "not 2.4 material at this point in
time".
Given the above, do you still want me to resubmit a reworked patch like
that?

I submit these patches in hope that they will be useful for mainstream
kernels, not in an attempt to simplify maintenance of -ow patches.
