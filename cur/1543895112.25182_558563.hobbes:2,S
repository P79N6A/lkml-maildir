See, you can't even keep the FSF's "Free Software Definition" and its 
inherent "religion" out of the discussion. Sure, the FSF can claim that the 
GPL is intended as a way to "defend" the "Four Freedoms" defined *BY* *THEM*, 
but unless alluded to in the license, the only bearing it can have, anywhere, 
is on the "intent" of the license, as seen by the FSF. And if the "ability to 
run a "covered work" on any piece of hardware" is "freedom 0" then binary 
distribution is in violation of the "spirit" - I can't run an x86 binary on a 
PPC. Isn't that a "designed in hardware restriction" that violates 
the "spirit" of the license ?

Not in the least. They still have to release their changes if they want to 
sell their devices. Or are you so blinded by your belief that the FSF and RMS 
can't be wrong that you can't understand that?

It is only *YOUR* opinion that the GPLv3 is the better license. As Linus has 
explained, he doesn't share your viewpoint.

No, it reduces their motivation to improve the software on *those* devices. If 
they like the software enough to actually download the source, they probably 
also liked it enough to install it on their computer *AND* will modify it to 
make it work better on their computer.

With your argument about reduced motive shotten down this portion falls apart.

Agreed. The disagreement is about what that spirit is. I feel that its spirit 
is in the free and open exchange of ideas, as personified by the software 
people write. I *ALSO* feel that it's spirit lies in the phrase "do whatever 
you want with the software as long - but if you add your own ideas to it, 
give them back to the people like your inspiration was given to you."
You,  the FSF and, apparently, RMS, feel it is about the "Four Freedoms" as 
defined by RMS. I'm quite sure that my view is much more common among the 
people that *DON'T* think that the FSF and RMS are never wrong.

Again, that is *your* version of the "spirit".

I agree to the "can't enjoy or test" bits. But I don't believe that it reduces 
anything. Personally I feel that anything that exposes people to "Free 
Software" is a *BONUS*.

Yes. Because a number of your "facts" are massively flawed. Now, please, 
you've proven to me that you can't, in fact, do any *objective* thinking 
about this topic.
When you are ready to drop your pre-conceptions and think *objectively* about 
the topic, come back and talk. Until then, go away.
