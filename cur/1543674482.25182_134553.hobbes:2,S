That's incorrect. Page replacement policy at the user-level was
proposed but AIUI not included in Mach. You're thinking of external
pagers, which are grossly inefficient but have only to do with the
I/O to fetch and store pages belonging to a memory object, not with
page replacement. Mach's page replacement policy was global SEGQ.
This is specifically discussed by Vahalia.
