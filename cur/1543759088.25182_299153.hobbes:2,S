I think the sort of sell-your-cycles service which this patch enables is a
neat idea, and one which is worth supporting, especially as the kernel
patch is so tiny.  So we want as many machines as possible to support it. 
So people don't need a special kernel just to join in.
Others may disagree, although nobody has.
And the patch is tiny.
