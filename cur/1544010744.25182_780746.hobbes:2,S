Hi,
anyone working on toshiba_acpi or omnibook module ?
toshiba_acpi:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-next-2.6.git;a=commit;h=c41a40c58b623f97dd2e23aa3baab2cedb47d99f
The rfkill-switch does not work. The device is disabled when switched of,
but it gets not reenabled. But the bluetooth dongle is enabled after booting.
AFAIK this only works for Toshiba manufactured devices (toshiba_acpi), not
for Compal manufactured.
Omnibook:
Omnibook module functionality for Compal manufactured lptops should still
be included in the kernel. The Compal supporting module omnibook
additionaly works on many laptops from HP, ... The omnibook-module seems to
be abandoned, the last commit is nearly two years ago.
Omnibook-module:
