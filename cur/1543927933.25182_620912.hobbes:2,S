James, 
Here is a dmesg produced by 2.6.24-rc3-mm1 + your patch "separates the 
BLOCK and QUIESCE states correctly" (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/24/8
).
How to reproduce :
- boot
- switch to a text console
- capture dmesg in a file, sync, etc. There are 3 I/O errors, but the 
  system does work.
- switch to X console, log in the Gnome Desktop, the system partially 
  hangs.
- switch back to a text console: dmesg(1) still works, it shows some 
  additonal I/O errors. At this point, any disk access makes the system 
  completely hung.
Additionnal data:
- the I/O errors always happen on the same blocks.
