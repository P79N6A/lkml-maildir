Frankly, I think the old code is much more prone to unforeseen problems
than the new.

I don't like being an enabler of bad code.  So I didn't do a separate fix
inside something that I already knew needed to be ripped out.  If you want
an untested minimal fix for just the leak potential, leaving the semantics
frotzed in multiple ways, you can try the following.
