Hello,
I'm trying to netboot some Xeon machines on a GigE network (and from a 
server) with mtu size 8k.  everything works hunky-dory until the machine 
gets its dhcp autoconguration done, at which point, even though the 
machine responds to a ping, it freezes.  If I set the mtu on the server 
back to 1500, things unfreeze, but GigE doesn't like small frame sizes, so 
that's not really an option.  Am I correct in thinking that the kernel ip 
autoconfig support doesn't set mtu sizes?  
Thanks,
Seth Lepzelter
