Git is not a SCM yet.  For the rename + change set it should internally
handle by pure rename only plus the extra delta. The current git don't
have per file change history. From git's point of view some file deleted
and the other file appeared with same content.
It is the top level SCM to handle that correctly.
Rename a directory will be even more fun.
