Amiga, Sun-3/3x and probably Q40/Q60 are working, except for some SCSI drivers.
Other subarches are in a worse shape.
In general, 2.6.0-test4 on m68k isn't that far from 2.4.22-rc3, except for some
SCSI breakage.
You can check out the status at 
http://linux-m68k-cvs.apia.dhs.org/~geert/.
The patch pages are usually up-to-date, the feature status pages aren't (e.g.
basic m68k support got fixed a few weeks ago).

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
