Hi, 
I did compile my new kernel 2.4 on a Red Hat 6.0 Linux  
system. My Linux System  was installed so that it can 
boot from a floppy.
So on the boot floppy, I have LILO (On the hard drive, 
there's also LILO). 
For booting my new kernel (/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.0), I added 
following stanza to /etc/lilo.conf (the one on the hard drive): 
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.0
label=linux2.4
root=/dev/hda2
read-only. Lilo was correctly saved. But when I rebooted the system
with the boot floppy, LILO wont display linux2.4 so that I can boot with it!
LILO would only show up the old linux. 
I when adding the same stanza (as previously mentionned) to /etc/lilo.conf
that is on the floppy. But the problem is still the same: I do not have the choice to boot with linux2.4!
Thanks
