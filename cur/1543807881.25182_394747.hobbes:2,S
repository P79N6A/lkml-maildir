Yes, I saw that.  AIUI that's mainly about binding groups of processes
to CPUs, to defeat Amdahl's law when it rears its head.  It fits into
the containers model as a hard partitioning feature, but is a lot more
crude than the CPU Token Bucket scheduler in Linux-VServer.
No doubt both CPU allocation strategies will be useful.
