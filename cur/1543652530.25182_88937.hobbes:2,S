And in some implementations the codec control labelled PCM2 is actually 
main volume, and I've seen one where a headphone was the actual main 
volume.  So, the answer is tinker with all the available volume sliders to 
see if you can find one that actually changes the volume of everything at 
once, and if you do find it, use it.
On a side note, Alan, this patch looked to be missing the record causes us 
to loose the playback channel patch that you should have.
