I just narrowed the problem to an interaction with the tpctl tools.
If I turn off /etc/init.d/tpctl (turn its sysV symlinks into K* links),
I get no DMA errors.  I can then reproduce the errors by
       /etc/init.d/tpctl start
(which runs tpctl and loads the smapi and thinkpad modules), as long as
I am in runlevel 2 or higher.  If I'm in runlevel 1, I get no errors.
I'm using Debian's tpctl package (4.17-1).  With kernel 2.6.13-rc3, I'm
using the thinkpad modules from Debian's thinkpad-source (5.8-4)
package.  With 2.6.11.4 I use the 5.8-3 package for the source, but it's
almost the same as 5.8-4.
