I'm coming to the conclusion that if there are flash chips which inherit
the Intel insanity of automatically locking themselves on every power
cycle, thus rendering the 'locked' status meaningless, we should just
automatically unlock the whole chip at boot time, from the _chip_
driver.
That way, we can remove that hack from the board drivers which are
currently doing it.

Attachments would do that, but your patches were sensibly inlined.
In fact, your mail got trapped for moderation because you did the
_right_ thing -- you sent them in a thread, with References: headers to
keep them together. But because that means you have References: and no
'Re:' in the Subject: header, that's indistinguishable from the muppets
who try to start a new thread by replying to an existing mail and
changing the subject. So it's trapped for moderation and I get to look
at it and manually approve it.
