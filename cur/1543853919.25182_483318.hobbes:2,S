The slrn newsreader is text console, so x-terminal+mouse to use X
clipboard.
If you want to bounce message, in slrn there are 2 options:
,--
|  F                  Forward the current article to someone (via email).
|        ESC 1 F        Forward the current article (including all headers).
`--
Tested, works.
Sending is difficult (for a while):
slrn converts "Cc" header to "To", when it sends copies by SMTP, and
removes it from NNTP postings. I've used "Mail-Follow-Up" header, but
now i want to patch slrn with better lkml + gmane.org support (:.
--[OT]--
slrn + gmane.org is a miracle, that enables lkml (and many others MLs)
for me.
BTW. On you web site i've read historical lkml messages, like Linus'
moving from Transmeta, and i saw, that you had news<->lkml bridge.
