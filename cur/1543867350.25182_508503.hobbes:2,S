There isn't a singular merged iwlwifi + d80211 package tree outside of 
wireless-dev, and iwlwifi isn't there yet (I'm cleaning out some dead 
and duplicated code before we submit)
I've put up 
http://intellinuxwireless.org/repos/?p=d80211.git
 so you can 
pull the d80211 package via git (vs. downloading the tarball).  Running 
'make patch_kernel' will then install the d80211 subsystem containing 
patches not yet in wireless-dev into your kernel sources (specified via 
KSRC=)
