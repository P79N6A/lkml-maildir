The other day I finally got a 2.5 kernel (2.5.13) to compile and boot.
One of the major stumbling (crashing) blocks seems to be DEVFS, so I
simply disabled it and booted the kernel.
The system appears to have come up completely now, except for the
keyboard which is totally frozen throughout the entire boot process.
I don't have another PC but I might try and get my Psion Series 5
to act as a VT100 terminal and go in through serial.
The keyboard is a bog-standard AT 102 keyboard, attached through a
AT/PS2 converter to an ABIT KT133 ATX motherboard.. no USB stuff.
Keyboard is turned on in the input devices option in kernel config.
But it's utterly dead: even ALT-SYSRQ-B.  Is this normal?
