Hmm...that would be a significant change, and I'm not clear that the
existing security_task_alloc() hook even allows for it (no clone_flags
passed to it).  ptrace_sid could also be an issue for sharing.
Note that the mm checking logic is already after one permission check
(setcurrent), which will only be allowed to the small set of privileged
processes that use this feature.  That acts as the gatekeeper for any
use of this feature, then the dyntransition check controls the possible
transitions among security contexts using this feature.  In the case of
exec-based transitions, the corresponding transition check is deferred
until the actual exec processing.  So even as it stands, arbitrary
processes aren't allowed to reach the code in question, which is better
than the [gs]etpriority cases.
