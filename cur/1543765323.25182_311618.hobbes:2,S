Hey, anybody who wants to argue that BK is getter than GIT won't be 
getting any counter-arguments from me.
The fact is, I have constraints. Like needing something to work within a
few days. If somebody comes up with a ultra-fast, replicatable, space
efficient SCM in three days, I'm all over it. 
In the meantime, I'd suggest people who worry about network bandwidth try 
to work out a synchronization protocol that allows you to send "diff 
updates" between git repositories. The git model doesn't preclude looking 
at the objects and sending diffs instead (and re-creating the objects on 
the other side). But my time-constraints _do_.
