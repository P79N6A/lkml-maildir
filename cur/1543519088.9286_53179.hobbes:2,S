It's not just about SYSENTER, though. It's about providing a framework
so that each syscall can be optimised in the best way *for that
syscall*, yet with a common ABI.
In some cases, a "syscall" won't actually involve a trap to the
kernel, such as gettimeofday(). This is something that would benefit
other architectures.

I'm sure something can be arranged.

I think PER_LINUX is the important one. Besides, this whole proposal
involves changing the ABI, which we can do for PER_LINUX. For other
binary formats, we have to stick to their ABI. So I don't see how a
jump table would help here.
