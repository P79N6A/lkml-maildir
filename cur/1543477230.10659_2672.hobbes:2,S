Hi,
I have a question regarding the kernel timers.
I need to invoke a function inside the kernel at fixed time intervals. Say
function1.
I created function1 as follows
struct timer_list period_timer;
void function1(void)
 {
    printk(" period Expired \n");                                               
   period_timer.expires=jiffies + 60*HZ; /* sixty seconds */                             
   period_timer.function = &function1;                                        
   add_timer(&period_timer);             
}           
I expected that every 60 seconds function1 will get invoked and print 
the string given in printk.
I included this function inside ide.c and initialised the timer
appropriately. 
However when I compile the kernel and boot from this kernel
function1 goes to a infinite loop and prints the string at very fast
rate. Definitely not once per minute.
What is wrong with this ?
Some help is much appreciated.
Thanx
Ravi
