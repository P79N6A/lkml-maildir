No disagreement there. If Ingo would care to comment, I think it might
be an acceptable compromise to have x86 fully use kprobes/djprobes
immediately, and the other archs could walk there at their rate.
Practically, some stuff in include/asm-i386/markers.h and
include/asm-x86_64/markers.h would contain the binary modifiable stuff
and include/asm-generic/markers.h could contain a platform-independent
fallback.

That's another possibility. It seems more C friendly than the simple
short-jump+3bytes.
Ingo?
