If Greg is OK with that I would start with truly mechanical merge (no
now data structures, just move the files around) and merge this ASAP,
before we hit -rc1 or -rc2 at the latest. Then you can start puling up
your changesin the separate git tree.

am afraid I won't have enought time at the moment.
