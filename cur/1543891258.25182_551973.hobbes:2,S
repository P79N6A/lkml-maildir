Good. Then there is nothing further to discuss.

You have a very serious misunderstanding of what 'select' does. The 'select'
function is level triggered and state based, not edge triggered or event
based. The situation was the same as before, and so the same result is
required.
The kernel assumes that either you handled the error condition or you aren't
going to handle the error condition. In either case, the correct thing to do
is to again inform you of the error.
Suppose the first 'select' comes from code that is just curious how many
sockets are ready but has no intention of handling the events. Not reporting
the error on the next call to 'select' would be disastrous.
