i fixed this problem in -M5 the other way around: the IRQ threads follow
the affinity settings. They will bind themselves to the first CPU in the
affinity mask and they migrate only at 'safe' points (between hardirqs).
this way e.g. user-space irqbalance will automatically move the IRQ
threads around too.
