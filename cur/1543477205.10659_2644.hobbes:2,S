Not related to this, but I (hopefully correctly) observed that SHM
swap I/O is done synchronously.
Could somebody spare a minute to explain why is that so, and what
needs to be done to make SHM swapping asynchronous?
Also, while we're at MM fixes, I'm appending below a small patch that
will improve interactive feel.
After number of async pages gets bigger than pager_daemon.swap_cluster
(= SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX), swapin readahead becomes synchronous, and that
hurts performance. It is better to skip readahead in such situations,
and that is also more fair to swapout. Andrea came to exactly the same
conclusion, independent of me (on the same day :)).
