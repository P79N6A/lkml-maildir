Very good, now I can do away with mdir and friends, I've been longing to
just type 'A' again and know that I'm on my trusty floppy drive.
Perhaps I'll whip up something that monitors /dev/log and can return the
sanity of Abort/Retry/Ignore to Linux. This should be integrated with bash
but as your namespace patches need some work in that area too, that should
not be a problem.
Thanks Albert!
