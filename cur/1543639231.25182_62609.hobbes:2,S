Subject: [PATCH 2.5.30+] Second attempt at a shared credentials patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/8/8/131

This patch allows tasks to share credentials via a flag to clone().
This version fixes the problem with exec() that Linus found.  Tasks that
call exec() get their own copy of the credentials at that point.
The URL is here because it's too big to include in email:

The patch is against Linus' BK tree as of this morning.
