While I think we need to fix this issue, and in general the issue of MSI
interrupts on PCI-Express busses downstream of hypertransport chains.
This e1000 issue is not a regression, so not fixing it for 2.6.20 is
not a big deal.
I have yet to see all of the pieces I'm trying to look at confirmed,
but I believe by at least looking at the hypertransport MSI mapping
capability's enable bit in general we should be able to do a much
better job of detecting if MSI works in a system or not.
I though someone several months ago had made our MSI supported detect logic
a lot smarter, with defaults that were generally correct, but looking
at the kernel that code apparently never made it anywhere.  Instead
all I see are a handful of common chipsets special cased by the quirk logic.
We should be able to do a lot better but not in the 2.6.20 time frame.
As for the original problem report with duplicate MSI interrupts in
/proc/interrupts.  That sounds like a regression and is probably
simple to fix if we can get some more details.
