Not sure quite what you mean here ... if you want to volunteer to
maintain a specific subsection, you can just email me or 
bugme-admin@osdl.org.

I'm hoping to spread the admin load out amongst different people - 
one of the things for a system like this is that it's easier to scale 
it up by spreading the load. Anything that's not picked up by external 
people will have the slack picked up by some IBM people, to make sure 
the database doesn't end up as a fetid cesspit of festering stale 
misinformation ;-)
