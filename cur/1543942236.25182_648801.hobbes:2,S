I agree with you that a court can decide that the usage of a
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL symbol is not derivative work, but I see the
likelihood of this happening as almost non existent. And even if so then
you still have to deal with the fact that the license of this symbol is
clearly GPL. No questions asked about that, because it says so and due
technical means you can't load a non-GPL kernel module that uses
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL symbol without tainting the kernel.
The same fact is valid in userspace where you can't link (not even
runtime) a GPL library into a non-GPL program.
However if anyone wants to fight the license, be my guest and do so :)

All big companies are going this way. And licenses beside, there are
valid technical points in making your driver open source and get it
merged upstream. Just a hint for all these binary-only people :)
