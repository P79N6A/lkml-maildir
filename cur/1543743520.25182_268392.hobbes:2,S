John pointed out that this breaks modules.  Would registering and 
unregistering a function pointer thus be module safe?  Dipankar, hopefully 
you have something better?
static int timer_start(void)
{
 /* Setup the callback pointer */
 oprofile_timer_notify = oprofile_timer;
 return 0;
}
static void timer_stop(void)
{
 /* Tear down the callback pointer after sync_kernel */
 synchronize_kernel();
 oprofile_timer_notify = NULL;
}
Thanks,
Jesse
