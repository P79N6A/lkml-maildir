If it's like some of the CF-IDE adapters I've seen, the DMA request/ack 
lines likely aren't even wired up between the card and the cable. 
There's no way the kernel can detect that DMA is not actually possible 
on such a card without trying and waiting for it to timeout. (I've seen 
a few which have jumpers which select whether to connect these or not - 
haven't a clue why you wouldn't want to hook those up unconditionally..)
Isn't there an option to disable DMA for a specific IDE channel 
(ide2=nodma or something like that)?
