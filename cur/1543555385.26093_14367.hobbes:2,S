Hi,
In vfree() shouldn't we be dropping vmlist_lock spinlock as soon as we
unlinked the item from the vmlist? I.e. before we free the actual pages
and the vm_struct itself. Or, perhaps it should be done _after_
vmfree_area_pages() but definitely before kfree(tmp) since tmp is no
longer visible outside the function. (My only doubt whether
vmfree_area_pages() should be inside the lock is because those pages may
otherwise be reused for the next vmalloc request).
(actually I put that spinlock in vfree and get_vm_area so at the time it
seemed "obviously correct" but now I am having thoughts that it can still
be optimized more).
Regards,
Tigran
