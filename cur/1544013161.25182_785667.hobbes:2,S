yep, every sync() causes a gratuitous write to disk N seconds later
even when no data has been read or written since the last sync().
$ while sleep 5; do sync; done

I'm going to run without laptop mode for a while to see how this
goes.  This system is a small router/firewall with most writes going
to a tmpfs so the number of writes to the ext3 fs is only a few a
month (provided no one logs into the system to do a config change).
Thanks for the help.
