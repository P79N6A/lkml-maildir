Hi,
more importantly, does 2.6.21-rc3 work for you? There are not that many 
USB HID/hidinput specific patches in -mm, so it would show clearly whether 
it's problem in USB HID/hidinput, or somewhere else.
What keyboard is that please? (vedor/product ids)
Also, if it turns out to be HID problem - could you please send output of 
both working and non-working kernels with hid/usbhid debugging enabled?
If this is present also in vanilla and not only in -mm, could you please 
try reverting commits 4237081e573b99a48991aa71364b0682c444651c and 
d4ae650a904612ffb7edd3f28b69b022988d2466 and let me know if the situation 
gets any better?
Thanks,
