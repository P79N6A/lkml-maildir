Since you already have separate functions for memory barriers, I would think
not guarenteeing ordering would be the sensible thing to do. Keep it simple.
IFF it is shown that almost every time you do the atomic_xxx() functions the
code also needs the memory barrier, then you can consider adding this to the
function.
