block size changing is dangerous:
if you change the blocksize of a mounted partition you'll disrupt the
filesystem.
some kernels crash hard if you execute
	swapon /dev/<insert your root device>
swapon won't overwrite your root fs: it changes the blocksize to 4kB and
then notices that there is no swap signature.
But the blocksize change is fatal.

that's 2.5.

I have one additional user space only idea:
have you tried raw-io? bind a raw device to the partition, IIRC raw-io
is always in 512 byte units.
Probably an ioctl is the better idea, but I'd use absolute sector
numbers (not relative to the end), and obviously 64-bit sector numbers -
2 TB isn't that far away.
