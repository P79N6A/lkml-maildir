	Except that loading the module is not infringement. The GPL does not

	In order for there to be an "infringing derivative work", some clause of
the GPL would have to be infringed. There exists no clause in the GPL that
restricts the *creation* of derivative works that are not distributed.
	If your argument were correct, then no non-GPL'd software could *ever* be
distributed for Linux. You see, loading that software would create an
"infringing derivative work" in the memory of the computer running it,
combining the Linux kernel with the software.
