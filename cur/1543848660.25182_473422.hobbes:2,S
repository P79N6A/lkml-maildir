SSI intrudes kernel in two places: a) IO system calls, b ) page fault  
code for shared memory pages.
a) IO system calls are "packed" and forwarded to the "home" node, where 
original syscall code is executed.
b) A hook is inserted into page fault code that brings shared memory 
pages from other nodes when necessary.
Apart from these two hooks, SSI code is a "standalone" kernel API add-on 
("add", not "change").
Currently, we can do both "intrusions" from the kernel module. I assume 
that if we submit code, you will require a kernel patch that explicitly 
calls our hooks.
Also, continuous SSI in-kernel support may require SSI changes in the 
following cases: a) new fields in task struct that reflect process state 
(may affect task migration), b) changes in the page fault mechanism (may 
effect SSI shared memory code that brings and invalidates pages), c) 
addition of new system calls (may require implementation of  SSI 
suspport for them).
