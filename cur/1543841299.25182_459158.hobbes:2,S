Subject: [RFC][PATCH 2/9] conditionally define generic get_order() (ARCH_HAS_GET_ORDER)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch makes asm-generic/page.h safe to include in lots of code.  This
prepares it for the introduction shortly of the generic PAGE_SIZE code.
There was some discussion that ARCH_HAS_FOO is a disgusting mechanism and
should be wiped off the face of the earth.  It was argued that these things
introduce unnecessary complexity, reduce greppability, and obscure the
conditions under which FOO was defined.  I agree with *ALL* of this.  I
think this patch is different. ;)
This is very greppable.  If you grep and see foo() showing up in
asm-generic/foo.h, it is *obvious* that it is a generic version.  If you
see another version in asm-i386/foo.h, it is also obvious that i386 has
(or can) override the generic one.
As for obscuring the conditions under which it is defined, you do this when
you are either missing a symbol, or have duplicate symbols.  So, you want to
know:
1. *IS* the generic one being defined?
2. When is this generic defined (and how do I turn it off)?
3. How to I get the damn thing defined (if the symbol is missing)?
With Kconfig, this is all easy, especially for arch-specific stuff.
If you requiring that the non-generic symbol be defined first:
	
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/422942/match=very
+complex+xyzzy+don+t+want
it gets awfully messy because you end up having to fix up all of the
architectures' headers that define the thing to get rid of any circular
dependencies.
So, is _this_ patch disgusting?
