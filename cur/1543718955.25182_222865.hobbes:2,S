PAGG does not provide any control capabilities and anyone who wished to 
use PAGG for control would have to use existing control interfaces.  So 
this argument does not apply.

I don't think that it's that bad.  The problem is that CKRM (which is 
huge) wants to do everything itself (and its way).  In reality, CKRM 
needs a lot of lower level features that don't currently exist and many 
of these features have merit in their own right independent of CKRM's 
need for them.  These lower level features should be separated out from 
CKRM and presented as the (potentially) small and easy to understand 
mechanisms that they are.  Other developers would then be free to use 
these mechanisms as they see fit (probably using them for innovative 
things not envisaged by any of us).  To fully realize their potential 
these features need to (where it's sensible) support multiple 
simultaneous clients and be as efficient and easy to use as possible 
(and some of the ideas present in PAGG would help in this regard).
