Yes, that's how I would have written it, but I tried to keep with the
prevailing style in that file.  I suppose I could see an argument for
consistency if you had a long series of if() statements to keep a
similar style.
if (foo == value1)
if (bar == value2)
if (baz == NULL)
I'll leave the discussion of putting the constant first in the comparison
for someone else to comment on.
