No, "jiffies will still be the same size and granularity (10ms on 
i386). This is the low-level time in the kernel. I'm dealing with 
high-level (user visible) time. Interestingly, user-visible time can 
have a higher accuracy than the kernel low-level time, because we 
interpolate with fast timeoffsets between interrupts. Currently up to 
1 microsecond, mybe soon up to 1nanosecond (where hardware permits).

BTW: What is the advantage to set the kernel time back to 1600? (It's 
not for Windows/NT compatibility, is it?)
