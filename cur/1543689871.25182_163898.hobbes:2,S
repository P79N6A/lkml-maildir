Only if you omit CONFIG_MTRR. MTRR support is independent of
which CPU type you chose to optimise for.

A 486 kernel will use TSC if there is one. CONFIG_TSC (derived
from configured CPU type) allows the kernel to skip checking
for _not_ having a TSC; !CONFIG_TSC only means it has to check
before using it.

CONFIG_M586 supports both, with some performance loss for the K7,
but that's your choice.

So configure for the lowest common denominator. As long as your
embedded system isn't SMP, L1 cache line size assumptions don't
matter much, so you only lose (a) gcc -march= optimisations that
aren't common to both CPU types you support, and (b) some features
(like TSC if it isn't common to both) may need a runtime test
and/or dynamic dispatch. Given your insistence on having a common
kernel, this is the best you can do.

K7 is PIII (or PII, but I don't think so) + some stuff.
Admittedly, the kernel could include some more performance-tweaking
CONFIG options (mainly for L1 cache size and gcc -mcpu= values),
but that's a simple thing to add if necessary.
