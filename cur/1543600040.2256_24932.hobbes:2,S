I think I was agreeing with you, but I think what you meant was
that when you load the module, it expands the slab, but with
a /non-atomic/ alloc. And what I meant was that as the
page reclaim stuff is dumb in terms of recovering buddies
of existing pages, it will chew away for a good while until
it happens to find a large enough hole. But this isn't really
a problem if it happens on module load only.

We have lots of interesting current restrictions, like we assume
IP packets are contiguous in memory, and we assume we can allocate
their buffers atomically. I suspect there will not be many fans
of non-contiguous IP packet models. [Historics: the buddy system
was originally introduced to cope with fragments which reassembled
to >4k in length, though devices like HSSI with 4470 byte MTU's
are going to have the same problem without fragmentation]
No argument that scatter/gather is better if possible & practical
(SCSI comes to mind).
