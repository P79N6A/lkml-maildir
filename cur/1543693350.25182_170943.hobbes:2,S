You should pay a lawyer and learn something then.

Sorry but usage of headers the functional api is an unprotectable work.
To follow up on the point of boundaries, it is abstract interface to
properly work as a driver in the given space.
Alternative view, using the MS DDK and the associated headers for running
in MicroSoft.  Because a driver uses MicroSoft Headers, does it make it a
derived work belonging to MicroSoft?

US Copyright and courts the rest of the pathetic world is lame and brain
dead and even follows our stupidity with DMCA laws also.
<see flame bait, above>
Lawyers who make up the meaning of the laws.  You should really decide to
spend some money to get an expensive education.  $10,000 USD or Euro
should be enough to rudely open your eyes to how the courts operate.
Copyright law is so strange and painful.
I know it was an expensive lesson for me to start writing checks to
lawyers, but less costly than making mistakes based on ignorance.

Does tongue in cheek mean anything?

PS one day I will figure out how to enable the spell check in pine, sigh.
