sorry, but you must have missed the patch i posted yesterday. It can be
done, it's fast, it does not hurt *any* benchmark and it actually has a
worst-case cache-cold latency of 10 microseconds, even if 1 million
threads are started up already.
and besides it significantly speeds up some other areas as well, like
session management in shells, group-signal delivery performance, tty
handling and more.
