Beginning early in the 2.3.2X cycle I started getting:
Nov 28 09:10:36 wr5z kernel: Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ
config error?
errors in my log with attendant sound dropouts when playing mp3 sound
files.  The last version which worked well was 2.3.18.  Are chainges
being made to dma/buffers/cache which might be the cause of some of
these problems?
