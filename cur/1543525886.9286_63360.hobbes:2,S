Actually, 0 would have no capabilities - why give capabilities to a data file?
This makes the table:
id	usage	name	capability
1	35		default	0x00000000000000FF
2	47		root	0x000007F007FFFFFF
3	2		http	0x0000000007F87601
6	5		ftp		0x00000000000005FF
7	0		squid	0x00000F0000FF08FF

The capability list of a process (active object) does not have to match the
initial capability list of a file (passive object). Once the process is
active (with the initial capability list from the passive inode) the process
can (should) always drop capabilities as desired.
It just can't (should not) be able to gain capabilities - or you get into the
"setpriv" problem that the old vax VMS system had ("I only need one privilege
...").
If the active capability list of a process need to be visible, then a
proc/self/caps would be reasonable (as well as proc/<pid>/caps). It should also
be recorded in an audit log and/or accounting log.

The summary (as shown from the table) would be system wide global. The
biggest threat comes from mounting filesystems - If a filesystem is initialized
on one system with a set of capability identifiers, and later mounted on
a different system - with a different set of identifiers, then the files
residing on the filesystem will gain/lose some arbitrary set of capabilities.
The capability list table should be stored in/with the superblock, and the active
list is formed by concatenating the list of all mounted file systems. This implies
that s lookup of a capability identifier includes the mount device. It would
even allow for the capability identifier table to exist as a reserved inode, that
could be independantly edited, and loaded into the kernel on mount. Having the
capability table on the same file system would make the reference count cumulative
and accurate (as well as fixable by fsck).
The actual inode caching only provides immediate access to the capability
identifier - which would NOT be used by the active object (the process that
may be associated with the inode).
