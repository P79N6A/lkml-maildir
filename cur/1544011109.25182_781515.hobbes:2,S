Actually, taking both to archprepare would work fine.  kern_constants.h
used to be generated in very interesting ways before it became a copy
of asm-offsets.h and that's what lead to this mess.
These days we can safely take the rudiments out.  Note that asm-offsets.h
generation doesn't care about that file, be it a symlink or #include "....",
for obvious reasons and neither does generation of user_constants.h.
The only remaining constraints are
	* asm-offsets.s needs user_constants.h already created.
	* we want kern_constants.h available during the build itself (i.e.
at the same kind of places where asm-offsets.h could be used).
AFAICS, having archprepare depend on user_constants.h and kern_constants.h
would do just fine.  Note that we don't care how these two are ordered;
it's asm-offsets.h that can't be created without user_constants.h.
