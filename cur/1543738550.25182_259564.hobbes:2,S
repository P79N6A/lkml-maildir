Hello,
please CC me to your replies as I'm not currently a subscriber; thanks in
advance.
I have a Problem with kernel 2.6.8.1 and maybe the sata_via driver. It hang while booting.
The following messages appear:
SCSI device sda: 390721968 512-byte hdwr sectors (2000050MB)
SCSI device sda: drive cache: write back
sda:<3>ata1: command 0x25 timeout, stat 0x50 host_stat 0x4
after 5 seconds:
sda1 sda2 sda3 sda4 <
then there is nothing more.
Kernel 2.4.25 works so i think my Hardware (A7V600-X, Sempron 2800+, SEGATE ST3200822AS) is ok.
Any hints what is wrong? Thanks in advance for your help.
Best Regards,
Andreas Grabner
