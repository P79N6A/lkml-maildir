And how is userspace supposed to protect itself from race conditions?
Just compare:
fd1 = open(path1);
if (stat(fd1) looks fishy)
	abort();
fd2 = open(path2);
if (stat(fd2) looks fishy)
	abort();
copy(fd1, fd2);
and:
fd1 = open(path1);
if (stat(fd1) looks fishy)
	abort();
fd2 = open(path2);
if (stat(fd2) looks fishy)
	abort();
copy(path1, path2);
