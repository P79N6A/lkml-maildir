Well, I asked our hardware engineers, and the reason read the MAC
address from the EEPROM is that we don't have an EEPROM on our
boards.  Instead, the bootloader reads some stuff out of NVRAM and
writes it into the MAC address registers of the ethernet chip.
I think the above scheme is a good way to read the MAC, but I'd want
to test it on an actual Yellowfin gigabit card before submitting it.
Anyone out here willing to test?
