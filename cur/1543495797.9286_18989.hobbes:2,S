`Being friendly under crash' is an essential behavior which should not
be made light of.
Your jumbo patch tries to do so many different things at once that I
cannot evaluate it.  Could you please separate out the flushtime
changes versus 2.3.1?  Leave everything else alone.  Then I will
attempt to say something meaningful about it.
atime is a red herring.  It does affect performance, but mounting
noatime doesn't suffice to let a disk spin down when the system is
"idle"; you have to postpone real data writes.  This is something I am
extremely reluctant even to consider, but since there is huge demand,
I will see what can be done.
Also, you took the scan of the locked buffer queue out of bdflush.
Are you sure this is safe?  Running with debugging compiled in, I saw
a dirty buffer on the clean list occasionally - just one, and under
very specific conditions (right at the beginning of bonnie's seek
tests), so there's another bug somewhere else.
