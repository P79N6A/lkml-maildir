Certainly not.
The problem is the soft lockup watchdog tends to produce false-positives
related to the clock resume vs timer interrupt dependencies that are
hard to trace.
I used to get those on a regular basis until the timer resume on x86-64
got fixed a month ago or so.
Please try the latest -mm and see if it's not fixed there.  If not, please
file a bug report with bugzilla (with Cc to me).
Greetings,
Rafael
