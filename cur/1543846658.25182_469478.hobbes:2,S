I think you misunderstand me or i cant explain well :(, plain 2.6.18 boots on 
these system without a problem but same kernel in vmware oopses. Of course 
this can be a just a vmware problem but i can reproduce this behaviour (same 
kernel boots real system but oopes in vmware with same output) with 3 
different normal desktop PC's and two different vmware server version.

Ok, I'll send all configurations and logs

Ok, I'll listen you and will recompile asap:)
