Subject: weird pcmcia problem

Running 2.6.0-test3 (both with and without your recent yenta socket
patches) pcmcia cards present during boot don't show up until they are
removed and reinserted. Once reinserted, they work fine. This only
seems to occur if yenta_socket is build into the kernel; if support is
modular, cards appear to be recognized properly at boot time. I am
running on a thinkpad t21.  Let me know if I can help with this
problem in any way...  thanks
