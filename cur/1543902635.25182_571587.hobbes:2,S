As Paul is on holidays, please take it. The PS3 storage driver core support is
already in mainline, but the actual drivers aren't, as Paul was waiting for
acks from the maintainers.
BTW, do you prefer incremental patches for the comments below, or an update of
the full patchset?

Will replace by 512 resp. >> 9, as per Jens' suggestion.

I needed the definitions just for drive identification.

Good catch!

I used u64 as they're directly passed to hypervisor calls and that's what the
hypervisor calls take.
BTW, Cell will never support a 32-bit kernel, as lots of on-chip stuff lies
outside the 32-bit address space.

Done.

Will change (yes, checkpatch missed it).

I did ;-)

All it complains about is (bogus) <asm/firmware.h> and a single too long line I
don't want to break.

I didn't have much choice, as most of it was static and I don't need the full
libata core anyway.
If I would factor it out, any good suggestion where to put the factored out
code?

Sending storage commands may fail, but being unable to identify the disk isn't
fatal, as it's just for informational purposes.

Were .probe()/.remove() made concurrent again? I thought that idea was dropped
because it caused too many problems?

Hmm, earlier reviewers explicitly asked for putting it there...
Thanks for your comments!
