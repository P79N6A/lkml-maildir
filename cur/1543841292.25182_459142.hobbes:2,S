Sorry for taking so long to test this out.  I just hooked it up with
2.6.18-rc4-mm3 (I built with CONFIG_ACPI_HOTPLUG_MEMORY=y) and I get
ACPI Exception (acpi_bus-0071): AE_NOT_FOUND, No context for object
[ffff81107357a5d0] [20060707]
when I do a hot-add. It might be a day or two before I can sort out what
is going on but I think Yasunori's mail may be getting at the issue. (My
device is only presented to the OS at add time.)
Thanks,
  Keith
