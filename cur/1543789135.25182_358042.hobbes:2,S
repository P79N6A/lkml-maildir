thanks, this log is much more informative. No smoking gun though, but it 
seems something fundamental (probably lowlevel x64 code) has been broken 
by -rt1.
Do the crashes go away if you take the -rc3-rt13 version of 
arch/x86_64/kernel/entry.S and copy it over into the -rc4-rt1 tree?  
[this undoes a particular set of CONFIG_CRITICAL_IRQSOFF_TIMING fixes 
from the x64 code, which i did during -rc3-rt13 => -rc4-rt1]
(Note that doing this will re-introduce tracing bugs, which can result 
in false-positive latency readings - but it should fix any related 
lowlevel bug in the assembly code.)
if this indeed solves the crash then i'd suggest to restore the -rt1 
version of entry.S, and i'd suggest to disable CRITICAL_IRQSOFF_TIMING 
until i fix it. You should be able to get pretty good latency tracing 
info even without CRITICAL_IRQSOFF_TIMING.
