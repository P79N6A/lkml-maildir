My standard way of producing it is mounting the backup fs and then starting yast (SuSE config tool), which is configured to read the data from (the same) nfs-server. Scroll around in the packet selection a bit and exit the tool without installing something. I cannot see however how YaST mounts the fs (which options on mount command). Maybe someone from SuSE can clarify?
Well, I tried with the options you provided and still no luck.
Bye,
