Removing dead code is always good - 0.02% is small, but if 100 kernel 
developers all did the same, that adds up to 2% rather quickly, and that 
is nothing to sneeze at.  I like your patch, but you should add some 
comments for maintainability about what CHECK_IRQ_PER_CPU does - see 
include/asm-generic/pgtable.h for similar styling.  If also probably 
doesn't hurt to leave IRQ_PER_CPU defined even when 
ARCH_HAS_CHECK_IRQ_PER_CPU is not, since it looks cleaner and prevents 
future collisions with bits defined inside of an #ifdef.
