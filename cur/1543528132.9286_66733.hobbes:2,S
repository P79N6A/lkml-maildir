Hi,
Can kernel call a user function of current task? If yes, how?
And another question, Is wppage functions of vm_operations_struct
not used, i mean i want to change the default page fault handler
of a vma for write_faults, but i can not found any reference to
the wppage function in the kernel code.
thanks.
