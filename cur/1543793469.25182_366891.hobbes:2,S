Subject: [RFC] EDAC and the sysfs

I am trying to design the sysfs interface tree for the
new set of EDAC modules that are waiting for this
interface, before being put into the kernel.  
Currently the original EDAC (bluesmoke) has its own
/proc directory (/proc/mc) with files and a directory
(0,1,2,...)for each memory controller on the system.
This will be removed and the new information interface
will be placed in the sysfs.
One proposal is to place the information in
/sys/devices/system in the following directories:
For EDAC general memory ECC controls and information
files:
   /sys/devices/systems/edac/mc/
For PCI Parity Error detection controls and
information files:
   /sys/devices/system/edac/pci
In addition /sys/devices/system/edac/mc/ would  have
directories:
mc0/
mc1/
...
for each memory controller's specific controls and
information.
Currently the similiar error detection device
/sys/devices/system/machinecheck resides here are
well.
The alternative layout would be to use the /sys/class
directory when nested-classes become available:
/sys/class/edac/mc/...
and
/sys/class/edac/pci/...
But edac doesn't quite seem to fit here.
I have failed to date to really find a policy or set
of rules of use for the sysfs as to what goes where
for such items as EDAC. After searching the web,
articles and thinking about this for some time now, I
am requesting comments on the sysfs model for where
EDAC would fit best.
I currently favor the /sys/devices/system/edac
placement at the moment, but would welcome input.
thanks
