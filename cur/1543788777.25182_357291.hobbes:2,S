If you had read the source code rather than just the comments you would 
have seen that this is not true.  It can return NULL (see 
fs/buffer.c::__getblk_slow()).  Certainly I would prefer to keep the 
checks in NTFS, please.  They may only be good for catching bugs but I 
like catching bugs rather than segfaulting due to a NULL dereference.
Best regards,
