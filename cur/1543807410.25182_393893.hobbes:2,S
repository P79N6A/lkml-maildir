> yes, but still that is a global attribute:
Ok ... I am starting to see where you are going with this.
Well, certainly not global in the sense that a selected cache would be
spread over the whole system.  The data set read in by the job in one
cpuset must not pollute the memory of another cpuset.
But it -might- work to mark certain caches to be memory spread across
the current cpuset (to be precise, across current->mems_allowed), as
the default kernel placement policy for those selected caches, with
no per-cpuset mechanism to specify otherwise.
Or it might not work.
I don't know tonight.
I will have to wait for others to chime in.
