Hi all!
Great work. My Girlfriend's Vaio GR114EK seems more or less to be happy with 2.5.42.
But there are (of course) some problems:
1. Doing 'make menuconfig' I can't activate ACPI sleep states. It always falls back. Strange...
2. When I try to load uhci-hcd, I get the following error message:
Oct 12 17:32:29 tuxli kernel: Debug: sleeping function called from illegal conte
xt at include/asm/semaphore.h:119
Oct 12 17:32:29 tuxli kernel: Call Trace: [__might_sleep+84/96]  [<d0849436>]  [
<d083fa8d>]  [<d0849436>]  [<d083fd15>]  [<d083fce0>]  [default_wake_function+0/
52]  [<d084ca6c>]  [<d084ca6c>]  [kernel_thread_helper+5/12]
3. After loading eepro100 I reach the network with ping's but when I generate other traffic like downloading or getting E-Mails the card hangs. But there are no error messages in the log-files:-( 
A similar error also occures in the 2.4.19 kernel. After some traffic with ssh the connection hangs. Therefore I use 2.4.18 which is running fine at the moment - altough there are some troubles with irq-routing, because the missing acpi support.
4. I'm unable to get the usb-mouse working. I've loaded the ehci-hcd, uinput, hid module. I'm also unsuccessful with the usbmouse module.:-( 
Tips are welcome:-)
Kind regards
Marc Giger
