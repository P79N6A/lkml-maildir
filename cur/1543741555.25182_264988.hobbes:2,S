Eww.
2.6.10 got an -rc about 4 days after 2.6.9 went stable.  This would be a
bit too rapid for my tastes; I don't like ideas that potentially load
maintainers.

Yes, a little too much to maintain though isn't it?  Maintainers to
continuously upkeep revisions that come out every few weeks potentially?

Common courteousy, don't volunteer people.  :)

Sounds too fast.  I don't predict having a maintainer for each minor
release of the kernel (which is what you're saying here essentially), so
there'd be a need for one or a handfull of maintainers to spend loads of
time backporting fixes to a quickly mounting set of kernels.
I had <shameless plug> suggested an hour or two ago a scheme where the
current development model be based off, but periodic releases be made
"stable," basing on approximately 6 months between releases </shameless
plug>.  I think it's a bit more sane to say that a maintainer may mount
up 4 kernels in 2 years to backport bugfixes into, if nobody else steps
up to the plate to help.
Of course, eventually official support has to be dropped in either
scheme, because the same problem is faced:  We can't expect people to
maintain a continuously mounting number of kernel revisions once the
workload becomes sufficiently high.  A balance must be made between
dropping support for a non-volitile code base, and maintaining a support
period sufficiently long.
