A simple flag with each I/O request meaning "high priority due to
interactive process I/O".  Make the elevator select high priority
requests before low ones, with the same sequence number bound for
fairness as has recently been implemented.
Maybe even a small holdoff time when going from handling a high priority
to a low priority request, to give the interactive process a few
microseconds to stimulate another page in.  (Actually a small holdoff in
general between I/O "here" and I/O "far away" might improve overall seek
times, orthogonal to priority issues).
It does seem too simple to work, but has anyone tried it?
