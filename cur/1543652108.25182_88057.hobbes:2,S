.. but I don't think we have any real users who use them for recursion,
so the only "recursion" right now is through interrupts that use this
feature.
(At least that was true a long time time ago, maybe we've added truly
recursive users since)

That depends on whether it is even sanely implementable to share the
same lock. It may not be. 
From a migration standpoint it would be easiest (by far) to be able to
share the lock type and to mix operations (ie an interrupt - or
recursive user - could just use the non-fair version, while others could
use the fair version on the same lock).  However, I have this nagging
suspicion that it might be a total nightmare to implement efficiently in
practice. 
I've not looked at it. Any ideas?
