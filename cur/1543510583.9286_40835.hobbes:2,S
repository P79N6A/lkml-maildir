Yes, and we need to shut them down cleanly, reinitialize them and then
restart the drivers. #2 is difficult from userspace after #1.

Yes, but you have to do legacy init again then and have the driver save
state before that so it can restart properly afterwards. Also, how do you
want to handle conditionals in the AML code? You disagreed with the idea
of a compiler that would build modules and insert them and with the idea
of a static VM. I cannot see how this should work otherwise.

Do you really think that the chance for inclusion into the kernel should
be the unit of measure here? I like a clean solution that I have to apply
manually more than a dirty one that comes with the tarball.
Anyways, there is much to be done before, for example the shutdown/restart
code in the native drivers. Assuming they maintain state is nice, but a
clean shutdown is better.
