1. kernel panic on 8 way server
2. it is OK to run 2.2.12 on 8way xeon server.
but, we have 4GB system, and tried 2.3.19~2.3.20 on it.
we have tried with/without BIGMEM.
it is crashed with "Attempted to kill the idle task" message.
is there some problem in Intel 8way server ?
i don't think so. 2.2.12 runs very well (but it only find 2GB...)
if you have some idea, please reply to me. thanks in advance.
