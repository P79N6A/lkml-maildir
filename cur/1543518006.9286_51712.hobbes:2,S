Actually there is no reason it needs to be accepted into the linux
kernel. You can just use it as a loadable glue module (I believe the OSS
guys use a similar scheme). You just have to maintain the glue module
(or at least keep it free so that others can fix it).
This solves the API problem, although not the random bugs in drivers
problem. Unfortunately Linux will be blamed if the binary only drivers
crash :-/ I fear encouragement of binary drivers will lead to a true
"linux headed for desaster" on a longer time.
Microsoft has a similar problem BTW, they say that a significant part
of the stability problems in NT4 came from third party binary only drivers,
and having seen the code of some of the vendor drivers recently released
for Linux I have no problems to believe that. I don't say that your
drivers are bad [I don't know], but you will certainly agree that there
are a lot of bad drivers around.
Your example of Solaris being more stable with binary only drivers
was a bit bogus BTW, because a Sparc usually runs with Sun provided hardware
and drivers [so Sun can fix them]. MacOS I would not cite as an example 
for stability.Netware neither [Netware with random third party NLMs is hell].

As I said, there is no reason to keep such a layer in the core kernel,
it can be a loadable module developed outside the kernel tree without problems.
