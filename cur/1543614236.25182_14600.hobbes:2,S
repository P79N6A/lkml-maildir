Dear all,
In a case of permission deny on dentry_open(). Is it possible to overide
that in the kernel?
Process context calls remain the same EUID of user space, is there any 
way to override that in the kernel, since we might have something 
prviledge to do with. dentry_open() is made in my own file system.
Thanks.
David
