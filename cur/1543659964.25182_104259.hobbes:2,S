	    I do have respect for you; however, I have one simple question.
    Should I call my system GNU/Linux/XFree86/KDE in order to give most
    everyone proper credit?
See 
http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#many.
      Favorable or not, "Linux" has become the symbol for a whole
    system of free software.
The meaning attached to this symbol is one we disagree with (see
http://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html
), so we will not accept
it as the symbol of our work.
I see a hint of "give up, it's hopeless" in your message.  In that
context, see 
http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#lost.
