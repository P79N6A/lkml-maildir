Umm...  Actually in -pre3 UMSDOS is still functional (and ->u.umsdos_inode_info
is still there).  I'll break it in the next series of patches ;-)
BTW, maintainers of filesystems are welcome to send patches.  Stuff in
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/MA* should be enough to figure it out - everything
is fairly straightforward.
Two notes:
*	unlike the ->u, private components of inode are _not_
zeroed out by VFS in the new scheme, so you need to do explicit
initialization in foo_read_inode()/foo_new_inode.
*	please, call the generic part 'vfs_inode'.  In this case it's
more than just being consistent - it avoids tons of false positives
in sanity checks (in general a structure with struct inode as a field
is bad news)
