  Or forgotten to make oldconfig, or lots of other things. But that
doesn't make a good argument for putting the config permanently in /proc
instead of saving it if you want it, does it? If you could remember to
make the module with the config, you could remember to save it. Or even
have modules_install save the info in a file in the modules directory,
that would get the info without locking it in memory.
