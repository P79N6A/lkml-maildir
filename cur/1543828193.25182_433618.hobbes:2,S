Well, the aim of my patch is to stop enabling MSI by default, and try to
find out when we can and when we cannot use MSI. 2.6.17 will only
disable MSI on a few chipsets. My patch will disable on all chipsets but
Intel and those having Hypertransport MSI capabilities (Serverworks
HT2000 and nVidia CK804). Thus, you cannot expect MSI to be enabled with
my patch if it was not before :/

If your board is behind one of these bridges, MSI could work (looks like
you have 4 nVidia CK804 with MSI enabled in the Hypertransport mapping).

It might be the reason why MSI does not work. But I am not familiar with
this code, so I can't help, sorry.
