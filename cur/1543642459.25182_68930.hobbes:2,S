Ultimately, to me at least, the server doesn't really matter, and
neither do the absolute benchmark numbers. Linux should scale under 
any reasonable workload. The point of this is to look at the Linux
kernel, not the webserver, or specweb ... they're just hammers to
beat on the kernel with.
The fact that we're doing something different from everyone else
and turning up a different set of kernel issues is a good thing, 
to my mind. You're right, we could use Tux if we wanted to ... but
that doesn't stop Apache being interesting ;-)
