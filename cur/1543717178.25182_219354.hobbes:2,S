Does the 2.6.6 Changelog section about nforce2 imply that Ross' Patches of
Stability are no longer required? I don't read lkml regularely, so this
would be new for me.
Anyway, if this works (tm) I am very happy. Will attempt to test it later
on, even though I have Maxtor 8MB discs :)

	[PATCH] fixup for C1 Halt Disconnect problem on nForce2 chipsets
	Based on information provided by "Allen Martin" <AMartin@nvidia.com>:
	A hang is caused when the CPU generates a very fast CONNECT/HALT
	cycle sequence.  Workaround is to set the SYSTEM_IDLE_TIMEOUT to
	80 ns. This allows the state-machine and timer to return to a
	proper state within 80 ns of the CONNECT and probe appearing
	together.  Since the CPU will not issue another HALT within 80 ns
	of the initial HALT, the failure condition is avoided.
