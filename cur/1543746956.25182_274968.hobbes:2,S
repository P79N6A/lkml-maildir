Subject: [patch] make root_plug more useful via whitelist
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

patch: 
http://fredemmott.co.uk/files/rp.patch
This adds a whitelist of programs such as /bin/login and /sbin/agetty which 
may be ran as root without the USB device prescent. It also includes my 
earlier patch to check the USB device's serial number as well as 
vendor/product.
This is not meant for inclusion; I'd appreciate comments on anything I've done 
wrong, and suggestions on how to make it distribution neutral (at the moment 
it probably only works correctly on slackware) - I'm thinking of adding a 
security/root_plug_relax/ directory containing files such as "slackware.h" 
"redhat.h" etc.
Thanks for your time,
