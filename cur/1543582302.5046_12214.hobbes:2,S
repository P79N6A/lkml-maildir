This smells bad.  Datagram protocol send sizes are only limited by
socket buffer size, nothing more.  Fragmentation makes it work.
If you are really talking about side effects of UDP path-mtu, then I
will turn off UDP path-mtu by default in 2.4.x because it is obviously
very broken either conceptually or in our implementation. :-)
