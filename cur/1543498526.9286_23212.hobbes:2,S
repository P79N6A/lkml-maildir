	I couldn't agree more with you there.  Now having actually looked
more carefully through the code it would appear that even where profanity
is used there is also quite a bit of appropriate info given.  I had
initially gotten the impression there were such things as 'SHIT[%d]' in
the kernel, with nothing more than that.  However, if you actually go
look and not just fgrep I at least have found that many times the next
line has lots of debugging info...
