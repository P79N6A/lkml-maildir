ARGH!  Damnit!  How many times do I have to say this!  I have this
awesome *quintuple range* orksafagen distiller!
I developed it in 1968, but every time I try to send to the patch to
someone, their 'patch' command chokes on it with 'negative date' or
something.  If you set your clock forward to 2036, though, it works
great.
