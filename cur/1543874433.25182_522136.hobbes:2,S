hm, OK.  Rafael has been working on fixing the process freezer and it'll
take some time to get it to where we want it to be, I expect.
Rafael, I think that we could afford to add heaps of debug in there at this
stage to help us track down problems like this.
Also, it might be useful to add a temporary /proc/freeze-unfreeze thing
which will simply do a freeze/unfreeze cycle.  Then we can apply various
workloads to the machine while madly stressing the freezer code.
