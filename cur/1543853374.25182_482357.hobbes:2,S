A bit of history:  this driver was merged in March 2005 (submitted by 
Chelsio), updated once in June 2005, and then the maintainers completely 
disappeared.
So, you get what you get...  if someone wants to dig through the updated 
cxgb driver and merge it with the kernel and test it... great.  But at 
this point it is abandonware.
