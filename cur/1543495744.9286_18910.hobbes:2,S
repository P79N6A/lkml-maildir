What about just reversing the patch for 2.2.9? Was there bug in
bdflush? I though we are in feature freeze!

<SARCASTIC MODE ON>Great news, tell that to 10M users out there
:-(. You may even post slashdot message "everybody go and upgrade to
2.2.8, it screws up filesystems".</SARCASTIC>

You don't like idea of postponing writes indefinitely and suggest me
to break my system with noatime. I like idea of postponing writes
until sync is given. That is legal and it is definitely less breakage
of unix semantics than noatime.
