Hello!
Historically, users, like me, have been able to download a "stable"
kernel. With the new development model, where it is up to distributions
to "stabilise" the kernel, these days are gone. This is a, sort-of,
regression from my POV, making it so much harder for DIY-"distros" like
LFS (and to a lesser extent gentoo). I realise this has been debated quite
a lot before, and as an illiterate when it comes to C-programming ("hello
world" is the limit for me right now) I cannot contribute (so far). Ok,
that's all I have to say. I'm gonna crawl under the rock from where I came
now...
Best regards
Peter Karlsson
