We discussed this change to death afair, so I'm a little surprised you
say that. The commit message itself has good reasoning as well.

OK, I can give a brief summary. The driver can set two restrictions -
hardware and physical. I'm not sure who originally came up with the
naming (I think it's prety terrible), but essentially the 'hardware'
restriction is what the hardware can support (OK that name works) and
the 'physical' restriction is imposed by the driver. Typically that last
restriction has to do with structure limitations, like allocating stuff
on the stack or limiting the size of the sgtable you have to allocate.

Confused, as I mentioned, we discussed this at quite some length a few
months ago.

Depends on what you think it does. The number of hardware segments will
never be larger than the physical segments. But it looks like you want
to set the hw seg value there. As mentioned in the commit above, since
libata doesn't allocate its own sg tables, letting it fiddle with the
physical segment limit is dodgy at best.
