That is an easy one.
It belongs to the recent partitioning discussion on l-k.
Windows knows the type of partition table, so reads the
partition table and the boot sector and the FAT and is happy.
Linux tries various things, depending on how you compiled your kernel,
and among other things also needs to examine the last sector.
So, only Linux will do bad things in case the capacity is off by one,
and only when your config includes partitioning types that use this
last sector.
