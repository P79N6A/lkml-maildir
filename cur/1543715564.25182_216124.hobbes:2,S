   The reason is because fb_find_mode calls check_var for us. No reason to 
call it twice. The large yres_virtual being 30000 that is not needed any 
longer. The accel flag is set in neofb_check_var. The current test is
if (var->bits_per_pixel >= 24 || !par->neo2200)
	var->accel_flags &= ~FB_ACCEL_TEXT;
Should we drop the bpp >= 24 test? Do you observe this problem at all 
depths.
