Subject: NUMA mempolicy /proc code in mainline shouldn't have been merged

Hi,
Just noticed the ugly SGI /proc/*/numa_maps code got merged.  I argued
several times against it and I very deliberately didn't include
a similar facility when I wrote the NUMA policy code because it's a bad
idea.
- it's a lot of ugly code.
- it's basically only a debugging hack right now
- it presents lots of kernel internal information and mempolicy
internals (like how many people have a page mapped) etc.
to userland that shouldn't be exposed to this.
- the format is very complicated and the chance of bug free
userland parsers of this is near zero.
- there is no demonstrated application that needs it
(there was a theoretical usecase where it might be needed,
but there were better solutions proposed for this) 
Can the patch please be removed? 
Thanks,
-Andi
