Subject: 2.6.12: apm / clock issues.

Starting from 2.6.12, when going into user standby, my system clock gets reset. Previously, user standby would generate an event for apmd which invokes the apmd_proxy script to restore the clock, but it's no longer functioning from 2.6.12 onwards. Anyone experiencing something similar?
