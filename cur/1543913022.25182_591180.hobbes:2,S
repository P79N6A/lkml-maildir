That would be essentially linux supported undervolting which 
for stability is as bad as overclocking. The problem is that 
such games tend to generate weird kernel crashes and then
chew up development issues when kernel hackers have to chase
ghost bugs. I don't think we should support it. Developer 
time is too precious.
