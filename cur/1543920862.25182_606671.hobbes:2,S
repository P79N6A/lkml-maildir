Take a real life example:
drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c
	/* Disable interrupts! */
	CHIPREG_WRITE32(&ioc->chip->IntMask, 0xFFFFFFFF);
	ioc->active = 0;
	synchronize_irq(pdev->irq);
And we aren't in a spinlock here. 
That's just a random example grepped.... I think I see a few more. Then,
some drivers like tg3 actually do an smp_mb() before calling
synchronize_irq(). But then, some don't.
I think trying to have all drivers be correct here is asking for
trouble, we'd rather have synchronize_irq() be uber-safe. It's not like
it was used in hot path anyway.
Ben.
