Two of the specific arguments I've heard are (a) that the board (and
its hardware interfaces that the documentation would describe) involve
IP licensed from a third party, which the board manufacturer does not
have a legal right to disclose, or (b) that there is, in fact, no
suitable documentation, because the boards are developed somewhat
fluidly and the driver is developed directly from low-level knowledge
that simply isn't written down in a form suitable for passing on.
If you're building products with no expectation of supporting outside
driver developers, both of those are quite possible.
