Alan, would you accept the trivial version of per-user
CPU scheduling for 2.4 if there is a lot of demand ?
The code has been running in Conectiva's kernel RPM for
over a year now, is implemented entirely in the recalculate
part of the scheduler, leaves the scheduler fast path all
alone and only needs to be properly ported to newer 2.4
kernels now...
regards,
Rik
