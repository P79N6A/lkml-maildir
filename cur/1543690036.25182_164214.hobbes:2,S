vesafb ignore failures... for framebuffer it just prints warning only, and
for 0x3C0 region it just completely ignores warning (due to vgacon
clash). But it should not be serious, user should just get console 
on matroxfb, and vesafb on /dev/fb1 doing nothing.
Main thing which prevents this from working as users expects is that
modular fbdevs cannot be used by fbcon. So people cannot create
initrd scripts which load proper fbdev driver anymore, after detecting
hardware and making sure that hardware & user wishes & driver are
compatible. They now have to build fbdevs to the kernel, and hope for
the best...
