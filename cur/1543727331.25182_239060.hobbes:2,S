Oh, I guess you are suggesting actually copying args forward on stack 
before passing control to the probe routine. Hence the assembly 
trampoline.
What I had in mind originally was a little different - i.e. just 
make the kprobes breakpoint handler itself save the additional 64 KB 
from stack the way it does for pt_regs right now, before iret ing
into the jprobe handler function. And verify and restore that only 
if needed on the way back (i.e. second trap).
