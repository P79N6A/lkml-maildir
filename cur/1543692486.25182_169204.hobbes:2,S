And on what sort of hardware?
If you're writing your own ethernet-over-usb driver, perhaps the
problem is somewhere in that stack.  Either that ethernet driver,
or the one for your USB device controller could have the bugs.
The ethernet-over-usb driver in the "gadget" stack should behave
quite nicely.  It's the only network link on two systems I've
got running right now:  a net2280 on an NForce2 box (where 2.6
of course doesn't support the built-in ethernet); and a pxa255
(for nfsroot, MTD has acted broken on that hardware).  Neither
one has shown me the kind of un-usability problems you describe,
using either 2.4 or 2.6 kernels.  The network "just works", as
it should.  On the other hand, I'm not using Qtopia ... ;)
See 
http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget/
 for more information about
that stack, and the 2.6 kerneldoc for printable API reference.
