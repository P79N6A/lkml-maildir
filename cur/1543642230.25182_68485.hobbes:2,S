   Does the internal reiserfs nlink value translate directly
   to what stat() puts in st_nlink?
   
It really doesn't matter.  Even if you have some huge value that can't
be represented in st_nlink, you can report to the user that st_nlink
is NLINK_MAX.
This is one possible solution to this whole problem.
