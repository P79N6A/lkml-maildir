[ Mailed to PCI maintainer in October but no reply, so... ]
Not entirely important but since I sent the first, I'll send the rest of
the set.

Speaking of quirks changes:
        { PCI_FIXUP_FINAL,      PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82439,      quirk_triton },
./drivers/pci/quirks.c: if((pci_pci_problems&PCIPCI_TRITON)==0)
./drivers/pci/quirks.c- {
./drivers/pci/quirks.c-         printk(KERN_INFO "Limiting direct PCI/PCI transfers.\n");
./drivers/pci/quirks.c:         pci_pci_problems|=PCIPCI_TRITON;
./drivers/pci/quirks.c- }
That message isn't entirely helpful or descriptive of the actual effect
since my Bt878 does PCI->PCI DMA to my video card just fine.  The BUZ
driver is the only one that seems to care so it's not actually limiting all
direct PCI/PCI transfers, just that one device adjusts itself.

Not an entirely important matter though.
