Changing the rules would be easy, but you would need to make the
accounting check for root vs non-root and keep track accordingly. 
Admittedly not hard but not entirely pretty either.
I still contend the issues are not related.  It would make more sense to
me to do resource limits to solve this problem - rlimits are something
Rik has on his TODO and supposedly easy to add to rmap.
That way people can use strict overcommit, rlimits, neither, or both to
meet their needs.
