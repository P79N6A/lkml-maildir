I wouldn't dare!  No, look again, it doesn't back it out, it refines
it to refer solely to page_add_anon_rmap, page_add_file_rmap is not
relevant here - your fixup was that the original comment still said
page_add_rmap after that had been replaced by anon, file variants.
What was not intentional was having two rmap 24s:
this was the real 24, and the pte_young one should have said 25.
