It was changed to memmap= I thought.  The command line suggested above, for 
example, WILL NOT boot with any correctly operating boot loader. 
Unfortunately, given its history I suspect GRUB is nowhere in that category.
I think telling people to use memmap= instead of mem= is the only sane way to 
deal with this.
What is even more puzzling is that the command line used by the user in that 
question is bogus, and should be *exactly* identical to "mem=512M", but the 
bug report indicates that doesn't work on that machine.  Thus, there is 
something more seriously wrong.
