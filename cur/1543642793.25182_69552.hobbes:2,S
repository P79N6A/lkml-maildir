	I can only promise you to put it in my patch queue (which is
already backlogged). I've already added it on my web page (so I won't
forget it). It would have been nicer to not add a space around the
function name, but who cares.
	Please also note that currently irtty is broken, so use at
your own risks...
	Thanks...
