how exactly are you "triggering" the high CPU load?  i.e. what is the 
server doing?  file-sharing?  NFS?  CIFS?  something else?
i have LOTS of IBM xSeries servers (IBM x335, x345, x440), all of which 
have Broadcom BCM 5700 (tg3) NICs.
i drive them all at wire-rate gig-e with iSCSI.
i'm yet to see any 'excessive' CPU load associated with tg3 relative to 
tigon2 (AceNIC2) and Intel e1000 NICs.
cheers,
