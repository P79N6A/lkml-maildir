Sorry I'm a bit behind on the list, but this is going to conflict with
the random.c changes in -mm, where all the network-specific bits were
moved off to net/.
I'm not against adding a generic fast PRNG here, but this way is
backwards. Let's instead make a new function get_prng_int() and
convert the network bits to use it.
