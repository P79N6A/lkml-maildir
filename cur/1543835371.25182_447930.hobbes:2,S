well, i'd just call it a recursive rwsem. (sure, you can express it via 
condition variables, but just about any locking method can be expressed 
via them.)

the API is similar - behavior is different in that the 'per-cpu lock' 
i'm talking about _does_ allow preemption and migration to another CPU.
