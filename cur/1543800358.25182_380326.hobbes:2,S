With the mdb bench the following behaviour was observed:
(mem=128M)
- PageCache would fill zone_normal
- PageCache would fill zone_dma
- reclaim starts
- initially things look right
- after a while zone_dma is reclaimed so fast that it frequently gets a
full eviction (nr_resident == 0).
- from this point onward zone_normal practiaclly sits idle and zone_dma
goes wild with all the action.
