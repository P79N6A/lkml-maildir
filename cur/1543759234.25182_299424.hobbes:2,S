Sorry.
Problem is that pagedir is allocated as order-8 allocation on resume
in -mmX (and linus). Unfortunately, order-8 allocation sometimes
fails, and for some people (Rafael, seife :-) it fails way too often.
Solution is to change format of pagedir from table to linklist,
avoiding high-order alocation. Unfortunately that means changes to
assembly, too, as assembly walks the pagedir.
[Is it better now?]

Aha, okay, I guess I'll have to wait for resync between submitting
these. Forget the resume-from-initramfs patch...
(Or maybe Rafael is willing to create -mm version and submit it
himself?)
