I would agree with you if ACPI just supports PCI bus type, but ACPI
supports many bus types. We can't get an ACPI handler if only has a
'struct device'. You might say we can get its bus type from device->bus,
but we need a 'switch-case' to get what exactly the bus type is, but
this can't apply for loadable module bus type.
