I've seen similar behaviour with current 2.4 kernels with several nics
with different ip's in one subnet. The solution was to create an own
routing table for each ip (networkcard therefore) and to hammer static
ip-nic arp entries at the router before. Look at the advanced routing
howto for more information or write me a private email.
