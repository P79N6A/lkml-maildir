I'm not familiar with the IRIX model, but thought that the Solaris model
handled most of the stuff in a reasonable way. In the past, my observation
has been all things IRIX tend to be a little clunky.
Is the IRIX model DDI/DKI? 
The Solaris model is nice in that it also documents the race conditions that
you can get into between open, attach, and unload. They currently have
PCMCIA support. They have configuration files for each device.
I wouldn't want to copy all facets of the implementation. It is very
annoying that you have no way of controlling the instance number assigned to
a device. Since you usually use the instance number as your minor number,
this can cause some headaches.
