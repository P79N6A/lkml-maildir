Jeff Garzik and others have talked about unifying the network driver's
debug statements and levels with a common set of macros and level
values.  I want to do the same thing with the USB drivers, but was
waiting for them to finalize their scheme first (and hopefully use the
same thing.)
So yes, I think there can be some kind of "standard" debugging macros,
but the "standard" will probably be limited to a subset of the kernel.
