Aehm, sorry but the logic is bogus. A routed packet will be sent out this
interface with a foreign IP as source, too. Though nobody will want to send an
arp request with a foreign ip as source.
But you say here: Just as I can send out a packet with IP X from that interface
I can send out ARP request with same source.
Obviously you don't want that.
So you cannot step from A to B in your logical chain here.
Again. I'd like to stress I don't want to insult you or anything. The simple
thing is this: there are a lot setups out there that could benefit from your
tolerance in this issue. Can't we simply take the issue to the point: "you are
right, but you show tolerance for boxes that are not completely wrong" ?
I mean the world is full of people that are right and intolerant, so that in
fact doesn't really make them special ...
Please let us keep in mind that joe-average-user cannot handle complex setups
with arpfilter, arp_filter or anything the like. But he can right away enter
IT-superstore XYZ and buy a brand new router box for 20 bucks. If he is unlucky
(and you stay intolerant) he will for sure _not_ blame this box but his desktop
linux if things don't work out as expected.
I think we should at least make a minimum effort to keep things simple (and
explainable to joe-average-user), even if the background is complex.
Everywhere we have a solution for a problem that is overly complex, we will
fail to gain a broad market share, because there may very likely be easier
solutions under <name-some-os> _and_ we attract support problems for all
distributors.
Regards,
Stephan
