I don't think it's as bad as you describe. Once you have a free reference
DSL it shouldn't be very difficult to vary it for specific
platforms. I guess that is what the proprietary BIOS writers are doing too. 
Some systems have very complex ACPI tables, but for others they 
can be quite simple and a lot of the complexity can be just ignored.
I suppose you could even write a generic translator from mptables to ACPI 
tables (although I suspect more and more setups cannot be described
in the old tables) 
BTW there are other reasons now to support ACPI, like the MCFG tables
that are needed for extended config space accesses (necessary
e.g. for PCI Express error handling) or the HPET table for the HPET timer.
