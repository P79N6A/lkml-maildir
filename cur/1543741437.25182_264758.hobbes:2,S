This won't work very well for some cases. e.g. on AMD x86-64 the 
IOMMU is flushed by setting/clearing a bit in PCI config space.
AGP implementations work similar. You really don't want to track
all these flushes, it would be far too costly.

That could be fixed I guess?

In this case it would be IMHO better to have specialized suspend/resume
functions in the drivers for these oddball devices.
Most likely they will require some special handling anyways
(like special delays etc.) that can't be done by the generic code

I didn't get that one.
