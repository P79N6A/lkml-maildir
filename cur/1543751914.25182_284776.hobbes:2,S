i see problems with the clock after doing an acpi suspend. the
hardware clock is more or less okay (within a few minutes of the real
time anyway, nothing that ntp can't take care of) but the system time
is way off. this first started happening with 2.6.10-rc1. by now i've
gotten into the habit of running 'hwclock -s' by hand after each
resume. not really sure what changed and what i can do to debug/fix
this. for all it's worth i am running debian unstable.
