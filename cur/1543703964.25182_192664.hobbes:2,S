I'm curious is the people seeing this problem happen to have preempt
enabled in their config.  I've noticed that my laptop, which also
happens to have a tg3 based 10/100/1000 card, uses tons of CPU during
trasfers, but only when preempt is enabled.
After looking into this, my Aironet wireless has exactly the same
problem.  When preempt is enabled a simple scp transfer running at
approximately maximum speed for 802.11b (7.5Mb/sec) uses almost 70% of
the CPU.  The tg3 driver doing the same scp at 40Mb/sec (100Mb ethernet)
uses > 90% of the CPU.
However, turning off preempt and my system runs at approximately the
same speed on wireless (7.5Mb/sec) but only about 5% CPU.  The tg3
driver with preempt disabled allows the scp to run at near wire speed
(95-100Mb/sec) and uses only a fraction of the CPU.
Just curious if this might be what others are seeing.
Later,
Tom
