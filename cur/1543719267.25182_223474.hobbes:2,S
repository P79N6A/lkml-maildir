Not aborts, more like this every so often:
rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (598189175 bytes read so far)
rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(189)
rsync: writefd_unbuffered failed to write 4092 bytes: phase "unknown": Broken
pipe
rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(666)
Mirroring from sunsite.uio.no onto a Dual Xeon with a 1.6TB SCSI RAID 
(hardware) array, connected via GigE to a Cisco 4507r GigE switch., using the 
following rsync command:
rsync -av --stats --progress --bwlimit=2000 \ 
rsync://sunsite.uio.no/Mandrakelinux .
