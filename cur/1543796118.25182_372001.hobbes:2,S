I've been able to pin point the time of the fault to changes commited to 
v4l cvs at "2005-10-17 16:02."
In summary:
cvs as of 2005-10-17 16:01:
Analog TV works, as well as composite and s-video.
Changes made at 2005-10-17 16:02: bROKEN!!
cvs as of 2005-10-17 16:10:
Analog failes, s-video and composite work.
To test this, fron v4l-dvb/ ( not v4l-dvb/v4l/ ):
cvs up -D "2005-10-17 16:02"
make distclean
make
make install
Do a cold boot, and test.
cvs up -D "2005-10-17 16:01"
