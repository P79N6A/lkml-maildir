I now tested 2.6.20-rc4 with the following two commits reverted:
43cb76d91ee85f579a69d42bc8efc08bac560278
"Network: convert network devices to use struct device instead of
class_device"
40cf67c5fcc513406558c01b91129280208e57bf
"Driver core: remove class_device_rename"
I can now unload ohci1394 again while eth1394 is loaded. The reverting
patch is available at
http://me.in-berlin.de/~s5r6/linux1394/work-in-progress/revert-network-convert-network-devices-to-use-struct-device-instead-of-class_device.patch
(The server may be briefly down tonight and sometime during tomorrow.)
Next thing to do: Find a minimal fix which keeps Greg's net conversions.
