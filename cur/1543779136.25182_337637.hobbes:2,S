I was precisely modifying mii_chip_table[] in sis190-120 to make it work ;-)
Yes, that new version works well.
#dmesg
sis190 Gigabit Ethernet driver 1.2 loaded.
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:04.0[A] -> Link [LNKD] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:04.0 to 64
0000:00:04.0: Read MAC address from APC.
eth0: Realtek PHY RTL8201 transceiver at address 1.
eth0: Using transceiver at address 1 as default.
0000:00:04.0: sis190 at ffffc20000004c00 (IRQ: 11), 00:11:2f:e9:42:70
eth0: Enabling Auto-negotiation.
eth0: mii ext = 0000.
eth0: mii lpa = c1e1 adv = 01e1.
eth0: link on 100 Mbps Full Duplex mode.
By the way,  i still can not force speed/mode/autoneg (ethtool or mii-tool); 
ethtool reports correctly the changes, but autoneg is not really disabled, 
and the driver falls back to 100 Full...
Had Lars better results with autoneg off?
