hm, OK.  It could be that the debug patch is a bit too aggressive, or that
ppc got lucky and happens to always be in state TASK_RUNNING when these
calls to schedule() occur.
Maybe this task incorrectly has _TIF_NEED_RESCHED set?
Anyway, ppc guys: please take a look at the results from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.7/2.6.7-mm7/broken-out/detect-too-early-schedule-attempts.patch
and check that the kernel really should be calling schedule() at this time
and place, let us know?
Thanks.
