Well you could build a monilithic kernel with module loading turned off
entirely, but that doesn't prevent replacing libc which most programs
use to make those system calls.  Could make the filesystem readonly,
that would prevent writing a module to load into the kernel, and
replacing libc as long as you make it imposible to remount the
filesystem at all.
