What cause are you referring to? As far as I know, there are two options to
increasing the FSB clock.. one increases both FSB+PCICLK, the other just
increases FSB. If you increase the FSB only, it should keep PCICLK at a solid
33. (But I could be wrong, I've never tested that. I can tomorrow though.)

I don't have a KT7A personally, I only have a KT7. Can anyone else with a KT7A
verify this? By verify, I take it you mean to use idebus=33 and overclock
PCICLK? :) At least that would determine if UDMA100 is based on PCI or an
external 100MHz source.
