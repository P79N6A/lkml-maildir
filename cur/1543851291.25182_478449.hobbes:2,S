there probably is a different story going on.
When you unplug/replug AC power, several bioses change the meaning of
the software C-states in your system.
(there is a mapping between software visible C states and the hardware
C-states)
In some (hardware) C-states, the local apic timer stops (as does the
TSC), while in others it keeps running. If you change from AC to
battery, the bios can change the meaning of a software C-state from one
where local apic timer keeps going to one where it stops. This obviously
upsets the hrtimers/tickless code since that uses local apic timer for
event generation....
