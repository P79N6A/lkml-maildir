That's not really cheating - I think it's the right thing to do.
The whole "synchronous wait" thing is for historical reasons, and for VM's
that didn't throttle on their own. I actually think that _not_ waiting is
the right thing, because the new VM throttles when it thinks it needs to,
so other waiting is just going to hurt.
As long as interactive behaviour is fine under load, removing these hacks
is a _good_ thing, not a cheat.
