Sorry I have to disagree with that. The standard memcpy may change in
future to have different properties. If you really need specific unusual
properties then you want to be sure that it is obvious they are there.
I'd also like to see Dave's generic C implementation as I don't believe
you can create one the compiler isn't allowed at least technically to do
differently.
