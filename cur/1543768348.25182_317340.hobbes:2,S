Vivek,
kexec-tools-1.101 does not contain your last patch series (that includes
--crashdump which is lacking from the above cmdline). Currently you need
to patch up 1.101 with the stuff from 
[RFC/PATCH 5/17][kexec-tools-1.101] Add command line option
"--crash-dump" etc.
It would be good having a 1.2 or something with the patches included on
the site...
