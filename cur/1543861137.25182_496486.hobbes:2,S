I haven't seen that. What I did see is cache inconsistency when opening
the same file with different file descriptors when the filehandle changes.
My testing shows that at least fsync and close fail with EIO when the filehandle
changed while there was dirty data in the cache and that's good. Still,
not sharing the cache while the file is opened (even on a different file
descriptors by the same process) seems impractical.
