I will (re)work some part of the acpi_video stuff in order to make it
more generic (its design is to separate a kind of 'video bus', then
'video devices' can attach.  For now, its support only one kind of device,
the acpi one.  See acpi_viedo.c).  The original goal was to atleast
attach others acpi specific drivers (the toshiba at that time).
Problem though is my time which unfortunately is missing currently
(professional stuff, other free projects and even real life) and
I must admit I don't intend to work on acpi_video right now.
