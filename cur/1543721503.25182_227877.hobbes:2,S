I have the same problem, using a D865GBF, which is nearly the same 
board. BIOS is the most current version; booting with acpi=off allows 
the boot to proceed and function normally. I've tried rebuilding without 
"kernel IRQ balancing" and "register parameters" (which were my two most 
recent config changes), but no improvement.
