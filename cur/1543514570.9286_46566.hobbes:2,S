Hi all,
There seems to be a small problem with 2.3.24.
On 2.2.13, if you configure the kernel with Unix domain sockets as a
module, the system will pause for 5 seconds when init loads, and the
first message after that is the message that the sockets have been
loaded.
On 2.3.24, the wait is either infinite in length or longer than my
patience is.  This was causing me grief until I discovered it.
The solution, of course, is to compile Unix domain sockets into the
kernel.  But as big as the kernel is getting, I would think it better to
do it as a module.
Comments?
