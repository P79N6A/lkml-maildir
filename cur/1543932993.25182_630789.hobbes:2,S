bug was introduced via:
  commit 39743c9ef717fd4f2b5583f010115c5f2482b8ae

      x86: use raw locks during oopses
-               spin_lock_irqsave(&die.lock, flags);
+               __raw_spin_lock(&die.lock);
+               raw_local_save_flags(flags);
that is not a correct open-coding of spin_lock_irqsave(): both the 
ordering is wrong (irqs should be disabled _first_), and the wrong 
flags-saving API was used.
so this is a post-2.6.23 regression and the fix is (now) obvious.
