I don't understand the motivation for that requirement.  As long as the
server sends write opens to the server, and doesn't try to cache them
locally, I don't see why it shouldn't be left up to the server whether
to allow writes on a read-delegated file.

I think we could implement the correct NFSv4 delegation behaviour using
either lease semantic.
In any case, I haven't seen a real argument for reverting to the old
behaviour.  I'd rather see an established standard, or a correct
real-world application that fails, not just some arbitrary test.
