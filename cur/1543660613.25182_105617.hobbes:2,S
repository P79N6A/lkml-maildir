true, sorry for the noise
After ping -f i got
11:    1446896    1452624   IO-APIC-level  eth0
cat /dev/hda was not enought to "distribute" the interrupts it seems.
btw, ping -f hits 24000-29000 int. per second; adding
a cat /dev/hda slows it down to 20, 22000. Shouldn't
it redistribute the interrupts in a way you get > 29000?
(note that i've not idea of this thing)
