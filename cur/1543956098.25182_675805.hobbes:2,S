i fixed this in x86.git more than a week ago, see:

but since 64-bit resources never worked on 32-bit and the initiator 
regression causing this discussion turned out to be something else, i 
delayed this fix as .26 material.
the PHYSICAL_MASK fix looks good as an additional check - could you 
please resend it against x86.git/latest which has my fix already?
