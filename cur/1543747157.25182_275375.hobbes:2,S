Hi Sam,
   I've just finished porting Linux 2.6 to a new ARM board, that needs
a custom initramfs list.  My approach was to set
CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE to point to
"$(srctree)/arch/arm/configs/pleb2_initramfs" in the appropriate
defconfig for the board, as it's a default configuration item; but
Russell asks if there isn't a better place for a per-board default initramfs
script to live? 
What I'd like is for the appropriate default -- for this board --
script to be carried around and updated with the other configuration
files, somehow.
