PS:
The power conditions should be supported by many more devices besides
RBC devices.  Only SAT (and hence libata) and Linux' "File-backed USB
Storage Gadget" (drivers/usb/gadget/file_storage.c) have objections
against power condition.
But it's less intrusive if we enable it only for RBC for now because we
now have a good idea about how well it is supported by them.
