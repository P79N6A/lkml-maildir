Yes I mean atomic and per-cpu. Same as asm-generic.

How would seqlocks help?

This is exactly what mod_page_state does, which is what my patches
eliminate. For a small but significant performance improvement.

It is not a large change at all, just some shuffling of mod_page_state
and friends to go under pre-existing interrupts-off sections.
