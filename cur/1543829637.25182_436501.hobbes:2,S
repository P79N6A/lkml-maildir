The relationship is (and was) just that they share the pmu.h header file 
declarations. In the patch in question I used the powerpc definition as 
well.
The powerpc version exports pmu_queue_request (apparently for the use of 
low_i2c.c). The m68k version doesn't, but if it needed to export it, I 
don't see why it shouldn't implement the same "API"?
