Okay, Rik, the two extremes belong to you: one anon memory
object in total (above), and one per page (your original rmap);
whereas Andrea is betting on one per vma, and I go for one per mm.
Each way has its merits, I'm sure - and you've placed two bets!

For 2.7 something like that may well be reasonable.
But let's beware the fancy bloat of extra levels.

Wonderful if that code could disappear: but I somehow doubt
it'll fall out quite so easily - swapoff is inevitably
backwards from sanity, isn't it?
