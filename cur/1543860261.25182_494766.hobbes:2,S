Thing is, the platforms **DO** identify them as integers.
Go through OMAP, PXA, StrongARM chip docs ... what you see is
references to GPIO numbers, 0..MAX, and oh by the way those map to
bit offsets within gpio controller banks.
When they don't identify them as integers, as with AT91, AVR32, and
S3C -- all of which present GPIOs as a lettered bank plus a bit offset
within that bank, isn't that structure familiar -- then the Linux
platform support already #defines them as integers.  The naming matches
chip docs, the _numbering_ works much the same as on OMAP, PXA, etc.
Fortunately, only OMAP1 seems to have that ugly many-to-many mapping
between chip pins and GPIOs.  On other current platforms, once you
know the GPIO number you know the pin, and vice versa.  (That does
not matter to drivers at all -- only board setup code talks "pins",
everything else talks about functions such as "GPIO" -- but hairy
board setup code can be a frelling HUGE time sink/waste.)

If some system wants that kind of infrastructure, it can easily
implement it behind this API.  There's the IDR infrastructure, for
example, to allocate integers and map them to "more than int" data
for internal uses.
I could very easily imagine platforms that support the spinlock-safe
accessors for the SOC-integrated GPIOs, e.g. numbered below N, and
have a more dynamic "plug in your own external GPIO controller" way
to support GPIOs on i2c expanders, multifunction chips, and suchlike;
with that plugin stuff built over IDR and structures with ops vectors.

The reason for "silently ignored" is that we really don't want to be
cluttering up the code (source or object) with logic to test for this
kind of "can't happen" failure, especially since there's not going to
be any way to _resolve_ such failures cleanly.
And per Linus' rule about BUG(), "silently ignored" is clearly better
than needlessly stopping the whole system.
And for spinlock-unsafe cases, like I2C based GPIO expanders;

Me either.  Folk said earlier they want an API that can get/set
both types of GPIO, mostly to support userspace tweaking/config APIs,
but the only way I can see to have one of those is to include a
predicate like gpio_cansleep() to distinguish the two types.

Nope.  Such a type would likely get in the way of lowlevel IRQ

Good point -- it _might_ be valid to do that, on some platforms.
Such things have been used as a software IRQ trigger, which can
make bootstrapping some things easier.
That's not incompatible with it being an error for portable code to
try that, or with refusing to check it so that those platforms don't
needlessly cause trouble!
If I submit a patch against 2.6.20-rc2-mm1 to address Russell's
dislike of irq_to_gpio() calls (as yet un-explained), I'll try to
remember to mention this platform-specific issue.

That's not tristate.  An example of wire-OR would be a signal that
any of three different sources could drive high, but nobody drives
low (except an external pulldown).  Contrariwise, and maybe much
more common because it's what I2C does, is a signal that any source
can drive low, but nobody drives high (except one external pullup).
In both cases, drivers can notice an interesting case:  the value
they read from the pin doesn't match what they expected, meaning
that some other component is driving the signal.
Those kinds of mechanism support bidirectional I/O on one pin.
Examples include the I2C clock stretch mechanism, and also its
multi-master arbitration; and ISTR card address assignment with
pure MMC (if anyone really uses that in bus mode).
