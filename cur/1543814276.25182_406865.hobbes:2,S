As my memory comes back to me on this.  I also believe that Andrew  
asked me for size comparisons between a kernel using 32-bit start/end  
and 64-bit start/end on a 32-bit machine for a allyesconfig build.  I  
don't believe I ever got around to doing this or reporting the  
numbers to him.  It would be useful to have both code size  
differences and run time (if possible).
