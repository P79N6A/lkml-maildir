With what card(s)?

They may be known, but not by me.  I've fixed all the network drivers
to not call unregister_netdev() from timer context: I did that in
3.0.10.  I am unaware of other such problems: if they exist, let me
know, because otherwise, I'm not likely to do anything to fix them.
In Derrick's case, it turned out that he had only verified the bug
with the Wavelan IEEE card with a post-3.0.10 PCMCIA distribution.
This driver is not included in the PCMCIA package and hasn't yet been
updated to work around the problem.
