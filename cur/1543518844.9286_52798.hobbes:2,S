I think this is the last of the problems I have encountered.
This laptop uses a ricoh cardbus controller 
lspci -v

dmesg shows:
Intel PCIC probe:

The laptop is an NEC Versa SX (pII 300).
I have a 3com cardbus 10/100 nic and a xircom pccard ethernet+modem33.6
card.
On the 3com card, ftping a file (184mb) at 100mbit causes an error.  Copying
that same file over nfs does not happen.   According to my hub, bandwidth
utilization is >40% (40 is as high as the hub's meter goes).  After the
error the system is frozen.  If I eject the card, I get an oops (Sorry,
can't copy it, it was so long that it went off the screen and the system
wouldn't respond to scrolling).  No oops's are in the log unfortunately.
Here's the error:
eth0: Host error, FIFO diagnostic register 0000.
	This message repeats 21 times
eth0: Too much work in interrupt, status 8003.  Temporarily disabling
functions (7ffc).
The ftp and copy was done from the same file to the same directory.
On the xircom card, the system freezes when inserting the card.  No oops or
anything.  Ejecting the card does an oddity to the screen.  Column 1 starts
at the middle.  SysRQ doesn't work.  I tried using the pcmcia modules from
pcmcia v3.1.5 which had the same problem.  pcmcia 3.1.1 worked with this
card.
