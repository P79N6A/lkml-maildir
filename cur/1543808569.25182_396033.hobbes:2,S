OK, talking to myself (testing, testing, 1-2-3) - I have resolved this
issue after spending 2 hours trying to get my Mic to work again in
Teamspeak (why is there _so_ many frigging mixers
(alsamixer/amixer/aumix/kmix/arts) that all seem to do different
things...
I updated alsa-lib and alsa-utils to1.0.11rc3/rc2   This fixed my issues.
Now the question - there have been a lot of alsa changes (since my
alsa-tools was built Slack 10) - do we need to keep the alsa tools and
stuff current too?
