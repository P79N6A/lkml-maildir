Hrm, in looking at the craziness that is sys_poll() for a bit, I think
it's the underlying f_ops that are responsible for not setting POLLHUP,
that is:
                        if (file != NULL) {
                                mask = DEFAULT_POLLMASK;
                                if (file->f_op && file->f_op->poll)
                                        mask = file->f_op->poll(file, *pwait);
                                mask &= fdp->events | POLLERR | POLLHUP;
                                fput_light(file, fput_needed);
                        }
and file->f_op->poll(file, *pwait) is not setting POLLHUP on the
disconnect. What filesystem is this?
On an independent note, it seems like the relatively recent cleanups to
sys_poll() made the negative case a bit inefficient (and reliant on
msecs_to_jiffies() dealing with negative values, which I don't think it
was really ever designed to (it's mostly used for converting time
values, which can never go negative)). Maybe the following would make
sense? Peter, I know you had been looking at poll() issues earlier, does
this change make sense?
Description: Rather than make msecs_to_jiffies() deal with negative
values, just send them on to do_sys_poll(), which (eventually in
do_poll()) explicitly checks for them.
