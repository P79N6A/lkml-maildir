Subject: [GIT] kbuild fixes that needs some testing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I plan to ask Linus to pull kbuild-fixes.git soon as it reverts the
commits that introduces the problems with distcc, too large modules etc.
The pull request are below.
I has been in the work for too long but as my current setup
is br0ken(*) then I need someone to pull the tree and check
if it builds etc.
I had hoped to find time to test this myself but thats not this week.
(*) Motherboard on my primary linux box is dead and the box I use
    atm is far away from decent...
