    It can be called BUG ONLY if you can show some POSIX specification where
    said that true(1) and false(1) must ignore any arguments. Till not shown
    otherwise it's FEATURE. You can like or dislike this FEATURE but you can
    not clain that it's BUG !
Hmm - probably I shouldnt answer, but now that I have POSIX.2 here next to me:
4.23 false:
Options: None.
Operands: None.
Exit Status: The false utility always shall exit with a value other than zero.
Since GNU false sometimes does `exit 0' it certainly is not POSIX compliant.
