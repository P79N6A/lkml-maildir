Just a general thing, try to avoid having two identifiers that are
near-100% identical.  As seen in this thread, they are _very_ easy to
confuse.
Ime, there are two methods to avoid this.  One is to make the
identifiers longer, something like "map_seek_wqe_size" and
"map_read_wqe_size".  The other is to make them shorter, just "s" and
"r" is less confusing than the above.
Which method works best depends on many things, including personal
taste.
