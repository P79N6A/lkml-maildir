That is almost what I initially thought:
UPID=`ps -C uhci-control -o pid=`
(if all column heads are empty, no header line is printed)
It isn't perfect though. There is currently no way to exclude
processes that non-root users are running.

SPARC and i386 users should get the newer code. Other users should
use the old code or make sure their libc does sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF)
correctly. (It may NOT return 0. It could return -1, but only a poor
implementation would ever do so.)
BTW, see common.h if output looks terrible with glibc 2.1.
Getting back to the kernel... we seem to lack proper sysconf() support.
The i386 libc does slow and nasty things with /proc/cpuinfo.
