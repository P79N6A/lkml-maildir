The latest binutils has new .cfi_* mnemonics in gas that make writing such a table
much cleaner and easier. My plan was to use that. It would require new binutils,
but make future mainteance much easier. When people don't have the new binutils
it can be defined away.

On x86-64 it is unfortunately more complicated because it has a separate interrupt
or exception stack. The backtracker has to read the old stack pointer from the 
frame. This can be expressed in dwarf2, but is a bit tricky.
