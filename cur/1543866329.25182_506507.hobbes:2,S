In my opinion, the first way of writing it is the way to go. I've not
seen it put like the 2nd or 3rd way anywhere in the kernel (of course I
haven't read all of the code), and while it's correct, it's less
readable. I don't think gcc would generate different code between
variant 1 and 2, and anyway, this is called once at module init/exit
time, so whether you save 10 cycles there or not is totally insignificant.
