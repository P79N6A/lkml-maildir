That step is _temporary_ if the extra usages are accepted.
Also, I reported (changelog of patch 03/14) a definite API bug you get if you 
don't distinguish VM_MANYPROTS from VM_NONLINEAR. I'm pasting it here because 
that changelog is rather long:
"In fact, without this flag, we'd have indeed a regression with
remap_file_pages VS mprotect, on uniform nonlinear VMAs.
mprotect alters the VMA prots and walks each present PTE, ignoring installed
ones, even when pte_file() is on; their saved prots will be restored on 
faults,
ignoring VMA ones and losing the mprotect() on them. So, in do_file_page(), we
must restore anyway VMA prots when the VMA is uniform, as we used to do before
this trail of patches."

I know that problem. In fact for that we want VM_MANYPROTS without 
VM_NONLINEAR.

we must refine which pages to skip (the example I saw has only one guard page, 
if I'm not mistaken) but

Fairly better idea... It's just the fact that the original proposal was wider, 
and that we looked to the problem in the wrong way (+ we wanted anyway to 
have the present work merged, so that wasn't a problem).
Ulrich wanted to have code+data(+guard on 64-bit) into the same VMA, but I 
left the code+data VMA joining away, to think more with it, since currently 
it's too slow on swapout.
The other part is avoiding guard VMAs for thread stacks, and that could be 
accomplished too by your proposal. Iff this work is held out, however.
