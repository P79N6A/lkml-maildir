Subject: [PATCH] Uniquely identifying memory usage
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here is a really short patch that uses the proc filesystem to tell user
space what processes are share virtual memory.  I may have missed
something, but I don't think that there's currently any way to find out if
two processes are sharing memory or just happen to be using exactly the
same amount of memory.  The patch adds a /proc/*/mm_id that provides a
unique ID for memory usage.
The patch has one known issue that really ought to be solved if it
becomes actually a part of the kernel: It uses the process ID of the first
process to use a mm_struct as the ID for that struct.  This means that
under the following scenario, the scheme fails:
1. Process A is forked
2. A clones B with CLONE_MM
3. A exits
4. Process C is forked, and reuses A's pid.
Now B and C will share an mm_id despite the fact that they are not even
related to each other.  I didn't fix this because first of all, doing so
would require some way to keep track of free mm_ids, which might require
some extra kernel memory.  (Actually, if we use a bit mask it requires 64
bytes for the default NR_TASKS == 512, but I just thought of this a few
seconds ago).
Second, this situation won't ever actually happen under the only situation
most people use CLONE_MM, which is for LinuxThreads.  That doesn't excuse
the BUG, but it does mean that the patch is usable by most people until
the bug gets fixed.
Comments are welcome.  Since this is actually my first kernel patch ever,
is it considered good enough to just post a small patch like this to the
list, or should I put it on my web page somewhere?  I assume the list
archives are good enough?
