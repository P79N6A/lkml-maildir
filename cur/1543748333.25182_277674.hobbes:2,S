Yes, the "system" version of libsysfs is not always the same one that
udev wants.  Over the past year or so, sometimes it has varied a lot.
Hopefully now we are properly synced up, but I still trust our own
version, not any other version (this really matters on boxes that have
older versions of libsysfs, like SLES 9 and friends.)

Great.  Notice any code size savings?  Yeah, it's not really all that
much.  You also need static linking when using klibc to get a very tiny
udev for your boot initramfs image.

Will it still properly build with klibc?
Also, please realize that libsysfs is really not on many machines, due
to it only being used by 1 other program at this time.  So any memory
size savings is very limited.

Smaller size :)

I'm sure those who package up rpms of udev have dealt with this properly
somehow.  For the rest of the world, I'd prefer to keep the current way.
