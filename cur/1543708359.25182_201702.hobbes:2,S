Dear Dinesh,
The Red Hat 9.x kernels actually come with NPTL support builtin, as
such it shouldn't be necessary for you to switch to a 2.6 kernel.
However! Due to the obnoxious nature of you employer's email setup,
see below, I am providing you the above information under the contract
that you make sure to never post to linux-kernel again including the
below brain dead disclaimer and that you make sure to have your IT
department stop sending out such disclaimers. Disclaimers like these
are pointless and do not apply anyway as well as being obnoxious and
violates the spirit of public Internet email.
Using the above provided information for any NIIT business constitutes
acceptance of this contract between NIIT and the Linux community.
If you want to ask further technical questions, you are encouraged to
do so, but keep in mind that it must comply with this contract.
Best regards,
Jes
