Or all code.

Thanks.  There's another bogus comment doing the rounds as well:
#define _PAGE_FILE      0x040   /* pagecache or swap */
This is exactly wrong - this bit is used to distinguish pagecache from swap. 
See handle_pte_fault():
	if (pte_file(entry))
		return do_file_page(mm, vma, address, write_access, pte, pmd);
	return do_swap_page(mm, vma, address, pte, pmd, entry, write_access);
Some architectures got sneaky:
#define _PAGE_FILE  0x80000 /* pagecache or swap? */
ah-hah!  That question mark *totally* changes the meaning and reveals all.
Pity those who follow after us.  I shall fix it up.
