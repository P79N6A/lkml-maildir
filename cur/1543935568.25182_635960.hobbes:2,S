I notice that every driver in drivers/ata uses a .ioctl that points to
ata_scsi_ioctl().  I could add the BKL to that function, and then change
all of the drivers to .unlocked_ioctl, but I assume this would be a
candidate to actually clean up by determining why the lock is needed and
removing it if necessary.  Does anyone know off-hand the reason for
needing the lock (I assume someone does or it wouldn't have survived
this long)?  If the lock is absolutely required, then I can write the
patch to add lock_kernel() and unlock_kernel().
