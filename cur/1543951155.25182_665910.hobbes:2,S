This collides in non-trivial ways with the always-coming-never-arrives
r-o-bind-mounts patches.
I have an old version of those patches in -mm and I believe that Al
is/was/has set up some git tree with these patches and perhaps other stuff.
So some coordination is required please.  I'd suggest that if Al indeed
does have such a tree, he hand over the URL so I can get it into -mm and
that you then redo these patches on top of that.
Please also Cc Al and Christoph on these patches, as they are hitting files
which they maintain and develop.
Thanks.
