Sez who?  Realistically, most programs that display a list of
filenames and has "up one level" as part of the list (not all of them
do it that way) probably expect to get ".." in there to display this.

Doesn't have anything to do with sorting order or US-ASCII, it has to
do with readdir order.  If nothing else, it would be highly surprising
if "." and ".." weren't first; it's certainly a de facto standard, if
not de jure.
