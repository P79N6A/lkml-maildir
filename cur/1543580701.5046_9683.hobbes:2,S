I did not get the chance to deal too much with it, but apart from moving
functionality from userspace (ipcs) to kernel (ls), what were/could be the
benefits of /dev/shm ?. Can you create a shared memory segment by simply
creating a file there, or it is just a picture of what is in kernelspace?.
First time I saw that I thought: what could happen if /dev/shm is shared
in a cluster ? or, lets suppose that /dev/shm is a logical volume made by
addition of some nfs mounted volumes, one of each node, so one piece of
the shm fs is local and other remote...kinda DSM/NUMA...?
