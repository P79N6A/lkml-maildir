Ingo,
What's the reason for this printing out in cpu_idle?
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT
void notrace preempt_enable_no_resched(void)
{
	static int once = 1;
	barrier();
	dec_preempt_count();
	if (once && !preempt_count()) {
		once = 0;
		printk(KERN_ERR "BUG: %s:%d task might have lost a preemption check!
\n",
			current->comm, current->pid);
		dump_stack();
	}
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(preempt_enable_no_resched);
#endif
I can understand the above when using preempt_enable_no_resched, when
you know that you still have preemption on, but sometimes (as in
cpu_idle) it is used just before calling schedule.  So this check is
pretty much meaningless.

KR, 
Does your kernel boot without CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT?
