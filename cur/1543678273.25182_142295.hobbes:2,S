Aschwin,
It was two outputs as a point of proof.
When you see the patches on K.O you can download.
LKML is way to much into instant gratification, have a smoke or coffee.
I will get to in time, not like you are paying my salary, Boss.
I do this in my free time and when customers pay for product.
See one issue about me is I generally test the hell out of my code
changes.  Since I have only brought it up on two of 16 boxes, it is not
ready for primetime.
Storage is not a game, you do not recover well from corruption.
Since this patch is about timings and physical transport, I get edgy.
Cheers, and have a great weekend too.
