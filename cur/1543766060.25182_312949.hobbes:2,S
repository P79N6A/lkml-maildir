This doesn't help on my system.  I tried both ways: using boot option 
with nosmp, and rebuilding kernel with SMP off in config file.  
Using nosmp, I got:
IOAPIC [0]: Invalid reference to IRQ 0
.
.
audit(....) initialized
ide 1 : ....
id1 1 : ports already in use, skipping
and system halted
Rebuilding kernel with SMP off in config file, I got:
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on
unknown-block(0,0)
Thanks,
