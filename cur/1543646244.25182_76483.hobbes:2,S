Easy. I suppose it is binary compatible with 2.2.5.

Done.
Well, so you need:
- new binutils, easy to do.
- new gcc, already in Mandrake and RedHat (?? about SuSE and others)
- new glibc, probably the first update when Cooker and RawHide are
  unfrozen again. And it is a final release.
Problem is kernel 2.5. Too 'risky'.
I would like to ask again: could you state what new kernel features are
needed (futexes, cpu-affinity syscalls, signalling changes...).
Perhaps people can use 2.4 -ac or -aa trees (if for example nptl only
needs futexes).
TIA
