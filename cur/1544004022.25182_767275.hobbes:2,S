If you have radeon loaded but DRI was never enabled, you'll likely see a 
crash.  That's because the radeon driver doesn't map the registers it needs 
for suspend/resume at load time; they only get mapped by DRI initialization 
code which lives in the X driver.  There's a patch in 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11891
 that might help you...
