 Just a minor comment, can you break out the OPEN into at least
OPEN_R, OPEN_NONFILE_W and OPEN_W (possibly OPEN_A, but I don't want
that personally).
 The case I'm thinking about are network daemons that need to
open+write to the syslog socket but only have read access elsewhere.
 Also there is much more than just bind9 using capabilities, the
obvious ones that come to mind are NOATIME and AUDIT.
