I am having a strange problem.
I have a big daemon program to which I am trying to add multi-threading.
At the begining, after some sanity check, this program does a double fork to
create a deamon.
After that it listens for the client on the port. Whenever the client
connects, it creates a new thread using
pthread-create.
The problem is, the thread (main thread) calling pthread-create hangs
indefinetely in __sigsuspend. The newly created thread however, runs
normally to completion.
I wrote few test programs trying to simulate this behaviour but all of them
worked as expected.
Does anyone know, what's going on ??
