 add the AHCI legacy
support to sata_nv when IDE/RAID mode been set in SBIOS and Device IDs
are not in ahci.c at this moment. To do so, when a new chipset come
out and DIDs haven't been submited to LKML,user still can use ahci
driver to handle it when setting AHCI mode in BIOS, using sata_nv when
setting RAID/IDE in BIOS.
For example, ahci driver in Fedora 7 doesn't include the DIDs of
MCP78, so if you set the IDE/RAID mode in BIOS, os installation onto
SATA drive will fail. But if Fedora 7 include this patch, installation
will be successful.
