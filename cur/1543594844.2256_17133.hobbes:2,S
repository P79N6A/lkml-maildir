If patch was itself modified, the one big patch file could easily be
considered in terms of all of its smaller patches in any processing it
does as a publication aid.

The patch command already considers one large file to be a lot of
smaller patches in most cases. Why not, as it does its work, let it
document what it has done?

MySQL is just a sample. I mention it because it is quite easy to link a
web server to. Imagine patch running on a large file that is a
conglomeration of 50 small patches; it could easily summarize this, and
storing it through MySQL adds a lot of increased web flexibility (such
as searching and sorting). It is, however, just one example of a way to
make "patch" become autodocumenting.
