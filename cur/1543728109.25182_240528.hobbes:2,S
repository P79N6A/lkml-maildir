I can get a very small amount of register state out of POD but most of
it is clobbered by trapping with the NMI/MCA I send from the L2 to get
into the POD (Prom Only Debugger), and it's not entirely clear what may
have been clobbered in this process. The state I can extract from this
is very difficult to interpret. It's unclear how well the consolidated
L2 console (a.k.a.  firmware console) and machine console interoperate
with e.g. kgdb and the like. I might as well try that, too.
It's unclear how much of the progress I can track without the serial
console as there are no other output devices besides the serial console.
I'll try it anyway, since the worst that can happen is a boot where it
crashes.
