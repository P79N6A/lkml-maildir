And now all existing binaries that use the KDGKBDIACR ioctl
dump core? And all existing binaries that use the KDSKBDIACR
ioctl do very strange things?
If you want to do something like this, a new ioctl and a new
structure are necessary. If you design something new, keep
examples like Vietnamese in mind (with several accents on
one symbol). We do support that now in the 8-bit world,
but complete support of the 16-bit world still requires
some work. (And in the meantime Unicode has already gone beyond.)
