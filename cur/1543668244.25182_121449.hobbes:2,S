Subject: 2.4.21-pre6: mmx_memcpy not properly exposed to modules with Athlon

I've had a good deal of trouble this evening trying to compile
2.4.21-pre6 for the Athlon processor.  It appears that when the
kernel's bzImage is built all is well, but building modules (for USB)
results in unresolved references to _mmx_memcpy in the modules.
From looking at the System.map file and nm vmlinux, it appears that
the _mmx_memcpy symbol is present and presumably thereby linkable.
I'm not certain why that symbol is not being resolved when I try to
depmod or insmod the USB modules.
I was able to work around the problem by building the bzImage for
Athlon, then doing a make config to switch the processor type to
PIII/Coppermine before building the modules, so that memcpy is not
#define'd to refer to _mmx_memcpy, but this is not a terribly
satisfying workaround.
