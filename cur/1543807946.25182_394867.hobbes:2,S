Hello list,
Hope I'm not gonna drag up a dead horse or so, but since I recently acquired a 
laptop with NX support, I was wondering if in the end it made it into the 
kernel, or newer patches are available to test it out.
The only reference I seem to find is at 
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/nx-patches/
but this dates from 2.6.7, which is about half a century ago. ;)
Thanks,
Jan
