Yes.  The unlock happens at either nfs4xdr.c:1280 (ENCODE_SEQID_OP_TAIL)
or nfs4xdr.c:2534 (nfsd4_encode_replay()), and in the former case the
unlock is conditional on the value of the oc_stateowner field that's set
before the nfs4_lock_state() in nfsd4_open_confirm().
So while I believe the code as it stands is correct, it's not just your
checker that's going to find this confusing!  I'll work on a fix....--b.
