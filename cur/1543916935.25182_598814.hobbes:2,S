ATA spec says "The device shall return command aborted if the device 
does not support the Power Management feature set." Whereas TEST UNIT 
READY is required for SCSI. It seems the SAT authors didn't consider 
this case.
I assume we can tell from the identify data that the device doesn't 
support power management and just fake success for TEST UNIT READY in 
this case?
