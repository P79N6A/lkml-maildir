Hi,
Can anyone tell me if they have been able to run linux (any kernel)
successfully on a Profusion based machine? (eg IBM Netfinity 8500,
Compaq ProLiant 8000 or 8500, Dell 8450).
None of the websites mention linux support, I was curious if patches
were needed/available. I have had a look in the 2.3 tree but haven't
spotted any references to the chipset.
I haven't got one on hand to try unfortunately, but if it is known to
work, we might be getting one :)
Please CC me any replies in case I lose you in the flood that is
linux-kernel!
Thanks,
 Stephen.
