I really, really hate to have to post this to the linux-kernel mailing
list and annoy everyone with my troubles, but I fear I have no other
choice: a few questions, simply.
1) I've been searching around for the ALi M1541 chipset drivers(patch) for
the Linux kernel.  I've seen few sites and all of them either outdated or
moved without a reference to new homes.  Is it true that there *really* is
a driver out for this chipset, or am I totally scr*wed?
2) If I am, you know, then is ALi M1541 support planned for the
2.3.x/2.4.x kernel series?  If not, anyone know of a simpler way of
obtaining tech. specs on the chipset from Aladdin (that is ali, right?)
instead of just emailing/phoning them and asking for the docs?
Thanks for your guys' help :)
Chuck
