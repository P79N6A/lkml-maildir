Subject: fork() crashes on child but returns success on parent

Now I know for sure that the child crashes (SIGSEGV) before fork() returns.
I could see it in the UML debugger.
It does not use the signal handler I have set up of the SIGSEGV. It simply
crashes and exits.
Could this be any kernel problem ?
Any ideas what should I do next to track this problem ?
