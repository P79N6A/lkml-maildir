Actually this way of _communication_ is better because the maintainer has -
a) at least seen the bug
b) made it clear upfront that he/she is not in a position to fix it and
c) not inflicted a huge amount of follow up work for the reporter
while giving no hope that it will be fixed.
There is not much you can do if the maintainer feels he/she can't do
anything - apart from fixing it yourself which has its limits.
So the best that can be done is to communicate it clearly - that
happens in this case.
Compare the above to -
* Reporter reports a bug.
* People in position to fix it  have no care for it and they show it
(By not even looking at it).
* Significant amount of time passes with no activity.
* Reporter receives a automated mail (bonus insult) - New release is
available, please retest with new release and open a new bug if the
problem still exists.
* Bug is closed
* Bug still exists in next release - reporter knows only when he/she
gets a chance to upgrade to next release (not always easy/possible).
