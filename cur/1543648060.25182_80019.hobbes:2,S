That precisely is the reason. The bad news is that system crashes when agpgart 
and radeon are compiled as modules, and the good news is that I am unable to 
crash it when they are not.
Mainline (2.4.20-pre10) is stable when agpgart and radeon are compiled as 
modules.
The problem is much easier to reproduce than I thought, just log in and log 
out of XFree86/Gnome few times (3 or more times in my case) is more than 
adequate to crash it.
Here is the .config which is stable in -aa1:
CONFIG_AGP=y
CONFIG_AGP_AMD=y
CONFIG_DRM=y
CONFIG_DRM_NEW=y
CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=y
Here is the .config which destabilises the -aa1 kernel:
CONFIG_AGP=m
CONFIG_AGP_AMD=y
CONFIG_DRM=y
CONFIG_DRM_NEW=y
CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=m
Unfortunately system just reboots without leaving oops information in the 
system logs. If you want I can try few older versions of -aa to find from 
when it started happening.
Thanks for your help.
