That patch depends on 3 of the previous 4 patches.  Taken together I
doubt they meet the criteria for 2.6.11.x.
It's probably possible to write a shorter and more obvious one-off fix
just for that tree, but I'm not sure it's worth it for a bug that, while
it's obviously extremely annoying for some workloads, doesn't quite
reach the level of, say, a root exploit.
