It is problem with Debian's glibc, it is compiled with 2.2.x kernel
headers. I filled bugreport against this few weeks ago, but it was marked
as inappropriate because of Debian glibc is built against newest
kernel-headers package, and newest kernel-headers package is still 2.2.x.
Maybe someone (you) should fill bug against kernel-headers or kernel-source
to get 2.4.x into Debian. Then Ben Collins (Debian glibc maintainer) can 
recompile and officially release glibc compiled against 2.4.x kernel.
                                                Best regards,
