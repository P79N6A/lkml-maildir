Subject: What happened to CONFIG_TCP_NAGLE_OFF?

I would like to globally disable nagling on my (2.6.9) system.  There
are several references on the web to the CONFIG_TCP_NAGLE_OFF kernel
config option.  However, it appears as though this no longer exists.
How might I achieve having TCP_NODELAY effectively set for all sockets
(by default)?  Is there a new/different kernel config option, a patch,
a sysctl or proc setting?  Or can I "fake" this behavior by, e.g.
setting a send buffer sufficiently small?
Thank you,
Matt
