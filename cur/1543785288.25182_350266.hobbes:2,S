One other point to look at is whether fragmentation is due to pinned
dentries or not. We can get that information only from dcache itself.
That is what we need to acertain first using the instrumentation
patch. Solving the problem of large # of pinned dentries and large # of LRU 
free dentries will likely require different approaches. Even the
LRU dentries are sometimes pinned due to the lazy-lru stuff that
we did for lock-free dcache. Let us get some accurate dentry
stats first from the instrumentation patch.
