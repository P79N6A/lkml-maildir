    I don't understand how you could possibly say this. Any 
application that was using an RTOS does so because it has 
requirements that must be met. Switching from an RTOS to a non-RTOS 
means that you can't provide those guarantees anymore, which is a 
significant side effect.

    You can't do everything in hard wired hardware and wouldn't want 
to for a large variety of reasons. Hardware is hard to change, hard 
to validate, and hard to test. You're much better off sticking with
generic, well tested, well understood hardware. However, you *must*
use an RTOS. Different job, different tool.

    Probably so, but we weren't talking about "Linux+RT", were we?
Trust me, any real RT code for Linux will cause its performance to 
drop significantly. There will be constant checks for pre-emption, 
for example. (Disclaimer: I'm not familiar with what RT stuff is 
available for Linux. I'd be only too happy to discover it's really 
good and doesn't significantly affect performance.)

    No, I've never used vxWorks, I just understand the difference
between an RTOS and a non-RTOS and how to choose the right tool for
the job. If an application can run on an OS that is not an RTOS, it
almost always does. RTOSes are usually used where you *must* *have*
guarantees.
    It is extremely handy for many problems to be able to guarantee
that you can turn the pump on within 13 milliseconds without having 
to hard wire a specific circuit for that. This is the problem domain
RTOSes were meant for. This has inevitable overhead. If you need to
meet specific time requirements, then the overhead is a low price to
pay.
    Most applications that require RTOSes don't need a lot of
computing. Controlling a nuclear power plant takes less CPU power 
than playing Solitaire on a GUI. A P3 can easily provide 13 
millisecond response time without breaking a sweat, but not running a 
general purpose OS. That doesn't mean we should all run RTOSes.
    That you would even dream of comparing the performance of an RTOS
to a non-RTOS as a way of comparatively evaluating two operating
systems suggests you don't understand what an RTOS actually is for. 
You're not alone, by the way, I once had a conversation with the 
product manager for a leading RTOS and quickly discovered he had no 
idea what an RTOS was either. He was under the misconception that 
real time means high performance.
	The truth is that an RTOS allows you to use generic hardware for 
cases that would otherwise require highly specialized hardware. The 
benefit is flexibility, maintainability, and reliability. Generally, 
the CPUs you use are at least an order of magnitude faster than the 
task actually requires, so you don't particularly care about 
performance.
