In case of the O2 the full story is a little more complicated.  The O2 is
not I/O coherent.  That's a well know and handled configuration for the
R5000.  But the R10000 which was never designed for such use will do very
stupid things such as actually performing speculative stores and scribbling
into DMA buffers left and right.  There are two possible workarounds for
this; one is software only the other is using a little CPLD codenamed Juice
on the O2 R10000 board and would require a special memory region for DMA
buffers, so the ZONE_DMA was really there as some sort of future proofing.
But in the end the same arguments as for the Lance apply here.
