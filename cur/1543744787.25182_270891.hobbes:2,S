Please post the contents of /proc/cpuinfo. The age
of this system makes me suspect it may not actually
have a local APIC (the first K7 model didn't have one).
If a previous kernel successfully found the local APIC,
then please state which one and post its boot log.
(And please use nmi_watchdog=2 so we can confirm that
it's there and working.)
