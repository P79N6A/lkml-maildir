I think it is possible, but then it will probably be back to something
like "pci=routeirq" philosophy.

ACPI is well organized and easily manipulated, that's why I stopped
right there. I tried adjusting the MPS case, it is possible, but then I
thought no one would need it anyway. It would take multiple changes and
won't be pretty, but if you insist I can work it out :)
