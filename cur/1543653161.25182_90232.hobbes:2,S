Scanning for a partition table is just one aspect.  In general, once a 
module has handed over it's entry points to some other kernel area those 
entry points should be ready for use, so blocking access to them isn't 
needed.  OTOH, when you are tearing a module down then you do want access 
to stop, so that's the proper time to set live == 0.

Yeah, that's fine for hotplug.  But, you know what, for PCI hotplug scsi 
this wouldn't even be an issue since a true hot plug event normally would 
be after module init is complete and scanning the table wouldn't be a 
problem then because module->live would be non-0 ;-)
