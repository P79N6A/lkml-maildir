Thanks for validating. 
I am embarassed to say I am still running version 0.7.0 - problem is i
have patched it semi-substantially to add features which i didnt get
much luck in pushing in; so i cant upgrade overnight.

Ok, maybe it is time to invest time to forward port my patches. I dont
see anything in the release notes between 0.8.2 and 0.9.0 which says
this problem was known and fixed in some specific version. Any pointers?
Thanks again - you saved me a lot of time.
cheers,
