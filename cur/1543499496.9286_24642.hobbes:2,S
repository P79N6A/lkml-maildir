	dynamic devices are good, and even if they aren't, there are lots of
them out there, and there's going to be more.  Personally what I would REALLY
like to see is the ability to remove/replace a scsi disk in a system while
the system is running.  Don't know if devfs supports it (Or PC hardware in
general, but I think it does).
	This would assist me greatly in keeping servers up and happy and
handling user requests.  That ability, and raid0+1 make a powerful
combination for very high reliability.
