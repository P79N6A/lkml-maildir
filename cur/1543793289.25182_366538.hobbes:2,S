The subject line speaks for itself.   This is using standard VFS readdir 
and lookup calls through the VFSwith ftp.  Very poor. 
It appears dcache related since longer file names proportionately take 
longer based on the size of the name.  My lookup routines use static 
pinned tables in memory, and are very fast.  VFS peformance non-ftp are 
reasonable, but still have problems with the number of entries
in a directory gets above 50,000.
