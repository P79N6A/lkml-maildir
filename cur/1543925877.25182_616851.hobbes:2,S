"somber"?
Why?
We (a number of the kernel developers) want to see the perfmon code make
it into the kernel tree, unfortunatly, in the current state it is in,
that's not going to happen.
Andi specified a way that this can happen, just refactor your patches
into smaller bits that can be reviewed and applied.
If you, or anyone else has any questions about this, please let us know.
So far, I have not seen any response to his message, so I'm guessing
that the perfmon developers either are off working on this, or don't
care.
And if they don't care, then yes, I agree with your "somber" feeling...
thanks,
greg k-h
