You should be able to compile psmouse as a module:
[root@core dtor]# grep MOUSE_PS2 /misc/arc/dtor/.config
CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2=m
You need to select it like this:
[*] Mice
  <M>  PS/2 mouse
and load psmouse.ko after USB has been loaded.
Alternatively you can try patch made by Vojtech to take over USB
system early, even before USB host controller driver is loaded:

(use "Download message RAW" link to get the patch).
