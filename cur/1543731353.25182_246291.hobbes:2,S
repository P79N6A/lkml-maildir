This might cause major problems on systems with virtually indexed
caches if precautions are not made at buffer allocation time such
that the virtual cache color of the kernel mapping is the same
as the user mapping.
Arjan, you should know better :-)
I also don't understand what this "optimization" is?  You don't need
a verify_area, therefore you can use __put_user() which amounts to
a load/store and an integer move instruction.
