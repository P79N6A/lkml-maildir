    I'm trying to run 2.6.0-test1 on an alpha box, 
    and  apparently, the osf partition numbering is wrong:
    On this disk, I have c, d and e disklabels,
    which are seen by 2.2 and 2.4 as /dev/sda[345].
    But 2.6.0-test1 number the slides starting at 1...
    so in 2.2/2.4 my root  is sda5 and in 2.6, sda3. ouch.
    Is this an expected behaviour ?
Can you give some information? Output of fdisk -l and
dmesg | grep sda for 2.4 and 2.6?
