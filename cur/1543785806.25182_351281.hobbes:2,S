These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness and interactivity. 
It is configurable to any workload but the default ck* patch is aimed at the 
desktop and ck*-server is available with more emphasis on serverspace.
THIS INCLUDES ALL THE PATCHES IN 2.6.13.2 SO YOU SHOULD START WITH 2.6.13 TO 
USE THESE PATCHES
Apply to 2.6.13

or server version

*prefetching should still be considered experimental*
I appreciate the extensive testing it is receiving!

Split patches available.
Changes:
Added:
+vm-sp6_sp7.2.patch
Swap prefetching update. Locking problems caused bizarre slowdowns on smp, smt 
or preempt configurations. Locking has been extensively revised and hopefully 
all fixed. Very frequent testing of free memory is now also done as 
kprefetchd runs at low priority (nice 19) and it may be a while between each 
page prefetched.
+per-task-predictive-write-throttling-1.patch
Andrea's write throttling patch
