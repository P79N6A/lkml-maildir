It should use whatever the sr.c SCSI CD driver code uses when doing
CDDA, and it isn't directly a part of the driver (although there are
hooks so drivers can filter/control what ATAPI can be done with DMA).

I would be interested to know what happens if you try this, version
doesn't matter.

The core code sets both drives to the same speed on the cable. The old
-ac code fixed this but I've not pushed that change over (in part
because it will naturally happen now as other changes go in).
Thus dev1 is pulling dev0 down to UDMA33 for now.

That change is in the libata driver as well so should not be a problem.

Much appreciated,
