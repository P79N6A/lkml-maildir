How would you catch (common) the case of them having different bases in the 
GDT TLS entries? At some point the selector has to be reloaded, otherwise 
it won't be picked up by the CPU.
I think the original condition is correct. You could maybe merge it with the 
TLS entry rewrite and only do it if something changes there. Not
sure it is worth it though.
