Thanks for looking at the patch. Patch needed few cleanups to get it
working. Here is the status so far..
1) I tested synchronous raw read/write. They perform almost same as
   without this patch. I am looking at why I can't match the performance.
   (I get 380MB/sec on 40 dd's on 40 disks without this patch.
    I get 350MB/sec with this patch).
2) wait_on_sync_kiocb() needed blk_run_queues() to make regular read/
   write perform well.
3) I am testing aio read/writes. I am using libaio.0.3.92. 
   When I try aio_read/aio_write on raw device, I am get OOPS.
   Can I use libaio.0.3.92 on 2.5 ? Are there any interface
   changes I need to worry  between 2.4 and 2.5 ?
Once I get aio read/writes working, I will provide you the performance
numbers.
Thanks,
Badari
