If I didn't note it before, I'm read the the data from /proc, cpustats, 
net/dev, and diskstats. I assume that all i/o would show up in one of 
those places. NFS isn't involved, although this machine is a fileserver 
as a side job the modules weren't even loaded during testing.
A puzzlement for future consideration. If I get a chance later this week 
I'll make a pretty graphic of all the stuff going on when the iowait 
spiked, ctx rate, inq rate, hell the last time I even grabbed the CPU 
temp to see if it told me anything (didn't, thermal throttling NOT).
Thanks for the feedback, I think that lets out the obvious stuff.
