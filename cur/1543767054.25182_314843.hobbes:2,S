Maybe talking out of my ass here, but would it make sense to have the
generic syscalls in asm-generic, in the form of something like:
	SYSCALL(__NR_getpid, sys_getpid)
?
The arch include this into its syscall table, would continue to define
__NR_*, and it would define SYSCALL (but all the syscall tables I've
seen are just arrays of pointers).  This would allow the arches to
automatically get all the generic system calls, and they'd continue to
define on their own any arch-specific things.
