It certainly shouldn't, thats going to cause horrible device service
latency for high performance devices.

And these may change if there is good reason for doing so. The Linux
kernel does not guarantee a fixed set-in-stone driver API.

Well these systems have the problem that they have to keep third party
vendors happy. We don't since most of our code is included in the
public source, and the people who wants to do binary-only drivers will
have to live with that.

Sure there is, it is not worth the effort. There have been cases in
the past where the driver API had to change and there will be cases in
the future.
