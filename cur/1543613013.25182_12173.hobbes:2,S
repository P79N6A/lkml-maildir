After a few failed web searches (combos like 'linux cache color' just gave 
me a bunch of references to video), I am resorting to this list for this 
question.
What exactly do y'all mean by these "colors"? Task colors, cache colors, 
and probably a few other colors i've missed/forgotten about. What do these 
colors represent? How are they used to group tasks/cache entries? Is what 
they're actually for?
