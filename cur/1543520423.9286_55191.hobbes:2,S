Doh!  Ok, I need to learn more.  I take it this means recursive in kernel
is totally a bad idea then?
I can either try to deal with this dynamically by checking how much stack
is left, or just completely changing strategies to put all the dynamic
stuff in a growable heap chunk.  What do you recommend?
Doh doh doh...
BTW, what are symptoms of stack overflow?  Any pointers to required
reading here?  Thanks.
