My feeling is that there is too many numbers in the kernel version.  
I think 3 numbers are good enough to get people to try out (knowingly or
not).  So,
    2.6.{11,12,13,...} -- for testing (a.k.a. -rc, -pre)
    2.7 -- stable release
    2.7.{1,2,3,...} -- for testing
    2.8 -- another stable release
    ...
    2.125 -- when last IDE bug is fixed.
    3.0 -- stable release
    3.0.{1,2,3,...} -- for testing
    ...
