Subject: [PATCH 47 of 53] ipath - fix problem with lost interrupts on HT-400
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/12/370

We can have a race clearing chip interrupt with another interrupt
about to be delivered and can clear it before it is delivered on the
GPIO workaround.  By doing the extra check here for the in-memory tail
register updating while we were doing earlier packets, we "almost"
guarantee we have covered that case.
