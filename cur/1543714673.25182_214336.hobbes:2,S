Given that the driver currently supports only PCMCIA implementations,
I agree.  My thinking was if someone comes up with a host adapter that
isn't PCMCIA, the SYM53C500.c file is to the sym53c500_cs driver what
the qlogicfas.c file is to the qlogic_cs driver, that is, core functions
that could support multiple types of host adapters.  The logic to
handle the different types of adapters isn't there, and I don't know
that it ever will be (else, it's probable that someone would have
written the Linux driver long before now).  However, after baring my
ignorance to the world and saying I was unaware of non-PCMCIA
implementations, I found a FreeBSD driver for the NCR 53c500.  Never
say "never," I guess...  Your opinion counts for much, but you're the
only person I've heard from.  Is there a consensus I should forget
about the non-PCMCIA cases?

I caught that in the coding style guidelines (and in the mentioned
include files), and will fix for the next submission.

Guilty as charged.  Functionally, there's nothing in the driver I
submitted that wasn't in the original.  Suggestions welcome...  Which
of the existing PCMCIA SCSI drivers do a proper job of handling
multiple host adapters in your opinion?  I'll try to adapt that code to
fit this driver.  If I have to "roll my own" from scratch, I'm probably
in over my head.

I'll see what I can do.
Although I touched on it above, by way of apology/explanation, the goal
for the initial port was to replicate the functionality I already had in
older kernel versions.  It appears I faithfully replicated the
deficiencies of the old driver as well :-).  Again, thank you for the
feedback.
Anyone else have input before I act on the recommendations I've been
given?  Unless I hear otherwise, I'll start work on the code
consolidation and removal of dependencies on deprecated include files.
The detection logic and handling multiple HBAs will take a bit more
effort...
