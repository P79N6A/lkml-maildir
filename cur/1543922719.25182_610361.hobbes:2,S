(yeah, but there were a truckload of other changes as well)
Looking at your data, _my_ first suspect would be the 2.6.22->2.6.23
futex changes.  I'd revert all of the changes to kernel/futex.c and
kernel/futex_compat.c, and see if the problem went away.  If it didn't,
I'd then do a full git bisect to nail it down.
