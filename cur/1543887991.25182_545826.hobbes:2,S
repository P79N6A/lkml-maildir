These allocations didn't have right to the memory they would otherwise
get. Also they will end up in the page allocator just like they normally
would. So from that point, its no different than what happens now; only
they will not eat away the very last bit of memory that could be used to
avoid deadlocking.

That would radically change the way we do reclaim and would be much
harder to get right. Such things could be done independant from this.
The proposed patch doesn't change how the kernel functions at this
point; it just enforces an existing rule better.
