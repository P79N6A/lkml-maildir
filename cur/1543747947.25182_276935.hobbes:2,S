What about this:
nice = x;		/* -20 to 20 */
ioprio = y;		/* -40 to 40 */
effective_ioprio = clamp(x+y);	/* -20 to 20 */
This would allow tuning processes for unusual contrasts with the ioprio 
call.
On the other hand, it would allow us to just brute force "adjust" a 
process with
the nice command in the usual way without any changes to the "nice" 
source.
I also thought of a different effective ioprio calculation that scales
instead of clamping:
nice = x;		/* -20 to 20 */
ioprio = y;		/* -20 to 20 */
effective_ioprio = ((ioprio<0)?(20+nice):(20-nice))  *  abs(ioprio)/20;
			/* -20 to 20 */
Cheers,
