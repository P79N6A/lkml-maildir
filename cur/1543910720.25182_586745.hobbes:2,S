There is another interesting angle to this: in the past, every time I
had keyboard problems, it used to be caused by the VFS and/or NFS...
after much wrangling, a bunch of bugs were fixed (Hi Trond, Peter,
Alan!).
Now, after the keyboard "locked up", I used the mouse to close the
gnome session, then I logged-in remotely to reboot.  The reboot
process locked up and I need to use the reset button!  The second
time the keyboard "locked up" I listed my processes, and I noticed
that I had a couple of bash processes and a ssh process in "D" state.
Something is fishy again in the VFS ;)
