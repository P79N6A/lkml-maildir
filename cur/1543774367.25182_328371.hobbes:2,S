No, I see the value of "atomicity", and think it is very useful. What I
don't see the value of is the making of premature claims.
_When_ reiser4 has atomic write(2), you have full right to call it
atomic, not before.
_When_ reiser4 is tested through objective benchmark-set exercising
various workloads, you can refer to these benchmarks as the proof of
reiser4 technical superiority, not before.
On a more personal note, I invested large amount of my time and effort
into developing reiser4, and I feel attached to it and to the great
ideas embodied in it. For reiser4 to rot on the forgotten shelf in
obscurity is the thing I want least. I want it to be included into
mainline kernel, but for this to happen, you have to take more realistic
stance towards err... reality.
