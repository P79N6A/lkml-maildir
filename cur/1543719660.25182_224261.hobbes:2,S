well define "h/w specific", just give me an example of a real (alsa?)
driver that would use it (or point me to one) so that I can see if this
is the best API, what the return value should be etc etc

I would be very wary of unconditionally doing the resume thing without
the driver having had a chance to do it's thing. Imo the driver HAS to
be able to override stuff or at least talk to the hw before the generic
resume happens.
