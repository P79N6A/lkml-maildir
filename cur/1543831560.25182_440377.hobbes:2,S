Maybe....
Now imagine what would be required to rebuild a whole drive onto a
spare after a drive failure.
I'm sure it is possible, and I believe ZFS does something like that.
I find it hard to imagine getting reasonable speed if there is much
complexity.  And the longer it takes, the longer your data is exposed
to multiple-failures.
There may well be room there to come up with a really clever idea that
makes it both flexible and fast....
Note that 'resync' wouldn't be a problem.  Having the filesystem know
about the raid means that resync (after unclean shutdown) can be quite
trivial (I believe there is a paper related to this at OLS this year).
