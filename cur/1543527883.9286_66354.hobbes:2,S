Feel free to do sanity checking.
But no config options.
Why?
I'm looking at the current patch, and I'm left wondering which magic
combination of options I would choose as a vendor. 
If one set of config options is not generally usable, then that set should
not exist at all. I refuse to have code that is complex _and_ conditional,
and for no apparent reason.
