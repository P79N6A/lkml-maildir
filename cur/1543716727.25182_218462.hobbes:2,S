The hub is a 10/100 one, and the 3 RTL8029 are 10 Mbps only.

No, because RTL8029 are 10 mbps only (they are BNC/RJ45 NICs).
But what I thought was that maybe, they were initialised as full duplex,
not half duplex. But again, I don't know where I can check that. I added
some printks and determined that the code used to init them full duplex
was never used. And there's no way to force them half duplex with this
driver.
