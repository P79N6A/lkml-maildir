I still think we shouldn't reward shit hardware by complicating
up our DMA mappings internals. :-)
If you're going to do it anyways, we use a nearly identical
allocation bitmap algorithm under sparc64 so maybe you can
take a stab at trying to put your code there too.  I'm more
than happy to test and integrate.
Thanks.
