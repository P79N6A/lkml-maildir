What do you mean by problems 5 years down the road?  The real issue is that
this 32-bit block count limit affects composite devices like MD RAID and
LVM today, not just individual disks.  There have been several postings
I have seen with people having a problem _today_ with a 2TB limit on
devices.
There is some hope with LVM (and MD I suspect as well), that it could
do blocksize remapping, so it appears to be a 4k sector device, but
remaps to 512-byte sector disks underneath.  This _should_ give us an
upper limit of 16TB, assuming 32-bit unsigned ints for block numbers.
Of course, you would need to only do 4kB block I/O on top of these devices
(not much of an issue for such large devices).
Still, this is just a stop-gap measure because next year people will want
> 16TB devices, and there won't be an easy way to do this.
Cheers, Andreas
