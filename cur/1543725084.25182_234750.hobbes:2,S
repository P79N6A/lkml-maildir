Hi all, apologies for posting here, but I need to ask the guys who know 
for sure. In my fstab, I have two entries for my DOS HD so I can mount 
it with or without CRLF mangling, as follows (sorry for the line splitting):
/dev/hda5   /d      vfat 
rw,suid,dev,async,users,umask=033,uid=1500,gid=1001,conv=b 0 0
/dev/hda5   /dc     vfat 
rw,suid,dev,async,users,umask=033,uid=1500,gid=1001,noauto,conv=a 0 0
I just noticed with my new Linux setup (kernel 2.4.20-8smp - don't know 
what all that means) that it will let me mount both at once, so I can 
see the partition as either /d or /dc at the same time. I may be going 
mad, but I seem to recall with my previous kernel that I couldn't do this.
My question: Bug or feature? If I write all sorts of stuff to both 
logical devices, will it correctly sort it all out on the same physical 
device, or will I wreck the partition? All help much appreciated!
