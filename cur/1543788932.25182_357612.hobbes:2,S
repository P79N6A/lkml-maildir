Umm, IIRC, some architectures (don't remember which ones, but I'd  
guess it's the big 512-way boxen) have cache-line-and-memory models  
such that a cacheline may remain out-of-date indefinitely unless the  
CPU with the update runs a "cache-line flush" instruction or the CPU  
who wants an update requests one with an exclusive cacheline lock or  
similar.  On such a system, the only way to ensure safe distribution  
of data between CPUs is to make sure it's in the same cacheline as  
the spinlock (and document that fact) or use special instructions to  
verify coherency.

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.   
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by  
definition, not smart enough to debug it.
