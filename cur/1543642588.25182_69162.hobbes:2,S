Ok that definitely would allow for more interrupts to get through, i was 
working on the basis that handlers with SA_INTERRUPT set would allow for 
for that reenable. About the driver level changes, would this be in regard 
to a device with ISR_INPROGRESS triggering an interrupt and thus have one 
pending? In that case couldn't we avoid touching the driver and increment 
a pending counter on that particular handler?

Gotcha

I'll have a look at those too.
