In your case you appear to have a bit-flip in inode->i_cdev (which
contains 0x00008000).  It could be pretty much any thing causing
that... but the locking in cdput is still suspect:
	void cdput(struct char_device *cdev)
	{
		if (atomic_dec_and_test(&cdev->count)) {
			spin_lock(&cdev_lock);
lets somebody else elevate the cdev->count before we get the lock, and
we'll proceed to destroy the cdev which is now in use again.
Al already fixed this for bdput, but it looks like we need

for cdput too (compiled but not tested).  I'm not 100% convinced this
is the problem you're seeing, though.
