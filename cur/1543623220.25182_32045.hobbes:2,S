You always have to unmap the page at some point, so you win back the cost
of creating the pte_chain there, hopefully.  You could argue that paying
the cost up front makes latency a little worse.  You might have trouble
measuring that though.

You get a perfectly good clock by scanning the lru list.  It's not
totally fair because a page newly promoted from the cold end to the hot
end of the list will get scanned again after a much shorter delta-t,
but it's hard to see why that's bad.
