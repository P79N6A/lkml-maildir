Btw, this isn't the first time we've wanted to do a wakeup while 
potentially locked.
Is there any way to perhaps go a "wake_up_gentle()" that doesn't need the 
lock, and just basically does a potentially delayed wakeup by just 
scheduling it asynchronously.
That would have solved all those nasty printk issues too. These kinds of 
things don't need the strict "wake up NOW" behaviour - they are more of a 
"kick the dang thing and make sure it wakes up in some timely manner".
