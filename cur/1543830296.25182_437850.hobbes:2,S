We are not talking about the same things.
It isn't a technical thing whether route lookup is performed before or after
namespace change.
It is a fundamental question determining functionality of network namespaces.
We are talking about the capabilities namespaces provide.
Your proposal essentially denies namespaces to have their own tunnel or other
devices.  There is no point in having a device inside a namespace if the
namespace owner can't route all or some specific outgoing packets through
that device.  You don't allow system administrators to completely delegate
management of network configuration to namespace owners.
