2.4.4-pre8 does have the patch to keep write_inode from syncing a
bad_inode.        In the short term this is the best way to go.
For debugging further, it is probably best to put the warning in when
marking the inode dirty, and randomly returning bad_inodes from read_inode.
I'll give this a try next week.  
My guess is that UPDATE_ATIME is the offending caller, the follow_link path
in open_namei is at least one place that should trigger it.
