hmm. I guess this begs the question, is ACPI 100% working and stable now? 
I've got a similar problem with add-in IDE controllers which add more than 
8 IDE devices -- the 9th and higher devices are inaccessable with the same 
"hd?: lost interrupt" messages (beginning with hdi). The machine in 
question is a dual AthlonXP/MP 1900+ on that new Tyan S2466 mainboard. I 
figured it was a BIOS issue, but if the BIOS demands that ACPI configure 
stuff, then perhaps enabling ACPI is the key. I just wihs that BIOS 
manufacturers would get a fucking clue and realize that not all of us are 
going to be running that other ACPI-dependent OS on the board, and make a 
BIOS that configures devices the old-fashioned way: doing the work itself.
Tyan also needs to realize that assigning the same address to two sensors 
on the I2C bus just isn't a good idea...
Hopefully this fixes my problem. Thanks for the pointer! ;)
