Yes, I think so.
We are going to add a nice little optimization for compiles to Reiser4 
as a result of thinking about compile benchmarks.  We are going to sort 
filenames (and their corresponding file bodies) whose penultimate 
character is . by their last character first.  It seems this is optimal, 
and it is simple, and it is without any real world drawbacks.  This is 
easy for us because of our plugin design.
