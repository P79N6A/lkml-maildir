i think you are missing the point. We _do not know in advance_ whether X 
should be prioritized or not. It's the behavior of X that determines it. 
When X is reniced to -10 it fixes a few corner cases, but it breaks many 
other cases. We found that out time and time again.
btw., the tests i've done were not with X but using a shell prompt.

this is relative to how mainline+Mike's handles it. Users wont really 
care about the why's, they'll only see the slowdown.

i often run make jobs with -j200 or larger, and SD gets worse than even 
mainline much sooner than that.
