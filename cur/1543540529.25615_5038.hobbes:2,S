You've been reading too many conspiracy theories. Ext3 and Reiserfs are
not competitors. Ext3 is a tool to journal ext2fs. Its still slow on huge
directories and its still got every other ext2 feature good and bad
Reiserfs has fast handling of large file trees, efficient packing of small
files and a whole pile of stuff which puts it and XFS as the competitors.
Really its
ext3fs	-	migration path, highly stable, no other feature gain
versus
reiserfs - 	packing, name spaces, btrees lots of new goodies
xfs -		lots of scalable new (to Linux) goodies
ibm jfs - 	to be seen - but btrees and all the rest
and more researchy stuff like the tree-phase ext2 which offers a whole pile of
interesting future paths that journalling doesn't handle well
