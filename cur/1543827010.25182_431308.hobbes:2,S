For all subsystems that re-use the taskstats structure from the exit path,
we have the issue that you mentioned. Thats because several statistics co-exist
in the same structure. These subsystems can keep their tgid-stats empty by not
filling up anything in fill_tgid() or using this patch to selectively enable/disable
tgid stats.
For other subsystems, they could pass tgidstats as NULL to taskstats_exit_send().
