You are reading the protocol wrong in this case.
While the protocol does allow the server to implement the behaviour that
you've been advocating, it in no way mandates it. Nor does it mandate
that the client should gather files with the same (fsid,fileid) and
cache them together. Those are issues to do with _implementation_, and
are thus beyond the scope of the IETF.
In our case, the client will ignore the unique_handles attribute. It
will use filehandles as our inode cache identifier. It will not jump
through hoops to provide caching semantics that go beyond close-to-open
for servers that set unique_handles to "false".
