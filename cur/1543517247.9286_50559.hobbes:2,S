Hmmm... You have been victimized by a problem in a Linux distribution, and
being French myself, I perfectly understood the tone and contents of your
posting against that distribution. ;-)
Building a Linux distribution seems to me a very complex and hard work,
given that guys have to make work together numerous ingredients that, on
the whole, live separately and sometimes in sin. The risk of a serious
mistake seems large and I am not surprised such to happen sometimes. 
You must consider a commercial Linux distribution as a commercial product
not different from any other commercial product. The same way you donnot
purchase blindly a commercial product should apply to you facing Linux
distributions. A bad Linux distribution will likely tarnish itself rather
than the Linux kernel given that numerous excellent ones do exist for
years.
When a human (this applies to French people at least) is victimized by a
flaw in a product, he generally reacts by thinking and claiming that the 
offending product is just shit. Obviously this is untrue, otherwise
everything should be considered so. Speaking for me, I have understood 
your reaction in that context.
A distro war is very unlikely to happen given the number of camps that is
far geater that 2. Before such a war to happening, most, except 2, will
have probably to die of starvation. ;-)
