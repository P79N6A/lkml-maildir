I've already covered the deadlock detection problems, and that didn't
add anymore overhead. That was just what kept breaking every time I
changed something ;-)
The overhead is caused by the pi_setprio knowing when to stop following
the chain of blocked processes. Since it can't check for p->blocked_on
== NULL anymore. I first had it check that or p->flags & PF_PENDOWNER,
but since the process waking up can happen at anytime without grabbing
any lock, this flag can be cleared as well as the blocked_on at the time
of this test.  So I added another flag to p->flags to tell when the
process is locked and not pending ownership.  I don't know yet if this
works, I have to run to an appointment now and I'll find out when I get
back.
Oh, and I disabled the deadlock check on the stolen case. So when a
pending owner goes back to blocked, right now it doesn't check the
deadlock, since the code uses current as the test, and that no longer
applies. So for now I have a test in task_blocks_on_lock to see if task
== current otherwise, don't check for deadlocks.
