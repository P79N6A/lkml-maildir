I have been running mini-ll on -pre3 for a time. And have just booted pre3
with full-ll. I see no marvelous diff between them, but I am not pushing
my box to their knees. 
I can get numbers for you, but is there any test out there that gives them ?
Something like 'under this damned test your system just delayed as much as xxx us'.
That kind of 'my xmms does not skip' does not look like a very serious measure.
And could you tell me if some of this patches can interfere with results ?
This is what I am running just now:
- 2.4.18-pre3
- vm fixes from aa (vm-22, vm-raend, truncate-garbage)
- ext3-0.9.17 update
- ide-20011210 (hint: plz, make it in mainline for the time of .18...)
- irqrate-A1
- interrupts-seq-file
- spinlock-cacheline + fast-pte from -aa
- scalable timers
- sensors-cvs
- bproc 3.1.5
On that i have run full-ll+ll_fixes (from -aa) or mini-ll+ll_fixes.
(If someone is interested, patches are at
http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~magallon/linux/
 )
TIA.
