Ok, the status of my patches is as follows:
[PATCH] Use menuconfig objects II - netdev/wan
        the "menuconfig" WAN patch by Jan Engelhardt
[PATCH 1a/3] WAN Kconfig: change "depends on HDLC" to "select"
        the Kconfig changes for WAN (HDLC) drivers
[PATCH 2a/3] Intel IXP4xx network drivers
	IXP4xx "fuses" (installed on-chip CPU components) patch
[PATCH] Intel IXP4xx network drivers v.3 - QMGR
	IXP4xx hardware Queue Manager driver
[PATCH] Intel IXP4xx network drivers v.2 - NPE
	IXP4xx Network Processor Engine driver, needs "fuses" patch
[PATCH] Intel IXP4xx network drivers v.2 - Ethernet and HSS
	You guessed it, needs all of the above.
The:
[PATCH] Intel IXP4xx network drivers v.2 - QMGR
was faulty, thus v.3.
Fire again :-)
