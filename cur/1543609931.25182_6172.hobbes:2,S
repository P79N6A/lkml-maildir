In the past, chattr +S and mount -o sync always resulted in sync
metadata with no guarantees about data. 
I'm not sure this makes much sense, but it's what has always happened.
For directories, the behaviour is fine, in particular as it gives us
the same directory sync consistency semantics as synchronous BSD UFS.  
It's not clear to me that chattr/mount sync options make _any_ sense
for regular file metadata.  Rather than tightening up the semantics,
I'd actually prefer to restrict them so that they only apply to
directories.  Users who set the sync bits are usually doing so for
applications like MTAs where it's directory syncing which is
what matters: the apps typically fsync the files themselves, anyway.

Yes.
