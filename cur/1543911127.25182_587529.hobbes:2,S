The problem is they're two patching consecutively patching the same
file with 100% identical subject/description.
So either: they should be merged together into one patch
or the second (or first) needs a new description/subject
I right now got the second as 
vdso-do-something-more-with-unstripped-copies-on-disk:
Do something with vdsos and debug information
From: Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com>
TBD this needs a proper changelog/subject from Roland. I have no idea what 
it does
But clearly that's not an satisfactionary state. Which of the
options do you prefer?
