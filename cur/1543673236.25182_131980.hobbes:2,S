All of the HSM systems I've used had the XDSM handled outside the kernel.
The only thing actually IN the kernel was the VFS module to intercept the
VFS calls (like userfs did) and then pass them to an external daemon to 
retrieve the data of migrated files. In the two cases, the rest of the 
filesystem was implemented within the VFS module. One case I've read about,
(datatree??? something like that) used an NFS interface to allow it to pass
the requests on to a non-HSM filesystem when the data was put on disk.

I don't know either, but all XDSM was to do was support the user mode
infrastructure behind the VFS module.
