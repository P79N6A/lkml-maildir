Woof. It weren't pretty, and I've carefully archived it so as
to make it hard to go back to for that very reason. Maybe someday.

The ss interface provides no advantage over the LSM interface that

Which is the same for LSM. There are a bunch of LSM hooks that Smack
does not need, and going into SELinux code to choose to do nothing
is pretty pointless.

The image that just flashed into my brain had a disturbing
similarity to STREAMS modules, but spread everywhere, not just
in the tty code. And anyone who thinks that there are too many
LSM hooks now would have kittens over this. I don't think it's a
bad idea, but I don't see how it would change the well documented
disputes regarding what kinds of security behavior it ought to
provide for. How would it help AppArmor, for example? I'm willing
to bet (a beer or equivalence) that anything that helped there
would face stiff resistance simply because it helped there.
I could see it working if you restricted the interface to dealing
with things that have security blobs, or even better to subjects
and objects. But that's my security mindset, and I think pretty
much yours, too. It's the policies that don't use good old
fashioned OrangeBook concepts that have issue, not SELinux or Smack.

Smack uses text strings for labels. It's amazing how many of the API
issues evaporate when the only thing you have to do with your labels is
compare them and print them. With the labels for processes available
through /proc, and the labels for most things available via getxattr(2)
and its variants the API issue seems hard to get worked up about. If
ls(1) had an option to show selected extended attributes, and it really
should by now, it wouldn't require fixing at all. Now sshd, login, and
the rest of the authentification gaggle are going to need policy
specific behavior so I feel no serious need to provide common API there.
Smack is designed to make this easy because I had to do it the hard
way before and didn't like it much.
