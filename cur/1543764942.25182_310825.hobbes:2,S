Looking forward to the split of synchronize_kernel() into synchronize_rcu()
and synchronize_sched(), the two choices are:
o	Use synchronize_rcu(), but insert rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock()
	pairs on the read side.
o	Use synchronize_sched(), and make sure all read-side code is
	under preempt_disable().
Either way, there may also need to be some rcu_dereference()s when picking
up pointer and rcu_assign_pointer()s when updating the pointers.
For example, if traversing the domain parent list is to be RCU protected,
the for_each_domain() macro should change to something like:
#define for_each_domain(cpu, domain) \
	for (domain = cpu_rq(cpu)->sd; domain; domain = rcu_dereference(domain->parent))
							Thanx, Paul
