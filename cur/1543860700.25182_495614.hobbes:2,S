If Linuxbios has its way then this is indeed not true.  We are in the 
middle of our design for V3 and the hardware representation will be 
based on a device-tree description.  From that we plan to auto generate 
the various tables that i386 stuff uses.  But ideally the kernel could 
get all it needed from the device-tree.
At least 1 major manufacturer is interested in providing LinuxBios on 
some of its motherboards and AMD supports LinuxBios so in the near 
future x86 should have a real reason to have full device-tree support.
