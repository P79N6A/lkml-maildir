I won't disagree with that.  That's why my philosophy is to try to force
all bug reports out of bugzilla and on to the relevant mailing list
because of the many eyes approach this engenders.

If I were you, I'd actually make a cursory effort to get my facts
straight before spouting off.
This bug was actually hidden in bugzilla for ages, where Matthew Wilcox
was trying to deal with it on his own.  The first I heard of it (apart
from a linux-scsi question on 13 November, when regrettably, I was busy
with other things) was on 18 Dec when Natalie added me to the bugzilla
cc list.  The first thing I did on that date was finger pktcdvd and add
Jens to the cc list ... however, since there was no mailing list thread
to follow he ended up asking for context which no-one provided.
The whole problem with this bug was generated precisely because it was
kept in bugzilla where too few people actually looked at it.  You're the
one who annotated the bugzilla entries with trite little homilies asking
why there was no action *without* ever notifying any mailing list, I
might add.
The fault lies in our bug processing methodology.  Bugzilla is a fine
tracking tool, but it's a bloody useless workflow one for actually
solving problems because, as you say, and I agree, the mailing lists are
where we produce the solutions.

Oh good grief ... we do add other mailing lists to the cc list (most
often lkml) when it becomes evident that it's not a SCSI problem.  Most
bug reports actually start off going to a set of lists (including lkml)
anyway, so there's usually full context.  You may love drinking from the
firehose ... I find it makes me want to pee a lot.  Forcing your work
habits on everyone else isn't really a very community way of solving
anything.
