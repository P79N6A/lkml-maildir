In that case they are filesystems or some other thing that fits the
model closely enough for try_ind_mod_count to be efficient.  This
case is easy and solved as far as I'm concerned, do correct me if
I'm wrong.  Assuming I'm not wrong, on to a hard and interesting
case.

Let's consider LSM as a really hard case, and let's suppose that the 
register_*'s just plug new functions into function tables.  These functions 
are just called indirectly, there is no module entry/exit accounting 
whatsoever, except that the inc/dec rule must be followed where module code 
itself might sleep.
Anyway, at the -EBARF point, all the function pointers have been restored to 
their original state, but we may have some tasks executing in the module 
already, which got in while _xxx was there.  The solution is to do the 
magic_wait_for_quiescence (yes I know it has a real name, I forgot it) before 
returning -EBARF.  Refcounts never come into it.
What did I miss?  It was too easy.
Ah, I'm glossing over how the "I need to sleep" intramodule refcounts 
interact with the magic quiescence test.  Let's see if some sleep fixes that. 
I doubt this is any central issue though.  We could, for instance, pass the 
address of the count variable to the quiescence tester, and it will be 
examined at schedule time, however that works (I promise to find out soon).

We don't.  Our LSM module will first restore all the function pointers to
their original state, then wait for everyone to schedule.

I don't see the endless wait.  It looks to me like it's just the time 
required for everyone to schedule, which is unbounded all right, but not in 
any interesting sense.
