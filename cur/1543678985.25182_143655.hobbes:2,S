Why in include/linux/irq.h ? These macros are definetely arch specific.
Do you talk about generic array based implementation wrapped in 
#ifdef ARCH_HAVE_FOO ?

Why it will break ? Every arch defines irq descriptors itself now.
May be I'm missing some point here ?

I thinked about this already, but i wanted to finish cleanup work first.
BTW sparc implementation of irq_itoa() uses static buffer for the formatted 
string, is it really irq/preempt safe ?
