I did not miss it.  Changing cflags is detected by the
.<object>.o.flags files.
ifeq (-D__KERNEL__ -I/build/kaos/2.4.11-pre4/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i586,$(strip $(subst $(comma),:,$(CFLAGS) $(EXTRA_CFLAGS) $(CFLAGS_vt.o))))
FILES_FLAGS_UP_TO_DATE += vt.o

kbuild already detects changes to flags, down to the level of
per-object flags, there is no need to detect changes to the top level
Makefile.  Especially when you can override flags and other fields on
the make command line, that does not change Makefile but kbuild still
detects the changes.
