This is not an accident that is being hidden by mistake.
The BIOS probes for the legacy mouse.
If it finds one, it gives it IRQ12.
If it doesn't find one it gives IRQ12 to PCI.
Other BIOS's are not as good as these and they don't give the free IRQs
to PCI.  Sub-optimal, but perfectly legal.
Exact same situation Chris and Adrian see with the floppy and IRQ6.
Exact same situation could potentially be seen with any motherboard
device and any IRQ -- except, of course, those that can't be probed or
are otherwise hard-coded for well known legacy devices, such as the RTC
on IRQ8.

Windows uses ACPI to probe the legacy motherboard devices, and ACPI uses
what the BIOS finds.  If the BIOS and ACPI don't know about the
motherboard device, then it isn't an ACPI system and among other
failures, it would never have got a nifty Made for Windows sticker, and
thus would have market penetration of approximately 0.
Linux is just now learning to use ACPI for probing legacy motherboard
devices.  I believe that this transition can be made safely and that
legacy probes should continue to work both during and after the
transition.

This is not a fix, it will break systems in the field.
When we enable a link, we must set the ELCR.
When we disable a link, we must clear the ELCR.
We need to be able to enable and disable all links in the system.
The bug was that while we were were setting the ELCR
when we enabled a link, we were not clearing it when we disabled one.
We also have an issue when we move the destiation of a link,
though we don't do that very often.
My debug patch cleared every bit in the ELCR even if no PCI interrupt
link device pointed to that entry.  Yes, this assumes that ACPI knows
about every level triggered interrupt in the system.
I think that is a valid assumption on an ACPI-compliant system.
But if you're more comfortable with disabling the associated ELCR bit
only when we disable links directed at that entry, we can do that too. 
The complication with that approach is that links are many to one, so
clearing the bit without disabling all links directed to that entry
would result in a failure.  Also, the SCI uses the ELCR too, and it
isn't described by links at all.
