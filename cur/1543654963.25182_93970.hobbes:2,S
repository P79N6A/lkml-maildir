Hello -
    I was wondering if there were and know NFS issues with IRIX clients? 
  I'm seeing a problem where an IRIX 6.5.17m client
accessing a linux 2.4.18 (redhat 7.2: -18.7.x) server will hang trying
to access a mount.  No traffic appears to make it to the server so it
appears to be locked up on the client end, but I don't know why.
  Thanks!
