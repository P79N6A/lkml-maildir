I added the multiply back because gcc (v. 3.3.4) does generate the 
fastest code
if I write it this way. I compiled, inspected the generated assembly and 
benchmarked
about a  dozend variations of the code (benchmark as previously described).
The special case for s_pitch == 1 saves about 10 ms system time (770 ms 
-> 760 ms)
The special case for s_pitch == 2 saves about 270 ms system time (2120 
-> 1850ms)
with a 16x30 font.
The third case is for even bigger fonts ... I believe that it will not 
often be used but
something like that must be present.

The first version will only be generated when gcc can be sure that 
s_pitch is 1.
Therefore you had to explicitly call __fb_pad_aligned_buffer with that 
value:
	if (likely(idx == 1))
		__fb_pad_aligned_buffer(dst, pitch, src, 1, image.height);
	else
		fb_pad_aligned_buffer(dst, pitch, src, idx, image.height);
 
With the version I propose it´s enough to write
		__fb_pad_aligned_buffer(dst, pitch, src, idx, image.height);
instead, and you will get good performance for all cases. If the value of
idx/s_pitch is know at compile time, the compiler can and will ignore the
other cases.

fb_pad_aligned_buffer() is  usefull to save some space in cases like 
softcursor.
It´s also used by some  drivers (nvidia and riva), but the authors of 
those drivers
have to decide if they prefer the inlined version or the version fixed 
in fbmem.

I tested that code, together with the followig code in but_putcs():
             if(idx==1)
                    __fb_pad_aligned_buffer(dst, pitch, src, 1, 
image.height);
             else if (idx==2)
                    __fb_pad_aligned_buffer(dst, pitch, src, 2, 
image.height);
             else
                    fb_pad_aligned_buffer(dst, pitch, src, idx, 
image.height);
             dst += width;
It´s as fast/slow as your previous version, the measurements are almost 
identical.
Let´s summarize:
Your version of __fb_pad_aligned_buffer looks much better, but it needs 
not so nice
conditionals when used. My version looks bad, but it is easier to use 
and it is
_faster_.
