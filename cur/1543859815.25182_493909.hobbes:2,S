Hi everyone,
I have been reading this thread for the last few days, but have been
silent. I have 3 torrents here for testing, if you want.
You can easily reproduce with "rtorrent", if you:
- Have a completly downloaded one, no matter what size
- Corrupt the download with
  dd if=/dev/zero of=download.file bs=16k count=1
- Restart 'rtorrent', hash-check fails
- It will download 1 piece that was corrupted.
The important part here is that rtorrent transfers one piece,
using its own code sequence to write to the file.
Let me offer to test until Saturday afternoon CET,
I have a cloned git repository, downloaded torrent files and "apt".
My systems that are affected are:
Linux oscar 2.6.18 SMP (2x450Mhz Intel P3)
(rolled back to 2.6.18 but can boot latest git)
Linux tony 2.6.20-git UP
(can be tested using all kinds of "apt" operations)
Both machines are using:
IDE  -> MD-RAID1 -> LVM -> EXT3 (data=ordered)
SCSI -> MD-RAID5 -> .....
I don't want to disturb your technical discussion,
just offering some help in testing.
Regards,
Patrick
