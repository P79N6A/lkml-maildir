Here is what we get from _STA:
[ 1689.988245] HID=PNP0501 flags=0d
If I read specs correctly, if bit 1 is cleared it means, device is not able
to access its hardware resources, so it makes no sense to even try to
load driver for it.
And of course it makes PnP output completely bogus:
00:09 PNP0501 16550A-compatible serial port
    state = active
    allocated resources:
        io 0x3f8-0x3ff
        irq 5
So two questions:
1. why device got enabled when ACPI explicitly stated it cannot be?
2. can we get information about _STA result in user space so we do not try
to autoload driver for device that can't work?
