I had installed slackware 7.0 (kernel 2.2.13) on my machine.
I am trying to upgrade kernel to the latest 2.4.0-test5.
I compiled the kernel on the machine. When I boot, it hangs
right after uncompressing the kernel.  Anybody know why?
Thanks for the help.
Here is what screen show when booting:
...
boot:
Loading 2.4...................
Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel.
<system hangs here without any prompt>
