Just strike that "Platforms may specify..." sentence.  It's incorrect.
The normal way to specify "no IRQ" is, surprise!, to not specify one.
The rule about IRQ=0 is that it's not for generic driver use... and I
happen to know a family of platforms where it's used for the RTC and
a few other core system drivers.  (Your patch doesn't touch them.)
