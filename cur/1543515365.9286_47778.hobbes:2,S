just finishing off a new ext3 release, then I'll get back to some kiobuf
work for 2.3.  In particular:

I'll be doing a separate call to lock and unlock kiovecs independently
of the mapping of the user pages.

The idea is that you call lock_kiovec() on the entire range of pages to
be locked.  If there are any double pages, the second lock will fail and
you'll get EINVAL on the whole call.  Kiovec operations are not supposed
to include a page more than once (the zero page is exempt from this).

Again, that is addressed by the separating out of the lock operations.
Lock/unlock is supposed to surround one IO, not a process's mapping.  An
IO is _always_ expected to complete, regardless of what is happening to
maps of the pages concerned.

Yep, but it should be getting closer.
