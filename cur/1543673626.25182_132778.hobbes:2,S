Hallo guys,
  I tried to post to the list a couple of times but without any success.
So here are the facts.
I have a small user program and the latest 2.4.20 stable kernel.
It is running on a board from IEI ( Wafer-5823 ) with a Cyrix 300 CPU.
 What happens is that after 2 hours of running this user program the
computer
freezes. I have the linux crash dump compiled inside the kernel and
activated
along with the magic sysrq key. Nothing works. I get only some messages
inside
the /var/log/messages but none of them are related to the crash ( modprobe
says it
can not load some module ).
Any ideeas of how to move forward with this will be greatly appreciated.
Cheers,
Nicu
