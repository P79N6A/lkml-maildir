This one gets me a penguin on the framebuffer, and then dies
with no further textual output.  
numlock leds were working, and I could reboot with sysrq.
Single opteron, Matrox G550 AGP framebuffer.  There is also
a pci radeon in the machine, but no driver for it as X has
to do int10 initialization first.
