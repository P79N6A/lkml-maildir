This can't happen. We are always looking at the first waiter on
task->pi_waiter task->pi_lock held when doing the boosting. If task
has released the lock the entry task->pi_waiter is gone and no boosting
will take place!

The i.e. refers to wrong conclusion and therefore the above can't be
concluded.
