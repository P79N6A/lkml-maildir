Subject: [BUG] 2.4.21-pre3 hdparm -X violates IDE locking

This bug impacts all versions of the kernel that I have looked at 
including 2.4.18 and above.  It probably impacts many other versions as 
well.
hdparm -X issues a drive command ioctl which eventually issue a command 
to the drive bypassing all of the normal locking.  The net effect is 
that a command can be set to the drive when the drive is not ready. 
 Some drives lock up when this happens.
The call chain is
ide_ioctl calls
ide_cmd_ioctl
If the command is a set features to change the communications speed, 
after the command is complete, ide_cmd_ioctl calls
ide_set_xfer_rate
ide_set_xfer_rate then calls drive->speedproc.
Most speedprocs then call ide_config_drive_speed
ide_config_drive_speed issue a set features command. and busy waits on it.
The easiest fix is to probably modify execute_drive_command to update 
drive->current_speed when it issues the appropriate SET FEATURES 
command, and then have ide_config_drive_speed do nothing if speed == 
current_speed.
I did a much bigger modification that handles changing drive speed 
specially and immediately.  I'll make patches for either one, but I 
wanted to get some opinions before I did so.
