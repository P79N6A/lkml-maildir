Hi Greg, I'm not sure when these problems started showing up, maybe they
have been in 2.6.6- for a while.  One patch that may be worth having in 2.6.6
by the way is the one for device_disconnect in devio.c that changes
destroy_all_async to destroy_async_on_interface.  It's clearly correct and does
do some good!
Ciao,
Duncan.
