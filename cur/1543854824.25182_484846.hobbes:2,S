I'll try, when I get home from work. I'll let you know later.

Well, it's a fact that sysrq works just fine before the lockup but
does not work at all after a lockup, so...

I can try building a kernel without highmem support and see if I can
still cause it to lockup. Would be an interresting datapoint.
I'll also try reproducing the lockup without any swap active to see if
that makes a difference.

It's a swap partition on a IBM Ultra160 10K RPM SCSI disk. The
controller is an Adaptec 29160N. Using the SCSI_AIC7XXX driver.

Just let me know what you would like me to try/test to prove/disprove that.
