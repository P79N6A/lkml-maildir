Has anyone else seen this behaviour?  Alexey especially must know...
I am getting the following unexpected behaviour with FreeS/WAN IPSEC
stopped (userspace keying daemon Pluto not running and interfaces
unconfigured), but statically linked into the kernel:
Manually issuing the commands:
  ipsec tncfg --attach --virtual ipsec0 --physical eth0
  ifconfig ipsec0 <eth0addr> netmask <eth0netmask> broadcast <eth0broadcast>
will automatically add the route to <eth0subnet> via ipsec0 *in
addition to* the existing route to <eth0subnet> via eth0.  The first
command is the FreeS/WAN IPSEC command to attach a virtual device to a
physical device.  Furthermore, I am not able to delete the extra
route.
Eh?  This does not happen under 2.0.xx series kernels.  Why does it
happen under 2.2.xx?  This is not wanted, we want to add the routes
ourselves to likely unrelated destinations.
How does the kernel routing table decide to which route to send the
packet if there are two with the same net/mask specification?  Metric?
 ...The more I beat my head on this stuff, the more it has
to go in favour of the ipchains/netfilter model... <shaking head>
