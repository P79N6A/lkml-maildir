Subject: [PATCH 5/5] lguest: loading bzImage directly
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/2/366

Now arch/i386/boot/compressed/head.S understands the hardware_platform field,
we can directly execute bzImages.  No more horrific unpacking code.
