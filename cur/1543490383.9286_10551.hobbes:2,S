To distinguish between partition access on the same major device.

No, each major has its own queue, defined either by the
blkdev[major].queue() strategy function or by
blkdev[major].current_request.  As far as IN_ORDER is concerned, it will
only ever look at one such queue at a time.  
You're probably thinking of the global request array "all_requests", but
that is just a global, static pool from which we allocate request
structs.  Active requests are most definitely kept on separate queues
for each device.
