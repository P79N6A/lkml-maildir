No need for a huge long e-mail to make a basic point:
Don't lump CML2 and Keith's kbuild work together.
I agree, and this is a good point.

We've been doing that for CML2.  For months, actually.
kbuild (again, as you point out) is quite another matter.  Perhaps we
can point Keith to post a test patch against 2.5.5-pre1, for us to
review and comment on? 
I believe there are probably still some issues to resolve, but I would
love to see a better makefile system for 2.5.
Regards,
