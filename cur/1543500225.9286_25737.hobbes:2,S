I might be off track here , but is the second line anyhow related to
object oriented programming ?
Then the difference is mostly in the syntax , because on lower level the
second line get translated to :
read_nr_32( fd ,   buf,sz)
The correct method/function is choosen and called with the additional
"implicit"  parameter , a pointer to the object.
The correct function can be found at compile time or run time, 
when using virtual methods.
Now what I understood under sending messages in OS is :
message_type *m;
m = <the contents of the message>
send_message(m [ , destination ]  ) ;
So the execution will not neccesarily be transfered to another piece of code.
Just the message would be transfered to some mailbox.
This is ( more or less ) how AmigaOS works. For example a task sends a message to
the filesystem "do this" , the message is sent and the task continues its bussiness.
The filesystem , which is another task , reads the message , does something and 
sends a reply.
Well , just some thoughts of mine ...
