Subject: dead(?) header files in the source tree

  following up on an earlier post by stefan richter, i wrote a
brute-force little script that scanned the source tree, looking for
header files that weren't included from *anywhere* in the tree.  what
turned up was the following:
./arch/m68k/atari/atasound.h
./arch/arm/mach-s3c2410/bast.h
./arch/ppc/syslib/cpc710.h
./arch/um/kernel/tt/include/mode_kern-tt.h
./arch/powerpc/platforms/83xx/mpc834x_itx.h
./drivers/serial/crisv10.h
./drivers/isdn/hardware/eicon/dbgioctl.h
./drivers/char/digi.h
./drivers/message/i2o/i2o_lan.h
./drivers/net/wan/lmc/lmc_media.h
./drivers/net/skfp/h/lnkstat.h
./drivers/isdn/hardware/eicon/main_if.h
./drivers/message/fusion/lsi/mpi_inb.h
./drivers/message/fusion/lsi/mpi_log_fc.h
./drivers/video/riva/nv4ref.h
./drivers/scsi/pci2000.h
./drivers/char/drm/via_mm.h
./drivers/net/chelsio/vsc8244_reg.h
./include/linux/elfnote.h
./sound/pci/au88x0/au88x0_sb.h
./sound/pci/cs46xx/imgs/cwcemb80.h
  this list represents an absolute *minimum* of what are apparently
orphaned header files, in that they are not referenced from *anywhere
else* in the tree, not even from include directives that are
currently commented out.  in short, they are truly homeless (assuming
i didn't screw up my programming, that is).
  anyone want to get rid of some of them?
