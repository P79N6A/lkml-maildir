Not on UP and not in 2.2. 
2.2 queueing is so paranoid (exactly to workaround wrong tbusy handling
inside drivers), that the only effect of misused tbusy should be only
excessive cpu eating.
I see two explanations:
1. device is lost from run queue because of some bug in scheduler.
2. device stopped to receive rx interrupts.
I repeat the request: gentlemen, please, make tcpdump both on
wire and on local host with "tcpdump -i eth0 -n -v -s 256 -x icmp",
when pinging. The investigation even will not be started until
I get at least one report of this kind.
