       Hi,
   I just tried to boot 2.3.6 (I have used 2.3.5 with no problems) and it
seems that there is a problem with the PIIX code. Here's the relevant
fragment from booting sequence:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.19
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:DMA
hda: ST31277A, ATA DISK drive
hdb: CRD-8320B, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: set_geometry_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: set_geometry_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
hda: ST31277A, 1221MB w/0kB Cache, CHS=620/64/63
hdb: ATAPI 32X CD-ROM drive, 128kB Cache
Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.55
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 hda3
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
init: error in loading shared libraries: libutil.so.1: failed to map
segment from shared object: Cannot allocate memory
If you need more information I'm wiling to do more tests and see what's
happening.
