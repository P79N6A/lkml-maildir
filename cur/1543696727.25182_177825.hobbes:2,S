Not exactly - the X-pre kernel would contain all patches contained in
X-1-rc available at the time. While there is a (relatively small) chance
that a subset of independent patches breaks things while the complete set
does not, all patches contained in -rc would be tested by both rc and pre
users.
Of course, many people would stick to -rc patches only, and others would
use just final kernels.
