Thanks, I think I found the reason. Does the patch below fix it...

[PATCH net-2.6] [TCP]: Prevent sending past receiver window with TSO (at last skb)
With TSO it was possible to send past the receiver window when
the skb to be sent was the last in the write queue while the
receiver window is the limiting factor. One can notice that
there's a loophole in the tcp_mss_split_point that lacked
a receiver window check for the tcp_write_queue_tail() if also
cwnd was smaller than the full skb.
Noticed by Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de> in form of
"Treason uncloaked! Peer ... shrinks window .... Repaired."
messages (the peer didn't actually shrink its window as the
message suggests, we had just sent something past it without
a permission to do so).
