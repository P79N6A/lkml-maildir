Yes, this one has crept in by mistake I think. I'll fix that right away.

Indeed. This even does not feature in any of the gfs2 patches in the git
tree. For some reason the command I used to create the diff has picked
up this change as well. I'm not entirely sure why as its in both the
gfs2 tree and the origin tree (Linus' tree).

Yes, you can. I just always tend to run it through the mkfs front end
rather than directly. It installs itself under mkfs.gfs2 of course and
we need up update the man page (GFS1 used to call its mkfs gfs_mkfs but
I saw no reason not to make the change to a more conventional name).
