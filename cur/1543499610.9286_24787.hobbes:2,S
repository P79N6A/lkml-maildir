A gentleman Ross W. Myers <rmyers@nosc.mil> sent me a snippit of code that
crashes his 2.2.10 machine.  It crashed mine as well.  Just let it run,
and do whatever, takes about 20 seconds on my box.  I am going to look at
what its doing but I am posting it here becuase it probably should get
some attention by people close to the source.  It is my understanding that
no "user level" program should be able to crash a machine, no matter how
sloppely written (well thats the idea anyways :) ).
Anyways, code is here.  Very reproducable.
