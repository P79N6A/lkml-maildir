No!
You do _not_ want me to merge it now unless you're speaking of drivers/
and arch code from the standpoint of "advance notice", "version skew",
or "compatibility API's". I am not done and the core impacts of the
current source are unacceptable (even to me, who wrote the 2.5 stuff)
and furthermore the antifragmentation bits are so grossly incomplete
it's not worthy of being called a full implementation. I am willing to
accept "help" but would prefer it not be given; yes I am being slow,
but unless it's a true emergency I would much prefer to do my own
homework as it were, if only for my own edification.
This _may_ sound like it's "anti-open", but it isn't really. The fact
is this is important, so even intermediate steps need discussion, but
at the same time, I am working hard, learning, and absolutely must not
be "bailed out" except if this becomes truly critical, for otherwise I
won't learn enough to maintain it myself and as I've taken on this
myself, I need to be able to take up the burden of maintaining it even
after it's merged -- that is, by learning the hard way, not bailouts.
Even beyond this general statement, the supposed pte_chain space
reductions owing to page clustering are an open question with respect
to effectiveness. I myself would need better a priori evidence and/or
empirical evidence of this to add it to my list of claimed benefits.
All this said, the drivers and the arch code bits are actually largely
trivial substitions. If the discussion is truly limited to that, I'm
okay with sending in pieces; still it makes me uneasy to do anything
while the code I have now is so far from working as it truly should.
