Subject: [RFC]: additional trace messages for the "access beyond eod"-bug

I've not yet read all threads about this bug, but do we know why the
kernel tries to read that sector (ie. is it metadata, or a normal data
block; is the datablock directly referenced from the inode, or is it an
indirect block?)
And: is just one 32-bit value corrupted, or a longer area?
If it is from an indirect block, perhaps the first/last value in that
block?
What about modifying ext2_block_map():
* check the results from block_bmap() and inode_bmap() for sanity ( <
sb.s_blocks_count)
* if they are obviously wrong, then dump the inode number, perhaps the
complete data block which containes the bogous value, the file offset
etc.
Or: fsck could dump that.
