Yup, you are right. Removing a disk from a controller shall return
anything with bit 7 at 0 per spec, but removing the controller
itself will return 0xff. Actually, in my "wait for BSY low" loop
I added to the probe code for pmac (should be made generic sooner
or later), I did special case 0xff.
So we should indeed fix the various bits in IDE. 0xff out of
status, I beleive, never means anything and can always be considered
as "this interface is gone".
