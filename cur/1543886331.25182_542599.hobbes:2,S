No, that would be incorrect.  As I mentioned earlier, there are magic
semantics to bits < 16, namely that they are in _TIF_ALLWORK_MASK (and
assembly code knows implicitly that these are in the low 16 bits).
TIF_FORCED_TF must not be in _TIF_ALLWORK_MASK, hence must be >= 16.

I've converted the comments to kerneldoc style where I could figure out how
to.  I left some unmarked comments in places I couldn't see how to get them
extracted from.  I'd appreciate any specific advice you have for the
descriptive comments as they now stand.

What I had in mind was whole chunks of code you might not build, including
global symbols or whole modules.  In particular, I expect to have some
utility code for executing a single copied instruction (in the style of
kprobes), which can also be implemented for machines without single-step
(see kprobes ARM port).  That could be employed to simulate single-stepping
by a tracing engine (though not without complexities and caveats, which is
why it won't be built in as the UTRACE_ACTION_SINGLESTEP support).  An
engine could support this using only machine-independent interfaces to the
aforementioned utility code, and rely on arch_has_single_step() to know
whether it needs to.  That code might be costly to build in and would not
all be dropped at compile time even if always dead at runtime, or perhaps
isn't there at all for a particular machine.  But if on that machine you
know at compile time that arch_has_single_step() will never return 0, you
don't need it.  I don't want to get too bogged down in those specifics,
because they aren't the point right now.  The only point I'm making here is
that #if really is going to be useful.

As I understand it, Alpha and ARM hardware in fact have no single-step feature.
There may be others.

I've changed it that way now.
Thanks,
