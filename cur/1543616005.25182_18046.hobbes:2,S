Rene,
I think that while this patch may work for you, it's not the right way
to go about it.
Instead of changing the source for all devices that use transport.c,
you should create a flag (see usb.h), say US_FL_SLIDE_BUG, and set
it within the definition in unusual_devs.h
Then the logic in transport.c can check for that flag and work around
the bug as needed -- as not all storage devices will require that
workaround.
I'm in the process of recompiling my 2.5.2-pre9 kernel with the above
workaround to see if it solves my issues as well.  Unfortunately, my
device is at home, and I'm at work.  I'll post later tonight or tomorrow
morning my results.
Greg? Your opinions on the right way to work this?
