Hi!
I write usb driver for embedded sh4 200MHz system (2.4.28 kernel) and added
printk into rx_callback and it prints following.
(this is just example)
packet 1: length=14, data=02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 01 01 01 01
packet 2: length=10, data=02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02
while right result must be
packet 1: length=14, data=01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01
packet 2: length=10, data=02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02
It seems that 2nd packet placed over 1st one.
I submit single int urb and it happens often while high CPU usage.
As I understand it can not be fixed because of there is no HCI flow control
between host and usb device. Am I right?
(I use usb-skeleton.c as a template)
