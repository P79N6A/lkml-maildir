I'm plugged in to a cable modem, with the DHCP server at the ISP.  The
server requires the MAC address to be registered, so sending the DHCP
request with a different MAC address could cause the symptoms.  I doubt
it's a timing problem - replacing the 8139 driver with the 2.4.3 version
but otherwise using the distributed 2.4.4 makes DHCP work as expected.
