There was a thread about this some months ago
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111639356609390&w=2),
and two patches were proposed, to either return NULL here or WARN_ON,
and keep going.  Neither seems to have been picked up.  Maybe people
think this is not a big problem?  I would certainly like to see a way
to prevent modules from being loaded multiple times, or when they are
also compiled-in, but aside from returning NULL here in
kmem_cache_create, I don't see a trivial way of doing it.
