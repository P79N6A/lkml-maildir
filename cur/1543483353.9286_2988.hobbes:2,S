Either side, same problem.  If I load 2.1.1xx on one machine and ping the
2.2 machine the 2.2 machine gets the messages (tcpdump shows this) but all i
see on the receving end is transmit timeout(1,80) (std timeout msg). Oddly
enough tcpdump 'eats' icmp ping replies, but I know the message doesn't get
sent back out because i get no icmp reply, tcpdump just happens to show me
that 'yes, the message does make it through, and the system tries to reply'

printk for thos function to show entrancy, and you want to see printk's at
each point of return? As for teh enable/disable macros they already have
some at KERN_WARN, just so I could see that status of the irq if they
failed.  Maybe a message to show execution on net_debug > 1 would better
fit rather than showing only failed enable/disable.

Hmm.  No lockup, system remains functional, but the interface is no good
until reboot.  I like teh idea, i'll do it in a moment.  OTOH, how/where is
the initial state of teh irq dor the pardev being set?  parport code at
boot?
If I knew this I'd feel better.

ugh, you're right.. :)

I'm aware of this, I'm not suggesting a change to the protocol.  :) It
wouldn't be a bda thing to have a Native alternative, maybe in a few months
when I get bored.
