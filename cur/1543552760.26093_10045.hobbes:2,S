Thanks Keith for that detailed description of what is going wrong, I
would have never figured that out.

Yeah, a valid reason for LINK_FIRST and LINK_LAST!
I'll try my hand at the wording. Randy, does this look acceptable:
# usb.o contains __init usb_init which must be executed before all
# other usb __init routines, the remaining usb __init routines can be
# executed in any order.  Execution order of __init routines depends
# on link order so usb.o must be linked first.  Otherwise, the
# individual drivers will be initialized before the hub driver is,
# causing the hub driver initialization sequence to needlessly probe
# every USB driver with the root hub device.  This causes a lot of
# unnecessary system log messages, a lot of user confusion, and has
# been known to cause a incorrectly programmed USB device driver to
# grab the root hub device improperly.

LINK_FIRST := usb.o

That's the only known link problem for the USB drivers.
Thanks,
