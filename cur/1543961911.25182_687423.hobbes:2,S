I thought the many years old rule for Linux kernel is to fix the
issues properly and not turn kernel into patchwork of crappy code.
If we want to fix the randconfi issue I'd rather revert commit
66242f7ec531953fbc2f4040c5ffe1f1ffe6c5c9 for now (they only thing it
did was beautify menuconfig look) and wait for Kconfig to be fixed.
It is not driver's task to track through all dependencies.
