So do all the features people want to use these keyboards for.  This
is very much a desktop-console feature and people are going to be
running X on such a system.  If we have to re-implement X at the
console, we are doing ourselves a major disservice.  Additionally, if
you really need a super-advanced console, do it in user space.  As
someone on the linux-utf8 list said, "I wish someone had a long time
ago said `no further' with the in-kernel console..."
