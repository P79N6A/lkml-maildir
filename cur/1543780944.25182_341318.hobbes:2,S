Partly right. Actually, most SMBus controllers work the following way:
you program a number of registers (typically SMBus transaction type,
target chip address, target register address or command, and the data to
send in the case of a write transaction), then you tell the chip to
initiate the transaction. Then you poll for the transaction to be over
(or use an interupt, but most our SMBus drivers use polling), and read
the result in some register in the case of a read transaction.

No, it is still physically a 2-wire serial bus. The limitation is due to
the fast that the SMBus controller knows of a limited number of
transactions, such as Send Byte, Read Byte, Read Word etc. If the SMBus
controller doesn't know of the SMBus command you want to use (in my
case, I2C block read), then there is no way to do it, because we have no
direct control over the serial line.

Absolutely. The good thing is that SMBus masters are not CPU intensive,
contrary to bit-banging I2C adapters.
