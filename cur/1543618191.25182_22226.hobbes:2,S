See my post on /. regarding the bug.
In summary, I have 2 Thunderbird systems - a dual 1.4GHz Thunderbird on
Tyan Thunder K7 and a single 1.4GHz Thunderbird on Asus A7V133 - with
NVIDIA cards and the latest 2313 NVIDIA driver. The single runs RH 7.2
and this one (the dual) an up2date RH 7.1 with kernel 2.4.17. I have no
problems unless I boot a system into Win98. There are many other issues,
as you all know (and many dorks on /. apparently do not), that can and
will cause a system to hang. I run AGP4x, SBA, FSAA, and Anisotropic
filtering on most all games. I compile often many different things. The
ONLY times I have compile issues are when I compile some things (Torque
game engine and Quake II) with -march at anything over pentium, at which
point either the internal compiler bugs rear their ugly heads or I get
strange graphics in a game.
But since kernel 2.4.14, never a system lock.
