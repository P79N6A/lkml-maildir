	Your code receives such requests from remote host:
"who-has ANY_IP tell SHARED_IP"
	This broadcast request comes from host that advertises this
SHARED_IP but the duplicate detection code in the local host warns
about this IP because the same SHARED_IP is configured on the
receiver (on hidden device, it is not advertised).

	If everything is handled correctly may be this flag is not
needed. But in this case you have to check the hidden flag.

	Yes, I see the messages are rate limited but sip=127/8 is
possible to be generated from attacker (who knows):
"who-has ANY_IP tell 127.0.0.1"
	May be you can look at the ip_route_input_slow(). Search for
martian_source and how fib_validate_source is used. I'm not sure
but it looks like the checks will be very complex.
