Hi all,
After building 2.2.14 and installing it together with pcmcia 3.1.8 I
encountered a problem
I have with all latest 2.3.x kernels.  When swapping PCMCIA cards the system
hangs (no message at all).
After playing a little with it it appears that sometimes things goes fine.
I didn't dig into the problem.  This problem happens on my elder Dell Insprion
3200.
Sometime I'll also try it on my office NEC versa lx.
Sincerly,
Serge
