it to the list... ]
Hi people,
Is the ioperm patch necessary in 2.4 also? The fix by Brian Gerst was 
commited to the 2.5 branch 
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bk-commits-head&m=105275597307968&w=2) 
some days ago, and as of yesterday vendors are starting to ship a similar 
fix to their kernels, so I suppose it is indeed necessary. What about the 
attached patch? It applies to both 2.4.20 and .21-rc2, please review.
(Please forgive me if this has been discussed before, I did a quick 
search of the lkml archives and couldnt find anything relevant to 2.4)
Cheers,
			Nuno
