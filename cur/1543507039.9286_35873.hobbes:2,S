I can think of at least one compelling reason for doing so - bttv.
 
I run X and matroxfb consoles at precisely the same resolution, so if
I have a bttv app running in overlay mode (ie the bttv card is dumping
video directly onto the matrox's memory) and switch to a console, the
bttv data still appears on the screen. This is VERY annoying and it is
a pain to have to specifically minimise an individual window every
time I want to change to a console. So far, the only passable solution
has been to bind a key combo with E that will minimise the window and
chvt, but it's not ideal (and I have yet to find a way to bind a key
combo in a terminal, so when I switch back to X, I still have to
restore the bttv window).
In a perfect world, X would tell it's clients that it was about to
change the vt, but apparantly it doesn't.
