You would accept a patch where I made this stuff optional?
I have another problem:
I can't hide that my aim is to make task-latencies deterministic.
The worry is local_irq_disable() (and preempt_disable()). I can undefine
it and therefore find where it is used. I can then look at the code, make
it into raw_local_irq_disable() or try to make a lock.
In many cases the raw-irq disable is the best and simplest when I am only
worried about task-latencies. But now Daniel and Sven wants to use the
distingtion between raw_local_irq_disable() and local_irq_disable() to
make irqs fast. 
We do have a clash of notations. Any idea what to do? I mentioned
 local_
 raw_local_
 hard_local_
Would that work?
