	It may well be handy to have a threads implementation that makes these kinds 
of programs easy to write, but an OS's preferred pthreads is not and should 
not be that threads implementation. A platforms default/preferred pthreads 
implementation should be one that allows well-designed, high-performance 
I/O-intensive and compute-intensive tasks to run extremely well.
