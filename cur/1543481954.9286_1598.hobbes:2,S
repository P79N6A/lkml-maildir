Hi,
The parport_pc driver does not recognize the parallel port of my computer as
ECP+EPP when it is configured to be an ECP+EPP port, but just as a SPP,
ECP, ECP-PS/2.
The ppa driver works fine, in PS/2 mode :(.
Here is the boot info:
parport1: PC-style at 0x378 [SPP,ECP,ECPPS2]
ppa: Version 2.03 (for Linux 2.0.0)
ppa: Found device at ID 6, Attempting to use EPP 32 bit
ppa: Found device at ID 6, Attempting to use PS/2
ppa: Communication established with ID 6 using PS/2
scsi0 : Iomega VPI0 (ppa) interface
scsi : 1 host.
When change the parallel port mode to EPP-1.9, the parport driver recognizes it
as a SPP, EPP, PS2 port and the ppa driver uses that better mode.
Boot info:
parport1: PC-style at 0x378 [SPP,PS2,EPP] 
ppa: Version 2.03 (for Linux 2.0.0)
ppa: Found device at ID 6, Attempting to use EPP 32 bit
ppa: Communication established with ID 6 using EPP 32 bit
scsi0 : Iomega VPI0 (ppa) interface
scsi : 1 host.    
The partport driver used to work fine in the version of the kernel that was
previously installed on my computer (2.0.36).
