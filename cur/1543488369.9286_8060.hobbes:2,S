  No.
  The serial number, although proven by c't to be possible to switch on
without rebooting the machine (using a powermanagement trick), is not
possible to switch back on from userland. You need kernel privileges for
that as far as I know.  So, if you boot a kernel that disables this feature
on boot, you should be safe (*).
  In W9x it's a different story, though - any program can load a .VXD, which
has the 'kernel' privileges and does the job without the user noticing.
  Intel's serial number disabling utility 'fixes' this security hole (or
backdoor?) by disabling the serial number feature repeatedly every 15
seconds. Anyway, if a .VXD can switch it on, for 15 seconds, it'll of course
also manage to read it in that time and save it somewhere and disable it
afterward not to cause an alarm from the Intel utility.
  A difference between an OS and an 'OS' ....
Have fun,

(*) Unless you load third party binary-only modules / run third party
    binary-only suid root programs ... these of course can do it as well.
