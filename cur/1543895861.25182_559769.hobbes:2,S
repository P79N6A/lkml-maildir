Right. The particular issue with moving page table pages or slab pages is 
that you do not have a LRU. The page state needs to be established in a 
different way and there needs to be mechanism to ensure that the page is 
not currently being setup or torn down. For the slab pages I have relied 
on page->inuse > 0 to signify a page in use. I am not sure how one would 
realize that for page table pages.
