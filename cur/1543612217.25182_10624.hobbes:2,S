Agreed. There are some uglies...

Okay. I thought I was being stupid. :-)

Actually, I think I *may* have found the problem, in update ptr, it 
should look like this: going to test in a moment
        /* error handling and process wake up for DAC */
        if (dmabuf->enable == DAC_RUNNING) {
                /* update hardware pointer */
                hwptr = i810_get_dma_addr(state, 0);
                diff = hwptr - dmabuf->hwptr;
                if (hwptr < dmabuf->hwptr)
                        diff += dmabuf->dmasize;
#if defined(DEBUG_INTERRUPTS) || defined(DEBUG_MMAP)
                printk("DAC HWP %d,%d,%d\n", hwptr, dmabuf->hwptr, diff);
#endif
reason: hwptr hits 65536 which is indistinguishable from 0 in mod arithmetic
also, I ran your other DEBUG_MMAP patch and the news is that count just 
sits at 65536 ad nauseum.
