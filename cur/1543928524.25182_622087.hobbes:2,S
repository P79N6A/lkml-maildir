The driver core does use the split already in most places, I did that
long ago. There are not too many (~20) users of kobject_register(), and
it's a pretty straight-forward change to change that to _init, _add,
_uevent, and get rid of that totally useless "convenience api".
I think there is no longer any excuse to keep that broken code around,
and even require to document that it's broken. The whole purpose of the
uevent is userspace consumption, which just doesn't work correctly with
the code we offer. The fix is trivial, and should be done now, and we no
longer need to fiddle around timing issues, just because we are too
lazy.
I propose the removal of _all_ funtions that have *register* in their
name, and always require the following sequence:
  _init()
  _add()
  _uevent(_ADD)
  _uevent(_REMOVE)
  _del()
  _put()
The _create_and_register() functions would become  _create_ and_add()
and will need an additional _uevent() call after they populated the
object.
Thanks,
Kay
