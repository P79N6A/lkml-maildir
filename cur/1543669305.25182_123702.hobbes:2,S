That was a quick conclusion, after less than two hours :-)
Anyway, I agree with your general concern. It only seems good
engineering practice to also look at the numbering schemes that
are supposed to go with the device number enlargement.
Or, alternatively, to make sure that it's trivial to make further
enlargements (or shrinkages), if the need for them should arise.
I didn't look at the issue in detail, but perhaps the latter is
the case ?
