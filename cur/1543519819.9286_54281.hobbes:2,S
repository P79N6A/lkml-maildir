Hi,
I have set up a Linux server which also happens to be my local mail server.
I have created all my mail user accounts on this server and trying to download
mails from my main mail server which is in US.
When I download my mails using IMAP , then I am able to download with the option
of downloading only new mails and leave the older mails on the main mail server,
and it works fine. The only problem is with mails having
attachments. The mails get downloaded , but the attachment files are missing.
When I download the mails using POP3, then inspite of having given the option of
downloading only current mails it downloads all the messages all the time. I
have even tried the option with UIDL, but still it doesn\\\\\\\'t work.
As a result of this all my users get all the mails all the time.
I am using Linux Redhat 6.0 & 6.1and have configured the mail id\\\\\\\'s and mail
dowload options using fetchmailconf.
But, this problem is not there with IMAP or POP3 if I use any other mail server
like exchange or for that matter any mail client like :netscape mail , eudora or
outlook express to directly download from my US server.
Please help me out on this ASAP as I am in a dilemma on how to rectify this
problem.
thanks & regards
Anup
