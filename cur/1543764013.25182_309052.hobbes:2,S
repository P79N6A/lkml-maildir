Ok, for info, here is the email i just sent to the boradcom driver support :

Hello,
I am part of the Debian GNU/Linux kernel team, and recently stumbled about
some legal problems with the tg3.c driver for broadcom gigabit ethernet
controllers. The problem seems to be the same for the bcm570x drivers you
distribute from your web page, and after discussion with the debian-legal
team [1] and airing the issue with the larger linux kernel developers [2],
i now come to you for clarfication of this issue.
The broadcom 570x drivers are placed under the GPL, which is nice, and come
accompanied by sources, but include a few blobs of binary-only firmware to be
uploaded to the controller.
After discussion with debian-legal, we accept that the binary-only firmware
blob does not constitute a derivative work of the rest of the driver, but mere
agregation, so distributing it as binary only as you do is not a problem,
altough getting real sources for this part would be preferable.
Now, the problem is that both in the files included in the mainline kernel, as
well as the sources you distribute yourself, these firmware blobs come in a
file like fw_lso05.h, whose licence text says :

The above copyright statement clearly places the firmware blob under the GPL,
and makes the whole file undistributable without providing also the source
code, that is the prefered form of modification, of the firmware code in
question.
There are two solutions to this issue, either you abide by the GPL and provide
also the source code of those firmware binaries (the prefered solution :), or
you modify the copyright statement of these files, to indicate that even
thought the file per se is under the GPL, the firmware binary code is not, and
give us a licence to distribute it. Something akin to :
