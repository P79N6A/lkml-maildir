Karim,
A personal question?, do you feel that being patronising and insulting
is in any way going to put your LTT project in a better light? It
certainly makes it a  lot harder for many of us to take your arguments
serious.

And how is this going to solve the case where trace code in the syscall
path has a negative impact on cacheline utilization and alignment, even
when the trace data is not being used?

So you are back to saying that trace data other people wish to collect
are uninteresting and therefore should just be ignored? If not, what you
are saying there otherwise just backs up the argument that if LTT or
something similar goes into mainline, we will see the amount of
tracepoints grow significantly.

Please read what I wrote above! Touching the syscall path with static
tracepoints is costly and has side effects! The argument that things can
be compiled out is just pointless, end users do not recompile kernels at
random and many of the 'end user' cases where people wish to vizualize
trace data, are running on precompiled vendor kernels. Recompiling the
kernel and rebooting is not an option here!
In fact, the users who wish to trace data in self-compiled kernels are a
tiny subset of the potential userbase for this stuff which is primarily
useful to developers .... which in terms makes your argument about debug
tracepoints irrelevant since you are turning all the tracepoints into
debug tracepoints :)
