	Still wrong. You don't tie up threads waiting for I/O. You can wait without 
having a thread doing the waiting.

	Okay, so you need a new abstraction -- separate the waiting from the 
working. Create as many threads to do the work as you have processors to do 
the work on. As for the waiting, minimize threads waiting, they're pure 
overhead. If it's sockets, use 'poll' so one thread can do lots of waiting.

	So get rid of the problem! Don't create so many threads, create only as many 
threads as can do useful work and reuse them rather than destroying and 
recreating them. Solve the actual problem/overhead since it's totally 
artificial and due to your model rather than your problem!
