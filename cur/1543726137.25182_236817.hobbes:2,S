I'm trying to understand how that would work.  Let's take an example
of a 64GB file that I'm writing out from scratch.  I start a timer
before writing.  With my fsync() way of testing, I expect to stop the
timer the moment last byte has been written and fsync() has been
called.
I gather you're saying that continuing writing past the 64GB mark,
causing LRU expiration of the last bytes of the 64GB bytes from write
buffers is a more fair way to test, versus just calling fsync() once
at the end.  I'm happy to write my benchmarks this way too, except I
need to know two configuration values now:
1) when to stop the timer?
2) how much more to write past 64GB?

I think we agree that forcing the disks to write all of the data
before the timer stops is a fair way to compare between filesystems.
Otherwise we're "almost" measuring disk throughput, except for what
has been write-buffered...a real gray area.  But I think you're
pointing out that the results could be different depending on whether
the fsync() method or your "write past the intented amount" method for
flushing is used.  I'd be happy to run these benchmarks both ways, as
long as I knew how.  If you can help me answer my above questions,
I'll run them both ways.
Thanks,
