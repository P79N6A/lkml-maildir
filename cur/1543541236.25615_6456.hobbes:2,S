I'm not sure which layer caused this oops, but it is probably repeatable.

[7 disk changer, LUN 0-6, rest deleted for brevity]
I think this is a long standing bug in something or other.
I think we keep chipping pieces away, and the symptoms keep changing.
Originally, this was a fatal panic caused by a bug in the AHA1542 reset code.
Someone changed something between test-1 and test-5, and now instead
of causing a scsi reset, it causes the above.
Here's how I [believe] this is triggered...
I was flipping between two mp3's with xmms that happened to be on different
cdroms in my cd changer.  I think the start of both files ended up in
cache, so I was playing the cached part of the mp3 on disk 5 while disk 3 was 
loaded.  When it ran out of cached data, it had to suddenly change disks.
The disk change process is lengthy--between 3 and 6 seconds plus spin
down and spin up time.  Rapid changes between disks or any other cdrom
related activity that doesn't happen immediately seems to reliably cause
problems.  (I suspect scanning the sectors of a disk in reverse order
(requiring frequent lengthy seeks) also would cause this, but I've yet
to test it.)
In previous kernels, I would get scsi bus resets until the offending
process was killed, or the cdrom was removed from the drive, causing
an I/O error.  Subsequent attempts to access the device in any way puts
the process in uninterruptable disk wait.  Other devices (i.e., other
slots in the same cd changer) work just fine.
In this kernel, instead of bus resets, I got the OOPS above.
This OOPS (unlike previous ones) doesn't seem to be AHA1542 related.
(Maybe all the bugs in that driver leading up to this have finally
been smoothed over enough to find the underlying bug.)
Can someone make sense of this one?
