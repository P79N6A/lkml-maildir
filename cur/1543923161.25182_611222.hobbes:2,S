Please don't declare externs in a .c file, put it in a header file.

Please follow the proper coding style rules as documented in
Documentation/CodingStyle.  Also running the script scrips/checkpatch.pl
would have pointed this out.

All command line paramaters need to be documented in the Documentation
directory.

Now for the main reason.  I really don't understand why this is needed.
Is it only for virtual machines?  Are there drivers in the kernel tree
today that need this functionality?  What breaks if you do not align
these resources?
