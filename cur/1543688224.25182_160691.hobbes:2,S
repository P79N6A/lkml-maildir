You must look at input/input.c at occurrences of repeat_key.
(And afterwards at char/keyboard.c at kbd_event, kbd_keycode.)
You'll see that the current 2.6 code ignores a lot of what the keyboard
is telling us and synthesizes its own events.
What happens in your autorepeat case:
- Press a key, repeat_key is set to its keycode.
  If you keep it pressed then the keyboard repeats are ignored,
  but the kernel generates its own repeats using a timer.
- Press Shift, repeat_key is set to its keycode.
  Now the timer repeat generates repeats of the Shift-down event,
  but that does not generate keyboard input.
But in your autorepeat case the kernel does precisely what the
keyboard also would have done: repeat the last key that was pressed.
Also the hardware keyboard does not send anything after Press A,
Press Shift, Release Shift.
Incidentally, both add_keyboard_randomness() and add_mouse_randomness()
are called - we invent more randomness than one might have thought
at first.

So, the first part of what you say, when true, would be a bug.
But a bug difficult to distinguish from a finger coordination error.
The second part is correct behaviour.
