Yes, it's either that, or you haven't bothered to read what it really
does.  ATTR_UID et.al. are checked in inode_change_ok().  So is
ATTR_MTIME_SET (only owner can explicitly set timestamps).  ATTR_MTIME
is not and *should* *not* be checked there.  Exactly because it's
done as a side effect of many operations with access control of their
own and nothing that could be pushed down into notify_change() path.
Think of e.g. write(2) - by the time you get to notify_change(), you
don't even have a file descriptor.  Just the dentry and process writing
to file doesn't have to have *any* permissions on it.
Hell, _try_ it.  Build the kernel with your patch and without it.
Call utimes() with NULL second argument on a file you have no write
access to.  See if the timestamps change.
