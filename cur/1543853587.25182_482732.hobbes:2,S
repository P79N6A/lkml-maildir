So, who is finally going to _DO_ the work?
Some of you know that I started an atheros driver at
http://bu3sch.de/ath/atheros.git/
It's not really a driver, yet, as nobody got to continue on the specification,
so I was stuck.
Now that it seems to be ok to use these openbsd sources, should I port
them to my driver framework?
I looked over the ar5k code and, well, I don't like it. ;)
I don't really like having a HAL. I'd rather prefer a "real" driver
without that HAL obfuscation.
