If you end up using requeue_task() in the fast path and it is hit frequently 
with your code you'll need to modify requeue_task to be inline as well. 
Currently it is hit only via sched_yield and once every 10 scheduler ticks 
which is why it is not inline. The performance hit will be demonstrable if it 
is hit in every schedule()
