Thats not very compatible, right now if the parent has the caps they flow
to their children. Actually for linux2.2.6 it appears that if ruid=0 or
euid=0 all caps are raised else all caps are droped upon exec.

Then most of the executables would have to be trusted marked in order to
be backwards compatible. if a privledged process calls 'more' and has the
proper pP and pI set, why should it be incapable of passing those on?
The default fI should be pP and there should be an easy way for people
mark binaries to lose caps(elf headers work for me).
A smart caller will filter out what can be inheritied.
Dumb semi-legacy ones may leak a little for awhile, however it will be
less than having all_caps allways leaking with what happens with
pure-legacy root. non-root cap-enhanced are forced to raise pI if the want
their children to inherite those privledges.
I am developing a model that is fairly backwards compatible but able to
have fine-grained privledges.
To do so root is still special in very limited ways.
That is tweakable via the securebits.
Current root specialness:
1. suid root raises all caps in default compatible mode
   Hopefully someone will make an better more finegrained method like
   putting that info in ext3.
2. special cap_emulate_setxuid stuff used which has default capability
baggage associated with it.
3. euid root's children pI'=pI euid-non-root pI'=0
non-roots must explictly raise pI stuff if they want their children to
inherite anything.
root processes have been effectively weakened.
non-root cap-enhanced possible.
I need to track down the chmod syscall stuff and maybe put a little more
restrictions on what is needed to chmod +s on a root owned file.
I hope to have it work out to be fairly compatible for root-running
processes that maybe weakened. non-root cap-enhanced processes will be
forced to use a new api to accomplish some of the same things as a
legacy-root . ie. have their children inherite caps from them.

The spec has been withdrawn. I might be taking quite a few liberties with
it -- I like the spec makes a good springboard. Maybe the latest patch
will indicate a little better what I have in my mind. Tell me what doesn't
make sense about it. BTW most of the elf header stuff originated from
pavel.
