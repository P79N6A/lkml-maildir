Subject: Interphase Tachyon drivers missing.

I went to upgrade my kernel on a couple of boxes yesterday and noticed
that the Interphase Tachyon chipset Fibre Channel driver was removed
from the kernel.  I think 2.6.1 was the last one it was still in.  Was
there a reason it was pulled?
If not, do I have to volunteer to put it back in or can someone with
more skill re-add it?
