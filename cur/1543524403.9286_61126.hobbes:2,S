The changes in VFS should actually be simple, but you'd also also have to
check/change all programs that do
sprintf(path,"%s/%s",dir,file);
$path = $dir."/".$file;
path=$dir/$file
path = dir "/" file;
canonical_path = *path == '/' ? path : sprintf(buf,"%s/%s",getcwd(NULL,0),path);
etc.
(Even if only // is magic, but //foo isn't.)
Good luck, Y2K was easy in comparison ;-)
