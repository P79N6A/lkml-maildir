Please don't do that. The Cyclades driver supports both ISA and PCI cards,
and it follows correctly the current definition, by ioremap'ing addresses
above 1MB and using readX/writeX for _all_ accesses to MMIO resources (in
ISA or PCI). Doing this change would mean having to test which card I'm
accessing _every time_ I do a readX/writeX, which is completelly
unacceptable (for obvious performance reasons).
