   Would you consider these for each arch as there are coresponding one for
   IOMIO, and life would be better if we had a standard set for MMIO.
   Please consider the request.
The only reason insl() exists is because the x86 has special
instructions to perform that operation.
It used to be an optimization when cpus were really slow.
No cpu to my knowledge has special instructions to readsl et al.  and
on no cpu would be faster than a hand coded loop.
In fact I would instead vote to delete {in,out}s{b,w,l}() and friends.
