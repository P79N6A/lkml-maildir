I'm using the 2.6.0-test9 kernel and initramfs to store video mode data 
that my kernel mods will read during boot.  Using cpio is a lot easier 
than making a file system using the loopback device.   I want to keep 
the rootfs around since I can modify it and then cpio it back up in a 
shutdown script for next boot.
If I used initrd I'd also have to set up a usable filesystem.  This way 
I can just have data in there.
