It hasn't traditionally been "common code". The old SCSI layer has various
fixed timeouts, many of them on the order of 2-5 minutes, and none of them
target-specific.
Some of them are effectively turned off - the format timeout was increased
to 2 hours to make sure that it basically never triggers.
But never fear, we'll have some common routines for error handling.  But
they will be library routines, NOT the current crap.

Ehh.. IDE disks take SCSI commands, and do most error recovery entirely in
disk firmware. There is very little you can do about most errors there.
Don't think "SCSI" as in SCSI controllers. Think SCSI as in "fairly
generic packet protocol that somehow infiltrated most things".

It's called "struct block_device" and "struct genhd". The pointers will
have as many bits as pointers have on the architecture. Low-level drivers
will not even see anything else eventually, there will be no "numbers".
