When working on lguest64, I implemented a "per CPU" shadow page. That the
process of a guest running on one real CPU, could never see this page for
a process of the same guest running on another real CPU.
This is a nightmare to manage.  The thing is that threads share the same
pgd. With shadow pages, it's doable, but hard to manage. It required
making a "copy" of the pgd for each real CPU.
Here we are not talking about guests, but bare-metal.  So this complicates
things even more. The problem is that each thread shares the same pgd. If
two threads run on the same time on two different CPUS, then the two
threads would see the same counter. But we need to make this per cpu.
Now if the thread was given a clue to what CPU it was running on, then we
might be able to accomplish something. But then we have the same issue.
How do you tell a thread what CPU it's on, without running into the same
issues as where to store this data?
