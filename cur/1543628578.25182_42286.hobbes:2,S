Hi Denis-
Yes, kstat_read_proc() in linux/fs/proc/proc_misc.c is
racing with the timer tick interrupt handler,
especially given your test_badidle2 script..
(I modified it to print only "error" conditions.)
I don't know how important it is to fix this, but
adding a lock at the beginning of kstat_read_proc()
allows it to run overnight with a problem [for me,
on UP].
BTW, idle shouldn't be blamed for going backwards,
since it's just the leftover time after adding
user + nice + system.  ;)
I don't recall what kernel version you are using, but
here's a patch to 2.4.18.

No.
