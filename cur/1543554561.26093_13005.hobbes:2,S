      Maybe i were not enough exact, but i`ve meant
   addition of some intelligence to tweaking /proc
   e.g. something what automates tuning, not only
   providing interface to such actions.
      But after lookthru ptweaks source i realized
   what its ONLY interface (to proc), and MAYBE
   it does some PCI tuning (really intelligent 
   choices to advance system`s performance).
      BTW powertweak is a port from unfamous MD,
   therefore when it was created NO proc tuning
   was in mind...
      There is another argument, telling what doing        autotune is ugly by design.... but thats another        issue.
   Sorry for poor english/lameness
