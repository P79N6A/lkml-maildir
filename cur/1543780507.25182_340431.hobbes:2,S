Hello Xavier.
Thanks for replying.
I checked that the /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory is already set to 0.
In my case the problem is that I don't have many options like changing
the overcommit_memory etc.
Only thing I need to do is, have a proper cleanup will exiting the application.  As the application is receiving SIKILL from OMM killer the required signal handler is not getting called and no cleanup is happening.
So could you please suggest me that what could be done in this regard.
Thanks and Regards
Vinay.
