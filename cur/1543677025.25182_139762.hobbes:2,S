I got it all figured out now.
It is a divide by zero in update_write_batch() called from
as_completed_request().

I reproduced it without X.
The divide by zero is on line 959 with the divide by 'write_time'. It
can obviously be zero (see line 950). The divide by 'batch' on line 953
seems safe.
The correct patch is below.
Most important question: why are only some of us seeing this?
