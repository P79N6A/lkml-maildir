Sorry, but this argument is fallacious. Sure, a SCHED_IDLE process can
grab some userspace semaphore and then never get any time
slices. However, it can also grab some userspace semaphore and then
never release it, even now --- and the same effect results. It can also
be SIGSTOPped, which does the same thing again (and also doesn't affect
stuff in kernel space, for obvious reasons).
We can safely assume that kernel space will not do that, but we cannot
assume that userspace won't.
The only difference is that now users can trigger this effect, as well
as program bugs.
I agree that a process in kernel space must always be non-SCHED_IDLE, or
perhaps that SCHED_IDLE is treated as SCHED_OTHER as long as a process
is in kernel mode. But banning it in userspace because of userspace
locks is wrong. (Consider that most processes that are likely to be
SCHED_IDLE will spend nearly all their time in userspace, so banning
kernel-space SCHED_IDLE will have negligible effect on the performance
improvement achieved by this code.)
(IMHO, of course. ICBW.)
