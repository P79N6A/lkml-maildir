I decided to have another play with USB and a Creative Webcam II
(cpia based) -- is the past I've never had any success, only oopsen.
With pre-2.3.46-3 I don't get oopsen anymore, but I do get a
complaint that the device won't accept a new address -- is this a bug
of a flaw in the camera or something competely different?
I have tried with both uhci drivers; uhci.o:
usb.c: registered new driver usbdevfs
usb.c: registered new driver hub
usb.c: registered new driver cpia
uhci.c: detected 2 ports
usb.c: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
usb.c: USB new device connect, assigned device number 1
usb.c: kmalloc IF c777dd80, numif 1
usb.c: new device strings: Mfr=0, Product=0, SerialNumber=0
hub.c: USB hub found
hub.c: 2 ports detected
hub.c: ganged power switching
hub.c: standalone hub
hub.c: global over-current protection
hub.c: power on to power good time: 2ms
hub.c: hub controller current requirement: 0mA
hub.c: port 1 is removable
hub.c: port 2 is removable
hub.c: local power source is good
hub.c: no over-current condition exists
hub.c: enabling power on all ports
usb.c: usb-bandwidth-alloc: was: 0, new: 17, bustime = 17 us, Pipe allowed: yes
usb.c: bw_alloc bumped to 17 for 1 requesters
usb.c: hub driver claimed interface c777dd80
