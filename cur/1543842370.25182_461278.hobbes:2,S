I think using larger cacheline value should be okay for both 
prefetchable and non-prefetchable memory.  Using larger value tells the 
device to be more conservative in issuing MRL, MRW or WMI.  As Russell 
has pointed out, cacheline-wrapping access wouldn't work but I think 
it's reasonable to expect for such device to be flexible about cacheline 
config.

arch/i386/pci/common.c overrides cacheline size to min 32 regardless of 
actual size.  So, we seem to be using larger cacheline size for MWI already.
Jeff pointed out that there actually are devices which limit CLS config. 
  IMHO, making PCI configure CLS automatically and provide helpers to 
LLD to override it if necessary should cut it.
Thanks.
