I just tried 2.1.132-ac2, by fetching the linux-2.1.132 source in full and
applying the ac2 patch on top.  I still get the same errors.
If you look at the top of arch/alpha/lib/stxcpy.S, do you see a line
including <alpha/regdef.h>?  Could you find out where that file is
actually coming from?  The only regdef.h in the tree is in asm-mips, as
far as I can tell.
Thanks,
Tim.
