Current tools won't recognize a file belonging to jschmoe as hers, quotas
will go haywire too.

When old kernel executes program that has just the capability to bind to a
low port, it is now suddenly all-powerfull...
This kind of idea _mandates_ at _least_ a new executable format all
around. Remember the a.out --> ELF pain? The screwups libc5 --> libc6? And
all to ease/postpone the pain of introducing capabilities into the FS? No,
thanks.

Any ACL system is inherently distinctly un-Unix-ish, IMHO. Better bite that
bullet once now and get it over with.
