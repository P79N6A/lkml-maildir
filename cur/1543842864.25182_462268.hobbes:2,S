Oh, I didn't even notice that we do that by default already. That's a bit 
scary - I remember people having their disks trashed.
Maybe the broken disks are old enough to not be an issue any more, or 
maybe something else makes it effectively impossible to trigger in 
practice?
You do need to get 32 pages of contiguous IO for it to happen, and while I 
don't see anything else that would limit it, maybe there is something that 
does? (Some other limiter like max_phys_segments might, but that 
particular one defaults to much more than 32)
Of course, we do hopefully handle requests that fail a lot more 
gracefully these days, so if the drive says it didn't do it, maybe we just 
fix it up properly, in a way we didn't use to.. Ie we may have fixed the 
thing that caused corruption just by fixing something else ;)
