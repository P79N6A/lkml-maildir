I just chatted with Christoph about this.  For some reason we thought
all instances of direct count use were in debug code (or were put into
debug-only code), but we missed the one in xfs_inode_item_pushbuf.  It
only needs to know if count > 0, so we could implement that using the
down_trylock primitive, but it'd be pretty ugly.
It looks like a couple of the arch's have now got a sem_getcount, and
Christoph is planning on reviving an earlier patch to provide that API
across all architectures, and then we can change XFS to use that.
cheers.
