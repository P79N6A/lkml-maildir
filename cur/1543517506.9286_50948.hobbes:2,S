we cannot rename the user space structures:
msqid_ds,... are predefined names from the SUS standard, we
must rename the kernel structures.
and: I don't know if the new version or the old version should
be the default:
Many applications don't care about the uid field,
but with your patch applied, all recompiled programs
would fail on 2.2 kernels.
But I agree that we must change something (the user space
code that I use to increase the message queue size > 64 kB
is "interesting")

or: we could replace the "copy_to_user()" functions.
ie. "copy_semid_ds_to_user(src,dest,version)"
version=0 -> automatically convert
version=1 -> normal copy_to_user
