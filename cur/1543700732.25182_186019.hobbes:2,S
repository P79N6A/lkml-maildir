Much thanks. That seems to do it, tested lightly so far with two 
onboards (asus p4c800e, and supermicro X5DPL-IGM-0) using both kernels 
2.6.0 and 2.4.23, e1000-5.2.22, stats updates are much faster and seem 
more accurate. Will test with some PCI-X cards in the office tommorow, 
where I can really do some pounding.
