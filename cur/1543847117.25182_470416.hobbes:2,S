This is possible via a hardware interrupt. HPET chips and also the PIT 
provide the ability to schedule an ihterrupts in the future. The periodic 
timer tick is such a mechanism that is also used by the scheduler to 
preempt processes. If the interrupt has sufficiently high priority then 
you could avoid many interrupt holdoffs. However, you may not be able to 
do much since you have no process context. Plus this may be nothing else 
than duplicating already existing functionality.
