Local labels work forwards as well as backwards:
 #define LOCK 
 	 	".section .lock.init,\"a\"\n" \
 		".align 4\n"\
 		".long 1f\n"\
 		".previous\n" 
		"1: lock ; \n"
I recommend not using "1" for your label, though, because probably
other bits of code that use locks have local loops in them.  It's to be
expected... just pick a less common number.
