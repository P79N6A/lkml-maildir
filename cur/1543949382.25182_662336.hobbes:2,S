Is it possible to teach Thunderturd to NOT munge the cc line?  It
stripped names from cc addresses, and here when that happens the message
lands (intentionally) in my spam grinder.  I just happened to see this
one before flushing, but now, thanks to Thunderturd, every follow-up
will also land there.  (well, not any more since I restored it)
