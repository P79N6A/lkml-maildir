Processes expecting time to increase strictly monotonically across process
boundaries will enjoy life in cluster settings or when the admin adjusts the
time.
In short, those programs are already broken.
Of course, physically that should be true, Star Trek or not ;), but it is a
really hard promise to keep across multiple nodes (think Mosix, CC/NC-NUMA or
even real clusters which distributed processing).
Serializing all gettimeofday() calls via a single counter at least is a rather
bad idea.
