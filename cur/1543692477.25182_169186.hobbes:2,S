Ok. I'll do that then.

I'd certainly like to see such additions somehow implemented as optional
extras. The core functionality ought not be a great monolithic mass.

I've had enquiries about adding support for UML, NFS and encryption
support; they would match well with your desire for a more general
solution.

Yes; I have a pretty clear distinction between the code for freezing
processes and syncing data and that which actually saves the data.

Great. I'll start the work in earnest tomorrow. Today I'm packing up
