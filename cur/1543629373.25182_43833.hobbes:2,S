Hmm strange, please send me your .config so I can see some more facts
about your setup.

We timed out waiting for an interrupt for service or dma completion.
Damn, I forgot to print which one. Please change that printk in
drivers/ide/ide-tcq.c:ide_tcq_intr_timeout() to:
	printk("ide_tcq_intr_timeout: timeout waiting for %s interrupt...\n",
		hwgroup->rq ? "completion" : "service");
and reproduce!

Ok, so a service check produced nothing for the drive (ok, odds are good
this is a completion interrupt timeout), so we proceeded to invalidate
the block tag queue.

And apparently one of the request on the tag queue had no tag assigned,
very odd. This means someone else ended it, but it didn't get cleared.
Hmm. This is probably your problem, I'll have to think about this.
[snip oops]
At least part of the decode seems bogus (eip should be
blk_queue_end_tag...) and the last traces should be ide_tcq_intr_timeout
-> ide_tcq_invalidate_queue -> blk_queue_invalidate_tags
Thanks for testing!
