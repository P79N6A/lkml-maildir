I'm wondering what you all do to minimize the amount of disk
space it takes to be mucking with the kernel?
I've got a pristine 2.2.14 tree installed, as well as 3 copies of
it all slightly modified.  Add to that 2.3.x and I'm almost out
of disk space.
Any suggestions as to how to minimize the space, considering a
lot of the files are dupes?
I was thinking of making my pristine tree's "immutable", and
hardlinking or symlinking the files in another dir, and then only
copying the changed files.
Would this work?  Would I be able to build ok?
Any ideas and suggestions appreciated!
Thanks in advance!
