I agree, that this is an important aspect and for your kind of work it's 
absolutely necessary.
But source management is more than just distributing and merging changes. 
E.g. if I want to develop a driver, I would start like most people from a 
stable base, that means 2.4. At a certain point the development splits 
into a development and stable branch, eventually I also want to merge my 
driver into the 2.5 tree.
This means I have to deal with 5 different source trees (branches), two 
branches track external trees and I want to know what has been merged from 
my development into my 2.4 and 2.5 stable branches, which I can use to 
make official releases. I want to be able to push multiple changes as a 
single change into the stable branches and it should be able to tell me 
which changes are still left.
If there would be a free SCM system, which could do this, I could easily 
do without a distributed option. Although I think as soon as it would be 
this far it should be relatively easy to add a distribution mechanism (by 
using a separate branch, which is only used for pulling changes). OTOH I 
suspect that it will be very hard to add the other capabilities to bk 
without a major redesign, as it's not a simple hierarchic structure 
anymore.
bye, Roman
