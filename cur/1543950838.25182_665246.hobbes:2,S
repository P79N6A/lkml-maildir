What network workload? Networking tends to have a lot of cache misses
and unless you're exceeding your memory bandwidth HT normally does 
well on such workloads because it can do other things while the 
CPU is waiting for loads.

There's nothing more recent out yet (unless you're talking non x86), 
but there were many different P4 generations. In particular Prescott
(90nm) was quite different from the earlier ones, but even before
and after there were some improvements and changes.
