It's a popular value.
stat: in bytes, between vsize and rss_rlim
statm: in pages, between size and share
status:  in KiB as VmRSS

Sure. That's not because of RSS. It's for TRS and DRS,
which are supposed to be RSS-like values specific to
text (code) and data.
The VM size of text is TSIZ, and of data is DSIZ.
These numbers, while useful, are not the same thing.

A user can configure top to display other columns if
he has a box that can't handle /proc/*/statm well.
The file will not be read if it is not needed.
Start top, then do:
f     enters field modification screen
o     disable VIRT
q     disable RES
t     disable SHR
n     disable %MEM
enter exits field modification screen
W     writes a ~/.toprc file
So, what is the problem again?  :-)

Well, as long as it makes the users happy... I don't personally
care, except to say that I don't care to document all sorts
of kernel-specific variations. It gets hopelessly messy.
