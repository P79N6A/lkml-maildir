It appears that the different clustering groups are all involved.  As I
said, we're committed to making this useful for everyone.  Our approach
from the start has been to copy the "standard" dlm api available on other
operating systems (in particular VMS); there's never been a tie to one
application.  We're also trying to make the behaviour configurable at
points where there are useful differences in the dlm's people are
accustomed to.
Other groups will obviously not be able to adopt this dlm immediately, but
the goal is for them to be _able_ to do so eventually -- if they want and
when time permits.  If anyone is _unable_ to use this dlm for some
technical reason, we'd definately like to know about that now so it can be
fixed.
Thanks,
Dave
