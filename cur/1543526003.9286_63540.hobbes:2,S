  Hi, all. I've been noticing odd behaviour with named pipes under
recent 2.3.x kernels (at least since 2.3.36 and possibly before).
If you open a FIFO with O_RDONLY and then call read(2), and then
another process writes to the FIFO, the read(2) call doesn't return. A
subsequent writer process does wake up the reader, however.
Has anybody else noticed this behaviour?
				Regards,
