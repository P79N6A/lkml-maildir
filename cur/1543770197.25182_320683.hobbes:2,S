Well, you'll have to add measurement of any security-sensitive config
file, any script, and will have to make sure that all parsing of
system config files does not contain buffer-overrun problems. That's
lot of work before IMA is usefull. It is true you do not make
situation any worse.
Good luck and go ahead.
