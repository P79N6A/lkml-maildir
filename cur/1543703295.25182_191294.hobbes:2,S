Subject: 2.6 NFS stale filehandle with subtree_check

	Hello all,
	I have a NFS fileserver (currently based on XFS on 3ware RAID),
which I have tried to upgrade to 2.6. kernel. After reboot, clients
started to see partial directories, or cannot open/create files in
their cwd, with the "stale NFS file handle" message. Using no_subtree_check
option in /etc/exports helped, as well as going back to 2.4+XFS.
	It is probably not XFS related, because I had the same problem
on an older HW of this server (which had an ext3 volumes on software RAID)
and some 2.6.0-pre kernel. At that time I did not know that I had to try
no_subtree_check, so I don't know whether this would have fixed the
problem on the older HW. I went back to 2.4 then.
	The machine serves the home directories via NFS and Samba.
I have home directories for ~2200 users there, each one with its own
/etc/exports entry[1]. NFS clients are various Linux, Solaris and IRIX
workstations and servers.
	Is it possible to use subtree_check in NFS in 2.6? Thanks,
-Yenya
