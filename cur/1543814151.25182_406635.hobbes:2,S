Before (in 2.6.16-rc*):
$ egrep 'ibmphp' /proc/modules
ibmphp 67809 4294967295 - Live 0xf8910000
             ^^^^^^^^^^
After [1]:
ibmphp 64224 0 - Live 0xf8965000
             ^
Of course, now I'm able to successfully unload ibmphp
(& subsequently load it too :)) without any
observeable problems.
It'd seem, thro struct hotplug_slot_ops, module ref
count for ibmphp is taken care of. No?
Correct me, if I'm completely wrong here. Perhaps,
there may be a better way to address this that I'm
unaware of. If so, enlighten me.
I'm afraid I've no hardware to verify whether the
patch introduces any regressions.
Thanks
