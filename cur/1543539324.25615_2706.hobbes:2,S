Subject: route source ignored?

In recent kernels, adding the src directive for routes has no effect.
The packets exit with the IP of the interface they are exiting.
Is this intentional?  It breaks a few things.
e.g.:
    ip route add 208.179.0.0/24 dev gre1 src 208.179.68.72
The IP of the interface the GRE packets exit is 68.66.  The tunnel is
configured with the local address of .72.  When the kernel allows
packets to exit, they come with the source of .66 instead of .72
Most of the time the following appear if I set the tunnel local address
of .66 and there's no communication with the tunnel peer.
Jul 20 03:48:14 ns kernel: NET: 77 messages suppressed.
Jul 20 03:48:14 ns kernel: ipgre_tunnel_xmit: ip_send() failed, err=1
Strangely however, sometimes the tunnel does work and readily transmits
packets with .66.
The current kernel this machine is on is test4-pre6.
