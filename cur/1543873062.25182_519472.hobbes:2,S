While we are at it, is there a reason we call return_serial() late in the
sequence? Making sure the device is not reopened should be the
first measure. Are we protected by hanging up the tty?
Secondly, what is this code supposed to do:
	for (i = 0; i < serial->num_ports; ++i)
		serial->port[i]->open_count = 0;
If we get to destroy_serial(), how can ports still be open?
	Regards
