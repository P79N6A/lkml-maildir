gcc2.96 miscompiles eg sys_fork(), one workaround is:
  # turn off broken sibling call optimizations
  CFLAGS += $(shell if $(CC) -fno-optimize-sibling-calls -S -o /dev/null -xc /dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "-fno-optimize-sibling-calls"; fi)
After noticing this, i didn't look any further; so this may not be the
only problem.
