ASCII strings require no special tools to manipulate from shell scripts.

The design does allow users to store whatever they want as an xattr
without having to worry about how the kernel chooses to interpret it,
though. (i.e. the user namespace is just a byte array that the kernel
stores for you, while the system/security namespaces are probably
generated and interpreted on demand.)
