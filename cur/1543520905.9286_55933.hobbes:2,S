   I recently compiled 2.3.36 to find this error when the pppd was called:
       (root)[~]#ppp-go
       (root)[~]#Serial connection established.
       ioctl(TIOCSETD): Invalid argument(22)
Are you sure you compiled in PPP support?  This smells like PPP support
wasn't compiled in, OR PPP support was compiled as a module, and the PPP
module wasn't installed properly.
