to make it working with more than one device shouldn't be hard once it

Will ask the vendor, what's going on.

Yeah, you seem to sound right.

The register offset is according to the device specs. Of course i
already found some wrong offsets etc, maybe this one's wrong too, probably.

Working with this device, under NDA with the vendor.

Cool, won't be that long, just the bridge part remains, most other parts
are done or do exist.
