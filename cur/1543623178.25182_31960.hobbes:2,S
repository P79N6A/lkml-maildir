Hi,
    I have a question on the rmap VM.  What is the swap requierment for it?
I remember the previous Rik van Riel VM required twice the amount of
swapspace as memory to run effectively as many people were complaining about
that.  I read a while ago that the switch in 2.4.10 to the new AA VM fixed
that issue.  Will rmap bring back that 2x requirement?  Thanks.
