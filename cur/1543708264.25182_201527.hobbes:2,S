OK got the hint. ;)
I'll repeat my recommendation that OMACs be computed at the same time as
encryption/decryption and not in a "two pass" approach like this.  Ideally by
passing two cipher contexts (one for encryption other for MACing) into
functions like cbc_encrypt() - alas I'm too nervous with this API to
implement that.
A Not-So-Ideal compromise would be using the same cipher context and
storing the MAC in a new member of the cipher_tfm struct.  This would require
minimal amount of new code to test and will probably go faster as well.
The two patches are:
 - 
http://jlcooke.ca/lkml/ctr_and_omac.patch
   (added ctr to cipher.c and omac.c)
   Using the init/update/final interface.
 - 
http://jlcooke.ca/lkml/ctr_and_omac2.patch
   (added ctr to cipher.c and integrated OMAC into all
   existing modes of operation. If cipher_tfm.cit_omac!=NULL, OMAC is stored
   into cipher_tfm.cit_omac)
   So in other words, current implementations using the CryptoAPI will not see
   performance change and no new .c files.
    No OMAC:
      tfm = crypto_alloc_tfm (algo, CRYPTO_TFM_MODE_CBC);
    With OMAC:
      tfm = crypto_alloc_tfm (algo, CRYPTO_TFM_MODE_CBC | CRYPTO_TFM_MODE_OMAC);
      ...
      crypto_cipher_get_omac(tfm, omac_val, 128/8);
    ** J-L likes this one more! **
Now implementing CCM mode (the final mode of operation specified for use with
AES by NIST) will be my next task.   CCM is an IEEE standard and is going
through the motions of becoming a FIPS standard as well.  Reference:
  
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/Draft_SP_800-38C_9-04-2003.pdf
It's effectively CTR mode with a CBC MAC at the end of it.  I'll start
implementing it, but we'll hold off until the spec is out of draft.

ps. Will crypto_cipher_encrypt/crypto_cipher_decrypt *always* be called in
onesies?  I need to perform come final() code on the OMAC before it's
ready to pass test vectors - how do I know when we're done?
