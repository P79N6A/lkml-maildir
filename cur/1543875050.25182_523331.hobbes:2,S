there's a new post-rc4 regression: my T60 hangs during early bootup. I 
bisected the hang down to this recent commit:
| commit 25496caec111481161e7f06bbfa12a533c43cc6f
| Author: Thomas Renninger <trenn@suse.de>
| Date:   Tue Feb 27 12:13:00 2007 -0500
|
|    ACPI: Only use IPI on known broken machines (AMD, Dothan/BaniasPentium M)
undoing this change fixes my T60 so it correctly boots again.
the commit has this confidence-raising comment:
|   However, I am not sure about the naming of the parameter and how it 
|   could/should get integrated into the dyntick part 
|   (CONFIG_GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS). There, a more fine grained check (TSC 
|   still running?, ..) is needed?
could we please revert this commit until it's done correctly?
and did this end up being a 'fix'? The change weakens the scope of a 
hardware workaround, which IMO has no place so late in the cycle. At a 
minimum the clockevents maintainer (Thomas) should have been Cc:-ed on 
it.
