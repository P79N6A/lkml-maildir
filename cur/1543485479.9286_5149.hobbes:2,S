With reprogramming PICs we you map IRQs to the right places. As far as I know
these mappings are :
Under MSDOS (default BIOS setting) :   0x08..0x0F, 0x70..0x78 (this second intervall may not be correct, sorry ...)
Under Linux (reprogrammed PICs)    :   0x20..0x27, 0x28..0x2F
(See /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/setup.S)
