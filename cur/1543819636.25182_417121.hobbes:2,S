Hi Roman,
I have a few questions about this patch series.  All of them are
about using *config (i.e., this is not a patch review).
~~~~~
Subject: [PATCH 12/19] kconfig: add symbol option config syntax
Do we have any examples of this?  (where)
~~~~~
Subject: [PATCH 14/19] kconfig: Add search option for xconfig
How do I search?  I don't see it in the menu or any Help for it.
~~~~~
Subject: [PATCH 15/19] kconfig: finer customization via popup menus
How?  documentation?
~~~~~
Subject: [PATCH 16/19] kconfig: create links in info window
How?  what does link look like?  are there any in the current
Kconfig menus?  I'd like to see one (or several).
~~~~~
Subject: [PATCH 17/19] kconfig: jump to linked menu prompt
I'd like to see this too.  Where can I see it?
~~~~~
Thanks,
