No nasties in the syslog.  System usage from top averages 50% per 
CPU.  (By system I mean kernel usage, bounces between 70 and 30 per 
CPU)

Gotcha, yes that could definetly be.  This was extraordinarily 
unscientific.  I was thinking maybe someone had seen something else 
like this on this platform.  So, I'll write a test that isolates 
ethernet from other stuff like ide performance, etc.

Will do when I return.
Thanks,
Shane Nay.
(Someone else noted their /proc/interrupts for the same machine, but 
my box had only been up for 1.5 hours :)
