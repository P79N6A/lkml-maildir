A similar race has been reported for cpuset_migrate_mm(), which is
called holding the cgroup_mutex and further calls do_migrate_pages,
which can call reclaim and thus try to acquire cgroup_lock. If we
avoid reclaiming pages with cpuset_migrate_mm(), as the first patch
did, it also solves the reported race.

Looks good to me
