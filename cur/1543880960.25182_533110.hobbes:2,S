Yes, the whole driver model :)
When adding a new device, we always grab a reference to the parent
device so it can not go away before we do.
Look at the last kobject_put(parent); in kobject_cleanup() which ensures
this.

Ick, no, I think this used to be the way things worked, but bad things
would end up happening, so we fixed it up to be the way things are
today.  Read the comments for the changelog for this file for details.
Specifically, look at commit 10921a8f1305b8ec97794941db78b825db5839bc
in the history.git repo which is almost exactly what you are proposing
to be reverted...
thanks,
