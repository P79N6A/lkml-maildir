Would be useful.  The "fscking" problem is that no one actually owns the
documents, so there's no central focus to keep them up to date.
Maybe we need a docfsck? 8)
I certainly don't have authority to tell x86 people not to use ksymoops.
Therefore, I think my suggested change (which up until recently I thought
was an ARM only problem) should be done by someone else.
