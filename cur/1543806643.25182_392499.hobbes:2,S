No, but I don't use an initrd, so my failure was first that it couldn't
recognize my harddrives.  So I compiled in the necessary drivers into my
kernel, and it booted right up to the GDM login.  I logged in, and was
going to reply to you, but I guess I have a different network card since
I had no network.

Thanks, I've been burnt before with incompatible modules in initrd, that
I now only use compiled in modules that are needed to boot (ide, ext3,
etc).  When compiling 3 different kernels with several different configs
constantly for the same machine, it just becomes easier to not use an
initrd.
