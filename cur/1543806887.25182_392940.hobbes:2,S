I have problems with ide-floppy.
Do not know if they are specific to this latest release, as I did not use
my ZIP drive since long ago...Now I tried to make a boot zip with grub.
I inserted a mac floppy, partitioned it as hdb1, and as soon as fdisk wrote
the partition table and forced a reread, the system began to scan the
zip like crazy, and nothing appears on /proc/partitions ...
Ejected the disk, rmmod ide-floppy, insert the disk and everything is quiet.
As soon as insmod ide-floppy, the party starts on syslog:
ide-floppy driver 0.99.newide
hdb: 244766kB, 489532 blocks, 512 sector size
hdb: 244736kB, 239/64/32 CHS, 4096 kBps, 512 sector size, 2941 rpm
hdb: The disk reports a capacity of 250640384 bytes, but the drive only handles 250609664
hdb: The disk reports a capacity of 250640384 bytes, but the drive only handles 250609664
hdb: hdb1

Funny...
Some truncation error anywhere ?
