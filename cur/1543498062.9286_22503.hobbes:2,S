Hi all,
I just upgraded my home box to Red Hat 6.0 and noticed a strange thing. 
Earlier I was running RH 5.2 with 2.2.9 kernel, ide-cd was compiled as a
module and worked fine. RH 6.0 comes with 2.2.5 kernel with ide-cd
compiled into the kernel. I recompiled 2.2.9 kernel under RH6.0 and ide-cd
module seized loading. When compiled into the kernel, ide-cd works. I
wonder what might be perculiar with RH6.0? Other modules (sound, scsi) 
don't show any problems.
Is it a known issue or have I tackled with something new?
Thanks, Kastus
