   Actually, there has been several reports that turning header
   compression does help.
If this is what is causing the TCP sequence numbers to change
then either Win98's or Earthlink terminal server's implementation
of TCP header compression is buggy.
Assuming this is true, it explains why Win98's TCP does not "see" the
data sent by Linux, because such a bug would make the TCP checksum of
these packets incorrect and thus dropped by Win98's TCP.
