Our pty driver basically creates a virtual serial TTY on the slave side 
which 
will allow the application to control a remote device server serial port 
across a LAN network.  The application can control things like baud rate,
parity, stop bits, HW & SW flow control, and monitor and control modem 
signals. 
Below are some defines that would explain how we extended the base pty.
One note is the our diver is based on the legacy/bsd pty not the unix98
pty, so if it was decided that this extension was to be merged into the
base pty then the code would have to be ported to the unix98 sections as
well.
/* 
   There aren't enough bits available in tty->ctrl_status for the events 
that
   we need to signal to the daemon, so we will use 1 bit to indicate that
   the daemon needs to make an IOCTL (PTX_IOCXCSGET) to get the real 
status.
