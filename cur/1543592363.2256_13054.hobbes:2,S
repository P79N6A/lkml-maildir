Personally, I'd like to see these every month or so, so
the bugs will go away within a month of their introduction.
Ideally, there never should be a large batch of any kind
of automatically checked bugs, except when a new check is
introduced...
OTOH, splitting them up may be a good idea, especially if
the email with the bug in it is CC'd to the person who is
listed in MAINTAINERS as taking care of that part of the
kernel ;)
regards,
Rik
