One of my tasks is to document all the assumptions in hte comapt code
(and there a a few - and I find more as I go :-)).  However, could you
elaborate a bit here - do you mean passing 64 bit pointers from user mode?

I was going to elaborate on this when I sent the x86_64 part of the patch.
If you read the "normal" kernel fcntl function, it does NOT accept
F_GETLK64, F_SETLK64 or F_SETLKW64 through the fcntl sys call only
through the fcntl64 syscall.  So any program that does call the old
style fcntl() with one of those will fail on ia32 - which is what you are
trying to emulate.
Cheers,
Stephen
