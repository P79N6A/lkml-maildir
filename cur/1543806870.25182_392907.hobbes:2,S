We gave a name to such containers. We call them 'application' containers
just to make a difference with the 'system' containers, like vserver or openvz.
'application' containers are very useful in an HPC environment where you
can trig checkpoint/restart through batch managers. But, this model,
really, has some virtualization issues on the edge. The virtualisation of
the parent process of such a container is tricky, it can be in multiple
containers at the same time, it can die (difficult to restart ...), it
could belong to another process groups, etc. Plenty of annoying cases to
handle.
'system' containers, like vserver or openvz, are safer because they use a
private PID space.
Now, would it be possible to have an 'application' container using a
private PID space and being friendly to the usual unix process semantics ?
We haven't found a solution yet ...

yes and you could restrict that privilege to some top level container, like
the container 0.
