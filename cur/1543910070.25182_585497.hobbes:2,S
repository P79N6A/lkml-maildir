Well, it has only been false since December 2006.  Prior to that
atomics *were* volatile on all platforms.

Indeed.  I believe that most uses of atomic_read other than in polling
loops or debug printk statements are actually racy.  In some cases the
race doesn't seem to matter, but I'm sure there are cases where it
does.

Why use locks when you can just sprinkle magic fix-the-races dust (aka
atomic_t) over your code? :) :)

Conceptually it is, because atomic_t is specifically for variables
which are liable to be modified by other CPUs, and volatile _means_
"liable to be changed by mechanisms outside the knowledge of the
compiler".

Well, in one sense it's not that hard - Linus did it just 8 months ago
in commit f9e9dcb3. :)

0.0008% increase in kernel text size on powerpc according to my
measurement. :)

By making something an atomic_t you're saying "other CPUs are going to
be modifying this, so treat it specially".  It's reasonable to assume
that special treatment extends to reading and setting it.

Volatility isn't primarily about reordering (though as Linus says it
does restrict reordering to some extent).
