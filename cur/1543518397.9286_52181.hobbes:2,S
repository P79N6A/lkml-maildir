In the 2.3.31 patch, ioremap checks more vigorously to make sure the
page(s) being remapped are not already in use.
Would it be reasonable to have remap_page_range check and make sure the
pages being remapped are _not_ ioremap'able pages?  This should help
flag code which incorrect uses remap_page_range vs. io_remap_page_range.
