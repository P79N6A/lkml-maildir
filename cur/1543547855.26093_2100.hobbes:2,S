I used lvm.d in my early version, but this is a little bit ugly, too ...

Please don't do it now. I can add a patch that does full-blown devfs
checking to the tools, but this needs a lot of work.
Until then please leave it the old way so people don't have to remount
root just to create the device nodes.
When the new tools are out, they can be put into 'Changes'
as required version and the devfs names can be changed.
