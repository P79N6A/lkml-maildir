I have to agree with Inaky too.  Fundamentally, PI is the same for the
system regardless of if the locks are user or kernel. I still don't see
the difference here.  But for other reasons, I feel that the user lock
should be a different structure from the kernel lock. That's why I
mentioned that it would be a good idea if Ingo modulized the PI portion.
So that part would be the same for both. If he doesn't have the time to
do it, I'll do it :-)  (Ingo, all you need to do is ask.)

I don't think rwlocks work well with PI.  You can implement it, but it's
like implementing multiple inheritance for Object Oriented languages.
Java didn't implement it because they say keeping it out makes the code
cleaner (probably true), but the real reason I bet, was that
implementing it makes everything much more complex.  The same goes with
rwlocks with multiple readers and PI. Without it makes for a cleaner
solution (for users as well as developers), and with it, it just makes
everything more complex.
