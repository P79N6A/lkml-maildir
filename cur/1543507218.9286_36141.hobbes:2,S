Dang. sorry about sending out the last copy with HTML crap attached. I don't
usually post to this list from work. Here it is for those of you that
deleted the last one without looking:
Ok, that subject has probably gotten this message deleted without being
read, but if you've gotten this far...
I've been trying to use my USB mouse in Linux for the last few stable
kernels without luck. I'm currently running 2.2.12 on a dual PII/350, 440BX
system. I enabled CONFIG_USB??? and built the usb-uhci module. I can
modprobe it and it detects my mouse (according to SIGUSR1 on uhci-control),
but I can't get any data from reading /dev/usbmouse (c 10 32). I also can't
open the mouse until I kill -USR1 uhci-control. The interrupt service
registers itself in /proc/interrupts (IO-APIC-edge, irq11), but the
interrupt counters never increment.
This is what I've tried:
I moved uhci_check_configuration above interruptible_sleep_on in
uhci_control_thread. This seemed to fix the problem of not being able to
open /dev/usbmouse until I'd killed -USR1 uhci-control.
I stuck printks at the tops of a lot of functions. What I noticed is
uhci_interrupt is never called. At least, I never see the printk. Can you
printk inside of an interrupt handler?
I think maybe ???_ticktd is failing? The function gets called, and says it
is supposed to cause an interrupt per second on the USB device, but I never
see any interrupts happen.
Any ideas? I realise USB isn't supported in 2.2, but I don't really want to
go to 2.3 just yet... anyone have any ideas what's wrong in the 2.2 code?
ObItWorksInWindows: It works great in Windows 98! :)
Thanks,
Brendan
