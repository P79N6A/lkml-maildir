Not to mention Fuse::DBI which allows you to mount relational database
as a file-system. Imagine editing templates from your CMS with vi. Joy,
right?
Back to serious notes, having ability to write filesystems in user-space
is something that micro kernels (like HURD or plan9) had for a long time
and it's extremely useful if file-system semantic is mappable to problem
at hand.
That would also help reduce kernel bloat because you could write
something like umsdos in user-space where it belongs in first place.
