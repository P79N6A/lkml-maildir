It is the old problem with mV in battery_level_mV.  How do you know for sure
what is the designator, and what is the unit (or in this case, color)?  You
could take the last _[^_]+, but what if there is no unit/color? etc.
There is a BIIIIG thread about it (or more than one, actually) in the
archives, and I don't recall a consensus being reached.
