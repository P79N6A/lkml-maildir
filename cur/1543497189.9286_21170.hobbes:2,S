Gerard, you are pretty clearly not aware of all that Ted has done for
the community.   Ted's been around since before Linux was a twinkle
in Linus' eye, has done a great deal of good work for the community,
and continues to do so.  He certainly speaks for me, and given a bunch
of recent discussions at Linux Expo, that feeling is pretty widely held.
Ted is a very pleasant and reasonable guy, and his comments on this
topic were, as usual, accurate and right on target.  If anyone speaks
for the community, Ted does.  I wish that both I and you were held in
as high esteem as he is.
But isn't this a little off topic for the kernel list?
