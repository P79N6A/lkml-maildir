I could test and actually saw memory leaking when cycling the w83781d
driver at a sustained rate (5/s).

I ended up implementing 1*. That's cleaner and there's actually almost
no extra code.
Mark, can you confirm that I'm doing the correct thing? I'll do
something similar in our CVS repository (for now, the asb100 and w83781d
drivers had not their memory allocation scheme reworked there).
Greg, please apply if it looks good to you. Sorry for introducing the
leak in the first place...
Thanks.
