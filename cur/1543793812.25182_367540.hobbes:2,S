Actually that will screw over performance even further by forcing us to
send out loads of little RPC requests to write 4k pages instead of
allowing us to gather those writes into 32k (or larger) chunks.
Anyhow, does the following patch help?

 Ensure that we call clear_page_dirty() for pages that have been written
 via writepage().
