drivers/block/loop.c used by loopback filesystem code uses function
deactivate_page that was defined in mm/swap.c in kernel 2.4.13
deactivate_page seems to have been suppressed at kernel level 2.4.14
from
mm/swap.c
this results in missing entry point complaints when trying to load
module loop.o
at kernel level 2.4.14
I am not knowledgeable about these modules and am not sure if or how
loop.c and/or swap.c should be fixed
I could not find any other place to report theses findings either.
hoping that you can forward this to the proper person.
