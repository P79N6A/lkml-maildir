I don't think the symbols are an issue for the Freebob project.
Atleast, not right now. The code doesn't use the symbols. Most of the
driver is intended to be in userspace anyways.
Moreover, if you are going to break in the interface, you might as
well do it before the driver
is written rather than after.
Just my 2c.
