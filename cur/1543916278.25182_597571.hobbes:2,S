fs/nfs/super.c:
		case Opt_sharecache:
			mnt->flags &= ~NFS_MOUNT_UNSHARED;
			break;
		case Opt_nosharecache:
			mnt->flags |= NFS_MOUNT_UNSHARED;
			mnt->options &= ~NFS_OPTION_FSCACHE;
			break;
		case Opt_fscache:
			/* sharing is mandatory with fscache */
			mnt->options |= NFS_OPTION_FSCACHE;
			mnt->flags &= ~NFS_MOUNT_UNSHARED;
			break;
		case Opt_nofscache:
			mnt->options &= ~NFS_OPTION_FSCACHE;
			break;
