I looked, but couldn't see any definition for RAS in your doc.
Could you add one?
The fs/Kconfig hunk might be a nice place to define it, since
naive users might see that text when configuring kernels.
http://www.kernelnewbies.org/glossary/#R
 does define it,
but it's so far down on
http://www.google.com/search?q=define
%3Aras
that most people configuring a kernel might not be familiar with that sense.
