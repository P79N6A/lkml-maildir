Please be careful with this in drivers.  Coherent memory can be phenomenally 
expensive to obtain on some hardware.  Sometimes it has to be implemented by 
turning off caching  and globally flushing the tlb.  Thus it really makes 
sense most of the time for drivers to allocate all the coherent memory they 
need initially and not have it go through the usual memory allocate/free cycle 
except under extreme conditions.  That's sort really what both pci_pool and 
mempool aim for.
