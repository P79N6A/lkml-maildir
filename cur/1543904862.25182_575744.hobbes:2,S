Subject: [PATCH] TSDEV - Don't flood dmesg with removal warnings
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

tsdev.c warns about scheduled removal each time tsdev_open is called - 
So even for a default boot I get to see the warning 3 times -
[  340.537078] tsdev (compaq touchscreen emulation) is scheduled for 
removal.
[  340.537081] See Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt for details.
[  340.550314] tsdev (compaq touchscreen emulation) is scheduled for 
removal.
[  340.550318] See Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt for details.
[  340.565065] tsdev (compaq touchscreen emulation) is scheduled for 
removal.
[  340.565068] See Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt for details.
Move the warning to tsdev_init() from tsdev_open so we don't end up 
printing a large string in dmesg everytime tsdev_open is called.
