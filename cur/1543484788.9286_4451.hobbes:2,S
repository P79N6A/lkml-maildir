That would have been my question (why using the tq for ptys...).

Removed the tty->termios patch and applied this one (that it started
from a fresh kernel tree + this patch): no more warnings, no more
oopses. Looks like the theory's good :-)
Ptys are fixed for me, but I'll do more testing to be sure.
Linus, if you need a testbed to test asynchronous hangups on ptys
(reverting to the old tty_hangup() rather than the synchronous
tty_vhangup() temporarily), I can crash my box a few more times :-)
Phil.
