They don't. Git doesn't convert, with the exception of two mail-related tools, 
which is the reason the commit being discussed ended up as UTF-8
in GIT. The mail containing the patch was in ISO-8859-1. All other git tools 
just store whatever byte sequence they are fed, be ut ISO-latin, utf-8 or 
something (to westeners) more exotic.
