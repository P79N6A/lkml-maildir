yeah, i wanted to suggest this originally, but got distracted by the x86 
quirk that 'IRQ#0' is often the i8253 timer interrupt.
is there any architecture where irq 0 is a legitimate setting that could 
occur in drivers, and which would make NO_IRQ define of 0 non-practical?  
If not (which i think is the case) then we should indeed standardize on 
0. (in one way or another) It's not like any real driver will ever have 
IRQ#0 even on a PC: the timer IRQ is 'known' to be routed to 0, and we 
do a platform-specific setup_irq() on it. Not a good reason to abstract 
the notion of 'no irq' away into a define.
in fact we dont even have to do the irq.valid thing, !dev->irq is 
obviously readable.
