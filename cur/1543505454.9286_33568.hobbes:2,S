Well, I figured out why I couldnt get it to compile.  I forgot to
change the READ_DATA_PORT to the right number that is gotten from
isapnp.conf.  It will register correctly now, but it still doesnt get
updated in /proc/sys/net/conf/, which I still need to use the same ip
as my ppp interface.  Im not sure why.
