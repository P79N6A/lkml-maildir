Oops, web content a little stale...
Try checking out the sf.net acpi project page - sf.net/projects/acpi. You
can d/l releases there and each release has a changelog.
As to development status:
Everything is code complete (more or less) EXCEPT:
- S3/S4 support
- userspace library
- using ACPI for device PnP and resource determination
If you're interested with following ACPI progress, I'd recommend subscribing
to the acpi-devel mailing list.
