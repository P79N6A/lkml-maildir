Yes, syncookies, while presenting some tradeoffs, are a necessary tool
to have.
The problem is that any reasonably recent PC can generate enough
forged SYN packets to overwhelm reasonable SYN queues on a much more
powerful server.
Imagine a server with a few hundres Apache virtual hosts.  One website
pisses off the wrong person and it impacts service for everyone.
While syncookies isn't always enough, enabling it often helps
make the server more resiliant during attacks.  And for web service, most
of the connections are short-lived connections for small pieces of data -
so I'm not really convinced that window scaling and selective ACK are all
that important.
