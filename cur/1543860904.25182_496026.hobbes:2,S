I think it's mostly high end use and high end users tend to understand
more. But we're going to see more really large filesystems in "normal"

Currently, large file support is already necessary to handle dvd and
video. It's also useful for images for virtualization. So the failing stat()
calls should already be a thing of the past with modern distributions.
