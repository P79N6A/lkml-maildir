And I wasn't assuming that. There are several bootloaders for intel alone,
eg syslinux and grub, to name a couple. sparc has silo, alpha has
something else....whatever.

I've been a Linux user/administrator for 3 years now. Before that I worked
on and administered UNIX machines for about 10 years, including SunOS,
HP/UX, and AIX. If you think that Linux is the only operating system to
undergo vast changes like that you're wrong: look at the SunOS to Solaris
switch....Basically the same operating system, no? However, many things
were different....OK its off topic but im sure you get the idea.

see, thats where you and i disagree...I wouldn't call you an end user
based upon that fact. End users (IMO) are those people who sit back and
buy a PC and expect it to Just Work(tm). Servers, embedded devices, et al 
(read: high-end applications) do not equate to end-user applications,
IMNSHO. Besides, *most* (and I say most because I've seen a sharp decline
in the mentality of Linux users as of late) people who are going to manage
a high-scale server are going to know what the hell they are doing in the
first place, so I highly doubt that the end-user argument holds merit
against this.
Linux, whether you like it or not, is a full-scale UNIX. It takes a good
(read: talented) system administrator to manage any UNIX properly...A good
sysadmin reads documentation....Seems clear enough to me. But, then again,
this is coming from an experienced sysadmin so my opinion *must* be
biased.
Talk to you later,
