Well, FWIW, neither does some "decision" from the kernel authors; it
hinges on what is and what is not a derived work of the kernel, and
the only parties whose opinion matters here (the courts in the various
jurisdictions) haven't ruled on that yet, and won't until such time as
a copyright holder in the kernel sues someone for copyright
infringement.
