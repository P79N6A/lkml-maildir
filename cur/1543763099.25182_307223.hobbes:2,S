as i mentioned it before, taking a lock is not a big issue at all. Since 
you have to touch the lock data structure anyway (and all of it fits 
into a single cacheline), it doesnt really matter whether it's atomic 
flag setting/clearing, or raw spinlock based.
later on, once things are stable and well-understood, we can still 
attempt to micro-optimize it.
