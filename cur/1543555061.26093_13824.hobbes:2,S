Did you look at kiobufs ? I think they may just have the right
functionality. I always wanted bootimg to be able to memory-map things
to reduce memory pressure, and it seems now all the ingredients are in
place. Your file-based approach could probably use brw_kiovec.

Hmm, if you succeed in selling the format as an integral part of your
network boot protocol, this may even work ;-)

Oh, it does - but the policy is implemented in user space. And, of
course, it's rather simple. But I'm a little confused with your
UBE. It only seems to copy the e820 information, so you still seem
to rely on e.g. the SMP tables the BIOS stores in memory. Also, I
don't quite see where you're using the saved information. What am
I missing ?
However, parameter passing like UBE may solve the following two
potential problems:
 - kernel 1 copies tables marked by "magic" numbers in memory,
   then boots kernel 2, which trips over the copy
 - kernel 1 doesn't know about a table and damages it, then boots
   kernel 2, which recognizes the table, and trips over it
But I think we don't need to copy or even convert the entire tables for
this. After all, any OS that boots on i386 already knows how to parse
the BIOS-provided tables, so I think it's better to directly re-use
this code than to invent a new format. A few flags or maybe a short
list should be sufficient for the problems I've described above.

Yep, I fully agree.

This is exactly what bootimg does :)

Yes, for now I cheat and depend on gcc to generate code that just
happens to be PIC.
