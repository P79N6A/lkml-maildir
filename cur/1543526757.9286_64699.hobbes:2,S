Yeah, but you DO need it to have the same in your fstab...

It's not that important to me how are the things called exactly. All my
posts on the subject are kinda speculations and I'm with both old and new
namespaces since long ago :))  The principal concern is the stability - it'd
be helluva bad if the things are changed for a third time... I did change a
lotta apps to stick with new namespace (no compatibility entries, ANY of
them is evil) and it'd be not all that good to restart the process...
BTW, why /dev/disCs, not /dev/disKs ? :))
