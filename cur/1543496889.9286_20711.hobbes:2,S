Hi,
I didn't know were else to send this.  The Linux docs say if I'm total
clueless, send it here. :)
I found a minor bug in lib/string.c, in the strncpy() function.  These
two lines need to be added after the first while loop.
while(count--)
	*dest++ = '\0';
ANSI says strncpy() needs to have the destination string null padded 
to 'count' bytes if the source string has ended.
