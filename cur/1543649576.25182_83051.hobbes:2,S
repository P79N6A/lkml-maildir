Please read the LSM documentation for more information about this.  It
can be found in the kernel at:
	Documentation/DocBook/lsm.*
and there are a number of USENIX and OLS papers about different aspects
of the project at:
	lsm.immunix.org
In the beginning of the LSM project, both the DProbes and LTT groups
came asking that we use their patches to implement LSM.  It was
quickly determined that the types of "hooks" these projects offered was
not what the LSM group needed (or wanted).  So the current
implementation was developed.
Hope this helps.  If you have any further questions, please feel free to
ask (after reading that documentation :)
thanks,
