	Actually, wouldn't it be better to have people writting 2.5.X
driver and having your toolkit enabling them for 2.4.X and 2.2.X ?
	Also, have you looked at the Pcmcia package, David Hinds has a
pretty complete compatibility toolkit going back to 1.2.X, and used by
many Pcmcia drivers (it's actually pretty amazing to see all those
Pcmcia drivers working regardless). Maybe you could propose David a
merge of the two (you get some more code and some more userbase).
	Yes, of course, NIH...
	Have fun...
	Jean
