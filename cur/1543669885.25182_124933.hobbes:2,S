Toshiba Satellite 4300 laptop with the following display adapter:
S3 Inc. 86C270-294 Savage/IX-MV (rev 11) 
2.4.20 kernel works well with vga=0x305 and uses the entire LCD panel.
2.5.67 kernel with vga=0x305 sets a graphic mode that only uses the
inner 640x480 set of pixels and the display is just a jumbled mess.  
I did try the latest fb patch and the problem remains.  Also found a
note that said to try "video=vesa:ywrap,pmipal,mtrr" and this didn't
work either.
Regards,
Sean
