The discard in MAP_SHARED case isn't explicit.  It's due to CPU cache
incoherency, so the data (or just some of the data) is lost simply by
not syncing properly between userspace and the page cache.
It wouldn't be apparent on fully-coherent architectures like x86.
That was when I last looked at the code (during the 2.5 time frame).
I didn't test it, only examined the code, but quite thoroughly.
