No, it's called, "paraphrasing," and it's quite normal in a
conversation.  You say something, I tell you what I think you said, you
refine your language, and the process continues until we're happy that a
semantic consensus has been reached.  In that spirit, should I now
understand that what you meant is that *you* *think* that kernel modules
must be released under GPL.  Should I accept that you didn't mean that
numerous lawyers had told you that this was factually so?
Of course, this begs the question of why there would be a
MODULE_LICENSE("proprietary").  You may hold beliefs as understood
above, but it seems guaranteed that the opinions of those who count are
divided.
