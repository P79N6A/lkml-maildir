In my previous post i mentioned something like that as to why your vm didn't 
perform as well.  The thing isn't that you use all of my available memory 
(ram + swap), it's that you allocate it all, leaving nothing for the program 
later on.  I think anything that uses almost a gig of ram outside of 
databases is going to be a corner case, but perhaps a better way to figure 
out how much memory should be allocated is needed here.   Andrea's vm seems 
to do a good job at that.  if only he could figure out a better way to swap 
out pages correctly the first time (as some people say his made more mistakes 
than yours) then i cant really find anything bad about it.  And i'm trying 
to.  
Also as others pointed out.   After the process was done. You had quite a lot 
more swap still allocated.  Why exacty?
