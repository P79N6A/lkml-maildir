I see the problem; inode_lock isn't currently an exported symbol, and
I generally don't compile ext4 as a module, so I didn't notice the
problem.  The patch in question is a debugging patch that is never
meant for mainline or a for-stable series, so the simplest thing to do
for now is just to revert the patch.  I'll look into a module-friendly
way of accomplishing the same goal.
