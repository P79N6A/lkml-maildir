The CRTCInfoBlock structure passed for Function 0x4f02 does not include
xres and yres so the horizontal and vertical active lengths cannot be
modified arbitrarily, an appropriate mode ID must still be chosen. I
cannot set 880x244, for example, if it's not in the table. It's the
horizontal timings, the vertical timings and the pixelclock that can be
adjusted.
