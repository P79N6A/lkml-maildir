   OK, new version.
Well, actually I disagree with this.
I envisioned moving the compat stuff right next to the "normal"
implementation.
A problem currently, is that when people change VFS stuff up one has
to pay attention to update all the compat syscall layers as well.
This often simply does not happen because the compat version is
"somewhere else" is some other file.
Now if we put the stuff next to the non-compat stuff, it likely won't
get missed.
