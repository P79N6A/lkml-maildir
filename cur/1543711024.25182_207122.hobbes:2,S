That is not a valid reason.  The programs should be fixed.

I can't see why.  Ticks are used internally for process accounting (e.g. 
utime, stime, cutime and cstime) and if HZ was changing dynamically 
you'd have to visit every task and modify these values to be consistent 
with the changed value of HZ.  Even if HZ was allowed to change 
dynamically the values reported to user space should be in units 
appropriate to the MAXIMUM possible value of HZ so that precision is not 
lost.
