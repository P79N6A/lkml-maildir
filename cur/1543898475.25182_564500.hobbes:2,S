We now have two sets of flags - 
1) the above three with which I think no one has any issues with, and
2) the ones below, for which we need some discussions before finalizing
on them.
I will prefer fallocate going in mainline with the above three modes, and
rest of the modes can be debated upon and discussed parallely. And, each
new mode/flag can be pushed as a separate patch. This will not hold
fallocate feature indefinitely...
Please confirm if you find this approach ok. Otherwise, please object.
Thanks!
