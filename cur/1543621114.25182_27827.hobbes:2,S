However, if you're doing that, then you incur the cost of copying every incoming
packet and sending it up to userspace.  For a busy server, this could be
unacceptable.
Also, how are you timing the incoming packets?  In kernel space we can get
accuracy of a few tens of nanoseconds for timing the interrupts--how do you
approach this in userspace when your userspace process can be scheduled out?  
Even if we timestamp the packets with microsecond accuracy, we are still a few
orders of magnitude short of the accuracy attainable in the kernel, with
correspondingly less entropy that can be extracted.
