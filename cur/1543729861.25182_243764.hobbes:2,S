Subject: x86: NMI vs. MCE handling

Currently, care is being taken to deal with the potential of an NMI
being signalled at the very moment when the debug fault is correcting
the stack for the sysenter path, or when in at the stack pointer load in
the sysenter path itself. The same care, however, is not taken in the
MCE code path, and since I'd consider this equally important (especially
when the event is correctable) I wonder whether this is an oversight or
I'm misunderstanding something.
Thanks for a clarification,
Jan
