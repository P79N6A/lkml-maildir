Yet, it does seem to kill gdm. xdm and kdm seem to work fine.
Ok, I see the problem. I've fixed it, booted and tried gdm, and it works 
fine. The SA_ONESHOT was checked in the wrong place, the handler is set 
in the frame_setup routines, so I have to check and set the handler due 
to the SA_ONESHOT flag after this. The patch is attached.
