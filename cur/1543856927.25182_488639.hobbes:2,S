Subject: 2.6.19-rc6-mm2: Network device naming starts at 1 instead of 0

Quick note: I loaded up 2.6.19-rc6-mm2 on a platform here and noticed that the onboard
e1000 NIC was enumerated to eth1 instead of eth0. on 2.6.18.5 and any other kernel I
used before, it was properly named eth0 after startup. eth0 itself is completely missing
(-ENODEV).
I'll try to see if I can point out the culprit, but perhaps this rings a bell to anyone.
Cheers,
Auke
