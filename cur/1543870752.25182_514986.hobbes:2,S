Well that's all very dull - everything's just sitting there asleep.
If it was just X then I'd suspect the psmouse changes (are you PS2 or USB?)
Or I'd suspect that the entire interrupt system has gone bust, but you're
still able to do sysrq.
How are you doing sysrq, btw?   Serial console?  alt-F7 into a vgaconsole?
Are you able to log in from another machine via ssh?
Are you able to log into it via ssh before it hangs and run things like
`top' and `watch -n1 cat /proc/interrupts', see what they do when it hangs?
Is the CPU idle when it hangs, or is it busy?  If busy, what does sysrq-P
say?
