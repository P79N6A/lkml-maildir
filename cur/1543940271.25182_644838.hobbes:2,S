I think there's only one fundamental disagreement; and that is:
do we think that things are now totally fixed and no new major issues
will arrive after the "fix yet another mmconfig thing" patches are merged.
If the answer is no, then imho my patch is the right approach; it will limit the damage and doesn't make
the people suffer who don't need extended config space.
If the answer is yet, then my patch is not needed.
This is a judgment call; I'm skeptical, others are more optimistic that after 2 years of messing around
they have finally found the last golden fix.
