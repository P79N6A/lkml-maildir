Thanks. I'll rewrite this way.

This module provides new feature.
We can write debugging messages to PC-9800's NVRAM.
I don't know PC's CMOS can be used for this purpose, or not.
But, if other subarchtecture has usable space in NVRAM,
I assume scenario as follows.
rewrite some codes in pc9800_debug.c and put them mach-xxx directory,
then split out codes for PC-9800 and move them into mach-pc9800 direcory.

IORESOURCE98_SPARSE flag means odd or even only addressing.
We modify check_region(), request_region() and release_region().
If length parameter has negative value, addressing is sparse.
For example,
 request_region(0x100, -5, "xxx"); gets 0x100, 0x102 and 0x104.
