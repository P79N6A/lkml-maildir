I have found that in teh case of blocks that wont reallocate with reads,
a sufficiently large number of reads and writes will fix them
eventually, by reallocating. The bahaviour doesnt seem entirely
predicatable (but then failure modes often arent), but given time it is
possible to do.

This really isnt going to work with swap partitions and suchlike. If you
cant get rid of a bad sector with reads and writes on badblocks, smart
tests and the manufacturers low level format then it is defective and
you should discard it or return it under warranty. The bad blcoks list
is really not needed. If you really want to do it, use dm to remap the
raw device without bad blocks, then you can still use it on filesystems
without badblocks support (eg swap, raid etc). The device mapping stuff
should have no trouble with this.

use the read test on badblocks to find the sector, then use the write
tests tooverwrite it until the badblock is fixed, then fsck your
partition. If you get errors then the block was metadata. Otherwise
md5sum your files and check against the backups. That will tell you the
file... For ext2 I believe there are some tools, for other file systems
it might be more difficult.
