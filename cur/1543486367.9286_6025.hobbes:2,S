I think this is very desirable.  It is also desirable to be able to
disable some CPUs.  I have one example where this kind of flexibility
is desirable.
We ran a 4-CPU SGI machine a while back.  It was used by students and
obviously they did lots of weird things with it.  Once in a while, a
student would write a program that essentially forked in a loop where
the parent process exited.  This kind of process is _hard_ to kill
since neither is it visible using 'ps', nor is the PID constant.  In
IRIX, it is easy to solve this problem by disabling 3 CPUs, and
scheduling your shell as a real-time process.  Alternatively, you can
allocate one CPU to the OS, one for your shell, and disable the other
processes.  None of this is possible in Linux.  In Linux, on a 4-way
SMP system, you're stuck.
