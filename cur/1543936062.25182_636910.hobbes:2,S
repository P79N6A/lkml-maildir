Well, I think we'd still have the same page size, in the sense that we'd
have a struct page for every hardware page and we'd still have hardware
page-sized pages in the page cache. We'd just change how we allocated
them. Right now we've got a stack that looks like:
 buddy / page allocator
 SL*B allocator
 kmalloc
And we'd change that to:
 buddy allocator
 SL*B allocator
 page allocator / kmalloc
So get_free_page() would still hand you back a hardware page, it would
just do it through SL*B.

Not sure what you're referring to here.

Well I wasn't thinking of doing this for any performance reasons. But
there certainly could be some.
