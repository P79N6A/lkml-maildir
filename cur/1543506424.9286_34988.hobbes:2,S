Hello, I write this to hear if anybody else is experiencing this too ...
Very often (let's say 50% of the times) when I compile something big
(e.g. a big source RPM as in the following log) it fails with an error
like the following :
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I../.. -I. -I. 					
-I../../intl -I../../intl		-I./../../panel				
        -I../../panel 	-DGNOMELOCALEDIR=\""/usr/share/locale"\"

-Wno-unused  -c diskusage.c
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I../.. -I. -I. 					
-I../../intl -I../../intl		-I./../../panel				
        -I../../panel 	-DGNOMELOCALEDIR=\""/usr/share/locale"\"		
-I/usr/include -I/usr/include -DNEED_GNOMESUPPORT_H
-I/usr/lib/gnome-libs/include -I/usr/lib/glib/include
-I/usr/X11R6/include -I/usr/include -DGLIBTOP_INODEDB -DHAVE_LIBGTOP_SMP

-I/usr/lib/gnome-libs/include -I/usr/lib/glib/include
-I/usr/X11R6/include -I/usr/lib/glib/include  -I/usr/X11R6/include
-I/usr/lib/glib/include  -O2 -m486 -fno-strength-reduce -Wall
-Wno-unused  -c diskusage_read.c
In file included from ../../panel/applet-widget.h:14,
                 from diskusage.h:4,
                 from diskusage_read.c:7:
../../panel/gnome-panel.h:7: directory `/usr/include/orb/orbit.h'
specified in #include
make[3]: *** [diskusage_read.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory
`/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/gnome-core-1.0.9/applets/diskusage'

make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/gnome-core-1.0.9'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2
It seems to me, from the error messages, that the file
'/usr/include/orb/orbit.h' is at this stage seen as a directory.
Note that after the failure said file looks really good and, in fact,
retrying
the compilation usually succeeds, so the problem doesn't seem to be at
file-
system level (on the disk I mean...) 
My computer is a pentium 133mhz with 64Mb ram
The compiler is gcc version 2.7.2.3 and the distribution a RedHat 5.2
I'm now using linux-2.2.11, but the same happened also with 2.2.9 at
least.
I'll be glad to provide other information if needed.
Thanks in advance
	Lorenzo
