Hi all,
I am using kernel 2.6.14.6-grsec (x86_64 on AMD Sempron 64) with QoS (HTB)
Occasionally, when pppd drops a connection I see this in syslog :
Mar 25 13:40:17 myserver pppd[1300]: No response to 3 echo-requests
Mar 25 13:40:17 myserver pppd[1300]: Serial link appears to be disconnected.
Mar 25 13:40:17 myserver pppd[1300]: Connect time 1250.6 minutes.
Mar 25 13:40:17 myserver pppd[1300]: Sent 971616622 bytes, received 
1884313787 bytes.
Mar 25 13:40:20 myserver pppd[1300]: Connection terminated.
Mar 25 13:40:30 myserver kernel: unregister_netdevice: waiting for ppp0 
to become free. Usage count = 358
Then only force reboot of the machine solves the problem.
I found very similar problem with same symptoms :

Do you have any ideas how I can debug why dev->refcnt did not reach zero?
regards,
Martin
