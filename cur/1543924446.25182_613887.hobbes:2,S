A few unrelated observations about Barcelona support...

This is probably wrong.  The TSC is on the northbridge on Barcelona chips, so 
every core on the die should be in sync.  Hypothetically you could have 
different speed northbridges in different sockets, but we've never tried very 
hard to support that case anyway.  We should probably be marking the TSC as 
stable on Barcelona chips.

We should probably also implement an SSE5 function to take advantage of the 
128-bit SSE operations supported on newer processors.

Hmmm... perhaps we're not handling the new mmconfig stuff correctly?  Or maybe 
the BIOS isn't.

This code probably needs an update for Barcelona.

An update here for SSE5 might be in order as well.
