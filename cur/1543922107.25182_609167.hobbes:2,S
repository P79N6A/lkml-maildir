Subject: Linux Security *Module* Framework (Was: LSM conversion to static      interface

I currently have an LSM that only handles permissions for socket_bind
and socket_listen, I load it and then "capability" as secondary on
boot - but now I can't because the LSM framework is now just the LS
framework.
Why can't this "static LSM" change be a Kconfig option?
(I don't want to have to maintain my own reverted copy of security/,
or compile this into the kernel because then I can't ever modify and
reload it without rebooting.)
