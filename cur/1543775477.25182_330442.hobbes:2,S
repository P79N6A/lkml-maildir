That shouldn't happen with write() traffic due to the dirty memory
balancing logic.
It'll happen with MAP_SHARED.  Totally disallowing MAP_SHARED sounds a bit
drastic, but of course nfs/v9fs could be taught to do that.

eh?  How can the fuse client and the fuse server both get access to the
same file in this manner?  I don't see how you could set that up with NFS,
for example.

I think nfs can do this, as long as the modification was done through the
server.  I'd expect v9fs would be the same.

Others (many) would disagree.
Sorry, but I'm not buying it.  I still don't see a solid reason why all
this could not be done with nfs/v9fs, some kernel tweaks and the rest in
userspace.  It would take some effort, but that effort would end up
strengthening existing kernel capabilities rather than adding brand new
things, which is good.
