Subject: NTFS disk usage on Linux 2.6

Has anyone else noticed that the reported disk space usage on
NTFS is completely unreliable on Linux 2.6?  Just issued the
command "du -sh" on my main Windows XP partition, and on 2.6.1,
the reported disk usage is bigger than the partition size.
Here's the output from "du -sh *" in Windows' root directory
under Linux 2.6.1:
  0       AUTOEXEC.BAT
  0       CONFIG.SYS
  43M     Documents and Settings
  0       IO.SYS
  0       MSDOS.SYS
  48K     NTDETECT.COM
  366M    Program Files
  0       RECYCLER
  20K     System Volume Information
  12G     WINDOWS
  0       boot.ini
  232K    ntldr
  768M    pagefile.sys
Same command on 2.4.24:
  0       AUTOEXEC.BAT
  0       CONFIG.SYS
  41M     Documents and Settings
  0       IO.SYS
  0       MSDOS.SYS
  48K     NTDETECT.COM
  366M    Program Files
  2.0K    RECYCLER
  21K     System Volume Information
  1.4G    WINDOWS
  1.0K    boot.ini
  230K    ntldr
  770M    pagefile.sys
(The contents of the filesystem was, of course, identical in both
cases -- I did not run Windows in between these tests.)
Compare the disk space used by the WINDOWS directory in the
two listings.  On 2.4.24, it correctly reports 1.4G, while
2.6.1 reports 12G, which is 2G more than the total space on
the filesystem.
I also compared this to the listings produced by "ls -lR"
(summing the numbers on the "total ..." lines).  The result
was the same as with du -sh.
