Ok, I see tow things here.
1. do you really want to try and propogate things like this from one to 
the other, or would it be good enough to flag the issue and let the 
software selecting the modes implement this contraint?
2. how can you standardize the requirements?
at the very least you have
for this mode all children must be off
for this mode all children must be in a mode that includes a 'suspended' 
flag (this could be made implicit by saying that you must suspend children 
before parents) and then just flagging the 'suspended, but not off' modes)
what requirements are needed? (I'm sure that there are others, but 
hopefully it's possible to avoid requirements like 'the clock speed for 
device A must be >X to allow device B to operate in mode Y')
