That might be interesting to someone:
My VIA EPIA based machine  was working well until some minutes ago. I
accidently removed the power supply and the machine rebooted. From
then on I didn't have network anymore. The ethernet card (VIA Rhine
II) (static, not dhcp) was not working and "Oversized ...."  messages
were printed on the console.
I've rebooted twice and the network didn't still come up. Pinging a
machine on my LAN and pinging the box back resulted in > 98% of the
packets lost.
So I stopped the machine, let it rest for a minute or so and booted
again. That solved the problem.
So if you see the same message as Udo, try to let your box rest.
