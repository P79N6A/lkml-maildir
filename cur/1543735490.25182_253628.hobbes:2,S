No, we solve it with the /etc/dev.d system.  How is that not a solution?

That's exactly what /etc/dev.d is there for.

No it isn't.  A modprobe error means that the module couldn't load for
some reason.  It doesn't mean that a device was not found, or that an
error happened when probing the device.  And if you object otherwise,
think about what happens if you have more than 1 device controlled by a
module, how would you report an error that way?  :)

No it doesn't at all.  userspace doesn't know that I really have 6
usb-storage devices plugged into my system, and that it needs to "wait"
after I run 'modprobe usb-storage'
However my system _does_ know that if it sees a specific type of
usb-storage device it should name it a specific unique name no matter
where it is plugged into the system, and that it needs to mount that
device at a specific mount point.  That's what userspace is supposed to
know about, and do.

Then just exit, and resume your "system startup" from the /etc/dev.d
notifier.  That works properly.

Please explain how that will work for a device on a bus that is probed
quite slowly (like USB) when we do not know ahead of time how many
devices there are, and what type of driver will bind to them (think
scsi-generic or scsi-tape or scsi-disk...)

I agree polling is not the proper way.  That's why /etc/dev.d exists.

What information is in drivers that is not known by userspace?
userspace knows what kind of devices that are supported by all drivers,
and so userspace loads the proper driver when it is told by the kernel a
specific device has shown up.  That works just fine and keeps users from
having to figure out what driver is needed for their new device.
