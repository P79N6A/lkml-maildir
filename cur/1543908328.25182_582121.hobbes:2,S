Sure.  We currently have 3 fields for that: data, extra1, and extra2.
You need to cast them to get an integer values but their definition
especially extra1 and extra2 are left up to the caller.
In that code we could just do a test on valp (i.e. data in struct
ctl_table).
I just wanted something stupid and simple, so the -mm tree would not
be full of broken sysctls.
At least to my eyes the code doesn't look much worse.  But if you
want to do something better feel free.
