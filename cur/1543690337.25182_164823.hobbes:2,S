It's likely that if your system supports ACPI, the APM implementation will 
not work, especially if you boot with ACPI enabled.

What exactly does it do on wakeup? 
Would you please try the patch at: 
http://developer.osdl.org/~mochel/patches/test5-pm1/test5-pm2.diff.bz2
against 2.6.0-test5 and report whether or not it works? 
Also, please try removing all modules before suspending and reinserting 
them after resuming. 
Do you have any of the following enabled: 
SMP?
Preempt?
APIC?

That should be:
	echo "3" > /proc/acpi/sleep
But, please use the sysfs interface. 
Thanks,
