So how does this say the value of the fdsets are undefined after a
timeout? It says specifically that upon success it returns the number of
descriptors in the sets, zero if the timeout expires. That is a success
condition upon which select() sets the fdsets to contain the descriptors
upon which something interesting happened. In the case of a timeout with
no descriptor having anything interesting, the sets would, logically, be
cleared.
The man page does state that the value of "timeout" is effectively
undefined upon return and that "timeout" and the fdsets are undefined
after an error, however.
Of course, not looking at the sets upon a zero return is a fairly obvious
optimization as there is little point in doing so.
