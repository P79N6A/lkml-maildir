Can't we move the shared files into a new shared arch/ subdirectory
(ia32_64 or whatever), and have them included from both places?
At least then it's obvious they're shared, and it's a migration
strategy to the shared arch that you want.
On the downside, it's more ../../.. type stuff. On the upside,
they're more cleanly separated and it's apparent what's going on.
Seems nicer to me than drivers/ and kernel/ for stuff that's
really arch specific, but shared between two arches.
