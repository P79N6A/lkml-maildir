One thing that might be useful to do is replace all the
#ifdef FOO
#endif
in the kernel with
if (C_FOO) {
}
(where C_FOO is 1 or 0). That way at least everything would be compiled
always and it would discover some incompatibilities. But since we compile
with -O2 or better, the code block should vanish if the test evaluates
to a zero at compile time.
