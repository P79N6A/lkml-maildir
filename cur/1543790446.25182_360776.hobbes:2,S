This is on a filesystem that has been mounted with the -ro flag? That
would be a client bug.
Hmm... The client code does look a bit dodgy there (particularly NFSv4).
I'll see if I can come up with a patch.

How would knfsd or mountd know? There is no way for the client to
communicate to the server that it is mounting for read-write.
