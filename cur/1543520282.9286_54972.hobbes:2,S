Are ioctls broken for token ring?  The function I register in
dev->do_ioctl never seems to get called by ifconfig.
I'd like to be able to add the feature of changing my cards' MAC address
using ifconfig without resorting to adding a module parameter to do so at
insmod time.  This is for the TMS380 token ring driver.  Several cards can
be supported chipset-wise, but they can cannot be _used_ because I don't
have EEPROM-reading routines written specifically for them (yet), and
therefore they load and initialize with a zeroed MAC.  The only thing
needed to get them working is manually setting the MAC address to
something reasonable, usually by adding stuff to the driver to set it.  
I could just add a module parameter, but that gets tricky to handle when
your driver supports multiple cards (specifically, how to answer: which
card gets the passed-in parameters?).  If I could support it with
ifconfig, it would would be simple:  Just insmod, "ifconfig tr0 hw tr
xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx", and then "ifconfig tr0 x.x.x.x".  (Granted, you can't
change the MAC address once the adapter has been opened, but its fine just
after you insmod.)
I've read through the net-tools/ifconfig source, and it uses the
SIOCSIFHWADDR ioctl to set the hardware address.  I have that code all
implemented, its just that the ioctl function is never getting called.
Suggestions?  This is 2.3.28 (I should upgrade...) and CVS net-tools.

Thanks to Madge/Olicom for donated cards and info!  Cardbus and ISA
support is next.  Then hopefully Olicom's OC-3540 100/16/4 card (anybody
have an extra token ring switch? :)
