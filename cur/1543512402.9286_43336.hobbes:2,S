kmod keeps devices available here.

OK, either /dev/disk1 is everytime the same disk (in which case persistence
is mandatory) or it is not (there I agree with you). But in the second case
the name and major/minor things are totally useless, as you can't depend on
them as handles for anything. Then just use some other way to manage devices,
and forget /dev altogether then.
