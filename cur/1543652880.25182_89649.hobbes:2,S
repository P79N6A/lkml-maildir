I wasn't entirely expecting it to work out of the box. I was really
trying to get the VM structure traversal and access in line with
the general case, and then worry (later) about deeper issues like
that once they arise. kmap_atomic() etc. should be no-ops without
highmem, so otherwise it'd be safe (at least on the save path), aside
from perhaps suggesting that highmem should work when it wouldn't.
The restore path, OTOH...
I should take a look at suspend_asm.S to get an idea of what you're
talking about with respect to its expectations being violated by
the code snippet I posted.
At some point in the past, I wrote:

I'm not entirely sure either. Mostly I suspect that the deep arch
issues will be the tough ones, but things like this I can handle. =)
Thanks,
