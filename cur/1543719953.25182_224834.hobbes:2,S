And btw, I didn't say from the beginning.  I just want a comitment from
the lustre folks that they're merging it so we can work out the rough edges
together.  There's not much of a problem doing the merge spread over a few
kernel releases.

I think for mainline mostly the client, aka the llite directory would
be interesting, so a linux box can simply join the lustre cluster.  the
metadata server and even worse the object storage box mods would require
tons of work to get anywhere a mergeable shape and are less interesting
anyway.
