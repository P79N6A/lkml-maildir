The compilation output already shows that HZ wasn't set while compiling
panic.c (there's none of your "Just an info" messages).
Most likely you've forgotten to add a
  #include <linux/config.h>
to your modified param.h and therefore none of your custom CONFIG_*HZ is
defined when the compiler goes through param.h.
