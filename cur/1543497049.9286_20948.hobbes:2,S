You *really* don't want to run an ext2fs, ufs, xfs, etc filesystem at more
than 95% capacity, unless you're writing to it once and then mounting it
readonly.  Otherwise, it will be slow.  Very slow.  Think Windows 95 on
barbituates.
Anyway, this isn't a kernel issue.

To be honest, with modern hard drive sizes, the unit needs to be
changed from % to %^2 or 1/10'000ths of capacity, at least. One way
would be for mk*fs to allow two decimal places on the %'s, and that
has the advantage of remaining compatible with the existing format,
whilst another would be to allocate a new option along the lines of
the following:
 -u  Specify the number of millionth's of reserved blocks for the
     superuser. This value defaults to 50,000, or 5% of the total.
I chose -u because it is not only currently not listed on mke2fs's
manpage, but u is also the latinised version of the scientific symbol
for millionth, its name being micro.
Best wishes from Riley.
