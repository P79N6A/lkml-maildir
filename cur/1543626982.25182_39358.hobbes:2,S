I have implemented the second solution.  Multi linked objects get no
value for KBUILD_OBJECT.  I had to do this anyway, depending on which
order the objects were compiled, kbuild was registering different
values for KBUILD_OBJECT.  That was causing spurious rebuilds and the
command appeared to change.
