Subject: LTP test failures on current kernels (latest -git and -mm)

I'm seeing a lot of LTP failures in current kernels. Is this just LTP
being horribly broken? Or are mailine kernels broken?
I've never been keen on it's "expected failure" model, but this does
seem to be excessive. Get very similar failures from -mm and mainline.
