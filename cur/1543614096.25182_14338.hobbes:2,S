Strictly speaking, "Byte" is actually a prefix, too. A prefix of the
number "1" - however, a prefix with a context. "bit", "rad" and others
are not real units, they are more like "context descriptions" off the
number "1".
I think, the prefixes "...T,G,M,k,m,µ..." should be taken, as they were
for a long time: context specific.
IMAO, if there is any sane way of defining this, it is by giving a base
as index (like the log function). In case of bit, Byte etc. -as they
already define a context- the base is always 2. In case of SI Base
Units, the base is 10.
But that's only my 0.5 Nibble cents/bit (oh, I mean Euro cents/bit).

P.S.: What's about using mole?
