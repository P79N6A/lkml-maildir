We already have pci_request_regions() and currently PCI drivers should 
use that.
Auto-ioremap would be bad, though... you would wind up wasting address 
space for any case where MMIO areas are not 100% utilized (like network 
cards that require use of PIO due to hardware bugs, but still export an 
MMIO region for their NIC registers)
