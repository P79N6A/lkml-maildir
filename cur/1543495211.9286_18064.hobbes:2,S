If it has the MPDxxxx firmware revision, they are dreaming in another
dimension of reality..........  I tested a 6.4GB drive on an Ultra66 w/
the 80c ATA-66 cable and it could only do ATA-33.

This sounds like the i430HX/i440FX PIIX3 and UDMA.......that never worked.

It does not exist and I just stripped it from enclusion in possible patch
code.  There are no mainboards that currently or correctly handle ATA-66.
The only vender that has a known and tested product with Linux is Promise
with their "Ultra66".  Since one report came back with generic ATA-66
enabled on an ATA-33 limited host adapter, do not expect generic ATA-66
support from Linux until the rules on paper that I am writing code for are
properly implimented.

This report above is now decode as an EIDE 40c ribbon that is to long
attached to an adapter that, is reporting that bit 13 of word93 to be set
valid, or disk venders are force setting this bit.  Regardless, the
problem of misdetection and configuration will never be allowed in the
kernel.
