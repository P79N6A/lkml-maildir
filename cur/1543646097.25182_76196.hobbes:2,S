Andreas,
	I noticed a problem with the scsi_error.c update the I made to
	2.5.40. There is a typo in the the tur check on error handling.
	I tested the patch yesterday and it is recovering better on
	faults. 
	I do not know if it will fix your problem, but it might be worth
	a try.
	I will send it to you in bit I am in the process of
	rolling it and other patches that depend on it up.
