But they do have non -1 ids, the device name itself just doesn't end in a
number. In this event, the delimiter makes no sense.
These drivers are expecting that you will have <devicename><id>, and
application code is expecting the same. /dev follows this convention too,
I don't see this as being an unreasonable expectation.
If anything, serial8250 is broken and should rename itself to something
not ending in a number. It's not nice when one driver exhibits a corner
case and decides to change the semantics for everyone else.

Yes, we end up having /sys/devices/platform/serial8250 and serial8250.0.
Where serial8250.0 ends up as:
drwxr-xr-x    3 0        0               0 Jan  1 00:00 .
drwxr-xr-x   18 0        0               0 Jan  1 00:00 ..
lrwxrwxrwx    1 0        0               0 Jan  1 00:00 bus -> ../../../bus/platform
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0            4096 Jan  1 00:00 detach_state
lrwxrwxrwx    1 0        0               0 Jan  1 00:00 driver -> ../../../bus/platform/drivers/serial8250
drwxr-xr-x    2 0        0               0 Jan  1 00:00 power
That doesn't really bother me, having serial8250.0 is more sensible then
serial82500. For this type of corner case the delimiter makes sense, but
not in a blanket sense.

Anything that expects that it can open a /sys/devices/platform/<device><id>
path. I have a few applications like this, I have no reason to doubt that
others do too. I don't see any reason to go out of the way to break this
convention if the end of the device name is not a number.
