 I just compiled a 2.2.12-20 kernel on 4x PIII Zeon with 4 gig of ram
with 2 gig ram support. The kernel was built to use modular scsi
support. I created an initrd image but when the machine boots the
ramdisk never loads so I get a kernel panic failure. If I recompile the
kernel with 1 gig support the initrd ramdisk loads fine. Is this a known
problem with 2.2.12-20 and is it fixed in a newer kernel? Thanks
