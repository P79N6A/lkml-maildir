That all depends on one's definition of 16-bit protected mode. The "(286)" 
after mine meant I was talking about the definition in which descriptors 
have a 24-bit base (and 16-bit limit) field -- ie, real 286 and arguably, 
"real 16-bit protected mode".
Yes, I guess another valid definition is "code with a 16-bit address and 
operand size default" on a 386+ and sure, that's just flipping a bit away.
In the context of Linux I agree it's also a sensible definition, so, well, 
whatever. The point was that real mode could only access the first 1M, not 
the first 16... :-)
