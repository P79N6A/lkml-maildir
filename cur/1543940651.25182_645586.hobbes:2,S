Hello Haavard (and Michael),
First I want to mention that I did not found the time yet to test your
latest integration of these atmel_serial patches, and I only know that
your set of the end of December works fine. I do not know the changes
you made since posting that set and your latest patch-set.
But let me clear some things up:
The original patchset I posted, existed of a set of patches suitable
for the mainline kernel, plus an additional patch for Preempt-RT only.
So, the splitup  of the interrupt handler was also needed for
Preempt-RT, but it was not the only patch that was needed on
preempt-rt.
Now looking at this problem:

I expect the UART generating the problem is the DBGU port. The DBGU
shares its interrupt line with the timer interrupt with the IRQF_TIMER
flag set, and thus the DBGU interrupt handler is running in
IRQF_NODELAY context. Within this context it is forbidden to lock a
normal spinlock, because a normal spinlock is converted to a mutex on
Preempt-RT; a mutex can sleep which is forbidden in interrupt context.
So, to get around this problem, this lock spinlock has to be of the
raw_spinlock_t type. The raw_spinlock_t is the normal mainline-kernel
spinlock, and as such it is not converted to a mutex, and will
therefor never sleep.
Attached a patch that changes this spinlock type. I used it in my
patchset, but your updates of December last year do not need this
patch anymore, so apparantly you changed something that has a
regression on Preempt-RT...

This problem is not there in the December-set either. It works like a charm...
I believe I have to look at the latest set of patches, and try to find
any regressions. Do you have a location somewhere where I can download
the latest versions? Or do I need to dig through LKML to find the
latest... ;-)
Kind Regards,
Remy

On PREEMPT-RT we may not block on a normal spinlock in IRQ/IRQF_NODELAY-context.
This patch fixes this by making the lock a raw_spinlock_t for the
Atmel serial console.
This patch demands the following patches to be installed first:
* atmel_serial_cleanup.patch
* atmel_serial_irq_splitup.patch
