Negative. CIFS as of 2.6.24-rc7 still does not support Windows 98,
or at least, the mount command I tried was not the right one:
	mount -t cifs //WIN98/c /mnt -o guest,sec=none
(It is a test share with a null password open for anyone.) I am running
out of options..
	CIFS VFS: cifs_mount failed w/return code = -2
