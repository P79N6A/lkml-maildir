For desktop loads, maybe. But for things that are compute bound, the
cost of context switching I believe still gets worse as CPUs continue
to be able to execute more instructions per cycle, get clocked faster,
and get larger caches.

Well we might be able to work it out by looking at the tunables or
amount of kernel memory available, but I guess it is hard to just
pick a number.
I'll try running a few more benchmarks.
