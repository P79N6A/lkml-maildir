Here,
	br_add_if:
		schedule_delayed_work(&p->carrier_check, BR_PORT_DEBOUNCE);
schedule_delayed_work() fails if this bit is set. So the only difference with
this patch is:
	before:
		schedule_delayed_work() fails unless port_carrier_check() passed
		work_release() (before rtnl_lock())
	after:
		schedule_delayed_work() fails unless run_workqueue() cleared this
		bit (before calling port_carrier_check())
