The problem is likely what device struct you are passing to
dma_sync_single_for_device(), it has to be a real pci_dev or similar
that has it's dev_archdata properly initialized.
I bet dev_archdata in whatever "struct device" is being passed in has
a NULL iommu pointer or something like that.
Oh yeah, I see what you're doing, that won't work, please pass in
the correct device struct pointer.  Please pass in the &pci_dev->dev
not this ohci->card.device thing.
