I know I'm comming kinda late, but I'm using:
export GIT_PROXY_COMMAND=/usr/local/bin/proxy-cmd.sh
and proxy-cmd.sh is just single-line command glued from what I found 
available in /bin:
#! /bin/bash
(echo "CONNECT $1:$2 HTTP/1.0"; echo; cat ) | socket 
proxy.ourcompany.com 3128 | (read a; read a; cat )
Replace socket's arguments 'proxy.ourcompany.com 3128' with your http 
proxy.  Fortunately our proxy does not see anything wrong with git's port.
