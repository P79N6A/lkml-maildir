OK, good.  I've fixed another bug related to MMAPed stuff (for the 
people that like to play Quake on these sound cards).  I've put up a 
0.08 version of the file on my web page.  If people could please verify 
that this version works for them I would appreciate it.  Once I've 
gotten a few "It works here" reports and no "It blew my computer up" 
reports, I'll submit it to Marcello and Linus so we can finally get 
these things working a bit more reliably.
Highlights of this release:
Fix GETOPTR and GETIPTR (thinko/typo in an if statement)
Fix i810_poll() (side effect of fixing overrun/underrun handling in 0.06)
Make handling of dmabuf->trigger more consistent throughout the source code
