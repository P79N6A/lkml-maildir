Very clever. But probably too fragile for various reasons. A ring of
say 30 buffers might be less fragile and simpler.
As others have pointed out a new format specifier would be the best
solution. Extending gcc function attributes for checking the format
string would be necessary. IMHO the time is right to push this into
egcs/gcc, at least for IPv6 addresses.
It can all be done (also for IPv4) such, that a ring buffer fallback
for earlier gcc versions would handle the current situation with the
many gcc versions out there gracefully.
