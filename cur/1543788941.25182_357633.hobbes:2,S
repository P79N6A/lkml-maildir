I usually recommend doing a 'sleep 10'.  It really shows you if things are
wrong.  If a sleep 1 returns 2 seconds, or 0.5 seconds later it may not be
detected.  But a sleep 10 returning 20 seconds or 5 seconds later is
obvious.
Just my 20 cents (inflation - and like my comment I multiplied by 10 ;-)
