Take 2.6.17-mm1, apply the hotfix, then apply this patch from 2.6.17-mm2 also:
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.17/2.6.17-mm2/broken-out/reiserfs-reorganize-bitmap-loading-functions-fix2.patch
That should make 2.6.17-mm1's reiserfs work. (This way you can at
least see whether your 2.6.17-mm2 bug happens under -mm1 as well.)
