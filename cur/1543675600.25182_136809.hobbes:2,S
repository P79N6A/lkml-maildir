I was about to concede to you: just because the pages are shared doesn't
mean that _you_ have to be overanxious about immediately forcing changes
to be visible to userspace (though it would be unfriendly if updates were
to appear at lesser granularity than PAGE_SIZE: I've no idea whether
that's a possibility), the "unspecified" would allow that much - but
wouldn't allow you to show portions of entirely other files!
But I've just remembered the peculiar VM_SHARED handling in mm/mmap.c:
open a file O_RDONLY, mmap it PROT_READ MAP_SHARED, and the vma will be
put on the i_mmap list, not on the i_mmap_shared list.  So the i_mmap
list can actually contain shared mappings, not just private mappings.
Poor naming certainly: the i_mmap_shared list is for mappings though
which the object might be modified.
