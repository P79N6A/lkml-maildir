It would be interesting to compare 2.6.18 with 2.6.19-rc to see why the 
first gets only errors while the second is able to transfer some data 
using 4 KB chunks.
(By the way, what do you mean by 4 KB chunks or 1 MB chunks?  Does this 
refer to the bs= option for dd?  That has almost nothing to do with the 
size of the transfers actually sent to the device.)
But the log will be useless unless you turn on CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DEBUG.
