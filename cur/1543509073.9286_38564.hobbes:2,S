If resource code is to work in the kernel, presumeably you should
__request_region() [note leading '__'] before ioremap, or talking to
that hardware mem or I/O region at all.  Including ISA-style probing to
various ports, and other init-only tasks like that.

Multiple base addresses is common for video cards and on the Meteor-II
framegrabber at least.  The audio codec built into my motherboard has
two I/O ports.  And my IDE controller has a single I/O base at PCI
region #4!
What is your suggestion for a solution to the issues I outlined, two
e-mails previous?  Have two sets of pci scan code, one that works well
with video drivers, and one that works well with net drivers?  I do not
think that is optimal.
IMHO It would be nice to either expand your pci-scan code, which is fine
with me, or make my suggested code handle some of the features it
currently lacks, like CardBus support via the cb hooks and
drv_register/unregister scheme.  If I have time tonight, I'll see if I
can post a patch which does this.
Regards,
