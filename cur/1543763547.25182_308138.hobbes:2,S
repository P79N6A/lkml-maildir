 With later request_fn() rewrite patch, all state checking are moved
to request_fn() and gets terminated with __scsi_done().  prep_fn()
only kills invalid (so, unprepped) requests.  It's in the fixed bugs
list of the request_fn() rewrite patch.  BTW, there's one more path
which leaks cmnd/sgtable, the end_that_request_*() on offline path of
request_fn() which is also fixed by request_fn() rewrite patch.
 I'm sorry about not mentioning that the bug is fixed in the later
patch.  Please review request_fn() rewrite patch.

 Yeah, I like not overwriting ->special, and removing magic is always
good. :-)
 Hmmm, I have another proposal.  What do you think about replacing
scsi_request with scsi_cmnd.  I've been looking into it and it doesn't
seem to be too much work and it won't cause problems.  The only
bothering thing is that scsi_cmnd is limited resource and should be
returned to the pool ASAP.  AFAIK, all current users of
scsi_allocate_request() releses the scsi_request as soon as they're
finished, and we can make the requirement clear in the comment
(i.e. do not cache or hold on to scsi_cmnd).  This will remove the
scsi_request/cmnd dance and make scsi midlayer slimmer in other
places.  What do you think?
 Thanks.
