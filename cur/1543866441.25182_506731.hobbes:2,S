The dev_t is a good example for the mess we try to fix here. Not having
a dev_t for "devices" lead to the creation of a lot of otherwise
completely useless "class devices" which are just a total pain to
interpret, and follow the events they create, from userspace.
Things like the scsi_device devices, usb_device devices, ... just exist,
because only this type of devices was allowed to pass information for
device nodes to userspace.
Thanks,
