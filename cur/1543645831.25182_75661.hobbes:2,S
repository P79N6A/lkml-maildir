I used the kernel driver about 9 months ago but it wasn't reliable, the 
userspace driver is brilliantly reliable and also I don't have to patch the 
kernel, just looked at 2.5.40 and see it's in the kernel but I have been 
using 2.4 till recently but there is still the speedmgmt application which 
used to hang the machine on shutdown  and also when the link was dropped and 
you also need a ATM aware PPP daemon so the userpace driver is IMHO simpler 
use.
Moving /usr/sbin/usbmodules to /usr/sbin/usbmodules.orig stops the kernel 
panic, I get the following on boot
Starting hotplug subsystem: usb** can't synthesize root hub events.
Thanks
