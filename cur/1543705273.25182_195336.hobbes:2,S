Subject: RAID arrays not reconstructing in 2.6

I saw this a couple of weeks ago in a 2.6.0-test kernel, and today in
2.6.2-rc3.  When I have to hit the hard reset button on my desktop, whose
root filesystem is RAID5 on /dev/md0, it comes back up cleanly - no
reconstruction.
Have we gotten a whole lot more enthusiastic about marking superblocks clean
lately, or should I be worried?  Obviously this always used to trigger
reconstruction, until recently.
