Yes, I see. But many-many framebuffer code (and will) exists for various cards
and you can't know their exact speed so you don't know how often should be
schedule() inserted. (accelerated framebuffer code may not need but some old
video cards require it much often). But a kernel thread introduces problems
you mentioned ...
However if framebuffer become a true standard with accelerated functions and
like, some cards/drivers will have got the some problem : locking the
kernel too long ... A general solution would be wonderful ...
