But the title of the section is "Software Accessible D3 (D3hot)", isn't it?
And the first paragraph of the section is
"Functions in D3hot must respond to configuration space accesses as long as
power and clock are supplied so that they can be returned to D0 by software."
If this doesn't imply D3hot to D0 transition being discussed in the next
paragraph, then I don't know what it's there for.

IMO, pci_set_power_state() is correct and your problem is related to something
else.
