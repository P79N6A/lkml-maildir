To whom it may concern...
Maybe I haven't told you yet, but I get paid to surf the Web. Really!
I recently joined AllAdvantage.com, a new company that pays its members to
surf the Web - and they've been paying out hundreds of thousands of dollars
to members since July.
What's the catch? There is no catch. Membership is totally free and private.
To earn money you agree to download a small message window -- called a
Viewbar - on your desktop. The Viewbar delivers information about products
and services available online.
AllAdvantage.com is for real:
Their Web site was the 12th most-visited property on the Web in October.
Last month, more than 30 AllAdvantage.com members earned well over US$1,000
EACH and the top earner pulled in over US$4,400!
The company has more than 3 million members worldwide, but there are still
75 million active online users (in the US and Canada alone) who are still
waiting to hear about AllAdvantage.com and become members. Be sure you're
the first to tell them about it!
The sooner you join, the sooner you'll get paid. Please use my referral ID
number (cnk033), because I get paid when you sign up and surf. Be sure to
tell all your friends who use the Internet -- the more referrals we get, the
more money we can earn. You can sign up with AllAdvantage.com right away at
http://www.alladvantage.com/go.asp?refid=cnk033
This is a really great deal with no strings attached!
Sincerely,
Christian G Denis
