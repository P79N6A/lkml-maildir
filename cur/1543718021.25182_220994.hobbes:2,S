Although I like deleting things as much as the next guy :) I do have a 
question, to which I haven't come up with a good answer myself:
Should PC9800 be excised en masse, or just toss the obviously broken or 
not-in-any-makefile/Kconfig pieces?
The PC9800 net driver stuff still seems to build, and be sane.
