if different IRQs are delivered to different CPUs, then there is no global
spinlock connection between them. Also see /proc/irq/*/smp_affinity. Eg.  
if we localize a given IRQ to a single CPU, another IRQ source to another
CPU then they will no more interact with each other. But the effect is
there even in the generic case where APIC IRQs typically come in groups.
(ie. the same CPU is used as a target for several IRQs, then another CPU
is picked.)
