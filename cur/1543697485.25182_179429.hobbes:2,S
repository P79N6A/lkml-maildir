For changedfiles, essentially a device special that
reports file operations, e.g.
OPENW /home/foo/filename
MKDIR /home/foo/bar
RENAME /home/foo/bar -> /home/foo/goo
The userspace deamon reads the operations and files,
and compares then to regexp rules in the config file
i.e, for an automatic image converter:
RULE ^/home/dropbox/*.gif
SHELL /usr/bin/convert __FILE__ `basename __FILE__
.jpg`
It also does in process FTP, so you can do poor man's
replication to a remote machine without the overhead
of polling.
