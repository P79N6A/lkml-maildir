Take a look to the MAX3100 chip:
http://pdfserv.maxim-ic.com/arpdf/MAX3100.pdf
This solution highly reduce the CPU overhead needed to sample Rx line 
for each single bit. The chip have a FIFO, an interrupt and look like a 
standard UART. Only the bus transfert with the CPU is different.
I curently work on a driver for it.
