Well.  Half of it has gone so far ;)

(I meant a really big fillmem: a couple of 2GB ones.  Not to worry.)
It's not in slab and the pagecache and anonymous memory stuff seems to be
working OK.  So it has to be something else, which does a bare
__alloc_pages().  Low-level block stuff, networking, arch code, perhaps.
I don't think I've ever really seen code to diagnose this.
A simplistic approach would be to add eight or so ulongs into struct page,
populate them with builtin_return_address(0...7) at allocation time, then
modify sysrq-m to walk mem_map[] printing it all out for pages which have
page_count() > 0.  That'd find the culprit.
