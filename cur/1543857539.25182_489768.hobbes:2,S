However, nothing stops you wrapping the non-portable nature of ll/sc up
into the store part though.
If you can efficiently implement cmpxchg inside an ll/sc based portable
interface (yes you can) and you can implement problematical ll/sc
structures inside a cmpxchg() interface, you can do it either way around.
Only one way doesn't penalise broken ll/sc based implementations though.
That is the essence of my argument.
