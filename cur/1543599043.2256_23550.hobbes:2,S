There is some minimal heuristics in the readahead code that tries to
reduce the windows if things donnot work as expected. I donnot remember
exactly as they work. May-be I should re-read the code. What the code
wants is to perform *asynchronous* read-ahead in order to elimate IO
latency for sequential IO streaming patterns.
For hard disks connected to a fast HBA, large read-ahead is not necessary.
For example, un Cheetah drive can handle more than 8000 short IOs per
second and a SYMBIOS chip using the SYM53C8XX driver can handle more than
15000 short IOs per seconds.
The larger the read-ahead chunks, the more likely trashing will occur. In
my opinion, using more than 128 K IO chunks will not improve performances
with modern hard disks connected to a reasonnably fast controller, but
will increase memory pressure and probably thrashing.
It is a different story for some external RAID boxes that may perform
better using hudge IO chunks. Such boxes have poor firmware in my opinion.
Some tunability of the read-ahead algorithm will be useful for sure, but
not that much, in my opinion. I am under the impression that using some
MAX READ AHEAD value in the range 64K-128K and given the current
heuristics in the code, a subsystem using hard disks connected to a decent
controller will perform close to the best for most IO patterns. This let
me think, that there is no miracle to expect from a tunability of the
read-ahead. (Excepted if stupid external RAID boxes are involved,
obviously).

  Gérard.
