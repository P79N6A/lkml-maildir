Putting multiple modules in puts a higher load on the address and data lines
supplying the sockets; apparently those two modules are too much of a load for
your motherboard.  You didn't notice a problem in Windows because it doesn't
push the hardware quite as hard.
If your board supports registered (buffered) DIMMs, that would likely solve
your problem.
