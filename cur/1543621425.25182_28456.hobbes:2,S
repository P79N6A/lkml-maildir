Cute. Eric - can you confirm that if you drop this .config in place with 
CML2 and run 'make oldconfig', nothing gets changed? Or at least justify 
individually any changes which _do_ happen.
In fact, a useful test suite would be to make randomconfig, then oldconfig 
with CML2 and CML1, verifying that there are no changes.
