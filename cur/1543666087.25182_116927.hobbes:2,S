But it's a memory leak in the game, not the kernel. They should
complain to the game makers. If a game runs the system out of
memory so a user can't log in on the root account and kill off
the game, it's a problem with the game.
--and I don't know what a 'serious game' is. Perhaps its what
the student is doing instead of studying so future engineers
develop that necessary hand-eye coordination. It's great
in design reviews, can swap hands and get a beat in between.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
