I tried first the test with dd, the results are similar to those of FFSB 
tests, about 15 percent of degradation between 2.6.20.7 and 2.6.21-rc7.
I'm using the CFQ I/O scheduler. I changed it to the "deadline" one and 
I don't have any more the problem, I've got similar throughput values 
with 2.6.20.7 and 2.6.21-rc7 kernels.
So can we conclude that it's due to the CFQ scheduler?
I also checked the device driver used, the revision number is the same 
in 2.6.20 and 2.6.21.
