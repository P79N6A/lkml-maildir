I wasn't clear enough... Let me try again with different words.
If you look at your patch, you will see that the only use of the label
'clear_caps:' is as a jump target from a location in which rc=0. As
such, you will *not* clear the bprm->cap_* sets... This is the reverse
of what you intended to do.
You need to put the jump target 'inside' the 'if (rc) { <-here ... }'.
Cheers
Andrew
