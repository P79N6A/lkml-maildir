Yep.

But the patch is very dangerous. Unsuspecting users will see their
systems resumed after unsafe initrd is ran. It is okay for you,
through..
What you want to do si to audit your initrd, then add echo to
/sys/power/resume at the end...

Yes, but not this way. -rc2 already contains
/sys/power/resume... (Better documentation would be needed, through).
