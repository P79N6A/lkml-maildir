   E801 is, I'm afraid, a bit of a minefield;  it suffered from coming into
   existance about the same time as E820 did, and thus a lot of vendors who
   implemented E820 just had E801 return bogus nonsense (like the Award
   bioses on a bunch of FIC PA210?'s I own, which tell the kernel that
   the system has 500+mb of core when it only has 128.)
   I suspect that the next round of a E820 memory detect I'll do will
   simply blow away E801 instead of ignoring it if E820 works.

   I believe that you need to pass the size of the memory record in (in ecx)
   so unless the BIOS is severely broken it won't randomly walk over memory
   no matter how much it wants to return.

    david parsons \bi/ E820 memory detection for 1.2.13, anyone?
