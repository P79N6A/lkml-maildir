 > Alpha uses a generic futex implementation, which causes some problems [1].
Summarizing this: the generic futex implementation leaves
futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() as a stub that just returns -ENOSYS, and
glibc robust futex code can't handle this return value, which leads to
glibc tests hanging.

Presumably native implementations can use optimized assembly, which
would be somewhat faster than a generic implementation in C.

I don't know for sure, but I would guess it's just that no one has cared
enough about optimizing futexes on alpha.
A native implementation for alpha is probably an amusing project, but
also figuring out a way of implementing the missing operations for
generic futexes would be nice too (given that glibc uses them now).
Although a generic futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() that works for SMP
might be tricky.
