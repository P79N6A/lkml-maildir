Exactly! Just imagine what the current ext2_sync_file() implementation
does to you with a 1 GB file and a few fsyncdata() per second.
The only viable workaround so far is the patch from Scott Laird
which reverts to fsync_dev() depending on file size.
This patch looks like the right approach.

Depending on database activity and transaction size this could 
easily use much more than 4 blocks.

From my experience, going through the triple indirect blocks is 
always calling for trouble. So if it takes too much overhead to keep 
a bigger list of dirtied blocks, we might as well fall back to 
fsync_dev() for bigger files.

We could use a more scalable algorithm, so having more entries would 
not make such a big difference. 
There is a tradeoff depending on usage: If you are dealing with 
rather big files and use fdatasync() it makes a difference if you can 
avoid the ext2_sync_file(). If not, you may not like the write() 
performance beeing affected.

Define "typical".  This depends on application software and
transaction
strategy and could vary for customers and db implementation.
Even with moderate database sizes (1 few 100 MB) having a larger list
of blocks would almost always be a big win.

I plan to run some performance tests during this week. I will add
some code to check for number of blocks dirtied between fsync().
I won't consider that "typical" though. It's just another datapoint.
It's probably also interesting to compare your patch against the 
fsync_dev() workaround.
