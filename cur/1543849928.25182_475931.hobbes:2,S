 Hi,
 I noticed that commit 4e8a5201506423e0241202de1349422af4260296 on Linus' tree 
titled "[PKT_SCHED] netem: Orphan SKB when adding to queue." also touches the 
file "drivers/pci/quirks.c", which seems unrelated.
 Was this intentional? 
 If so, then I'm sorry for the noise...
 Best regards
Claudio Martins
