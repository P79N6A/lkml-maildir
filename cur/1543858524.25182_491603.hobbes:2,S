This time everything which was in linux1394-2.6.git before the post
2.6.19 merge window went into 2.6.20-rc1. However it wasn't much
substantial stuff; we didn't get much done during the past few months.
Here is my pull message:

You can patch the ieee1394 drivers in 2.6.{19,18,16.x} to nearly the
same level as in 2.6.20-rc1 (that is, minus changesets which only
address in-kernel API changes) by means of the patchkit v212 from
http://me.in-berlin.de/~s5r6/linux1394/merged/.
 However I'm 99.9% sure
that it won't fix the problems you got.

That's right.

These security issues are partly inherent to the IEEE 1394 architecture,
if I may say so. Dan Dennedy has a patch as work in progress to improve
raw1394's security towards devices as far as possible (while still
allowing non-root users access to /dev/raw1394, unless the administrator
thinks otherwise).
The other issue is security of the local host against attacks from
malicious external devices or other PCs. Here the issue is with
OHCI-1394's physical DMA feature and the fact that the sbp2 driver needs
it enabled. I'm planning to implement filtered physical DMA as a simple
security improvement and, at some day in a /distant/ future, implement a
DMA mapping in sbp2 to work completely without physical DMA.
(Anyway, that's unrelated to Gene's issues.)
