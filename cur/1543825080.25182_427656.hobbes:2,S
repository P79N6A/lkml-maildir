yeah, that could work. Have fbdev-core handle all PCI interactions and 
drm-core uses those functions.

Not exactly. drm-chip would depend on fbdev-chip and drm-core, which both 
depend on fbdev-core -- not a direct dependency. However, the layering model 
you present would likely keep the embedded people happy. Provided the 
drm-chip and fbdev-chip interfaces are kept seperate. Such a seperation need 
only hold true for the current generation of fbdev drivers. New drivers added 
at a later date could be unified drm/fbdev-chip modules or split, as the 
creator determines.

Okay. That works. I wasn't going to worry about the embedded stuff, so much as 
try to keep a clean division of things so stuff the embedded people don't 
need isn't used.
