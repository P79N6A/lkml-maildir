:) unusual request.
The proglet below, which someone posted a while back, should meet your
needs nicely.  Fire up a few copies in the background with args like
5000 6000 7000 8000 9000.., and mplayer should become decidedly unhappy.
The scheduler round robin schedules tasks which it has classified as
interactive (tasks which sleep somewhat regularly basically) at a higher
rate than their timeslice to reduce latency, but the more tasks
circulating at the same priority (or above) as mplayer, the bigger the
latency hit mplayer will take.
