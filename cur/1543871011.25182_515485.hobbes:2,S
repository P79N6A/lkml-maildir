Well, as a matter of fact (on my system):
# ls -l /dev/std*
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 4 Feb  1  2006 /dev/stderr -> fd/2
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 4 Feb  1  2006 /dev/stdin -> fd/0
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 4 Feb  1  2006 /dev/stdout -> fd/1
Please don't bother to respond to this mail, I just saw that you 
apparently needed the info.
