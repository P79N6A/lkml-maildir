How did you manage to burn a dual layer disc? I have been completely 
unsuccessful at doing this at all. :(

I didn't look into it, but my cdrecord seems to work fine as my normal user 
(writing via cdrw group w/ perms), but not with suid-root.

Provided it doesn't allow burning files the real-user shouldn't be able to 
access... But since cdrecord is commonly suid-root, I presume this has long 
been taken into consideration.

Aren't user-groups per-session anyway? Why not simply have the login program 
apply a 'localusers' group to all local sessions and set device permissions 
for that group? To add to the security, perhaps there is a way to remove the 
'localusers' permissions from all backgrounded processes (screen, etc) when 
the user logs out?
