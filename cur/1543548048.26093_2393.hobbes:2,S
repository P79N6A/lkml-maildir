Just the one... this'll take a parameter specifying the Win32 call to make:
     int win32(int fd, enum win32op, void *args, u_int *win32error)
The fd is currently used to find the Win32 handle map, which is attached to
struct file->f_private on that fd. I don't know any other way of doing this at
the moment (at least so the handle map automatically gets destroyed when the
owning process expires).
One thing that might be useful in this regard is the ability to add callbacks
into a list on the task structure, such that they are invoked when the process
exits/execs (and at no other time).

Yes... that's a good idea... I already use a /proc file to provide access to
the kernel module, I can just extend that.

Unless I can get one reserved, though I suspect that won't happen.

That is actually quite a big problem... How do you stop someone accessing the
syscall whilst the module's cleanup function is running, but before it has a
chance to clear the syscall slot? Does module unloading lock out other
syscalls?
This may require some sort of in-the-main-kernel syscall register/unregister
functionality that takes a handler pointer _and_ a module definition pointer.
