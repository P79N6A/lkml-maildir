After updating my local tree to the latest linux-next and starting a clean 
build I see this error *ONLY* the first time I start a "make bzImage"
  CC      arch/x86/kernel/acpi/sleep.o
  LDS     arch/x86/kernel/acpi/realmode/wakeup.lds
cc1: fatal error: opening output file 
arch/x86/kernel/acpi/realmode/wakeup.lds: Permission denied
compilation terminated.
make[4]: *** [arch/x86/kernel/acpi/realmode/wakeup.lds] Error 1
make[3]: *** [arch/x86/kernel/acpi/realmode/wakeup.bin] Error 2
make[2]: *** [arch/x86/kernel/acpi] Error 2
make[1]: *** [arch/x86/kernel] Error 2
make: *** [bzImage] Error 2
Restarting the build brings it through to completion. I've checked and there 
is no reason that this error should occur.
