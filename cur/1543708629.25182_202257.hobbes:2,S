Linux version 2.4.24 doesn't "disable" a spurious interrupt!
When you unload the driver, you deallocate the interrupt you
are using (I sure hope so). When you load the driver again,
you reallocate the interrupt. If you FAILED to release the
IRQ when you unloaded the module, guess what? It's still
allocated and you can't have it anymore. That's probably
what's happening.
