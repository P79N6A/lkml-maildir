Linux Cluster Summit 2005
June 20 and 21, Walldorf, Germany (Near Heidelberg)
Sponsors: Red Hat, SAP AG, Oracle, HP, and Fujitsu-Siemens.
The goal of the two-day Linux Cluster Summit workshop is to bring
together the key individuals who can realize a general purpose
clustering API for Linux, including, kernel components, userspace
libraries and internal and external interfaces.  Results of this
workshop will be presented to the Kernel Summit the following month.
The workshop is to be held in Walldorf, the hometown of SAP, Europe's 
biggest software company.
This is in the south/central part of Germany, in an adjoining town of 
Heidelberg.  Frankfurt and France (order the menu!) are within easy 
driving distance.  It is very picturesque.  There is a lot to see and 
do in the vicinity for those who are interested.  We are planning a 
field trip for the day following the workshop for those who want to 
stay an extra day and see some sights.  Details have not been finalized 
yet.  Note that June 21 is the first day of tutorials at LinuxTag and 
June 22 is the LinuxTag Business Congress.  You will be able to attend 
the rest of LinuxTag if you wish.  It's free!
Unfortunately, space is limited. We can accommodate about 100 attendees. 
Registration is by invitation for 70 participants, including those who 
attended last year, and 30 seats are available on a first come, first 
served basis. There is no charge for this workshop.  You will only be 
need to arrange travel and accommodation.  A list of recommended hotels 
and other accommodation will be posted here.
The full agenda will be posted here, in the next few days:
