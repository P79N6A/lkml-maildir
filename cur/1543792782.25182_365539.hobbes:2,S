Subject: [PATCH 04/15] mm: update split ptlock Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Closer attention to the arithmetic shows that neither ppc64 nor sparc
really uses one page for multiple page tables: how on earth could they,
while pte_alloc_one returns just a struct page pointer, with no offset?
Gasp, splutter... arm26 manages it by returning a pte_t pointer cast to
a struct page pointer, then compensating in its pmd_populate.  That's
almost as evil as overlaying a struct page with a spinlock_t.  But arm26
is never SMP, and we now only poison when SMP, so it's not a problem.
And the PA-RISC situation has been recently improved: CONFIG_PA20
works without the 16-byte alignment which inflated its spinlock_t.
