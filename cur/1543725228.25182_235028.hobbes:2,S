I tried it now, and it indeed made a huge difference!
And the effect was not a big failure to detect the
disks as I expected, but.. the first kernel I tried
(2.6.8-rc1) booted without any noticeable error or
problem! (and windows xp was not affected)
I'm completely baffled about this, and I'm left with
two questions:
1. why?
2. does it have any negative side-effect (e.g. related
to disk transfer performance)?
Thanks a lot!
Adrian
