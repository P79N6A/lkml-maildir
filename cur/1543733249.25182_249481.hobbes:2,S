This  is rather  a  fud argument:  both  the gnome  VFS  code and  the
KIOserver/KIOslave  code aren't really  large. You  don't want  to use
them for a busybox/tinylogin system, however.

The files  still work well, just  that you can't access  them over the
old fancy URL schemes.

Actually,  practical  discordianism.  If  you develop  a  common  API,
there'll always be people disagreeing.
GTK+ with all  its features is just cool. Desktop  warping is a really
nice  thing. But  there are  people out  there who  don't want  to use
it. They use QT, or even plain old Athena Widgets. So what? Will we be
implementing the X toolkits into the kernel?
In case of marketing it's up to the distributions to provide something
concise  so  everyone  can  use  their  programs  through  a  coherent
namespace. (I.e. port all the apps they ship to gnome-vfs or kio).
