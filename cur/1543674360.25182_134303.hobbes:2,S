Hi!
When the kernel is booted ( ia32 version at least ) , it reads
the time from from the hardware CMOS clock , _assumes_ it is in
UTC and set the system time to it.
As almost nobody runs their clock in UTC, this means that the system
is running on wrong time until some userspace tool corrects it.
This can lead to situtation when time goes backwards :
timezone is 2hours east of UTC.
UTC time : 20:00
local time : 22:00
System time between boot and userspace fix : 22:00UTC
System time after fix : 20:00UTC
Comments ?
