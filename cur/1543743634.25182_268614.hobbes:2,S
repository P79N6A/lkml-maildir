Um, again?  This is the first I've heard from you.  BTW, Gerard seems to
be unreachable, which is why I took over the driver.

Sounds like your drive isn't negotiating the correct transfer rate.
If it's able to do 30MB/s, I guess it should be negotiating at least
wide, 20MHz -- 5MB/s sounds like asynchronous.

Hrm.  Domain validation is failing.  I bet what's going on is that the
controller is U160-capable, so we're sending a PPR message to the drive
which is going haywire.  I do hope we don't have to start blacklisting
drives as being PPR-incapable.
Can you turn on negotiation debugging and send me the result?  If you
have 2.1.18m, that's sym53c8xx.debug=0x200 ... earlier than that, it's
sym53c8xx=debug:0x200
Now ... you say:

Do you mean the machine freezes at this point, or you can't boot because
this drive has your root partition on it and it can't be found?  If the
former, this is another bug that needs to be fixed.
