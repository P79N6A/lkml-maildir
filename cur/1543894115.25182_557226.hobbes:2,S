Yes, I did misunderstood you.
The reason I can't use class-wide resume support is that since we
can't have class hierarchy we have mess of different objects dumped
into single pool (input_dev, evdev. mousedev, joydev, tsdev all relate
to /sys/class/input). And so instead of having class define standard
interface for all objects in it we have to rely on something else
(struct device_type - not visible fom userspace) to separate them and
add tweaks to interface. Can you see that I am not a fan of the
design? ;)
As far as input concerned - I need to resume input_dev but not evdev,
mousedev, tsdev, etc. as they are all just different representations
of the same object.

It could be done within the class_device infrastructure as well.

No, it will stay.
