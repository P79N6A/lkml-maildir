PREEMPT_RT doesn't do that. If you from Linux request to disable irqs or
preemption you just do it. Nothing in PREEMPT_RT prevents you. There is no
"software emulation" involved at all. Redefining spin_lock() to mean
lock_mutex() is clearly not the same as putting in a sub-kernel and
redifiing cli()/sti() in Linux, which is what the patent covers.

Neither am I. But I know if I start to interpret patens that way I would
have to stop writing software right now as every line of code would be
covered by some patent if you start to look at it your way.
