I've checked since 2005, and valgrind was still horribly broken wrt UML.

Don't think so.  With what I get on FC5 (valgrind-3.1.0), I get this:
==31913== Jump to the invalid address stated on the next line
==31913==    at 0x9: ???
==31913==    by 0xBEC1599A: ???
==31913==    by 0x696C2F69: ???
==31913==  Address 0x9 is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd
==31913== 
==31913== Process terminating with default action of signal 11 (SIGSEGV): dumping core
UML is cloning a thread in order to test the host's ptrace.  However,
it looks like valgrind is branching to 0x9 for some reason.
This particular bit is going to be problematic for other reasons, but
if valgrind ever looks like it has a chance of working, I can work
around that in UML.
