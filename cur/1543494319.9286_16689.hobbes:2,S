   No good... it's trivial for the malicious user to bypass the
   simple-minded check.  The general problem is uncomputable.
If you mark read-only pages as clean after you scan them, and do
checks on ITLB misses for pages which have been written to, plus add a
special hook in the kernel for the dynamic linker to write instruction
relocations efficiently in the face of this, I believe it can be done
without too much of a performance hit for dynamic linking.
