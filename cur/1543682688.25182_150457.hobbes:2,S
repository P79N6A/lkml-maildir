Well, isn't asking about address_space_operations.readpage
specific enough?

The discussion was about putting variables (or arrays or large
structs) the kernel programmer defines on the stack, and I do
not think architecture calling convention has much to do with
this.
If an architecture has a big stack usage per call that is
imposed by the ABI, and larger kernel stack is allocated
compared to other architectures because of this reason,
shouldn't there be about the same amount of usable space left
for the kernel programs within the allocated per-process kernel
stack space to use?  If that is not the case then the port to
that particular architecture would not be optimal, wouldn't it?
