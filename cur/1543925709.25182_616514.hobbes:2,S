Subject: [PATCH] sigwait eats blocked default-ignore signals
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

While a signal is blocked, it must be posted even if its action is
SIG_IGN or is SIG_DFL with the default action to ignore.  This works
right most of the time, but is broken when a sigwait (rt_sigtimedwait)
is in progress.  This changes the early-discard check to respect
real_blocked.  ~blocked is the set to check for "should wake up now",
but ~(blocked|real_blocked) is the set for "blocked" semantics as
defined by POSIX.
