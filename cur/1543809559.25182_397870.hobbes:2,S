From what i understand it will fix the problem only if the drive is in
PIO mode, which is the case for  Folkert van Heusden, who reported the
same BUG output.
However it does not appear that my cdrom drives are using PIO, from the
logs i have they're supposed to use DMA :

sudo /sbin/hdparm -i /dev/hdc
/dev/hdc:

 UDMA modes: udma0 udma1 *udma2

So i think this patch won't do me any good :(
any other idea ????
Thanks for the answer.
