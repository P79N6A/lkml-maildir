I actually misread the tables.  It appears that MCFG (at 0x7f6e2e36) is
in ACPI Data (7f6d0000 - 7f6e3000).  include/asm-i386/e820.h says that
memory marked as "E820_ACPI" can be reused as normal memory once the
ACPI tables have been read.
Doesn't this mean that the MCFG memory could end up being used as
general system memory?  That seems bad if MCFG memory is some kind of
MMIO space.  Or is the comment simply wrong?
(I don't really know what this stuff is, so maybe I'm just pointlessly
worrying.)
