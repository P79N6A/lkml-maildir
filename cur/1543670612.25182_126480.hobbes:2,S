It's been working for a very long time... Have you the latest modutils
from Rusty Rusell? The module format and loader changed at 2.5.48 (if I
remember correctly). If you use an older modutils, you'll get a lot of
errors when doing "make modules_install".
You can download modutils from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules
