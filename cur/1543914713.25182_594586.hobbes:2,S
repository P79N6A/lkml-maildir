Hmm, maybe I misunderstood.  I assumed that create_irq() was also called
later to get irqs for any devices which appeared later.  Although I can
at least check it's not in use.
The current lguest patch uses it like so (syscall_vector is a module
parameter):
int init_interrupts(void)
{
	/* If they want some strange system call vector, reserve it now */
	if (syscall_vector != SYSCALL_VECTOR
	    && test_and_set_bit(syscall_vector, used_vectors)) {
		printk("lg: couldn't reserve syscall %u\n", syscall_vector);
		return -EBUSY;
	}
	return 0;
}
Thanks,
Rusty.
