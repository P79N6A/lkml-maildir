It should do a writeback of dirty data from the cpu cache, so that the device
may see it after pci_dma_sync_to_device_single() completes.

Some platforms do, some don't.  Sparc64 has PCI controller DMA caches but it's
cpu caches are fully coherent, for example.  On such a platform this new interface
is going to be a NOP, but on things like MIPS it will not be.
