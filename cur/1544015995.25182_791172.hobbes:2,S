I've checked that, the blockdev_superblock doesn't have a back pointer
to vfsmount indeed, and can never use vfsmount anymore, although
generally it needs more testing.
Acked-by: Cheng Renquan <crquan@gmail.com>
To Al Viro: by this checking I found more vfsmount's not used, too, in
some other kern_mount'ed vfsmount, such as pipefs, sockfs, ipc mqueue,
selinux, smackfs, besides bdevfs, in such situations also only
superblock is used, the vfsmount only used as kern_mount and never
used anymore.
So maybe we can do some more cleanup. Patches will be sent later.
