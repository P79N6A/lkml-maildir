Could you make a list that splits the symbols up by each of the above
failure conditions?  It would make the task of deciding how to fix the
"problem" more apparent.
Also, it appears that some of the symbols you are matching are only in
documentation (which isn't necessarily a bad thing).  I would start with:
*.[chS] Config.in Makefile Configure.help
However, I'm not sure that your reasoning for removing these is correct.
For example, one symbol that I saw was CONFIG_EXT2_CHECK, which is code
that used to be enabled in the kernel, but is currently #ifdef'd out with
the above symbol.  When Ted changed this, he wasn't sure whether we would
need the code again in the future.  I enable it sometimes when I'm doing
ext2 development, but it may not be worthy of a separate config option
that 99.9% of people will just be confused about.
Cheers, Andreas
