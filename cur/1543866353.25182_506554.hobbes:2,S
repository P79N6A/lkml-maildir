So it looks like...
if (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEACPI=y)
	suspend uses _GTM
	resume uses _STM
But it looks like _GTF and using the task file is disabled by default,
and needs to be enabled by invoking "ide=acpigtf".  Why is that?
Also, what's the story on ide=acpionboot -- when/why is that expected
to be invoked, and why is it not the default?
thanks,
