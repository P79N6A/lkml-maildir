I don't care if it doesnt build with gcc 2.95. I keep telling people this.
It seems to work with 2.95 now except for a few odd driver bits.

Most of the asm fixes have been merged after they have been checked by gcc
folks I trust. And 2.2.14 is still the first kernel that is likely to work
vaguely reliable with gcc 2.9.5. Fundamental things like FPU emulation don't
build right in earlier kernels
