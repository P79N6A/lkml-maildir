Hi,
I used to listen mp3 files, using mpg123 -b 2048 -z (nice -15, for ex. -
sometimes I forget this!), without any interruption, even with
an relatively overloaded system! This was one
of my arguments when advertising Linux performance.
Now I'm getting, from times to times, some interruptions,
without any relevant workload.
I have noticed that when this happens, the kswapd task is allways
on the top of "top" program, CPU sorted.
....
Best regards,
Paulo da Silva
