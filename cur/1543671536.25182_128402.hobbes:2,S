The AIC 7xxx driver works fine. It should work on the same hardware as
79xx. 
The biggest AMD64 issue with drivers is normally IOMMU support, but
that only needs to concern you when you have more than 4GB of memory
and the hardware does not support 64bit Addresses. The Adaptec 
hardware supports 64bit addresses.
What's a problem is the "Adaptec RAID" - which uses the dpt_i2o driver.
That driver is not 64bit safe and doesn't work and is disabled.
