Provided you have enough memory, the somewhat better way to test this
is to turn off swap, copy the sources to a tmpfs directory and compile
there. Then any disks accesses would be only related to reloading code
pages from the compiler / daemons /shared libs, which having even more
ram would solve so that it's all compute bound. I guess even 1.5Gb of
ram is plenty for all this, and not so much costly nowdays for a
kernel hacker ;)
