Subject: [PATCH] [18/30] x86_64: Don't enable NUMA for a single node in K8 NUMA scanning
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This was supposed to see the full memory on a ASUS A8SX motherboard
with 4GB RAM where the northbridge reports less memory, but it didn't
help there. But it's a reasonable change so let's include it anyways.
