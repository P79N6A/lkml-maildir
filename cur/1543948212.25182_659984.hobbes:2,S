Alas, that all looks OK to me.
You never get any out-of-memory messages, and no oom-killing messages?
Possibly what is happening here is that in this low-memory condition, some
of the driver's internal memory-allocation attempts are failing, and the
driver isn't correctly handling this.  This is a rare situation which may
well not have been hit in anyone else's testing.
I expect that the Areca engineers will be able to reproduce this with a
suitably small "mem=" kernel boot option.  If not, they could perhaps
investigate the kernel's fault-injection framework, which permits
simulation of page allocation failures.
