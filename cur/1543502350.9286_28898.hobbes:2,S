Subject: [BUG] TCP connections between Linux and NT

[1.] One line summary of the problem:
   TCP connections between Linux and NT slows down very much (on a local
network)
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
   Any kind of TCP connections between a Linux (2.2.10) and a NT Server 4
(Service Pack 5) slow down to a crawl.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
Networking.
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.2.10 (root@hip) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #4 Wed Jul 7 
11:26:27 EEST 1999
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
N/A
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
A classical FTP sessions suffices to trigger the problem.
[7.] Environment
  The Linux server and the NT 4 (SP5) server are connected via a
(moderately loaded) 10MBps (twisted pair, non-switching hub) network. I
have attached the tcpdump of a FTP sessions from NT to Linux when the
network was idle. The tcpdump command line was:
tcpdump host hip and kobold and port ftp-data > kobold1
