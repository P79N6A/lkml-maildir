Hi there,
It is well known that Linux headers, which distributors put in /usr/include
in order to be used by Glibc, are often abused and mistakenly included by
userspace programs that don't actualy need kernel-specific features.
For example, some programmers prefer to include <linux/limits.h> instead of
<limits.h> to get a limit macro and break for all non-Linux-based systems while
they are at it.
When including a header directly is a wrong thing, the general tendency is to
simply disallow it. For example, Glibc headers use preprocessor commands in
the style of:
  #ifndef _STDIO_H
  # error "Never include <bits/stdio.h> directly; use <stdio.h> instead."
  #endif
Since there are a few legitimate uses of <linux/*.h> for userspace programs,
one could allow such by using the proper macro, something like:
  #ifndef _LINUX_SOURCE
  # error "blah"
  #endif
If you like the idea, I can send a patch for all this.
