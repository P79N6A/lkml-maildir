But cpus_allowed is inherited, so why does it matter?
The only benefit I see to having it part of the fork operation as
opposed to Ingo's or my own patch, is that the parent need not be given
the same affinity.
And honestly I don't see that as a need.  You could always change it
back after the exec.  If that is unacceptable (you point out the cost of
forcing a task on and off a certain CPU), you could just have a wrapper
you exec that changes its affinity and then it execs the children.
