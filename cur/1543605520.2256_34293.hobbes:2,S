Probably because they don't know the difference between kernel and 
user space.  Kinda understandable when you come from a Mac or Windows 
background, where (in the former) there is no distinction or (in the 
latter) it's so blurred as to make little difference.
And if they *do* understand it, from a dispassionate point of view, 
it does seem to make sense to put graphics drivers in the kernel - 
they're implemented as "device drivers" in every other desktop OS. 
Except MacOS X, where's it's an application layer like glibc, but 
nobody understand OS X yet beyond the hardest of developers.
But they don't realise that XFree86 has an *enormous* amount of 
developer time behind it, which would need to be duplicated to make 
it work in kernel space with full backwards compatibility.  Oh, and 
did I mention this would all be for one platform - XFree86 is 
designed to run on many!  It would also bloat the kernel tremendously.
