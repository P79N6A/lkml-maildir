Yes. The original structure is:
struct v4l2_framebuffer
{
        __u32                   capability;
        __u32                   flags;
        void*                   base;
        struct v4l2_pix_format  fmt;
};
Since this is used at ioctl definition, changing this would break
userspace apps. We might replace this to something like:
struct v4l2_framebuffer
{
        __u32                   capability;
        __u32                   flags;
	union {
	        void*		base_ptr; /*FOO definition to avoid breaking userpace apps */
		dma_addr_t	base;
	}
        struct v4l2_pix_format  fmt;
};
This way, base will have the expected type, and it won't break any
userspace app if sizeof(void *)<=sizeof(base). I think this is true for
all architectures (anyway, if it isn't, v4l is broken anyway).
What do you think?
Cheers, 
Mauro.
