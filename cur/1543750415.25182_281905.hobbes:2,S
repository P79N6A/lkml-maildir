Maybe I spoke too soon Alan, my logs are being flooded with 
some sort of an error message that looks like it may be memory
related.  There's a pair of half giggers in here, running at 333 fsb,
but they are supposedly rated for a 400 mhz fsb. Thats presumably
because I have turned on the MCE stuffs.

And I've not seen that before.  Does it have a simple and correct answer?
This memory was abused by memtest86 for about 18 hours before I rebooted
and started changing things around because it was a new motherboard
and video card, back in the spring.  No errors were reported then.
Should I worry or just shut that stuff back off?
