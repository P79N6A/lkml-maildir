Arrrrgh..I misread it as "or an error indicating that it is blocked"..
So treating it simply as NON_BLOCKING isn't right.

If it's a read, returning zero means end-of-file. Not sure what it means 
when recvmsg returns zero..But is this just the problem of UDP or 
recvmsg? I doubt it.
So I guess the easiest solution is just admit Linux select 
isn't posix compliant.
