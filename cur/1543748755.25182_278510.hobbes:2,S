I also doubt we can do significantly less per timer tick. There's some
new code and lock like the monotonic_lock but that's going to be lost in
the noise, the irq highlevel interface has some overhead too, but that's
going to be lost in the noise too. The rest pretty much cannot be
avoided. I didn't measure it but I suspect the slowest part might
actually be the outb_p/inb_p and the enter/exit kernel.
