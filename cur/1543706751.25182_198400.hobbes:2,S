There are 4 de facto standard serial ports:
COM1	0x3F8	IRQ4
COM2	0x2F8	IRQ3
COM3	0x3E8	IRQ4
COM4	0x2E8	IRQ3
If you have a port at 0x220, it is above the game-port area,
but not where the kernel should "look for" serial devices.
Therefore, you don't tell the kernel to, as you state, start
lower. Instead, you tell the kernel where they are by putting
them in the pnp_devices[] table.
Cheers,
