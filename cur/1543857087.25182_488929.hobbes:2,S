Subject: [PATCH] WorkStruct: Implement generic UP cmpxchg() where an arch doesn't support it [try #2]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/6/208

Implement generic UP cmpxchg() where an arch doesn't otherwise support it.
This assuming that the arch doesn't have support SMP without providing its own
cmpxchg() implementation.
This is required because cmpxchg() is used by the reduced work queue patches to
adjust the management data in a work_struct.
Also provide ARMv6 with a cmpxchg() implementation using LDREX/STREXEQ.  Pre-v6
ARM doesn't support SMP according to ARM's atomic.h, so the generic
IRQ-disablement based cmpxchg() is entirely adequate there (if it isn't, then
atomic_cmpxchg() is also broken on ARM).
