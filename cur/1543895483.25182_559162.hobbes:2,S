Well, *thar's* your problem!  :-)
I'm guessing you created the filesystem with mke2fs -T largefile4.
This basically told mke2fs that you anticipated the filesystem to have
an average inode size of 4 megabytes.  Given that your filesystem has
files ranging from 300k and 2mb, that's why you're running into
problems.
