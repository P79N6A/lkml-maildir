Subject: detecting a "USR 56k FAX INT" modem

Adding the following lines to serial.c allows my PNP "USR 56k FAX INT"
modem to be detected. The lines go in the list of devices (around line
4310).
	{	ISAPNP_VENDOR('U', 'S', 'R'), ISAPNP_DEVICE(0x3050), 0, 0,
		SPCI_FL_BASE0 | SPCI_FL_PNPDEFAULT, 1, 115200 },
It seems to work ok for my system. (Basically what I did was find the
right numbers from /proc/isapnp and clone the entry for the "ROCKWELL 56K
ACF")
