Hi.
Good news are, that I've got openhaptics (OS independent layer for sensable
devices) under academic license (I don't know, what the "open" word in that name
means -- no sourcecodes; licensed), the bad ones are, that they use ioctl
approach for both reporting and FF.
Furthermore I tried phantom with input layer in X and realized, that it's needed
to compute real axies from that numbers and that's what I'm doing in userspace
with doubke precision.
Ok, so the question is if the old ioctl approach (something which I posted as a
first patch before we ever starrted to talk about FF and input layer without
mmaping anything to US) is acceptable alone (this is what is needed for
OHaptics) or at least some particular computing to convert the numbers and
reporting to input layer should be implemented (which will have no users anyway,
who will ever want to have 60000$ pointer ;))?
thanks a lot,
