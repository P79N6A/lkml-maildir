As i have refactored some CC checking code in Kbuild.include, it
turned, that some versions of `make' after calling nested functions,
add (or leave) prefix whitespace to result, thus ifeq[0] fails:
 .-*- (ppc Makefile)
 |HAS_BIARCH      := $(call cc-option-yn, -m32)
0|ifeq ($(HAS_BIARCH),y)
 |AS              := $(AS) -a32
 |LD              := $(LD) -m elf32ppc
 |CC              := $(CC) -m32
 |endif
David wrote and showed a testcase.
Adding $(strip ) wrapper helped with this, but may screw many other
things. Maybe you will help, unless Linus will finally revert this :)
