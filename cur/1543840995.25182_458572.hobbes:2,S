And reported in the manpage of mdadm to be usable (simply specify "missing"

That is what I also thought. But there are some points that make me
wonder:
   a) why is hdk1 marked as spare? I added it this morning and the
   rebuilt began. Though something happened (I do not know what)
   and made hdk1 not beeing in the array. (dmesg output
   is now available at
   
http://home.schottelius.org/~nico/linux/debug/raid/raid5.strange.dmesg
)
   b) what's the reason, linux does not mark md2 as faulty?

I expected hdk1 and md1 to work.

That's clear.

Will linux detect, that md1 and hde1 are from the same array
and will it see which harddisk is xored with which one?
Perhaps this is the only way to go. I hope I did not loose too much
data with my 'moving to raid5'-experiement.
Thanks for the suggestions so far!
