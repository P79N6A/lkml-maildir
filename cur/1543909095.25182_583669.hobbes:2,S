Well, omit 'think' and the answer may be "yes". A lot of systems are quite 
simple and RAID is common on the desktop now. If jostled USB fits into this 
category - then "yes".

And that's the key isn't it. We have the RAID device UUID and the superblock 
info. Isn't that enough? If not then given the work involved an extended 
superblock wouldn't be unreasonable.
And I suspect the capability of devices would need recording in the superblock 
too? eg 'retry-on-fail'
I can see how md would fail a device but may now periodically retry it. If a 
retry shows that it's back then it would validate it (UUID) and then resync it.

I do agree - I was looking for value-add for the existing subsystem. If this 
benefits existing RAID users then it's more likely to be attractive.
