well this is pretty useful.  just curious--which gcc are you using to
build your kernels?  i have slightly different assembly for this bit
of code but it seems to point to:
Line 657 of "net/atm/lec.c" starts at address 0xe4a <lec_push+26> and ends at 0xe50 <lec_push+32>.
which is:
void
lec_push(struct atm_vcc *vcc, struct sk_buff *skb)
{
        struct net_device *dev = (struct net_device *)vcc->proto_data;
        struct lec_priv *priv = (struct lec_priv *)dev->priv;		<=====
%edx holds the result of vcc->proto_data (or dev) which seems to be 0.
this is bad.  since you died in an interrupt handler, it a fairly 
safe guess that this is a race.  a quick check of where proto_data gets
assigned shows:
lec_vcc_attach(struct atm_vcc *vcc, void *arg)
{
	...
        vcc->push = lec_push;
        vcc->proto_data = dev_lec[ioc_data.dev_num];
	...
this is bad.  these two lines should be reversed!  lec_push() is
not safe until vcc->proto_data is setup.  could you swap the order of
those two lines and give that a try?
