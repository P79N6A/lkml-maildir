There are other network devices that do not claim 
PCI_CLASS_NETWORK_ETHERNET either.  Since this is a purely cosmetic 
issue -- said userland tools would need to support weird cases _anyway_ 
  -- I am not inclined to apply the patch.
The kernel could do a lot to make things "prettier," but that would lead 
to lots of additional code bloat.  It's easier to export the world as it 
is, and let the chips fall where they may.
