No, it does not work. It did not lowercased your filenames even when
it should. If you had 'NCP' in ASCII instead of CP866, it was lowercased
on 2.2.13, but if it had 'NCP' in CP866, it was not lowercased... So
when mixing latin and azbuka you could get 'nCp' - that's wrong. If
you do not want DOS created filenames to be lowercased, do not select it.
(BTW, you can see it on file 'SEMENOV.doc' in 2.2.13 picture - '.doc'
was lowercased, but SEMENOV (CEMEHOB) was not...)

NLS16 screwed 2.2.16 NCP. I sent patch to Urban and Alan, but it looks
like that 2.2.17-pre13 still has not it fixed.

No. You did not do 'ls -l'... Of course that filenames are lowercased -
- it is intentional. But your bash listing does not show whether Linux
thinks that files are files or that they are directories...

Yes.

No. See CEMEHOB.doc on your picture.

No. If you do 'nwdir -v' in that directory, you'll see that some files
have DOS as owning namespace, some have OS/2 (and maybe some have NFS
(though if you had NFS namespace, ncpfs will use this and will not
do any case plays as NFS is case sensitive).
Only filenames created by DOS are lowercased, because of, for your
convience when moving from DOS namespace to OS/2 namespace, you want
to still see lowercased filenames as you saw before you added OS/2
namespace to volume.

Yes, 2.2.16 is broken.

What? I looked at bash-2.4.0-upper and bash-2.4.0 and I see that all
characters were correctly uppercased, if entry had to be uppercased.
Where letter was damaged by uppercasing?

Yes. Urban (I believe that Urban... if not, sorry) by accident
passed always zero as high unicode byte into unicode translation,
so it worked for iso-8859-1 only...
Go to linux/fs/ncpfs/ncplib_kernel.h and replace (twice) first
parameter to nls_out->uni2char(0x00, uc.uni2, .....) with
nls_out->uni2char(uc.uni1, uc.uni2, .....). Then you'll get same
behavior which 2.4.0 has. Which is IMHO correct behavior.
If you are using case-insensitive namespace (OS/2) and your
server can open 'NCP', but cannot open 'ncp', your server
is broken, isn't it?
