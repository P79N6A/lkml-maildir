Good for you.

Sounds handy.

Several times I've been at the point of responding to your posts, but
decided I couldn't be bothered with the effort. But now I really am
getting tired of your behaviour. I don't know what your problem is.
Larry didn't put forth his idea and proclaim he was being visionary.
He just put his idea out there and said it would be cool. You then
started mounting repeated assults where you've claimed that "it can't
be done", that it's a silly idea, that he (and others) don't know what
they're talking about, and picking nits.
Now you turn around and state that you've done this two years ago. So
what's it going to be? Is it a good idea or not? And no, I don't want
feeble explanations of how some subtle detail of Larry's idea is
different and flawed. That won't wash. You've lashed out at Larry and
others, making it clear from the content and tone of your posts that
his whole idea was absurd.
You've also come out with this obnoxious rubbish about other people's
egos, incompetence, lack of experience in the industry and so on.
Without actually shouting, swearing or being overtly rude, you
nevertheless have been offensive in your tone and dished out subtle
insults.
Given that you have recently posted a pious message about conduct on
this list, I find it quite hypocritical for you to conduct what
amounts to a flamewar in disguise. I think you need to take a look in
a mirror and consider your own behaviour. It looks to me that you're
the one with the bruised ego, perhaps because someone had the temerity
of independently proposing your idea, or perhaps because someone
suggested something nhot exactly the same.
If you wanted to be constructive rather than aggressive, your *first*
response to Larry's original message would have been to mention what
you did two years ago. If that would have been followed by your views
on the pros and cons of your scheme compared to Larry's, that would
have been doubly interesting.
But no, your first post was to riducule the idea. What a waste of
bandwidth.

Charming. Be offensive, and then ask that people not be offended. How
about not being offensive in the first place?
And as for laughing... I'm sure there is some laughing going on right
now, but I don't think it's Larry laughing at himself... I think
people are laughing with him, not at him.
