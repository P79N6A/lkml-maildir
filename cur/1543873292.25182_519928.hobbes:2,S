hm. Do you have any numbers handy - what is the end-result of your 
unification work, how many lines of code were unified, compared to the 
total body of code in i386 and x86_64?

yeah, that #include file thing for early_printk.c is just gross.

symbolic links perhaps? In that case i'd also introduce a common naming 
scheme: x86_early_printk.c - to make sure we know it right away that 
those files are bi-arch.
