Here's the second, and this is much more critical.
And it's untested.
And it's a temp-fix - it'll be addressed by other means in 2.6.12.

From: Dmitry Torokhov <dtor_core@ameritech.net>
Some ACPI-related changes were recently made to i8042 discovery for ia64. 
Unfortunately this broke a significant number of Dell laptops due to their
having incorrect BIOS tables.
So, for now, arrange for the new code to be ia64-only.
