Hello,
Last night I experienced total system lockup when I added second NIC to
bond0 group, no OOPS or anything, system stopped to respond immediatiately.
I had system running about 30 minutes with only one slave for bond0 before
I did "ifenslave bond0 eth1" which then resulted the lockup. I haven't had
yet time to test this again but I had bonding running with same config on
2.4.20.
System is a Dell PowerEdge 2600 with two Intel PRO/1000 NIC's.
