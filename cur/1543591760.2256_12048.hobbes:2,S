This seems a bit too strong.  If I try to exec a file that has read
permission enabled but not execute permission, I'd like this to fail.
You can just imagine sysadmins who turn off exec bits on old buggy apps
to prevent users from executing them, who could get bit in the butt by
the sort of unexpected behavior that would result from ignoring execute
permission bits.
