Is there any particular reason why the POSIX semantics are desirable
(besides "that's the way POSIX says it should be")?
Personally, I can think of no benenfit to per-process uids/gids, and
several scenarios where per-thread uids/gids would be good. (Think of a
multi-threaded server handling connections from N different users on N
threads, or a 1 thread per CPU server handling many different user
connections, or a multi-threaded web server running perl/php/etc. stuff
as different users in different threads.)
Just wondering, Nicholas.
