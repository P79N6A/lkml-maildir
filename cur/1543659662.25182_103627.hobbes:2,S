The following program shows why it's not "safe" to do anything
with argv[0].
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int c, char *argv[], char *env[])
{
   int i;
   i = 0;
   printf("Stack is at %p\n", &i);
   while(argv[i])
   {
       printf("Pointer at %p = %s\n", argv[i], argv[i]);
       i++; 
   }
   i = 0;
   while(env[i])
   {
       printf("Pointer at %p = %s\n", env[i], env[i]);
       i++; 
   }
   return 0;
}
Everything is lined-up, sitting on the stack, and all variable-
length.
I looked at sendmail and it just does:
	strcpy(argv[0] ,"sendmail:accepting connections");
But sendmail doesn't use the environment so if it gets trashed
it doesn't make any difference. It looks as though, if the
environment was small, i.e., only "TERM=vt100", sendmail might
have problems if main() ever returns to _start. The stack
will be trashed. But, most 'C' code doesn't do "return N;" from
main, certainly not a daemon, most call exit().
Anyway, overwriting argv[0] is done, but it's not "safe".

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
