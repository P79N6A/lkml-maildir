Well, we agree. As Richard Henderson just pointed out, parisc
is among those that can't load large immediate values either.

Of those suggested, arm_ffs() is closest to what parisc
currently has in assembly (see include/asm-parisc/bitops.h:__ffs()).
But given how unobvious the parisc instruction nullification works,
the rough equivalent in "C" (untested!) would look something like:
	unsigned int k = 31;
	if (word & 0x0000ffff) { k -= 16;} else { word >>= 16; }
	if (word & 0x000000ff) { k -=  8;} else { word >>= 8; }
	if (word & 0x0000000f) { k -=  4;} else { word >>= 4; }
	if (word & 0x00000003) { k -=  2;} else { word >>= 2; }
	if (word & 0x00000001) { k -=  1;}
	return k;
I doubt that's better for arm but am curious how it compares.
You have time to try it?
If not, no worries.

Yeah, about the same for parisc.

Agreed. But I expect parisc will have to continue using it's asm
sequence and ignore the generic version. AFAIK, the compiler isn't that
good with instruction nullification and I have other issues I'd
rather work on.
