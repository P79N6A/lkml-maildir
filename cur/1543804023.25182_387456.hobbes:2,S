When the above command is executed gcc is actually called two times due
to following lines:
scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/Makefile
HOST_EXTRACFLAGS:= $(shell $(CONFIG_SHELL) $(check-lxdialog) -ccflags)
HOST_LOADLIBES  := $(shell $(CONFIG_SHELL) $(check-lxdialog) -ldflags $(HOSTCC))
The shell script check-dialog.sh is called which again do:
echo "main() {}" | gcc -xc - -o /dev/null
And it seems that gcc will trash /dev/null in your setup when doing
this.
One fix would be to avoid the two lines during distclean,
but I may have to resort to a temporary file.
Could you please confirm that the above command is the one that trashes
/dev/null, then I will try to cook up something better.
