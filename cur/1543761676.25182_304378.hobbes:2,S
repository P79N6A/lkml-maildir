Hello again,
The KBUILD_MODNAME problem with af_unix.c is sort of also affecting
the ide code, but with another twist. "unix" is not a problem, but
KBUILD_MODNAME collides with constants defined in <linux/ide.h>:
[snip]
/*
 * Now for the data we need to maintain per-drive:  ide_drive_t
 */
#define ide_scsi	0x21
#define ide_disk	0x20
#define ide_optical	0x7
#define ide_cdrom	0x5
#define ide_tape	0x1
#define ide_floppy	0x0
[snip]
this results in wierd KBUILD_MODNAME preprocessing:
- KBUILD_MODNAME in ide-disk.c equals "0x20"
- KBUILD_MODNAME in ide-tape.c equals "0x1"
- KBUILD_MODNAME in ide-floppy.c equals "0x0"
Why again are we using lowercase constants?
