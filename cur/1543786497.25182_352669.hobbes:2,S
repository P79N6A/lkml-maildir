I'm using 2.6.13-mm1, and i tried both 1.0.6 and the included driver 
(both matched with the appropriate ieee80211 driver) and I'm using 
debian unstable's version of hotplug Version: 0.0.20031013-2.   I have 
very little installed on this computer as it's a WRAP board with mini 
pci intel 2915.  Is anything in userspace required to load firmware 
besides hotplug? I dont use udev or devfs ...not sure if there are /dev 
entries or what. 
I'm getting this error constantly (thousands of times a second when 
modprobing the ipw2200 driver (any version)
firmware_loading_store: unexpected value (0)
I have the firmware available in every possible accepted location for 
firmware.   I have no doubt that it's finding the firmware, but unable 
to load it.  My sysfs driver directory for the pci device has no "data" 
file/directory in it, which I thought is where firmware is loaded. 
If any other info is required to figure this problem out.  Just mention 
it.  I'll provide everything.  Attached is my config for the kernel in 
question.
