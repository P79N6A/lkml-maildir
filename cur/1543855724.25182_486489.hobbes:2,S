I use this patch with 2.6.18.3.
patching: ok
configuring: ok
compiling: ok
installing: ok
running: ok
tested with httpd, smbd, nmbd, named, cupsd, ping, traceroute,
modprobe, traceroute, ntpdate, xinit, killall, eject, dhcpd, route,
qemu: ok
I use this patch as documented: 
http://www.friedhoff.org/fscaps.html
I also tested the patched kernel with "CONFIG_SECURITY_FS_CAPABILITIES
is not set" and xinit kills X perfectly, when the GUI is stopped.
Any other tests that might be helpful?
The webpage is updated.
