Here's an end-user perspective for you... I just spent 2 days trying to 
figure out how to use my CD-RW drive to read when using ide-scsi, before 
I finnaly realized that I had to do it by disabling ATAPI CD support and 
enabling SCSI CD support..
This is a severe inconvienience to the end-user who doesn't know what the 
problem is, esspecialy since I only found the answer to the problem in a 
couple places, I had to go through a ton of google search results to find 
anything.
