This is a bug in the proc/net/tcp openreq printing code. It happens when 
the application does not call accept() in time, then the pending accepts
will be printed as SYN_RECV still although they are already established.
This patch should fix the printing, of course it doesn't fix the application
to call accept in time.
BTW, don't trust the SYN_RECV listing code too much, it might miss some sockets
when the socket listing is longer than PAGE_SIZE.
