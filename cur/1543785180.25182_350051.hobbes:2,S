look at the bottom of scsi_prep_fn() in scsi_lib.c. SCSI-ml will do 
block_pc commands (which come down like block layer SG_IO ones) for 
things like inquiry and report luns when scanning a host. At that time 
there is no upper layer driver like sd attached so scsi_generic_done() 
is used as a callback for finishing up commands.
