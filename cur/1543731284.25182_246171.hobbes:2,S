Okay, let's start a review for the actual files based on that
all files: lots of missing statics, try running
http://samba.org/ftp/unpacked/junkcode/findstatic.pl
 over the compiled code.
io_init.c:
 - sal_get_hubdev_info
	umm, you're getting a kernel pointer by a SAL
 	call.  I wonders how this is supposed to work when the kernel
	changes it's VA layout.  (Dito for a bunch of other functions)
 - sn_io_init
	what's going on here?
iomv.c:
 - okay, could use some reformatting to fit 80 chars
pci_dma.c:
 - still using all those indirections althoug there's only a single backend
pci_extension.c:
 - dito.  Why does this single function need a separate file?
pcibr_ate.c:
 - doesn't look to bad, but should probably merged into pcibr_dma.c.  And
   the trivial < 10 line function opencoded in their only callers.
pcibr_dma.c:
 - okay
pcibr_provider.c
 actual code code looks okay, but:
  - sal_pcibr_slot_enable/sal_pcibr_slot_disabl are completely unused
  - the pci_provider abstraction is right now completely useless, please
    add such abstractions only when you need them (and if you'll ever need
    that a few hints:  stop that casting of methods silliness but use
    container_of, use C99 initializers, stop the typedef abuse)
  - request_irq return value needs checking
pcibr_reg.c:
 - all this casting is rather horrible.  At least keep a pointer to each
   of struct tiocp and pic_s (and kill the _s postifx) in syruct pcibus_info.
   the volatiles looks bogus, if you need it you're missing memorry barries.
xtalk_providers.c:
 - bogus indirection again.  if you actually do have different lowlevel
   implementations they should be hidden inside the prom.  While at it I think
   the two calls could just move to arch/ia64/sn/kernel/irq.c
