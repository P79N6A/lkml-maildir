Hm.  Certainly a non-one-instruction access would be considerably less
useful than one that is, because of preemption issues.
(In general you need to pin yourself to a cpu if you're using percpu
data, but sometimes it doesn't matter.  In particular, the reason I'm
interested in this at all is because Xen puts its interrupt mask flag in
per-cpu data, and a single instruction means that masking interrupts
[=disable preemption] can be done in one instruction with no scope for
preemption in the middle doing something unexpected.)

Hm, yes, I see.  Dratted large address space.  What's wrong with 4G
anyway? ;)
Anyway, I can see the problem with my thinking about this so far.
