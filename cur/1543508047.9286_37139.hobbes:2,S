Actually, with LVM it's not as impossible as it sounds.  On AIX, and
presumably in future Linux LVM, you can have your filesystems mirrored
across different adapters, and even different kinds of disks (eg IDE,
SCSI, SSA, etc).  You can already boot Linux LVM to have all of your
filesystems using LVM.  If you were to "unmirror" from the boot device,
there might be nothing using that disk anymore, and you should be able to
safely remove and update the driver for this device...  No fuss, no mess,
no need for extra code in the kernel...
Cheers, Andreas
