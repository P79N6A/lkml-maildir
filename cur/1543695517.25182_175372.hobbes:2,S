netdev@oss.sgi.com doesn't have an official webpage anywhere
to tell you that it even exists. No info on how to subscribe
or what the rules of the list are.
On 
http://oss.sgi.com/
 the netdev list is not mentioned at all.
I can't find a mailinglist archive of netdev.
I'd like to read netdev but I'm not sure to subscribe since
as I said info on it is basically non-existing.
Perhaps SGI could create a "netdev" page somewhere on
oss.sgi.com, link to it from "projects lists" or "newsgroups
and mailinglists", and resurrect the archive ? Please ?
Mike.
