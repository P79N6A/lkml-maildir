and the amount of time spent executing on the CPU was only 70 msecs! So 
we spent 99% of that 7.9 seconds with just waiting around. Here are the 
top 10 sleep reasons:
    864  schedule()<-schedule_timeout()<-ps2_sendbyte()<-ps2_command()
    183  schedule()<-vt_waitactive()<-vt_ioctl()<-tty_ioctl()
    164  schedule()<-schedule_timeout()<-acpi_ec_wait()<-acpi_ec_transaction()
    157  schedule()<-refrigerator()<-get_signal_to_deliver()<-do_notify_resume()    
    118  schedule()<-worker_thread()<-kthread()<-kernel_thread_helper()
     80  schedule()<-do_msleep()<-msleep()<-sata_link_debounce()
     64  schedule()<-schedule_timeout()<-inet_csk_accept()<-inet_accept()
     37  schedule()<-__mutex_lock_slowpath()<-mutex_lock()<-acpi_ec_transaction()
     20  schedule()<-schedule_timeout()<-do_select()<-core_sys_select()
     20  schedule()<-io_schedule()<-sync_buffer()<-__wait_on_bit()
what's weird are all those ps2 related sleeps - they make up for much of 
the delay. This how such a sleep point looks like:
    bash 3500  0D... 8641415us : schedule()<-schedule_timeout()<-ps2_sendbyte()<-ps2_command()
    bash 3500  0D... 8641417us : psmouse_sliced_command()<-synaptics_pt_write()<-ps2_sendbyte()<-ps2_command()
it starts somewhere here:
    bash 3500  0.... 5302376us : serio_reconnect_driver (serio_resume)
and ends:
 kseriod 208   0D... 9182560us : synaptics_query_hardware()<-synaptics_reconnect()<-psmouse_reconnect()<-serio_reconnect_driver()
so this section (serio_resume()) took almost 4 seconds.
the main delay seems to be dpm_resume():
    bash 3500  0.N.. 3061040us : dpm_resume (device_resume)
...
    bash 3500  0.... 9105017us : mutex_unlock (dpm_resume)
    bash 3500  0.... 9105018us : mutex_unlock (device_resume)
6.1 seconds!
