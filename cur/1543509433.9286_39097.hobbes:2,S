You don't normally want to use threads for processing unless there is a high
overhead in the processing work. Linux is really designed to do the work on
the IRQ while the cache is still hot with the data you just acquired.
If the processing isnt a tiny period you'd probably use a bottom half - The
network layer for example grabs and queues packets on interrupt and processes
them on the bh.
