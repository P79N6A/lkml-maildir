I was not aware of that. Would it be possible for you to summarize all the 
test data that you have right now about SLUB vs. SLAB with the patches 
listed? Exactly what kernel version and what version of the per cpu 
patches were tested? Was the page allocator pass through patchset 
separately applied as I requested?
Finally: Is there some way that I can reproduce the tests on my machines?
