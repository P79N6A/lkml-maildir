It needs a little refinement methinks:
  ether1.c: ether1_readbuffer (
  ether3.c: ether3_readbuffer(
These are OK.

  am79c961a.c: am_readword (
  am79c961a.c: am_readbuffer(
> linux-2.3.33/drivers/video/cyber2000fb.h
heh, this one I like!
  cyber2000fb.h: #define cyber2000_inb(reg)      readb(CyberRegs + reg)
  cyber2000fb.c: CyberRegs = ioremap(mmio_base, MMIO_SIZE);
Ok, so it's not possible for a script to work out everything, but I
think there's a little bit of room for improvement for the first three.
Maybe you want to search using a regular expression like:
	'read[bwl] *\('
or maybe even:
	'read[bwl][ \t]*\('
Hope this helps.
