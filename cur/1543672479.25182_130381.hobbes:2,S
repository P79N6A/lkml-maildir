 Does this pseudocode look like it would work?  It should make it
only complain if two or more interrupts in a row go unhandled.
int last_irq_was_dropped[NR_IRQS];
/* call each handler in turn for this irq */
for (each_driver(irq)) {
        ret = call_driver();
        if (ret == irq_handled) {
                if (unlikely(last_irq_was_dropped[irq])
                        last_irq_was_dropped[irq] = 0;
                break;
        }
}
if (ret != irq_handled) {
        if (unlikely(last_irq_was_dropped[irq]))
                complain();
        else
                last_irq_was_dropped[irq] = 1;
}
