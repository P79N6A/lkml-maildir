Subject: Reserving "special" port numbers in the kernel ?

One of the Intel server platforms has a magic port number (623) that
it uses for remote server management. However, neither the kernel nor
glibc are aware of this special port.
As a result, when someone requests a privileged port using
bindresvport(3), they may get this port back and bad things happen.
Has anyone run into this or similar problems before ? Thoughts on
what's the right place to handle this issue ?
