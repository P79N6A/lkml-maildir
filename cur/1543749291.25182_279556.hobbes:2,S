This requires writing the plugin to have explicit caching of output.  It

My solution is to tell Nate Diller that there is extensive literature on 
it, that it isn't really the big problem it is made out to be, and leave 
it to him to go read the literature and code it up after he finishes the 
required tasks of our current darpa contract.;-)
