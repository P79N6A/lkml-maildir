Subject: filldir() change broke my CFS -- any ideas?

	Hi;
	CFS is a user space cryptographic filesystem that is
implemented by a daemon that acts as an nfs server.
	In 2.4.9-pre1 a little patch promoted the type of one of
the arguments to filldir from off_t to loff_t. (patch included
below). This has the effect of breaking directory listings for
CFS: I can only see the first 63 files in a dir. In order to
access the other files, I must delete some from the pool of 63.
	I have watched the routine in cfsd that gets called to
deliver the directories back to the client via whatever rpc
magic, and it looks like its doing the same thing with or without
this patch. (this routine gets called multiple times, until
all files have been read via readdir(3)-- 63 just happens to be
the number that fits in the buffer constraints for an
invocation-- and the 63 files I see are from the first
invocation.)
	I rebuilt glibc against 2.4.18 kernel headers, then
nfs-utils, then cfsd, but still the broken behaviour.
I dont know where the breakage is occuring, and would appreciate
any insight, while I continue to poke at this...
Thanks;
Paul
