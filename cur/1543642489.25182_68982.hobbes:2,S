I am new to Linux (but not kernel development) and am developing a
kernel-mode driver
that needs to read/write a raw disk device.  I have been unable to find a
way to map a
kernel buffer for use with block_read() and/or block_write().
Are there alternate calls to block_read/write that will allow use of a
kernel-mode buffer,
or can it be done with MMAP?  I am considering a temp hack of having a user
process
do an OPEN on my device and pass a user-space buffer to me for my use.  Note
that
the driver does NOT use the normal driver interface, but is an autonomous
driver.
Thanks for any help!
