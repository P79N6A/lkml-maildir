Actually, query if it drops priviledges before it does anything bad is
probably equivalent to halting problem ;). You could go for programs
carrying proof that they are safe. I don't think that's a way.

You really need at least to be able to query. If I see /bin/ping, I
want to know what permissions it runs with! And ability to set is also
usefull, that way I can take stock Debian 2.1 install and make it
capability-enhanced in 5 minutes.

I'd like capabilities masks to be normally set at compile time, in the
long term. But it *must* be possible to list this, and it would be
nice to be able to change capability masks in future.
Yes, I see it is hard to get masks right. That's why I started
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/caps/capbase.html;
 take a look
and correct any mistakes you see. I'd like all authors of secure
programs to add their entries; really only they have knowledge for
nontrivial cases. That's why I started database.
I even have script which looks which executables are configured
insecurely (
http://atrey/~pavel/caps/capcheck
) (which might actually
configure them in future) -- this is as userfriendly as you can get
it.

That's hard part, because this way dynamic linker + anything run
before main() runs with elevated priviledges. That's problem, at least
for me.
But imagine me going after author of sendmail and asking for
#ifdef LINUX
	capabilities_drop( -1 & (~CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE))
#endif
. I think he would kill me.
