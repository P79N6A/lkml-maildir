Every time i try to use eth1 which is r8169, i get a kernel panic, but
on the actual use of it, not the configuring it.
e.g.
laptop ~ # ifconfig eth1 up 192.168.1.1
laptop ~ # ping 192.168.1.2
PING 192.168.1.2 (192.168.1.2) 56(84) bytes of data.

 <0>Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
I never had time to write down the whole stack trace (and there was no
core file created)
This driver used to work in a previous kernel version (but it did get
IRQ #x nobody cared messages, usually when there was some sort of a
disconnection of my ethernet cable for whatever reason). This is
always reproducable.
uname -a:
Linux laptop 2.6.11-rc1-mm1 #2 SMP Sun Jan 16 22:36:26 GMT 2005 i686
Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.80GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
I would try a newer kernel, but the command line options for
specifying the framebuffer settings seems to have changed in the
latest kernel and i haven't had enough time to work out how to specify
it.
