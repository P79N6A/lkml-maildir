according to my observation 2.6.19-rt15 is based/includes 2.6.19.1 changes.
But there has been that nasty clear_page_dirty_for_io() bug causing
corruption of ext3. Even that I have tested more 2.6.20-rc + rt, I preffer
to stay on "stable" kernel on boxes which I use daily until next stable
appears. I have backported clear_page_dirty_for_io() to 2.6.19-rt15
and it worked fine. I have tried to update 2.6.19-rt15 to 2.6.19.2
base. There is result of my attempt
Unofficial incremental patch from 2.6.19-rt15 to 2.6.19.2 + rt
http://rtime.felk.cvut.cz/repos/ppisa-linux-devel/kernel-patches/current/patch-2.6.19.2-incr.patch
Kernel seems to work correctly. I have checked the patch contents
and I have not noticed any RT problematic changes in the code according
to my dumb knowledge.
I would be very happy, if Ingo would be so kind and could confirm my findings,
because I am not sure, if final 2.6.20+rt would be ready before we need
to prepare setup for our next semester classes at university.
Best wishes
