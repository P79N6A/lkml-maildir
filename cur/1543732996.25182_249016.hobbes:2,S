Well, basically if you want to have a chance to do any io scheduling
anywhere, you need to have more than 1 request to play with really. And
if the drive is swallowing all your requests all the time, you are
screwed. I do think the best option (as some people mentioned in this
thread) is to limit the 3ware queue depth, not increase the io scheduler
depth. At least for most of the current io schedulers, this will kill
your latency quite a bit.

Yes, if you want to do this, we need to export a function to do it that
takes care of updating the block layer congestion (etc) data.

Indeed.

Great!
