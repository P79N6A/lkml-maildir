People seem to have a blind spot for this sort of thing.  Given *two* processes,
one of which can be convinced to do a rename, and another that can be convinced
to write a file, you can subvert everything (quite possibly in opposite order -
if you can get process A to write /etc/foobar, and process B to rename foobar
to passwd, you've won).
Those who think that 2 processes can't be subverted should consider that symlink
attacks have been around for a quarter of a century - and in that time, it's
*always* been "one process to create the symlink, another to follow it to disaster".
