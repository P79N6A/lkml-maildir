Two separate oopses this morning running that above patch. One appears 
to happen in locks_delete_lock. The log output follows. Unfortunately I 
am not sure what is relevant to the oops and whats not so I am sending 
it all. Also the trace that was generated when this happened can be 
found here:

log output:

The other appears to happen in __posix_lock_file.

log output here:

If there is anything else that I can provide on these, or if there is a 
better way to post this, please let me know.
