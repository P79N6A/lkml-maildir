msecs_to_jiffies (kernel/time.c) has this:
#if HZ <= MSEC_PER_SEC && !(MSEC_PER_SEC % HZ)
	/*
	 * HZ is equal to or smaller than 1000, and 1000 is a nice
	 * round multiple of HZ, divide with the factor between them,
	 * but round upwards:
	 */
	return (m + (MSEC_PER_SEC / HZ) - 1) / (MSEC_PER_SEC / HZ);
With HZ=250 and m=4 this gives 7/4 or only 1 jiffy, which is not more 
than 4ms, but if we are already at near the end of the current jiffy it 
could be much less than that (potentially almost no time at all).
Maybe we could convert poll to use a hrtimer for this instead?
