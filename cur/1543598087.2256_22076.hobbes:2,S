Clearing memory on most machines takes a 1s or less.  Think of memory
fill rates at the 800MB/s level.  Most BIOS's seem to clear some of
the memory but I haven't read their code to see what they are doing.

Correct.

This would totally depend on your controller.  But different timings
shouldn't affect your memory cells just the read/write paths to your
memory.

Hmm.  That sounds a little risky.  I have measured single bit errors
occuring as early as 1s after writing the data without somekind of
refresh running.

Comments frequently don't match the code.  And how the SDRAM controller
must be initialized totally depends on the chipset and vendor.  SDRAM
itself must be initialized in a specific matter.  
But for the case of a warm reset there is not need to reset the SDRAM
controller.  Memory really only needs to be cleared in the case when
some form of error checking is being used.
Personally I think writing such code carries more credibility then
simply posting it anyway....
