I posted a trivial hack with pointed possible errors and a question
about should it be further extended (and race fixed by any of the
possible methods and so on) or new one should be developed (like in your
approach when only high level device is charged), instead I got replies
that it contains bugs, whcih will stop system and kill gene pool of the
mankind. I know how it works and where problems are. And if we are going
with this approach I will fix pointed issues.

Yes, it should.

We still did not come to the conclusion, but I do not want to start a
flamewar, you believe that throttling must be done on the top level
device, so you need to extend bio and convince others that idea worth
it.

Block layer does not know and should not be bothered with underlying
device nature - if you think that in endio callback limit should not be
rechardged, then provide your own layer on top of bio and thus call
endio callback only when you think it is ready to be completed.
