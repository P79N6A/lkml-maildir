It'd be weird if you're not weird.

The /sys/debug knob depends upon CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG, I assume?
umm, yes, I do think that it would be prudent to make this control
unconditionally available.  Experience tells us that any regressions
which this change causes could take a long time to turn up - sometimes
years.  By which time the people who are reporting the regressions are
running packaged kernels, and if that packaged kernel didn't enable
CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG, we're a bit screwed.
Did we end up deciding to remove the CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES=n dependency?
