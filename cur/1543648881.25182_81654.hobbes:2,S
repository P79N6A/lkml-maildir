You don't need to "use the fd until EAGAIN", you can consume even only
byte out of 10000 and stop using the fd. As long as you keep such fd in
your ready-list. As soon as you receive an EAGAIN from that fd, you remove
it from your ready-list and the next time you'll go to fish for events it
will reemerge as soon as it'll have something for you. The concept is very
simple, "you don't have to go waiting for events for a given fd before
having consumed its I/O space".
