i've uploaded the -P4 patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.8.1-P4
the main change is a more robust latency tracer - the previous one was
not 100% correct for interrupts. People who have exprienced those weird
~1msec latencies in the idle task please re-check and re-post latency
traces.
Changes since -P3:
 - changed SHA_CODE_SIZE from 0 to 3 to reduce RNG overhead
 - fixed the copy_page_range latency
 - improved the latency tracer
