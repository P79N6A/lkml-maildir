Hi,
	thanks for your advice.  Adding debug produced one other message in
the Kernel log:
IRQ for 00:0a.0:0 -> PIRQ 03, mask deb8, excl 0e20 -> newirq=9 -> got IRQ 10
IRQ routing conflict for 00:0a.0, have irq 9, want irq 10
I think my testing shows that actual irq's assigned are as indicated by the
"have irq" field.  And that as far as I can tell at the moment everything
seems to work OK.
Regards
Kevin

This means that config space (supposedly set up by the BIOS) reports IRQ 9 
for the device, but the IRQ router really routes it to IRQ 5.

Well, the kernel currently ignores its knowledge about the router and 
trusts the BIOS. Which most likely means that the IRQ won't work.
(Note that in general you should access dev->irq only after calling 
pci_enable_device())

#define DEBUG
in arch/i386/kernel/pci-i386.h will give some debugging output on the next 
boot, which should help.
