Crazy idea, indeed. spinlocks are like safety belts: You should
actually not need them in the normal case, but they will save your butt
and you'll be glad you have them, when they actually trigger.
So if you are making serious progress here, you have just uncovered
a spinlockcontention problem in the kernel ;-)
