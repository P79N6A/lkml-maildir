Ouch.  The .c files should generally be built into their own .o files and
then the Makefile should do something like
obj-$(CONFIG_SYAORAN) += syaoran.o
unless there's *really* good reasons for including .c files (such as an
otherwise-messy variable-namespace issue or similar).
Also, has this been double-checked to Do The Right Thing if you have
*two* instances of ramfs mounted, one with Syaoran and one without?  I don't
know the code well enough to know if you found *all* the places you need
something like:

(incidentally, all of these should probably be abstracted into a helper
function that's 'static inline' so we have just one #ifdef in the definition
in a .h file, and none in open .c code).
Similarly for other places you have #ifdef CONFIG_ in ramfs .c code - see if
you can abstract it out.

Question for the audience: *should* ramfs set that field so setattr works
on ramfs (even if it's just a stub similar to the SELinux fscontext= mount
stuff)?
Question for Tetsuo:  What happens to this code if somebody actually does the
above change?

This should say "will always get", not "can always", as this code will

The format of this file needs to be documented.  I'm not terribly thrilled by
the idea of passing a file to be read by the kernel, but I also understand
that if it isn't done before mount, you have a race condition betweet the
mount and the load.  Perhaps write some configfs code so that you can
'mount /configfs; cat config.file > /configfs/syaoran; mount -t syaoran"?
Similarly, it looks like you create your debug files inside the ramfs - that
is probably a bad idea and possibly can exhaust resources.  Convert it to
use debugfs instead?

Does this (and the code right after Do The Right Thing if somebody does this:
mount -t syaoran -o noatime,noexec /some/path
(I admit not knowing if mount options common to all mounts are stripped out
by the VFS code or passed down to this code).
Or even worse, "-o noatime,accept=/some/path/ramfs.cfg"?

Does this do what you think it does if run in a chroot process or if
some creative person does "accept=../../path/to/bad_data.cfg"?
That printk should be KERN_ERR, I think.
That's all that's immediately obvious to me - somebody who actually understands
the filesystem code better will probably need to review it for all the stuff
I missed before it can be included.
