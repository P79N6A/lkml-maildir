Hi,
    Add the following line in the /etc/rc.d/init.d/network script at the end
of "start" case:
    /sbin/route add default gw <whatever is your default getway ip address>
    OR
    You can modify the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth* to add a
line as
    GW=<whatever is your default getway ip address>
    and modify the /etc/rc.d/init.d/network script if statement at the end of
"start" case. For example, here are few lines of what I've done in my script:
        # Add non interface-specific static-routes.
        if [ -f /etc/sysconfig/static-routes ]; then
           grep "^any" /etc/sysconfig/static-routes | while read ignore type
dest netmask mask gw gateway; do
              [ "${gateway}" != "${gateway##[0-9}" ] && \
                /sbin/route add -$type $dest $netmask $mask $gw $gateway
           done
        fi
        touch /var/lock/subsys/network
        ;;
best of luck!
