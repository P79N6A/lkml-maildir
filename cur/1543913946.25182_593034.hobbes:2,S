This means that MTD did not return an error when the test tried to read
the last NAND page's OOB. Here is the code:
/* Attempt to write off end of device */
ops.mode      = MTD_OOB_AUTO;
ops.ooblen    = mtd->ecclayout->oobavail + 1;
ops.oobbuf    = writebuf;
printk(PRINT_PREF "Attempting to write past end of device\n");
printk(PRINT_PREF "An error is expected...\n");
err = mtd->write_oob(mtd, mtd->size - mtd->writesize, &ops);
So we read OOB size + 1 byte from the last NAND page and get no error.
This test passes for nandsim, so I'm not sure the problem is in the
generic code. On the other hand, it is generic code which should check
rages.

Similar.

We are planning to clean up the tests and submit them for kernel
inclusion some day, when we have time.
