__sync_single_inode
We do have I_WILL_FREE, but i_count will be zero.

nr_unused doesn't seem to count the number of inodes on the unused list.
It is actually counting the number of inodes whose i_count is 0.  See
generic_forget_inode and invalidate_list to see what I mean.
generic_forget_inode took care of incrementing the unused count when
i_count went to zero. So, I don't think we need to worry about the
unused count in __writeback_single_inode.
