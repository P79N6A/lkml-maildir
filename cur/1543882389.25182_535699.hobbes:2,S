Subject: MAINTAINERS file out of date?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi folks,
I noticed the MAINTAINERS file still lists Riley Williams as the 
maintainer of the i386 boot code, presumably as no-one else has taken it 
up in his absence (though, I'm sure it's probably been touched since 
late 2004).
If I knew the first thing about the i386 boot process I would volunteer, 
but sadly I don't....
This article below details the reason for his absence, but please make 
sure you're sitting down before clicking. (It is work-safe.)

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
