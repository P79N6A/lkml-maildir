I suspect the old "rep scas" has always been slower than 
compiler-generated code, at least under your test conditions. Many of the 
old asm's are actually _very_ old, and some of them come from pre-0.01 
days and are more about me learning the i386 (and gcc inline asm).
That said, I don't much like your benchmarking methodology. I suspect that 
quite often, the code in question runs from L2 cache, not in a tight loop, 
and so that "run a million times" approach is not necessarily the best 
one.
I'll apply this one as obvious: I doubt the compiler generates bigger code
or has any real downsides, but I just wanted to say that in general I just
wish people didn't always time the hot-cache case ;)
