Hi, 
I've been doing some benchmarks with this board, it is terribly disppointing. 
Has anyone had similar experiences?
The hardware spec is:
Dual 2.8GHz Xeon, 3ware Escalade 7850 (7500-8) 12 port IDE RAID controller, 
RAID 10, 4x 1GB DDR SDRAM Registered ECC, 2x 80GB WD HDD, 10x 120GB WD HDD, 
ServerWorks Grand Champion LE. 
I am running RH7.3 with 2.4.20 kernel. The performance of this box is about 
half of an almost identical box (Supermicro X5DP8-G2 mobo, E7501 chipset)
Also, this board can't even boot with 8x 1GB memory modules plugged in (8 DIMM 
slots in total). This is a relative new board and I can't find anything 
relevant on the net. 
cheers,
Song Zhao
