Hi all...
A little bug report haunting...
A user of -jam2 kernel reported me an strange error:
csum.S:65: invalid format `#line' directive
(in arch/i386/lib)
It is one of the files created by the fast-csum-D patch bt Denis Vlasenko.
The problem looks like as is taking the '# 2-' in:
30:
    # 2-aligned, but not 4-aligned
    cmpl    $3, %ecx
    jbe 60f
as a #line directive, like:
# 36 "csum.S"
Versions is his box (debian woody):
Gnu C                  2.95.4
binutils             2.12.90.0.1-4
It works for me:
gcc (GCC) 3.2 (Mandrake Linux 9.1 3.2-3mdk)
GNU assembler 2.13.90.0.8 20021008
Is is supposed to work ? Is it a bug in binutils ?
Obvious solution is to change it to something like
    # Remark: 2-aligned.....
TIA
