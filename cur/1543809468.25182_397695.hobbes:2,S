The value in the MBR must match the _bios_ value, not the value that the 
disk reports in its inquiry command ( which often will be different ). 
When creating a new MBR you need to get the geometry from the bios, not 
the drive itself.

If the value in the MBR differs from the geometry that the bios reports, 
then boot code using int 13 in chs mode will fail because it won't be 
using the geometry that the bios expects.
