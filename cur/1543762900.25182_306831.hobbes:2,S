 From userspace?  No.

I know debian provides a way for the udev startup script to create any
static device node that you want to have be created.  I suggest you look
at that as an example to do what you wish.
Also, vmware already supports using udev, yet it does not use sysfs.  It
does so by creating the device nodes in its startup script.  There is no
reason why you can't do the same thing in the nvidia driver.
