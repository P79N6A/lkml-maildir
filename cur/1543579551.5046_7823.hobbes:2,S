Hi,
I've read the december thread, I've searched the web and I could not
come out with an answer, so here I dare to ask (please cc me for any
answer as I am not subscribed to the list, I just read the kernel
cousin version).
I just installed 2.4.0 on my laptop (dell cpi a366x). I noticed the
kapm-idled process, which doesn't really bother me, with one
exception: my cpu is getting hot enough to start the fan, even without
any load. I compiled with the apm cpu idle option (here is a quick
grep of my .config file):
[schmitta@alan-schm1p linux]$ grep APM .config
CONFIG_APM=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y
CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK=y
CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT=y
# CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS is not set
# CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF is not set
This behaviour, with the same options, does not occur with 2.2.18.
So my question is: how idle is kapm-idled ? Is my bios buggy ? Did I
miss something when configuring the kernel ? Is this a really stupid
question ;-)
Thanks for any hint.
Alan Schmitt
