I don't think per-thread locks is entirely reasonable. The file descriptor
is shared between threads, which means that attributes (including locks)
attached to the file descriptor, are shared between threads.
I would suggest that system resources such as advisory locks be considered
per process, and inter-thread synchronization be performed using thread
synchronization primitives such as the mutex. Feel free to quote from POSIX
to tell me that this suggestion is wrong.
