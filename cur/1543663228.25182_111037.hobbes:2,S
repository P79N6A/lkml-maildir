I think this is a very good idea. In the long run this is one of those
matrix things, is SCSI on USB an entry in a menu of USB or SCSI? And until
we can access the option from either place and still have exactly one
option, we (someone) must decide which it is.
Clearly unless we do it both way at some time, some portion of the users
will find either choice unintuitive. What you propose is a step forward,
and if extensions are made in 2.7 which suggest rethinking, so be it.
Thanks for the patch, it's goin in my tree.
