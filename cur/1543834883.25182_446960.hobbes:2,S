The users of SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN can live with that.
Systems running with slab debugging on must be very buggy at this point or 
we were very lucky:
The list is a bit strange:
>* the pmd structure (4096: hardware requirement)
It is already exempted from debug since the size is 4096.
>* the pgd structure (32 bytes: hardware requirement)
We were lucky on that one in the past? This should break.
>* the task structure (16 byte. fxsave)
Would only break if floating point is used I think.

So also not relevant.
We now want to say that SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN is only a suggestion to be 
disposed of if debug is on whereas an explicitly specified alignment must be enforced?
