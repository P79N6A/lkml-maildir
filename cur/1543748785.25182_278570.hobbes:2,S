I think you missed the emphasis of my mail - one on measurement to
validate if this technology actually buys you anything.
The second thing you missed is that drawing a lot of power for a short
time may result in a rather negligable reduction in the overall scheme
of things.  Until you measure it and do the calculation, you'll never
know.
I can make the same comments as you above about the PXA255 processor.
"The PXA255 has a special idle mode which reduces power consumption
via the use of a special instruction.  Resuming from this state to
service the timer interrupt results in more power being drawed for
a short period of time, thus doing this every millisecond is going
to be determental to the total power consumption over time."
See?  Measurements in reality give the true story.  Words are just
that - words - which may not reflect reality.
