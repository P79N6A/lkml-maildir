Yeah, you are right. This was broken by commit
76d2160147f43f982dfe881404cfde9fd0a9da21

Just a small detail. The commit optimized the irq_disable/enable logic
by defaulting to delayed disable. So we want to keep that logic intact
in case that we still have a device which is handling this
interrupt. For the free_irq() case your patch is correct.
The patch below fixes the shutdown case and keeps the delayed disable
logic intact.
How did you notice ? I guess you got spurious interrupts after calling
free_irq(), right ?
Thanks for analyzing and reporting,

Subject: genirq: do not leave interupts enabled on free_irq

The default_disable() function was changed in commit:
 76d2160147f43f982dfe881404cfde9fd0a9da21
 genirq: do not mask interrupts by default
It removed the mask function in favour of the default delayed
interrupt disable handling. Unfortunately this also broke the shutdown
in free_irq() when the last handler is removed from the interrupt for
those architectures which rely on the default implementations. Now we
can end up with a enabled interrupt line after the last handler was
removed.
Fix this by adding a default_shutdown function, which is only
installed, when the irqchip implementation does provide neither a
shutdown nor a disable function.
