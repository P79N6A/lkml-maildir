(1) fix incorrect virtual address calculation in kmap_atomic()
(2) more compilefixes for arch/i386/mm/highmem.c
(3) checking for alignment of kmap() and kmap_atomic() virtualspace
        in arch/i386/mm/init.c
(4) rework fixmap enums yet again so kmap() and kmap_atomic() areas
        actually come out properly aligned
(5) change FIXADDR_TOP to -PAGE_SIZE so the offset calculation isn't
        as easy to screw up
(6) fix mismerge of pgd_ctor() bits that installed garbage pmd's on
        CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G
Also available vs. pgcl-2.5.70-bk5-2 as pgcl-2.5.70-bk5-3.
This appears to boot and run on CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G, but I've had reports
of some sysenter bug. If I could get them reproduced with this release
so I can look further into them, I'd be much obliged. Testers running
with CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G, please update to this release.
