Hi,
I'm a bit surprised :-)
I'm using a file list for initramfs generation. It's something like:
file /sbin/udev /usr/local/i386/build/udev/udev 0555 0 0
file /sbin/udevd /usr/local/i386/build/udev/udevd 0555 0 0
...
/usr/local/i386/build/udev directory contains full udev sources, not
just the executables.
Now "make linux" wants to rebuild udev executables, using kernel
build rules :-)
All details are of course available on request if needed.
This is 2.6.17, I haven't checked it but I think the change to
usr/Makefile which causes this is:

    kbuild: rebuild initramfs if content of initramfs changes
    initramfs.cpio.gz being build in usr/ and included in the
    kernel was not rebuild when the included files changed.
    To fix this the following was done:
    - let gen_initramfs.sh generate a list of files and directories included
      in the initramfs
    - gen_initramfs generate the gzipped cpio archive so we could simplify
      the kbuild file (Makefile)
    - utilising the kbuild infrastructure so when uid/gid root mapping changes
      the initramfs will be rebuild
    With this change we have a much more robust initramfs generation.
Should it stay this way or is it a bug?
