Hi Linus,
A couple of small fixes.
One for harmless sparse warnings and one which can prevent
crashes on 32 bit boxes using filestreams.
Please pull from the for-linus branch:
    git pull git://oss.sgi.com:8090/xfs/xfs-2.6.git for-linus
This will update the following files:
 fs/xfs/xfs_filestream.c  |    7 ++++---
 fs/xfs/xfs_log_recover.c |    4 ++--

    [XFS] fix valid but harmless sparse warning
    
    The new xlog_recover_do_reg_buffer checks call be16_to_cpu on di_gen which
    is a 32bit value so sparse rightly complains. Fortunately the warning is
    harmless because we don't care for the value, but only whether it's
    non-NULL. Due to that fact we can simply kill the endian swaps on this and
    the previous di_mode check entirely.

    [XFS] fix filestreams on 32-bit boxes
    
    xfs_filestream_mount() sets up an mru cache with:
      err = xfs_mru_cache_create(&mp->m_filestream, lifetime, grp_count,
      (xfs_mru_cache_free_func_t)xfs_fstrm_free_func);
    but that cast is causing problems...
      typedef void (*xfs_mru_cache_free_func_t)(unsigned long, void*);
    but:
      void xfs_fstrm_free_func( xfs_ino_t ino, fstrm_item_t *item)
    so on a 32-bit box, it's casting (32, 32) args into (64, 32) and I assume
    it's getting garbage for *item, which subsequently causes an explosion.
    With this change the filestreams xfsqa tests don't oops on my 32-bit box.
