No, I didn't get the latest source (you did disapear for a while :) ).
I started to work on the old source because:
  A - I really wanted to know if this could be done and what kind of 
improvements could be expected, even if the actual changes were thrown 
away in the end
  B - you said that only small bug fixes were made since this version, 
so I probably could diff the source I started from against the latest 
and do the same fixes to my latest source.
One other thing, is there a simple way to test the emulator? I've been 
careful with the changes I did not to change the resulting behaviour of 
the emulator, but I can not _absolutely_ sure that I didn't break 
anything. It would be very good to try the emulator in a controlled 
environment.
Anyway, I think I'll have some more time tonight, so probably tomorrow 
I'll have more information about the final code size.
