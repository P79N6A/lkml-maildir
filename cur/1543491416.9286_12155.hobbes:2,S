The bttv is hairy because it maps a lot of vmalloc space using scatter
gather DMA. If you need 32K for a 3D acceleration buffer then you can 
handle it much more cleanly than the bttv driver. Take a look at the
sound drivers. They kmalloc a block of memory and mmap it into the user
space. Thats pretty clean
