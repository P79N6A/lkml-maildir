And on SLOB, which doesn't have those bloaty power-of-2 constraints?
Looks like ~500 reallocs, including 250000 bytes of memcpy. Ouch!
SLAB and SLUB (accidentally) internalize the optimization that I'm
proposing: grow the string by a constant factor at each step. Failing
to do that makes the behavior dismal.
