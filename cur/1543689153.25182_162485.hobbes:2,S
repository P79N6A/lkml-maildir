Some days ago a patch for 2.6 has been posted on bugzilla, (see some of the 
last entries of Bug #10).
This one got IO-APIC + ACPI working for the first time in a year on my EPOX 
8k5a3+.
(via-rhine, usb , sound )
Please try !
Christian
P.S. there's also a patch for 2.4 (search for "Fixing USB interrupts problems" 
in the subject)
