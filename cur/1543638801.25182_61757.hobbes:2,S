That's right - that's exactly why I wrote "suppress compiler warning".
It's just the compiler not smart enough (of course, i looked at the code
paths and I'd just fix it if it was broken).
Anyway, it seems there are more places like that in the kernel tree, so,
as Alan said, the correct thing to improve is the compiler (not even sure
if gcc3 would print the warning, I'm using RH "2.96" gcc).
