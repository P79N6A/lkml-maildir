Having the name is fine -- I agree it should not be removed.
However, that was not the point of my message.  The point is, each 
changeset comment comes with -no context at all-.  If the author of the 
comment assumes that, by his name, we can figure out what a comment like 
"minor fixes" mean, that author is making a mistake.  Each cset comment 
needs to tell exactly what the change is, and should not require 
knowledge of the author's identity to determine what is in the changeset.
