Subject: [PATCH] wrong disk index in /proc/stat
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
I posted this patch already from my home mail account on June 20 (subject:
disk_index weirdness), but no one seems to have noticed - therefore I
try again. Those who _have_ noticed the other mail - sorry for bothering).
The disk_index routine erroneously adds 2 to the index of disks on the
first IDE controller which is wriong in 2.4, because disks are indexed
by major number now. The patch fixes this and adds support for some more
major numbers. (To fully benefit, DK_MAX_MAJOR in
include/linux/kernel_stat.h must be increased).
The patch is against plain 2.4.5.
Regards,
Martin
