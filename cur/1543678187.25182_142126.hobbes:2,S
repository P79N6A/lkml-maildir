Hmm, both of them are already behind my work, and I just started this
week. :)
Ok, this isn't fair as I mainly concentrated on the bzlib itself,
jffs2 is likely the easiest user of compression in the kernel.  No
personal offense please.
Jeff didn't copy lib/inflate.c, a horrible hack that has to go, so his
patch is much better from that perspective.  But he kept the bzlib
pretty much verbatim, incl. _WIN32, functions working with FILE* and
so on.  Once you cut all that out, you start to see the real beauty of
the bzlib, it is much nicer than the older zlib.
Still, the blockSize100k part is just plain stupid and should die. 
Oh yes, thanks for the link.  Didn't know that patch.
