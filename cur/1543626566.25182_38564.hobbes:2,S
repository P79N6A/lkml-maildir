 Or shortly:
$ make "ARCH=<arch>" "CROSS_COMPILE=<prefix>" <whatever>
Here <arch> is "mips" and <prefix> is whatever prefix is is used for your
cross-compiling toolchain (e.g. "mips-linux-" or "mipsel-linux-", etc.).

 Actually 2.4.19 should contain most bits from the current linux_2_4
branch from oss.  Just grab the current "-pre" version.
 Getting a CVS snapshot from oss is certainly a solution as well, but the
server seems to be broken for the last few days (including its CVS server,
its mailing list server and its web server).
