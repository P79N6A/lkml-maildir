Well the first step is to consolidate the existing duplication in 2.6.5
before thinking about new features.  That's largely a cut-n-paste job which
I've been meaning to get onto but alas have not.  I don't want to dump it
on you just because you want to tend to your COWs so if you have other
things to do, please let me know.
We could use the `weak' attribute in mm/hugetlbpage.c for those cases where
one arch really needs to do something different.
