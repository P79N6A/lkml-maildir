Hi all,
I've been using Reiser4 on a couple of filesystems to give it a shot, 
and although it has been working fine for a while I've noticed that 
newer versions of the patch cause lockups on my machine. It all started 
when I upgraded to the reiser4-for-2.6.13-1.patch.gz from 
reiser4-for-2.6.12-3.patch.gz, which works fine. I've also tested a 
vanilla 2.6.14-rc4-mm1 which has the same symptoms.
I don't get any OOPSes or BUGs or anything, not on my screen nor on my 
serial console (although I'm not sure I have this working right--I only 
seem to get kernel boot messages). Machine replies to pings but I can't 
SSH, and the watchdog doesn't kick in (hangcheck or w83627hf_wdt) so I 
only notice it's crashed when I wake up in the morning. The crashes seem 
most lilkely to occur in periods of heavy I/O -- large Samba file 
transfers or updatdb do the trick.
Anything I can do to try and track down the issue?
Thanks,
Chris
