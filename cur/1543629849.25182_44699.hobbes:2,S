Amen, We would only have to add a device special file
to some of the /devices Stuff and /dev/ could be a symlink tree
pointing there...
I have *intentionally* named the standard mounting point
of the devicefs /devices the time I added the description
how to mount it to the driver-model.txt. The following words
are from *me*:
This can be done permanently by providing the following entry into the
/dev/fstab (under the provision that the mount point does exist, of course):
none            /devices        driverfs    defaults            0       0
Or by hand on the command line:
~: mount -t driverfs none /devices
