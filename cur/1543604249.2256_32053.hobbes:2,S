If it's purerly I/O even mainline that is missing the reschedule points
shouldn't matter.
Infact the only thing that hurts during pure I/O (I mean not I/O from
cache, I mean real I/O to disk) is the browse of the lru dirty lists in
buffer.c and the vm lists (the latter are covered in latest 2.4). And
just the preemptive patch cannot help there since they're both covered
by locks and the explicit checks in the preemptive patch will get a
result equal to the lowlatency approch.
If it's mixed I/O half from cache and half from disk, then the lack of
reschedule points could be the culprit of course.
