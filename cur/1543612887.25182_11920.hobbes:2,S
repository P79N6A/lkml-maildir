No, its only the .note & .comment section.
objcopy -R .note -R .comment  -S vmlinux mImage
gzip -9 mImage
makes a very nice & small Kernel Image.
(This will always be smaller than bzImage, 
because the compression / bsetup and bootsector code isn't inside the Kernel).

The Module loader isn't really grub specified, 
at least do you know any bootloader who works on every platform 
Linux supports ?
And what's wrong with the multiboot specification ?
OK it is highly i386 Specified, but it defines the minimal things a 
boot-loader should do for the kernel (multiple Kernel Modules, a commandline, 
a memorymap ....). 
The main problem with my patch for the moment is that the code I have copied 
from insmod is really ugly. 
For example obj_load.c allocates memory without freeing it after an error 
(i have fixed this, but i think it's only 1 of 100 memory leaks this code 
have).
This works in an elf-program quiet well, but you can't do that inside the 
Kernel.
Somebody with real god knowledge off elf-object files should take a look at 
this 
MfG, Christian König.
I can not promise you that this patch work, but i can promise you i will 
do my best to make it working. (Sorry for my poor English).
