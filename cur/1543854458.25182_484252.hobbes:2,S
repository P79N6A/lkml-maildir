Yes. Please don't use "dwork" as a name AT ALL. Not in "dwork_struct" and 
not in "queue_dwork()".
"dwork" just sounds d[w]orky. More importantly, we don't use short-hand 
that isn't obvious, unless there is some industry-standard and old meaning 
to it that everybody understands. "delayed_work" may be more typing, but 
anybody who needs to type things that fast had better slow down anyway to 
_think_.
No excuses for short and unreadable names.
