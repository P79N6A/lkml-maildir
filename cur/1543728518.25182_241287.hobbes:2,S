Why is this better than LRMI in user mode. To do BIOS calls safely
you need to be very careful about things like PCI locking, I/O 
emulation and the ROM scribbling in strange places. LRMI can handle this
in user space as does x86emu in Xorg.
All you should thus need is an ioctl in vesafb to tell it you've 
changed the display properties and here is the new layout to use.
