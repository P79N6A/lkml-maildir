Do you use anything besides a fan to keep your processors cool?  I've no
experience with athlons on UP machines, but amd76x_pm does a good job on
MPs.  I'm not joking: lmsensors sometimes reports 38C on low load.

Seems like athlon 2000+ MPs are more robust.  Playing cube rises
temperature to 78C without any problems.
