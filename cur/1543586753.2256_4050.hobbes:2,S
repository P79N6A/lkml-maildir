Good morning and excuse for disturbing you
I have to mantain an HP netserver lh4 in Statale University of Milan (Italy).
Due to some routing issues I would like to switch to kernel 2.4.
I'm not a kernel hacjer but I have already installed it on two nobrand boxes 
(one with redhat 6.1 and the other with mandrake 7.2).
With netserver the problem I think is the allocation of PCI resources. 
Maybe is the 450NX chipset the cause of the problem.
After having ercompiled and installed yhe new kernel during the boot I recive 
some messages like:
PCI: cannot allocate resource region 0 for 0:1.4
PCI: cannot allocate resource region 1 for 0:1.4
PCI: cannot allocate resource region 2 for 0:1.4
PCI: cannot allocate resource region 0 for 0:1.6
PCI: cannot allocate resource region 1 for 0:1.6
PCI: cannot allocate resource region 2 for 0:1.6
PCI: cannot allocate resource region 0 for 0:1.7
PCI: cannot allocate resource region 1 for 0:1.7
PCI: cannot allocate resource region 2 for 0:1.7
device 4 is an ethernet adapter while device 6 and 7 are (according to lspci 
of kernel 2.2.18) the two scsi channels.
there are 2 other network adapters on 0:2.x (which I think is the other pci 
bus) but they are not mentioned during 2.4.3 boot.
To make things short and quick after these messages the controller give me a 
message of CACHE FAILED and doesn't recognize its devices, so that the kernel 
doesn't find the root partition.
What do I miss? Do you have notices of a Netserver lh4 running a 2.4.x kernel?
Any suggestion is really welcome.
I can post my current kernel config, any output I can obtain from a 2.2.18 
kernel (which is still running at the moment).
Thanks in advance,
