	A potential for deadlock occurs if a process controlling a locked 
	region is put to sleep by attempting to lock another process' 
	locked region. If the system detects that sleeping until a locked 
	region is unlocked would cause a deadlock, fcntl() shall fail with 
	an [EDEADLK] error.
This is what POSIX says [1], even after being modified with respect to 
POSIX Threads Extension, right?
So it doesn't deal with threads at all, just processess are taken into 
account. Probably for a reason :)
