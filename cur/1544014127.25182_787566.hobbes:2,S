Yes, this is the only cheap way to do this.
Note, we are already scanning the full source files using a custom
tool to generate dependencies.... oh nevermind, we used to use a
custom tool, we seem to be just transforming gcc -MD output now.
Anyways, if we were still using that custom optimized parser we could
have put the Kconfig/Makefile info extracter in there.
