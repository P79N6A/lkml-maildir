Yes but again this is userspace. I was thinking about solution used
back in the old days in SoftICE kernel level debugger.
It had a BPR command (breakpoint on range) which could monitor
up to 400000 bytes of memory range. Unfortunately for me this command
works in very old versions of _that_ other OS.

I thought about UML or maybe even playing with Xen would be better (is
host kernel
transparent to Xen ? ie. does Xen have access to the same hardware as
host kernel?)
but in the end I'd go for kernel page fault handler anyways.
