IDE limit is 137GB, not 128GB.
2.6.0-test4 should be okay, unless you have Promise PDC20265,
then you should use 2.6.0-test5 (allows LBA48 DMA on PDC20265).
Latest 2.4-ac may be even better if you have i.e. ALi IDE controller.
It will use DMA transfers for < 137GB area and PIO for > 137GB,
whereas 2.6 will always use PIO.
