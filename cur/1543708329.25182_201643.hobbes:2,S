hm, OK.  I've converted all the down_read_trylock() things into a sinple
down_read(), to address the pdflush-busywait problem which Hugh identified.
This does mean that pdflush can get blocked by ongoing sync activity but
that's probably insignificant and we have per-spindle pdflush collision
avoidance which will help a bit.
Call me lazy, but could you please work out the ranking of wb_rwsem with
respect to the other VFS locks, update the locking documentation in
mm/filemap.c and make sure that we're actually adhering to it?  Thanks.
