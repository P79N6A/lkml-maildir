Hi Tony,
Just a me too earlier today with 2.4.19-pre2-ac4, on a dual celeron
440BX-based system.
Im my case, I have 3 hdds in a raid-5, hda, hdb, and hdc.
hda and hdb were both performing as expected 18-22MB/sec.  hdc was 
down at the 1.8-2.2MB/sec - even after trying to use hdparm to reset
the drive transfer rates (-p, -d1 -X66, -d0 -X12 (to try pio) etc).
None of the attempts using hdparm altered the hdc transfer rate in any
noticable fashion.  I powered down the machine, and on reboot, the hdc
transfer rate returned to the expected range 18-22MB/sec), and the
raid performance went up to it's usual level from the 5MB/sec it was
showing.
I couldn't see any reason for the odd behaviour, and I had put it down
to 'just one of those things' as the 3 or 4 test reboots since haven't
produced the strangely low-transfer rate again.
Cheers,
Mark

Yes.  On another system, I pull 35-40MB/sec off each individual
barracuda IV drive, and 50+ from the combined raid array (I assume PCI 
bandwidth limited, as twiddling BIOS PCI settings boosted this from 41 
to 50).
Regards,
Mark
