I'll check into that.

I'll have to do this tonight.  I can't start the machine remotely. :)

It only has an option for "wake on PME," which I've activated.  Again,
as I've said, shutting down from Win XP allows WOL, so the difference is
between how Linux and Windows handle the GigE device or handle shutdown.

Sorry, I should have given more details.  It's Linux-2.6.11.7 with no
other patches.  I think the earliest I tested this was with 2.6.9, and
it didn't work there either.
Thanks,
