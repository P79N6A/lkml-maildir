I did, in a previous incarnation of this thread 2-3 days ago, post the 
lsmod output and a section of the log showing (I believe) rampant dma 
failures.  It also didn't generate any comments.
FWIW, I have reinstalled the tarballs version of the drivers, but that 
was of no use, so its definitely something in the RT patch itself I 
believe.  2.6.12-rc1 works great.  By default.
As far as my being able to fix that, I'm afraid I'll have to plead 
NDI.  The last time I dealt with dma, was on an rca 1802 cpu, which 
had its own builtin dma controller that took care of everything but 
the pointer reload for the next 6 byte fetch, and which I used for 6 
bytes per field of video to feed a homebrewed character generator I 
made out of ttl chips, to generate the academy leader on a 
commercial.  The year was 1978.  A bit far back up the log for even 
me, altho I may still have a copy of the machine code I wrote that 
ran it at KRCR-TV in Redding CA for a decade that I know of, maybe 
longer.
That is neither here nor there now of course, just shining a light 
back up the calendar about 27 years for illustration.
