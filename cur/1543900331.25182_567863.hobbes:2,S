Subject: [PATCH 7/7] Use --build-id ld option
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/11/354

This change passes the --build-id when linking the kernel and when
linking modules, if ld supports it.  This is a new GNU ld option that
synthesizes an ELF note section inside the read-only data.  The note in
this section contains unique identifying bits called the "build ID",
which are generated so as to be different for any two linked ELF files
that aren't identical.  The build ID can be recovered from stripped
files, memory dumps, etc. and used to look up the original program
built, locate debuginfo or other details or history associated with it.
For normal program linking, the compiler passes --build-id to ld by
default, but the option is needed when using ld directly as we do.
