It might be that a modification isn't of big interest for the majority of
users but:
- It might be interesting for people working in similar niches.
- E.g. several development boards are supported in the MIPS port in the
  standard Linux kernel. The niche of people using them isn't very big but
  this doesn't prevent the inclusion into the main kernel.

But this doesn't prevent you from releasing the source code of your module
under the terms of the GPL.

The legal grounds become more shaky as soon as you consider that court
decisions might be different in different countries. If someone wants to
sue you he might have the possibility to choose between different
countries where he wants to sue you...  8)
