I've done the converse: package the uml kernel within the rootfs image,
and use a script that plays the part of bootloader. With ext2 at least,
it's fairly easy to use the debugfs 'cat' command for this.
That way, you simply distribute the fs image with a companion script
that can boot any number of such images.
