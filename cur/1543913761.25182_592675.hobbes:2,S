Subject: [PATCH] list.h: add list_for_each_entry_continue_rcu
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/10/96

To implement the multicast list callback in mac80211 we need to
do partial list iteration. Since I want to convert the interface
list to an RCU list, I need a new list walking primitive:
list_for_each_entry_continue_rcu().
Additional help text was provided by Paul McKenney.

John, I don't know if you want to merge this or not. There's no clear
list.h maintainer and this patch is requisite for the bugfix I'm going
to send in a minute so it'd probably be best if this goes into the tree
together.
If you don't want to take it, however, I have no idea how to handle the
situation :)
