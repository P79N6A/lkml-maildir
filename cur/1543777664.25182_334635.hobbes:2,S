Interesting question.
Are you adding one/some module parameters to vt.c ?
I don't see any there.
I have usbcore built-in (not a loadable module), and I still see
in /sys/module/usbcore/parameters these files:
blinkenlights
old_scheme_first
usbfs_snoop
use_both_schemes
but usbcore is "defined" as containing a list of .o files
in drivers/usb/core/Makefile.
