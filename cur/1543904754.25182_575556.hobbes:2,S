If it helps throughput in a non-trivial microbenchmark it would be
helpful. I'm not against it either really, but keep in mind that it
can make fork more expensive and less scalable; the reason we do it
for the NUMA domain is because today we're basically screwed WRT
existing working set if we have to migrage processes over nodes. It
is really important to try to minimise that any way we possibly can.
When (if) we get NUMA page replication and automatic migration going,
I will be looking at whether we can make NUMA migration more
aggressive (and potentially remove SD_BALANCE_FORK). Not that either
replication or migration help with kernel allocations, nor are they
cheap, so NUMA placement will always be worth spending more cycles
on to get right.
