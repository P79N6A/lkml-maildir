It's not trivial on ia64: we keep the syscall arguments in registers
(the stacked registers, to be precise), so to modify them, we need to
(a) flush the stacked registers to memory and (b) find the frame that
contains the syscall arguments, (c) patch the values in memory, and
(d) reload the stacked registers.  It's doable (like you say, ptrace()
does it already), but that's about the best I can say about it...
