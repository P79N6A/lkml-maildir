Would it not be resonable to just state that the isdn subsystem is not
developed and released in the same cycle as the main kernel and that the
latest-and-greatest can be fetched from wherever it is distributed from?
Later it can be integrated into the stable 2.2.x-branch once the isdn
system also has reached maturity and the message can be removed.
