In reality, the OOM killer I mailed a few days ago behaves
quite well in the real world.
I hope Linus will be as sensitive to theoretical arguments
with no foundation in reality as I am (ie. not), so we'll
have SOMETHING in the kernel soon.
If we later find out there are some problems with the OOM
killer, we can always change it then. No need to hold up
a reasonable solution when the current kernel has NO solution
to the problem at all ...
regards,
Rik
