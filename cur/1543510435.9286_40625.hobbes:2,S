Unfortunately, this works with some calls, but the semantics of
/proc/*/fd are a little screwy -- they don't dup() the file
descriptor, rather, they *open the same object again*.  Meaning a
different file pointer, etc.
This is due to the way open is implemented in the VFS.  I've been
meaning to hack up a different design and run it by the community, but
haven't gotten a chance yet.  Perhaps in 2.5...
