What's actually the exact statement ? Does anything change if you
don't switch from OSS to ALSA ?
Would something like this be correct ?
Sound
=====
ALSA
----
ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) is now the preferred
architecture for sound support, instead of the older OSS (Open
Sound System). Note that all volume settings default to zero
in ALSA, so user space needs to explicitly increase the volume
before any sound can be heard.
