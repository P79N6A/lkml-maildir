The HIGHMEM64G slab allocations are meaningfully performant vs.
page-sized allocations where virtualization is absent. I would
personally rather whip Xen into shape enough to be able to handle the
minimal pgd allocations than retain the oversized pgd allocations even
in only the Xen case. Also, the entire unshared kernel pmd shenanigan
in Xen is an artifact of its recursive pagetable affair, which can also
be done away with a SMOP.

This doesn't quite cover all bases. The changes to pageattr.c and
fault.c are dubious and need verification at the very least. They were
largely slapped together to get the files past the compiler for the
performance comparisons that were never properly done.
