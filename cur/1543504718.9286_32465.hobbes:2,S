Hello,
My Linux box with RH release 6.0 (Hedwig), Kernel 2.2.5-16 on an Alpha
(LX164) goes down with (no log, hand transcription)
Aiee, Killing interrupt handler
Kernel panic : Attemted to kill the idle task !
In swapper task - not syncing
I had a similar problem with 5.2, so I upgrade to 6.0, but ...
The box is handling about 400 users, but no more than 50 concurrently.
The most used program is "pine".
Thanks.
P.D. I apologize for my poor English and (if it is the case) for asking
     in the wrong list.
Ricardo
