Subject: 2.3.14 continues to break perl with libc5 (or does 2.3.14 refuse to support libc5?

It's been a while since I have been able to compile newer perls with the
2.3.x kernels.  I (thought that I) reported this before with earlier
2.3.x kernels.  Sorry that I haven't come up with a fix myself :-)
The Documentation/Changes file seems to indicate that libc5 is supported
with the 2.3.x kernels.  If it is not, could someone please update
the Changes file.
After trying to get perl to compile (5.005_60) I get the same
error as reported below the.  This error does NOT occur 
with 2.2.10-ac12.
the following 2 line c program still doesn't compile with libc5 and 2.3.14
cat qq.c
#include <sys/msg.h>
long infosize = sizeof(struct msqid_ds);
gcc -c qq.c
