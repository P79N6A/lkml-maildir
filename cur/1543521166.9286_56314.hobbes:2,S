Hello All ,
Apologies if i'm restating a known problem , I couldn't find any list
archives to check .
My new kernel (2.2.14 un-patched) appears to be missing version.h so i
can't run configure scripts.
I downloaded from kernel.org as a tar.gz and unpacked it how i usually
do (into /usr/src/linux-2.2.14 and made a symlink to /usr/src/linux ) .
Have i missed something obvious ?

P.S Keep up the good work boys and girls !
