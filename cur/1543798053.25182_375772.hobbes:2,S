I like it when the scopes for variables are as small as possible because then 
I also find it good documentation when the first initialization
of a variable also has the type. 
While it's possible with nested {} blocks too that imho makes the code ugly
because you either end up with non syntactic elements with wrong 
indentation (driving emacs/indent etc crazy) or with too much
indentation.
I can see Ingo's argument about catching merging mistakes though -
that is a good point against it that I didn't consider.

Ok. So should we enable that?  Or rather --std=gnu99
But actually I tried it and it causes lots of
mm/page_alloc.c:49: error: initializer element is not constant
It looks like casts in constant initializers for global structures are not 
allowed anymore: struct foo x = (struct foo) { ... }; warns.  That's
not good because when the (struct foo){} is generated in a macro
then it's the only easy way to allow initialization outside a declaration.
Common case is SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED() / DEFINE_SPINLOCK().
Richard, any comments on that? 
P.S.: Linus, I wish you weren't so fond of using downcounting loops: I find
them always slightly confusing (or rather they need more consideration
than a standard upcounting loop to understand) and gcc is perfectly
capable of reversing loops when suitable on its own.
