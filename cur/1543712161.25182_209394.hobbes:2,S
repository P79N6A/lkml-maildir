There seem to be still small issues, but I wasn't able to pinpoint them
to a scenario (I'm not even 100% sure they are related to the CPU scheduler, could
be IO elevator or VM too). Just thought I would mention them. Occassionally 
(very seldom, saw it two times yesterday) I have visible stalls (2-3s) of my xterms. 
It doesn't seem to be  related to direct visible background load (but i wasn't 
able yet to get a top up during such a stall) I don't remember these stalls from 
the non Entitlement kernel. They only happen very rarely so it could be 
something unrelated too. I know the report is probably too vague to be useful.
