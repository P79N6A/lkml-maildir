High load isn't necesarily a problem - it just means that a lot of
processes are waiting on disk I/O.  Because updatedb is flogging the disks.
Do a full "ps aux" listing and you'll probably see lots of processes in "D"
state, waiting for the disk head to seek across and read whatever it is
they are trying to read.
