Linux Kernel Markers - kernel 2.6.20
Hi,
You will find, in the following posts, the latest revision of the Linux Kernel
Markers. Due to the need some tracing projects (LTTng, SystemTAP) has of this
kind of mechanism, it could be nice to consider it for mainstream inclusion.
Recently added : completed correct support for Intel XMC-safe code modification
(erratum 49 of the Pentium III). I am not using the kprobe infrastructure
because it forbids instrumentation of too much core kernel functions (traps
handlers, lockdep.c, ...). I also made the "GEN_MARK" marker available at all
time : it will force using the generic version of the markers at a specific
instrumentation site. It is intended to be used at instrumentation sites that
are not reentrant with respect to the breakpoint handler.
lockdep.c/trace_hardirqs_on/off() is a good example of where it is needed :
the breakpoint handler calls hardirq tracing event when it returns.
The following patches apply on 2.6.20.
These patches compile fine against :
arm
i686
ia64
m68k
mips
mipsel
x86_64
ppc 405
powerpc 970
s390
sparc
sparc64
