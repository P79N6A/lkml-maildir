I think muted is a sane default - the only sane default.  Otherwise you
could damage speakers or hearing.  Also many devices will be noisier if
unused inputs are enabled.  Is it really that hard for users to unmute
the mixer or for distros to create their own config?
Also, analog output on my emu10k1 works perfectly with "External
Amplifier" disabled.
