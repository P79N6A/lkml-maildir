An update on Cyrix/Linux problem. Since the last discussion I have performed
the following. First of all, I removed the sound card because Win98 could
not recognize it. So I though, eh, that could be a faulty device. Well, it
did not solve the problem. Then I downloaded and attempted to boot from
Slackware Linux disk. The same problem occured, the system rebooted as soon
as it reached some install level. I tried every possible combination in the
BIOS without any success either. When I boot ythe system with both internal
and external CPU cache disabled. it freezes giving a bunch of senseless
messages one of them says "CPU=0". So far the problem remains unsolved.
