Hi Sam,
the following build failure is present on the cris architecture:
<--  snip  -->
...
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `arch/cris/kernel/asm-offsets.c', 
needed by `arch/cris/kernel/asm-offsets.s'.  Stop.
make: *** [prepare0] Error 2
<--  snip  -->
The problem seems to be that the cris port has two different files for 
this purpose:
arch/cris/arch-v10/kernel/asm-offsets.c
arch/cris/arch-v32/kernel/asm-offsets.c
What is the best way to handle this?
cu
Adrian
