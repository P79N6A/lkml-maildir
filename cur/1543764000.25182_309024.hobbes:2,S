The long-term solution is to replace either the drive, cable, or the
motherboard that can't do DMA. A bad DMA operation can write data
anywhere (right into the middle of the kernel). There isn't
anything software can do about it. Software sets up the
controller for a DMA operation, then waits for an interrupt
that tells it has completed or failed. Software can retry failed
operations until software gets destroyed by the hardware, but
there isn't anything else that can be done.
The fact that disabling DMA makes the problem(s) go away is
proof that it isn't a software problem. There are flash-RAM
devices that emulate IDE drives. Most of these can't do DMA
and the IDE driver doesn't accept that fact. That is a known
bug. One needs to use hdparm to tell it to stop trying to
use DMA. In your case, the driver stopped using DMA when
it found out that it didn't work. There is no bug.
