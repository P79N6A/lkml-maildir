Sorry about the confusing diagram, I'll just write out paths.  3rd time 
is a charm.
my old driver tree:
/driverfs/bus
/driverfs/bus/pci
/driverfs/bus/pci/drivers/agpgart
/driverfs/bus/pci/drivers/cardbus
/driverfs/bus/pci/drivers/parport_pc
/driverfs/bus/usb
my new tree now:
/driverfs/driver/
/driverfs/driver/pci
/driverfs/driver/pci/agpgart
/driverfs/driver/pci/cardbus
/driverfs/driver/pci/parport_pc
a possibility for my tree when drivers that need it convert to my 
changes  and the driver model in general:
/driverfs/driver/
/driverfs/driver/pci
/driverfs/driver/pci/agpgart
/driverfs/driver/pci/cardbus
/driverfs/driver/pci/parport_pc
/driverfs/driver/pci/parport_pc/lp
/driverfs/driver/pci/usb
/driverfs/driver/pci/usb/hid
* I am not saying that usb has to be done this way but if you notice in 
the first diagram (the old implementation) usb does not have any driver 
representation with pci or if it does it is not displayed.  The lp 
driver is significant because it is imposible to cleanly implement 3 
levels of drivers in the current Driver Model.

    As you can now see in my new diagrams the problem I am trying to 
solve is not how devices are represented but rather how drivers are 
represented.  Sorry I wasn't clear.  I have completely removed bus and 
replaced it with a driver interface.  This is better because a bus does 
not deserve special implementations as it is a driver too.  My more 
scaleable interface can handle both buses and drivers.

This feature is well designed, if a driver doesn't want to bind to the 
device the request will fail.  Check the code yourself.  This is simply 
a userspace override for the Driver Model.  This is useful because it 
provides the user with more control over driver management.  If two 
drivers can support the same device and the driver model selects one the 
user doesn't want to use the user can change it.  This could even happen 
now with ALSA and Open Sound.  Since it calls both probe and match it is 
also a great debugging tool.  I'm currently working on a user level 
utility that will take full advantage of this and other driver 
management features.

Yes this does call ->remove() among other things.  In fact it calls 
do_driver_detach.
Why is above.

There are many ways to go about it.  I even left in a few extra 
fucntions in fs.c for other options.  The question is what's the best 
way to do it?

If you have any questions feel free to ask.
