	It tries to access WHAT? Bloody lusers cannot be bothered to use
%d in sprintf? Sorry. /proc/<pid>/fd/0<whatever> _never_ had been a
documented interface. They already were deep in it with (ab)using glibc
guts. And it didn't teach them? They _deserve_ to lose. Who maintains
StarrOrifice these days, SunSoft? Sheesh...
	Andrea, I don't think that kernel should work around the bugs in
_that_. Really. Backwards compatibility is nice, but preserving every
undocumented quirk that nobody sane would use... Sorry, but we really need
an addition to errno.h: EBITEME. Exactly for such cases.
