Agreed, this is a subtle bug, and was a real hairball to track down.
Even so, I'm surprised that nobody else has dug into this, since it
should affect anybody running MSI-X.  I originally thought I was seeing
a hardware bug, which is why I dug more deeply into the issue.
If Eric is seeing bug reports related to "no vector for IRQ" in the
wild, then I have to change my stance and agree that this should be
pushed to -stable.  Every one of those messages indicates that we
hit the race condition.
