Have you done tests _near_ 8TB with a 32-bit machine, even without these
patches?  In particular, filling up the filesystem to be close to full

There have been sporadic reports of failure for large ext3 filesystems,
and some of them say that 32-bit systems fail and 64-bit systems work.
There is a kernel bugzilla bug open for this, but it was never really
identified what the source of the problem was.
Cheers, Andreas
