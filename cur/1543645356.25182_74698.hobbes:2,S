Subject: 2.5.39: Oracle 9.2 goes OOM on startup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The startup procedure doesn't complete anymore, and the kernel kills the starting
 process due to OOM. Having been away 2 weeks I can only say that
 2.5.34 works
 2.5.38 OOMs
 2.5.39 OOMs
If nobody has an idea what i should try, i'll build the missing kernels and see at
 what point exactly the 9.2 boot process gets killed by OOM.
Thanks & ciao,
