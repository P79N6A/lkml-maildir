Hi,
In my wlan driver module, i allocated some memory using kmalloc in 
interrupt context, this one failed but its not returning NULL , so i was 
proceeding further everything was going wrong... & finally the kernel 
crahed. Can any one of you tell me why this is happening ? i cannot use 
GFP_KERNEL because i'm calling this function from interrupt context & it 
may block. Any other solution for this ?? I'm concerned abt why kmalloc 
is not returning null if its not a success ??
Is it not necessary to check for NULL before calling kfree() ??
Regards,
Lavin
