why? TCP_CORK is equivalent to MSG_MORE, it's just a different
representation of the same issue. TCP_CORK needs an extra syscall (in the
case of a push event - which might be rare), the MSG_MORE solution needs
an extra flag (which is merged with other flags in the send() case).

well, neither is clearing/setting TCP_CORK ...

huh? in what way does the following:
{
        int val = 1;
        setsockopt(req->sock, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_CORK,
			(char *)&val,sizeof(val));
        val = 0;
        setsockopt(req->sock, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_CORK,
			(char *)&val,sizeof(val));
}
differ from what you posted. It does the same in my opinion. Maybe we are
not talking about the same thing?

[this is nitpicking. I'm quite sure all the code uses '1' as the value,
not 2.]
