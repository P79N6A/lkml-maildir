Hello,
this is the latest version of the IBM eHEA Ethernet Device Driver.
It supports a new IBM ethernet chip on System p.
The driver has been posted on the netdev mailing list since the
beginning of June and we got little feedback so far.
Main functionality including broadcast, multicast, VLAN and most
parts of ethtool work.
Things we are still working on:
- performance improvements on SMP systems
- error recovery
In order to get this code ready for kernel inclusion we do highly
appreciate your feedback.
The patch series consists of 6 patches
01: interfaces to network stack
02: pHYP interface
03: queue management
04: header files
05: makefile
06: Kernel build (Kconfig / Makefile)
Thanks,
Jan-Bernd
