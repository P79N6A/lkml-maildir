Accounting accuracy will anyway be affected when a process is migrated
while it is still allocating pages.  Having a lock here does not
necessarily improve the accounting accuracy.  Charges from the old
container would have to be moved to the new container before deletion
which implies all tasks have already left the container and no
mm_struct is holding a pointer to it.
The only condition that will break our code will be if the container
pointer becomes invalid while we are updating stats.  This can be
prevented by RCU section as mentioned by Paul.  I believe explicit
lock and unlock may not provide additional benefit here.
