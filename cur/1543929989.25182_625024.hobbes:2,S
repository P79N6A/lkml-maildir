Yes, I can also trigger it raw1394_reset_bus() from libraw1394.

Yes, that's the case. The PHY of the debugging PC must be active before the
booting a kernel with the early OHCI-1394 initialisation on the debugged
machine.
I tried to to instruct users to do exactly that in that part of the help
text, but changed the wording now in to hope to make it clearer:
+	  [...] be sure to have the cable plugged and FireWire enabled on
+	  the debugging host before booting the debug target for debugging.
and I added new file, installed as Documentation/debugging-via-ohci1394.txt
to give a more detailed HOWTO with links to all available tools and a step
by step guide on how to create a setup for using firescope.

I'll submit that patch for full review in my next mail.
