Yes, I don't have a problem with your patch, I just wish I had been cc'd 
on it.  Fixing this is rather tricky, but I believe no strange build 
magic is required, it can be done in kernel init code.  Still building 
my SUSE 9.0 guest to test.  SUSE 9.0 is one of those that requires 
COMPAT_VDSO, yes?
Thanks,
Zach
