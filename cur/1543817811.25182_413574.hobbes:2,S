RTFD.  This behaviour _is_ documented.  Documentation/serial/driver:
  startup(port)
	Grab any interrupt resources and initialise any low level driver
	state.  Enable the port for reception.  It should not activate
	RTS nor DTR; this will be done via a separate call to set_mctrl.
	Locking: port_sem taken.
	Interrupts: globally disabled.
  shutdown(port)
	Disable the port, disable any break condition that may be in
	effect, and free any interrupt resources.  It should not disable
	RTS nor DTR; this will have already been done via a separate
	call to set_mctrl.
	Locking: port_sem taken.
	Interrupts: caller dependent.
If the port semaphore is taken prior to calling either function...
