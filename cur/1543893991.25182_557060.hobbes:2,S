You're off by a factor of 10-50.  The usual estimates I've heard from
people who ought to know is the minimum ante for fighting a patent
lawsuit is $1 million to $5 million.  Lawyer time and expert witness
time to give the judge a granduate education in the technologies
involved is *expensive* (since the judge may be really smart, but most
judges have no engineering background to speak of, so you have to
explain the technologies involved in terms that make sense to someone
with an honors education with a Bachelor of Arts degree).
Basically, in the US, you get the best justice money can buy.  :-)
