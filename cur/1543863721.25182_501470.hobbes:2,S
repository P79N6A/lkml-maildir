And that is critical for direct IO writes, of course.

OK, I understand that this does need to happen (at least for writes),
so you need to fix it regardless of the DIO read issue.
But I'm just interested about DIO reads. I think you can get pretty
reasonable semantics without discarding pagecache, but the semantics
are weaker in one aspect.
DIO read
1. writeback page
2. read from disk
Now your read will pick up data no older than 1. And if a buffered
write happens after 2, then there is no problem either.
So if you are doing a buffered write and DIO read concurrently, you
want synchronisation so the buffered write happens either before 1
or after 2 -- the DIO read will see either all or none of the write.
Supposing your pagecache isn't invalidated, then a buffered write
(from mmap, if XFS doesn't allow write(2)) comes in between 1 and 2,
then the DIO read will find either none, some, or all of that write.
So I guess what you are preventing is the "some" case. Am I right?
