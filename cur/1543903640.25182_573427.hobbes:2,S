Take a step back for a second.
The problem we're facing now is that we're getting some userspace threads, 
used in processing I/O, that are functioning as exceptions to the "freeze 
userspace, then freezeable kernel threads" rule. They are only exceptions 
because of that role in processing I/O - because they're de facto kernel 
threads. So, if we orient our thinking more in terms of I/O processing and 
less in terms of the userspace/kernelspace distinction, we'll have a 
solution:
1) Freeze processes that aren't fs related (ie stop them generating I/O).
2) Flush pending I/O.
3) Freeze filesystems in reverse order of dependency, the primary purpose 
being to stop them generating further I/O on their metadata.
Locks that are being held are only being held because work is being done. If 
we progressively focus on threads in terms of their create/process work 
dependencies, we'll see that the problem isn't at all intractable.
Regards,
Nigel
