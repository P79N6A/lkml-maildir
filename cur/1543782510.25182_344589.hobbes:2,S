e.g. if secondary_ops->capable is null, the SELinux tests aren't going
to show that, because they will still see that the SELinux permission
checks are working correctly.  They only test failure/success for the
SELinux permission checks, not for the capability checks, so if you
unhook capabilities, they won't notice.
