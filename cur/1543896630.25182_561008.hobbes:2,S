yes, I should probably use that for the nsproxy struct.
my 2cts :
the macro sets the align parameter to "__alignof__(struct)" by default. 
is that something we want to do all the time ? if so, why not change 
kmem_cache_create() directly ?
Most of the complexity is in flags. I did a grep and picked what i thought 
was the most aggressive. The macro would probably be more useful if we could 
identify by it's name in which context it can be used.
