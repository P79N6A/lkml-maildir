that breakage has been reported independently as well and the revert has 
been pushed to Linus yesterday - it's not upstream yet. See this commit 
in x86.git:

    revert: "x86: ioremap(), extend check to all RAM pages"
    Vegard Nossum reported a large (150 seconds) boot delay during bootup,
    and bisected it to "x86: ioremap(), extend check to all RAM pages"
    (commit bdd3cee2e4b). Revert this commit for now.
