There's also another checkpointing project called epckpt written
by Eduardo Pinheiro, which I've created into a kernel patch, ported
to 2.4.22 and added some other stuff for my Masters project:

You can download both epckpt and the other stuff at the URL above, if
anyone's interested. Unfortunately though, it's also only for 2.4.x.
