As you clarified off-line ... it's "pegasus", not "usbnet",
which is giving you problems.  That's entirely different code;
although "pegasus" could be modified to run on top of the
core that "usbnet" provides.
The problems I've seen with "pegasus" have more to do with
wierd chip behaviors (and weak fault recovery logic) than
with anything DMA-related.
