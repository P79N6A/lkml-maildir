That's a perfectly fine thing, it's the normal circle of life and to 
some extent I think we're in agreement.  
The point I'm trying to make is could we please think about how create
a world that is sustainable and based completely on open source?  There 
are lots of people who say you can't trust anything but open source, the
companies behind are evil corporate monsters just waiting to jump out 
from under your bed at night and grab you (sorry, couldn't resist). 
Seriously, if what you want is an all open source all the time, which
would be fantastic in some sense, then how about a plan that shows how
that will work?  Saying that open source is a child growing is a nice
analogy but what's the grown up child look like?  Is this going to just
be like the 60's flower children that grow up and turn into their parents
after all?
