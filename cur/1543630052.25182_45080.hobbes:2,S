Sounds OK to me for 2.5.
I do have vague plans to remove b_data and to replace all instances
with buffer_data(), which would kmap the page and calculate the address.
Not that I've really thought this through...
This may lead to the introduction of a `b_offset'.  Which would be 16
bits, which would snuggle in with the 16-bit b_size.   But I would
scale both these values by 256 or 512,  for the reasons which you
identify.
For 2.4, a 32-bit b_size would push sizeof(buffer_head) from 96 up
to 100 bytes, which does not pack as well into the slab.  This would
be an intensely unpopular move.  So you'd have to ifdef it.  Which
makes it an ia64-only problem, which greatly improves your merge
chances ;)

Not off the top, but they're probably there.
