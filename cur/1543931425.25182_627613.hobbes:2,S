Yes, it looks like the ioport region 0x540-0x55f is described both in
PNP and ACPI:
  /sys/devices/pnp0/00:0d/resources:state = active
  /sys/devices/pnp0/00:0d/resources:io 0x540-0x55f
  /sys/devices/pnp0/00:0d/resources:io 0x400-0x47f
  00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) SMBus Controller (rev 03)
        Subsystem: ASUSTeK Computer Inc. Unknown device 1869
        Control: I/O+ Mem- BusMaster- SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
        Status: Cap- 66MHz- UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Interrupt: pin B routed to IRQ 0
        Region 4: I/O ports at 0540 [size=32]
The PCI SMBus device was enabled by a quirk, asus_hides_smbus_lpc().
This quirk seems dangerous to me, and the comments above asus_hides_smbus
allude to problems similar to what you're seeing.  It's obvious that a
lot of blood, sweat, and tears have gone into this quirk, so I'm not
suggesting that it's time to revert it, but I would be interested in
knowing whether the critical temperature problem goes away if we leave
the PCI device hidden, e.g., with the following patch:
