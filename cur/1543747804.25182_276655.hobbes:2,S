yes it's the right one ;)

I trust you of course but I've absolutely no idea how can my patch ever
change any code that runs at that point during boot. mm/oom_kill.c can
be obviously ruled out. The changes in mm/swap_state.c (two printk in
show_swap_cache_info) as well can be obviously ruled out. The change in
mm/vmscan.c as well only makes a difference during an oom condition.
This mean it has to be the change in mm/page_alloc.c that broke
something. But even that should never run during boot (except for the
cond_resched instead of might_sleep_if that you already tried to backout
separately from the rest). There's simply not enough memory pressure at
boot in order to recall try_to_free_pages and run the modified code.
If try_to_free_pages is being recalled during boot them we've a problem
somewhere else, it should never happen!
Plus it works like a charm here.
Can you send me your .config so that I will try to send you privately a
kernel image built on my machine? (and before sending I'll try to boot
it locally ;) My .config sure is happily running.
Many thanks.
