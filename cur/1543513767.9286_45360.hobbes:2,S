Hi Everyone
I already have identified the method you people have suggest. But I have a
SMALL PROBLEM as specified in  my earlier mail (which part I am placing below)
i.e When I open a file in O_WRONLY|O_APPEND mode. Isn't it better that LSEEK
fail a -VE offset rather than succedding and telling me that its positioned
there and then Write ignoring it. 
Or may be kernel shouldn't be doing too many such not serious error checking
But ATLEAST the LIBC calls fopen, fseek etc. should take care of it. May be I
am telling in the Wrong Mailing List, if so SORRY.
Its just a SUGGESTION. I know there are other more serious issues but I
thought I would just mention it so that LINUX is the Best OS in every terms in
that it won't even allow programmers make wrong assumptions.
