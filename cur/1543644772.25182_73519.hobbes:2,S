   It's only this place in the code that ever modifies that word, and
   that happens only once during the lifetime of this address, so i'll rather
   add a spinlock to the generic PID allocator code, it's a very very rare
   slowpath.
You can't define a crippled primitive like this Ingo.
What if someone else starts to use it?
And more importantly, if you can't use it on a datum shared between
userspace and the kernel, you have to name it something other than
cmpxchg or make the DRM use something else.
