Grumble...this is why patches as attachments suck...grumble...manually
copied the patch below...
Overall, I like the patch.  I trust your assertion that it actually
works... :-)
I have a few comments...

Can we move this hunk closer to where desc is actually used?  It seems
like that would be easier to read.  I'd put those new lines just
before the "Retrieve data from check condition" comment.

scsi_debug.c has a definition like this:
static const int check_condition_result =
                (DRIVER_SENSE << 24) | SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION;
Perhaps we could add something like that to the top of libata-scsi.c,
(or some appropriate header file?) changing the if to read as:

It seems more natural to put these lines _before_ the "if ((argbuf)"
line.  It's probably more likely to be nice to the cache that way
as well.

Same comment as above about moving these closer to the "Retrieve data
from check condition" comment.

Same comment as before regarding check_condition_result static
const int.
I'd be happy to ACK the patch with the changes outlined above.
Thanks!
