I'm seeing a similar problem on some very different hardware. ECS 
P6LX2-A slot 1 motherboard, matched pair of Pentium-II 333s. This ECS 
board has been reported to work perfectly since something like 2.1.38, 
although it has a lazy BIOS that doesn't initialize the second CPU.
2.6 kernels show +-7 usecs TSC skew and exhibit very jumpy timers, while 
2.4 kernels are OK and show matched TSCs. I have no idea where to start, 
as the system is working perfectly otherwise (it's stable with either 
kernel series). Every 10 seconds or so the timers go haywire. 
Overclocking which mysteriously gets rid of your problem doesn't work 
for me, my system doesn't POST at a ~3% speed bump (which is the 
smallest I can do), and my CPUs are multiplier-locked.
Kernel bug? If anyone would like me to trace anything, go ahead and ask, 
it's not a production system by all means (read: toy at home).
