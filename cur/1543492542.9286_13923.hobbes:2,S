I am trying to use the DPT 3334 in a news server to do both
RAID 1 (for the boot drives) and RAID 0 (for the data).
It will run fine until the expire (or some other high disk use 
activity) begins.  Then it crashes with many wait_on_bh errors.
Has anyone else had problems with the 3334 in the following configuration?
Dual 400 PII w/ 512 cache
256 Megs of RAM
2 4 Gig drives (mirrored - 1)
3 9 Gig drives (concat'ed - 0)
2.2.4 linux kernel
Ideas?  Solutions?  a gun?
