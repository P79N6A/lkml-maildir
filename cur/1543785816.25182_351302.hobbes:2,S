This being the linux-kernel list, I assume your system is Linux, no?
Well, on Linux, execve *does* support script files. This is the whole
point of my patch - I would not propose a kernel patch to improve
this support if it weren't there in the first place.

It's not a config option because it is always enabled. See
fs/binfmt_script.c for details. It wasn't integrated into the binfmt
system until I made it so some ten years ago, though.

One shouldn't add complexity if its not needed. However, this patch
does not add complexity. It is fairly trivial.
