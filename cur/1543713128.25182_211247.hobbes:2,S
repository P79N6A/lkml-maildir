Don't rebuild.  If you have makefiles set up that the .o and _then_ the
.c can be rebuilt by parallel threads, you've got lots more wrong
already!  And it's a reasonable assumption that the entire build, test,
notice something is wrong, fix, rebuild cycle takes longer than the
granularity of your timestamps.

No, that's not right - read what Ulrich wrote originally about the
wrong options being in scope (exported by make) at this point ->
bootstrap miscompares.
