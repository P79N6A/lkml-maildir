Just because we have an api for helping drivers map data for dma,
doesn't necessarily mean that they all use it. In 2.6.8 ide-scsi will
use dma for all transfers. As I've already stated, I wont be fixing 2.4.
I've also included reasons for this. You seem to think that a 'DMA
abstraction layer' means there will be no hardware bugs, I only wish
that was so.

We were talking about device addressing, right? Or are you ramblinb on
about API stability again?

I'm surprised an ego of your size can even be contained inside a
normally sized (I'm assuming, having never met you) human body. I guess
in your opinion, anything oozing from your brain is by definition the
truth? That's the only way that I can see your above sentence making
sense to you.

Yet you refuse to do the same yourself.
