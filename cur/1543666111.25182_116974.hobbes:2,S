Sadly, we are constantly diverging the ext2/ext3 codebases.  Lots of
features are going into ext3, but lots of fixes/improvements are only
going into ext2.  Is ext3 holding BKL for doing journal_start() still?
Looking at ext3_prepare_write() we grab the BKL for doing journal_start()
and for journal_stop(), but I don't _think_ we need BKL for journal_stop()
do we?  We may or may not need it for the journal_data case, but that is
not even working right now I think.
It also seems we are getting BKL in ext3_truncate(), which likely isn't
needed past journal_start(), although we do need to have superblock-only
lock for ext3_orphan_add/del.
Cheers, Andreas
