It doesn't affect the soft-timer subsystem very much due to the
additional rounding described above, but it does affect anywhere jiffies
is used directly via HZ for time. Awhile back there were some issues we
had with proc output being confused in the transition via HZ, ACTHZ and
USER_HZ that were related.
This would probably be a good plug for Nish's time based (as opposed to
tick based) soft-timer work. By utilizing the timekeeping subsystem,
using absolute nanoseconds since boot instead of jiffies to expire soft-
timers we can avoid worrying about HZ/ACTHZ error in that subsystem.
Additionally it avoids any sort of accumulating error which could be
caused by lost ticks and allows for lower best-case latencies and
improved average latencies.
This helps pave the way for tickless/dynamic HZ systems by removing the
already broken assumption that ticks are regular and periodic.
Granted, the HZ/ACTHZ issue still exist, but the impact is more
isolated.
