I would like this to be so, but I've heard that current motherboard
designs prevent the core-logic chipsets and the processor from servicing
interrupts at full speed.
I don't have figures though so I can't argue this point.

I'd like "regular by design".
Note that RTC interrupts are just as inaccurate for user space apps
than 8253-based accurate timers -- the scheduling overhead and lack of
guarantee is still present.
