eh dude what are you thinking? Documentation/kbuild very much gives you
a FULLY standardized way of doing this. On all distributions.
The only tricky part is finding the build tree, for the current kernel
that is
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build
(as per Linus' decree from like 4 to 5 years ago)
for non-current kernels that's a bit more complex, so just ask the user.
Once you have that the rest comes for free.
