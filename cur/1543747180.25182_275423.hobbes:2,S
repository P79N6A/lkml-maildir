Are you able to time up to when the swap in is finished? Without that,
we're not really comparing apples with apples, it seems.

Would increases in the amount of memory machines have make this bite
more and more over time?
I guess the more generic solution would be to abandon using bio calls
and have your own device driver that could write the whole image to disk
without having to do the atomic copy. You'd have to write a lot of
support for drivers, though. I'd find it hard to imagine it being worth
the effort.

Yes; that's always an 'interesting' issue :>
