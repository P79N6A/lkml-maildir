That would be perfect, I would even go for a lot less.  As long as I
can recreate last weeks code of my pet project of the day, life is
good.  But feel free to make it even better. :)
Actually, you already do that, just with some html around it.  That
could be stripped off on your side to save bandwidth or I could do it
myself with a little perl.
Either way, nice service.  Should have looked there earlier.
