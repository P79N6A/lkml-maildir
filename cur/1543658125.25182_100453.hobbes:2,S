And it holds true, because
1) A huge part of RedHat's work in software development goes into free
(as in beer) software, which skews the better_product<->higher_revenue
correlation vigorously.
2) better_product<->higher_revenue doesn't work terribly well when the
market is dominated by a monopoly, does it?
3) Microsoft doesn't only sell software.
...
Don't make me come up with more.  Larry's comparison is totally laughable
if it is to support the thesis "Microsoft has achieved much more in software
development than RedHat."
