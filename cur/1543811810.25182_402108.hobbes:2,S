This is still possible but it needs some changes to most SCSI HBA drivers. 
The big requests are split into bios supporting 256 pages. For 4 kB pages, 
this limits i/o to 1 MB. The scsi_execute_async() path used by st and sg 
can chain bios and this enables large request at the ULD level. At lower 
level, the request consists of pages and now we hit the s/g list maximum 
length _unless_ the HBA driver enables clustering. In this case the 
adjacent pages are coalesced and the large requests fit into the HBA s/g 
limits. Well, now we hit another limit: the max_sectors default for SCSI 
drivers is 1024 and this limits requests to 512 kB _unless_ the HBA driver 
increases max_sectors.
The aic79xx driver enables clustering but does not increase max_sectors. 
This makes the maximum request size 512 kB. If it is possible to set
	.max_sectors = 0xFFFF,
in linux/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx_osm.c without breaking the driver, 
this should enable requests up to 8 MB - 256 B. (I don't have the hardware 
to test this.)
Several SCSI HBA drivers currently have similar problems.

I tested this with my SCSI disk and the sym53c8xx_2 driver with the patch 
I sent to linux-scsi recently (enables clustering and sets max_sectors to 
0xFFFF). The 1 MB transfers seem to work:
kai:/data # sg_dd if=/dev/sg0 of=pup bs=512 bpt=2048 count=10240
10240+0 records in
10240+0 records out
