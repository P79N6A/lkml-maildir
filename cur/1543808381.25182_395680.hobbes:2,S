As I did write _many_ times, this was done by the program "cdwrite" on Linux
in 1995 and as cdwrite did not check whether if actually got a CD writer,
cdwrite did destroy many hard disk drives just _because_ the /dev/sg* 
is non-stable.
People did not believe this and did write shell scripts with e.g. /dev/sg0 
inside and later suffered from the non-stable /dev/sg* <-> device relation.
