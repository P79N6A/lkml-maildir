Tried.  Crashes with 4 GB memory present in the box.
Boots and runs nicely with 2 GB memory populated in.
After adding  -g  to  *CFLAGS of top-level  Makefile, and
trying to determine WHERE those PANICs happened in rc2:
(gdb) list *0xffffffff80163a43
0xffffffff80163a43 is in memmap_init_zone (mm/page_alloc.c:1687).
1682            for (pfn = start_pfn; pfn < end_pfn; pfn++, page++) {
1683                    if (!early_pfn_valid(pfn))
1684                            continue;
1685                    if (!early_pfn_in_nid(pfn, nid))
1686                            continue;
1687                    page = pfn_to_page(pfn);
1688                    set_page_links(page, zone, nid, pfn);
1689                    set_page_count(page, 1);
1690                    reset_page_mapcount(page);
1691                    SetPageReserved(page);
(gdb) list *0xffffffff801196fa
0xffffffff801196fa is in safe_smp_processor_id (include/asm/smp.h:77).
72      #define raw_smp_processor_id() read_pda(cpunumber)
73
74      static inline int hard_smp_processor_id(void)
75      {
76              /* we don't want to mark this access volatile - bad code generation */
77              return GET_APIC_ID(*(unsigned int *)(APIC_BASE+APIC_ID));
78      }
79
80      extern int safe_smp_processor_id(void);
81      extern int __cpu_disable(void);
Not that those explain all that much...
