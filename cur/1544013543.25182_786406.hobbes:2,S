Time zones are described that way, but I was wondering why not use
zoneinfo, which describes the local time after an arbitrary number of
seconds since the epoch.  The leap second is a textbook case for
updating zoneinfo.

That sounds like an irrelevant quality, and as we've seen, striving for
it has caused difficulties. Worse, we've now got the situation where the
number of seconds between midnight starting December 31 and midnight
starting January 1 is incorrect.  The correct value is 86401, because
that's how many seconds there were.

It didn't have to, but apparently, and regrettably, that's what was
done; leaving an even bigger problem.  How many seconds does the
computer claim were in 2008?  Probably not enough.
