I stand corrected.   Actually a few privileges in Trusted Solaris are
actually
more "functional" than "security policy".   And these never mapped to root
privileges.

You can take care of this sort of problem with inheritable privileges.
A good privileged program will lower inheritable privs and only raise
them if it plans to exec() a program that needs them.  If it never
expects to exec any other program, you drop them from the permitted
set as well.  That way you can never re-raise them.  If an exec happens
because  of shell code the inheritable privs aren't raised and the shell
gets no privs, (with the exception of programs have forced privs, which
always get them.  But any added security helps, so this privilege
(CAP_EXEC?)
you  mention would probably be a good thing.

Great!
