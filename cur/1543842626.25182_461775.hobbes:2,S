It can't optimize __do_IRQ() out in any case if one uses
generic_handle_irq() because of the test in there which can't be
predicted at compile time. My fault ... Maybe we should go back to
having generic_handle_irq() not do the NULL test and not call __do_IRQ()
and have another generic_handle_irq_compat() or some stupid name like
that do what the current generic_handle_irq() does. I added that to
handle the case of partial conversion (which we still have to deal with
on powerpc as arch/ppc hasn't been converted).
Ben.
