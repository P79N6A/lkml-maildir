Tape drive cost?
One idea we've come up (and surely we're not the only ones) is to use  
cheap IDE disks for backup, possibly in a cold-swappable insert. As long  
as you can keep several backups per disk (say using some of those 100GB  
disks), preferrably even on a different machine, that's fairly cheap.
If you want to keep daily backups for a week, weekly for a year, and all  
on separate media, of course, that's *not* cheap with this method, and  
even DLT or similar prices become acceptable in comparision. But it  
certainly beats *no* backup!
