'sl is just an index.  Maybe it means 'slot'.

socket 'state' -- enumerated in include/linux/tcp.h

Looks right at a quick glance.

It's the value of 'probes_out', which has a comment (?) of:
/* unanswered 0 window probes */

Looks like a counter that is incremented up to a threshold...
For ACK handling.

Last 2 - 7 unnamed fields:
depending on 'state':
case TCP_SEQ_STATE_TIME_WAIT:
	refcnt bucket_pointer (no trailing 5 fields)
case TCP_SEQ_STATE_OPENREQ:
	refcnt open_request_pointer (no trailing 5 fields)
case TCP_SEQ_STATE_LISTENING:
case TCP_SEQ_STATE_ESTABLISHED:
	refcnt socket_pointer rto ato qpp snd_cwnd snd_ssthresh
where:
  rto == retransmit_timeout
  ato == delayed ACK predicted tick
  qpp == (scheduled number of quick acks << 1) | pingpong(interactive)
  snd_cwnd == sending congestion window
  snd_ssthresh == slow start size threshold (-1 if >= 0xFFFF)
I suggest asking such questions on the netdev mailing list
(netdev@oss.sgi.com).
HTH.
