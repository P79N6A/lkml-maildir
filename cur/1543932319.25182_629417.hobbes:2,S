Joe,
I'm curious, do you have a patch that actually fixes something and adds
value to the code? Maybe you could include the spelling fix with that to
improve the S/N ratio?
In addition, posting a patch with no commit comment is no good, please
read through Documentation/SubmittingPatches before posting an update
to this.
Thanks,
Jes
