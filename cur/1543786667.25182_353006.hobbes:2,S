Well it's pretty new, so no wonder. But it should do everything you want
and lots more. There's a list for it here:
linux-btrace@vger.kernel.org
I'm a little pressed for time these days, but I'll do a proper announce
/ demo of all the features starting next week since it's basically
feature complete now.
If you don't use git, there are also snapshots available on kernel.org,
more precisely here:
kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/blktrace/
but kernel.org is pretty slow these days, so pulling from the git repo
above is greatly recommended.
