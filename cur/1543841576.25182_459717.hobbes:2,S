I'm already working on etab (external text and binary) config interface

I wish to apply it to firmwares (as for once-loaded, as for multi-loaded). It
can also be used for any type (boot, runtime) of configuration needed for many
kernel parts.
In short: there is a config provider inside kernel -- dictionary, where keys
are names of modules (even in static build), every module knows what it needs,
and thus admin knows how to construct configuration and place in location on
file system, or feed in to etab when needed. Generally, there two userspace
interfaces: bootloader (initrd=) and runtime (chardev /dev/etab). No need in
*fs, modification in module-init-tools, just a dictionary in kernel.
Sorry for my English, and say it's stupid if it is.
Thanks.
