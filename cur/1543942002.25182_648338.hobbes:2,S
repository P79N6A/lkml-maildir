Thanks!  [ Reviewing was so much easier. ]

applied #1-7, #9-10, #13-22 (+queued all of them for 2.6.25)
w.r.t. #8 I'm waiting for Jens to comment on blk_{get,put}_request() approach
w.r.t. #11 ide-tape uses char devices and supports DSC so it is not as obvious
as in ide-floppy case that all atomic bitops can be just removed (extra audit
and some time -mm are required) so please resync/resubmit
#12 is already in Linus' tree
