In the unconstrained system-wide oom case, it scans each task on the 
system (which can take very long, ask SGI) and rates its badness scoring.  
When a memory-hogging task is identified, which you have complete control 
over in userspace by tuning /proc/pid/oom_adj, it attempts to kill a child 
first if it will allow for memory freeing without killing the parent.

It doesn't involve "hours of games," it is a very simple heuristic that 
you can easily tune to specify your preferences.
What you're looking for with your patch is simply a way to specify an oom 
preference before the task has been forked, but that's simple to do with 
the current logic since oom_adj scores are inherited and preference is 
given to killing a child before parent.

No, procfs is the correct interface for tuning oom kill preferences and 
not by name parsing.
With oom_adj scores, you have the ability to specify oom kill preferences 
within a cpuset or memory controller as well, whereas oom_victim_name is 
global and very costly when not found in select_bad_process().

It's very simple to debug the oom killer's decisions, which is why I 
introduced /proc/sys/vm/oom_dump_tasks.
It also requires two expensive scans of the entire tasklist (I introduced 
/proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task specifically to avoid _one_ 
expensive scan) when oom_victim_name isn't found.
