This is something I also noticed in the main kernel:
why & 4095? the kernel stack is 2 pages long.
I just checked the alpha version, they also scan only 0x1FF8 bytes (1*8kB ),
i.e. 1 page.
Is that legacy code from 2.0?
IMHO, that's a bug

P.S.: Do you think Linus would accept kassert() for the standard kernel?
