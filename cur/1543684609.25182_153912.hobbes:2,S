Thanks.  The larger question was about what state is maintained:
CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION=y was in the existing .config that I'd loaded, and
changing the view caused a gratuitous change of state that was only expressed
in the default value.
I guess that whenever the value is currently at the default value, and the
default value changes, the current value follows the default value.  That
makes sense.  (And I understand that the contents of non-visible choices are
all set to the default values when you save.)
It looks to me like ALL the PARTITION_ADVANCED instances in the default value
logic in that menu are unnecessary.  The architecture values never change
(and thus never affect the existing values loaded in from the .config unless
the .config is blank), so removing PARTITION_ADVANCED means that toggling the
view doesn't cause a gratuitous change of state (a non-obvious thing).  The
behavior would then be that expanding the menu shows you what was selected
before you expanded the menu, which isn't harmful to advanced users and less
likely to bite explorers.
