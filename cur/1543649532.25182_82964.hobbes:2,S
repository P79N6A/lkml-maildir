I don't know assembly that good - sorry.

do_wp_page is Defined as a function in: mm/memory.c
comments from the file:
/*
 * This routine handles present pages, when users try to write
 * to a shared page. It is done by copying the page to a new address
 * and decrementing the shared-page counter for the old page.
 *
 * Goto-purists beware: the only reason for goto's here is that it results
 * in better assembly code.. The "default" path will see no jumps at all.
 *
 * Note that this routine assumes that the protection checks have been
 * done by the caller (the low-level page fault routine in most cases).
 * Thus we can safely just mark it writable once we've done any necessary
 * COW.
 *
 * We also mark the page dirty at this point even though the page will
 * change only once the write actually happens. This avoids a few races,
 * and potentially makes it more efficient.
 *
 * We hold the mm semaphore and the page_table_lock on entry and exit
 * with the page_table_lock released.

sorry
I don't know
