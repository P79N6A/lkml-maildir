Well most of the bootloaders I'm working with let me change the
commandline. So why must I recompile the kernel to change the console
from VGA to serial ? Having a default commandline built in is great,
when
- your bootloader is not able to provide one 
- as a default fallback if the operator(me) was too lazy to setup the
bootloader
