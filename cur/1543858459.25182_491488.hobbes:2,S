Write a small kernel module which:
- create a device node per-card
- read the data from the A/D as fast as possible and buffer it in main
  memory without touching it
- implements a read interface to read data from the buffer
- implement ioctls for whatever controls you need
And that's it.  All the rest can be done in userspace, safely, with
floating point, C++ and everything.  If the driver programmers are
worth their pay, their driver is probably already split logically at
where the userspace-kernel interface would be.
And small means small, like 200 lines or so, more if you want to have
fun with sysfs, poll, aio and their ilk, but that's not a necessity.
  OG.
