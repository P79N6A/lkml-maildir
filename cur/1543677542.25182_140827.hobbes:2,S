why not a set of counters which are toggled between.
e.g.
         struct netdevice... {
           uint64        tx_pkts_counter[2];
           uint64 tx_octets_counter[2];
           uint64        rx_pkts_counter[2];
           uint64 rx_octets_counter[2];
           int counter_bounce;
         ...
         }
where readers simply do something like:
         tx_bytes += 
netdevice[foo]->tx_octets_counter[(netdevice[foo]->counter_bounce)];
and writer(s) alternate between updating one uint64 and an alternate one?
in this manner, you don't need to do any special synchronization or atomic 
updates or have any dependency on any particular architecture being able to 
do atomic 64-bit ops.
cheers,
lincoln.
