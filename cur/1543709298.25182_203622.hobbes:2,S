I know what the worst of the problem is.  efi_stub.S assumes there are
identity mapped pages, which my patch removes.
However there is at least this chunk of code:
	/*
	 * Show what we know for posterity
	 */
	c16 = (efi_char16_t *) boot_ioremap(efi.systab->fw_vendor, 2);
	if (c16) {
		for (i = 0; i < sizeof(vendor) && *c16; ++i)
			vendor[i] = *c16++;
		vendor[i] = '\0';
	} else
		printk(KERN_ERR PFX "Could not map the firmware vendor!\n");
	printk(KERN_INFO PFX "EFI v%u.%.02u by %s \n",
	       efi.systab->hdr.revision >> 16,
	       efi.systab->hdr.revision & 0xffff, vendor);
That is broken anyway.  boot_ioremap only supports one mapping at
a time and you are using the efi.systab mapping after removing it.
And the it is coded efi_enter_virtual_mode is not even optional.  Ugh.
