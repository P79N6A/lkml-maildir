I've done a finegrained size analysis today (see my other mail in this 
thread), and it turns out that on gcc 4.3.x the main (and pretty much 
only) inlining annotation that matters in arch/x86/include/asm/*.h is the 
onliner patch attached below, annotating constant_test_bit().
That change is included in Andi's patch too AFAICS - i.e. just that single 
hunk from Andi's patch would have given you 90% of the size win - an 
additional 0.17% size win to the 3.00% that CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING=y 
already brings.
The second patch below had some (much smaller, 0.01% ) impact too. All the 
other annotations i did to hundreds of inlined asm()s had no measurable 
effect on GCC 4.3.2. (i.e. gcc appears to inline single-statement asms 
correctly)
[ On older GCC it might matter more, but there we can/should turn off
  CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING. ]

Yeah. I've implemented __asm_inline today. It indeed documents the reason 
for the annotation in a cleaner way than slapping __always_inline around 
and diluting the quality of __always_inline annotations.

Yeah.
