Subject: Which HDIO_ command(s) to flush all data to disk

I'm trying to write a program that flushes all outstanding data to 
an IDE hard drive, including the write cache. Is it sufficient just
to write:
unsigned char args[4] = {WIN_FLUSH_CACHE,0,0,0};
ioctl(fd, HDIO_DRIVE_CMD, &args)
or do I need to worry about the buffer cache as well(WIN_WRITE_BUFFER?)
Thanks in advance.
