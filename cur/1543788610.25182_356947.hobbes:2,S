Hello,
 I have a strange problem with the su command. When i
issue a su command i get the error 
"setgid: operation not permitted "
I get this error in a machine that runs both fedora
and debian. Its a dual boot system. The error is from
debian sarge. I had disabled selinux in fedora. I dont
know if that would be problem with debian. I wonder if
debian has selinux. If someone can help, Then thanks
in advance..
