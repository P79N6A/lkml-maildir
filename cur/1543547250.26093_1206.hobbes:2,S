True for DOS.
On Linux, most file operations are done in RAM and only a part of them
ever committed to disk. And anyway, even if the process doing disk
I/O has to sleep, the sooner it releases the CPU, the better. Other
processes maybe need just CPU cycles, so why waste them? On a single
user, single task system I agree that the FS code could run seti@home
while waiting for disk seeks to complete... B-)

Again, it may take 100 cycles to do the job, but it doesn't mean you
can make them 110 and be happy. The *user* who's waiting for I/O won't
notice. Others will.
I agree that if you are certain that a piece of code will run once a
second, it doesn't really matter if it takes 100 cycles or 110...
you're loosing 10 cycles per second. But are you sure that all the code that
would use 'block_nr_t' is in such a slow path?
