I found the cause of this new behavior: font loading. SVGATextMode can be
configured to load a font with consolechars. It does that after setting the
cursor. In 2.6.11 vgacon_adjust_height() was changed to reset the cursor in
addition to the font size. The solution is: disable SVGATextMode's font
loading, and if you want to change the font, do it before you run SVGATextMode.
The second problem remains a mystery:
