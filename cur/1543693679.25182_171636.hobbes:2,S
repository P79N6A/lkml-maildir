Hi
I am not able to download kdb patches for linux-2.4.20 kernel from the
site oss.sgi.com. I am in urgent need of these patches. If someone has
these patches for any version of kdb (kdb-v2.5-2.4.20-common-1.bz2 and
kdb-v2.5-2.4.20-i386-1.bz2), could you please send them to me.
Best Regards
Madhavi.
