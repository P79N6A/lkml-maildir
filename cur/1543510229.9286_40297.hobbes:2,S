No, for Gigabit Ethernet I have to do some 5-10 read/writes per packet
to PCI shared memory, however these are not all one large block and
go to different places in the PCI shared mem area. Most of this will
have to be done with multiple UDI calls, unless they came up with a
scatter/gather type list for this .... yuck.
