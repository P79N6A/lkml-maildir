There's more to is than just processes: if your kernel has runnable
tasklets or pending interrupts, it is not truly idle, even though
there may be no runnable processes.
In umlsim, I have some heuristics that seem to catch most cases, but
may be a bit too paranoid. Look at timer.c:wait_kernel (called from
idle) in
