Ok:
VT notifier callbacks need to be aware of console switches.  This
is already partially done from console_callback(), but at that time
fg_console, cursor positions, etc. are not yet updated and hence screen
readers fetch the old values.
This adds an update notify after all of the values are updated in
redraw_screen(vc, 1).

It would be useful to backport it to 2.6.24.x indeed.  Earlier versions
don't have VT notifiers.
