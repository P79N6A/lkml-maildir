Please understand my situation. I've got GNOME running, gconfd-2 is a "registry"
management process that accepts connections through a unix domain socket (named
one) from many *unrelated* (child/parent) processes. In fact from most gnome
applications. I *do* strace it to see what it does. It does some write(2)s to
some sockets. I would like to know which socket leads where. Try to strace
gconfd-2 and you'will see what I mean.
For now James Cloos gave the best option, to look for a socket with an i-node
number adjectant (+-1) to the socket I know.
