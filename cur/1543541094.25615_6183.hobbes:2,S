Subject: [PATCH] First-cut IGMPv3 implementation, big, experimental
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This is a replacement of the IGMPv2 code in net/ipv4/ with IGMPv3.
This is a big and complex patch: actually two, one for 2.4.x and one for 
2.2.x, plus other changes to user-space include files, so I'm just posting 
a URL (hope this is OK):

If you don't know what IGMPv3 is, you're probably not interested this patch 
just yet. At this stage, this code should be regarded very much as 
'experimental', but we've tested it here with real CISCO routers (running 
both IGMPv2 and IGMPv3 loads of IOS).
Briefly, IGMPv3 extends IP multicast with source-based filtering both in 
the end system and local router (hence the API extensions). More details 
(and links to the relevant IETF group) are on the web page.
