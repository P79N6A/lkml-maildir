Same problem here with a p100 and two dec-tulip-cards and 2.4.14.
Driver loads without problems, ifconfig works too, routes are set - even
the 10baseT-link is detected (it switches to 10base2 when I remove the
cable, and back to 10baseT after reattaching)
But the kernel sees nothing on the wire (tcpdump), and nothing it sends is
seen by the other machines.
Dropped Packet/Overrun count (don't remember which of the two) keeps
rising for every packet it tries to send.
The woody-default-kernel (2.2.20?) works without problems.
I will lookup the exact card-type and error-symptomes this night, when I'm
back home. (And possibly try 2.4.15-preNewest, but kernel-compiling on
this to-be-router takes a long time)
