    compiling tunelp I have found inconsistency of headers __outside__ kernel.
    The trouble is in skipping of definition wait_queue_head_t.
    Following not works outside kernel:
    #include <linux/lp.h>
    Following works:
    #define __KERNEL__
    #include <linux/wait.h>
    #undef __KERNEL__
    #include <linux/lp.h>

As has been said already many times, anyone who uses
	#include <linux/foo.h>
is going to be burnt.
Linux kernel headers are meant for the Linux kernel,
and each and every program in user space that uses them
*will* break sooner or later.
(2)
In this particular case I can tell you that tunelp.c includes
a private lp.h in util-linux-2.9s but that doesnt help you too
much since that has not been released yet. (This week..)
It also uses a private lp.h in andrea's tunelp, which is available now.

You can very easily fix it yourself by copying /usr/include/linux/lp.h
to a local directory and removing all structure definitions for the kernel,
keeping only the definitions of the manifest constants used by tunelp.
