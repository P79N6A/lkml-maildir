Other drives remap on write by default.

Good so far.

There isn't (shoudn't be) such a thing as "temporary" or "permanent"
write error. A write error should cause a sector to be remapped (the
question about how many times the drive should try to write a single
sector is irrelevant here). The drive should not return write error
unless all spare sectors are already in use (which means the drive
is approaching death and should be replaced immediately).
All drives I currently use do just that (though I don't currently use
Toshiba drives).
I would rather ask Toshiba if it's a bug in their firmware and if they
have fixed it. Or buy another brand.

It doesn't have moving parts.

We have that here (ATA, and I think all SCSI drives have 5 years).
Not sure about exact price increase, though.
