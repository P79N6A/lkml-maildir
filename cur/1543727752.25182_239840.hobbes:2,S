Implement a filesystem interface, e.g. /proc/<pid>/keys
From here you can have:
  /create
  /<keyid>/update
          /revoke
          /chown
          /chmod
          ...
Rather than syscalls/prctls for each of these.
For keyrings, you could have:
  /proc/<pid>/keyring/thread
                     /session
                     /process
                     ...
Instead of having /proc/keys and associated locking/seqfile overhead in 
the kernel, a userspace library could instead traverse /proc to build a 
global list of keys.
In general, I think you may be able to move logic out of the kernel this 
way, e.g. userspace searching for keys.
