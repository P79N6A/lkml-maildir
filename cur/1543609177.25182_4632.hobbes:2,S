ext3 downloads are currently running at 1,200 per day plus
an unknown number of Red Hat users, and you're the first to report
this one.   So it's going to be something odd.  It _could_ be bad
hardware, but if it's always failing in the same way, that sounds
unlikely.
Could you please force a `fsck' against the fs, let us know the
outcome?
Also, a ksymoops trace of the oops output would be most useful.
It looks like memory corruption of some form - a structure
member has an impossible value.  Are you using any less-than-mainstream
device drivers in that box?
