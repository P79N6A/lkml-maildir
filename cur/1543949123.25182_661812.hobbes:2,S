If all that's missing for getting such a patch included is submitting it 
I would even do it with my normal pants on. [1]
I would leave the *really* fire retardant pants for the case that 
someone will ever try some "are binary modules legal" case at court by 
suing people operating ftp mirrors of Debian non-free and similar
repositories of other distributions... [2,3]

[1] no matter whether in the British or the American meaning of "pants"
[2] realistically, if these things will ever go to court, the person 
    suing might not want to choose some billion Dollar US company
    but some local private person or university as defendant
[3] like e.g. Caldera turning into SCO and a Linux developer fired by 
    Novell yesterday being hired by Microsoft tomorrow life changes 
    fast, and one of the many copyright holders of the kernel might some 
    day find some reason why he wants to do this
