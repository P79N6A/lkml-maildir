Could someone please convince me that we really _need_ to close it?
The VM handles the whacky pages OK (on slowpaths), and when this first came
up two years ago it was argued that the application was racy/buggy
anyway.  So as long as we're secure and stable, we don't care.  Certainly
not to the point of adding more atomic ops on the fastpath.
So...   what bug are we actually fixing here?
(I'd also like to see a clearer description of the distributed fs problem,
and how this fixes it).
Thanks.
