And please don't base this on sendfile.  Please make the splice infrastructure
aynschronous without duplicating all the code but rather make the existing
code aynch and the existing synchronous call wait on them to finish, similar
to how we handle async/sync direct I/O.  And to be honest, I don't think
adding all this code is acceptable if it can't replace the existing aio
code while keeping the interface.  So while you interface looks pretty
sane the implementation needs a lot of work still :)
