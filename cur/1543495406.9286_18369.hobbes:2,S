ext2 is quite capable of storing 32-bit uid and gid if the kernel needs
it.  Currently, uid_t is an unsigned short, so we only store 16 bits,
but the extra space is still reserved.  Hurd, for example, stores full
32-bit uids in ext2, and the on-disk inode struct definition includes
the necessary field definitions.
