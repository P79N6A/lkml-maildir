jamie.c now has plenty of non-Toshiba code, which I have not tested.
There are many differences in programming the codec, only a few in
programming the DSP.
FWIW, the non-Toshiba code does not work on my Toshiba, so the
differences are important.
jamie.c now has much more vendor-specific homologation data also.  I am
amazed at how much there is.  I need to finish PCI ID tables and things
like that before the vendor-specific homologation will trigger.
