Atomic operations versus locks is only a granularity thing.
You still need the cache line which is the cost on SMP.
Are you using atomic_add_return or atomic_add_unless or
are you performing you actions in two separate steps which
is racy?  What I have seen indicates you are using a racy two separate
operation form.
