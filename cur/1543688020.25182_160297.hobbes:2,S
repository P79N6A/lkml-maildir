I have a bad feeling about this.  We shall see...

Looks to be OK: as long as the page is locked you can't go far wrong.
But end_swap_bio_read() is called from interrupt context.  Hence the
spinlock you have in there needs to become IRQ safe.
Two issues:
a) what to do about futexes in file-backed pages?  At present the
   attacker can pin arbitrary amount of memory by backing it with a file.
   Your solution won't scale to solving this, because we need to perform
   a futex lookup on every add_to_page_cache().  (Well, it will scale
   fairly well because add_to_page_cache() is ratelimited by the IO speed. 
   But it will still suck quite a bit for some people).
b) Assuming a) is solved: futexes which are backed by tmpfs.  tmpfs
   (which is a study in conceptual baroquenness) will rewrite page->mapping
   as pages are moved between tmpfs inodes and swapper_space.  I _think_
   lock_page() is sufficient to serialise against this.  If not, both
   ->page_locks are needed.
   This of course will break your hashing scheme.  Hooks in
   move_to_swap_cache() and move_from_swap_cache() are needed.
So what to do?  One option is to just not pin the pages at all: let them be
reclaimed and/or swapped out.  Let the kernel fault them in.  We have all
the stuff to do this over in fs/aio.c, with use_mm().
It does mean that the futex code would have to change its representation of
a futex's location from page/offset to mm/vaddr, and the futex code would
need to hook into the exit path, similar to exit_aio().
Or create RLIM_NRFUTEX.
