Dave, I think you don't get it. People are paying to run those apps. When
you pay 10s or 100s of K$ a year for support and you see such messages
appear in your logs, you ask the app vendor what will happen at the given
date. Those people are already afraid by end of support on products without
any warning message. I sincerely believe that they will insist even more
when the message tells them about the end of compatibility date.
Of course, the vendor will say "we've been informed that this is caused by
a change in distro XXX. Distro YYY does not have it, you may want to migrate".
But those responses rarely satisfy customers who have to revalidate everything
to change a distro.
At most, they will ask their distro vendor for continued support of the
feature (which there will be in the same minor release), and if vendors'
feedback show there is enough demand, then we will just have to delay the
removal.
Regards,
Willy
