Hi,
I've reported this before, but the problem still persists:
Each bootup I get the following same errors:
Mar  9 22:04:32 Corona init: open(/dev/console): Input/output error
Mar  9 22:04:32 Corona /sbin/agetty[109]: /dev/tty1: cannot open as standard input: Input/output error
Mar  9 22:04:32 Corona /sbin/agetty[109]: /dev/tty1: cannot open as standard input: Input/output error
I believe there must be some sort of race condition, because the agetty spawns
after some time and once everything runs the error never occurs again.
Kernel is 2.5.6-final.
agetty is from util-linux 2.11f
init is from sysvinit-2.83
.config is attached.
Some feedback would be appreciated.
