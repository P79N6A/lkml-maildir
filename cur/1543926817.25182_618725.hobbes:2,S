so if _you_ have common sense, it`s up to you alone to make your own life easier and you should try hard to change their mind.
how can you make sure your code is good and stable if other`s don`t review it ?
why should you constantly work on porting your code to the next kernel release ?
even worse, you need to port it to different vendor specific kernels. that`s a real waste of time...
please try changing their minds and if you need some help/arguments i`m sure there are people who can help you freeing the source ! ;)
maybe you will find some at

I would also like to see something like this, as some work I'm doing on
working some funny networking (unfortunately IT department don't have
common sense) across multiple distros. Tracking the kernel patche
differences between the distros seems to be the hardest part (comparing
them to find what's needed for all distros to work).
