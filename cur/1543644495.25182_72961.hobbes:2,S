That's just for traditional Unix applications, which is only one category.
You exclude CPU intensive applications in that criticism, media related
and otherwise. What about cases where you need to balance a large data
structure across large number of threads or something like that ?

IO isn't the only thing that's event driven. What about event driven
systems that depend on a fast condition-variable ? That's very cheap in
a UTS (userspace thread system), 2 context switches, a call to thread-kernel
to dequeue a waiter and releasing/aquiring some very light weight userspace
locks. And difficult to beat if you think about it.
So that level of confidence in 1:1 is a intuitively presumptuous for those
reasons.
But if you're architecture is broken or exotic...then it gets more complicated ;)
