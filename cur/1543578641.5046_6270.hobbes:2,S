we *already* reorder vector numbers and spread them out as much as
possible. We do this in 2.2 as well. We did this almost from day 1 of
IO-APIC support. If any manually allocated IRQ vector creates a '3 vectors
in the same 16-vector region' situation then thats a bug in hw_irq.h..
the 'loss of interrupts' above does not include external interrupts, only
local interrupts (such as the APIC timer interrupt) can get lost in such a
situation.
(nevertheless there is something going on.)
