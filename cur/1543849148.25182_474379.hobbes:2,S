I've been chasing a bug that got filed against the Fedora kernel
a while back:  
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=199052
This is a dual pentium pro from an era before we had ACPI, and
it seems to be falling foul of this test in smpboot.c  ..
    if (!smp_found_config && !acpi_lapic) {
        printk(KERN_NOTICE "SMP motherboard not detected.\n");
        smpboot_clear_io_apic_irqs();
        phys_cpu_present_map = physid_mask_of_physid(0);
        if (APIC_init_uniprocessor())
            printk(KERN_NOTICE "Local APIC not detected."
                       " Using dummy APIC emulation.\n");
        map_cpu_to_logical_apicid();
        cpu_set(0, cpu_sibling_map[0]);
        cpu_set(0, cpu_core_map[0]);
        return;
    }
My initial reaction is that the !acpi_lapic test should be conditional
on some variable that gets set if the ACPI parsing actually succeeded.
Thoughts?
