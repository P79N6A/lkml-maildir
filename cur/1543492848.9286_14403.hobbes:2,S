Hi Charu,
    The ram disks under Linux have several limitations that probably make
them unsuitable for what you are trying to do.  I believe that they were
designed primarily for OS installs from floppy disk.  The Linux filesystems
do not do synchronous metadata writes and are therefor very fast.  I do not
think you need to do anything special to get tmpfs like performance from ext2.
If you are going to put a large number of files into a directory, then there
is an experimental filesystem called reiserfs you might want to try.  You can
get more information from:

I hope this helps,
Jim
