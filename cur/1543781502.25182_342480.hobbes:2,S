Just don't expect it to happen any time in the next fortnight, even
if 2.6.13 were to appear tomorrow.  Firstly, I have the parport_serial
patches queued up since god knows when (a month or so back now I
think.)  Secondly I'm not around next week so I probably won't have
time to do anything with serial in the non-rc part of the 2.6.14
cycle.
Therefore, I think this will have to wait for 2.6.14 or so.  Sorry.
