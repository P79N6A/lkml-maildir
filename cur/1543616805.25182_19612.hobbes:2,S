disable_irq only blocks _one_ interrupt line, spin_lock_irqsave locks the
interrupt off on a uniprocessor, and  50% of the time off on a
dual processor. 
If I use a spin lock you can't run a modem and an NE2000 card together on
Linux 2.4. Thats why I had to do that work on the code. Its one of myriads
of basic obvious cases that the pre-empt patch gets wrong
