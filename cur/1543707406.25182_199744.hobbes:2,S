It looks like hp100 is at least broken wrt probing, since it lacks a
EISA-ID table terminator. What about changing it to :
static struct eisa_device_id hp100_eisa_tbl[] = {
        { "HWPF180" }, /* HP J2577 rev A */
        { "HWP1920" }, /* HP 27248B */
        { "HWP1940" }, /* HP J2577 */
        { "HWP1990" }, /* HP J2577 */
        { "CPX0301" }, /* ReadyLink ENET100-VG4 */
        { "CPX0401" }, /* FreedomLine 100/VG */
        { "" },        /* THIS ENTRY IS MANDATORY !!! */
};

What are the other modules ? I'd like to reproduce the problem (I have
no PCI hp100 to check if the above fixes the problem).
