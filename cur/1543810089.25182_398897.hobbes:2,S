20% is speedup for compression alone, over whole suspend
process. Device suspend/resume takes lot of time in recent kernels.

Only feature I can't do is "save whole pagecache"... and 14000 lines
of code for _that_ is a bit too much. I could probably patch my kernel
to dump pagecache to userspace, but I do not think it is worth the
effort.

I do not need anything more than what is already in -mm tree.

So please take my comments from "suspend2 review" mail into account.
