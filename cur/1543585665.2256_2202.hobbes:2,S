no, not perfect, i very much agree. but in daily usage it reduces
chance of OOM to close to 0.

that's because it disables the very rough resource checking that
linux has. it makes OOM even easier to achieve:
mm/mmap.c::vm_enough_memory():
	/* Sometimes we want to use more memory than we have. */
        if (sysctl_overcommit_memory)
            return 1;
it doesn't make linux go into a 'non-overcommit' mode, cause linux
does not have the accounting to cover it...
solution according to more knowledgable folks than i, sysadmin, is
better accounting so that vm_enough_memory can be more accurate
rather than developing an all-seeing oom_killer().
