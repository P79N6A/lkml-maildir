I get this if I run the seti program on my system.  No other long
running process (so far) does this and it wasn't until kernel 2.2.5
that I had this trouble with seti.
I cannot test this program on 2.2.9 because that kernel will not
boot on my system at all... hangs after it sees the first IDE
controller for some reason.
