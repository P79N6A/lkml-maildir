There is a problem with alignment in the flow_key_compare function in
net/core/flow.c.  It takes arguments of type struct flowi * and casts
them to flow_compare_t *, which is 64 bits on 64-bit machines.  It
then proceeds to read and compare 64-bit values from these pointers.
The problem is that struct flowi only requires 32-bit alignment, so
these reads cause numerous unaligned exceptions.  On average, I get
nearly 1000 unaligned exceptions per second.
The solutions I see are either to force the alignment of struct flowi
to 64 bits, or to use 32-bit access in flow_key_compare.
