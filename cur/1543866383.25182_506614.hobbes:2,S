Looks fine. Especially considering the strange whitespace issues.

However, this one I have problems with .The problem is, many people 
probably _do_ have bash, but it's in /bin/sh. That used to be a fairly 
common setup a long time ago. Maybe it's not any more, but the whole "fall 
back to sh" actually came from that.
The $BASH variable is only defined if you use bash as your *interactive* 
shell, ie if you started "make" from a bash shell.
Historically, people used to do:
 - /bin/sh was the "standard shell" (bash)
 - /bin/[t]csh is what clueless weenies use for interactive work.
(Yeah, I'm not a [t]csh fan ;)
And you did break that.
It's quite possible that all modern distributions will install /bin/bash 
as a link to /bin/sh, but I don't see the point of that particular change. 
We aren't even all that bash-centric any more. If you have a 
POSIX-compatible shell in /bin/sh, it really _should_ work. It just can't 
be something really broken.

One thing I'm wondering about is whether we could have a "does this warn" 
test. I guess you can do it with -Werror, but it might be nice to have 
some tests for "does the -Wxyzzy flag warn also for proper code"
