I have tested your patch.
Kernel builds. I have not found much time for testing.
But I would not like to block changes and I am going
for next week to project meeting in Spain, so there is
my reply.
I have 2.6.19 + realtime-patches rt14 on the hand.
I have been able to mount and use some cards, but it
I have observed some problems probably related to timing
when I have tried to change CPU frequency.
I need to find time to do more checking on vanilla and RT kernels
when I return. I have some ideas what could be enhanced to ensure
better MX1 SDHC cards recognition under RT kernels. I am not sure,
what causes other seen problems, but I have observed these things
on RT even without your patch.
Conclusion: I knowledge your patch and admit, that I need to
find time for my homeworks.
Best wishes
