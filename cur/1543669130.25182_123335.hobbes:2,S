Zwane - is there any reason we couldn't just start re-using irq vector
offsets when this happens? We already re-use the vectors themselves, so 
restarting the offset pointer shouldn't really _change_ anything.
In other words, I'm wondering if this simpler patch wouldn't be sufficient 
instead?
Can you please test this, and re-submit (and if you can explain why your 
patch is better, please do so - I have nothing fundamentally against it, I 
just want to understand _why_ the complexity is needed).
Thanks,
		Linus
