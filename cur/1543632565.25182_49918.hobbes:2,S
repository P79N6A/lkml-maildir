Hello,
I wonder if someone can help me to change the behaviour of the atomic
functions available in <asm/atomic.h> include file. The operations I need to
implement are described below:
atomic_t test_and_set (int i, atomic_t* v)
{
   atomic_t old = *v;
   v->counter = i;
   return old;
}
atomic_t test_then_add (int i, atomic_t* v)
{
   atomic_t old = *v;
   v->counter += i;
   return old;
}
Thanks in advance,
Giga
