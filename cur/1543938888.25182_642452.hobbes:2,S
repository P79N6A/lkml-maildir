Btw, the downconvert code is functionally identical from what was in vote.c
for years now. It just got moved into dlmglue.c and renamed.

The rule is that only the downconvert thread is allowed to remove locks from
that list. Everyone else just decides a lock needs downconverting and queues
it.
Attached to this e-mail is a patch to better document this.

In this case that's ok. It's only used during dlmglue shutdown when no new
locks should ever be queued.

Another case where it's ok :)

Ok, a cleanup of this and the other whitespace problems you pointed out (in
resize.c) have been commited to the tree.

ocfs2: document access rules for blocked_lock_list
ocfs2_super->blocked_lock_list and ocfs2_super->blocked_lock_count have some
usage restrictions which aren't immediately obvious to anyone reading the
code. It's a good idea to document this so that we avoid making costly
mistakes in the future.
