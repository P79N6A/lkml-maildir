   Currently not, maybe in late 2.3.

   In depends on how deeply does dosemu know the card.

   Jakub Jelinek wrote a patch to consoletools, I don't know if it already
creeped to the official release. If you want, I can find it somewhere and
send it to you.

   By default, it's used only for switching the mode on. If you turn on
loading of palettes, it will require VESA PMI (Protected Mode Interface)
and this could mean problems.
