 I guess the 25th anniversary has already happened -- there was even a 
nice history of DEC computing published at that time as it coincided with 
the 50th anniversary of the company itself.  That's for VAX in general, 
rather than a specific implementation, though.
 Anyway I second the question, although I have a bit more interest in this 
area these days and I may push the merge myslef if nobody else bothers.
