But an ioctl is supposed to be specific to your device. After all,
you access it with a fd obtained by opening your device. To keep
`strace` from "interpreting" your ioctl function-code, it was
common to start device-specific ioctl function values higher than
the ones used by common kernel devices.
Using another interface to provide device-specific control is
more "Sun-like", "BSD-like", or "Linux-like", not necessarily
bad or good. The defacto "Unix" way is to use ioctl(). That's
what it was provided for; "The ioctl() function manipilates the
underlying device parameters of special files." -- from the
AT&T System-V release 2 programmer's reference manual.
Somebody reported to me that there was some special "optimization"
in Linux that interpreted ioctl() function calls without regard
to the specific device that was open (gawd I hope not), and that
if you used "already-used" function numbers for your device-specific
ioctl(), then strange things would occur. If true, then that is
a bug. Code inspection of fs/ioctl.c doesn't show this to be
the case. However, the kernel is now LOCKED during an ioctl()
call. Older Linux versions didn't lock the kernel. The upshot
of this is that if you have some ioctl() function that takes
some time, like testing the memory in your board, you will
find the system unresponsive during that test! You can unlock
the kernel in your ioctl() if this is a problem.
