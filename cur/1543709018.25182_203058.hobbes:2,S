I attached the test pgm. It is nearly the same as shown
in Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt
If you run it as root, it allocates 1 Hugepage, if run as user, it fails.
roesrv01:~ # ./a.out
shmid: 0x220004
shmaddr: 0x40167000
Starting the writes:
....
Starting the Check...Done.
roesrv01:~ # su - jochen
jochen@roesrv01:~> ./a.out
Failure:: Operation not permitted
I guess, a strace is not necessary.
The pgm has only the main function and only one position where it says 
"Failure"
What do I have to do to make this pgm run as an ordinary user with a 
stock kernel?
Curious...
