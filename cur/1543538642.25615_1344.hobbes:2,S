Not at all, base64 encoded email goes naturally straight to /dev/null
unread.
On the subject, porting a current Gigabit driver to 2.0.x will be a
fair amount of work. I had originally tought about porting the acenic
driver to 2.0.x but fairly early on decided it simply wasn't worth the
effort due to the not very exciting SMP support in 2.0.x and the fact
that the API has changed significantly between 2.0.x and
2.4.x. Keeping things compatible between 2.2.x and 2.4.x is hard
enough work as it is.
Kim, if you want Gigabit Ethernet I'd strongly recommend you consider
porting whatever it is you have that requires 2.0.x onto 2.2.x or
later.
