I did say it was the simple solution :-)

I'd like to avoid these kind of macros, and make it a general case 
solution (e.g. which can be used for various hardware implementations).
One possibility would be to allow registration with an alias list in
crypto API with attributes indicating whether the module is hardware,
arch-specific etc.
So, during init, the s390 arch could register an alias like:
  name .= "aes_z990"
  algorithm .= "aes"
  attributes .= CRYPTO_ATTR_ARCH|CRYPTO_ATTR_HW
Then, when a caller specifies "aes", crypto_alg_autoload() would first
check the alias list, giving preference to CRYPTO_ALG_ARCH by default.  
In this case, it would find aes_z990 and try and load it.  If this fails,
it continues along the alias list then ultimately falls back to the
current behavior.
This would allow subsystems and hardware drivers to dynamically provide 
information to the API.  Callers of crypto_alloc_tfm() could then pass 
flags specifying preferences for algorithm implementations e.g. generic 
sw, arch sw, arch hw, misc hw.
This would also need to take into account modprobe.conf configuration and 
compiled in modules.
