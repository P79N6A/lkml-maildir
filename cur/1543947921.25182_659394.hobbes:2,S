Example output:

page      2bf        2 00000000 628
page       97        3 00000000 628

Looks like all kernel text is in zone DMA.  Second column holds the page
number, third is refcount, fourth is the flags, fifth is the line, which
corresponds to this one after my debugging changes:
		if (!mapping || !remove_mapping(mapping, page))
			goto keep_locked;
