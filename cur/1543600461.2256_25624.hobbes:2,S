Has anyone tried adapting any of the MTD code to allow read/write access to
adapter EEPROMs like the netboot ROM on some network cards -- or more to the
point, HPT adapter cards?
I could wire up an "insmod this and it'll flash all your controllers" module
but that's just too evil for even me to do.
And what's with Linux turning off the ROM on every PCI device?
