Or put them in some slab like code, the slab for which gets allocated
early on when memory is not fragmented, and (nearly) never gets released.
Most of the stuff that actually NEEDS atomic allocation (as opposed
to some of the requirements that are bogus) are for packets / data
in flight. There is probably a finite amount of this at any given time.
