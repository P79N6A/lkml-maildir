Okay I've spent my Saturday trying out git and have created a git tree
with two branches in it "drm-via" and "drm-initmap"
Now Andrew I want you to drop the drm-via tree from -mm and try and grab
the `drm-via` branch of:
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git
It hasn't shown up outside master.kernel.org but I expect it will soon
(unless I need to do something..)
Let me know if you get a real tree, the VIA driver is the latest version
from DRM CVS...
Dave.
