That would be nice.
AFAIK just attach and mount it, and probably dd to/from it, and then post
your fix :)
I think any removable scsi (direct access, not cdrom) media might show a
problem (see recent "USB Mass Storage Device" thread from Jim Beam).

I don't have a machine (that I know will boot current 2.5) with a parallel
port.
I/we should get some removable media attached to one of our scsi systems
we have here (maybe usb storage).
