I found several similar problems in my original test case, please see my 
earlier mail from today where I included a completely rewritten test case 
with buffered output and new periodic logic.
The case attached here seems to try to print the trace without first stopping 
it.  I don't think that will result in the desired output.  My new test case 
addresses that issue as well.
I'd appreciate any feedback, thanks.
