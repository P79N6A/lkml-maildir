ifindexes have nothing to do with IP addresses. If you tell the kernel
which interface(s) you want it'll follow your wishes.
There is not really an IP address per NIC; IP addresses are global per host
and the association with an IP interface just defines some defaults which
can be always overwritten by the user if he wants to.
