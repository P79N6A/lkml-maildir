The problem isn't pulling tags, the problem is that nothing 
automatically downloads the 41-byte tag files themselves.  Pulling 
linux-2.6.git after the 2.6.12 release did not cause refs/tags/v2.6.12 
to be downloaded.
With BK, tags came with each pull.  With git, you have to go "outside 
the system" (rsync) just get the new tags.
