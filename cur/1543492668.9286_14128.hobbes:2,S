right, i understood that part.  the range of the *values* in the random
tables, and not the range of the random table's *index*, is dependent on
the hash table size.

well, i simply set the size of the hash table to be the same as the size
of the random tables.  i think the only problem i caused myself was a
little inflexibility in hash table size, since the values in the
random tables were indeed random, and in the range 0...hash_table_size-1,
as you (and rivest et al.) prescribed.
