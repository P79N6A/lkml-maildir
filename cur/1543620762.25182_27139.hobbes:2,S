Hello all,
	a new ALSA patch for 2.5.4 is available at
ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/kernel-patches/alsa-2002-02-11-1-linux-2.5.4.patch.gz
	I repeat myself but anyway. We are open to any suggestions and
ideas for this kernel integration patch. Unfortunately, Linus has not
approved this directory tree and he is not talking with us at the time.
It seems that BIO changes are over, but he's probably busy enough to
ignore our e-mails with co-operation requests.
