And that does seem to be the long term solution. Most (not all) modern 
hardware has a readable timer as accurate as the tick, so doing a timer 
to clock conversion as needed would be possible.
Unfortunately the interest in tickless operation seems to be mostly in 
the power saving possibilities of laptops. If you could make it part of 
some really sexy high interest area, like real time premption, it might 
get done sooner ;-)
