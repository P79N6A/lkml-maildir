Subject: Status of the NTFS driver in 2.4.0 kernels?

Hello,
I've tried to use the readonly NTFS driver in 2.4.0-test11 kernel, but it
reported me a kernel BUG at fs.c:567. I've searched the archives where David
Weinehall writes that the driver even in readonly mode doesn't support the
Win2k NTFS. But I don't have Win2k NTFS (I have WinNT 4.0 SP 6) and the
kernel still reports this bug :-(. The driver from 2.2.17 kernel seems to
work fine. Could someone help me?
Please Cc me, because I'm not subscribed to the kernel mailing list. (Or
don't if you don't want to because I read the archives regularly. :-))
Thanks,
Tomas Mraz
