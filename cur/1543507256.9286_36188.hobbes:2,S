 The problem exists in remote executions too. 
 A simple script containing:
rsh 10.0.0.1 ls
rsh 10.0.0.1 ls
rsh 10.0.0.1 ls
 ceases to work after 10 or 12 invocations. The error message is still 
"poll: protocol failure in circuit setup"
 This seems to be happening faster when the rshs are run concurrently by 
using & to start them.
