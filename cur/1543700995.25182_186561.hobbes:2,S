The synaptics kernel driver doesn't try to recognize alps touchpads.
However, in the XFree86 driver
        
http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/touchpad/index.html
there is a kernel patch (alps.patch) that makes the kernel recognize
alps touchpads and generate data compatible with the XFree86 synaptics
driver.
It doesn't work perfectly though, at least not for some hardware. The
problem seems to be how to interpret the gesture bit in the alps mouse
packets. Unfortunately I can't debug this problem myself, because I
don't have the hardware and there doesn't seem to be any public
documentation available for alps touchpads.
