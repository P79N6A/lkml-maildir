It is not potential, it exists, it works (no "meta-data only" or
performance tuning yet).  Ext3 is simply ext2+journaling.  It is very low
risk to try it out as you can easily go back to ext2.  I dare say that 95%
of the Linux boxes out there currently run ext2.  Once ext3 releases, it
provides an easy in place upgrade of functionality without the trouble of
nuking your current filesystem, creating new XYZ filesystem, and restoring
your data.
I converted a 25GB ext2 filesystem to ext3 and back to ext2 without
problems.
