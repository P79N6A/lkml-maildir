The cdrecord man page says this:
	Setting the -immed flag will request the command to return immediately while
	the operation proceeds in background, making the bus usable for the other
	devices and avoiding the system freeze.  This is an experimental feature which
	may work or not, depending on the model of the CD/DVD writer.  A correct 
	solution would be to set up a correct cabling but there seem to be notebooks
	around that have been set up the wrong way by the manufacturer.  As it is
	impossible to fix this problem in notebooks, the -immed option has been added.
It how can the bus run the command sent on the device 'in the background' when
it can only process _one_ request at a time?
To me it sound like the foreground process (cdrecord) fork()s a process to blank
the CD-RW. Clear. But you said the bus is not able to do so... I'm not getting
this.
