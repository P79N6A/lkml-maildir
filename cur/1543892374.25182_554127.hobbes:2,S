So I did some more digging, got my ultra5 running and I can't
get it to work with both 2.6.20 and 2.6.22-rc4 :-)  This is
with xorg-7.2, and they both fail with:
xf86MapPciMem: Could not mmap ...
which I assume is the error you're seeing.
Investigation reveals that X.org is erroneously trying to
do PCI mmap ioctl()'s on /sys/bus/pci/devices/*/config
files which is very very wrong.  Again this happens for me
with both 2.6.20 and 2.6.22
Can you just quickly strace "Xorg" startup in the working
and non-working case?  Just a simple:
	strace -o x.log Xorg
would for both cases be fine.
You can email it to me privately, and I'll post here my
analysis with the relevant portions quoted so we don't
flood the list with strace dumps :-)
Thanks a lot!
