One of the things I really liked with VMS was the centralized logging
in a clustered system.  I'd very much like to be able to say "give me
all syslog messages for the mail subsystem at this severity level or
above" instead of having to play around with /etc/syslog.conf,
restarting syslogd and tail -f.  Of course this isn't a kernel
problem, it's something that should be implemented in syslog, but it's
just an example of a good idea in VMS.
