The header files in /usr/include and /usr/include/linux seem o be rather
inconsistent. The following code spews errors.
test.c
#include <time.h>
#include <linux/time.h>
int main() {}
gcc -Wall test.c . Lots of errors.
One bypass would be to use any 1 of the headers but a problem is the
following case :
#include <foo.h>   /* This in turn includes <time.h> */
#include <moo.h>   /* This in turn includes <linux/time.h> */  
Any workarounds ??
