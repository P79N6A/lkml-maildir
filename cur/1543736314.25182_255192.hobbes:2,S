Well, this is not the only place where the termios can be changed.
Drivers can change it in their set_termios method, and are in fact
required to do so for POSIX compliance.
IOW, any feature which drivers are unable to alter needs to
"unsettable".  Eg, a port supporting only 8 bit data transmission
must not report in termios that it is set to 7 bit data transmission.
Unfortunately the way the tty layer currently goes about setting
termios settings does not lend itself well to conforming to that.
