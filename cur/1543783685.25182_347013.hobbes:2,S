So that none can see what are you doing? Or because your program is
breaking because of this? Probably nothing, but someone would like
to know what it is you are doing and exactly how it breaks (and, if
you don't mind -
why it breaks).
Actuall, you can prevent a program of being straced (or debugged, for
that matter):
run it as another user. Root still can strace anything, though.
