Most users sure as hell shouldn't be playing with 2.5.x right now
anyways.  With any sort of 'luck' it'll be 6 months at least before
2.5.x becomes stable enough that it will probably compile all the time
again and not have a random fs eating bug.  In 6 months even woody might
be frozen :)

Say what?  Python (with the exception of undocumented features) has been
pretty good about compatiblity.  If it works with 1.5.x and doesn't rely
on undocumented features, it'll work with 2.0x, 2.1x and 2.2x.

Then go help Greg Banks in his CML2-in-C project.
