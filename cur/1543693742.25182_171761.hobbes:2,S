Well, if you add mmap() support, and remove all the dependencies
Netlink has on networking code, and add a non-sockets-based interface,
then you'd have something that could be used by everyone regardless of
whether they have networking configured in.  You'd also then have
something just as 'untested in real life' as relayfs, unless it really
does just boil down to some minor tweaks.
Some other things relayfs supports which I'm not sure (literally)
Netlink supports
- relay_write() can be called from any context
- relayfs has support for per-CPU buffering
- it doesn't require a memory allocation for each packet, so can be
  used in low-memory situations
- relayfs by design supports packet buffering, so can be used at boot time
- relayfs is reliable - the only way packets get dropped is if the
  buffer fills up, but this is addressed by a dynamic resizing
  capability, or by making the buffers larger to start out with.
