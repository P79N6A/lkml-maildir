Nobody asked but, HDD solid state devices that could be used for booting
would require the linking or inclusion of of non-open binaries that must
be executed once the release of INT13/INT19 are completed from the bios
bootstrapping.  We are looking at something that has to be kick started
long before execve("/sbin/init"...);system("/sbin/init"); could be
considered.
Regardless if this is ATA/SCSI.....
Just my thoughs....dump them if you wish...
