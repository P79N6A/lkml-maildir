Only unstable kernels would be changing so fast as to make following them and
keeping systems in sync difficult.  So when compiling utility programs for
those special consideration needs to be made.
However, compiling for stable kernels should always give you a sane
environment.  With debian, are glibc is currently compiled against
2.2.13(well, in potato).
Anyone compiling and writing utility progs for unstable kernels needs to know
that having to upgrade to the latest unstable kernel is not always
possible(1).

1: I can't run any 2.3 kernels right now, because my network card is a
   macronix, that only works with tulip 0.90.  Before Alan Cox added that
   driver to 2.2, I was just dropping in Donald Becker's tulip.c in.  I can't
   do that in 2.3.
