Not exactly.  Different hardware programs those registers differently.
Ie, vga will probably program the crtc regs for 640x400@60.  Your
hardware can probably do better than that. So the code cannot be
shared.  However, saving and restoring the standard VGA regs can be
common.

I meant seq[0] to seq[4] are standard VGA regs.  So seq[5] is extended. 
It's VGAControlRegister in your hardware, it's not used in mine.

If X is running  in native mode then it has to save the register state. 
Otherwise you cannot switch to a console.  If X is running on top of
fbdev, then state restore/saves are done using fb_set_var and
fb_get_var.  The registers are not touched, that's the purpose of fbdev.
If you are running vgacon, fbdev, and native X, then yes, fbdev and X
has to do a save of their initial state.

Not too sure about this. vesa requires real-mode initialization.  Either
you do this at boot time, or fake a real-mode environment like what X
does.
