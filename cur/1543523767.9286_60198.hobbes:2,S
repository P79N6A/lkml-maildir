Subject: 2.2.15pre4: Bad TCP performance (SLIP --> linux.kernel.org)

I'm seeing TCP connections (downloading 2.2.15pre5 here, and reading
http://www.lwn.net
, for example) slow and stalling. Local CSLIP performance
is normal, and it seems not to be overload to linux.kernel.org (going to a
machine connected directly to the Internet I got the patch in a few
seconds).
Last changes in TCP date to pre2, and I probably didn't try downloading
larger files from far away in between. I know this is not at all
scientific...
