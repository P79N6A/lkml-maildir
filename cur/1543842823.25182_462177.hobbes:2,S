Ok, it seems like we might have more than just the missing barrier in
TG3. Possibly some IOMMU problems on some machines as well.
Unfortunately, I don't have a tg3 on a PCI-X or PCI-E card to test on a
pSeries or some other machine.
[Olof: I've disabled the new U4 DART invalidate code (reverted to the
old one) and added an unconditional barrier to dart_flush and I yet have
to reproduce the problem. I suspect a problem with the DART invalidate
one thingy, maybe a HW problem with the U4 chip. Now regarding the
barrier in flush, we'll talk about it later, I think we might have a
problem with the way we do the DART accesses (they might leak out of the
lock) though I yet have to see that cause a problem in practice due to
the round-robin nature of our allocation algorithm.]
Ben.
