Hi Peter,
After running the test with the patch you provided, i observed an oops message
which was at the top of the these soft lockup message and the oops is the same as 
the oops reported at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/24/107.
And when i applied the patch for the oops proposed at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/25/57
 the oops as well as the soft lockup's are not seen.
