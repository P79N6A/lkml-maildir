Nope. It would probably help to enable ACPI debugging, and see if there 
are any other messages printed.
And it would also help to go back to the working kernel (somebody said 
2.6.1-rc1 worked), and try to see what the differences are and what is the 
first kernel that breaks. -rc2? -rc3? or 2.6.1-final?
