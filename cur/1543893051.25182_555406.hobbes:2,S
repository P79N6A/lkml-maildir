CONTAINER_DEBUG is actually a container subsystem whose sole purpose
is to provide debugging information about any hierarchy that it's
mounted as a part of. So in some senses it's in the same boat as
something like cpusets or the RSS controller. CONFIG_CONTAINER_DEBUG
doesn't affect any of the container framework code.

Cpusets depends on SMP in the vanilla tree, so that's not anything new
that I added.

You mean the other way around?

Really, CONTAINER_CPUACCT should have the same relationship to
CONTAINERS as CPUSETS does.
