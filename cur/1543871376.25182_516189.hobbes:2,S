that is correct ...

you probably could get that flexibility by grouping
certain limits into a separate struct, but IMHO the
real world use of this is limited, because the resource
limitations usually only fulfill one purpose, being
protection from malicious users and DoS prevention
groups like Memory, Disk Space, Sockets might make
sense though, although we never had a single request
for any overlapping in the resource management (while
we have quite a few users of overlapping Network spaces)

I don't like the dev/filesystem interface at all
but I can probably live with it :)

for example, implement RSS/VM limits and run memory
intensive tests like kernel building or so, see that
the accounting and limit checks do not add measureable
overhead ...
similar could be done for socket/ipc accounting and
multithreaded network tests (apache comes to my mind)
