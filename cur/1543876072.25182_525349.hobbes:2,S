ok. Sounds good as well. :)

Shouldn't a KEY_IRDA be added as well?
It isn't currently defined in input.h yet, but perhaps it actually should?
Or is IRDA treated differently for a specific reason?

How about:
rfkill -> drivers/misc
rfkill_input -> input/misc
input_polldev -> lib/ (perhaps small namechange to rfkill_polldev?)
It would scatter the components a bit, but since each of those modules
has its own specific task this would make the most sense.
And by setting the depends and select fields for the menu entries correctly
it shouldn't be too big of a problem.

Just to get it straight on how these 3 modules would cooperate (before I start mixing things up) ;)
 - rfkill
	- Drivers register to the rfkill module, rfkill 
	- Provides the sysfs interface
	- Drivers that don't require polling should report the events to this module
 - rfkill_input
	- Provides input device visible to userspace
 - input_polldev
	- Handlers polling, where the driver should check what the previous state was and the driver
	  should send the event to rfkill.
Could input_polldev perhaps not be setup to poll, and keep track of the current button status
and send the signal directly to rfkill?
What I am also not sure of is that input_polldev and rfkill_input both register a input device.
Instead of starting and stopping the polling through the input device it would perhaps make more
sense to either use the input device from rfkill_input and/or make use of a sysfs attribute.

personally I would prefer enforcing drivers to call
allocate()
register()
unregister()
free()
Especially with unregister() doing the same steps as free() (put_device)
might be somwhat confusing. But might be just me. ;)
The remainder looks good, unfortunately I can't test it since the laptop with an rfkill button I have
requires isn't in a state for testing at this moment, and I would need to figure out how button status
reading happens in bcm43xx.
