no - the kernel returned to userspace after doing the 
math_state_restore, and the next thing you saw is the timer IRQ. The 
tracer traces function entries, but not function exits.

same here: we returned to userspace after FPU restore, and the next 
thing was a sys_clock_gettime() syscall ~800 usecs later.
