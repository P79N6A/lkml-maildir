1TB of memory being written to device at 200Mb/sec will take
1 1/2 hours to dump.  That seems like a long time.  I start
getting frustrated at a few minutes of lost production.  Can
you add a feature to only dump kernel pages, kernel pages +
page/buffer cache, or all of memory?  If not, this is a step
backwards in dumping.  We have seen RFPs from some potential
customers for as much as 16PB of memory.  I am not sure that
anybody builds hardware that scales to that level, but it
certainly shows you a problem.

I have analyzed many dumps and never even had the desire to look at
the user processes.  Additionally, some of our customers have
classified data.  They require assurances that the minimal amount
of their unclassified data is being sent outside their control to
reduce the chance that someone can infer their methods.
