I played around with it some more.
With SecurityFlags = 0x7 (default) the server asks for a plaintext
password and the client refuses.  That's fine.
With 0x37 the client agrees to send a plaintext password (or at least
fails to reject the server's request for one,) but actually sends:
<         ANSI Password Length: 24
<         Unicode Password Length: 24
<         ANSI Password: 3577D3557009178AFF455A0F7A99C6585CAEF99C515F2F2C
<         Unicode Password: 3577D3557009178AFF455A0F7A99C6585CAEF99C515F2F2C
(my password was aaaaaaaa).  This fails with error -13 (invalid password.)
With 0x30 the client sends:

and everything works.

That's OK then.  I just happened to notice it when I was comparing
traces of smbfs mounts to the ones from cifs.  Maybe the manpage should
mention this difference for those who are converting, though.
