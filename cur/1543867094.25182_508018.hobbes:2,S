Right, I'm not arging that the lesser includes the greater but that the greater includes the lesser. If you are authorized to remove the door, you can certainly open it with the key. If you don't have the key, and you are authorized to remove the door, you can certainly circumvent it with a crowbar in order to remove it.
Authorization to remove a security mechanism entirely makes it impossible to circumvent it. There is nothing you are not allowed to do that the security mechanism stops you from doing.

Patents are not license restrictions either. The GPL is really clear, if a law restricts GPL rights, you have to modify the program so that the law doesn't apply. Otherwise, you can't distribute it.
There will always be laws that impose some restrictions on what you can do with software. You cannot modify the kernel to send death threats to elected officials of various governments. I don't think it's meaningful to compare this to a scheme specifically designed to invoke a law to make it difficult to do specific things that would otherwise not be difficult.

You are showing an example where the lesser doesn't include the greater. Nobody is arguing that. I am arguing the greater includes the lesser. If you have the right to *remove* a door, you can pick the lock to get to the hinges.
If you are authorized to remove a security system, you cannot circumvent it.

All DRM schemes just reduce the value of the copy. Some of the copies made might still be legal. That doesn't change anything.

No, no no. The whole point of these schemes is they affect legal copies as well. These schemes have no way to determine whether a particular copy is lawful or unlawful.
For example, suppose I download some music with DRM onto a USB flash key. I pay for the song, and the copy on the USB key is my only copy. If I take the key to another machine where I don't have any licenses, my breaking the DRM scheme to play the song is still circumvention. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the legal status of the copy.
> You can legally copy the kernel though.  Or modify it.
You can legally copy or modify any work, under the right circumstances. The whole point of copyright enforcement schemes is that they don't care what's legal. No law prevents you from loading non-GPL'd modules into the kernel (assuming you don't distribute them).

We are not talking about using a provided key but removing the lock entirely. If you can remove it, you can smash it if that's the best way to get it out of the way. The greater includes the lesser.

I think it's not clear as far as the DMCA goes. It would certainly be an EULA violation though. Whether there'd be any damages, though, is another question.

It does make it harder to distribute and modify GPL'd modules though. For example, if you remove the 'GPL' license tag, they will refuse to load. And do not even try to claim this is a license notice the GPL prohibits you from removing. It is *functional* *code*. If you could make functional code that's also a license notice, you could totally bypass the GPL's requirements recipients be free to modify.
Now there's nothing inherently wrong with this. Any module loading sanity check in the kernel makes it harder to distibute and modify a GPL'd module that fails that sanity check. That can't mean that sanity checks somehow violate the GPL.
However, a "sanity check" that takes advantage of a *law*, rather than purely technical means, is another story. Then it's a deliberate invocation of a law to make the work harder to distribute and modify, and that's what the GPL prohibits. (This is no different from a patent that makes a work harder to distribute.)

Read the last part of paragraph 7. Here the GPL uses the example about a legal process that has the effect of making the kernel harder to distribute. It demands that you refrain from distributing at all in this case.

Yes, that is what the GPL was made to prevent. However, this scheme tries to force even code that is not distributed to be placed under the GPL.

The analogy doesn't work for two reasons. First, nobody has done anything deliberate to make this "printing certain strings" restrict your ability to modify a particular work. Second, it conflates a positive with a negative. Your example is of specific things you can't do in any context which is not the same as specific things you must do in just this context.

I do not believe that this is the case. Closed modules are allowed because there is no legal authority to prevent them.

This is cleverly worded to hide the basic disconnect -- this change makes it harder to develop and use code which is illegal to dedistribute, but *not* illegal to develop and use.

Nothing wrong with trying to develop code that can't be distributed. Or are you saying there's something wrong with this?!

Right, the people who want to develop modules they have no intent to distribute in the privacy of their own home.

Right, use copyright law to make it more difficult to develop and use certain works because it's illegal to distribute them. That sounds like the spirit of the GPL to me.
GPL advocates should be arguing that you can modify works you own to make them more useful to you however you want, not that copyright law should be twisted to make such modifications difficult or illegal.
Reality check -- this particular scheme has *nothing* to do with distribution and treats code that has not been distributed the same as code that has been.
