   If yes, the implementation on 32bit could be a problem. e.g. some 
   archs need space in there for spinlocks, so it would be needed to limit
   the usable range.
x86 would need 1 bit, some other 32-bit platforms would be ok
with just a byte (ie. 8 bits).
I don't like this whole transparent idea just like you Andi.
People should ask for the types they want, if they want 64-bits
of counter, they should explicitly use atomic64_t and use the
atomic64_t operations on that type.
