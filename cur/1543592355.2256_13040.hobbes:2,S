Well, I'm just an interested bystander.  But having read the recent 
lkml posts on this issue, it seems to me that the critical points are:
From the point of view of the kernel, the firmware code is just a big
magic number that "turns on" the firmware.  
The kernel is not _linked_ _with_ the firmware code.
The kernel doesn't even _exec_ the firmware.
The firmware code can be used, unmodified, in other operating systems.
The firmware code does not run in the same address space as the kernel.
In principle, and maybe in practice, that firmware code might be running
on a different processor, with different RAM, and a different instruction
set.  
It's obviously not part of the kernel!
