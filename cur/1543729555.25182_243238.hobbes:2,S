This looks good, however I'd like you to make spacing more kernel-like,
for example here:
> +			writel( 0x3f, op_reg_base + EHCI_USBSTS);
> +			udelay( delta);
Also, the double star has to go:
 /**
  * foo
  */
It might confuse scripts which generate Docbook manuals.
Once you're done, we only have to wait for Greg to get back from
vacation, pipe through him into -mm and have someone actually
testing it on the IBM's Itanium NUMA for confirmation that it
actually worked. Only then Linus will take it, and I'll take it
for Marcelo. Kind of long way, but there you have it...
I'll feed it to Dell people too, I know they suffered from it.
BTW, why is that you awarded EHCI its own function, but not UHCI or OHCI?
