And the other one, implementing the ATK0110 quirk.
The same probably could be easy done now with video_detect.c.
The video device HID should get added in scan.c again as suggested by Bjorn.
Then the video_detect.c can go into quirks.c and get deleted.
What do you think?

ACPI: Set enforce_resources to strict if a ATK0110 device is found in namespace
ATK0110 acpi driver on ASUS boards touches the hwmon HW via ACPI functions.
Every native hwmon driver which tries to acquire resources which are already
defined as OperationRegions will not load on these boards by default.
This avoids interference between non-atomic data/command register reads
between the hwmon and the ATK0110 Asus ACPI drivers.
