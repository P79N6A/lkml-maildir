Anyone know where Ted Tso is?  He hasn't posted in several weeks.
Alan, will you put this in -ac?  This patch fixes a bug in serial.c
that causes a crash on machines with a ST16C654.

Because the comment was ambiguous.  I don't have the data sheet for
the 85x family so I just wrote the code according to the comment.
I'll change the comment to make it clear.

Thanks.  Corrected version of the patch is below.
