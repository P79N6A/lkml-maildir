The one I'd sent was diffed against -mm, which includes gfs2-2.6-fixes.git
but apparently Linus' tree (I just checked -rc7, at least) doesn't seem
to have merged in gfs2-2.6-fixes.git as yet. There are references to
down() / up() / su_sem / config_group_find_obj() in there (which was why
I had diffed against -mm to cover all the uses of these), so those will
have to be updated accordingly as well now ...
