Second item, which may well not have been obvious from the original. The
change on the mm/*.c headers for the files changes to include the GPL
statement is part of my patch. The code submissions by Red Hat are GPL
and the no warranty clauses are applicable. When you resubmit them
please include the correct GPL headers I added, or a written guarantee
that you will personally take liability for all defects, errors and so
on. Also since you changed the code please credit yourself too.
The GPL no warranty clauses were added directly to the file because they
are suppsed to be there.
