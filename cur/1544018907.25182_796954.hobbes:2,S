Yes, 1 bit is not enough. With 128 that would be enough to encode all
the resources I can think of for existing Itanium, X86.
But then, I think fields would have to be renamed to make it clearer.
Raw would denote a type of resource and the current type field
could be renamed 'code' or 'val' or 'id' which reflects more what the
content actually would be.
As for Netburst, both CCCR and ESCR only use the bottom 32-bit so they
could be stuffed into the 64-bit 'type' field. But that would not work if a PMU
were to require wider values. Those values are part of the event encoding and
should not be considered optional nor attributes. That is why using a separate
call to program the second value does not seem appropriate to me.
