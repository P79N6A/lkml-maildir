Could we then _please_ call it differently to make it visible that
something is wrong. The IDE code has already a ide__sti because of the
problems it causes on other architectures. We should not carelessly allow
generally what is no problem on other hardware. You get lots of hardware
(especially embedded ones) into trouble, if you _easily_ allow a __sti in
an interrupt.
To explain the problem a bit more in detail: basically you have only three
possibilities to avoid interrupts going mad:
- local interrupt mask in the cpu
- interrupt mask in the interrupt controller
- acknowledge interrupt and manage a pending bit.
Now there are systems out there, that don't have an interrupt controller
and consequently it's possible the interrupt has to be acknowledge (e.g.
the interrupt is level sensitive and the driver has to remove the cause of
the interrupt), so if you now allow other interrupts to do a __sti, what
shall I do now?
There are some more (cpu dependend) tricks (like playing with the
interrupt stack), but all this causes suffering in the general case for a
few special cases, what could so easily avoided.
Of course I could make __sti() conditional, but the IDE interrupt again
starts with a __cli(). So what I'm arguing for is, please don't advertise
__sti() for hiding a broken design, make it _visible_.
bye, Roman
