The -r did the trick. Basically there was a bug in pam_xauth where it
was calling ftruncate with an un-initialised off_t length. Hence it
was trying to ftruncate a 34 byte file to > 100 megabytes. 
The ftruncate manpage says that the behaviour in this circumstance is
undefined. I will investigate further to see why different kernel
versions are acting differently here.
Thanks for your help.
