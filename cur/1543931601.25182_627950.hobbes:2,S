Subject: 2.6.24-rc2-rt1 build failure: mod_unreg_security
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

security/realcaps.c still uses mod_unreg_security and 
unregister_security to try and unregister the realtime capabilities 
from LSM.  Those functions appear to have been removed from 
security/security.c, so the build fails with:
security/realcap.c: In function ‘realtime_exit’:
security/realcap.c:129: error: implicit declaration of 
function ‘mod_unreg_security’
security/realcap.c:133: error: implicit declaration of 
function ‘unregister_security’
‘mod_unreg_security’ only exists in the one place and in the lsm.tmpl
I compared the security.c of 2.6.23.9-rt12 and it still has the two 
missing functions.  Was there a change in how features are unregistered 
from LSM that was missed for the realcaps.c file perhaps?
I commented out the unreg calls to try and build, it completed, but the 
realcap.ko had several undefined symbols.

Checking the config I see this is marked as obsolete, so maybe we don't 
care all that much - but if it wasn't just removed, I suspect we still 
want it to build?
Thanks,
