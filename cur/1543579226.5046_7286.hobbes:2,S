This is not the right place to ask (or answer), but anyway:
Make sure you do not use protocol version 2 with openssh 2.3.0, since it
is ***very*** broken, and more often than not fails to receive (and
transmit?) all data.
Try
	dd if=/dev/zero bs=1k count=100 | wc
and
	ssh machine dd if=/dev/zero bs=1k count=100 | wc
They should give you the same result.  If not, you have the broken ssh.
