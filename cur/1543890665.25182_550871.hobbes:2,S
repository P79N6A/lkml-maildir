I'm talking about "the current version" of AppArmor (I mean AppArmor available for
OpenSuSE 10.1/10.2, but I should call "the previous version" of AppArmor
if you call AppArmor in this series of patch "the current version") can't handle bind mounts.
I know "the next version" of AppArmor (I mean AppArmor in this series of patch)
will be able to handle bind mounts better if these vfsmount patches are adopted.
Thanks.
