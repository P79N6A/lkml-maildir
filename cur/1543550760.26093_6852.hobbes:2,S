Okay, it is partly my fault because I missed the patch pre-release to
Linus.  I had several events that to major priority over Linux.
Jeff and I agree now that there was a problem in communication and timing.
It will be backed out and a better solution for the possible exception
that he needs with be worked out.  Some time later today I will publish a
patch and post it on kerne.org
Also I will get in touch with LT about me placing the patch in testing.
Cheers,
