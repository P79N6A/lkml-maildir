This sounds as though it might be related to the issues I see with my 
"glitch1" script, posted here a while ago. With cfs-v18 the effect of 
having multiple xterms scrolling is obvious, occasionally they behave as 
if they were "owed" more CPU and get paid back all at once. I've seen 
this effect to one degree or another since cfs-v13, which did NOT show 
the effect.

I think this is because the shell to read the keypress is getting high 
latency, rather than the process taking a long time to react. I have 
been wrong before...
I read Ingo's reply to this, I'll gather the same information when the 
test machine is available later this morning and send it off to Ingo.
