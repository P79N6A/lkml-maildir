Only if it occurs at a place that is used often. Even then it's
a minor bug, while a race is always a race.

Exactly therefore it won't protect you from reentrance if you do
something that sleeps. If that's the case, you've found a race condition.

But between threads. Anyway, this was an open, if you use struct file
before open returns even the BKL can't help you.

Yes, I understand. But this is a symptom. We should have heard
about it.
You need to understand that people who run UP mostly won't
care about SMP beyond making sure that the drivers are SMP-safe.
This is not true for core kernel code, but for devices outside
the block layer and perhaps some network drivers, that's the case.
So you do the greps and question locking usage on the right lists.
It's quite important, you might uncover bugs and speed up the kernel.
And you need to be persistent about it. Take your time to find out why
the lock is used. Or why it makes no sense.
You should be able to improve the locking situation that way, with respect
to BKL contention and driver quality.
