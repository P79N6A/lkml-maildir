IA64 has similar issues and uses the hook suggested by Hugh. However, we 
have a permanently reserved memory area. I am a bit surprised about the 
need to make address space available for normal mappings. Is this for 32 
bit powerpc support?
void hugetlb_free_pgd_range(struct mmu_gather **tlb,
                        unsigned long addr, unsigned long end,
                        unsigned long floor, unsigned long ceiling)

         * This is called to free hugetlb page tables.
         *
         * The offset of these addresses from the base of the hugetlb
         * region must be scaled down by HPAGE_SIZE/PAGE_SIZE so that
         * the standard free_pgd_range will free the right page tables.
         *

        addr = htlbpage_to_page(addr);
        end  = htlbpage_to_page(end);
        if (REGION_NUMBER(floor) == RGN_HPAGE)
                floor = htlbpage_to_page(floor);
        if (REGION_NUMBER(ceiling) == RGN_HPAGE)
                ceiling = htlbpage_to_page(ceiling);
        free_pgd_range(tlb, addr, end, floor, ceiling);
