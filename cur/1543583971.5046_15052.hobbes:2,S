  Wow, this sounds like this might be the problem.  I just checked my
`.config' and indeed `CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS' is not enabled.  And indeed
I have been suspending/resuming the machine a few times before the
partition got corrupted.
  So, does DMA work correctly on your system after setting this option?
I have now disabled it completely as a safety measure (and as suggested
by somebody else on this list), and indeed I have not had any more
troubles for now.  (I have been forcing a fsck every day before turning
the machine off.)
  Thanks a lot for the hint!  I will now rebuild my kernel with that
option turned on.
