Well, I admit that I'd far prefer to work with you than Pavel, but aren't we 
still just going to reach a point where you say "But that should be done in 
userspace" and I say "But I disagree that userspace is the right place for 
suspend to disk" and we stalemate? What then? It seems that I've already 
wasted a lot of effort listening to requests to split Suspend2 up into 
digestable chunks for review, only to find that they're not the digestable 
chunks people wanted to digest. I don't want to spent my time slicing and 
dicing in another way, only to find that the customer doesn't like that meal 
presentation either.
Can't we instead do what we started to do with the pageflags support? That is, 
look at the files one at a time, beginning with those that implement the more 
primitive functions, such as pageflags and extents and the like, verifying 
that they're implemented ok. Then progress to the higher level functions and 
check that they combine the primitives together okay, and so on. Or (if you 
prefer), do the reverse, beginning with suspend.c and progressing down into 
the details?
I guess the other question is, at the end of this, do you have to understand 
perfectly and completely how Suspend2 works? If not, are there things I could 
do to help? (Straight off, it occurs to me that I should get around to 
completing and updating the Documentation - it might help you a lot).
Regards,
Nigel
