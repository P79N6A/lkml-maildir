Superpages can from a memory allocation angle be seen as a very strict
form of page coloring - the problems are fairly closely related, I think
(superpages are just a lot stricter, in that it's not enough to get "any
page of color X", you have to get just the _right_ page).
Doing superpages will automatically do coloring (while the reverse is
obviously not true). And the way David did coloring a long time ago (if
I remember his implementation correctly) was the same way you'd do
superpages: just do higher order allocations.
