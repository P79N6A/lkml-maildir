If we notify the fork/exec/exit-events to user-space directly as you said,
I don't think some hackings on netlink is necessary.
For example, such packets is sent only when /proc/sys/.../process_grouping is set,
and user-side daemon set this value, and unset when daemon will exit.
It's not necessary to take too seriously.

Does it mean "netlink packets shouled be sent to userspace unconditionally." ?
I have advocated steadfastly that fork/exec/exit hooks is necessary to support
process-grouping and to account per process-grouping.
It intend to be decided whether packets should be sent or not by hooked functions,
in my understanding.
Is it also one of the implementations whether using netlink-socket or not ?

No, I can't agree this opinion.
It means netlink-packets will be sent unconditionally when fork/exec/exit occur.
Nobady can decide which packet is sent user-space, I think.
In addition, the definition of process grouping is lightweight in many cases.
For example, CpuSet can define own process-group by one increment-operation.
I think it's not impossible to implement it in userspace, but it's not reasonable.
An implementation as a kernel loadable module is reasonable and enough tiny.

Indeed, I'm not opposed to implement the accounting in userspace and
using netlink-socket for kernel-daemon communication. But definition
of process-grouping based on any grouping policy should be done
in kernel space at reasonability viewpoint.
Thanks.
