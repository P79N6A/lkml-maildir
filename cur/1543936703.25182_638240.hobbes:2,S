It might be something on my end with managing the lblnet-2.6_testing git tree; 
I'm still pretty clueless when it comes to git.
I've got a git tree on my dev machine which is backed against Linus' tree and 
managed via stacked-git.  I update the patches in this tree, refresh them 
against new bits from Linus, etc and when something significant changes I 
update the git tree on infradead.org and post a new patchset to the related 
lists.  The process of updating the git tree on infradead.org usually 
involves deleting the entire tree located there, re-creating it, and then 
doing a git-push from my dev machine.  I have no idea if this is "correct" or 
not, but I've often wondered if this is a the "right" way to do it ...
