The only other appropriate syntax that comes to mind is perhaps a 
command-line that ends with a 0.  For example, numa=fake=2*512,0 would 
allocate two 512M nodes and nothing for the remaining RAM.

There are.  Configurable node sizes (i.e. 'numa=fake=512,4*128', etc) are 
the major concept and help to avoid the overhead associated with something 
like 64 nodes of 64M each on a 4G machine.  We've seen some inefficiencies 
with scanning through so many zone lists on page_alloc when we encounter a 
full node.  Additional support such as 'numa=fake=2*512,*128' are used 
more for machines where you're unsure of their total system RAM in the 
first place but want to make sure you have the node sizes you need.
