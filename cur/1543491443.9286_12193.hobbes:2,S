Regarding the recent heavy-hitting of linux-kernel by BENCHMARK PRINT
SUPPLY:  Don't just procmail him, you can fight this guy.  He's already the
subject of a class-action anti-SPAM lawsuit being filed by Washington
State, USA, of which I am a resident and witness.  There is no better time
to strike then while the iron is hot.  Please follow this one up with your
local/state authorities and we can get him off the net permanently.  He is
a repeat offender and unless stopped cold, he will continue to abuse this
and as many other lists as possible.
