Actually, we already established on IRC that the lasi700 driver doesn't
need this, principally because the parisc architecture doesn't do an
invalidate for DMA_FROM_DEVICE but a flush and invalidate
(architecturally, if you read our manuals, even pdc is entitled to write
back dirty lines, so it's not clear there's actually an invalidate
instruction we can use).   This is also one possible temporary fix for
the other architectures if we can't get a different method to work
nicely.
