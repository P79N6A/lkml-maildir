You are still running the old driver, not the driver at

I never released a "1.01b" driver in January 2002.  The 1.01a driver was
released about two years ago.  The current version is
sundance.c:v1.06 1/28/2002
The diagnostic program is reading the correct station address, however
the driver you are using is reading a bogus address.  I believe that
that my driver release should correctly work with this card.
