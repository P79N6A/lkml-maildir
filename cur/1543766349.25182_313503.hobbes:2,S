I've been digging through sr, scsi, sata_via, libata-scsi and libata-core, 
littering the code with printk's.
My lack of knowledge on how the kernel handles devices, is really showing now. 
I've been unable to figure out what is supposed to tie sr to the devices 
probed by sata_via. Also, littering sr with printk's gave me the idea that sr 
is not even looking for cdrom devices. It loads, does the basic module __init 
stuff and then silence. Should sr find devices itself or is the kernel 
supposed to inform sr via some callback hook? I could really be barking up 
the wrong tree here, and not even see it.
Enabling SCSI logging and kernel debug didn't really give me anything useful.
