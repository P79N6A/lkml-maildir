Quite frankly I am becoming concerned about the number of patches that are 
queued for post 2.6.0.  It is beginning to look like 2.6.0 might be nice 
and quiet while 2.6.1+ are going to be quite messy as all the things "on 
hold" get put in.
I'm going to do my part by pounding heavily on -mm kernels since that 
appears where all this is ending up.
