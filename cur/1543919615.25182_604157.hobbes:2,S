I'm wondering why we need the cpu prio management stuff. I'm thinking we
might just use any cpus_allowed cpu that has a lesser priority than the
task we're trying to migrate.
And for that, steve's rq->curr_prio field seems quite suitable.
so instead of the:
  for (3 tries)
    find lowest cpu
    try push
we do:
  cpu_hotplug_lock();
  cpus_and(mask, p->cpus_allowed, online_cpus);
  for_each_cpu_mask(i, mask) {
    if (cpu_rq(i)->curr_prio > p->prio && push_task(p, i))
      break;
  }
  cpu_hotplug_unlock();
