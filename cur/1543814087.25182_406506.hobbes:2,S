BTW, I have no idea why the first 1/24 was missing it.  I checked right 
before sending, and it was there - perhaps I forgot to save my changes.  
The second copy turned out fine, but didn't make it to LKML.  Everyone 
cc'd directly got it, but the LKML filter has a ban on the word 
propasition, and being blackholed by it, I merely assumed the patch was 
too large - so I split it up, and actually ended up binary searching 
down to the problematic section before finding the taboo list.
_Every_  problem eventually turns into a binary search.
