That's the part I like about the page-cache bdev patch. It has a lot of
fairly ugly warts, but all of them seem to be really fixable with _other_
cleanups, at which point only the good parts remain.
I agree that the timing may leave something to be desired. But we had the
discussion about fixing pagecache-bdev consistency wrt the regular buffer
cache filesystem accesses a week or so ago, and the fact is that nobody
really seems to have started working on it - because everybody felt that
you have to get everything done at once.
I don't have that feeling. I'm happy with having partial merge with ugly
warts, if it means that you can get to the final stage _without_ having to
have all the problems fixed at one time.
So now we have two _smaller_ merges that will fix two other issues, and
remove all the horridness from the original merge.
