Yes - by now we all agree that CKRM as it is doesn't provide some things
that cpusets provides (though of course CKRM provides much more that
cpusets doesn't.)
Andrew would ask, if I am channeling him correctly, how about CKRM as it
could be?  What would it take to modify CKRM so that it could subsume
(embrace and replace) cpusets, meeting all the requirements that in the
end we agreed were essential for cpusets to meet, rendering cpusets
redundant and no longer needed?
