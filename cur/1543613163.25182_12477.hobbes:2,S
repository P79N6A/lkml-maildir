Hello,
Currently while running on a RedHat Linux 7.2 box with kernel-
2.4.17pre8, whenever I run the "hdparm -t /dev/sda3" command, the 
following error message will appear around 33+ times 
in /var/log/messages as well as "dmesg" .
invalidate: busy buffer
The machine in question is a Dell PowerEdge 2550 with an AACRAID 
controller and 2 x 18GB HDs in RAID-1 configuration and /dev/sda3 being 
mount as / .
Is this a bug in the kernel or is it caused by some hardware faults?
Does anyone have any solution or workaround to this problem?
Many thanks in advance for any assistance!
