David, 
Thanks for the reply. I sense as in many emails regarding this a 
sense of frustration and this is a concern. I am writing to the list to 
try and learn and because I value the experiences of other people. 
As far as my hardware is concerned there is much more to it than 
a serial port and an interupt controller. What I was trying to explain 
was that I would not mind making my code available for these 
kernel changes. Although I don't understand why anyone would 
want it. Apart from API changes, why do this ? The kernel is not 
easily or frequently changed on this type of system. It would bloat 
the kernel and I would expect to have to address problems of this 
nature myself.  However I would not like to make code available for 
the more specialised hardware. 
Thanks
Simon.
