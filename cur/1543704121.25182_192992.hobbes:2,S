Well ... i've applied the patch and downloaded the pre-patched drivers, 
sacrificed a virgin, installed the module loading stuff (just in case) and 
still no joy. 
So i think the fault is not with NVidia. or the patch. Maybe it's a flaw in 
Slackware 9.1, or i'm just too thick. 
I did get X to work with nv, but since i have a dodgy old monitor i can't get 
the vertical alignment right (there probably is a way to do it -- SAX in SuSE 
does the trick).
