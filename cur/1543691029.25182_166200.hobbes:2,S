Forgive me if I'm saying something stupid but, do you mean a special 
case for this controller in ide-dma.c:ide_build_dmatable()?
In this case, should not segment size and boundary be included in hwif 
so we can have a generic ide_build_dmatable() without dealing 
explicitly with special cases? We could initialize to the default for 
most controllers and set the values for the exceptions inside each 
particular driver.
