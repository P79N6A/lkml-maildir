It will probably work fine on all systems, but its not the right way to
go IMO.  Your original implementation was better.
However, I am still disliking the multiple function idea.  Same thing
with the i840.  The only real difference is those defines.
A _very_ simple solution, IF we had separate CONFIG statements for each
i8xx (or at least one for i830, one for i840, and one for the rest)
would be:
/* all the normal defines here */
#ifdef CONFIG_AGP_I830
#undef whatever_define_i830_is_different_on
#define whatever xxx
/* etc */
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_AGP_I840
#undef whatever
#define whatever xxx
/* etc */
#endif
and then, voila, we have but one setup function! we can remove all the
unique i830 and i840 muck...
Is seperate config statements a problem?  We already have multiple ones
for the i810/i815 on/off-board versions...Hmm.
