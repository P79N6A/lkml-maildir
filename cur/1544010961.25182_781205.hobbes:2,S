I guess we should refuse to run threads from different uids on one

It is not only timing. If attacker has access to detailed cache miss
statistics, things are easier for him... I probably should review the
books, but even if code paths are key-independend (hard), you'll get
timing differences due to [data] cache misses...?
Ok, this is getting off-topic.
