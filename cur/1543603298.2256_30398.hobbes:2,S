    Hi there,
The PnP initialisation of my brand old SB AWE64 PnP was not supported by the 
current (2.4.10) kernel driver (I could initialise it by using isapnptools, 
but not directly by the pnp driver).
I patched sb_card.c so that the device ID of my board is known by the SB 
driver, thus allowing the isapnp initialisation by the driver directly.
I tested it on my computer, and I don't expect the patch to break anything 
(it's a no brainer fix)
Maybe you can consider applying it to the next release ?
Thank you,
 /Jerome
