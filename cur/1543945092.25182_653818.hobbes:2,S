It seems this was intentional, see the log for e5f95c8b:
    kbuild: print only total number of section mismatces found
    We have too many section mismatches detected at the moment.
    So silence modpost and prevent the option from being
    set in a typical allyesconfig build.
    Tell the user how to see all the deteils in the summary
    message from modpost.
