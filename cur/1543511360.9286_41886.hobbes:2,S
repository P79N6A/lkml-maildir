Currently I have it as a module, and I manually insert it using modprobe
when I am testing it.  I used to have it compiled in, but this lead
to several lockups when booting.

I tried Leonard's suggestions of adding a udelay(10) to the top of
the ISR, and adding delays to the OS_* macros.  Adding the udelay(10)
at the top of the interrupt service routine did not seem to help, however
adding a udelay(2) to each of the OS_* macros seems to take the problem
away completely for me.  I plan on doing more rigorous testing later
(it was about 3:30am when I tried it, so it may have been a sleep deprived,
alcohol induced, halucination).
I am not competely convinced that the way I added the udelay() call to the
macros is 100% correct.  I changed 
#define OS_InPortByte(port)             inb(port)
to:
#define OS_InPortByte(port)             (udelay(2),inb(port))
I originally tried a semicolon between the two functions, but this caused
the compile to fail (which makes sense since the macro may be used in places
where a semicolon can't go).  Using the comma seemed to work ok, and if I read
my C Books correctly, this should work ok.
Later on I will try changing those to udelay(1) instead of udelay(2), and
I'll try to really test it hard.
