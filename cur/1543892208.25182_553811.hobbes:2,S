Eric originally used process class, but I asked him to put it into a
separate class.  I think that current refpolicy actually doesn't have
any allow a_t self:process *; rules because we already had to refactor
all such rules when we introduced execmem and friends, but that doesn't
mean that there are not legacy policies with such rules, and I'd prefer
to isolate especially security-sensitive permissions in distinct classes
(and we are running out of room in process class).
