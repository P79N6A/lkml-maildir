Did you disabled DMA completely? That would make your disks very slow
and CPU hungry :(
I was thinking more of using hdparm to downgrade DMA to lower speeds,
not disabling it altogether.
If you will find that lower DMA mode works for a particular hdd
(or particular mobo chipset), a quirk fix may be added to kernel
so that it works for other folks, too.
