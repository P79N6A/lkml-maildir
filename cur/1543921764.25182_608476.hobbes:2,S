Yes, a notion of load would be good - but the "load" calculated by
cpu_acct.c isn't all that useful yet - it's just a total of the CPU
cycles used in the 10 second time interval prior to the current
interval. Something that's more analagous to the real machine load
would be nice, and I hope the numbers could be made available via CFS.

See my other email. Yes, I think we need more here, but probably
something more generic.
