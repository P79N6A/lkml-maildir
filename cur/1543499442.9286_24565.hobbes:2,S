Hi,
If you'd like to try an approach which has proven successful, and which does
not interact so much with core kernel functions:
http://web.mountain.net/~tleete/bigphysarea-config-2.2.9-patch.gz
http://web.mountain.net/~tleete/bigphysarea-config-2.3.3.gz
This is the Matt Welsh bigphysarea patch, with refinements and extras by
Roger Butenuth. I've done a little tweaking and added the feathers to make
it a configuration option.
The DMA area you get from this can be adjusted for size as a boot option. It
begins in the bottom 16M  of memory unless your kernel is larger than that
;-)
The bigphysarea has its own simple memory management, so it complies with
your design of two independent memory areas. It is never even seen by vm,
though, so it's unnecessary to persuade vm to ignore it or work around it.
Regards,
Tom
