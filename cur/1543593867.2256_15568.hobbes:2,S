Yes. But, even if I know how to program the mchip to output to
the video bus, there is something missing to enable overlay
(either in the mchip or in the ati video driver).

I started with that one and abandoned it later, since it is really
targeted to _tv_ capture cards only (the size of capture can be only 
the PAL/NTSC size, and many other little things, like framerate 
fixed to PAL/NTSC mode too etc.)
Maybe video4linux version 2 will be a more useful API for all
cameras / webcams / video capture cards. (almost a carbon copy
of what I say in Documentation/video4linux/meye.txt :-) ).
