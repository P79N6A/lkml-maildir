The source code includes my email address.  Andrea clearly saw it; he
dropped in a similar line below it.  I have done EVERY piece of
maintenance that I have EVER been asked to.  Some software simply does
not require a lot of maintenance because it is relatively simple.
Doing regular noop releases just to assert ownership is childish.
I'm here, my CURRENT email is in the source code, I own the copyright,
no one ever told me that I'm dead, no one ever sent me a patch or asked
me to make a change.
All that said, if I'd simply been asked to relinquish maintainership to
Andrea, I might well have agreed.  Andrea has now actively refused to
so much as send me a patch.  How rude can you get?

If Andrea had even posted the patch, that would have been better,
even if he didn't bother to tell me about it, if I found out about
it, I could look at it and decide whether to apply it as it stands
or to rework it.
By contrast, Andrea
 o  knew my email address
 o  couldn't bother himself to drop me a note
 o  now actively refuses to send me a patch
 o  castigates me for being unhappy about this
 o  insists that his doing so is appropriate

That's silly.  The established convention is to put contact information
in the package.  Putting the burden on the maintainer to say over and
over to the whole world, "Hey, look at me, look at this software I
maintain!" is ludicrous.
...
This whole thing is way overblown, and I didn't mean to make a huge deal
of it.  tunelp is, by design, a small program.  I'm not unwilling to
consider handing it off if that's appropriate.  The only reason I keep
talking about this is that I'm worried about a general uncooperative
spirit here damaging the whole community.  I can lick my wounds and shut
up -- that's what I did for months until the problem was brought up by
someone else and my opinion asked...
