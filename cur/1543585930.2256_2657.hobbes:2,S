Hi all!
Since I upgraded my Alpha-Server (digital alpha/ 21164A 366 MHz, system type
alcor, 128 MB RAM) to Kernel version 2.4.2 (from 2.4.0) (2.4 gives it a real
performance boost, well done!), i notice system freezes. They happened four
times during the last 2 days and i think it happens when a user connects to
the IMAP service (but im not sure). There´s nothing on the system logs and i
can´t connect or ping on network, the ISDN channel times out but isnt hung up
... Additional information can be provided if necessary, but i dont really
know where to look right now ...
Markus
