Subject: [PATCH 0/7] ppc64: Assorted minor EEH cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following seven patches perform a variety of cleanups and restructurings
of the EEH code, in preparation for the addition of code that will recover 
from EEH events.  The frst few patches are nearly janitorial, mostly tweaking
whitespace; alhough the later patches are more serious and actually fix bugs.
These are all small, and should be easy to review.  I beleive that these
patches should not be controversial in any way, and thus should be ready
to be applied.
They compile but (ahem) are not tested, as I just now discovered that 
I cannot even boot 2.6.14-rc2-git6 in any shape or form; it panics complaining 
of "junk in gzipped archive".  Of course, I am of the firmest conviction that
my patches are spotless, and need no testing, anyway. So there. :)
