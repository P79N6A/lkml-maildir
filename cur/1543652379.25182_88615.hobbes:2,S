Actually, the best way to do this might be to vector the rdtsc calls through a 
function pointer (i.e. they return zero always if the TSC is disabled, or the 
TSC value if it's OK).  I think this might be better than checking the 
cpu_has_tsc flag in the code (well it's more expandable anyway, it won't be 
faster...)
When the TSC code is sorted out on a per cpu basis, consumers are probably 
going to expect rdtsc to return usable values whatever CPU it is called on, so 
vectoring the calls now may help this.
