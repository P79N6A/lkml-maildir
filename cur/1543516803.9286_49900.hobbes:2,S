I think you are becoming unfair here.

You mean, it sets the RTC clock to the system time, destroying 
information? It does if the system clock is synchronized to some 
external time reference source. In that case the RTC is a slave 
clock, not a master clock.

I don't know whether this is true or why it is there, but I'm sure 
it's not a problem of the kernel.
You are aware that the average quarz drifts by 2PPM per °C?

Please think what you want if you set the system time.

The question is which approach pollutes user programs most, not to 
talk about portability.

"calculate the actual time" is an interesting concept. Maybe you can 
explain how it works, especially if a system is up several months. My 
RTC drifts about a minute per week during summer...
