Well I was thinking more along the lines of how dlopen() works with shared
libraries, except that the symbols you are importing will execute in the
remote process's address space.
With this you would incur a penalty, but it should be nowhere near the doors
penalty, I was thinking a few microseconds at the most. Even SVID RT message
queues can be delivered in less than a microsecond on a P2 266.
