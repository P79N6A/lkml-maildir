Yes we had more fun writing the emulation than playing the game ;) it's
still quite slow to emulate every load byte instruction!  I hope that Loki
will soon release a recompiled binary for us pre-ev6 users. 
Although I agree with Alan entirely for open-source code, we still have a
problem with binary-only products (such as Civilisation CTP).  In such
situations emulation can be very useful (even if it's non-optimal).
Please let's not consider emulating in user land .. emulating in the kernel
is slow enough! ;)
BTW, for our alpha emulation patch, we were concerned about speed and not
security (woops) .. soon we'll post another patch to fix the security.
