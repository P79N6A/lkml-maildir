Not really true -- a single system can easily have firmware installed
for b43, b43legacy, and bcm43xx at the same time and switch back and
forth between them.
Given a functioning udev configuration, the persistent naming even
works so that your device stays as 'eth1' when switching to and
fro bcm43xx.  I really think everyone is overstating the problem.
