Hi guys,
I have this problem for quite some time now, but I never really got
around to figure out what it is. I can successfully boot this machine
and get X11 up and running, but when I shutdown my machine it crashes
when closing X11. The system is x86_64 based and looks like this:

The problematic part is the Intel AGP module (intel_agp), because if I
don't compile it the system works fine. There is an oops coming, but so
far I wasn't able to get it out. Does anyone have seen this problem
before and have some patches for me to try? Otherwise I need to try to
get this oops message.
Regards
Marcel
