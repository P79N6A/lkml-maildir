Subject: [patch 0/2] serial: explicitly request ttyS0-3 for COM1-4

When 8250_pnp discovers COM ports, we only get the correct ttyS names
by accident -- we rely on serial8250_isa_init_ports(), which discovers
the COM ports earlier using the addresses in SERIAL_PORT_DFNS.
These two patches remove the dependency on SERIAL_PORT_DFNS by
explicitly requesting the desired ttyS names.
