Depends on how dead the disk is: 
Disk is no longer detected by the bios -> no problem. The software solution
is perfectly capable of booting from the 2nd drive if the first one is gone.
Still recogniced, but can't be read from -> Problem - manual interfention
IS required.
As I concurred before, the hardware raid solution is superior - but then,
there's a lot of room for different solutions and different reliability
requirements - both with regards to financial and technical considerations.

There's a lot of systems out there where even $2600 is too expensive, and
where a software solution using, say, two $100 ATA drives can still greatly
enhance reliability in omparisn to a system without any mirroring at all.
Also, many systems just plain don't NEED 320GB of storage :-)

Same goes for the software raid - disks can be moved around any way you want;

Right on that one, price/performance for ATA Disks is currently really
stunning.
