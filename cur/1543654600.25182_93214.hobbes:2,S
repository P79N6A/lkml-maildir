There are changes to arch/i386/kernel/apm.c in
2.4.20, but they mainly concern support for SMP.
Did you upgrade XFree86 recently?
Does resume work if you suspend with X not running?
What exactly happens when you request a resume?  Do
you see anything in the log?
What laptop model do you have?
What distro are you using?

Are you trying to load apm as a module?  Perhaps you
should wait for the 2.5 module loading code to settle down.
Then write again and provide more details of the problem.

Because Linux 2.5 is a development kernel.
