I confirmed that it (nforce2) needed the acpi_skip_timer_override. If you read 
my mail, you knew I didn't test your patch.

Perhaps I wasn't percise, Len Brown had it in his earlier patch descriptions:
"
workaround for nForce2 BIOS bug: XT-PIC timer in IOAPIC mode 
"acpi_skip_timer_override" boot parameter
"
or
"
Since the hardware is connected to APIC pin0, it is a BIOS bug 
 that an ACPI interrupt source override from pin2 to IRQ0 exists. 
With this simple 2.6.5 patch you can specify "acpi_skip_timer_override" 
 to ignore that bogus BIOS directive. The result is with your 
 ACPI-enabled APIC-enabled kernel, you'll get IRQ0 IO-APIC-edge timer. 
"
This is exactly what I observed on the nforce2.
My kernels are compiled and configured for APIC. With broken BIOSes the timer 
ends up as XT-PIC anyway. That is what I wanted to say and which you could 
see from my cat /proc/interrupts dumps.
Why can't the kernel check for this condition and only activate the quirk then 
instead of current and your proposed broken behaviour?

No, I do understand C code and I know the ID of my board. So I am not 
speculating, just saving myself time and hassle.
You are not even taking the time to really read what I say. I am not your   
guinea pig. Why should I simply waste my time? Esp. my nforce2 system is a 
productive system and I usually don't mess with it. So come up with a patch 
that makes sense (and triggers on my nforce2 and does not trigger on my 
mcp51) in my eyes, or I won't test anything and keep the NAK.
I don't think you did your research correctly coming up with the first version 
of the patch, as it ignored the nforce2 altogether. And the original version 
was made for nforce2 exclusively! So why should I trust that you know what 
you are doing? I don't get the impression. You also didn't gave references 
where you get your IDs in the patch. I at least tried to gave some references 
that putting in those IDs is *wrong*. If you can provide those references 
(and not some "search for it") you could strengthen your point. Provide some 
bug reports or lkml posts where users of nforce4, mcp51 needed the 
skip_override to get their system stable.
I don't care whether this patch has been in some kernel for some time. It is 
still wrong (worse for nforce2 users, though better for newer nvidia chipset 
users as at last the quirk doesn't get appield for them)!
