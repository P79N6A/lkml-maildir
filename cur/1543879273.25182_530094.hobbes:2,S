The proc file system may not be mounted at /proc. There are environments
where this is done for good reason (eg not wanting the /proc info exposed
to a low trust environment). Another is when FUSE is providing an
arbitrated proc either by merging across clusters or by removing stuff.

Why can't this be done in the profile itself to avoid kernel special case
uglies and inflexibility ?

Now there is an interesting question. Is PTR_ERR() safe for kernel
pointers on all platforms or just for user ones ?
