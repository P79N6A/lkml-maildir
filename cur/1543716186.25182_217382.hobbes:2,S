No Linux spinlocks, kernel structures, interfaces, macros or inlines
whatsoever are used in the binary-only proprietary modem code that
is bundled with our drivers. All Linux-related things are fully 
separated
in open-source modules. As I said before, Linuxant is trying very hard
to attenuate the inconveniences of political constraints for people.
Despite this, like any in complex software, there are occasional
compatibility issues with certain configurations since the kernel
can be wildly customized/patched, APIs are constantly evolving,
and PC hardware incredibly diverse.
But we are here to assume our responsibility in fixing and properly
maintaining the drivers as well as we can.
