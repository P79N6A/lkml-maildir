Well, I think this "problem" is way overstated. With a low latency path
the delay ack estimator should already take care of this. With a high
latency path you're out of luck in any case.
Besides, as I said, you can always disable Nagle in an interactive
application. I suppose it would be nice to have a socket option to
disable delayack as well, just for completeness.
