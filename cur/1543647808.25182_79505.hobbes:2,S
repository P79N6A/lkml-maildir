Due we want this per numa area or simply per zone?  My suspicion is that
internally at least we want this per zone.

The API doesn't make much sense at the moment.
1) You are operating on tasks and not mm's, or preferably vmas.
2) sys_mem_setbinding does not move the mm to the new binding.
3) You specify a pid and then change current task instead of
   the specified one.
4) An ordered zone list is probably the more natural mapping.
5) mprotect is the more natural model rather than set_cpu_affinity.
6) The code belongs in mm/* not kernel/*
