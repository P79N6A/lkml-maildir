Semaphores and rwsems need a lot of cleanup. Some time ago we put
spinlocks which are a lot more time critical than semaphores
out of line. So the same could be done for semaphores too. This
had the advantages that most of the assembler voodoo wouldn't
be needed anymore and they could be simple straight C implementations
shared by all architectures.
