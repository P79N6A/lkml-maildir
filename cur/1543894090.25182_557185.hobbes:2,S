Thanks. Obviously this remote has broken report descriptor -- it generates 
0xfa usage code from Consumer page for the "back" key (not to mention that 
it should rather generate 0x224 for KEY_BACK), but logical maximum for 
coresponding field is set to 0xf9, as far as I can see from the dump you 
provided.
I have met such devices already, we are fixing their report descriptors on 
the fly before they enter the HID parser. I will prepare a patch for you 
to test (probably tomorrow, sorry).
BTW this also means that the support for the BACK key can't currently be 
written in userspace using the setkeycodes() method, because this usage is 
currently just ignored, due to being out of range.
