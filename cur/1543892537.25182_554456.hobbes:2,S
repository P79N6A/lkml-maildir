pmap seems to get shmid from "ino#" field of /proc/pid/map.
Its already broken in current mainline.
But, the breakage is not due to namespaces or container effort :(
Its due to noble effort from Eric to clean up the shm code,
take out the hacks to handle hugetlbfs and make the code
more streamlined and readable.
If we really really want old behaviour, we need my one line
patch to force shmid as inode# :(
BTW, I agree with Eric that its would be nice to use shmid as part
of name instead of forcing to be as inode number. It should be
possible for pmap to workout shmid from "key" or name. Isn't it ?
Andrew/Linus, its up to you to figure out if its worth breaking.
Here is the patch to base dentry-name on shmid - so we don't
need to use ino# to identify shmid.
Thanks,
Badari
Instead of basing dentry name on the shm "key", base it on
"shmid" - so it shows up clearly in /proc/pid/maps. Earlier
we were forcing ino# to match shmid.
