This is because the osirusoft.com RBL server has been under attack
(ddos) last weekend. Answers by this server were always "listed"
during this time. This is not a lucky default IMHO but it was like
that.

(for those who read german)
For me it was worse because my exim used this server directly and
did not mark those mails as spam but completely blocked all mails
:-(
BTW: Does newest release contain this rules (*_OSIRUSOFT_*) by
default?
