The absolute virtual addresses are randomized, yes; but do a sequence
of mmaps and they come back adjacent to each other, and so mergable.
Or does your distro include a kernel patch to randomize them relative
to each other?

Blaisorblade's patch, yes.  I disliked it at the time I reviewed
it a couple of years back: it made a system call many of us regret
even nastier, and relied on tiresome per-arch pagetable encodings.
It seemed likely to cause us trouble down the line - though
undoubtedly it provides real benefits too.
I never found time to review it when it came around again recently,
thought Blaisorblade might prefer me to turn a blind eye to it ;)
and let others opine instead.  But I think noone else found time to
review it either.  I expect it's rather nicer now, but doubt it's
actually attractive.
It _might_ turn out to be more attractive, not to rely on that
peculiar sys_remap_file_pages, but make all our vmas independent
of protections, and hang differently protected ranges off them.
Maybe.

In honesty, I should add that I dislike and distrust Davide's
MAP_NOZERO very much indeed!  Would much rather leave my cpus
spending a little time in clear_page().  A uid in struct page
(though I'm sure we could find somewhere to tuck it away) -
the horror, the horror!  But I've so far failed to find a killer
argument against it, and am hoping for someone else to do so.
Curmudgeonly,
Hugh
