I don't think there can be any _valid_ such use.
Anything that knows about CPU's has to use "get_cpu()/put_cpu()" anyway. 
You might add back in the debugging checks that we used to have for 
"smp_processor_id()" in this patch for testing, and if it goes into -mm 
we'd see if anything triggers.
I still don't exactly love this patch to death, but making the cpumask 
trickery go away does make it look a lot simpler, I have to say.
