Sigh. If a non-root user has a process called uhci-control, then they
deserve to have it die when the sysadmin kills USB :) 
If we keep the USB killer script (which is just for debugging anyway) we
might as well kill khubd too; however, we can have the hub driver
disconnect() routine do it instead.
