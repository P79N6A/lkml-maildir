I had posted one such recursive scalable version which can be found here
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/26/73
I remember cc'ing you.
Yeah, it looks complicated and big, but then I did not want to add
another field to the task struct as one such attempt had already been
frowned upon ( I think long back Ashok posted it)
So I ended up writing the whole read/write lock/unlock code myself.
It's a RCU based lock, extremely light on the read side, but costly for the
writers since it does a synchronize_sched.
And yeah, it's partial towards the readers but with an additional field
in the task struct we can have a fair implementation.
Besides, an unfair cpu_hotplug_lock won't work since a process doing a
sched_getaffinity in a forever_while loop can prevent any hotplug from
happening.

Yup.
