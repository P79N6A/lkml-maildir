As I mentioned in my first message, I did hook up
a serial console except I used the console=ttyS0,115200
boot parameter, but the kernel rebooted before any
output appeared. I can try the earlyprintk= version
above next time I'm near the 486 if you think it will
make any difference.

I posted a link to it in my first message:

http://user.it.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/tmp/486-config-2.6.24-rc1.
