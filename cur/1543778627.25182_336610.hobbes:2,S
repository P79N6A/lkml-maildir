Greetings Ingo;
I had to back away from this patch series in order to burn some cd's 
about a week ago, the symptoms were that X got really slow, and then 
hangs, but it does rapidly respond to a ctl-alt-backspace exit.  I've 
since built and tested -28, -33, -37 & am now on -38, and all seem to 
suffer an X lockup, can't switch screens but the mouse works 
normally, when attempting to run something thats a heavy IRQ user, 
like xawtv, or k3b.  I also made about a dozen coasters while burning 
the debian-3.1 14 disk set, finally rebooting to 2.6.12.1 to finish 
the last 3 or 4.
Also, the hangs in kmail's composer are definitely worse, but I can't 
place an exact version number when this occurred other than in the 
later 51-20's on.
Ideas?  More clues from someplace?  The logs appear clean except for 
the attempt to run tvtime.

Cheers, Gene
