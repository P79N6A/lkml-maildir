Subject: [PATCH] updated O(1) scheduler for 2.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/5/20/173

Updated versions of the O(1) scheduler for 2.4 are available at:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/sched/ingo-O1/sched-O1-rml-2.4.18-4.patch
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/sched/ingo-O1/sched-O1-rml-2.4.19-pre8-1.patch
for 2.4.18 and 2.4.19-pre8.  Please use a mirror.
These patches include all included and pending bits from 2.4-ac and 2.5
as well as my user-configurable maximum RT priority patch.  This is more
up-to-date than any other tree, in fact. ;-)
In general, I recommend using 2.4-ac or waiting for 2.6 if you want the
O(1) scheduler - this is not suggested for inclusion in 2.4 - but for
those who care, here it is.
Enjoy,
	Robert Love
