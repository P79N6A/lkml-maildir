But open_exec() seems to be exactly what you want.  The only thing you
need to know is what conditions you have to satisfy for the close, and
they seem pretty simple.  Basically you just re-allow write access and
then fput the file.  You can check out current practice here:
http://innominate.org/~graichen/projects/lxr/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c?v=v2.3#L510
  (load_elf_binary opens a file for execution)
http://innominate.org/~graichen/projects/lxr/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c?v=v2.3#L757
  (and closes it again, having decided not to do anything with it)
