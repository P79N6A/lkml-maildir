I think it is happening.  I just went sifting searching through the archives
on 'oops' and '2.4'.  The first one I found was:
   2.4.18-xfs (xfs related?) oops report
which fits the description nicely.
The race I showed actually causes the page->count to go negative, avoiding
a double free on a technicality.  That doesn't make me feel much better about
it.  Have you got a BUG_ON(!page_count(page)) in put_page_testzero?  I think
we might see some action.
