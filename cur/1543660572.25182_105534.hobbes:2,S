Evidently others opted to not pursue that option.

They differ in most technical areas. Mainly as the *BSD kernels were
derived from 4.4-Lite, and Linux was derived, I believe, from Minux. The
difference grew since they were developed by differing groups of people.
Within the BSDs, the main focus of each one is different. To put it in
terms of sound bites, FreeBSD wants to make kick-ass servers, NetBSD wants
to support lots & lots of hardware, and OpenBSD is concerned all about
security. That doesn't mean that the others ignore those areas; all three
are interested in security, and being servers, and they all run on more
than just one platform.
There also is a lot of polination between BSDs. Things will show up in one
and then get ported to another.

Sometimes changes will apply to all, and a comparable fix will happen to
each. This usually shows up in dealing with security advisories, but
happens in other places too. For the most part though, what the BSDs need
is different from what Linux needs, or at least the expertise doesn't
overlap.

No, I don't forsee merging. der Mouse pointed out the GPL issue, which is
one where I think the BSD and Linux folks will just agree to disagree.
Take care,
