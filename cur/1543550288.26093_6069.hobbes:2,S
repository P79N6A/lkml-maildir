Which still makes it an broken, experimental, unreleased and unofficial
compiler, with all the consequences I said.

Not true, but even if it were, 2.95 is compatible to all other
distributions, a fine point easy to overlook. And the next gcc release
will be worse, so where is the logic behind choosing a compiler not
compatibly to ANYTHING, except if trying to orce customers to stick to
redhat?

You somehow miss the relations, unfortunately. The usb code if
self-contained and does not affect every program compiled with it.

Same here.

Indeed. So why does redhat so a remarkably *bad* job at the same? SuSE for
example did *not* make their distribution incompatible to all others to
try to tie customers to them.

gcc-2.96 is not innovative, it simply does not exist, only in the
unofficial redhat version. So the best thing one could say is that redhat
forked their version of gcc. That's not innovative, that's a marketing
trick:
gcc-2.96 (remember that this thing is not precisely defined as no such
release exists) produces worse code, has more bugs and is less compatible
than 2.95, so where is the innovation? In copying marketing tricks from
other companies? Very innovative for a gnu/linux company indeed.

It would be better than a world where I cannot switch to another
distribution because vendors only support redhat and the binaries will not
run on the "competitors" linux' distros, forcing me to use redhat binutils,
redhat gcc, redhat libc and so on.
This is *exactly* what is happening with redhat. Comparing this mess with
an usb backport that does not at all cause these problems is missing the
point completely.

Well, if redhat really tried to do this they failed miserably. OTOH, maybe
the redhat people doing that were drugged, because every child could
deduce that using an experimental snapshot that is has a non-fixed and
changing ABI will not help binary compatibility.

Aren't you paid by redhat? ;->
