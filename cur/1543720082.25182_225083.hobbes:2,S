If you care to export an architecture-neutral and/or 32/64 -bit
compatible binary representation of a bitmap, please provide the
implementation in lib/bitmap.c; I'm relatively agnostic on the ASCII
vs. whatever issue. Others may not be...
The cpu count for cpumask_t should be visible to userspace as the
dreaded sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF)...  don't ask how this is
implemented, you don't want to know.
Thanks.
