Hi.
More than 2 years ago I wrote a small non-portable patch [1] to gather
some statistics
about keyboard usage[2] ( I show the counters with modulo 10 but still this is a
security risk. Perhaps some random noise should be added ).

I liked to use this in my PC but stopped using this because I didn't
want to compile whenever I
upgraded Kernels (Debian).
I thought I had already asked in LKML as suggested by Blaisorblade[3],
but I did ask in
kernelnewbies instead[4].

My questions are:
* What should I read to do this in a module?
* Is there a better way to to this? (perhaps using /dev/input/... and
a user-space program) ?
Regards,
Nelson.-
PS: I don't wish to write a keylogger. I really want the statistics
and you are screwed if
someone gets to be root in your machine anyway.
