Reserving low memory space is fairly easy. You'd probably want a different
function to kmalloc managing it (kmalloc is called an awful lot), and
your dma memory allocator could call kmalloc itself as a last resort.

That may work. Someone was playing with it

Its definitely not 2.2 stuff, its a generally hard problem.
