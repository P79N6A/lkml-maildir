When I saw Russell Coker and showed him a demonstration of
TOMOYO Linux, he told the same comment.
Also after tracing an AppAmor's long thread, I'm convinced of the
meaning of label base. That's why I don't think TOMOYO Linux as a
replace of SELinux. "Professional policy (or reference policy)"
makes sense to me.
However it may be safe for audition and profiling purpose.
Policy learning feature of TOMOYO Linux will help
understanding the behavior of Linux boxes.
That is my point.
I will double check the link you showed me. Thank you.
(It's wonderful to receive comments from you and Stephen!)

Yes. But I remember Frank said "don't use it :-)" when he gave a
presentation in Japan.

I'll reply this part in later.
Thanks!
