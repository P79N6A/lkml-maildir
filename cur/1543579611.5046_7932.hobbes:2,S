Maybe I've been off in the hardware lab for too long, but how about
1. using ioperm to give access to the parallel port.
2. have your program write a byte (thread id % 256 ?) constantly to the 
port during it's other activity
3. capture the results from another computer with an ecp port
This way you don't run the risk of altering the scheduler behavior with 
your logging procedure.
