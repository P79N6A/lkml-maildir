UP with preempt.  2.5.66 with the patch you sent still locks up.  I should
mention that I am running two copies of a hacked XFree86 on two different
sets of KVM hardware, but that doesn't require any kernel patches (well, a
small one to the input layer).

Well, I have glibc-2.3.1-51, from RedHat Rawhide February 20, so it sounds
like that uses SYSENTER.  The CPU is an Althon XP, stepping 6-6-2.
