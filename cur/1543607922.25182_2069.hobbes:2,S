I'm fairly sure /proc/slabinfo will show large inode_cache and large
dentry_cache: which is natural after updatedb, nothing wrong with that.
However, unlike 2.4.13, 2.4.14-pre (you tried pre4, I just tried pre5)
seems much too unwilling to shrink_dcache and shrink_icache: your
memory hog should shrink them, but it seems not to.  Linus?
