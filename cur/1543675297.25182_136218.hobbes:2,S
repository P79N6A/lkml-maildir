Hi,
At 
http://www.xs4all.nl/~zippel/lc/patches/
 there is a series of patches 
for 2.5.70 as I want to sent them soon to Linus (kconfig-2.5.70.diff.gz 
contains all the other patches). I only want to update the documentation a 
bit before this.
Changes to the last patch besides smaller fixes:
- choices should be more readable now during 'make config'
- saving configuration into a different directory fixed
bye, Roman
