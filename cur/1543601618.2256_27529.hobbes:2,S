Just a note: This is still a problem.
eventually I'll get a message about task slots.
It's still there through 2.4.9-ac10.
On a new Athlon 1.4 box, with a LNE100TX NIC
it's there with the default kernel from Red Hat Linux 7.1
(2.4.2-2.i686.rpm), and on a P4-1.8GHz with the same NIC.
The servers are Solaris8 and Solaris-2.6, Sparc machines, and the config
hasn't changed in over a year on the 2.6 boxes.
Anorthe system with RHL-6.2 (2.2.14-5 kernel and eepro100 NIC)
has no trouble talking to the servers.
What/how do I set debugging code on the 2.4 kernels to trak
down this problem? It makes NFS mounted home dirs unusable.
