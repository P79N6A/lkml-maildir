Could you explain to me, in nice easy steps, how you got the  
measurement?
Specifically what triggered the 'start' of your time slice?
BTW, where you using hi resolution timers?
You say the max latency was 512usecs. What were the mean and mode?
(Regarding Hard Real Time, my understanding is that that depends on a  
_guarantee_ that the system will always be able to produce the  
'result' within the required interval. Ingo's -rt patches may give  
exceedingly good responsiveness but they offer no guarantees, so they  
cannot be considered Hard Real Time)
