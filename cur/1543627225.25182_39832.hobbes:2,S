Having block devices depend on raid modules isn't the solution.
A user may have many block devices with raid on only a few
of them.
I think this sort of setup-specific dependencies belong in userspace,
i.e. /etc/conf.modules:
pre-install <block-driver-with-raid-partitions> insmod
<raid-modules-needed>
