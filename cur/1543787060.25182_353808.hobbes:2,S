You make several good points.  How about:
  * Rename __GFP_USER to __GFP_EASYRCLM
  * Shift the two __GFP_*RCLM flags up to 0x80000u and 0x100000u
  * Leave __GFP_BITS_SHIFT at the 21 in your patch (and fix its comment)
    (or should we go up the next nibble, to 24?).
This results in the two key GFP defines being:
#define __GFP_EASYRCLM  0x80000u /* Easily reclaimed user or buffer page */
#define __GFP_KERNRCLM 0x100000u /* Reclaimable kernel page */
