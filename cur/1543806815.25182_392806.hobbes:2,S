For the record, so-called Mixed Mode discs consisting of
  Session 1 >>
    Track 1 (Data)
    Track 2 (Audio)
    Track 3 (Audio)
    ...
exist(ed) quite a lot, when games were smaller than the audio. (Now that we 
have things like Doom3 and Ogg, this has sadfully turned around.) To name 
two of such mixedmode CDs from "popular games":
  Microsoft Fury3 and MechWarrior2 (Matrox Mystique W95 Edition)
The other type of "mixed-mode" CDs are the so-called "CD Extra", which is:
  Session 1 >>
    Track 1 (Audio)
    Track 2 (Audio)
    ...
  Session 2 >>
    Track N (Data)
from what I remember, "Music Instructor - Get freaky" was such a CD where 
the iso9660 track had an .mpg video clip. This was done so legacy audio 
players don't play all the fizzle (cat /dev/cdrom >/dev/dsp) through their 
speakers and damage them.
(I tried in the oldest HiFi stuff I could dig up, e.g. SONY UX-1 - stayed 
correctly silent on Data tracks ;-)
