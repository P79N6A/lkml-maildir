192.168.* addresses are not considered "link local", they are rather 
"private" or "site local" addresses.

No extra network traffic, but there is some measurable overhead to 
looking up the scope in the routing table.
One problem is having this type of scheme behave properly by default, 
i.e. in the absence of user specified entries.  Having to create an 
entry for every interface in the system just to get RFC standard 
behavior is silly.
