Try to find a kfree implementation that doesn't need virt_to_page(). 
This is a big restriction of the current implementation: It's in the hot 
path, but the operation is only fast on simple systems, not on numa 
systems without a big memory map.
And it makes it impossible to use vmalloc memory as the basis for slabs, 
or to use slab for io memory.
