The ata_piix driver does both SATA and PATA for the later chips. The
reason for this is that the SATA ICH devices have PATA ports as well
which are closely interlinked in how they operate. Since the ata_piix
driver has to drive those and the PATA only ones from PIIX3 onward are
similar it handles them all.
