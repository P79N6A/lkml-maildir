It is very hard to solve properly and efficiently. When you search the
list archives you will find long threads about the problem
(search for "TSC" and gettimeofday and perhaps HPET or cyclone). Last one 
was one or two weeks ago.
The problem has been there always in some way in linux, now it is just
exposed in LTP because it tests for it.
