This is correct.  'make dep' needs to visit $(ALL_SUB_DIRS) so that if
you change your configuration, the dependency files are still correct.
scripts/mkdep is super fast, and it works properly even if the source
file includes header files that don't exist on your architecture, like
<asm/prom.h> in drivers/macintosh/adb.c.
You only get a problem if you turn CONFIG_MODVERSIONS on.  Then it
tries to genksym files that aren't in your configuration and cpp
gives error messages.  But 'make' ignores the errors so 'make dep'
staggers to completion.
