If you announced a change in policy for accepting 2.4 patches,
then I missed it.  So I'm assuming that since people are still
complaining to me about bugs in 2.4, and we're all still fixing
those bugs, that I should continue to submit those patches to you.
I understand that we should not add any new features to 2.4,
and that we should not undertake any significant code cleanups
because the tolerance for risk is low.
For these reasons, the ACPI code in 2.6 is starting to diverge
from 2.4.  However, large parts of the ACPI sub-system, such
as the core intepreter and most of the configuration code,
are very much the same betwen 2.4 and 2.6.  For this reason
I think the risk is low to integrate some relatively large
ACPI patches into 2.4 -- as long as the same code has already
been tested and released in 2.6.
So I can delay sending 2.4 patches until it is clear that they
were successful in 2.6.  The question I have is how long there
will be a 2.4 release available for accepting those patches.
