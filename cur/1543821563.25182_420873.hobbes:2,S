Actually, I narrowed it down to
"CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC". When it isn't compiled in, all
is well.
(Yes it wasn't there in my minimal .config either. And
yes, my BIOS is the latest available for this IBM P-IV
NetVista desktop - BIOS as recent as Aug 2005, I'm
sure.)
Now I'll have to try myriad ioapic kernel boot
parameters :-( to see if there is a setting in which
it'll work nice.
Any clues?
Thanks
