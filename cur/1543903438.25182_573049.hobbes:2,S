That's OK.  Or generally, if A depends on X and B wants to select A,
then it has to be guaranteed by whatever means that X is enabled,
because "make XYZconfig" cannot select recursively.  Duplicating A's
dependencies as dependencies for B is one way to ensure that A's
dependencies are satisfied when B selects A.  Another way is to select
not only A but also A's dependencies.
That's why I wrote "/shouldn't/ depend on further options" rather than
"/must not/ depend on further options".
But whatever you do, as soon as you add a "select A", you have to watch
if anybody eventually makes A dependent on something else.  Therefore
think twice before you use select.
Also, while select makes it easy for users to enable options, it makes
it somewhat difficult for users to /disable/ options.  So there are also
tradeoffs in usability.  This essentially means that you should never
select huge subsystems.  As I said, only library-like helpers are
suitable for select.
