Really old (early 2.6) or previously with 4Kstacks this used to be
a problem, but should not be with your kernel version.

Hmm... so, your page flags field there (0x80000008) has the 33rd and
4th bits set - 4 is pageuptodate, which is fine, but 33 seems odd
(perhaps some arch-specific bit?  or a single bit error...).
But, the warning is triggered by the page count (16777216 above), and
that is 0x1000000 -- which is a huge, improbable count; that looks to
me like it could very well be the result of a single bit error too.
You may have a hardware problem - try running memtest I guess.
cheers.
