This sounds like the problem I had with the mac68k ethernet cards.

Try it and see.
My personal feeling is that you want to define a macro used for each 
read/write of the ports so that the serial code uses something like
	READ_PORT(x)
and on x86 and other platforms it comes out as the old inb/outb code
and on your driver it comes out as your more complex code with scaling
