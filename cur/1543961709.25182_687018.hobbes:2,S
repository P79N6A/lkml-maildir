Heh, yeah, that's one description :)
"ldp" -> linuxdriverproject.org
It's a bunch of drivers that are currently under development by the
developers of this project.  Mostly it's drivers that are being cleaned
up and worked into a mergable state, but there are some drivers that are
being built up from scratch there.
Once they are in a mergable state, they then get sent to the proper
subsystem maintainer, but getting this kind of build and run-time
testing is very valuable to have.
thanks,
