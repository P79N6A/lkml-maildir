Exploiting it requires waiting for the administrator to change file
permissions...  May be, some social engineering.
But THERE IS a race, which may result in user having more permissions than
he is expected to have.
I'm not comfortable living with such a race.
Instead of
	inode->i_mode = attr->ia_mode;
we can write inode_setattr() as
	inode->i_mode |= 06777;
	inode->i_mode &= attr->ia_mode;
Will it be easily exploitable?  I guess, no.
Will I be comfortable if the code is vulnerable in this way?  No.

I explained my arguments against re-checking permissions:
 - the locking convention where ->permission() method may be called with or
   without i_sem doesn't look suberb;
 - it's better to avoid calling permission() with the same arguments for
   the second time, especially if it does something complicated in
   security_inode_permission(), with ACLs or in case of a remote filesystem.
