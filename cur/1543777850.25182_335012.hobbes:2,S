I have one. I naively thought I could just plug the drive directly to the
laptop without using the wall-powered hub. I'll try that instead. Thanks.
That being said, shouldn't there be a way for the kernel to refuse to
use this hd if it's not getting enough power. I don't know enough about
USB to say, but isn't there something more elegant that could be done in
software?
