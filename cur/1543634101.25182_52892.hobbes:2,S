Looks ok at first glance, although I haven't booted yet.
One thing strikes me: we could move the "flags & WQ_FLAGS_EXCLUSIVE" test
also into the wakeup function - making the "exclusivity" depend on which
wakeup function you use. Does that make any sense? I'm not 100% convinced,
but it would mean that the normal non-exclusive stuff would never even
have to test the thing at run-time.
