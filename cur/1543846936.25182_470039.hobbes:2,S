I think you misunderstand the suggestion (which is admittedly based
on supposition).
On most devices, the MAC address is programmed into a register at
runtime.  It is not "burned-in" to the device itself.  Instead it is
usually stored in some sort of eeprom/nvram/flash/whatever.  The driver
retrieves it at runtime from the nvram and programs it into the device.
In this case, the forcedeth driver is retrieving the MAC address from
a register, reversing it, and writing it back to the _same_ register.
Experience suggests that this register is unlikely to have "magically"
received that information.  The supposition is that instead some
firmware has pre-loaded the register, perhaps at IPL?
It is possible that the device itself is loading the MAC address
from e.g. a serial eeprom tied to the device and inaccessible to
the CPU.  If that is the case, there may be no other solution than
the current silliness.  Since the driver is reversed engineered,
the current silliness (and a prayer for fixed PXE firmware) is the
only good alternative we have.
