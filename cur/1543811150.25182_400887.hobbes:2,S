Heh, I guess I should apologize for being offtopic on suspend2 mailing
list... this was not about suspend2 any more.. 
I guess we should drop suspend2 and this huge cc list from future
discussion. (And fix subject.)
Anyway, Rafael, do you think you could commit your encryption patches?
Ready or not, bugs can be fixed later :-). [I'd like to do some work
based on them; I think I figured out easy way to setup suspend so that
password is needed only during resume...]
