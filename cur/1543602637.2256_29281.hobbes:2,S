virt_to_phys is only valid on the kernel direct mapped RAM area - memory
returned from kmalloc and non-highmem memory returned from get_free_page.
Since vmalloc and ioremap do not return a pointer into the direct mapped
RAM area, but its own mapping, it is not valid to use virt_to_phys on
these returned values, even through it might be a virtual address.
