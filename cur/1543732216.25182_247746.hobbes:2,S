am sorry if its irrelevant here but i have always had this doubt
and this doubt is growing stronger as i see more and more embedded
linux based companies coming up!
How different is a embedded linux kernel from the normal mainstream
one. e.g. I have seen linux run on a mobile phone. When i buy it, am
i not entitled to get the source-code???
thanks,
Prasad.
