I retract this suggestion as it's a very bad idea.  It introduces the 
possibility of starvation via the poor sods at the bottom of the queue 
having their "on CPU" forever postponed and we all know that even the 
smallest possibility of starvation will eventually cause problems.
I think there should be a rule: Once a task is on the queue its "on CPU" 
time is immutable.
