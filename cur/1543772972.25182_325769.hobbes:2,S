Yeah, I thought of that, but it's the same ops pointers that we want to
have called for the different devices.  The only thing different is the
base address of the bus.
In sleeping on it, I thought about just using the void * we have
availble for the bus to use to hold this base address, that way we only
have to look it up at bus creation time, not for every device access.
Of course to do that I might need another callback in the ops structure,
but hey, what's one more pointer :)
Sound a bit more reasonable?  I'll try to prototype this later tonight.
thanks,
