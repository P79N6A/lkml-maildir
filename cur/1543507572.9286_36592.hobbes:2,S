Subject: A bizarre 2.3.15 buglet

Precedence: bulk

I'm running 2.3.15 on some workstations (one at home, one at Tripwire)
and I've come across some interesting glitches with the home machine:
The home machine nfs-mounts a couple of directories from a 2.0.28+logo
server, and after I rebuilt hdparm into one of these directories, the
directory fell off the face of the earth.
Find /Mastodon/Core/hdparm returns nothing, as do directory listing
there.  But if I explicitly ls -l /Mastodon/Core/hdparm/usr/bin/hdparm,
there it is in full executable glory.  I had /Mastodon mounted with
defaults, so I unmounted it and remounted it with actimeo=0, but the
same behavior happened.
If anyone wants me to instrument up a kernel and spit diagnostics at
them, I'd be happy to do so.  (The only diagnostics I'm getting now
are from lockd failing to communicate with the nonexistant lockd on
the 2.0.28+logo machine.)

                  \/                 I can go back to application-land.
