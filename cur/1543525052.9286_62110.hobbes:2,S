I think kmalloc() is the best thing for vgb. Vfb is just meant to be a sample
driver, so the limitation to 128 KB is not that important. It's more important
that you can actually mmap() it from user space, which is not possible with
vmalloc().

I'm afraid there's not much `par' to show in vfb, unless you invent some fake
registers that have to be set up... Hmm, why not do that?
Another thing: to avoid flicker and to avoid expensive PCI bus accesses, it can
be useful to check whether you really have to write a register value. If your
`par' looks sufficiently like the real hardware registers, you can define
    static inline __set_reg(unsigned long reg, u32 val, u32 *oldval)
    {
	if (val != *oldval) {
	    real_set_reg(reg, val);
	    *oldval = val);
	}
    }
    #define set_reg(reg, val)	__set_reg(reg, par->val, &oldpar->val)
and use
    oldpar = fb_info->par;
    set_reg(REG_XX1, reg_xx1);
    set_reg(REG_XX2, reg_xx2);
    set_reg(REG_XX3, reg_xx3);
    set_reg(REG_XX4, reg_xx4);
This is also useful for accel engine setup for accelerated rectcopy/rectfill.

OK.
