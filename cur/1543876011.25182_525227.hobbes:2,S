No they don't, 
First patch does that:
                        hd.hd_irq[i] = (timer->hpet_config &
                                        Tn_INT_ROUTE_CNF_MASK) >>                                
					Tn_INT_ROUTE_CNF_SHIFT;
This just reads values assigned by BIOS.

Hi,
	I feel that you are right,
	You meant that one of HPET timers will be used as clock source and will be assigned some IRQ (not IRQ0)
	
	Seems fine,
	Only one thing: the kernel must assign IRQs to HPETS , relying on bios is not good,
	Also the IRQ for clocksource should be not shared, but maybe I am wrong here 
	(I am afraid that latencies might be a problem here)
	By the way I never thought about the fact that legacy replacement mode  is a 'virtual legacy'
	I mean that it is intended to simulate RTCs and PITs on systems that don't have them, am I right here ?
	HPET spec says that RTC is still requred to provide all its usial functions except periodic freq.
	Best regards,
