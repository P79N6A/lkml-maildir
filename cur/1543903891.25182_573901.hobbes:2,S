You aren't expected to.  Remember that udev and sysfs are written by the same 
people, working together off-list.  They're free to break the exported data 
format on a whim, because they write the code at both ends and fundamentally 
they're talking to themselves.  They honestly say you can't expect a new 
kernel to work with an old udev, and they say it with a straight face.  (To 
me, this sounds like saying you can't expect a new kernel to work with an old 
version of ps, because of /proc.)
Documentation is a threat to this way of working, because it would impose 
restrictions on them.  A spec is only of use if you introduce the radical 
idea that the information exported by sysfs exists for some purpose _other_ 
than simply to provide udev with information (and a specific version of udev 
matched to that kernel version, at that).

When I started looking at udev in 2005, it was a disaster.  My commentary at 
the time is at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/30/189
 and the relevant bit is:

And so I made mdev, a utility which populated /dev _with_ a config file in 7k.  
Greg's upset I didn't just patch udev to remove libsysfs, remove the 
duplicated klibc code, remove the gratuitous database, remove the 
overcomplicated config file parser (with rules compiler), and so on.  They're 
boggling that I could ever have been unhappy with the One True Project to 
populate /dev.

One of my todo list items is to see if loading firmware out of initramfs for 
statically linked devices, before /init gets spawned, can be made to work.  
Documenting how it works under normal circumstances is step 1.
Then again I'm wierd and think that documentation is a good thing in 
itself.  "You want to document this?  Why would you do a crazy thing like 
that?"  Because I'm that kind of crazy?  Because people have _ASKED_ me for 
this documentation off-list?  (Some of the people cc'd on this thread, in 
fact, although I didn't track down all of the requestors, just a few for 
review purposes...)

As I said, I really don't think they wanted it documented.  Look at the hugely 
defensive reaction they've had to my recent attempt.  Kay Sievers is _still_ 
spam blocking my email:

Which it isn't, it's a FIOS that's had the same static IP since last year, and 
I told him about this at OLS, and I've had Greg forward email to him since 
then, but that cut and paste was from a bounce message that came in 
yesterday.  But that's a side issue.
The email Kay sent me from OLS (where I spoke to him in person for most of an 
hour) tells me to use /sys/bus/*/devices/*/dev but the documentation Greg 
posted a week ago explicitly says that any path following the "devices" 
symlink is a bug in the application.  (A document which of course, I wasn't 
CC'd on but was chastized for not having seen at the start of this thread, 
documentation which like the earlier version I _did_ comment on consists 
primarily of warnings "DO NOT DO $XXX".  And you wonder why I start to 
suspect they don't want third parties to use sysfs?)
I asked for clarification about this (how should I find devices under /sys/bus 
without following the devices symlink), but Greg said he won't reply to this 
thread anymore because his feelings were hurt.  Kay Sievers telling me I'm 
wasting his time and too stupid to understand what he tells me isn't expected 
to hurt my feelings, though:

So him telling me to follow the "devices" symlink and Greg telling me never to 
do that are, collectively, my fault.  And he won't tell me anymore because 
I'm not worthy.  Add in Greg Kroah-Hartman saying he won't respond to this 
thread anymore and it's a bit...  frustrating, really.
I have Cornelia Huck presumably trying to help, saying things like the 
following exchange:

Except, it turns out, my information on that point _wasn't_ wrong, but even 
she (an existing sysfs developer) didn't know it and had to be corrected by 
Greg:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/20/66
I'm not blaming Cornelia, I'm thankful she's trying to help.  I'm just 
pointing out that this stuff is hard to document, because even developers who 
think they know it don't.  The fact that sysfs can give me a major and minor 
number without telling me whether it's "char" or "block" (without which major 
and minor are useless) strikes me as a design flaw, to be honest.  This 
ENTIRE THREAD boils down to me trying to figure out A) how do I find (iterate 
through) all the char devices in sysfs, B) how do I find all the block 
devices in sysfs, C) when I get a hotplug event that gives me major and 
minor, how do I tell if it's char or block.  (I now have an answer to C from 
Greg, although he gave it to Cordelia, not me, possibly because she wasn't 
trying to write documentation.)
When I ask questions of the sysfs developers they seldom bother to _correct_ 
me, they just tell me I'm wrong and make fun of me for not knowing it, and if 
I'm lucky they tell me to go read udev or the kernel sources.
Except the problem I have is that I _looked_ at the kernel many times over the 
years (and older versions of udev), and worked out how to do this circa 
2.6.12 and they changed it (by turning the flat /sys/block into a nested 
thing where partitions are subdirectories under the block device's 
subdirectory).  Then I had it working again circa 2.6.14 and they changed it 
again around 2.6.20 (turning subdirectories to symlinks so my strategy for 
avoiding the endless loops broke).  Then they changed it again by 
adding "/sys/class/block" so there are now block devices in a directory that 
formerly contained only char devices.
Plus they added char devices to /sys/bus that aren't referred to 
from /sys/class, so looking under /sys/class doesn't find all char devices 
anymore.  (They _say_ they did, anyway.  I still haven't actually seen a 
system that has one, but I'm taking them at their word here.)  I _still_ only 
know how to find the /sys/bus devices by following the path Kay told me, 
which Greg told me not to use, and resolution on that can't come in this 
thread because both Kay and Greg have told me they won't reply anymore.  (And 
I can't email kay off-list, because he's still spam-blocking me.)
Looking at the code doesn't tell me their intent.  It doesn't get a statement 
from them "this is how programs are expected to use information exported by 
the kernel, this subset of sysfs is a stable API, and it will continue to 
work with future kernels".  I've merely worked out a method that works, but 
they can always change it and blame me for not having done it the way they 
were thinking.  (Even when, like adding /sys/bus or /sys/class/block, the way 
they were thinking didn't exist yet.)

If it was possible to reliably use sysfs (without having written it), would 
you ever be _required_ to upgrade udev, except for security reasons or to 
gain new features?
As far as I can tell, "why do you need to document this" translates to "I do 
not want you to document this".  They consider sysfs, like the kernel 
internal APIs, something that's expected to change incompatibly from release 
to release.
Despite that, I'll post an updated version of the document that started this 
thread when I get back to Pittsburgh.  (I'm funny that way.)  I'm just 
working on other less-frustrating things for a while first.
