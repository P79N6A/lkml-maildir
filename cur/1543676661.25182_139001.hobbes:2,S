If you try to define a bad/horrible "whatever" in an *absolute* way you
need either the *absolutely* unanimous consent or you need to prove it
using a logical combination of already proven absolute concepts. Since you
missing both of these requirements you cannot say that something is
bad/wrong in an absolute way. You can say though that something is
wrong/bad when dropped inside a given context, and a coding standard might
work as an example. If you try to approach a developer by saying that he
has to use ABC coding standard because it is better that his XYZ coding
standard you're just wrong and you'll have hard time to have him to
understand why he has to use the suggested standard when coding inside the
project JKL. The coding standard gives you the *rule* to define something
wrong when seen inside a given context, since your personal judgement does
not really matter here.
