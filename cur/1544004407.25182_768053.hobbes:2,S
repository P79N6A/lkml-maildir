I don't know what got into me. I thought it would be more readable this

I thought that this comment will be like an introduction to the following

I would, please, like to keep them. For the user it does not matter.
Because he is not suppose to care if he is doing:
-	memset(och->permissions_bit_mask, 0, 5); // BAD
+	memset(och->permissions_bit_mask, 0, sizeof(och->permissions_bit_mask)); // GOOD
But for the protocol reader / debuggerer this is much easier since this is the
way he will see them on the wire and the way it is laid out in the standard text.
It was much easier to read the standard text and develop the header this way, complicated
by the fact that OSD v2 was a moving target and the changes from OSD v1. And it helped in
finding bugs. Now to go over all of them and calculate the difference and remove it. I'm
loosing information, and I feel sad to loose it.
But if you are totally not convinced I will remove them?
