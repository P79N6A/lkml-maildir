I know, I was bit confused as I've seen that message before. I've double checked
and found that it appeared while I was fixing some stuff in 2.6.26 release
cycle, mea culpa.

thanks for your answer, it was exactly what I was looking for.
While I was doing that 2.6.26 work I've found that IRQ 19 (sata ahci chip) is
doing some ugly stuff, I've reported that and stopped in half of my debug as I
didn't had more time to work on that. There was some ,,nobody cared'' bugs and
so one, I will return to that problem now and check if it's still present. All
those IRQ problems were appearing with suspend/resume. Nevertheless it isn't a
point here.
