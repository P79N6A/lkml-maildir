Yep, I reboot my machines all the time ;-) 
Seriously you can count it somewhere and present it in sysfs or /proc.
Or log it somewhere else and supply a special utility to show them
that makes it clear that the events are hardware and not software related.
I suppose if your server vendor is serious they will supply a tool
to read the firmware log from a running system.
But printks enabled by default are a bad idea (and a bug too BTW - printk called from 
MCE handlers can randomly deadlock)
