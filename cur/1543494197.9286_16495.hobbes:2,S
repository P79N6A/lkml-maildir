For one, /dev/zero is a character device.  It's also specifically designed to be
mmaped, and is very simple to mmap because there's no real underlying device. 
There's no fundimental reason why a block device can't be mmaped, but there are
a number of implementation gotchas, pariticularly on 32 bit machines.
