Subject: [PATCH] AVR32: Remove KPROBES from Kconfig.debug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/7/106

We already see it from init/Kconfig.

This is assuming Mathieu Desnoyers' "Move Kconfig.instrumentation to
arch/Kconfig and init/Kconfig" patch is merged. If it's not, we need
to include kernel/Kconfig.instrumentation as well.
Therefore, Andrew, could you please keep this close to Mathieu's "Move
Kconfig.instrumentation to arch/Kconfig and init/Kconfig"?

-	  Kprobes allows you to trap at almost any kernel address and
-          execute a callback function.  register_kprobe() establishes
-          a probepoint and specifies the callback.  Kprobes is useful
-          for kernel debugging, non-intrusive instrumentation and testing.
-          If in doubt, say "N".
