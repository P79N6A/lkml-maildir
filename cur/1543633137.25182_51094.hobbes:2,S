The various standby modes of IDE disks are exported to userland via
ioctl()s (WIN_STANDBYNOW* and friends).  For a userland solution see
http://noflushd.sourceforge.net
.  A first stab at a kernel
implementation was recently posted by Andrew Morton to linux-kernel
(June 4th, look out for "laptop mode").  Neither code makes use of
multiple power states, but you could start hacking from there.
Regards,
Daniel.
