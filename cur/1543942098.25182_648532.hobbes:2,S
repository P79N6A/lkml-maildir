Nikon did update their FW for the Nikon D80 and usb-storage got
unusable:

I relized the unusal_devs.h needs to be adapted to 
reflect new FW Version, then it works fine again:

What I wonder is, why are there other examples only reflecting the
newest Firmware, are older ones also catched?
Kind Regards, Konsti
