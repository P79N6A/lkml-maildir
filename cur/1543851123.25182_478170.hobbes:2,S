So you take the old log and replace the line numbers with those of
corresponding lines in new tree.  Marking ones that do not survive
unchanged with recognisable prefix.  _Then_ you diff logs.
In reality (and I'd been doing that for ranges like 2.6.14 -> 2.6.19-rc1)
you get very little noise.
Again, see remapper mentioned in this thread; it really works.
