IRIX 6.2 on an Indy  and 6.5 on an O2
After some more tests, changing the ethernet card in the 2.2.1 machine to
an ne2k-pci (from an 8 bit wd) I'm seeing more consistent rates on the
network (it's 10BaseT) between all the different machines on it. For large
files, the transfer rates are not that great, but that could well be the
fact that it's a P100 with a not-so-good ethernet card. Still, the
transfer rates were noticably slower going from 2.0.36 to 2.2.1 using the
wd card.
It looks like I'll need to get a bit more data before I can begin to tell
what it is.
Thanks for your help,
Ben
