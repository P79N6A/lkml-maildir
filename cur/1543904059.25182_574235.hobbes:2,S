It would create a locking order violation.  Many drivers hold a device
semaphore while registering a child device, so they would acquire your
new semaphore while holding a device sem.  But the PM core needs to
prevent registration while calling suspend() methods, so it would need
to acquire the device sems while holding your new semaphore.
