afaik one doesn't need to do a tlb flush in code that clears the dirty
bit, as long as you use the proper vm functions to do so. 
(if those need a tlb flush, those are supposed to do that for you
afaik).
Also note that your code isn't dealing with 4 level pagetables.... And
pagetable walking in drivers is basically almost always a mistake and a
sign that something is wrong.
