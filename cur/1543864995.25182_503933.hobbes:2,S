Sometimes doing a driver from scratch is much less effort than trying to
reengineer a badly designed and written driver to get it into the kernel
tree.
Also, almost all out-of-tree driver authors know what they need to do to
get the code into the kernel tree.
Again, I've offered my services to many such groups in the past.  A lot
of them do get into the tree, and I'll continue to offer my services to
do this.
But again, that's not the main point of this announcement sorry.

Persistance is everything :)

You are free to use your resources however you wish, and mine how I
wish.  Would you want it to be any other way?  :)
