Try the following patch, and report the syslog output.
This may be lost receive data due to full flip buffer.
2.6.9 would try processing rx data in the ISR if the
flip buffer was full. This violated locking requirements
and was changed to only process rx data in scheduled work.
This can slow the processing of data.
Also try using the setserial utility to set
the 'low_latency' option for the device. That should
operate the same as 2.6.9 (which can be dangerous).

The improved flip buffering code in 2.6.16-rc3
should also prevent any loss of data. If possible,
try 2.6.16-rc3.
Thanks,
Paul
