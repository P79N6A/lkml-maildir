I believe I sent a similar mail to the list a week or so ago.
I'm experiencing troubles with KT400 when built as a module
and compiled in. The exact troubles depend on the kernel version.
2.6.54 will fire up but hang as soon as I fire up any GL application.
2.6.55 will eat endless amounts of memory when loading the module
thereby bringing the machine to crawl.
