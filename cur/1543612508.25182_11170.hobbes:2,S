Tried both. The flash BIOS update might be reading system specific stuff
and then appending it to the new update, though. Maybe they have
separate "code" and data areas, and the the data part never gets
overwritten.
Would you happen to have any thoughts or advice WRT the problem we have
and the proper method of addressing it? Absent a BIOS fix, of course,
which I imagine would be the ultimate solution.
