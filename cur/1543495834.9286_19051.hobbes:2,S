I'm having problems with a new Soyo D6IBA motherboard (built-in AIC-7880B
SCSI controller).  It will run fine for anywhere between 20 minutes to 12
hours and then it will just freeze.  The console's display freezes and it
stops responding to all IO (network and keyboard).  I also have a BusLogic
BT958D that was working fine in a previous machine running the 2.2.x
series, a generic AGP video card (3DImage 9775 or something), and a 3Com
3c905B (another one was bought for another Linux machine at the same time
and it has an uptime of 25 days on 2.2.6).  It's in SMP mode with two
P2/400s and APM is disabled.
