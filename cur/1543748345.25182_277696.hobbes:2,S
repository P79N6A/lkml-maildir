Can you explain from a high level how megaraid adds logical devices?
I assume a management app of some sort sends a command to the adapter
to create a disk array. What interface is used for this?
Does this trigger any notification from the adapter to the device
driver?

This information is all available in sysfs. Have you looked at libsysfs
