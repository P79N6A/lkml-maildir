Hi All,
You've moved arch/i386/kernel/pci-dma.c under your pci subdirectory.  This 
means that it is now compiled in only when CONFIG_PCI is defined whereas 
previously it was always compiled.
This file contains all of the DMA memory manipulation functions (like 
pci_alloc_consistent et al.) which you need for device driver memory mapping 
even in a non PCI bus machine.
I think the solution is to move it back up to the i386/kernel level and make 
it always compiled in (perhaps keeping the name as dma.c, though).
James
