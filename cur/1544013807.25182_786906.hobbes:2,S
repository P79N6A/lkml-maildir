looks good - Jesse, what do you think?
Rafael, i'm curious is this in response to some regression/bug? Did some 
box or driver get confused by us enabling/disabling the GSI? Some IRQ 
flood perhaps?
btw., there's a small observation:

maybe a "pci_has_gsi_irq()" wrapper would make these checks cleaner and 
would make things more robust, should there be any new IRQ delivery method 
be introduced in the future?
