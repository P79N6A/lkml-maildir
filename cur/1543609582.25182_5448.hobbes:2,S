There is now a patch from kbuild 2.5 2.4.14 to kbuild 2.5 2.4.15-pre4,
under release 1.6.  Or there will be once it propagates through
sourceforge.
Apply in this order:
  Pristine 2.4.14 kernel
  kbuild 2.5 2.4.14-1 patch
  Linus's patch-2.4.15-pre4
  kbuild 2.5 2.4.15-pre4-2 patch (2.4.15-pre4-1 was incorrect)
