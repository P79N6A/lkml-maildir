Do piss off.  You know full well what I'm saying.

Oh, right.  "Anyone who doesn't like proprietary code in the tree
can just remove it, what's the big deal?" analog.  Sorry, doesn't work.

Replace GPLv3 with proprietary in your argument and look in archives.
That had come up quite a few time in such form.

Look up "sarcasm".

Again, replace v3 with proprietary and reread your argument.

... but not the other way round.  So in effect we get a change of kernel
license, GPLv3 people *do* *not* get any license changes on their projects.
And you are saying that it's not one-way?

Liar.  I'm sorry, but I do _not_ believe that you are honestly clueless
about GPL to that extent, especially given your claims of participation
of v3 development.  What you are saying is "but your code will be still
available under GPLv2".  Yes, it will.  So it will be if e.g. SCO pulls
it into proprietary codebase.  And you know damn well that this _is_
against the intentions of the license.  Besides, changes to code should
be available under the same license.  The first change in v3 project
affecting both imported v2 code and native v3 one will create a big problem.

You know, we have another wanker here starting another thread from
hell - one about allowing stable driver ABI, to make the life of
proprietary modules more convenient.  The funny thing is, it's _also_
said to be for the benefit of users.  I.e. it's basically an equivalent
of "Will somebody think of chiiildrun!!!?!?!?"

It's not an opinion.  It's a lack of permission to distribute GPLv2 code
under conditions violating its license.

Ah.  Got it.  Nice spin.  "Your license doesn't allow to put your code
under the license we want, you are mean and uncooperative!  Giiiimmeeee!!!
Or be condemned as a Bad Person and an Enemy of Freedom"
