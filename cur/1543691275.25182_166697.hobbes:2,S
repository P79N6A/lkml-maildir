As I understand things (But this is from following discussions on
linux-kernel from afar, not from personal poking at the code!) there
is also a performance penalty for the kernel not having direct
physically mapped access to RAM. We map up to 3G of virtual memory of
userspace, and up to 1Gb of physical RAM into the kernel memory map
for performance reasons. So if I have 2G RAM and want to keep 3G
userspace, I have to use some "highmem" stuff right? 
This will not directly require the use of bounce buffers, but it will
require the kernel to remap regions when it needs to access them.
If this doesn't have a performance impact, why do I have the option of
directly mapping 1G, 2G, or 3G?
