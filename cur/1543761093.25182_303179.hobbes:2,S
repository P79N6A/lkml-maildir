Exactly! I am working on input_dev class that lies between actual
devices and input class devices exported by evdev, tsdev, etc. It does
not have /dev entry, it is just a building block for the rest of the
subsystem. evdev and the rest will be interfaces (as per driver model)
for the input_dev class and will in turn continue exporting input
class devices that do have /dev entries.
