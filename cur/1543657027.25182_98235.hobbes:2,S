Swap problem can be generalized. Let's consider these real-world
example pairs:
* cache/RAM,
* local node RAM/remote node RAM (in a NUMA box)
* RAM/disk
* local disk/networked storage
* RAM/fast solid storage "disk" (USB Flash or IDE built from DRAM)
  (etc)
We have faster storage and slower storage.
We want to swap unused data from faster one for needed data
on slower one. The larger the speed gap between the two,
the more we feel the pain when our swap algorithms go wrong.
Note that speed differences (ratios) are very different:
from 1/5 to 1/1000000.
I wonder whether swappiness should be related to the speed
ratio between storage types? How exactly?
Having to play with tunables is not an ideal way to go,
I hate to think that Andrew's (and others) work can go down
the drain at the very next technology jump.
