Yeah, ain't it a stinker. People complain about klunky features like select, but the
really klunky problem you face is trying to fit into someone else's view of the world
(i.e. API). However, I'm not sure your example is a very good one. When trying to
link to a black box API the obvious thing to do is give it its own thread. However,
can you be sure it is thread safe? I hit this problem several times with NT.

Its more than just a need for debuggers. Asynchronous behaviour means tests don't do
the same thing twice. You are forced to try little everything as a heavy running load
test, rather than run one pass of test data. Most of the nasties which occur in
safety critical systems are due to asynchronous activities. Most of the remainder are
due to not testing boundary conditions thoroughly (e.g. checking tangent functions
near 90 degrees in flight control systems). One of the key design review goals on
this type of project is to reduce the number of asynchronous relationships to
increase testability.
