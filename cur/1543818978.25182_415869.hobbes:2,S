Correction: It actually works after tickling softmac a bit (it's an open
network with non advertised essid, the init scripts are supposedly
setting the essid but softmac is having some vapors, changing the essid
manually a couple of times and it ends up associating).
Still, the dmesg filling up with those messages is pretty nasty :)
