Alan does have a track record of stable kernels, but his tree does have
quite a lot of experimental patches in it.  He does warn about patches that
could be quite bad though (think ide and the recent suspend patches).
In fact, I'm using some -ac kernels in production after it has survived on
my workstation for a while and there haven't been any bug reports for the
stuff I use...
Also, 2.4.18 is the first time that I've seen Alan have -ac patches directly
against 2.4.xx instead of 2.4.xx-pre.  Unless he says otherwise I wouldn't
expect that to happen again.
