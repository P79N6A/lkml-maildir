There are cases where a comparison is only on 32 bit architectures 
always true/false (if longs are involved).
There are cases where a #define is set that might be set differently
under certain circumstances:
<--  snip  -->
#define MAX_VALUE 10000
u8 tmp;
if (tmp > MAX_VALUE)
    return -ESOMEERROR;
<--  snip  -->
These are cases where the warning is just noise. But this new warning 
already found several bugs, there are several places where I sent 
patches for things like:
<--  snip  -->
u8 i;
for (i = 0; i <= 0xFF; i++)
    do_something;
<--  snip  -->
In these cases the warning found an actual bug.
Is there any way to tell gcc to disable such warnings locally?
