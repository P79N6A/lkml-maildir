I've often wondered that myself, as I'm concerned for it to continue
to be maintained. I'm very appreciative of what Adrian is doing with
it. (Thanks!)
I've been using Adrian's 2.6.16 kernel releases on two internet
servers that I look after remotely. One of them is RHEL 4 the other
is Fedora Core 2 (Ensim Webppliance). I'm especially wary of breaking
RHEL 4, and the 2.6.16.xx kernels work perfectly except for the
hald not starting (but that doesn't matter on that server). The stock
RHEL 4 kernels exhibit some awful VM behaviour, with crippling iowait
on that system (mainly php/mysql workload)
