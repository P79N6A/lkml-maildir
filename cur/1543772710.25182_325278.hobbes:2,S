Well, AS should only intentionally delay when it has competing threads
fighting for the disk. For a single threaded io case like hdparm, it
should never idle the drive. It never delays to increase merge rate, or
anything like that - only to increase spatial locality on the drive for
two or more processes accessing it simultanously.
