And this method is traditional for C. We have struct declarations and fn 
propotypes in *.h, we should place extern vars there too. Always.
If you are a kernel subsystem or driver maintainer, you may wish to check 
whether *your* part of kernel has any extern variable defs. Just run this
hunter script in top dir of kernel source:
-----------------------
#!/bin/sh
function do_grep() {
    pattern="$1"
    dir="$2"
    shift;shift
    
    for i in $dir/$*; do
        if ! test -d "$i"; then
            if test -e "$i"; then
		grep -E "$pattern" "$i" /dev/null
	    fi
        fi
    done
    for i in $dir/*; do
        if test -d "$i"; then
	    do_grep "$pattern" "$i" $*
	fi
    done
}
do_grep 'extern [^()]*;' . "*.c" 2>&1 | tee ../extern.log
---------------------------------
Output is not attached here, it's too big: ~100 KB, ~1500 lines for 2.5.1-pre8
