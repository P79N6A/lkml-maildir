Thanks.  Has this actually been runtime-tested?
btw, your patches are in `patch -p2' form:
--- kernel.orig/linux-2.6/drivers/char/mbcs.c
+++ kernel/linux-2.6/drivers/char/mbcs.c
should have been in `patch -p1' form:
--- linux-2.6/drivers/char/mbcs.c
+++ linux-2.6/drivers/char/mbcs.c
I'd suggest that you grab and learn
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt/
 - it takes care of all these
things for you.
