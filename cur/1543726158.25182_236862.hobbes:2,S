Not sure why don't want to use something as architecture-specific as the
rtirq patch. We've been developing the Adeos nanokernel for 2 years now,
and it provides a uniform functionality regardless of the architecture
you are running it on. Adeos now runs on x86, PowerPC, ARM (mmu-less and
mmu-full), and IA64. Plus, RTAI now uses Adeos to run side-by-side with
Linux on at least the x86 and the PowerPC. If you're looking at
prioritizing interrupts, then Adeos' interrupt pipeline is certainly the
most compelling method available at this point in time.
