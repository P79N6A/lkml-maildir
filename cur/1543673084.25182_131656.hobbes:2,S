For 2.5.68, this patch isn't needed, the noirqbalance command line option 
works fine. I'll test it though, for IMHO irq balancing really should be an 
option, if not deleted at all. (anyone who actually gained performance with 
this ? Maybe it only works on cpus that are fast enough to handle all 
interrutps without performance going down)
For the Mandrake 2.4.21-0.13mdk kernel, there is no noirqbalance option in the 
kernel. I tried to contact the Mandrake guys about this, but unfortunately 
their response is 0. This patch also fails badly, and I haven't decided yet 
wether I'm willing to help a company which doesn't seem to care at all and 
uses pre-kernels in their distribution.
