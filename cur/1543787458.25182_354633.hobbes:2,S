Hi,
   I'm semi-sure at this point that the xrun problems I'm seeing on my
AMD64/NForce4 machine (Asus A8N-E motherboard) are isolated to the
SATA drive. Is there anything here that might address that? I'm
currently running 2.6.14-rc2-mm1. I've got this machine headless at
the moment. I can move data reliably using the CDRW drive, the DVD
drive with xine, and I can copy lots of data off and on my 1394
drives. I can run Ardour, Aqualung and lots of other apps remotely
using this machine as a server. When I start using the SATA drive,
read or write, I get lots xruns.
