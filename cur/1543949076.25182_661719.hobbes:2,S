Fixed.  Not that I actually read the page and checked for other
errors...

Yes, this still requires a bit of work.  Peter Zijlstra has a patch for
the memory-management side of it, someone has to fix up jffs2 as well.
I'll add support to logfs fairly soon.

It might, actually.  Assuming your average swap page compresses to 50%,
it means that you use half the bandwidth to flash and get twice the
lifetime before blocks wear out.  Whether the performance gets better or
worse depends on the relative speeds of your CPU and flash.
