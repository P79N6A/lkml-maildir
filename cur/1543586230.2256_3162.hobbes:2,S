Hi Mike,
somebody else on the list already pointed me at your stuff and I quickly
downloaded your multiqueue patch for 2.4.1 to try it out.
It works great! I finally manage to have 100% CPU utilization and keep the
machine decently responsive.
On a two 1GHz pentium box i went from 1300 specweb to 1600. That's pretty
amazing.
There is a bit more overhead though, I'd say arount 5%, when the CPU is not
fully loaded.
What is the status of your code? Is it going to end-up in the mainstream
kernel?
Do you have a port to the 2.4.2x kernels?
In my enthousiasm I tried to port the patch to 2.4.2-ac26 but I broke
something and it didn't work anymore... :)
I havent't tried the pooling patch yet, it didn't seem to make much sense on a
2-way box. I have an 8-way on which I'm planning to bench my web server
enhancements, I'll try the pooling stuff on it.
BTW: interested in the fastest linux web server?
BTW2: what about the HP scheduler patches?
Thanks, ciao,
 - Fabio
