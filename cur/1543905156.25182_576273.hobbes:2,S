Would be pretty great to get answer of someone, who knows if the kernel 
retries on errors.
As remounting fixes the problem, I think it doesn't have to do anything 
with the IDE driver, right? The device node should always be connected 
with the physical device, even if unmount. So the "problem" seems to be 
in the part, which converts "device node" to "readable filesystem" by 
mounting the device node to mount point (ISO 9660 driver?). Seems like 
this part gets restarted by remounting.
So the question is: What exactly will this "ISO 9660 driver" do, if 
there is a read error? Will it mark this "failed byte" as "unreadable" 
and will never try again, or will it try again for at least one ore more 
times?

Thats, of course, true, but it would be pretty interesting to know, if 
the kernel does retrying...
Thanks in advance
