There are various loaders (kexec, elilo, ...) that skip the 16bit code
and jump directly to 32bit head.S. So in theory those could hit it.
But still having the loop only is probably fine.

Then i think it would be cleaner to just open code everything without
any accessors.

The 32bit cast still feels unclean. After all the PTE is not 32bit.
