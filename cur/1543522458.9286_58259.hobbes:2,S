I'm curious to find out if the tagged command queuing problem with Western
Digital Enterprise drives vs. the aic7xxx driver is soemthing fixable on
the kernel end, or if it's something that's inherent in the WDE series of
drives.
I've got a server out in California that would really benefit from TCQ,
but was built with the WDE Vendor: WDIGTL   Model: WDE18310 ULTRA2 Rev:
1.30 Drive.
As would be expected, I'm getting errors when TCQ is enabled under a
2.2.13 kernel, culminating in resets, and occasionally, total loss of
service... requiring a trip to the colo.
Is there any hope in sight for TCQ on the Enterprise drives? 
Errors it's reporting (with TCQ set to 96):
(scsi0:0:0:-1) Unexpected busfree, LASTPHASE = 0x40, SEQADDR = 0x5f 
(scsi0:0:0:0) Parity error during Command phase. 
scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 2522656, scsi0, channel 0, id
0, lun 0 0x0a 02 c0 87 02 00
SCSI host 0 abort (pid 2522655) timed out - resetting
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0. 
Thanks for any info/advice/hope you can provide.
