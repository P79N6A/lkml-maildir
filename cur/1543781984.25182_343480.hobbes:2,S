I've had a report about this before, from someone who was using laptop 
mode -- same error message. Funny thing is, the laptop mode tools 
scripts also modify the above values, so it's probably the same problem. 
Until now I thought it was a Thinkpad hardware problem, because I only 
heard about these problems on Thinkpads, but apparently it's a kernel 
problem after all. Don't know anything about the causes though.
