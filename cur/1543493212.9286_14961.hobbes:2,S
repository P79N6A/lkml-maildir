As I am reading the ZD critique of Mindcraft's so-called "comparison" of Linux
vs. NT, (URL www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2242246,00.html)
there lies an issue that needs to be addressed by the Linux community at large.
Let me quote from the ZD-Net article:
	"For one thing, there's a useful lesson
	here for Linux resellers and integrators.
	Linux tuning information is hard to gather up.
	Yes, it's there. But it really requires
	an expert Linux user to find it."
I am a Linux VAR, and I have to agree with the above quote. It is hard at times
to gather proper tuning instructions for Linux. And although I won't say that I
am qualified to be an "expert", I have been using (and fine tuning) Linux since
the 0.9x.y era.
So, to the Linux community:
	Do you think is there a need to make the 
	gathering of Linux fine-tuning tips an easier 
	task for the novice end-user?
If the answer is "Yes!", then, how best would the approach be?
I am interested in your opinion. As I do not know if this L-K list is the place
to do such discussion (if not, please forgive me), but I do think it's time for
at least such discussion to take place, here or elsewhere, and a concensus be
had (if that's possible, of course.)
*Note* The "fine-tuning" IMHO can be either Hardware or Software, or the
combination of both.
Respectfully,
Pete
