Well so long as userspace never blocks, blocked kernel threads aren't a
bottleneck (OK, perhaps things like nfsd are an exception, but kernel
threads doing asynch work on behalf of userspace, like pdflush or kswapd).
It is something simple we can do today that might decouple the kernel
implementation (eg. of pdflush) from the load average reporting.

Might be helpful, yes. At least separate counters for CPU and IO... but
that doesn't mean the global loadavg is going away.
