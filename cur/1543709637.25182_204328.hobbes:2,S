I don't know if it's related, but whenever I load the uhci_hcd module
on my laptop, or whenever I plug in a USB device while that module is
loaded (sorry, I forget which and can't test it now) - the floppy disk
motor and light are turned on for a couple of seconds!
Now, why would a USB event trigger the floppy disk motor?  It doesn't
happen with 2.4, and it doesn't happen on my desktop machine which is
OHCI+EHCI.
Perhaps the uhci_hcd driver is trampling on some ISA I/O port that it
shouldn't be, which is causing both my floppy motor oddity and your
mouse problem?
