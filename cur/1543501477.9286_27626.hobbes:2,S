Hope these haven't been reported already...
1) SLAB_DEBUG_SUPPORT (in mm/slab.c) does not work on Alpha (or any
   other non-i386 architecture, I presume) for lack of a memchr()
2) keyboard_request_region() and keyboard_request_irq() are defined
   twice in include/asm-alpha/keyboard.h.  The first set of
   definitions (i.e. where keyboard_request_irq() has an argument)
   appear to be correct at first glance but I can't say for sure...

You do{} stuff.  Then it's $done.  Then you die().
