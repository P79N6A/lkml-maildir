  Hi, all. Version 105 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.3.4-pre1. Highlights of this release:
- Unregister SCSI host from <scsi_host_no_list> in <scsi_unregister>
  Thanks to Zoltan BOSZORMENYI <zboszor@mol.hu>
- Don't save /dev/log in rc.devfs
- Ported to kernel 2.3.4-pre1
				Regards,
					Richard....
