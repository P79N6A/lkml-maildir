Not exactly -- each rope (the line that connects the memory & I/O
controller to the I/O adapter) has a limited bandwidth, so the memory
& I/O controller makes the decision which rope each transaction is
destined for.

Why would it be a problem if the attribute is per-bus, as it is right now?
see bus->bridge_ctl (PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA)

Actually, they're sparsely numbered to allow for people plugging in pci-pci
bridges on cards, so:
$ ls -1 /sys/devices/
pci0000:00
pci0000:80
pci0000:a0
pci0000:c0

to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
