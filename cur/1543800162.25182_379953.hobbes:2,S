Does this mean you're holding back the 2.6.15 release until we don't
need to update udev to stop X from breaking ?

Seriously, we break things _every_ release. Sometimes in tiny
'doesn't really matter' ways, sometimes in "fuck, my system no
longer works" ways, but the days where we I didn't have to tell
our userspace packagers to rev a half dozen or so packages up to the
latest upstream revisions when I've pushed a rebased kernel are
a distant memory.
