Good point.  I was figuring that it could disappear when the task 
clearly can't be exiting or setuid'ing while forking.

That _is_ a pretty clear solution.  It looks like there are grand 
plans for struct user, so it might come in handy in the future.  But, 
a spinlock _will_ hurt the common case.  With the atomic incs, we have 
2 of them in the common case and, at most, 4 in the failure case. 
Adding a spinlock will require more lock instructions, which are the 
most costly operations in either a spinlock or atomic op.
Either of these are _incredibly_ small prices to pay in any case. 
Forks are slow anyway.  A spinlock would be just fine with me.
