Subject: [patch 2/3] uml: fix tlb flushing for dirty bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/28/247

Since UML has no hardware support for "dirty" and "accessed" bits, what we do
is to get host faults on write (for dirtying) and even on read (for accessed
bit).
However, we didn't mark the pte as needing host flush in the "TLBs" (which is
done by marking the PTE with _PAGE_NEWPROT), so we didn't actually remap the
page as read-only or not-readable.
The bug affects both pte_mkold() and pte_mkclean(), but in this patch, I'm
fixing only pte_mkclean(), since this could fix userspace-seeable bugs.
This should affect a lot operation correctness, especially for the "dirty" bit
handling. However, since no big failures were seen, this should be
investigated a bit more.
In particular:
* pte_mkclean() must be changed only after getting a program using shared,
writable mapping to fail; it will have to dirty a page, flush it with
msync(2) and then make it dirty again and exit.
* pte_mkold() must be changed only after benchmarking.
I'm still sending this patch, but I'm still resistant on the merge, especially
for the pte_mkold() change. In fact, it has been separate to another patch.
