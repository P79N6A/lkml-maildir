Hmm its really interesting, then it means 3 piece of ~1.5 month old laptops 
dieing for same decease :) or they already somehow defectived (or we are 
damaging them but it sits on my table happily all that time :P)

Yes, seems so (i'm adding Onur and İsmail to CC as other machines owner) and 
here is the smart logs for this 3 seperate machine, its interesting me and 
İsmail runs  2.6.22 (over 300 reloacations occured for both of us) and Onur 
uses 2.6.18 (0 relocation occured for him)
