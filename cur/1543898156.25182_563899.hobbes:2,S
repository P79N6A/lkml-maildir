This isn't really about "more suitable for XFS" but more about more
suitable for sophisticated layout decisions.
But I'm still not confident this should be shohorned into this
syscall.  In fact I'm already rather unhappy about the feature churn in
the current patch series.
The more I think about it the more I'd prefer we would just put a simple
syscall in that implements nothing but the posix_fallocate(3) semantics
as defined in SuS, and then go on to brainstorm about advanced
preallocation / layout hint semantics.
