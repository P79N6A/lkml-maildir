Stephen,
Assume a security exploit of you /bin/bash.
The publish ATA and SCSI program codes have been defined small enough to
push into a shellstack "memory push" buy a clever non-root user.
NO-ROOT involved here 'users.users'
Is this clear enough.
Now if you want to bet you butt on your security protocols are perfect,
GO-AWAY!  Stop pumping garbage into a serious issue.
