So you mean that anything configurable should get into a stable kernel just
because users are not forced to configure it ?
Unless you have the time to add an option "old ACPI / newer ACPI", you cannot
guarantee that there's no risk to break something. If someone has a PC which
needs ACPI to boot, and only the older one, you'll break it. One of the next
pre-releases would be far more appropriate than an -rc.
BTW, I agree that recent ACPI releases seem far more reliable than the one
in vanilla kernel, and I would also be glad to get them in a near future, but
after .20.
Cheers,
Willy
