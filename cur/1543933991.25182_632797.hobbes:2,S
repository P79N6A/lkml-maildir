This always seemed a strange use case to me. If the drive is getting 
read errors, either it's dying and needs to be replaced, or it has a 
sporadic bad sector as a result of a power failure during write, etc. in 
which case the drive should be resynchronized. In either case the drive 
should be dropped from the array and require manual intervention. It 
doesn't seem logical to me to just read the data from another drive and 
carry on in our merry way without any warning.

I don't know the md internals very well, but I wouldn't imagine there's 
a timeout in its code, the timeout would be based on the block layer and 
driver timeouts for the consitituent devices. For libata disks, the 
timeout is normally 30 seconds. After that expires, the disk will get a 
soft or hard reset and the command is typically retried by the block 
layer. If all retries fail the upper layers will get a failure report, 
and I believe at that point the md layer decides to disable the device.
