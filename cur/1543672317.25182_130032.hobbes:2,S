   Yes.  It's a tradeoff.  I think it's worth it at the moment (although
   I'll add a limited printk to __alloc_percpu if it fails).
I think you should BUG() if a module calls kmalloc_percpu() outside
of mod->init(), this is actually implementable.
Andrew's example with some module doing kmalloc_percpu() inside
of fops->open() is just rediculious.
