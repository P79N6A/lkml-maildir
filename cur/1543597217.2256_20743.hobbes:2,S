I have had det samme problem with 2.4.1, 2.4.3, 2.4.4 but I do not use
reiserfs, just normal ext2.
It does not happen all the time but sometimes when I delete a file bigger
than 2GB, the space used by the file is not freed, This space dissapears
from the system and the only way to get it back is to reboot the machine.
No errors, no problems with the rest of the system, the space just
dissapear.
We use to work with files up to 7-9GB and the only thing I can notice when
this happens is that the time it takes to erase the file is very, very
short (under a second) when the space dissapear and it takes a few seconds
to erase a file of this size when everything works OK.
Any ideas?
Sincerely
Rafael Martinez.
