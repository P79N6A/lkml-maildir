Sorry to break into this wonderful conversation, but it seems
I have all the actors corralled in one place.
The fascist US government forced 321software out-of-business. It
was a company that provided software that could copy DVDs.
Does any of the DVD software that you people provide have potential
problems along this line? If so, this is something that should
be addressed, perhaps instead of whether or not the Linux software
opens a "device" or not.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
