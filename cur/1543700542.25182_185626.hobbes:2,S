(It's a 7.0 Red Hat).
It does 
   runcmd "Sending all processes the KILL signal..."  /sbin/killall5 -9
before
   [ -n "$SWAPS" ] && runcmd "Turning off swap: " swapoff $SWAPS
in /etc/rc6.d/S01reboot and I've seen the "Sending all processes the KILL
signal..." message appear before the memory freeing loop starts rolling.
