Dave,
What's a good alternative?  Do we need to keep a whitelist of hardware
that is known to work?  A blacklist is pretty risky, since this is a very
hard problem to find.
What if it was always on, except when the commandlien was passed
(eliminate the CONFIG option)?  Really 'leet hacks could tweak a #define
if they don't like the command line option..
