Fair enough. It's just way too much interface/adaptation work compared to the 
benefit. Especially considering that it would be much easier, and almost as 
secure, with a "relaxed" SECCOMP. And on top of that, it's causing 
unnecessary overhead (we're also interested in those small Linux-based 
handsets that aren't as fast and power-hungry as desktop PCs).
