I doubt that USE_3DNOW is causing the problem, but rather when you
USE_3DNOW, the kernel streams through your northbridge at roughly
twice the bandwidth.  if your dram settings are flakey, this could
eaily trigger a problem.  
this has nothing to do with the very specific disk corruption
being discussed (which has to do with the ide controller, according
to the most recent rumors.).

why resort to silly windows tools, when lspci under Linux does it for you?
