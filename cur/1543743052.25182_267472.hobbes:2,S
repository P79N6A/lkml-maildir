Heh I wasnt implying we should move to staircase to fix our problems 
(then I'd have nothing special for -ck would I?). I was simply trying to 
reproduce that behaviour with a similar mode. As for the choppiness, the 
reports were that it would go away if X was run nice+19 which implies no 
dynamic priority adjustment was the answer.

Assuming they wanted to run everything SCHED_CPUBOUND, yes.
Your solution has quite some merit to it :)
I'll look into coding it later this week (thanks for suggesting I do it 
btw). This ordeal has left me seriously sleep deprived :P
Since we're considering providing a special cpu policy for high latency 
high cpu usage, does that mean we can now talk about other policies like 
batch, isochronous etc? And in the medium to long term future, gang and 
group?
