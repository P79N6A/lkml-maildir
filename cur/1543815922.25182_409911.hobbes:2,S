Let me summarize this a little better:
ptr = module_alloc(mod->core_size);
is fine, but when a few lines later, memset() tries to operate on that same
ptr to zero it out with
memset(ptr, 0, mod->core_size);
I get:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address f8806000
(f8806000 is (in this case) the value of ptr returned by module_alloc()).
I've validated the parameters, they all look okay.  I think the page fault for ptr
is normal(?), and the page fault handler is suppossed to set up this page???
but fails...
Yet it succeeds with a different BIOS and bootloader, is what I'm trying to say.
So it seems that the page fault handler is somehow affected by something that the
BIOS has/has not done, long after the system has booted and been running, with
many page faults under its belt...now I've seen it all...or not.
