I am unclear what purpose the long rant about "[p]erfect capitalistic 
system" handling of software bugs has to do with an operating system and 
applications that most of  get for free, so I'll skip that part.
What governs access to a file is ownership and permissions on the file 
itself, not on symlinks to it (which are customarily lrwxrwxrwx on Linux 
filesystems). This is not mysterious. It's just old-hat Unix.
