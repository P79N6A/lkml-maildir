And now I realized something even more strange: My old acer writer
works just fine with 2.5.70 and ide-cd.
Both work fine when I use ide-scsi. I also swapped the drives to see if
it's a problem with the cabling or the order in which they are
connected to the bus. Nothing changed.
Also with 2.5.44, where I don't get the same error, the TEAC doesn't
work 100% either. Burning a CD-R with it, which should be possible at
max. 16x I get a speed about 67x, both with cdrdao and cdrecord. The so
burned CD-R aren't readable.

Markus
