Correct. Adding a hard-coded manual setting of write_speed = 5540 to
pkt_open_write results in functional operation (at least with 4x rated
DVD+RW media).
Obviously, this particular drive is perfectly happy to try to write at over
the rated media speed if it is asked to. I can't fault the manufacturer for
this, for I generally like the idea of letting the user decide instead of
imposing hardware/firmware fixed limits.
