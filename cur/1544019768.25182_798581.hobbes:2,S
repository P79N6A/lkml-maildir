Something I tripped over recently, that might be nice to change... HANGUP 
events are always reported, and apparently can't be turned off. In 
level-triggered mode, if your event loop treats Hangups as lower priority than 
read/write events, an outstanding Hangup will continue to be signaled every 
time you call epoll_wait() until it's finally disposed of. It would be nice if 
Hangups were always oneshot events, regardless of whether the FD was 
configured level, edge, or oneshot. Certainly we know that the *cause* of a 
Hangup can only happen once on any descriptor, so it makes no sense for it to 
be reported more than once.
