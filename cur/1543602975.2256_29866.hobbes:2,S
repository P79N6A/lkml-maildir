OK, you're right ;-) It turned out to be a race between init_idle and
reschedule_idle, that is a generic bug, but is revealed by the timing
changes that my printk introduces (both in standard SMP and NUMA
kernels, if you turn on serial consoles).
See imminent post for a patch. Having fixed the real problem, I can
now axe that disgusting hack ;-)
Thanks for your help,
Martin.
