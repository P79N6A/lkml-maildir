Well, one reason I don't want the low-level drivers doing the media change 
checking is that there's more to media change than just checking the 
media.
For example, the higher levels want to do a partition table re-read if the
media really has changed. We do have this strange "bd_invalidated" thing
for passing that information back, and maybe that is acceptable. It's a
bit subtle, though.
Another reason why it would be good to factor out media change from open() 
is that I can well imagine that somebody would want to do a "door open" 
ioctl on a device without a media, and we actually do kind of have that 
interface: opening with O_NDELAY historically means to not do the media 
change checks.
And guess what? Because that test is done inside the low-level driver
right now, it means that these O_NDELAY semantics aren't actually known or
followed by most drivers, _and_ it means that the higher levels don't even
realize that sometimes the media check hasn't gotten done at all (ie
because the low-level "open()" is called only for the _first_ open, the
higher levels right now won't even call "open()" at _all_ later on and so
the media checks aren't done later when they should be).
However, your ENXIO point is a good one, and implies that we really should 
have a more expressive "media_change()" function, so that if we'd factor 
out open()/media_check(), then we'd still get the right ENXIO thing.
