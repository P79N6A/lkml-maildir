Thanks Bartlomiej.  I reversed my patch and have applied yours and am
testing it now.  If my system doesn't freeze at all today, I think
that this should be a sufficient (and necessary!) patch.
One thing that bothers me though is that 2.6.5 was unstable in the
same way as far as I can recall.  Since this fixup was not included,
do you think it could have been related to something else that was
fixed in 2.6.6?  Maybe IO-APIC or the "acpi_skip_timer_override"
bootparam maybe?
Thanks again!
