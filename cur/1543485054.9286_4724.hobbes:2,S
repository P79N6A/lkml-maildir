I've written device drivers for WinNT & Win95/98, and for both OS'es
there is a special kernel build with extended internal checks.
I've seen that many linux drivers use internal #define's, but I couldn't
find a central CONFIG_CHECK (or something like that).
I think that such an option should be added.
E.g. it you could write 
assert( (page->offset & (PAGE_SIZE-1)) == 0);
even in the most time critical code paths, and unlike a comment this
line would cause a printk() if someone ignores that.
Regards,
