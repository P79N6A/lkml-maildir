Hi Mark,
I've just upgraded to an X2 5000+ black edition. This model
doesn't have a multiple lock and I tried bumping the multiplier
up, which is perfectly stable, but which causes powernow-k8 to
fail to load. I also tried with the updated patch you posted
at the beginning of october (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/9/224
)
which didn't make a difference.
Is it possible to make the driver work in this situation or does
a non-standard multipler inherently mean that powernow stops
working?
Thanks,
--phil
