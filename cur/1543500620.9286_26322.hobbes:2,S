Indeed you are right the stock partial_write code seems fine too.
The whole story is this: When pre-2.3.9-2 gone out the Uptodate thing was
buggy if I remeber well (and lilo wasn't working). So at that time I
rewrote the partial_write function to also do only one copy_from_user even
if we was writing to many buffers and I was doing the bzero (in the case
of a new created buffer) only on the part not touched from the
copy_from_user() (not on the whole b_data). (I didn't posted the patch
because before getting something of working I had to fix also all my
pagemap-lru code that now seems finally stable again btw).
Everything worked fine until I merged pre-2.3.9-3. At that point I
rejected my partial_write code and I merged the stock partial_write (that
looked cleaner, since to do the whole copy_from_user I had to do some ugly
trick). But the real problem is been that after merging the plain
pre-2.3.9-3 partial_write code, I rebooted and lilo started corrupting the
mbr again (or the map file, I don't know) exactly as it was happening to
me in pre-2.3.7-2 (before I rewrote partial_write). Then I thought such
uptodate-bug wasn't been fixed yet. So I rewrote the "partial/uptodate"
logic in the stright way, then I rebooted and lilo returned to work fine
(that's why I was so sure the old was buggy). In my previous code I was
using one variable with the same name "partial" in a completly different
manner (that's probably the reason for which I misunderstood the code and
I instant-thought "ah but here the code is plain wrong"). But you are
right, thinking twice my changes in partial_write should make no one
difference (they aren't wrong but they are doing the same thing). I infact
reject them here and everything continue to work properly...
Anyway the other part of the patch is still good and I would like to see
it included :).
