Yup, thanks a lot!

This is a bug in several ALSA drivers.
@Fabio:
As a workaround, compile "Sequencer support" statically (non-modular).
@Jaroslav:
Several drivers have a wrong logic for CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER. The correct 
solution is something like the following:
--- sound/pci/emu10k1/emu10k1.c.old	2003-06-21 03:02:04.000000000 +0200
+++ sound/pci/emu10k1/emu10k1.c	2003-06-21 03:02:31.000000000 +0200
@@ -35,7 +35,7 @@
 MODULE_DEVICES("{{Creative Labs,SB Live!/PCI512/E-mu APS},"
 	       "{Creative Labs,SB Audigy}}");
 
-#if defined(CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER) || defined(CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER_MODULE)
+#if defined(CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER) || (defined (MODULE) && defined(CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER_MODULE))
 #define ENABLE_SYNTH
 #include <sound/emu10k1_synth.h>
 #endif
If you comfirm this is correct I'll send a fix for all affected drivers.
