No.  What was advertised was a SCSI BOF which you then took over and
spent the entire time talking about the Adaptec SAS driver.  You weren't
interested in discussing wider SCSI issues.  You weren't interested in
talking about how other vendors implemented SAS.  You weren't interested
in discussing how we could get the best possible SAS interface in Linux.
You shut down other people when they tried to discuss these things.
It was a complete waste of time.
