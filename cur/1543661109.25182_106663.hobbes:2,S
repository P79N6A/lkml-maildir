Yea, I'm assuming it would be rare enough that the div won't be too much
of a performance drop and would make the code more clear. Although if it
is a concern I'm not opposed to speeding it up.

Yea, I'm not psyched about that as well (not only is it updated twice,
but three times: arch independent, tsc and cyclone). The inline bit
sounds interesting, are you planning on pushing that in?
