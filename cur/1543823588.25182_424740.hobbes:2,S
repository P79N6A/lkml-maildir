Hmm, like what?

I thought about using boot_ioremap, but it seems to be an abuse.  Since
I'm not mapping io, but actual memory pages.  So the solution to that
seemed more of a hack.  I then would need to worry about grabbing pages
that were node specific and getting the physical addresses.  It just
looked like a cleaner solution to have an API that was for exactly what it
was meant for.
