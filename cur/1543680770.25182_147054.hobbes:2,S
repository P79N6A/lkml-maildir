Your first message said, "I see no reason for pure paranoia, 
particularly if it's not commented as such."  A BUG_ON() call makes it 
clear that the condition should never happen.  Dereferencing a NULL 
leaves the question of whether NULL is an unhandled case or invalid 
input.  BUG_ON() is an explicit paranoia check, and with a bit of 
preprocessing magic, you could compile out all of those checks.
So it documents invalid input conditions, allows you to eliminate the 
checks in the name of speed or your personal preference, or use them to 
help with debugging/testing.
