It's been doing this ever since the input layer changes:
- open a few xterms
- press the spacebar, leave pressed
- start waggling the mouse about
- stop pressing spacebar, keep waggling the mouse about,
  across the xterms
The keystrokes *never* stop coming.  Just the continuous mouse
activity causes a stream of keyboard input, at seemingly the normal
autorepeat rate. I can keep them coming for 30 seconds, just by
moving the mouse.
In practice, it's irritating because it's quite easy to get a
stream of erroneous input dumped into the wrong windows.
It's a vanilla dual pentium with an AT keyboard and a PS/2
mouse.
