Actually the code is a little destructive, and it stomps all the sections
(symbol table, comments, debug, etc) and everything else which isn't essential
to making an executable object.  I've only been working with executables so
far, so I haven't looked into the details of how it would work with shared
libraries.
It isn't possible to get away with simply rearranging the PHDRs, because of
course you have to physically reorder all the data they point to, since that's
the point of the exercise.
