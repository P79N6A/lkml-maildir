I was wondering if there was any thought to providing a mechanism for  
SPI bus drivers to implement a direct synchronous interface so we  
don't have to use wait_for_completion.
The case I have is I need to talk to a microcontroller connected over  
SPI.  I'd like to be able to issue a command to the microcontroller  
in a MachineCheck handler before the system reboots.  I need a truly  
synchronous interface opposed to one fronting the async interface.
Also, who is the maintainer for the SPI subsystem?
thanks
