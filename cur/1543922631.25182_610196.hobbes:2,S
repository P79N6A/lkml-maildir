Well there are things we can do, yes, but I'd be worried that they've
give up the deterministic behavior we rely on quite heavily for
debugging. If event A happens before event B, we must see the message
from A before the one from B, even if B happens in irq context. 
And if event B is a hard lock up, we'd also like to be sure the
message for A actually gets out. If B happens in the interrupt that
comes in when we re-enable them, that won't happen.
(This is also a problem on unaccelerated video consoles, where
scrolling may actually be slower than 115kbps!)
