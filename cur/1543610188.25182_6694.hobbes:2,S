Subject: 2.4.15-pre1:  "bogus" message with reiserfs root and other weirdness

I just tried changing my root and /usr partitions from ext2 to reiserfs and noticed some weird messages on boot.
Partitions on my ide-drive are like this:
   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1   *         1       521   4184901    c  Win95 FAT32 (LBA)
/dev/hda2           524       654   1052257+  83  Linux
/dev/hda3           655       785   1052257+  82  Linux swap
/dev/hda4           786      5606  38724682+   5  Extended
/dev/hda5           786      1308   4200966   83  Linux
/dev/hda6          1309      5606  34523653+  83  Linux
Where hda2 is root and hda5 is /usr. The windows partition was empty at the time and i use lilo on the MBR. Lilo is version 22.1, kernel version 2.4.15-pre1. Anyway, i took backups of the root and /usr partitions with cp -a to another partition, booted from a bootdisk with reiserfs support, ran mkreiserfs and copied stuff back with cp -a. Checked that everything went back alright, ran lilo and booted.
Machine booted ok and everything seemed to be ok, but i noticed a few weird messages in boot messages right before mounting the root-partition:
FAT: bogus logical sector size 0
FAT: bogus logical sector size 0
Other reiserfs mounts didn't give this message. it doesn't seem serious but a little disturbing still.
Also, I noticed some weird interactions with the bttv-driver. I have a bt878 based tv-card.
The bttv module and all other modules it requires loaded without hickups, didn't see anything unusual in their log-messages, but as soon as i tried starting any program that uses the video-device, I got this message:
kernel: bttv: vmalloc_32(4259840) failed
As soon as i changed my root and /usr partitions back to ext2 the same way I changed to reiserfs before, these problems disappeared. Nothing else on my computer changed in between these filesystem changes. Any ideas on what might cause this?
