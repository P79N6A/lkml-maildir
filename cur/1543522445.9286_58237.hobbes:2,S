Subject: SysV IPC msg queue limits

I'm trying to increase the limits for SysV message queues (specifically,
MSGMNB, MSGMNI, and MSGQNUM).  I can increase the first two with no problem.
When I try to increase MSGMNB, it fails.  I can't even write a single
message without getting EAGAIN.  I assume this is because of the msqid_ds
structure: (excerpt below)
/* one msqid structure for each queue on the system */
struct msqid_ds {
...
        unsigned short msg_cbytes;      /* current number of bytes on queue */
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        unsigned short msg_qnum;        /* number of messages in queue */
        unsigned short msg_qbytes;      /* max number of bytes on queue */
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
...
};
Has anyone else attempted to increase MSGMNB to, say, 256k?  I assume this will
break most existing software, since they all rely on a short msg_qbytes and
msg_cbytes for msgctl calls, but this is an application that won't share with
anything else, and I can recompile any apps that need IPC.
I've tried just changing those to unsigned int, but for whatever reason I lost
the ability to send any messages (always returned EAGAIN when IPC_NOWAIT was
set, or just blocked otherwise).
