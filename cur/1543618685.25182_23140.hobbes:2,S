If I'm not mistaken (and I probably am), the F00F bug causes the proc to 
screw  up the handling of an invalid instruction.  I.E. no legitimate 
program would possibly cause this, only hand-written bytecode (or, 
theoretically, a stack overflow overwriting a return address to point to 
data) can cause this.
So unless someone's trying to mess with you, I doubt F00F is affecting you.
