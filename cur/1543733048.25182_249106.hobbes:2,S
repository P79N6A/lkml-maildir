Trivial example union mount:
Top layer:	<empty>
2nd layer:	foo
Writes to foo have to be done in the top layer, so foo has to be
copied up first.  And since that has to be done inside the kernel,
any possible implementation will be similar to my code.
For further details on unionmount, you should ask Jan directly.  But
for politeness' sake, please wait a month or two, so he can focus on
his university exams before getting into the flamewars. ;)
