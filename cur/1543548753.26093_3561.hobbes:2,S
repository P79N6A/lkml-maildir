Indeed. But in the mean time, a scsi driver for Onstream drives has
been written (by me). Together with Kai Makisara I have resolved how 
to get those drives detected by this new driver (osst) and not by st.
The second patch that Matt refers to inserts that logic into st so
it does not try to support these drives and fails due to the drive
particulars. Since SCSI, USB and IDE versions of these drives exist,
patching st is more appropriate than ide-scsi.
