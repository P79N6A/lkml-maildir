Outside clockevents I'd like to see at least the flag handling fixed 
before it gets merged.
Inside clockevents I could poke around forever...

A rather simple example would be profiling, where a separate timer is 
useful to see stuff that runs from the main timer, which is currently 
invisible.
It's insofar a clocksource thing as clock source and clock events should 
form a union, currently it's separate and that's a big problem. It's not 
really problem to have multiple clock sources and they don't really have 
to be synchronized with each other, but events _are_ connected to the 
source they are coming from.
In the end we could even expose multiple clocks via the posix clock/timer 
interface, but with the current design I don't see how this is possible.
bye, Roman
