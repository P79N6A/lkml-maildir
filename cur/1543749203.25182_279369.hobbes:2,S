The Xen interface seems to me better described that most of the kernel
interfaces and has more papers written on it. I would rather see
arch/xen and public exposure and use of the platform before considering
major redesigns. The s390 people have proved we can remove/fold arch
directories effectively and after original implementation without
problems.
I'm not convinced by your arguments about arch/xen although I am long
term in favour because I'd like see it easy to build a kernel which can
be used without Xen and can switch into Xen guest mode on Xen loading.
