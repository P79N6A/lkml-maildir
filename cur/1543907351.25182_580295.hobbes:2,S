Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.35 compilation failed in LVM

Hello,
I tried to get 2.4.35 to compile on a file server I manage, and got that:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.4/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing
-fno-common -fno-builtin-sprintf -fomit-frame-pointer
-Wno-pointer-sign -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686
-fno-unit-at-a-time -DMODULE -DMODVERSIONS -include
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include/linux/modversions.h  -nostdinc -iwithprefix
include -DKBUILD_BASENAME=lvm  -c -o lvm.o lvm.c
lvm.c:397: error: static declaration of 'vg_count' follows non-static
declaration
lvm-internal.h:48: error: previous declaration of 'vg_count' was here
looking in the 2.4.35 patch, this has been modified, is there already
a fix for that ?
Reverting the attached patch hunk fixed the compilation for me...
