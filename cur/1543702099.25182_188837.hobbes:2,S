I'd love to agree with that...

This works provided you can take the address of the lvalue, which
ain't true for bitfields.  Example:
 #define bit_field(var, bit, width) \
	(((struct { long : bit; long _f : width; } *) &(var))->_f)
 long l;
 bit_field(l, 0, 4) = 13;
 bit_field(l, 8, 12) = 42;
I wish I was making this up, but I know of at least one legacy app
where disabling GCC's ability to treat statement-expressions as
l-values will cause a major headache.
I'd love to know a way of doing this in ANSI C99 without requiring
changes to to uses of this kind of (atrocious) macro...
