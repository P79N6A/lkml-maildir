The example code from
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0202.0/att-0603/01-cd_poll.c
Does not behave as expected on my 2.6.0-test5 system.  While the command 
seems to be successfully sent - 2 of my drives report it as an invalid 
opcode - for the other 2 drives, the buffer comes back all zeros.
(actually, the buffer's contents will remain in whatever state they're in 
before the ioctl is called)
Sending the same command to those 2 drives with SG_IO results in the 
expected behaviour.
