Wow! I thought I really knew what I was talking about, but you've really
convinced me to see things you're way!
I would prefer that this discussion contain factual information and educated
opinions, and if those facts turn out to be wrong or opinions based on
erroneous information, I would like to see them corrected with sources and
citations.
But if you're just going to call names, you're just wasting space on the
archive server.
