Should be -pre5, sorry.

With the bdflush-parameters above, I get
nr bench read       write      2.4.19-pre5  expected factor
9  dd    30GB HDD   DVD-RAM    208/0/6      60       3.5
10 dd    120GB HDD  DVD-RAM    39/0/6       32       1.2
11 dd    30GB HDD   ZIP        66/0/10      60       1.1
12 dd    120GB HDD  ZIP        85/0/7       32       2.7
Numbers in the column 2.4.19-pre5 are total time / user time / system
time in seconds.
Performance is much better with the new parameters. Also, with the new
parameters, the system can read from HDD almost steadily while writing
to DVD. This should much increase responsiveness.
In cases 9 and 12 where performance is bad, both tested drives are on
the same IDE controller. Should that matter?
> Right fix is different but not suitable for 2.4.
I'm looking forward to the definitive solution.
Thank you very much,
Moritz
