Subject: vmalloc/module_alloc: unable to handle two memory regions

On ARM, modules need to either be placed within 32MB of the kernel
image, or we need to build a jump table for code jumps within the
module to reach the main kernel body.
In order to solve this problem, we created a 16MB region between
TASK_SIZE and PAGE_OFFSET for modules.  Any allocations within this
range are required to be linked into the "vmlist" for /proc/kcore -
this list also used by vmalloc() and friends.
On ARM, we end up with the following virtual memory layout:
 +----------------------------+ 4GB
   devices
 +----------------------------+
   vmalloc/ioremap
 +----------------------------+ PAGE_OFFSET + RAM_SIZE
   kernel direct-mapped ram
 +----------------------------+ PAGE_OFFSET (3GB) = MODULE_END = 0xc0000000
   module
 +----------------------------+ TASK_SIZE = MODULE_START = 0xbf000000
   user space
 +----------------------------+
This idea was borrowed from x86_64, and appears on the face of it to
be the perfect solution.  However, it can (and does) go horribly wrong.
After loading many modules, I end up with the following vm_struct vmlist:

Pay special attention to the last entry - it starts at 0xbf094000, and
ends at 0xc0095000 - it overlaps the kernel direct mapped RAM.  What's
more is that the entries at 0xbf013000, 0xbf015000, 0xbf040000 and
0xbf094000 are for ioremapped memory, but are placed in the module
region.
This occurs due to the way get_vm_area() works:
	addr = VMALLOC_START;
...
        for (p = &vmlist; (tmp = *p) ;p = &tmp->next) {
                if ((size + addr) < addr)
                        goto out;
                if (size + addr <= (unsigned long)tmp->addr)	/* A */
                        goto found;
                addr = tmp->size + (unsigned long)tmp->addr;
                if (addr > VMALLOC_END - size)
                        goto out;
        }
Initially, addr is > PAGE_OFFSET.  If the first vmlist entry is 0xbf000000,
size 0x00013000, "A" is obviously false, and we calculate the new addr.
This ends up being 0xbf013000, which is _less than_ VMALLOC_START.  Let's
say, for the case of argument, that the size being requested is 0x02000000,
and VMALLOC_END is 0xe0000000.
addr + size = 0xc1013000, which overlaps the kernel direct mapped region.
It is still below VMALLOC_START, and it's less than VMALLOC_END.  We end
up allocating this region, and overwriting the kernel direct-mapped
page tables, in this case completely unmapping the kernel from virtual
memory space.
Oops.
The following should fix this, and needs to be applied to _all_ allocators
which touch the vmlist (I'd rather remove the duplication and have one
common allocation function, but that's a subject for separate discussion):
