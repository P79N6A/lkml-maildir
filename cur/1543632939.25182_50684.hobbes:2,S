Looks fine to me, though I didn't test it either ;-)
However, it's possible to put the struct completion onto the stack
as I suggested, it saves a couple of bytes in struct driver, and, more
importantly, it'll blow up if the refcount goes to zero before 
driver_unregister() has been called, so it provides a bug trap for
messed-up refcounting.
Anyway, that's a question of taste, I suppose.
