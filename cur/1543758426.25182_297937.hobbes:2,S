I would bet the benefit you are seeing has to do with batching rather
than such an optimization flag. Different ballgame.
I relooked at their code snippet, they dont even have skbs built nor
even figured out what sock or PID. That work still needs to be done it
seems in cn_netlink_send(). So probably all they need to do is move the
check in cn_netlink_send() instead. This is assuming they are not
scratching their heads with some realted complexities.
I am gonna disapear for a while; hopefully the original posters have
gathered some ideas from what we discussed.
cheers,
