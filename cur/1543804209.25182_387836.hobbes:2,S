_Some_ notifiers better be light.  Others can be heavier.  And it sure 
would be a good thing to indicate in the code which are which.  That's a 
lot better than trying to read and understand the entire kernel in order 
to gather impressions about how a certain class of routines is used.
In the patch we classified chains as blocking or atomic based on how they
were used, not on how often they get called.  The patch includes a
provision specifically for lightweight notifiers: the raw notifier type.  
If you want to identify which chains should be switched over to the raw
type, then fine.  But _you_ will have to provide protection for them.

What happens if the last serial number run is no longer on the chain?  
You would never find it, and so would never know where to pick up from.  
And what happens if the chain is changed while you are checking (or just
after you have checked) the serial number?  There's still a race.
You see?  Doing this correctly is not so easy after all...
If you think about it a little more carefully, you'll see why.  To be
safe, unregistration has to guarantee when it returns that the entry being
removed is not in use and will not be called in the future.  If other CPUs
are traversing the chain in a lightweight fashion, the only way you can
fulfill this guarantee is to wait until all the current traversers have 
finished, a la RCU.  And if the traversers can sleep, the simplest way to 
wait for them is to use an rwsem.

In going through the kernel, looking for places where notifier chains were
locked locally, there were surprisingly few instances (no more than one, I
think) where that lock was used for other things too.
There are a lot of notifier chains that _can_ use locks.  That's what the 
patch is for, to provide the locking for them, all in one place, so they 
don't have to do it themselves in many different places.
For other notifier chains that don't want locking (or don't want the kind
of locking provided by the new API), there's always the raw notifier type.
