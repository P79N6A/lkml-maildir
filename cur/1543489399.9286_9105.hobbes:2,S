   That's actually a good reason to stuff it into the baseline kernel.
   If it's in the baseline kernel and nobody cares about it, the kernel
   will change out from under it and it will die (cf: xiafs, extfs,
   probably a stack of formerly supported device drivers) because the
   people supporting it will eventually lose interest and move on to
   something else.

   david parsons \bi/ It's better than a long argument about what ought
                  \/                       to be in the kernel, anyways.
