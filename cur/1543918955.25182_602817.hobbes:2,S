Why exactly do you need to change UID to a predefined set?
Do your app need to work with files owned by those users perhaps?
If so, consider filesystem solutions:
 * make a group with all these users in, make the files rw for this group
or
 * Use ACLs and let whatever UID your process use, have access to
    the files in question.
Another approach if filesystem tricks don't fit your need:
Have a small process running as root. It should not do much
io or data processing, so its source is small and easy to audit. You
can make reasonably sure it has no security holes. This minimal app
will when needed:
 * fork,
 * set the correct UID for this particular job,
 * exec the app that do  work that is so complicated that
   security holes might happen.
