Hi all
After reading "Wonderful World of Linux 2.4" (Penguin Wizard) at
http://www.linuxdevices.com/files/misc/WWOL2.4.html,
 I found
somthing about union mounting file systems under "Linux internals",
(seventh paragraph).
I've been trying to find out how to do this, but I just fail. Some places
I get the expression that I just have to mount the first file system, and
afterwards, just use the option "-o union" to mount, but still, the
originally mounted file system will disappear as soon as I mount another
on top of it.
Q: Is it possible to union mount file systems in linux 2.4 (currently
   using 2.4.5)?
Q: Should I just go home and start doing my homework?
Best regards
roy
