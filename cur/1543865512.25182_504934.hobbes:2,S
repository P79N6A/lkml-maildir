Hi,
I tried to use the new pata drivers on a Dual PII-400Mhz with the
Intel PIIX controller.
Unfortunately the controller doesn't get detected on boot time, the
old IDE drivers do work and see the controller as a PIIX4 chipset,
which is correct.
The mainboard is a Asus P2B with integrated Adaptec SCSI host and the
PIIX controller.
