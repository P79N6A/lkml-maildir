My apologies for the delay.  Paid work gets in the way sometimes...
I haven't had a chance to test the patch yet, but have confirmed that it is 
definately a drive-related problem.  I put it on my ICH4 as slave to another 
drive that passes the validation bit, then put the Quantum back on the ICH5 
and put the other drive in as slave.  The other drive always passes the 
validation bit and the Quantum always fails.
Another suggestion would be to make a kernel parameter such as ide0=ivb or 
hda=ivb to force ignoring the validation bit...  That way, we don't need a 
list of drive models hardcoded into the kernel.
I'll test the patch ASAP.
