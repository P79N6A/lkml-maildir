Subject: 2.2 generating odd TCP resets?

I've been trying to get xsane-win32 working with a linux server.
It keeps failing because read() on the win95 box returns an error
just before the data transfer is complete.
Dumping the conversation, I see linux sending a TCP RST:
00:26:29.260171 > porky.cisco.com.1034 > scan.1029: P 2185689:2187149(1460) ack 2 win 32120 (DF)
00:26:29.260988 < scan.1029 > porky.cisco.com.1034: . 2:2(0) ack 2187149 win 0 (DF)
00:26:29.288496 < scan.1029 > porky.cisco.com.1034: . 2:2(0) ack 2187149 win 1460 (DF)
00:26:29.288551 > porky.cisco.com.1034 > scan.1029: FP 2187149:2187555(406) ack 2 win 32120 (DF)
00:26:29.288861 < scan.1029 > porky.cisco.com.1034: . 2:2(0) ack 2187556 win 1054 (DF)
00:26:29.320316 < scan.1029 > porky.cisco.com.1034: . 2:2(0) ack 2187556 win 8354 (DF)
00:26:29.320404 > porky.cisco.com.1034 > scan.1029: R 3147707184:3147707184(0) win 0
Why is it sending a reset? Because the FIN was ACK'ed twice? Is this correct
behavior? I've tried 2.2.14 and 2.2.17, with the same result.
b.c.
