Yeah, it was definitely needed as otherwise we could soft hang devices
in some conditions.
The md/ directory is also still currently largely broken (md as well as
dm), I'll take a gander at fixing that up as well.

Yep I think I'll change that too, so it's clear that we are dealing with
the io side of things.

The merging is good enough as is, I don't think you broke accounting
there. Currently we lack the queue to signal a plug against in the
private plugging, this is what needs some more massaging (if possible,
it may just make more sense to forget about it).

Me too, I'll try and get some testing done next week.
