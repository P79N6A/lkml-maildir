Not that I know of, flash games became popular the last weeks.
I can try some older kernels though.

I wish it was that simple.  But according to "top", the xservers runs
with NI=0.  I believe I got rid of the X renicing at the time the scheduler
was improved.  Nobody played flash games at the time though.
I have tried running two tuxracers too, and found this to be somewhat
bursty.  Instead of the players enjoying half a cpu each (which
is bearable at sufficiently low resolution), they seem to get bursts of cpu
and short pauses.  I never bothered looking more into this as  the
pci card always hangs the machine after a while when doing 3D. Instead
I disabled DRI on that xserver.  Stability is more important.
