Well if they are relying on having a lot of stack available then those
places are buggy.  Once the softirq is made pending it can run at any
time that interrupts are enabled.  You can't rely on a softirq handler
having any more stack available than a hard interrupt handler has.

Ah, ok, I misunderstood, I thought you were saying that that softirq
framework itself had a lot of overhead.

As for the gigabit ethernet case, if we are having packets coming in
and generating hard interrupts at that sort of a rate then what we
really need is the sort of interrupt throttling that Jamal talked
about at the 2.5 kernel kickoff.
It seems to me that possibly softirqs are being used in some places
where a kernel thread would be more appropriate.  Instead of making
softirqs use a kernel thread, I think it would be better to find the
places that should use a thread and make them do so.  Softirqs are
still after all interrupt handlers (ones that run at a lower priority
than any hardware interrupt) and should be treated as such.
