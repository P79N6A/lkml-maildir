The capture features are undocumented and unsupported (to my knowledge).
As far as I have heard, the Rainbow Runner card is not supported in Linux
and Matrox has no plans of doing it.
As for the dual monitor...
You need XFree86 4.0.1 or later.  Matrox has drivers for 4.0.1.  The last
time I checked, they did not have anything that compiles under 4.0.2.
Dual monitor mode works with xinerama as long as you are at the same
resolution and color depth.  (I have it working on my machine here.  The
Matrox driver docs tell how to make it work. It is not hard.)
I have noticed some visual problems on the second screen under 4.0.2.
(Ugly, but usable.)  Not certain when that will get fixed.  Due to Matrox
using a proprietary library (HALlib), there is not alot of effort being
put into making it work right.  (Kind of working in the dark at this
point...)
This is more of a question for the xpert list on xfree86.org.
