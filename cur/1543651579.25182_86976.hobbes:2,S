I agree that package managers should eventually be made aware of capabilities, 
like they are now aware of file modes/ownership. There are several other 
configuration issues to figure out that may depend on the overall purpose of 
a system, like which user(s) are granted which capabilities when logging in, 
checking the capabilities of installed binaries, etc.

Yes.
