Using RH Linux kernel 2.4.18, setting "features" bit NETIF_F_IP_CSUM does
not appear
to keep a valid IP checksum from being computed in packets presented to my
driver
for transmission. So having HW compute outgoing checksum buys nothing.
Checked this
by suppressing HW checksum computation. Packets are still accepted by peer.
