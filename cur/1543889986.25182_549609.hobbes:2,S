Well, I have the same hardware as dean, and do not see the 
BUG_ON/WARN_ON traces that he sees.  These are the same two code 
locations that caused spewage before.  This only difference I see is 
that he is testing with an NCQ-capable disk, and I am not -- which could 
be a very significant difference.  Dave also appears to have an 
NCQ-capable disk.
Dave's output (sent privately to me) was different -- errors and 
corruption -- rather than the BUG_ON/WARN_ON stuff both he and dean sent 
in March 2007, which is interesting.
Dave, any chance you could try 2.6.22-rc3 + my v4 patch, on a different 
hard drive?  Preferably a non-Maxtor, or at least not another Maxtor 
6L200S0.  If that's a big deal, don't worry about it.  I just want to 
rule out buggy firmware and/or bad hard drive in your case.
dean's output (backtraces matching March 2007 reports) was what I 
expected, and if I can reproduce that with an NCQ-capable disk locally, 
I should be able to fix it from there without trouble.  Probably just 
some hardware bits accidentally kicking into NCQ mode, when they should not.
