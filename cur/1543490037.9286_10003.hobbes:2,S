On Alpha, a scatter-gather solution is the *only* way to allow all devices
direct access to all of memory. Without it, one is forced to employ bounce
buffers.

Bounce buffers are buffers in memory at locations that can be accessed
directly by devices, in a system which has additional memory which CANNOT be
directly accessed by those devices because of their addressing limitations.
This has been most commonly encountered with "true" ISA devices, which have
a memory address limitation of 16Mb (24 bits). In a machine which has more
than 16Mb of memory, a device driver could allocate a buffer in the low 16Mb
of the address space, do the device DMA to that buffer, and then copy the
data out of that buffer to a memory location above 16Mb, hence the name
"bounce buffer".
And one would not use SG mapping to implement bounce buffers; SG mapping
eliminates the need for bounce buffers.

It is NOT part of the PCI spec; it is a platform specific feature, implemented
(differently) on the ALPHA and SPARC, and probably others.

No idea, but this would prolly be covered by an NDA at this time, anyway... ;-}

If correctly designed.

Well, let examine it...
Case 1: bus_alloc where direct access is possible without SG mapping, is
        simply the equivalent of virt_to_bus now. bus_dealloc is a no-op.
Case 2: bus_alloc where SG mapping must be used to directly access memory,
        returns the bus address (in the SG map) for the desired destination.
        bus_dealloc will release the SG mapping resources used.
Case 3: bus_alloc where bounce buffers are required, simply returns the
        bus address of an allocated bounce buffer. bus_dealloc would copy
        the bounce buffer to the desired destination, and free the bounce
        buffer.
A bit overly simplistic, but did I miss/overlook anything? Does this seem
reasonable?
