    I think so...

    I don't know their reasons because I haven't read any rationale
(if any exists at all). Anyway, I've used LLH (including the scsi
part) for building my new glibc and 'make check' passes. In fact, I'm
answering this email from the system I've upgraded, so glibc seems to
work ok ;)

    That's what I thought. Apps must, first, use glibc headers, not
kernel ones, and that cannot be broken by using llh, and in fact I
rely on llh because mistakes in the kernel headers will probably be
noticed very, very fast.

    Thank you :) BTW, you've done a great work with llh. I really
like it and that's the reason I chose llh and not raw kernel headers
in the first place. Keep on doing such a great job :)
