I don't have a PS/2 wheel mouse on my system, but kudzu finds one when I 
boot 2.5.69-bk*. I have a USB Wheel mouse attached though. I'm wondering 
if this may be the cause of the issue with some USB mice and trackballs 
not working when ACPI is loaded without pci=noacpi.
Comments would be appreciated.
Thanks,
David
