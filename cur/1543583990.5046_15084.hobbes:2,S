This is a problem that UML is going to have when I turn SMP back on.  
Emulating a multiprocessor box on a UP host with the existing locking 
primitives is going to result in exactly this problem.

That sounds like a pretty fundamental (and abusable) mechanism.
I had a suggestion from an IBM guy at ALS last year to make UML "spin"-locks 
actually sleep in the host (this doesn't make them sleep locks in userspace 
because they don't call schedule), which sounds reasonable.  This gives the 
lock-holder an opportunity to run immediately.  It's unclear to me what the 
wake-up mechanism would be, though.
Another thought I had was to raise the priority of a thread holding a 
spinlock.  This would reduce the chance that it would be preempted by a thread 
that will waste a timeslice spinning on that lock.  I don't know whether this 
is a good idea either.
