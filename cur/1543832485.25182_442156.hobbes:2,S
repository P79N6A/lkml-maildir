Hello
I'm trying to get Linux running on a Nokia IP130 box.
The 3x Intel i82551ER NICs doesn't work.
This is the console messages (I've added printing of the checksum values):

With vanilla 2.6.17, the e100 module dies with EAGAIN.
Apply this patch which just removes the error return path (and adds a
little debug info):

        }
        return 0;

And everything works!
I think I've heard about this bug before, but I don't know why it occurs.
So the best I can do is the above (ignore failed EEPROM checksum test).
My hardware is:
00:0e.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 8255xER/82551IT Fast
Ethernet Controller (rev 10)
00:0f.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 8255xER/82551IT Fast
Ethernet Controller (rev 10)
00:10.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 8255xER/82551IT Fast
Ethernet Controller (rev 10)
I was wondering if we can just remove the -EAGAIN return from the
driver and in effect turn the EEPROM checksum stuff into a non-fatal
test?  Since I can't figure out the correct way to test the checksum
on this hardware, that seems like the best thing to do to me...
