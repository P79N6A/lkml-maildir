hdparm -I works just fine now.
hdparm -i requires the HDIO_GET_IDENTITY ioctl() from drivers/ide,
to retrieve the "boot time" copy of the identify block, before any
mods are made by the driver.  But in recent years, drivers/ide has
broken it, in that it tries to maintain the "boot time" copy in sync
with the on-drive copy.  Kinda makes -i pointless.
Is there a way to retrieve the libata cached copy of the ID block?
How?
>Support for IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE would be nice too.
It already does that, using HDIO_DRIVE_CMD to retrieve it
in the same way as for regular IDENTIFY DEVICE commands.
In hdparm-7.0, I'll have it use ATA passthrough when possible
for most/all commands.
Cheers
