Not quite true for migration threads; they're kicked off smp_init(),
called strictly after smp_prepare_cpus(), so all's well with them.
The idle threads shouldn't enter schedule() either, since
start_secondary() spins until smp_init() sets the smp_commenced_mask
bits in cpu_up().
So the important parts of all that were unfortunately all wrong. I'll
look again.
