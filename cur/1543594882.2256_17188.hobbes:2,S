Hi,
I do not know whether I should ask this question on this mailing list, but
it definitely has to do either with the kernel confiuration or kernel
support.
In the '/dev' tree, the device file entries for SCSI harddisks ranges from
'/dev/sda' to '/dev/sdp'. If I attach 17 scsi harddisks to a system, the
17th harddisk is shown  as '/dev/sdq' in '/proc/partitions' but there is no
entry in the '/dev' tree. If I try to access '/dev/sdq' either through
fdisk or through   any other simple C programs, it gives error saying, can
not open device '/dev/sdq'.
How can I access more than 16 harddisks?
Regards,
Daljeet.
