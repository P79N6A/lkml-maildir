Superblocks (one copy for each 8MB block group), group descriptors (copy
per each block group, 32 bytes per group), block and inode use bitmaps (2
blocks per group), and inode tables (also local to groups, 128 bytes per
inode). Then there's the 5% reserved space (both blocks and inodes, IIRC).
The reserved space means that root can still write logs, mail, etc., after
users have filled up your drive, and it means there are usually strings of
contiguous blocks around to avoid fragmentation.
