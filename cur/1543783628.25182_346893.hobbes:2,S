Noone's ignoring you. 
What we need to do is ensure that dynamic ticks is working properly on x86 and 
worth including before anything else. If and when we confirm this it makes 
sense only then to try and merge code from the other 2 architectures to as 
much common code as possible as no doubt we'll be modifying other 
architectures we're less familiar with. At that stage we will definitely want 
to tread even more cautiously at that stage.
