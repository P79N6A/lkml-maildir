Thats why one can use mmap(). This basically lets the OS decide,
_when_ to map a page into physical RAM and when to flush it. So
we can reorder, as we like. What we miss is a list of pages that
should be read or written but do not need to now. This would be
nice for servers/workstations, but would harm laptop batteries.
You only suggest it for writes (in the part snipped ;-)), but I
would like to see it for (streaming) reads, too.
