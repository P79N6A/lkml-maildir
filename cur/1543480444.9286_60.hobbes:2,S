I fixed top, ps, and more.

You can set HZ to 1024 without recompiling. You don't have to
make /proc report values as if HZ had not been changed,
but you could. It is your option.
That also includes:
CPU time info is correct for the very first time.
Unix98 pty devices are shown.
Both "ps aux" and "ps -ef" work now, and you can mix them freely.
You don't have to update /etc/psdatabase when you recompile Linux.
You don't have to update /etc/psdevtab when you change /dev.
Processes can be selected by name. ("ps -C xterm,nxterm,rxvt")
Formats are totally user-defined. ("ps -o ruser,euser,pid,cmd")
Isn't it time you upgraded?
