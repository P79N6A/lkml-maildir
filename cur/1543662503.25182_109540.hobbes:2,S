Fed up with all these people trying to tell you when to release new
kernels?  Now you can just use this simple script to do it
automatically!
#!/bin/sh
echo "Release a new kernel now!!!" > /tmp/kernel_reminder
echo "30 6 * * * /usr/bin/cat /tmp/kernel_reminder | mail root" >> /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root
