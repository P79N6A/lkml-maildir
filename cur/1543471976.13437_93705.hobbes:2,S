Did something change recently that prevents increasing NR_TASKS (to
4096)?  (I am remembering to do a make clean before recompiling.)
I did this happily with 35presomethings, but get reboots during
"Loading Linux Kernel" with .36 and .37pre{2,3}.  (Whether LILO or
zImage-on-a-floppy.)
ASUS P2L97 w/built-in Adaptec SCSI.  Bare-bones kernel: No ide.  No
serial.  No modules.  No cdrom.  192mb ecc sdram.  GCC 2.7.2.1.
zImage ~370kb.
