I don't feel that it is that far away ... IBM has already released a 64 CPU
intel based system (NUMA). We already have systems in that class (though
64 bit based) that use 5 TB file systems. The need is coming, and appears
to be coming fast. It should be resolved during the improvements to the
VFS.
A second reason to include it in the VFS is that the low level filesystem
implementation would NOT be required to use it. If the administrator
CHOOSES to access a 16TB filesystem from a workstation, then it should
be possible (likely something like the GFS, where the administrator is
just monitoring things, would be reasonable for a 32 bit system to do).
As I see it, the VFS itself doesn't really care what the block size is,
it just carries relatively opaque values that the filesystem implementation
uses. Most of the overhead should just be copying an extra 4 bytes around.
