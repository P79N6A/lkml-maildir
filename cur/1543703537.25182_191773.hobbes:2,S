I previously brought this up before but it was smothered in the
2.6.1-mm2 thread (or something like that. Even I forget.)
I'm using a USB mouse connected to my computer and X is only reading
from /dev/input/mice. However, I will receive spurious double-click
events out of completely nowhere. My mouse does not appear to move way
too fast (I have experienced it on my laptop) or anything obvious like
that. I am not using anything other than hid, input, and ohci-hcd for
the mouse.
Any ideas?
