Hmm.  I like it all except for disallow_signal.
disallow_signal currently only has one user, jffs2.  While jffs2
currently doesn't care, given the way jffs2 is using disallow_signal I
would expect it would prefer to have the signal blocked.
Thinking about this some more if jffs2 or anyone else wants blocked
signal behavior they can go ahead and block the signal.  Keeping
disallow_signal in sync with allow_signal seems to make sense.
Nothing in the kernel should break with this change so:
