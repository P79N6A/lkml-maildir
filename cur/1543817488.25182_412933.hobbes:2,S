I avoided doing this initially on the premise that I shouldn't do things 
'just because we might need it in the future' since that way seems to 
lead to madness.  Is there actual hardware that needs an argument to 
mmiowb() (i.e. that can't just do a read from the system's single bridge 
or something)?
