Hello Jeff,
I tested vanilla test7 with  ptrace() patch.
It breaks uml exactly like I see with any kernel > test7.
Seems like the ORIG_EAX != -1 is needed  to correctly restart syscall
after PTRACE_SYSCALL, but I did not check this codepath thoroughly.
Following what is going with uml, just for the very first exec:
[lots of trap_user.c:228, trap_user.c:149 skipped]
start_syscall():
process.c:181 ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGS, 4901, 0, 501242c0) = 0
finish_exec():
exec_user.c:26 ptrace(PTRACE_POKEUSER, 4901, UESP, bf7fff20) = 0
exec_user.c:27 ptrace(PTRACE_POKEUSER, 4901, EIP, 400019a0) = 0
exec_user.c:28 ptrace(PTRACE_POKEUSER, 4901, EDX, 0) = 0
exec_user.c:29 ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL, 4901, 0, 0) = 0
And voila, we got SIGSEGV instead of happy running child:
Child 4901 exited with signal 11
