Priority inversion.  I did a patch which does exactly
what you describe, around the 2.1 timeframe. It worked
fine most of the time, but occasionally the following
happened:
1) a SCHED_IDLE process got hold of some kernel lock
2) a normal, low-priority process started eating CPU
   for a number of seconds
3) a high-priority normal process wanted the lock the
   SCHED_IDLE task had, but had to wait several seconds,
   at times up to a minute, before the SCHED_IDLE task
   got a chance to run and release the lock
This wasn't too much of a problem on my own system, but
of course this is an easily exploitable vulnerability for
attackers.
For me, this just means we should improve the scheduler so
nice levels are stronger ... say that a nice +20 process
only gets 1% of the CPU of a normal priority process ;)
regards,
Rik
