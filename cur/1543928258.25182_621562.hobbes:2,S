...unless you're lucky enough to be on s390 where pio is not available.
I don't see why we'd have two different ways to talk to a virtio 
device. I think we should use a hypercall for interrupt injection, 
without support for grumpy old soldered pci features other than 
HPA-style Lguest PCI bus organization. There are no devices that we 
want to be backward compatible with.
