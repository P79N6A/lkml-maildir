There seem to be a separate set of functions for applying smp lock
prefixes and more "general" alternatives. I guess the "general"
alternatives and paravirt could be declared __init, and text_poke users
would have to use it responsibly. Such as:
__init apply_alternatives
__init apply_paravirt
non init:
alternatives_smp_*
alternatives_smp_
