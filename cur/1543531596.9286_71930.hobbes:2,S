Two strangeness noticed about 2.3.99pre3, otherwise all seems OK.
First strangeness:
The Makefiles don't seem to obey INSTALL_PATH anymore - it blithely
ignores and installs the kernel and its map files to the root despite
INSTALL_PATH being set to /boot!
Second strangeness:
I'm getting a lot of NMI interrupts - didn't happen with 2.2.x kernels.

Doesn't seem to be fatal though, but I remember getting this with the
early 2.1.x kernels before being fixed for 2.2.x.
