OK, fixed.  I've also created a slightly new structure in:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/tytso/e2fsprogs-interim
Each new version will be its own directory, i.e., e2fsprogs-1.39-tyt1,
with a symlink LATEST pointing at the most recent directory.
Within each directory, there will be a tarball of the complete
sources, as requested by akpm, as well a broken-out tar.gz file and a
single file that has all of the patches rolled up.  I've regenerated
the rollup patches this time with feeling (and the -N diff option :-),
so once the new structure gets mirrored out from master.kernel.org to
ftp.kernel.org, you should be able to get the fixed rollup patch, as
well as a pre-patched tarball.
