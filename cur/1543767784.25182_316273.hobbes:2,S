hello,
I am always trying to make sure I've booted the right kernel after a new install.
Too paranoid maybe. But I guess there're other people like me. So let's make kbuild
display the compile version number at the end to give us a hint. I know we may be
booting vmlinux someday, but don't care about it for now.
