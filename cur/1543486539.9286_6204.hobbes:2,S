"By the time"? Hmm.. here at BNL, we have been doing it for quite some time.
Our friends at Fermi have been doing it also. Our RHIC project is going
'live' in November, but we have been running our Linux Compute Farm for
almost a year, moving 2GB files around and processing them. Each machine
on our farm is at least a dual processor, so each machine will have 2
2GB files going at 1 time. Larger files would help us tremendously.

               The complete lack of evidence is the surest 
                  sign that the conspiracy is working.
