There's nothing which leaps out and says "wrong" in this.  But there's
nothing which leaps out and says "right", either.  It seems somewhat
arbitrary, that's all.
We have one filesystem which wants such a refactoring (although I don't
think you've adequately spelled out _why_ reiser4 wants this).
To be able to say "yes, we want this" I think we'd need to understand which
other filesystems would benefit from exploiting it, and with what results?
