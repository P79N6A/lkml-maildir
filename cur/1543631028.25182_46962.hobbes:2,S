There is no way to limit virtual memory to 44 bits.  I don't know how
your device works, but just fyi: ia64 divides the address space into 8
equal-sized regions and user space applications tend to use at least
two regions (2 for text and 3 for data/stack).  This means that even
with the smallest page size, you'll have to take virtual address bits
61-63 into account.
Hope this helps,
