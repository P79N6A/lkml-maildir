I know you haven't been just tweaking numbers ;) But in the case of the
patch that provides different behaviour depending on whether a sleep is
interruptible or not really smelt of papering over symptoms. Now it might
be that nothing better can be done without move invasive changes, but I
just thought I'd voice my concerns.
Oh, and remember that your desktop load is devoid of make -j big compiles,
so that is not a requisite for good interactivity.
