I agree.  One case we hit that did cause us a bug was local APIC 
delivery of self-IPIs.  I didn't dig too deep into why Linux was unhappy 
without immediate delivery (we deferred delivery here unnecessarily, but 
did not stop it).  I believe this was in SMP specific code that was 
using self-IPIs to regenerate IRQs .
