Sorry but you cannot roll back. alloc_kmemlist() could have been used for
tuning the cpucache while accesses to the slab continue. "Rolling back" 
would partially destroy the slab for some nodes and likely cause the 
system to crash. We can only roll back if this is actually an initial 
allocation and we are assured that the whole thing is not yet in use.
