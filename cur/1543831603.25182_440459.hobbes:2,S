The assumption that pdflush should to make pages un-dirty without
overload memory or IO is not for ext2 but for it sense. I'm working with
ext3. A lot of work it does while writepages(). pdflush is throttled:
while vmscan have sorted 32 page for paging-out it calls
blk_congestion_wait() nevertheless had it put one of 32 page into
congested queue or had not. pdflush is throttled.

I meant ->writepages() used by balance_dirty_pages(), see below.

This assumption is valid for ext2, where ->writepages() simply sends
pages to the storage, but other file systems (like reiser4) do a *lot*
of work in ->writepages() path, allocating quite an amount of memory
before starting write-out. With your patch, this work is done from
pdflush, and won't be throttled by may_write_to_queue() check, thus
increasing a risk of allocation failure.
