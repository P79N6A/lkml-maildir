Perhaps many less fortunate "users" ;) (_including_ myself), can change their 
minds anytime and open the lid again.
Thus, IMHO support for "changing ones mind" is imperative.
As to reboot, we hardly use it: 
- Test partitions get reset with the yournal doing the dirty work.
- The main partition gets rebooted only:
  - when some stupid app(s) leaked all memory away and we are out of swap
 ... sometimes weekly :-(
  - for (monthly) fsck.
  - when updating glibc twice a year or so
Dependable and flexible software suspend is a way of life yet to be 
experienced by many.
Offtopic, IMO a garbage collector is highly desirable...
