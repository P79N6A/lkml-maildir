A quick 'make -j bzImage' test I did yesterday got the system
to use near 70% of its CPU time in user mode and 30% in system
mode. This was with 2.4.17-rmap-10b, btw.
Though I have to admit the rmap patches should be considered
experimental, the last one does seem to survive some loads
where the standard kernel falls over ;)

Rik
