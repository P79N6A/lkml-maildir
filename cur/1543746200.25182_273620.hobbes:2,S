yes, it's needed in theory - see generic_file_buffered_write().  I'm trying
to remember why...
I think the only problem which that is solving is that the filesystem may
have left some blocks in the file outside i_size.  That's a minor
consistency issue which a fsck will fix up.  But I guess a subsequent lseek
may permit unwritten disk blocks to be read.
This problem is present whenever ->prepare_write() is called and we really
shouldn't be open-coding it everywhere.

Thanks. Does it pass all your testing?
