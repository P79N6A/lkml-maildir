I guessed that after I thought about it for a while and reworked the
algorithm for 0.7. To make things easier again, I added a new graph to the
reports which is in 0.7 called "Page Index Reference over Time"
see
http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/projects/vmregress/output_sample/mmap/read/25000/mapanon.html
It is the second graph. At the beginning, it is at the 0th page and it
moves through the address space over time. A totally random one would make
this graph look like noise. The graph should give a good idea how memory
was referenced.
In 0.6 and with these tests, it would have been a similar curve except the
last page would have been hit around 40000 references before the end of
the test. After that, the pages were referenced in a linear pattern which
was a mistake after reviewing it a bit.
If people are still interested, I'll run a full set of tests again on
2.4.19 and 2.4.19-rmap14a with 0.7 and post up the results complete with
the page reference information so you don't have to guess this time. It
takes about a full day to run a complete series. Any taker?

A reference in this test was reading a full page of information using
copy_from_user()
