Mercurial is:

 - easy to use: familiar commands, integrated help, integrated web server
 - space efficient: Linux kernel history back to 2.4.0 in 300MB
 - bandwidth efficient: 120MB to transfer that history
 - distributed: supports decentralized development with arbitrary merging
 - scalable: handles large numbers of files and revisions effortlessly
 - robust: append-only storage model with journalling and rollback
 - lightweight: small Python codebase
