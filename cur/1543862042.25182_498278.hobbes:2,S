Nope, I haven't looked in strace at all.  It's definitely making it to
user-space.  The code in question is (abbreviated):
   if (select(0, (fd_set *)0, (fd_set *)0, (fd_set *)0, &t) != 0) {
      PyErr_SetFromErrno(PyExc_IOError);
      return -1;
      }
which causes the Python interpreter to raise an IOError exception, including
the value of errno, which is 514.
Thanks,
Sean
