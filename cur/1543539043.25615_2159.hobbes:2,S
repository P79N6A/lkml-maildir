Hello everyone,
Effectively immediately, I would appreciate to have Device List
registrations sent to the address <device@lanana.org>.  This address
will be included in the next edited version of the Device List, and I
will still handle registrations sent to me personally for quite a
while, of course.  However, you can make my life a just a little bit
easier this way :)
Thanks for your cooperation.
