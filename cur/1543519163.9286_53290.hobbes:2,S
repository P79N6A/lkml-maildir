Ok, this worked for me, am downloading con2fb to test it.
But :
i configured matroxfb as normal driver and matroxfb_dh as module. but both the
matroxfb.o and all the fbcon-cfb stuff got copied in the module firectory, why
?
Also: 
matroxfb_dh refused to be loaded when X was running, I had to stop gdm, load
the module, and then start gdm again.
Friendly,
