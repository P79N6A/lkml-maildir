"FSL PowerPC bridge RapidIO" or something like that -- you
aren't doing a _generic_ rapidio binding here.

_All_ of these are "as specified in 1)".  You should be saying
the specifics for your device here; for example, what register
blocks of your controller are described in "reg", and in what
order?
