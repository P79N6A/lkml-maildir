A legal precedent valid in all jurisdictions?
Harald suceessfully takes legal actions against people violating his 
copyright on the Linux kernel under the terms of the GPL in Germany at 
German courts based on German laws.
If someone finds any legal precedent in Finland or the USA or Russia 
that some copyright would have lapsed for some reason, would this have 
any legal effect in Germany?
