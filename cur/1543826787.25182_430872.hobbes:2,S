The set_task_ioprio changes would make a nice concrete example.

On a related note.  When adding sysfs files, file perms (and for SELinux,
super block label) are the lowest common denominator for protections,
but should also be considered the last resort.  Smth 0644 may need e.g,
an explicit capable() check in ->store (in addition to the implicit
permission() check).
