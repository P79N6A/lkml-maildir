<jbarnes> bryce: would it be possible for you to include
  intel_reg_dumper in your intel driver pkg?
jesse - I looked into this, and in fact debian has already enabled this
in the 2.2.1 driver, which we are carrying in Hardy.  Timo had to
disable it though since we currently carry libpciaccess in universe, not
main.
However, I note that even after installing libpciaccess, it still fails
to compile (see below):

Yes, the same error occurs with the 2.2.1 driver we have in Hardy right now:
bryce@chideok:~/src/xserver-xorg-video-intel/xserver-xorg-video-intel-2.2.1-build/src/reg_dumper$ make
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../..     -Wall -Wpointer-arith -Wstrict-prototypes   -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations     -Wnested-externs -fno-strict-aliasing -I./.. -DREG_DUMPER -g -O2 -MT intel_reg_dumper-main.o -MD -MP -MF .deps/intel_reg_dumper-main.Tpo -c -o intel_reg_dumper-main.o `test -f 'main.c' || echo './'`main.c
main.c: In function 'main':
main.c:72: warning: implicit declaration of function 'pci_device_map_range'
main.c:72: warning: nested extern declaration of 'pci_device_map_range'
main.c:75: error: 'PCI_DEV_MAP_FLAG_WRITABLE' undeclared (first use in this function)
main.c:75: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
main.c:75: error: for each function it appears in.)
make: *** [intel_reg_dumper-main.o] Error 1
I could get it to build by ifdefing out th pci_device_map_range call,
and then adding -lpciaccess to the linker, however it segfaults without
that call.
Does LIBPCIACCESS require xserver 1.4?  (We have 1.3 in Hardy).
