As part of the TASK_KILLABLE changes, we're going to need
down_killable().  Unfortunately, semaphores are implemented for every
architecture, which we should probably fix at some point.
On the plane ride down here, I did the necessary changes for each
architecture:

I may have made mistakes.  Things to check:
 - The *_killable* functions should be exported for use by modules.
 - The down_killable implementation needs to check fatal_signal_pending,
   not signal_pending.
 - The task state needs to be set to TASK_KILLABLE, not
   TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
It should only take a couple of minutes to verify your architecture.
