This is normal. AFAIK this is the documented behavior when you read
directly from a serial port.

Mice are handled from userspace; either the gpm daemon or the X server.
I really see no reason to have mouse drivers in the kernel, we should
only have the bare minimum needed to access them from userspace, e.g.
serial port/usb/busmouse stuff.
There are mouse routines you can link to from userspace distributed with
gpm, (libgpm) I suggest that you snag the source and take a look. Of
course, this is assuming that you want to use mice for the text console.
You might also want to take a look at what the GGI/KGI people are doing
WRT mice. They seem to have a pretty good thing going with video and
keyboards.

Definitely look at GGI/KGI. You might also want to sift through the
SVGAlib source, as I believe that it handles mice and other input.
