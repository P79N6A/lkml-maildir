Hi!
Every second playback using maestro produces bad quality output. I'm using
splay and -test8. Also sound quality degrades _after_ dropout caused by
slow disk. Any ideas how to fix that?

PS: This has happened before. With festival I got fun stuff where sometimes
sound was commng from left speaker only and sometimes from right only...
It changed with reopening /dev/dsp.
