Interesting, this one was fixed in 2.6.22-rc6, but is neither in 2.6.20
nor in 2.6.21. Michal, could you please try to apply the patch ? I include
it here for your convenience. If it fixes your problem, I can queue it for
next 2.6.20-stable, and forward it to the -stable team for 2.6.21 in case
Greg and Chris plan to release another one.
