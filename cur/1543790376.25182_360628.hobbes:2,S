Subject: yet another c language cross-reference for linux
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have written another cross-referencing tool for the c language because I
have been dissatisfied with existing tools such as ctags and lxr.  I'd like
to get some feedback to determine whether other programmers find the program
useful so I'm making the program script and a database for the linux-2.4.31
kernel available for download from my web site www.pjalbrecht.com. If you're
interested, download the program script and linux database from my web site;
try the program; and send me your comments. I'm particularly interested in
comparing my approach with other cross-reference programs like ctags and
lxr. I don't usually read the linux-kernel mailing list so please cc me if
you answer/comment to the list in response to this message.
