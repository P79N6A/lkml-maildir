The key bit in the dump is this:

Interrupts are not getting routed correctly for your motherboard
in the 2.4.19pre release you are running.  I'm not sure what has
changed there, but the aic7xxx driver is noticing, when told to
abort a command, that it has already completed, but the interrupt
for that completion was never received.  You may see different
results if you play with the APIC I/O option.
