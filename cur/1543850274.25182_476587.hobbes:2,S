This has nothing to do with whether DMA is enabled and is wrong. The
decision about whether to honour BIOS DMA settings is a config option
and has been for years.
If this specific laptop does need not to use DMA, and Win*** also shows
the same behaviour then we can certainly add it to a list of some kind,
OTOH if windows DMA works I'd like to know -why-
