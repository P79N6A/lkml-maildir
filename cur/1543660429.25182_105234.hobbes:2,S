Just to chime in, are you using the qlogicfc driver that comes with the
kernel? If so, Try using qlogic's 6.01 driver set instead and see if
your problem goes away. I've had other problems, mostly stack related,
but I've since found my fixes and will be rolling another kernel into
production soon, but keeping that driver version. I've got qla2300's and
2200's using 6.01.
I believe the kernel driver is still based on 5.38 or less driver
version, which has problems like you're experiencing.
