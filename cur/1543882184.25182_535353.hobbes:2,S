Subject: [PATCH] sysfs: use different lockdep subclass for s_active deactivation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/26/281

A sysfs node can delete other sysfs files when accessed.  This results
in recursive s_active locking - read lock for file access, down lock
of the vicitim for deactivation.  Tell lockdep that it's okay.

Miles, please test this patch.  It should remove the lockdep warning.
Fixes for the other two problems will soon follow.
Greg, Andrew, after all the fixes are verified, I'll merge the fixes
into the original patches and resend all the sysfs updates in better
shape.  Sorry about all the trouble.
Thanks.
