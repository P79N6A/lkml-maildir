You can try it, but if that fixes the problem I'll buy a sombrero and then eat 
it.

True, not equivalent in all cases, but correct. For non-kdump kernels (which I 
assume this is) KERNELBASE == PAGE_OFFSET, and for a kdump kernel that code 
wants to use PAGE_OFFSET, not KERNELBASE.
Try enabling early debugging (see arch/powerpc/kernel/setup_64.c) and then 
turning on DEBUG in hash_utils_64.c, setup_64.c etc.
