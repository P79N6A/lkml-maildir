i've done dozens of patches that saved much less of text size, so yes, i 
very much care about code size. But it has been stated in this thread 
that most of the _p() API uses in the kernel today are bogus. So 
eventually getting rid of the bogus ones will be a net code size 
_reduction_. (But even that is besides the point, we prefer clean and 
easier to maintain code.)

ok, "I dont know but it might be slower" is a perfectly fine statement 
instead of your original "it will be slower".
