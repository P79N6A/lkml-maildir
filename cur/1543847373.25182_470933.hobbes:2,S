My most recent patch solves all the known issues to my knowledge. 
However, it is written with very little understanding of the reasons 
behind the quirk. Alan Cox posted some info but having just started a 
real job I haven't had time to go into this stuff in detail.
I think Greg has queued this patch for 2.6.19 but wouldn't be surprised 
if people object to it...
