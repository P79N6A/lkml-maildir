Well, I didn't realize that unionfs required its backing filesystems
to be mounted.  That's more like having the block device open in a
text editor while mounting ext3.  In the presence of such a design, an
oops clearly is not acceptable.  And this sort of design is just what
I was talking about when I said:

You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks
occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a
speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.
