Subject: Re: [RFC v12][PATCH 01/14] Create syscalls: sys_checkpoint, sys_restart

* Oren Laadan <orenl@cs.columbia.edu> [2008-12-29 04:16:14]:
> Create trivial sys_checkpoint and sys_restore system calls. They will
> enable to checkpoint and restart an entire container, to and from a
> checkpoint image file descriptor.
> 
> The syscalls take a file descriptor (for the image file) and flags as
> arguments. For sys_checkpoint the first argument identifies the target
> container; for sys_restart it will identify the checkpoint image.
> 
> A checkpoint, much like a process coredump, dumps the state of multiple
> processes at once, including the state of the container. The checkpoint
> image is written to (and read from) the file descriptor directly from
> the kernel. This way the data is generated and then pushed out naturally
> as resources and tasks are scanned to save their state. This is the
> approach taken by, e.g., Zap and OpenVZ.
> 
> By using a return value and not a file descriptor, we can distinguish
> between a return from checkpoint, a return from restart (in case of a
> checkpoint that includes self, i.e. a task checkpointing its own
> container, or itself), and an error condition, in a manner analogous
> to a fork() call.
> 
> We don't use copyin()/copyout() because it requires holding the entire
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Do you mean get_user_pages(),
copy_to/from_user()?
> image in user space, and does not make sense for restart.  Also, we
> don't use a pipe, pseudo-fs file and the like, because they work by
> generating data on demand as the user pulls it (unless the entire
> image is buffered in the kernel) and would require more complex logic.
> They also would significantly complicate checkpoint that includes self.
