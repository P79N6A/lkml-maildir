Adrian, if you're interested in tackling this "fun" problem,
have a look at add_preferred_console() and find a way to make
that not marked __init. (it's called by sunserial_console_match)
That's what causes this dependency chain of __init problems for the
Sun serial console drivers.
It's problematic, furthermore, because even if one could call
add_preferred_console() from a module properly, it doesn't have the
desired effect of changing init's stdin/stdout/stderr
