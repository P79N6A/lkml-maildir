We add SBP-2 devices when they are detected on the FireWire bus.
The status with sbp2 (after the patch) is:
  - sbp2 calls scsi_add_device and scsi_remove_device when an SBP-2
    logical unit comes and goes away.
  - In between those, the user may call scsi_remove_device and
    optionally scsi_add_device via SCSI core's userspace interfaces
    and will get the device removed and re-added, respectively.
However, the latter is an utter useless pastime.  And so would be
scsi_transport_template.user_scan().
Implementing scsi_host_template.scan_finished() is logged to be done as
a possible feature addition.  It has ultra-low priority on my to-do list
though because the drivers have only little more knowledge than
userspace has about when all existing devices at a point in time might
have been discovered.
