	Yep, tons of these :
-----------------------------------------------
-        IRDA_DEBUG(4, __FUNCTION__ "(), speed=%d (was %d)\n", speed, 
-		   self->speed);
+        IRDA_DEBUG(4, "%s(), speed=%d (was %d)\n", __FUNCTION__,
+        	speed, self->speed);
-----------------------------------------------
	Between this and fixing a Oops or Deadlock, I'll take the
second any day.
	I don't care on those patch in general, I'm not a control
freak, except that being so pervasive they are guaranteed to screw up
my own patches. That's why yesterday I *explicitely* asked you and
Alan if anything was pending, so that I could avoid wasting my time
and instead wait for the next release doing something else.
	I guess it's too late, I already wasted my afternoon.
	The second thing that bugs me is that because those patches
pass behind my back, they won't get applied to *both* 2.4.X and
2.5.X. Because of that, keeping 2.4.X and 2.5.X in synch is an
exercise in futility.
	But maybe you are finding that there is already too many IrDA
maintainers.
	I'll send you the Wireless patches, and I'll try to respin the
IrDA patches this afternoon (i.e. please screw me again !).
	Regards,
	Jean
