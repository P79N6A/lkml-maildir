Would it be useful/desirable/possible to have a button in the defect to
allow you to forward the important info about it to an email address? 
For instance, if I wanted to bring it to the attention of linux-mm?
That being said, I guess this should have been the first question:
Should bugs reported to bugme still be posted here (or elsewhere when
appropriate)?  I would assume so, at least for a while.
