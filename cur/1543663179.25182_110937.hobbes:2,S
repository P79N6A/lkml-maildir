Hi,
 yes, indeed, this was the problem!!! (by the way: HURRAY, IT BOOTS!)
 It seems that loading an "old" config file from the 2.4.*-series
 of linux kernels will WIPE OUT that config items since they are not 
 written back to disk anymore when saving kernel configuartions....
 Another thing is that make menuconfig fails to write back
 configurations as alternate files into directories owned by root
 and set drwxr-xr-x....but it is able to write into the . directory,
 even if it is set with drwxr-xr-x also...
 
 But this is only a sideeffect.
 Keep Hacking!
