Are you using DRI? There is some evidence that exiting and restarting X
will not correctly re-initialize the DRI stuff in the kernel, and
_massive_ kernel memory corruption can ensure when the new X server
starts. 
At which point you'll get random oopses etc.

Looks like you at least have the DRI kernel modules there.
Try to see if the problem goes away if you start X without DRI support
(ie remove the "Load 'dri'" or whatever from the XF86Config file, or
start up in a mode that DRI doesn't support, like 8bpp).
