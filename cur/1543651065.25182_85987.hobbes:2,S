Well, never mind the ncr53c8xx driver--the problem appears to be 
in the SCSI core code.  I threw in a QLogic ISP1040 controller 
and had much the same results.  Only difference is, I'm not sure 
how to gather debug output from the qlogicisp driver.  All I 
have is the QLogic driver freezing at about the same point...
