Sorry, my typo - I  meant /proc/driver/rtc. The source is 
drivers/char/rtc.c and it does 
create_proc_read_entry ("driver/rtc", 0, 0, rtc_read_proc, NULL);
in addition to the binary-data device /dev/rtc (which is in
/dev/misc/rtc of devfs). The /proc/driver/rtc is the human-readable dump
of RTC data and I thought it should find its proper place in devfs instead
of /proc for the same reasons why we moved microcode from /proc/driver to
/dev/cpu.

ok, then it could go to /dev/misc/rtc.txt?
Thank you for reviewing my patch.

Tigran.
