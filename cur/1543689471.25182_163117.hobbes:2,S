Nicely put.  But the last step, ->beowulf, doesn't fit with the others, 
because all the other steps are successive levels of virtualization that try 
to preserve the appearance of a single system, whereas Beowulf drops the 
pretence and lets applications worry about the boundaries, i.e., it lacks 
essential SSI features.  Also, the hardware changes on each of the first four 
arrows and stays the same on the last one.
