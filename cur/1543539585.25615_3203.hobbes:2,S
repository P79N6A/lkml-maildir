Yes. What's MORE amusing that it WAS fixed. For years I had this small jumper
on my MB to disable writes to flash BIOS.

Great idea. Perhaps 10 years later we'll have such system. For now we have
no choices: some work with video cards NEED access to hardware (acceleration;
and you DO NOT want acceleration to go via the kernel, really).

It IS possible. Remove CAP_SYS_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_RAW capabilities from
system. Yes, perhaps patch to require CAP_SYS_RAW for RAW ide commands
can go in. It's quite different thing then proposed papering over hole.
