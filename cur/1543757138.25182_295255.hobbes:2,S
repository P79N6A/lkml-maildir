No, the check is still there, I just removed the printk if 0xaa55 isn't found 
(my box returns 0x303 instead).

I thought the signature described what type of ROM was there?  E.g. 0xaa55 
means x86 ROM, x0303 means OF ROM, etc.?
At any rate, not having a ROM at all (which my case may be) isn't an error 
either, so I think removing the printk is appropriate regardless.
Thanks,
Jesse
