Marcelo,
This patch didn't make it into 2.4.21.  Zou Pengcheng's original patch
was whitespace-damaged, so here's a fresh copy against 2.4.21.
Issue DN_MODIFY on writev, and DN_ACCESS on readv, rather than vice versa.
I can provide a testcase if anyone wants one.

Subject: [PATCH] dnotify fix for readv/writev (Linux 2.4.20)

hi, Marcelo,
this is a patch to fix the dnotify bug of readv/writev. 
Orignally DN_MODIFY is issued on readv while DN_ACCESS is issued on writev, 
which is obviously wrong. This patch fixes such problem.
cheers,
