Great. So, the problem is in i8042.c untranslating the keycodes. Please
also enable #define I8042_DEBUG_IO in drivers/input/serio/i8042.h, don't
start X, enable maximum console loglevel by "echo 16 16 16 16 >
/proc/sys/kernel/printk", and press the killing key combination.
(without i8042_direct, of course). Then send me the ten last or so lines
printed. This should allow me to fix the problem. Thanks.
