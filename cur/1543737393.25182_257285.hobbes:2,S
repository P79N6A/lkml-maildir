Jon, this is a common misconception - GATOS km module *does* provide a v4l 
interface.
What is different is that the device configuration (like setting the tuner 
or encoding) is done by Xserver.
All km does is check whether the card can supply a v4l stream and, if so, 
it provides it. This is little different from a webcam driver, especially
if a webcam has its own on/off switch.
The misconception arises from the fact that many v4l programs were only 
made to work with bt848 cards - they would *not* work with webcams any
more than they would work with km.
