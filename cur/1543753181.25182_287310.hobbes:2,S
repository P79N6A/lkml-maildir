What exactly do you want to audit for?
If it's only for "ordinary" bugs, that's simply not feasible.
The amount of patches going into 2.6 is currently at about 3 MB every 
week. You can hardly keep up with all of that - and even if you were 
able to do so, some theoretically correct patch might break in practice 
due to hardware bugs or bugs in some toolchain.
Regarding security audits:
They aren't a bad idea, and not bound to new patches - much legacy code 
in the kernel has for sure more bugs than new code. The linus-kernel way 
for such a project is not to scream "We need SOMETHING" - the 
linux-kernel way is that you start with the work to get the ball rolling 
(and if other people are interested to work in the same area, give them 
some guidance).
