Chandra, virtual container number is essentially the same as user id
in non-container environment. UBC were desgined for _users_ first.
Containers were just the first environment which started to use it widely.
And I really disagree when you say that non-container usecase is
a superset of container usecase. I believe it is vice versa, since
in container usecase you have a _full_ environment with root user and need
more resources to be taken into account.
Thanks,
