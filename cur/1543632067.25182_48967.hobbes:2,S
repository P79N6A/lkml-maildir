Not sure where the typos came from but here they are:
                        printk(KERN_INFO "%s: Route Added Successfully: %u.%u.%u.%U\n",
Should be          printk(KERN_INFO "%s: Route Added Successfully: %u.%u.%u.%U\n",
                        printk(KERN_INFO "%s: mask %u.%u.%u.%u\n",
                                card->devname, NIPQUAD(in_dev->ida_list->ifa_mask));
                                printk(KERN_INFO "%s: local %u.%u.%u.%u\n",
                                card->devname,NIPQUAD(in_dev->ida_list->ifa_local));
Should be ifa_list -- not ida_list
