The essential part of the patch is a patch of drivers/block/ide.c like
        /* calculate drive capacity, and select LBA if possible */
-       (void) current_capacity (drive);
+       capacity = current_capacity (drive);
 
-       /* Correct the number of cyls if the bios value is too small */
-       if (drive->sect == drive->bios_sect && drive->head == drive->bios_head) {
-               if (drive->cyl > drive->bios_cyl)
-                       drive->bios_cyl = drive->cyl;
-       }
+       /* Set the cylinder count - the BIOS reported value may be too small */
+       if (capacity >= (drive->bios_cyl * drive->bios_sect * drive->bios_head) &&
+           (!drive->forced_geom) && drive->bios_sect && drive->bios_head)
+               drive->bios_cyl = (capacity / drive->bios_sect) / drive->bios_head;
(I gave it a few months ago.)
Below a somewhat longer patch that I constructed a moment ago
by making a source halfway Alan's 2.0.37pre8 and my own.
Andries
[P.S. Recently someone remarked that Linux would get into a loop
at boot time with an appropriately constructed extended partition table.
I left the trivial patch in.]
[P.S.2 Let me take this opportunity to advertise
ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/aeb/getbios/
* a bit more. This contains a kernel patch
for 2.2.2 and a C program getbiosdrivedata.c, where the kernel patch collects
BIOS information at boot time, and the C program interprets the results.
The idea is to eventually remove all geometry knowledge from the kernel
(it isnt needed there) to a library used by LILO and fdisk.
The most difficult problem is finding the correspondence between the BIOS
disks 0x80, 0x81, ... and the Linux disks /dev/sda, /dev/hda, ...
A dozen people or so already sent a report, but the variation is large,
different BIOSes have different bugs, and I need many more. Please, if you
have a spare half hour and either a very new BIOS or a lot of disks,
try this out and mail me the output. - aeb@cwi.nl.]
