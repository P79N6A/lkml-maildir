Hi,
  Using VMWare 4 with a 2.6.9 kernel I get "IO-APIC + timer doesn't work!" 
As suggested, the noapic option fixes the problem. This resulted after 
adding APIC support to my kernel. My problem is, I need APIC support to boot 
on a separate, non-VMWare machine, and I need to keep the kernel and boot 
params the same on both machines.
  Aside from disabling APIC support, and running with the noapic parameter, 
can anybody suggest how to get this running on the VMware machine?
Thank you in advance,
Joseph
