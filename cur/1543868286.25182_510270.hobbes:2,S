for the most part, that doesn't matter to me one way or the other but,
personally, i'd make obsolete kernel features default to "n".  after
all, if someone has gone to the trouble to actually make that config
option *depend* on OBSOLETE, that's a powerful argument that you
should have to work a bit to get it back again. :-)
but i'm good either way.
