When I strace a pthreaded program with the follow fork option the threads
get serialized, e.g., if I start threads A and B in my program, thread A
gets interrupted and thread B runs uninterrupted to completion, then A
starts up again and runs to completion.  Has any one else noticed this
behavior? Is there a way to strace -f a multithreaded program with
concurrency?
