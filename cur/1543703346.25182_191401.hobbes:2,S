Thank you!
That was the key thing I was missing. With this setting the PATA drives show
up on /dev/hd{a,b,c,d} and the SATA drives show up on /dev/sd{a,b} (using
ata_piix). And everything seems to work pretty well in 2.6.1.
I've only tried the PATA hard drive and reading from cdrom. I haven't tried
burning cds or playing a dvd yet.
