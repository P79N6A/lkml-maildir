Alan,
A couple of questions if you please.
1)  When I compile the siimage driver into the kernel, the ide buses are 
scanned in the following order:
  IDE0 - SATA primary - hda, hdb
  IDE1 - SATA secondary - hdc, hdd
  IDE2 - ATA tertiary - hde, hdf
  IDE3 - ATA quandrary hdg, hdh
I want the ATA to be IDE0/1  and SATA to be IDE2/3.  I have noticed from 
some of the posts about the siimage driver on the ASUS nforce2 mobo this 
is the apparent order scanned.  My mobo is an Abit NF7-S nforce2.  Is 
there someway of controlling the order of scannin the IDE buses?  I 
tried append="ide=reverse" to no avail.
2) To try and get the nforce2 IDE buses scanned first, I compiled 
siimage as a module, but when I did an "insmod siimage" I get an 
unresolved external, "noautodma", in siimage.
I'd appreciate any help you can offer.
Thanks,
John Copeland
