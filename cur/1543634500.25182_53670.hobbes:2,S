I'd rather have redundancy than have horrible names like just "0", thank
you very much.
It takes up no space, all the dentries are virtual anyway, and a dentry
embeds the storage for the first n characters (n ~16 or something like
that).

There is _no_ excuse for being terse.
Also, never EVER use special characters like "@" unless there is _reason_
to use them. I don't see any reason to make a filesystem look like perl.
Please use sane names like "disknnn" over insane cryptographically secure
filesystem contents like "sd@nnn".
