See? Sector # is increasing... Linux retries the read several times,
then reports EIO to userspace and goes to next sectors. Unfortunately,
they are bad too, so the loop repeats. Eventually it will pass
by all bad sectors (if not, it's a bug) but it can take longish
time.
Apart of making max retry # settable by the user, I don't see how
this can be made better. Pity. This is common problem on CDs...
