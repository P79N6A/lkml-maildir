Sure, our current kprobes model is very serialized where in we serve only
one kprobe in the exception handler by holding this lock_kprobes() and
release this lock i.e unlock_kprobes() when we are done with single stepping

In the kprobe exception handling we relay on kprobe_cpu = smp_processor_id() to determine
whether we are inside the kprobe or not. It was so happeing that when we
take the lock and before kprobe_cpu gets updated if an H/W interrupt happens
and if kprobe is enabled on ISR routine, then in the kprobe execption handler
for isr, we miss the indication that we are already in kprobes(since interrupt
happened before we get to update kprobe_cpu) and we were trying to 
take the lock again and there by causing the deadlock. This deadlock is avoided
by disabling the ISR for a short period while we take the spin_lock() and update
the kprobe_cpu.

This whole serialization will go away when we introduce the scalability patch.
