Hi there,
do you like the technical discussions about OS development on
linux-kernel? 
But you also like to discuss, how other operating systems do it?
Or you like to share some research results about a new approach
in memory management or overall OS architecture (like
exokernels)?
Then join os-devel by sending mail to majordomo@tu-chemnitz.de
containing the single line
subscribe os-devel
in the BODY of the message.
List language is English, the rest will be explained after
subscribing. It is also a closed list (to prevent spamming).
See you there!
Regards
Ingo Oeser
