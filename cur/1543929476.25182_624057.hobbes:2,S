Distributed storage.
I'm pleased to announce the 10'th release of the distributed
storage subsystem (DST). This is a maintenance release and includes
bug fixes and simple feature extensions only.
DST allows to form a storage on top of local and remote nodes
and combine them into linear or mirroring setup, which in
turn can be exported to remote nodes.
Short changelog:
 * fixed bug with XFS metadata update (it can provide slab pages to the
	DST, so it is not allowed to transfer them using ->sendpage())
 * fixed async error completion path
 * extended netlink communication channel to report errors back to userspace
 * DST name is now "The 10'th dynasty of smuggled slothes"
 * number of fixes for userspace DST target
Great thanks to Matthew Hodgson <matthew@mxtelecom.com> for debugging and
fixes for userspace DST target and preliminary netlink extension patches.
Overall list of features of the DST can be found on project's homepage:
