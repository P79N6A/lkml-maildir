Ive compilled and installed 2.6.0-test11 on redhat 8 in order to filter
packets based on some patterns in layer 7 (l7-filter.sourceforge.net)
So, ive installed the kernel, and installed module-init-tools-0.9.14 too.
The kernel works fine, all modules too but i have to insert them with insmod
or modprobe, i cannot make that modules became loaded automatically.
Ive compiled the kernel with CONFIG_KMOD=Y
any help?
Thanks
