The only thing volatile on an asm does is create a side effect
on the asm statement; in effect, it tells the compiler "do not
remove this asm even if you don't need any of its outputs".
It's not disabling optimisation likely to result in bugs,
heisen- or otherwise; _not_ putting the volatile on an asm
that needs it simply _is_ a bug :-)
