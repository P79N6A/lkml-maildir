Nice fiction - stuff crashes eventually - not that this isn't useful. For
a long time simply loading a 2-3GB Ramdisk off hard disk has been a good
way to build things like compile engines where loss of state is not bad.

Ext3 is only going to help you if the ramdisk writeback respects barriers
and ordering rules ?

Why not - providing you clear the dirty bit before the write and you
check it again after ? And on the disk size as you are going to have to
suck all the content back in presumably a log structure is not a big
concern ?

If you are prepared to go bigger than the fs chunk size so lose the
ordering guarantees your chunk size really ought to be *big* IMHO
