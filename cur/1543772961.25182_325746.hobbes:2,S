Well the __documented__ '486 LEA instruction doesn't
even allow the double-register indirect. It's just
 	LEA r16,m
 	LEA r32,m
... repeated twice
Page 26-190,  Intel486(tm) Microprocessor Programmer's Reference
Manual. ISBN 1-55512-195-4. The instruction may have been one
of those "immature features", read broken.
Cheers,
