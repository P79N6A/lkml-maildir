Hi srinivas,
     My question is "We are having lot more printk
statements in the kernel source files. While the
kernel is in execution where the output of all these
statements will go? and can we redirect the output of
printk to our console?
     Please help me. Also I have one more error after
having compiled my new kernel 2.6.9. After booting it
shows the following error
"Kernel panic syncing unable to mount block(0,0) VFS
specify root =LABEL correctly"
  Do u know how to deal with it?
Thanks,
selva
