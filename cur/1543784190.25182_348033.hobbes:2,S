It would seem to depends on the locality of reference in the affected files.
Which implies to me that the locality of libc, etc probably sucks, though
we had a simple debug patch somewhere to print out a bitmap of which pages
are faulted in and which are not ... was somewhere, I'll see if I can find
it.
