I can still use my IDE controller but device read timings on ATA133 harddrives show that they can only put out about 3M/sec which isn't acceptable.  Does anyone know of any support for the 645dx/5513 combo (961B)?  Or does anyone know a way I can make a quick hack on sis5513.c so that I can support my controller, even if its not to its fullest potential?
