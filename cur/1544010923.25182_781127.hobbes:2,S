Hi.
This small patchset extendes existing commands with reset, master IO and
status messages. Reset is used to reset the bus for given master device,
master IO command allows to initiate IO against bus itself not selecting
slave device first, which can be used to probe the device for example.
And status messages carry command completion status back to the
userspace (namely very useful to get -ENODEV from when requested device
was not found).
Great thanks to Paul Alfille <paul.alfille@gmail.com> of OWFS for
testing and commands suggestions.
