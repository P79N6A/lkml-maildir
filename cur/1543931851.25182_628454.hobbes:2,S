That's something I've actually never quite liked... the fact that we
evaluate the expression anyway. I'm pretty happy with -not- evaluating
the expression when CONFIG_BUG is on most of the time since whatever is
in there is purely here for the sake of the BUG/WARN test.
I understand why some people may want it the other way around, but I
personally find it a very bad idea in the first place to write a normal
statement part of the program as
	BUG_ON(do_something());
It's way clearer to me I believe to write:
	rc = do_something();
	BUG_ON(rc);
And thus, when I write:
	BUG_ON(do_sanity_check());
I'm actually execting the function call to disappear when CONFIG_BUG
is turned off...
Cheers,
Ben.
