The patch attempted to emulate the original bytecodes that as86/ld86
output wherever possible. In an instruction by instruction disassembly,
the new boot code differs only by a few bytes (or less with a recent
binutils). Each 32 bit instruction in the original code was replaced by
a 32 bitter in mine, and I don't recall adding or removing any: it was
simply meant to be a "transcription" more than a cleanup (at least at
this point).
I was looking to first get rid of the as86 dependency first, leaving
just a bootable kernel with gas bootcode. Later, not too long from now, the
plan has been to send out the next round of patches which will clean up,
beautify, clarify, optimize and otherwise make wonderful the bootcode.
I guess I could have done it all at once, but I just don't feel like
that would have been the best way to do it -- I wanted the 'lowest
common denominator' before the 'super-duper ultra-tricked'.

Subject: bootsect.S changes
Hi,
    As I see the i386 bootsect code evaluates into 32 bit code.
Could anybody explain me what is the reason ?
32-bit code is in most cases a bit larger (one byte per statement)
but in the bootsector every byte is very valuable. Are there any problems
with 16-bit code? (compilation? non-working on some machines?)
What are the advantages of the following code:
        movw    $128, %cx
        subw    %si, %si
        subw    %di, %di
        cld
        rep
        movsl                   <------- 32 bit
instead of
        movw    $256, %cx
        subw    %si, %si
        subw    %di, %di
        cld
        rep
        movsw                   <------- 16 bit
(which is shorter), etc.
I hope, nobody will joke saying it is faster ...
Regards
   Andrzej
PS. IMHO, using 32-bit code in bootsect.S/setup.S makes sense only
    if it is really necessary to handle 32-bit addresses/data or it
    is shorter. Am I wrong?
