There was a bug where instructions with a modrm byte specifying a 
register would try to access memory.  In the memory was not mapped,  
emulation would fail. vmcall is one such instruction.  This was fixed by

    KVM: x86 emulator: fix access registers for instructions with ModR/M 
byte and Mod = 3
    The patch belows changes the access type to register from memory for
    instructions that are declared as SrcMem or DstMem, but have a
    ModR/M byte with Mod = 3.
    It fixes (at least) the lmsw and smsw instructions on an AMD64 CPU,
    which are needed for FreeBSD.
