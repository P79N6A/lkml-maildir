I've been experiencing something similar to this.
With 2.6.0-test4+ if I start X, and switch consoles back and forth
randomly, eventually the system will lock hard. I am unable to get a panic
dump because the system state is completely dead (except oddly, the
numlock key still works w/ LED).
I am unsure why this is ocurring or if this is related to this issue.
Thanks,
Shawn S.

In repeating those five commands, is there any purpose to the first
sleep?  I left the first sleep in place to match the original, but once
I assume sync leaves no writes unflushed then now I do not see what the
first sleep accomplishes, if anything.

Today 2.4.21-xfs Knoppix booted via cd:
in over 75 cycles I saw no crash so I gave up.
Today 2.4.22 with a near default .config:
"in over 75 cycles I saw no crash so I gave up".
Today 2.6.0-test4 with a near default .config:
Counting cycles before crash per boot I saw: 3 2 16 ...
Yester/today 2.6.0-test5 with a near default .config:
"I saw: 1 18 20 20 ... 4 16 ..." 3 ...
> -test5, post (as tar.bz2) ...
After that last -test5 crash I rebooted and then produced the attached
via:
#!/bin/bash
# rm -r chvtx
mkdir chvtx
sudo /sbin/lspci -v >>chvtx/v.lspci
sudo cat /var/log/dmesg >>chvtx/var.log.dmesg
egrep -i 'version|release|driver' /var/log/XFree86.*.log
>>chvtx/var.log.XFree86.log
# cp -ip /var/log/XFree86.*.log chvtx/
cp -ip .config chvtx/config
tar -c chvtx | bzip2 -zc >chvtx.2.6.0-test5.tar.bz2
