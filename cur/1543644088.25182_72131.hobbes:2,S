Okay, figured that one out (c.f. x86_udelay_tsc thread). I'll grind out
another one in about 90-120 minutes or thereabouts with HZ == 100. I'm
going to take a wild guess param.h should have an #ifdef there for
NR_CPUS >= WLI_SAW_EXCESS_TIMER_INTS_HERE or something. It's probably
possible to figure out what the service time vs. arrival rate stuff says
but it's too easy to fix to be worth analyzing, and we don't exist to
process timer ticks anyway. Hrm, yet another cry for i386 subarches?
Hanna, did you have a particular dcache patch in mind? ISTR there were
several flavors. (I can of course sift through them myself as well.)
Cheers,
Bill
