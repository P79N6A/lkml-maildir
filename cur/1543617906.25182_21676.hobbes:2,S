I remember that previous debian release come with a patched kernel to
allow live upgrade. It was explained in the FAQ that the patch was
required for this purpose.
   7.2 Debian claims to be able to update a running program;
      how is this accomplished?
The debian FAQ has been updated because now debian uses a pristine
kernel.
What was in this patch?
