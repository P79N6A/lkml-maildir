	No I haven't fix the problem... I'am waiting for a friend that is in 
holiday's and work's with linux well. I'am beginer in linux and I can't put 
the patch to work, because of that I'am waiting for him to see if the patch 
work. 
	Sorry, the fact I don't say anything about the problem but my friend comes 
this week and them we put the patch and I will tell something!!
Regards, Paulo.
