If the end result is a PANIC, then no, then scrollback keys do not work. 
Also note that the kernel generates a lot of noise^W text - if now the 
start scripts from $YOUR_FAVORITE_DISTRO also fill up, I can barely reach 
the top of the kernel when it says
  Linux version 2.6.15 (jengelh@gwdg-wb04.gwdg.de) (gcc version 4.0.2 
  20050901 (prerelease) (SUSE Linux)) #1 Tue Jan 3 09:21:27 CET 2006
Plus, if you happen to oops away, panic away or just get a "VFS root
unmountable" during kernel _boot_, you cannot use scrollback either.
So to say, scrollback starts working (for me) when INIT is spawned.
