The OS doesn't have enough information to be able to save the app's data 
in the event of a crash in a form that would be usable or meaningful, 
since only the app knows what format its data structures are in.
The app itself could do this (installing a signal handler for segfaults, 
etc.) but the problem is that whatever caused the program to crash may 
have also left its data in a messed-up state.
