I presume you have an MPC default type 5 motherboard.
The MP-1.4 specs are largely silent on what you are supposed to do in this 
situation (which is why HP implemented an ELCR I suppose).  I'm really loth to 
have the general case rely on a value returned from a register that isn't 
there.
As I see it, there are two possibilities for handling this:
1) code an exception in the IO-APIC setup that recognises the board from it's 
id strings (if it provides them anywhere) and read the ELCR in this special 
case.
2) PCI interrupts are by spec defined to be level in this situation, so put a 
hook into the PCI code for informing the IO-APIC code when it finally locates 
an interrupt.  If we find this interrupt on an ISA bus, we set it to level 
instead of edge.
I think it's going to turn out that your board won't have an easy 
identification string, so 2) is probably the correct way to go.  However, I'd 
like the PCI people to comment on this before I code it for you to try.
