Why shift at all?
int ffs(u32 word)
{
    int bit = 0;
    word &= -word; // only keep the lsb.
    if (word & 0xffff0000) bit |= 16;
    if (word & 0xff00ff00) bit |=  8;
    if (word & 0xf0f0f0f0) bit |=  4;
    if (word & 0xcccccccc) bit |=  2;
    if (word & 0xaaaaaaaa) bit |=  1;
    return bit;
}
