With a cpu intensive program running in the background on a two cpu Pentium
system, something like `void main() { while (1); }` interactive performance
goes down the toilet.  Something like holding space is clearly jumping
accross the screen.  I'm not sure where this started.
Also I had errors like this, 
DFries kernel: EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,2)): 
ext2_new_block: Free blocks count corrupted for block group 450
followed by duplicate blocks.  Basically part of my linux-net mail folder
got replaced by another file.  I think I'll head back to the 2.2 series.
