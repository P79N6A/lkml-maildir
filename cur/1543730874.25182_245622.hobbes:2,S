It's really userland programming 101 :)
 you need to fstat after open to really check that no one swtiched the
 path below you to a fifo or device, O_DIRECTORY gets that directly in
 the open call, with the additional benefit of making sure you don't
 get any of the sideeffects at all that would happen if you're opening
 a device file.
 the current reiser4 semantics break that and as soon as you're having a
 world-writeable (e.g. /tmp) dir on it and someone is doing an opendir
 on it he's lost.
