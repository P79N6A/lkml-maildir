As I commented on IRC to Val Henson - the XFS performance indicates
that it is not a VFS or Samba problem.
I'd say it's probably delayed allocation that is making the
difference here - no allocation occurs on the single byte writes, it
occurs when the larger data writes are flushed to disk. Hence no
adverse fragmentation will occur and there wil be no extra
allocations being done.
Hence I think it's probably a filesystm problem - it would be
interesting to see how ext4 performs on this workload....
Cheers,
Dave.
