The context, of course, is an attempt to fix -ENOPATCH with regard to
the netlink-based AIO submission scheme I outlined a couple of days
ago.  :-)
Maybe f_pos should be advanced atomically by the number of bytes
expected to be read/written, before entering the vfs_(read|write)(|v)
call?  And then if the read/write doesn't complete normally, f_pos
should be decremented by the number of bytes we failed to read/write?
Or do we have to make absolutely, positively sure that sampling f_pos
from another thread never returns any value outside (before)..(before
+ bytes read/written)?  If so, the only way to cure the worst symptom
of the append race appears to be to hold a per-fd lock for the
duration of the sys_(read|write).
Cheers,
