They are without p option so the function name is not there. Though
there is only one patch 02 of 05 that modifies existing code.  And that
too almost all single line changes are starting with container API
container_*  Please let me know if there is something specific that is
not clear.
I will send the next version of patches and I will include -p option as
well.
