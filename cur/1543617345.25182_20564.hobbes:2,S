I will meditate over the last paragraph later. I decided to follow your 
first advice...
I think, this is worth a note in the reiserfs-FAQ. And remember: allmost
all linux distributions will use 3.5 to ensure backward compatibility.
Also note, that web man page and mkreiserfs -h disagree on the -v option.
I will believe mkreiserfs.
If I use notail mount option on a already populated partition, what happens
to the "tailed" files? I expect, only newly created ones get there own block.
