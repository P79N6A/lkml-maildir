What is on screen? Correct 640x480 picture?

Do you use matroxfb-2.5.72 patch or not? You are not supposed to use
fbset on stock 2.6.x kernel (without patch above), you should use
stty cols & rows to set videomode under 2.6.x kernels (you can try
using fbset -pixclock to set refresh, but never change picture size
through fbset).
