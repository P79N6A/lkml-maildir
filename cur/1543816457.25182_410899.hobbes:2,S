[Andi, Jon, sorry if you receive multiple copies of this - mercurial's
patchbomb is subtle and quick to anger]
This patchset introduces support for the Calgary IOMMU found on IBM's
high end xSeries servers. It fixes almost all of the issues Andi
raised (details in the individual patches). In particular, X works
fine now - we no longer enable translation on PHB0 by default.
Comments and testing in -mm appreciated!
Cheers,
Muli
