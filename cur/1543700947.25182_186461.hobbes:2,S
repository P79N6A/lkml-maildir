OK, the following patch from Andrew fixes it up 80% or so, but I still 
don't think it's as good as test2 was - turning on whole-frag seems to
fix the rest of it. It's much more difficult to tell now though, so I'd 
like other people's opinions on it. If you want to switch between the
two, the above switches it on, and:
# echo 'clear' > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss
switches whole-frag back off. I'm using a 192kbps MP3 to test it, repeating
the first 30s of the same song again and again (I'm gonna hate that song 
soon ;-)). Different bitrates might give better differentation of the problem.
Please, please experiment with this, and let us know.
