Not really. The thing is, CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR has never done anything 
at all, now it does, and it shows that it never worked.
So the commit that made it do something shouldn't be reverted, but 
CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR should be marked BROKEN, because it obviously is 
broken right now.
But keeping the config option, and just not making it do anything is 
misleading and wrong.
So just something like this? To make sure normal people don't enable it..
