Please just use common sense.  It depends upon how intrusive the
change is.  In most cases, the driver author's have to learn to
"let go" and let these general cleanups happen.  The onus is on
them to follow upstream when the submit new changes of their own.
Some examples:
1) Deleting superfluous header file.
   Just do a clean sweep.
2) Adding a new argument to an existing interface.
   Just do a clean sweep.
3) Transitioning drivers over to a new exception handling mechanism.
   Probably want to do submit a patch for driver at a time.  You
   should be doing more a few of these driver conversions at a time
   anyways, so no risk of patch bombing.
4) Straight forward transformations, for example hiding data
   structure member access behind a function or macro.
   Just do a clean sweep in large chunks.
Again, use common sense.  If you're just crossing your "T"'s and
dotting your "i"'s, don't spam everyone with a thousand patches
for such a cleanup.
