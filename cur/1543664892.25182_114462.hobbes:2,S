Hi,
I've uploaded a new version of ipsec-tools to sourceforge.
IPsec-Tools is a port of KAME's "libipsec", "setkey", and "racoon"
programs to Linux.  The setkey program lets you set IPsec policy and
manually manipulate IPsec SAs; racoon is an Internet Key Exchange
(IKE) keying daemon for automatically negotiating IPsec SAs with
peers.
These tools have been updated from the version in Alexey's ip-utils
snapshot (which was using year-old KAME code).
You can find the source tarball at the Sourceforge project page:
        
http://ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net/
Testers are certainly encouraged.
Thanks,
-derek
