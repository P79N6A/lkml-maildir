packing locality is foo.

I don't.  NFS v4 guys should listen to Neil.

It is bad design to require it.  Currently we provide it, but it is bad design. 
It appears to be something fundamental that you cannot change access patterns,
and have a fixed id, and avoid adding a random I/O to a usage pattern that could
otherwise be optimized for by a clever repacker that could optimize that I/O
away by packing the object with other objects it is accessed with.  I was forced
to concede this many years ago by clever persons working for me.  I wanted
immutable objectids, they clean things up so nicely in the architecture. 
Mutable ids require what is effectively two way linking.  I lost the argument.
Thanks for being helpful to us despite a rocky start to our relationship.
I believe your other questions were answered in other emails, not all by me. 
Correct me if I err in this.
