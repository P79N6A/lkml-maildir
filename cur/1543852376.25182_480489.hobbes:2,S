I have enough docs to extend this approach to those chips if neccessary.
Anyone got an old 686 board to check.

Ok

I no, thats noted in the comments when I posted the diff. If it works
I'll cache ->driver_data instead.

pci_device_id objects are not refcounted and don't vanish underneath us.
Devices may but we aren't dealing in devices. The function operates
under the list lock internally so should be safe.
