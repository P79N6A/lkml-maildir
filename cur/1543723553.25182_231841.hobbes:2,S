Subject: [RFC] [PATCH] add TRAP_BAD_SYSCALL_EXITS config for i386
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/7/2/121

There seems to be code recently added to -bk and thereby -mm which supports
extra debug for preempt on system call exit.  Oddly there doesn't seem
to be configuration options to enable them.  Below is a possible patch
to allow enabling this on i386.  Sadly the most obvious menu to add this
to is the Kernel Hacking menu, but that is defined in architecture specific
configuration.  If this makes sense I could patch the other arches?
Comments?
