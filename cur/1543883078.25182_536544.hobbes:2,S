Yes, it is marginal.  But people do very often reach for BUG_ON() where
they could have at least partly recovered in some fashion - enough for the
info to hit the logs so we have a better chance of fixing it.
BUG_ON() is of course sometimes the right thing to do, but the idea here is
to suggest to the developers that they put a bit of thought into whether it
was really justified.
This little checking tool should have both "error" and "warning" levels -
AKA "fix this" and "think about this" levels.  BUG_ON would be a warning
thing.
