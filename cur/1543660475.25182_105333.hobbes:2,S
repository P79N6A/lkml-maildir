Subject: is it possible to bridge virtual devices (ie. a GRE tunnel)?

I want to set up two physically separate LANs with the same network 
address and logically bridge them using some kind of tunnel over an IP 
network.
I was hoping to somehow combine bridging with GRE tunnels in the kernel 
to accomplish this, but I haven't been able to find out for sure if the 
current kernel bridging code can handle a tunnel device as one of the 
bridge elements.
Can anyone give the definitive answer for this?
Thanks,
Chris
