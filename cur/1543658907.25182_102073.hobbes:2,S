I'm not familiar with "dolphin" cards.
I'm aware of "Quadrics" but I've not heard anyone try those with parisc-linux.
Quadrics cards do work on ia64 (for some definition of "work").

Or dynamically assigns windows to PCI Bus controllers as PCI devices
are brought on-line. For PCI Hotplug, the role of managing MMIO/IRQ
resources has moved to the OS since these services are needed
after the OS has taken control of the box.

You have it backwards. firmware only assigns resources to boot devices
and "console" devices. ie firmware does minimal configuration.
Why? An OS with hotplug support can do it anyway.
A "potential boot device" has firmware support which the primary boot
loader can use to load the OS or a secondary boot loader. But firmware
only needs to configure a single boot/console device that is
actually being used.

both ia64 and later parisc boxes from HP reserve GB's of LMMIO address space
for IO uses (LMMIO == MMIO < 4GB). AFAIK, physical memory behind that address
space gets remapped to higher "physical" addresses by the memory controller.
But making 256MB still fit in that space can still be a challenge.
One 256MB BAR isn't so bad. It's when the customer wants to have a central
server that has 2 or more such cards...64-bit BARs on 64-bit architecture
make life alot easier.
