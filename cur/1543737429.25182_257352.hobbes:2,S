Wow, that would quickly add up.  $100,000 for John Smith's 20 line 
patch,
$100,000 for Jane Hacker's 2 line patch, etc.  Ok, under said 
theoretical
conditions an infringer might owe a _lot_ of money:
	 $100,000 * 20 hackers * 200 copies sold = $400 million
Heh. At some point the court has to clamp the damages, but those kinds 
of
numbers would definitely get some attention from the legal staff of said
hypothetical company.
Cheers,
