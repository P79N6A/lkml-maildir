Keep in mind that at some point we may want to add exclusions - e.g.
"swapon() messing with block_size when accidentially called for mounted
fs" problem can be easily solved that way - that's probably the
simplest way to deal with it.  Ditto for RAID vs. filesystem - current
code for that is ugly and not too reliable.

Umm... Not doing unnecessary work?  Semantics of releasing a block device
depends on the kind of use.  BTW, I'm less than sure that fsync_dev() is
the right thing for file access now that you've got that in pagecache -
__block_fsync() seems to be more correct thing to do.
