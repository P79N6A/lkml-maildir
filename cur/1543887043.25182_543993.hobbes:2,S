Heh. I thought about another bit-in-pointer too. I can't explain this,
but I personally hate these bits even more than barriers.
I must admit, your suggestion is much more clean compared to what I
had in mind.

OK, but not very suitable, we need to copy-and-paste set_wq_data(),
because it is also used by queue_delayed_work(). Not a big problem.

We should not clear cwq. I guess you meant "does list_del() and clears
VALID bit".

We don't even need to check the pointers. VALID bit is always changed
under cwq->lock. So, if we see VALID under cwq->lock, we have a right
pointer.

I'd be happy to say I found many nasty unfixable holes in your idea,
but I can't see any :) Something like the patch below, I guess.
Ugh. OK, the barrier is evil. As I said, we can convert smp_wmb() to
smp_bm__before_spinlock() (which we don't currently have, but which we
imho need regardless to workqueue.c), but anyway it is not easy to
understand the code with barriers.
OTOH, the new VALID bit is _only_ needed to implement a special cancel_xxx
functions. And unlike wmb/smp_bm__before_spinlock it is not hidden in
insert_work(), but spreads over the queue/unqueue path. And. the
bit-in-pointer is always a hack, imho. And. It is a bit difficult to
understand why do we need a VALID bit when we have !list_empty(), so
_perhaps_ a barrier is not much worse.
I am looking at the patch below, and I can't undestand whether this is
good change or not. I am biased, of course. Tejun, if you say "I strongly
believe this is better", I'll send the patch.
Anybody else has an opinion?
Oleg.
