The debugfs will be available in distributions. And it's no different from
having SOCK_PACKET enabled before tcpdump can work. There's no practical
disadvantage, unless we consider a backport of usbmon into a legacy distribution
such as RHEL 4 or SuSE 9.1.
Since usbmon rides raw file_operations, it can use a chardev interface with
a minimal change. The advantage of debugfs is only not needing to allocate
a major and dealing with minor partitioning. I also thought it would help
to shut up the namespace pollution whiners (the debate of /dbg versus
/sys/kernel/debug was rather mild by comparison).
It should make little difference for the tool anyway, the base path ought to
be configurable. The biggest difference would be to scripts which launch the
tool: in one case they need to mount debugfs if not mounted (if initscripts
haven't), in other case they mknod if necessary (if hal hasn't done it).
It is too early to care about this anyway.
