So are you saying that you do a control msg read/INput
to modify device registers?  Or could it be that
you did a control msg write/OUTput to modify registers
and then did a control msg read/INput to read those
registers, and we are not seeing the entire log here?

So is the vendor-specific [control msg] a write/Output
or a read/Input?

You certainly couldn't do a usb_bulk_msg() from interrupt
context since it calls schedule_timeout().  However,
I don't know of any reason that you can't call
usb_request_bulk() from interrupt context.
I haven't written a network driver for Linux (I have for
NetWare, DOS, and some Windows).  In all of those, I
agree with you.  start_xmit() would be in process
context, not interrupt context.
