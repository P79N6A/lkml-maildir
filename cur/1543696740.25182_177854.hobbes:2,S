It's not a bad idea, but surely you should be using the init= boot
parameter instead of hard-coding a path.
In any case, I don't think you should expect a patch to be accepted. 
There's not much point in further crufting up do_mounts.c in generic
kernels during 2.6, until do_mounts moves completely out of the kernel. 
Some people are happy enough with root=0:0, so there's not obviously a
consensus about which stopgap measure will do for now.
