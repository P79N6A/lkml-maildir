Let me rephrase what Linus said, to help remove the misreading that
seems so common today.  I think a fair rewording would be, "A spec is a
guideline.  When it fails to match reality, continuing to follow it is a
tremendous mistake."
Additionally, I think the overall LKML feeling on hardware specs and the
corresponding software abstractions to deal with it can be summarized
something like this:
When the spec provides a software design that doesn't fit into the
overall structure of the Linux kernel, the spec should be treated as a
suggestion for a software design.  The *interface* that the spec
documents should be followed, where it moves out of the overall
structure, but internally, a design that fits into the Linux kernel is
more important than following a spec that doesn't fit.
