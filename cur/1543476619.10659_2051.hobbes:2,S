Hi,

We used to do it anyway, before inodes were locked for write, if I
remember correctly.  
What I'm after is something like the patch below for a fix (don't apply
it: it should work and should fix the problem, but it's really just for
illustration).  It enforces an i_atomic_allocate semaphore to lock
against truncate().  The write-page filemap code takes this semaphore,
but does _not_ take i_sem at all.  
Frankly, I really don't think we want to serialise writes so
aggressively in the first place.  In POSIX, O_APPEND is the only case
where we need to do this (and since that modifies i_size, it's a natural
case to do under the i_atomic_allocate semaphore in any case).
This patch should fix the problem in hand, but what I think we really
want is a read/write semaphore for i_atomic_allocate: we want normal
read and write IO to a file to guard against a concurrent truncate(),
but _not_ against each other (in situations such as threaded/async IO to
a database file, multiple outstanding IOs can be a big win).  Basically,
most writes should take out a read lock on the filesize so that the file
won't disappear from under their feet; only extending or truncating the
file should take out an i_atomic_allocate write lock (assuming the same
sorts of semantics for r/w semaphores as we already have for r/w
spinlocks).
Are there really any filesystems we know can't deal with
concurrent/reentrant writes to an inode?  We already have to deal with
concurrent reads with a single write in progress, after all.
