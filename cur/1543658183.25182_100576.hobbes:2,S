As I use the nvdriver on 2.4, I didn't have the pressure yet to chase a
driver for 2.5. But I'd guess that nvidia has some sort of non-public
beta program where they do testing of their stuff on latest kernels. I'd
simply ask whether there is such a program and how to join. 
After all, they surely _want_ their driver to be used. Because it sells
boards. :-)

Couldn't agree more.
