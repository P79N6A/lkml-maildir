Yes and you keep missing the point focusing on stuff that is not relevant.
Where did you get the rule that libraries should not be setting flags? 
libraries do all sort of conversion before calling the kernel API.
Look the libraries are a strong argument against the method of setting 
task flags. If you are using multiple libraries some of which have been 
updated and some of those which have not then setting a task flag can 
have bad consequences. You want clean syscall behavior.
