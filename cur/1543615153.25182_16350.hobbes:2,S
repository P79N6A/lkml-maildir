The manual says:
----------8<----------
Alternate Gate A20 Control Register (Port 00EEh) A special 8-bit
read/write control register provides a fast and reliable way to control
the CPU A20 signal.  A dummy read of this register returns a value of FFh
and forces the CPU A20 to propagate to the core logic, while a dummy write
to this register will cause the CPU A20 signal to be forced Low as long as
no other A20 gate control sources are forcing the CPU A20 signal to
propagate.
---------->8----------
But neither this nor the register description ("Alternate GateA20 Control
This register can be used to cause the same type of masking of the CPU A20
signal that was historically performed by an external SCP (System Control
Processor) in a PC/AT Compatible system, but much faster.") says something
about _how_ fast it is done.

Sounds good, I'll integrate it.

Hmm, there is no special section for chipset issues, the only ones I could
find are "Toshiba Laptop support" and "Dell Laptop Support" (also in
"Processor type and features"). Other chipset bugfix options are in the
IDE driver section, but this doesn't apply here. So the options would be
- add something like "Elan Support" in "Processor type and features"
- add a new section for general chipset fixes
What do you think?

ACK, I'll have a look at it tomorow.
