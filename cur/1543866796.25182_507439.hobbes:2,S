Those which are identified as OK should be flagged OK. Only those for
which we have no idea should be flagged broken. It's better than leaving
them in the wild waiting for a victim. And given what Nigel would like,
they would all have to be reviewed to get .suspend/.resume entries
anyway. But at least, we would only have to change the known good instead
of all of them. And the remaining ones would not cause trouble to users.
