PCI interrupt line routing is used for all V-Bus devices. Thats all
devices in any way on an internal bus of the north or south bridge. The
quirk is harmless when applied to other devices.

The interrupt line field is used to indicate the ISA type IRQ or the
APIC pin used for the IRQ delivery. See the data sheet.
The & 0x0F is the old hack used to get the ISA type IRQ line in use from
the IRQ number.
