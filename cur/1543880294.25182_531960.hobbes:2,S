Its cheaper to allocate a uart_info that keep doing all the checks, at
least for port->info. I can see why you want to avoid port->info->tty as
a debugger can end up running before the tty layer and that would be hard
to work around.
For the other macros - the macros are more efficient than the equivalent
inline code generation at least for some gccs.
Do you really need any of this change but to check info->tty ?
