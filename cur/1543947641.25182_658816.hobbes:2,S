The latest maintenance release GIT 1.5.4.3 is available at the
usual places:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/
  git-1.5.4.3.tar.{gz,bz2}			(tarball)
  git-htmldocs-1.5.4.3.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  git-manpages-1.5.4.3.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.5.4.3-1.$arch.rpm	(RPM)
Largest user visible change in this is RPM packaging updates by
Kristian Høgsberg.  'git-core' will only be pure git without
pulling foreign SCM packages in as its dependencies anymore when
you do "yum install git-core".

GIT v1.5.4.3 Release Notes
==========================
Fixes since v1.5.4.2
--------------------
 * RPM spec used to pull in everything with 'git'.  This has been
   changed so that 'git' package contains just the core parts,
   and we now supply 'git-all' metapackage to slurp in everything.
   This should match end user's expectation better.
 * When some refs failed to update, git-push reported "failure"
   which was unclear if some other refs were updated or all of
   them failed atomically (the answer is the former).  Reworded
   the message to clarify this.
 * "git clone" from a repository whose HEAD was misconfigured
   did not set up the remote properly.  Now it tries to do
   better.
 * Updated git-push documentation to clarify what "matching"
   means, in order to reduce user confusion.
 * Updated git-add documentation to clarify "add -u" operates in
   the current subdirectory you are in, just like other commands.
 * git-gui updates to work on OSX and Windows better.
