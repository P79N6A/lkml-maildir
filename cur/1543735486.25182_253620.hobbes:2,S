This is intersting...
I'd like to know how you plan to use VCs?  That is more then one tty
sharing the same monitor.  I'd also like to see VCs able to change modes
while not being active, thought I can't imagin how one would plan todo
this  /wo blocking.  I don't see any good reason why it can't be an ioctl,
you can have the same exe/bin/app handle BOTH the user and root parts of
the mode change.  This way it can keep a cache of things, like modes that
will currently not be valid.

There is another thing I can't see.  Why can't the module for the drm
create fb[0-9]* devices, one for each monitor?  This would seam to solve
the problem with having another app and ioctl(API).
