Right, ataraid uses the status ("uptodate") of the last component of 
an IO to inform the real buffer_head IO status, and that is quite bad.
The correct thing seems to pass IO error ("!uptodate") to the upper 
->b_end_io callback only in case both components of an IO operation have 
failed. As long as at least one of the mirrors have successfully 
finished the IO, we should continue operation, providing reliability,
AFAICS. 
About error reporting, indeed the current scheme is very bad and doesnt
correctly report errors. We should at least print some warning on 
ataraid_end_request() informing of IO errors. 
ataraid seems to have been designed with poor IO error handling from 
the beginning.
Arjan, could you please comment on this?

Its not OK to mess with BH_PrivateStart, no, jbd/xfs use it
for their own purposes.
Anyway, thanks for the bug report.
