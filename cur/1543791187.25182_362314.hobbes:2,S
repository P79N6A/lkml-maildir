Considering anybody can allocate memory and never release it, _any_ 100% 
solution is going to require migrating existing pages, regardless of 
allocation strategy.

You're asking intentionally leading questions, aren't you?  Without on-demand 
page migration a given area of physical memory would only ever be free by 
sheer coincidence.  Less fragmented page allocation doesn't address _where_ 
the free areas are, it just tries to make them contiguous.
A page migration strategy would have to do less work if there's less 
fragmention, and it also allows you to cluster the "difficult" cases (such as 
kernel structures that just ain't moving) so you can much more easily 
hot-unplug everything else.  It also makes larger order allocations easier to 
do so drivers needing that can load as modules after boot, and it also means 
hugetlb comes a lot closer to general purpose infrastructure rather than a 
funky boot-time reservation thing.  Plus page prezeroing approaches get to 
work on larger chunks, and so on.
But any strategy to demand that "this physical memory range must be freed up 
now" will by definition require moving pages...
