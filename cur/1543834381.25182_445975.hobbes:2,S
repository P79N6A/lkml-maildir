Tomasz,
yes, we have scripts/Lindent, but it cannot and is not supposed to solve 
all style issues. Coding style is about _much_ more than whitespace. It 
includes sensible names, usage of language features...
Furthermore, much of this thread revolved around style issues where a 
common coding style is not fully established in the first place.
