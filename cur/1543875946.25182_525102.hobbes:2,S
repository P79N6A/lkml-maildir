Ah. Perhaps my Kubuntu system was using a FreeBSD kernel under the hood back then.
It really did work for me, back about 2 years ago when last attempted.
But then suspend/resume (RAM) has always worked here on every notebook
I've ever used -- apparently not the norm for others.  I just expect more.
