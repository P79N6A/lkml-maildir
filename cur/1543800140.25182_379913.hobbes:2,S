x86_64 carried a copy of screen_info in miscsetup.h which was out of
date with the master copy in tty.h.  It couldn't include the full tty.h
because it is compiling in 32-bit mode (causes warnings from unrelated
junk in tty.h).  Splitting it out means that x86_64 can get the bare
minimum it needs to compile the boot loader while having the definition
in one place.
