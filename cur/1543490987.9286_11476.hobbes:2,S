Disabling a 16bit DMA channel has a chance of hanging the chipset solid.

This is ISA specific - it doesnt even seem to matter what PCI stuff is
going on. If you look in the PCI quirks you'll find "ISA DMA workaround"
listed. It only affects some boards but VIA don't believe in talking to
their users it seems so I've no idea if there is a workaround
