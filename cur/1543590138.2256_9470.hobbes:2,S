OK. I tried it on my A7V133 system and leaving out autotune (just for
Promise, where I connected the hard discs)  makes the system stable.  I
thought my problem is related to the Athlon compile problem I read in this
group, but now I am not sure.
Can you try and mail me if the Kernel 2.4.3 (without any ac patch) is stable
with your system even if you use autotune? "Downgrade" to this kernel works
fine for me.
