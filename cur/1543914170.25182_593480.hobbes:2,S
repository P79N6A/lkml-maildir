Initial test-drive looks good here, but I do see a regression.  First
the good news.
fairtest2 is perfect, more perfect than ever seen before in fact.  Mixed
interval sleepers/hog looks fine as well (can't say perfect due to
startup differences with the various proggies, but cpu% looks perfect).
Amarok song switch time under hefty kbuild load is fine as well.  I
haven't done heavy multimedia testing yet, but will give it a more
thorough workout later (errands).
The regression:  I see some GUI lurch, easily reproducible by running a
make -j5 and moving the mouse in a circle... perceptible (100ms or so)
lurches not present in rc5.
