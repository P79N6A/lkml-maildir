I'm not sure if this problem appeared in earlier test-versions,
or if it's just a problem with my current system somehow, but
I thought it would be best to report this warning I get at the
very end of the compiling-process. I'm no programmer or kernel-
developer, so there is no way for me to tell of what significance
this is.
Anyway, I get this message even after a 'make mrproper', so I'm
quite sure it's not a problem with old junk-files or something.
When I look in setup.S at line 165, I find nothing but a reference
to MAXMEM-1 or something like that, and it does seem odd that the
value gets truncated into an identical value (unless the value was
truncated before the message got printed, that is).

  LD      arch/i386/boot/setup
---------------------------------------
I'm running i386-systems with the test11-kernel. I got the same
message on two different computers, one AMD Athlon TBird, and one
Intel Celeron.
Is this a known problem, and is there a fix to this somehow?
