Well, my basic questions were
1)  Should we support DIO on files with sizes that are not multiple of
filesystem blocksize (but multiple of 512 bytes) == say 6K.
I think so, and we should kick it to use 512byte blocksize in the
DIO code.
2) Should we support DIO on files with sizes that are not multiple of
filesystem blocksize and also multiple of 512 bytes == say 8190 bytes.
I think NOT. 
The problem is, we check alignment restrictions for buffer, offset
and IO sizes. We don't care about the filesize - only issue comes
is if the user tries to go beyond EOF.
So on a 8190 byte file, with DIO if the user does
	lseek(fd, 4096, 0);
	read(fd, buf, 4096);
what should read() return ? read() is expected to return 4094 bytes or
EINVAL ?
Thanks,
Badari
