Jack, the audio server, misses a digital audio frame. I think xrun
means either an overrun or an underrun.
Basically Jack is running with extra priveledges expecting the system
to get out of its way when it needs to move audio data. It seems that
everything except my SAT drive is honoring this.
It all works great on my 32-bit machines. This is my first 64-bit. I'm
having troubles as are others. I think this is NForce4 specific.
Thanks,
Mark
