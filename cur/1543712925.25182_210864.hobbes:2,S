James,
Here is the next version of the ibmvscsi lldd.  I know you were waiting 
for the fix that correctly checks for errors on the dma_map_foo calls, 
which is included.  The other functional changes are to implement 
device_reset, and to surface a bunch of adapter attributes through 
shost_attrs.
This driver has been under test for the last couple of months, and is 
scheduled to ship in a couple of distributions shortly.  There are a few 
bug fixes included in this patch as well, mostly in the area of abort 
processing and correctly handling edge conditions (freeing buffers in 
error paths etc.)
Comments always welcomed.  I would like to get this upstream if I can, 
since the linux distributors are complaining slightly that it is not.
Thanks,
Dave B[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
