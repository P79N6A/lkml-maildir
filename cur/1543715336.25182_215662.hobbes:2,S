Unluckily no. xtime is not easy because the network stack uses this for
time stamps at several locations. Living in the past and time stamps for
network packets don't go together, do they?

Nod, the load could easily be done with an add_timer and we can live with a
small inaccuracy as far as the cpu limits are concerned.
By the way I am planning to do a BOFS at the OLS in july where I'd like
to discuss exactly this kind of questions. Any chance that you'd be there
too?
