every change (if it's not a bugfix, and even those) bear
a risk, what I like about the fastwalk patch is not the
performance gain on giant SMP boxes, because I do not have
any (unfortunately ;) but the code change from ...
        if (path_init(pathname,  LOOKUP_PARENT, &nd))
                error = path_walk(pathname, &nd);
to
        error = path_lookup(pathname,  LOOKUP_PARENT, &nd);
and
        dentry = cached_lookup(nd->dentry, &this, 0);
        if (!dentry) {
                dentry = real_lookup(nd->dentry, &this, 0);
                err = PTR_ERR(dentry);
                if (IS_ERR(dentry))
                         break;
        }
to
	err = do_lookup(nd, &this, &next, &pinned, 0);
which (at least for me) is more read-/understandable ...
anyway, thanks for you answer,
Herbert
