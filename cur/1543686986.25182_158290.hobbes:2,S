Both responding and not responding on all interfaces for ARPs
is RFC conformant.  This means both Linux and other systems
are within the rules.
Under Linux, by default, IP addresses are owned by the system
not by interfaces.  This increases the likelyhood of successful
communication on a subnet.
For scenerios where this doesn't work, we have ways to make the
kernel behave the way you want it to.
There is no discussion about changing the default, because that
might break things for some people.  So this discussion is pretty
useless.
