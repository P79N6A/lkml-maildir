dear sir
    The number of processes that are being created in
fork.c() in function do_fork are less than the  number
of processes are being terminated in exit.c in
function do_exit().
    I am placing a printk() in both the above
functions do_fork() and do_exit() and thus after
compiling and then restarting i am getting exit
messages of many process ids that have not yet been
formed.
    Another question is that while we are using an AND
operation to distinguish between a process and a
thread (
    if(p->flags & CLONE_VM)
 in fork.c in function do_fork() in linux kernel 2.6.8
).
    But if i use the above check in do_exit() , will
it be able to distinguish between a thread and a
process in the same manner as do_fork().
    If this is not the case , then plz tell where i am
wrong and rectify my mistake.
    One more problem is while p->active_mm is equal to
NULL in case of kernel threads and not NULL in case of
user level threads ; through this check we can
identify kernel and user level threads in fork.c but
in exit.c the same p->active_mm value is not NULL for
kernel and user level threads.
   Hence i want to know how can i make a distinction
between kernel and user threads . Is there any other
way?
 Eagerly waiting for a reply,
 Thanks in advance,
 Sounak
