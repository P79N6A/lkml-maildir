I'm going to weigh in here in favor of limiting effort on SMP development by
the core Linux team to systems with 4 processors and under. And not just
because I'd like to see those developers freed up to work on my M-Audio
Delta 66 :-). The economics of massively parallel MIMD machines just aren't
there. Sure, the military guys would *love* to have a petaflop engine, but
they're gonna build 'em anyway and quite probably not bother to contribute
their kernel source on this mailing list. *Commercial* applications for
supercomputers of this level are few and far between. I'm happy with my
GFlop-level UP Athlon Thunderbird. And if Moore's Law (or the AMD equivalent
:-) still holds, in 12 months I'll have something twice as fast (I've had it
for six months already :-).
