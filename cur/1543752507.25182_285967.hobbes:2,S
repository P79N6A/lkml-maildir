There are other good reasons, too.  One could be:
"Lets not make this security bug public on christmas eve,
  because many system administrators won't get around to
  applying patches, while the script kiddies have lots of
  time over their christmas holidays."
IMHO it will be good to coordinate things like this, based on
common sense, and trying to minimise the impact on users of
the software.  I do agree with Linus' "no politics" point,
though ;)
