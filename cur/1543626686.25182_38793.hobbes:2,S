   	* the client side socket passes in CLOSE-WAIT state
   	* the client issues a write on the socket which succeds.
 ...   
   Attached are sample codes for the "server" and the "client". Test
   was done on latest 2.4 and 2.5 kernels.
Your client does not do any write()'s after the shutdown call.
It simply exit(0)'s.
