Marking acpi_processor_power_init() as __cpuinit produced a complaint about
a section mismatch in acpi_processor_start().  Marking that __cpuinit fixed
things for me (patch at end of this e-mail, only compile tested on one ia64
config).

Perhaps it wasn't the comment that was baffling me, I was just generally
confused at this point.
