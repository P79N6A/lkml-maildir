Well, no, I verified it all by hand.  The tool I used for this particular 
job was "makedepend" from the GNU folks I believe.  I used a small 
throw-away perl script to drive executing it in every subdir of the tree 
containing .c files.  It's more of a one-time thing, really, I doubt it'd 
be too useful to keep around permanently, and anyway, I threw it away.  :-P
