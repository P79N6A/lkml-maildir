The notify from ftpadmin to lka-change didn't go out until
Tue, 28 Mar 2000 15:43:24 -0800 or about 70 minutes after
Alan's note (quoted above), or about six hours after Alan's
initial announcement....
I'm sure most of us rsync only once or twice a day from cron(8),
plus whenever lka-change mail arrives, hense the delay.
