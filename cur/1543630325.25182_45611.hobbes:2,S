I sent a first version of a Perl program to Linus, a copy of the program
is available at
http://mandree.home.pages.de/linux/kernel/lk-changelog.pl
(Yes I know the first $Log:$ entry is missing.)
It does the above, plus it has a built-in table to write a name along
with the e-mail address, so it writes something like this:
James Simmons <jsimmons@heisenberg.transvirtual.com>:
        A bunch of fixes.
        Pmac updates
        Some more small fixes.
Russell King <rmk@arm.linux.org.uk>:
        [PATCH] 2.5.13: vmalloc link failure
Of course, if BK ChangeLogs started with a 60 character summary line as
has been suggested, that'd be very useful. Something for the
BK-with-linux-kernel-HOWTO perhaps?
I can imagine letting the script look up the addresses by means of
Roland Rosenfeld's Little Brother's Data Base at a later time.
