For these types of bugs the difference is not in the IO performance
numbers but in the processing overhead. Does it make sense to track
processor statistics (sys/user/io-wait...) during the benchmarks. So we
could say that this patch doesn't change IO performance but uses 1% less
system time?
Maybe use /usr/bin/time -v sysbench ...
