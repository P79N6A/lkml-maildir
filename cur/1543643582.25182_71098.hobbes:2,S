This is easier and less error-prone than copying the oops down by hand?
I remember using 300 bps.  On a closed electrical circuit without acoustic 
couplers, you still got line noise.  Acoustic couplers put the speaker and 
microphone right on top of each other and surrounded them with a muffler to 
try to minimize ambient noise from the room...

Not everybody has a tape recorder, though.
And the -ac branch already does output in morse code.  Try taping that and 
writing a user mode interpreter for it, if you like...
