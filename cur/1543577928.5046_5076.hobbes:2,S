Well, that's why I put the "long" in quotes.  If the cached vma is the
10th in the list and we're looking for the 12th... we'll go through the
traversal loop twice instead of 12 times.  That's the point I was trying
to make.  But if we're looking for the 3rd... we'll just start at the
beginning and no harm was done.
