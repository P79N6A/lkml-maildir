I tried to get find what made 2.5.64-mm1 special that made my Radeon
card work, and had no luck in boiling down the differences more than
generally waving in the general direction "seems to be the PCI
updates". Nothing, up to and including 2.5.64-mm8, worked, but now
2.5.65-mm1 works like a charm and I'm on it now. I'll let you know if
it breaks again (or other breakage I find) :)
mvh,
A
