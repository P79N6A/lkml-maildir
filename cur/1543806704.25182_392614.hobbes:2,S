First, your code introduces many changes in many parts of the kernel,
so to merge it you'll have to ask many people for acceptance.
Second, swsusp is actively developed, not only by Pavel, and you know that,
so you could be nicer. ;-)
Still our approach is quite different to yours.  We are focused on keepeing
the code possibly simple and non-intrusive wrt the other parts of the kernel,
whereas you seem to concentrate on features (which is not wrong, IMO, it's
just a different point of view).  We're moving towards the implementation
of the features like the system image compression and encryption,
graphical progress meters etc. in the user space, which has some advantages,
and I think this approach is correct for a laptop/desktop system.
Its limitation , however, is that it requires a lot of memory for the system
memory snapshot which may be impractical for systems with limited RAM,
and that's where your solution may be required.
In conclusion, I see the room for both, as long as the do not conflict, so
could we please bury the hatched and start working _together_?
Greetings,
Rafael
