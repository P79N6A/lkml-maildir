Moreover, it isn't true even for the case when we create a list of files
in empty directory. Example: assuming that /tmp has 1Kb blocks,
mkdir /tmp/A
cd A
touch `perl -e 'print "a"x255'`
touch `perl -e 'print "b"x255'`
touch `perl -e 'print "c"x255'`
touch `perl -e 'print "d"x255'`
touch A
ls -U
will give you (lots of a) (lots of b) (lots of c) A (lots of d).
With 4Kb blocks you'll need 16 long names instead of 4 - the effect
will be the same.
The reason is quite simple - at some point you get no space for long
name and it goes into the next directory block, but there's still enough
for a short name, so it gets created in the first block.
IOW, there's no warranties at all.
