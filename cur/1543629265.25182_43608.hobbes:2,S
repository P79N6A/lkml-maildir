i do not know how glibc uses to export things but they should not export
any kernel related structure. the theory that went around in various
kernel update howto was to make linux, asm and scsi links to kernel
include dirs. even if glibc would export kernel dependent stuff ( ie
ioctl() params ) it should let the pointer go through w/out any
manipulation, otherwise it would be linked to a specific kernel version.

i've always used the symlink approach and if you're right i should
