	And I can do so on Alpha, which has forever had 64-bit file sizes
	also at the kernel side.
	All glibc since 2.1 have user-visible interfaces of 64-bit
	file-sizes, but the glibc/kernel interface depends on what
	kernel headers have been used when compiling glibc.
	Just for comparison, RedHat delivers glibc compiled with
	2.3.nn/2.4.0 headers -> newer interfaces are supported.
