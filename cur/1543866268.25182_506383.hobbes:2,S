build - yes, with dash being `$(shell)'. All scripts with `#!/bin/bash'
of course use bash, example is gen_initramfs_list.sh.
Trivial shell scripts, especially for embedded archs (Blackfin is
one, IIRC), may be easily converted.
BTW, Debian shell policy is to be bashizms-clear. Purpose -- to have
compatibility with any `sh'. Shall we?
