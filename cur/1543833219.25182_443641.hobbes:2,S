You are kidding, right?!?!
If you cannot operate the device using GPLed software!
What use is that software if after using all the GPLed available
drivers for the device it still does not work, and need a properiteary
modules in order to complete it? The derived work is taking something
that *WORKS* and making some modifications... In this case you don't
even have something that *WORKS*.
