If someone jumps into 2.0 maintenance, please let him stand up and say
so out loud.  I'd suggest including es137[01] audio driver in the kernel.
There is a patch floating around for 2.0.6, plus a small patch from
myself (backporting a few ioctls).
The reason I am running 2.0 (and wanting this driver) is that the only
usable version of RealAudio server/encoder only works on 2.0...
