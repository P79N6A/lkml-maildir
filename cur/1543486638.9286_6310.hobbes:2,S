I tried to access the main page for e2compr at debs.fuller.edu. It 
rejected me saying that the host could not be contacted.
I then tried to traceroute it and it sucesssfully traced something that 
appeared to have the same IP address. Are they gone?
Another thought I am having trouble with the hage lag between the 
patches that are being created for the kernels. As last I checked the 
newest patch is for 2.2.0pre5 (which I am currently using). Is there any 
way that this could be moved into the standard kernel.
I mean having hardware support for networking with smoke signals is all 
fine and good or support for some bizare hardware that 6 people use in 
the middle of the Pacific Ocean on an island is fine but what about 
efficiency and acutally being able to use such features?
Will the patch work on kernels that are newer and not break anything? If 
so I will try it out!
