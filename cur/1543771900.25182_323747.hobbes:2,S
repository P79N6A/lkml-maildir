Well, the thing is, you don't actually get a full list - you at best get a
_partial_ list of the merges I do. In fact, it's almost always a proper 
subset, with (wild wag) 10% of the merges never showing up.
If a repo has already merged with me on the far end, my merge will be just 
a "fast-forward to what they did", which won't show up as a separate 
commit.
Similarly, if somebody is on a different time-zone from me and just
happens to do his work while I'm sleeping, and I pull the tree first thing
in the morning, there won't be any overlapping development and again it's
just a fast-forward. So no merges at _all_ may be showing on either side
in that case.. 
This very much does happen, exactly because we have a "merge often"

Sure. It's just a shell script that generates the message:
	merge_name=$(echo "$1" | sed 's:\.git/*$::')
	if [ "$2" ]
	then
	   merge_name="'$2' branch from
	
	        $merge_name"
	   merge_head="refs/heads/$2"
	fi
but the reason I do it on multiple lines is that that looks better in the 
long format, I think.
But maybe the short format is the one I should prioritize, since that's
the one that also shows up in the summary line for the graphical tools
(webgit and gitk).
