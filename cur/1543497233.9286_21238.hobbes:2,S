There's no way for patch to be wrong. It replaces one approximation
with better one. If code does less work but faster, my counter will
show it as bigger cpu eater than it really is. Oh well. At least you
can see that that program is running!
PS: To put it other way
Old solution did sometimes say processes are running less.
My solution sometimes says processes are runninng more. [I think this
is more acceptable].
