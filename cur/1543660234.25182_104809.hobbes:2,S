I wouldn't necessarily assume a hardware problem (unless we also include 
chipset oddities). I get *exactly* one message stating exactly this per 
boot, and it always come a few seconds after loading the parport and 
parport_pc modules.
one example:
Jan 20 09:20:21 testing kernel: parport0: PC-style at 0x378 [PCSPP,EPP]
Jan 20 09:20:21 testing kernel: parport_pc: Via 686A parallel port: io=0x378
<snip>
Jan 20 09:20:07 testing kernel: spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
