Yes. CONFIG_PM=N in my .config.

Hmm. I don't want to do that for my real time testing. I turned that off
to eliminate a class of possible latencies.

How about the attached patch instead (which moves the #ifdef CONFIG_PM
and snd_ac97_suspend after the two functions I am having problems with).
Apparently the use of snd_ac97_restore_status and snd_ac97_restore_iec958
is in ac97_patch.c as well as in the power management code. I have not
run the code yet a quick build didn't find any problems with it. I have
a full build / test coming later today.

PS: On the other message you sent related to [add|del]_mtd_partitions
applies with the 2nd hunk failing (that code not present) but the first
hunk makes the build problem I had go away. Thanks.[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
