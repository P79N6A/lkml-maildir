I fail to see the distinction you're making between GPLv2 and GPLv3.
AFAICT, with GPLv3, there still is a simple guarantee that every
licensee has exactly the same rights.
Sure, GPLv3 follows the spirit of the GPLs more strictly than GPLv2
possibly could.  How is that "forcing ethics and morals" any more than
GPLv2 was?

I thought you had a copy of Linux and, per what you'd said before,
there was GPLv1 code in it.  I was just trying to make it easy for
you.

How about the "no further restrictions" bit?

Again, how are these arguments against GPLv3?  They apply equally to
any other license, including GPLv2.

You're talking about the legal terms.  The spirit of the license is a
very different matter.  It can guide the interpretation of the legal
terms, but the author is at a better position than anyone else to know
what he meant.

Well, then, lock down the software.  Make it irreplaceable, even by
yourself.  Problem solved.
