You seem to ask a lot of questions starting with 'Please tell me how',
and so far, all of these could have been answered by looking in the source 
or searching with google.
Might I suggest a slight increase in your amount of trying to find things 
out yourself before posting it to the list? There's archives of this list, 
there's google, there's dejanews, all of which you don't seem to use.
Good luck,
Jurriaan
