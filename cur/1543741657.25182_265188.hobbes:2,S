Bull. It's already been done, numerous times.

Your complaint is a mysterious thing and needs a degree in mind-reading
to understand what you're trying to claim and how it's changed from the
last post.
In other words, rephrase this in some remotely scientific manner so
it's unambiguous and comprehensible.

Backward compatibility remains a strict requirement as always, and
removals of features are still only allowed during major release cycles
e.g. between 2.4 and 2.6, after having given notice during 2.2.
