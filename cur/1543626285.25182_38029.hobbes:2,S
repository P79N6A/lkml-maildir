Thanks! Added.

Possibly. Describing all ioctl's is far too much work
for me to do alone, so my main aim was to provide a
good start and hope that others contribute more
until we have a complete set of docs.

I almost wrote "this is in the public domain",
maybe I should have, but ended taking the same copyright blurb
that all the other books also have. It may be convenient in
case someone ever wants to publish a printed version when
all fragments have the same copyright.
