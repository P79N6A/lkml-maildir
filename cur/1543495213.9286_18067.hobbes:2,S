I am having trouble with the loop-back device in the 2.2.7 kernel.  For
example:
Mounting a filesystem image with `mount -t ext2 -o loop=/dev/loop1 foo
bar` works fine -- the first time.  Unmounting it also works.  However
once I have executed the above mount/unmount commands, any successive
mount using /dev/loop1 fails with: "ioctl: LOOP_SET_FD: Device or resource
busy."
Also, after any mounts using loop-back devices have been unmounted, trying
to rmmod the loop device fails with a similar message.
I wasn't sure if this behavior was due to the kernel or umount (mount
2.9o) not freeing resources correctly.  Either way, at this point I have
to reboot to use /dev/loop1 a second time.
`lsof` does not seem to report anything odd (like /dev/loop1 being left
open).
Does anyone have any ideas?
