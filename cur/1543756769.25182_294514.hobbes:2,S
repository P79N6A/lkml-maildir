Subject: /proc/*/statm, exactly what does "shared" mean?

Hello,
I can't seem to find clear documentation about the 'share' column
from /proc/<pid>/statm.
Does this include pages that are shared with forked children marked as
copy-on-write?
Does this only reflect libraries that are dynamically loaded?  What
about shared memory segments/mmaps (ala shmat or mmmap)?
If there is a place where I might find documentation that is more clear
beyond the proc.txt in the kernel docs and then man pages for procfs,
I'd welcome a pointer.
Thanks,
