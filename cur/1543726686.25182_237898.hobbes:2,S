+110 usecs is too much to be explained by redirection and configurability
overhead. The configurability overhead is near zero.
could you try to repeat the '50 usecs' test with -L2 [that was the one you
used?] to make sure it's repeatable? The latencies of -L2 and -M5 should
be near identical. The configurability should at most cause a 1-2 usecs
overhead - definitely not two orders of magnitude higher. So if there's a
difference then i must have degraded one of the latency reduction changes
between L2 and M5.
