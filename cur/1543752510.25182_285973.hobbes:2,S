I was more thinking of atomic pte reads there. I had for some reason
thought that dup_mmap only had a down_read of the mmap_sem. But even if
it did only down_read, a further look showed this wouldn't have been a
problem for Christoph anyway. That dim light-bulb probably changes things
for my patches too; I may be able to do copy_page_range with fewer atomics.
I'm still not too sure that all places read the pte atomically where needed.
But presently this is not a really big concern because it only would
really slow down i386 PAE if anything.
