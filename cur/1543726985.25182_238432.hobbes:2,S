If the init scripts haven't run, then most likely your machine doesn't have an
IP address configured anyway. On some distros the network is configured before
the saved entropy is added to the pool, but most servers don't get started
until afterward.

I can't think of much else the machine could be adding at the point before init
is created. The TSC isn't going to be very unpredicable, since the machine just
booted, but it might have a few bits of entropy. Hardware serial numbers?
Fixed, and largely easy to get ahold of. I'm out of ideas.
Hmmm, it just occured to me that you could include process execution details
(owner, pathname, pid/ppid, timestamp) into the entropy pool, sort of like a
Cryptlib generator but in kernel space. But again, that isn't of much use
before the kernel creates init.
