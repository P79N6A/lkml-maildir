I found the culprit. Its not in sys.c core :)
remove_memory_block() takes a reference on kobject by calling
find_memory_block(). It then calls  unregister_memory() to free up sysfs
entry.
It drops only one ref (which it got at register time). So it never gets
freed up. I am going to send out a separate patch for it.
Thanks for your help.
