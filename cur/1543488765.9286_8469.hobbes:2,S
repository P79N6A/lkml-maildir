		^^^^^ this should be a restore_flags() according to me,
but looks like we need sti() to don't deadlock in the subtle
write_lock-way you Ingo discovered. I think we could remove the _cli
version of the wait_event macro, if somebody need some locking he can
call wait_event in a custom way as you did in wait_event_cli() itself.

Here I think we could add a third param to the macro, that will be the
retval in the interrupted case. It's zero cost and looks nicer to me.
