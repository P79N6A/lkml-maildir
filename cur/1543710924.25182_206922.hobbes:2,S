This is true for most devices (i2c eeprom, video decoder, ...), but not 
for all. All DVB cards have a device called "frontend" (basically a 
tuner with some additional stuff) connected via i2c.
Sometimes different frontends are used for the same revisons of one 
card, so we need the probe functionality at least for these kinds of 
devices.
