Apparently these guys made more progess than I thought.  Last time I talked
to them there seemed to be the general opinion that a driver would never
get done.
However, if you read the web page, it sounds like they're really not ready
to have this merged into the mainstream kernel.  I don't like to merge
things before their authors want them merged.
I don't really have any objection to the 2.4 patch, but the 2.5 patch needs
some serious cleanup before it gets applied.
