Subject: Problem after installing 2.6.0-test3

I just install the kernel 2.6.0-test3, but I can't make the modules. After I type "make modules", the error displayed as following: 
make[1]: `arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s' is up to date.
  CC [M]  drivers/block/paride/pd.o
drivers/block/paride/pd.c: In function `pd_init':
drivers/block/paride/pd.c:896: warning: passing arg 1 of `blk_init_queue' from incompatible pointer type
drivers/block/paride/pd.c:896: warning: passing arg 2 of `blk_init_queue' from incompatible pointer type
drivers/block/paride/pd.c:896: too many arguments to function `blk_init_queue'
make[2]: *** [drivers/block/paride/pd.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [drivers/block/paride] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
When I type "make modules_install", there is also error occurred
  INSTALL drivers/atm/ambassador.ko
cp: cannot stat ‘drivers/atm/ambassador.ko’: no such directory
make[1]: *** [drivers/atm/ambassador.ko] Error 1
make: *** [_modinst_] Error 2
And so, there is only two folder in the directory /lib/modules/2.6.0-test3 which are "build" and "kernel". I can't use the modprobe command, because the /lib/modules/2.6.0-test3/modules.dep does not exist. In the kernel folder there is only the drivers/atm existed and the atm folder is empty.
I feel very confused now. Would u please help me with it. Thanks very much.
