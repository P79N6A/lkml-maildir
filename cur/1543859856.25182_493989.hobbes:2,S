The file command uses heuristics to attempt to identify files. Here a
random sequence of bytes was simply misinterpreted as something
completely different. You can tell from the version string which is
totally broken. So, "file" could be improved to avoid this false
positive, but that's about it.
Now, what's still relevant is that my vmlinux.bin starts with a
binary sequence which differs from all other vmlinux.bin files around.
So it's a hint that it is corrupted, although a deeper analysis will be
required to figure out how and why.
