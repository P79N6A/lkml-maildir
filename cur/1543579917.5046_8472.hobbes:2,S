I have Marcelo's patch.  It isn't applicable because I am purposely not enabling any
swap.  The problem is the system gets down to about 7 megs of buffers free and within
three seconds has become functionally dead.  Zero response on any user input/output
device save the magic key.
The system will then grind the harddrive solid for about 25-30 minutes then
everything will go silent.
The brokenness is that the OOM code never activates.
