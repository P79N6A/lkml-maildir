I think it comes from the 64-bit accessing instructions (ldrd/strd)
having the restriction that they only take an even numbered 32-bit
register.  The immediately consecutive higher numbered 32-bit 
egister is used as the other half of the number.
Think about it as the x86 32-bit eax register being made up of
16-bit ah and al registers.  Only we call then r0, r1 etc not
eax, ah and al (and they're twice the size.)
