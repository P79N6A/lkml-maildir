Ok guys, forget about /bin/env vs. /usr/bin/env, I know that /bin is a
symlink to /usr/bin on Solaris and Irix (to get the path to e.g. 'env'
right IMO), but that was really not the point.  
The point is that 
#!/usr/bin/env perl
or
#!/bin/env perl
is an already existing solution to the where-to-find-the-interpreter 
portability problem.  And then there's the other version too which didn't
rely on /bin/env at all (and you can pass a parameter list to it).
