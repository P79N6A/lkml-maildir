Hopefully everybody who deploys these systems knows this. It seems
like a open death trap to me, especially since the consequences
are so severe: remote packet of death, could be a recall for 
a network conntected embedded device that doesn't easily allow firmware 
update. And they would rightfully blame Linux.
It would be much safer if the parts of the stack that weren't
audited/tested were marked this way and check for BROKEN_UNALIGNED or similar.
Also frankly I'm surprised that whoever designed these systems
didn't learn from the old M68000 who made this mistake the first time.
