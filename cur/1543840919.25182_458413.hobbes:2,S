Umm, yeah, good point.  This regparam behavior is different from the old
behavior, where regparam functions had to be declared as such.
However, this is a potential problem with all regparam users, who all
presumably use libc, so I'd imagine it works somehow.

I've been idly considering that, but it's no more than idle consideration
right now.
