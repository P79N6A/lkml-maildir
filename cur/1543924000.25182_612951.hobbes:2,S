Hi, a few points:
- can change it to use spinlocks instead? This would be most
  preferable.
- if not, you need comments.
- you also seem to be missing rmb()s now. I see a couple in the
  firewire directory, but nothing that seems to be ordering loads
  of these particular fields.
- use smp_*mb() if you are just ordering regular cacheable RAM
  accesses.
Also, diffstat is a bit wrong... maybe you posted the wrong version?
