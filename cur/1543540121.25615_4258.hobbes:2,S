Jeff,
Ncpfs became a standard user package, especially for office workstations.
IPX is a kernel future now. Ipchains (netfilter) included in kernel in
2.4.0. What's about including ncpfs package in kernel - maybe, in the
following kernel versions? This is unlogically: IPX protocol exists in
kernel,  a lot of disk partitions too, a lot of other futures too, but the
most usable tool for office workstations connected to Novell - is
not.
