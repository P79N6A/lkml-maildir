too late.. :(
rebooted and fscked.
on reboot, my console did hang up while unmounting fs's and i got tons of
strange errors about something on my fs(where the processes got stuck). can't
remeber the outputs, was too much and too fast.
only a sysrq-b helped.
on another fs i got some "Deleted inode ###### has zero dtime.  Fix<y>?".
(on other boxes i get them sometimes too if i manually check a ext3
fs)
shouldnt ext3 prevent those errors, since it has a journal and should
recover them???
on the fs where the processes got stuck i got some unattached inodes:
Unattached inode 1035466
Connect to /lost+found<y>? yes
Inode 1035466 ref count is 2, should be 1.  Fix<y>? yes
Unattached inode 1053163
Connect to /lost+found<y>? yes
Inode 1053163 ref count is 2, should be 1.  Fix<y>? yes
Inode 1053382 ref count is 1, should be 2.  Fix<y>? yes
Pass 5: Checking group summary information
is this the normal behaviour, to e2fsck the ext3 fs's after some time?
i thought that ext3 handles those errors itself.
well, after the reboot and fsck i can access my files again.
ps.: 2.6.0-t3 scheduler performance is not that good...
Regards,
Martin
