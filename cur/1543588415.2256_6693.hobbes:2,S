We have now tested 2.4.2 and 2.2.19.
2.2.19 has the same problem.
2.4.3 does not seem to be affected.  Unfortunately, we really need a
working 2.2 kernel at this time.
We also patched the 2.2.19 kernel with the PIII patch found in
/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.19pre13/PIII-10.bz2
on ftp.kernel.org.  Same problem.
Does anyone have any ideas for us?
Thanks.
Vic
