Reporting that stuff is trivial, but resolving the deep arch issues
with the remaining failures I'm getting (not directly bus-related,
actually I/O resource allocation going wrong) have me badly stumped.
Push back that ETA to weeks. I'll break off generically mergeable
bits and send them your way as I go though. The patch queue is
something like 20 long, but most of the content is "resolve one
problem after the other". Getting this into a state of "the system
works at every step of the way" is tricky, esp. since the end results
of today's excursion do not yet include a fully-working system.
