Greetings kernel folks,
Are I/O wait details available via /proc?  Will they ever be?
It seems like it would be almost trivial to count idle cycles
where the wait queue is > zero.  But it would be non-trivial
for me to code the patch!  =:)
Let me know if I'm missing something obvious here, but, IMHO,
lack of I/O wait details is a serious problem with performance
tuning of production Linux systems.
later
steve
