No.  You can't set "mount environment" in scp.
Otherwise your analogy is nice, but misses a few points.  The usage of
mounts that we are talking about is much more dynamic than usage of
environment variables.  You wouldn't want to set an environment
variable in all your shells just to access a remote system though
sshfs for example.  It _is_ possible (except the ftp, scp case) but
_very_ inconvenient.
I ask again, what solution would you suggest?
Thanks,
Miklos
