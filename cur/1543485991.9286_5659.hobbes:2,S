Well it might not exactly be a system call...but its an ioctl()...
It would generally go something like...
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <linux/vt.h>
int main(char *argv, int argc)
{
	int fd;
	open("/dev/tty", O_RDONLY);
	/* 3 is the VT you wish to switch to */
	ioctl(fd, VT_ACTIVATE, 3);
	close(fd);
}
