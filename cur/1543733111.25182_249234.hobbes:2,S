FYI I seem to remember issues on loopback due to its large MTU. Also the
printk_ratelimit stuff first appeared because the e1000 was spewing so
many higher order page allocation failures on some boxes.
But yes, the e1000 guys were going to look into multiple buffer mode so
they dont need a high order allocation.
