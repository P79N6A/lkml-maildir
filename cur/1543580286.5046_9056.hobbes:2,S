isnt the CPU utilization difference amazing? :-)
a couple of questions:
- is this UDP or TCP based? (UDP i guess)
- what wsize/rsize are you using? How do these requests look like on the
  network, ie. are they suffieciently MTU-sized?
- what happens if you run multiple instances of the testcode, does it
  saturate bandwidth (or CPU)?
