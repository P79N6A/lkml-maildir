tkparse gets annoyed over these lines in arch/i386/config.in in 2.0.37pre4
(objects to the define_int):
if [ "$CONFIG_MEM_ENT" = "y" ]; then
        define_int CONFIG_MAX_MEMSIZE 2048
fi
if [ "$CONFIG_MEM_STD" = "y" ]; then
        define_int CONFIG_MAX_MEMSIZE 1024
fi
I changed the lines to
	int ' Max physical memory in MB' CONFIG_MAX_MEMSIZE 2048
and
	int ' Max physical memory in MB' CONFIG_MAX_MEMSIZE 1024
respectively.
I also found that when I tried my standard trick of bootstrapping from the
.config file for 2.0.37pre3, I wound up with CONFIG_MAX_MEMSIZE undefined.
I know, I'm probably not supposed to do this, but it saves time and
(more important) eliminates transcription errors.
