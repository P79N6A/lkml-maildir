Subject: [PATCH] megaraid driver fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following (rather trivial) patch makes the megaraid driver work
under 2.1 kernels for me. All it does is to include <linux/version.h>,
to have LINUX_VERSION_CODE defined. With my kernel configuration, this
wasn't defined when compiling drivers/scsi/hosts.c, causing the
megaraid Scsi_Host_Template to be initialized wrongly, leading to a
jump into random memory during scsi initialization. I'd guess this
problem only shows up when the megaraid is the only compiled-in scsi
driver.
