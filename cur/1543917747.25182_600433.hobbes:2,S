A lot of command line options do that -- if not they would be usually
default or automatically used by the kernel.

Fair enough. I can add a warning in the Documentation.

It should not be needed with current systems as far as I know

No hack in this area as far as I know.

It definitely caused a lot of problems in the single socket multi core world;
but yes you probably worked around all of them that I'm aware of currently.
What I just objected to was that you complained that the current x86-64
time code -- which works much more conservatively and thus needs less workarounds --
doesn't have all of them. You basically tried to apply the special debugging strategies
for clockevents to the old code and then complained that they don't work.

Grand words for relatively simple changes. Anyways as far as I know
even for hypothetical future C2+ capable multi socket systems the current
x86-64 time code should work -- it should automatically select broadcasting.
The only thing it relies on that if there are no multi socket C1E systems
with broken APIC timers. Since that could be only future CPUs anyways
and I haven't seen any indication that of the upcomming CPUs will have
such broken C1.

Not sure what random hacks you refer to.
