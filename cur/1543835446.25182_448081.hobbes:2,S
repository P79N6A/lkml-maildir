No change to the behaviour here.. It does not hurt, but it does not help either.
I have not been able to get logs out of this machine yet while it's resuming. (no serial port and 
don't have another machine handy to test with netconsole)
Hard disk locks up for 30 secs and then resumes with a dropped interrupt message and I get a console 
back but all hard disk access result in timeouts. (I'm testing from a complete system initramfs)
As I said, with 2.6.18-rc2 and the libata patches from -mm1 it takes about 10 seconds to come back, 
but resumes reliably.
Brad
