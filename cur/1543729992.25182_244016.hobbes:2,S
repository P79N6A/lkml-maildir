HI
This doesn't exist in 2.6.7 and appears in 2.6.8.1.
I have debian sarge latest sync.
I do:
/etc/init.d/ntp restart
(but ntp is only stopped, not started, it's probably debian's fault)
(not when network is active I do)
/etc/init.d/ntp start
and check ntp status time several times with:
ntpq -c pe
I think (can't check) that machine freezes when the ntp has reached
status of being ready to change kernel's clock synthesizer, 
the kernel completely halts. No oops, no blinking leds just
whole machine stops responding.
I tried with and withot HPET, result is the same.
