As far as the kernel is concerned, asm/posix_types defines
__kernel_ino_t as "unsigned long" on most platforms (except a few which
define is as "unsigned int). We don't care what size type glibc itself
uses.

Inode numbers are provided for informational reasons only. There are no
POSIX or SUSv3 interfaces that take an inode number as an argument. The
only processing you can do with an inode number is to compare it for
equality to another inode number.
So I don't see how the file system would be able to do a better job of
truncation here. In principle you should *never* truncate inode numbers.
