that will hide the memleak again. Furthermore page_count cannot be < 0
unless we get a _double_ memleak.
The only chance for kpte_page to be freed, is to be == 1 in that place.
If kpte_page is == 1, it will be freed via list_add and the master page
will be regenerated giving it a chance to get performance back. If it's
0, it means we leaked memory as far as I can tell.
It's impossible a pte had a 0 page_count() and not to be in the freelist
already. There is no put_page at all in that whole path, there's only a
__put_page, so it's a memleak to get == 0 in there on any pte or pmd or
whatever else we cannot have put in the freelist already.
something else is still wrong, but knowing the above fixes it at least
tells us it's not a double leak.
