There was a similar thread to this recently. The issue is that if you
choose the wrong processor type, you may not even be able to complain.
This is a user issue. All the distributions of which I am aware boot happily
on any x86 machine, because they build the kernel for the lowest common
denominator. Some detect the CPU type and install an appropriate kernel
subsequently. So... the only way you can get into this mess is if you build
a kernel yourself and choose the wrong options. There are many ways of
producing a non-bootable kernel. The expectation is that if you want to go
off and build your own kernel, you need to know what you're doing :-)
