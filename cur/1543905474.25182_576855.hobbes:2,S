That's quite a lot of breakage for such a small sample of machines.  I do
suspect that if we were to merge this lot into mainline, all sorts of bad
stuff would happen.
otoh, as you point out, pretty much everthing which goes wrong is due to
incorrect or dubious driver behaviour, and there is value in weeding these
things out. 
But the problem with this process is that we're weeding things out at
runtime.  Some drivers don't get used by many people and users of some
architectures (esp embedded) tend to lag kernel.org by a long time.  So it
could be years before all the fallout from this change is finally wrapped
up.

We haven't found any such yet, have we?

Oh well, let's just keep maintaining it in -mm for now, gather more
information so that we can make a more informed decision later on.
