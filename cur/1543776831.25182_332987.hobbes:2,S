Well with the PREEMPT_RT patch applied the interrupt off sections are
reduced to a small number, ~100 irrespective of config options or
drivers (although I think APM might be the one exception) .
So with the patch applied it becomes trivial to test/inspect each of the
interrupt off sections , and thus give a hard guarantee for _all_
PREEMPT_RT kernels.
