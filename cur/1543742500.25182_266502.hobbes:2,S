It didn't change.
But there are three different possible reactions on my patches:
1. ACK, kill this dead code
2. ups, I really wanted to use this function
3. please keep, code using this function will/might follow in the future
Case 1 is the most common case (and this simply removes some dead code).
I had until now two times case 2 (which means the code is now better).
You are the first person for case 3.
