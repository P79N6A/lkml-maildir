See Robert Redelmeier's cpuburn:
http://users.ev1.net/~redelm/
It is coded is assembly specificly to heat the CPU as much as possible. See
the README for details, but it seems that floating point operations are
tougher than integers and MMX can be even harder (depending on CPU model, of
course). Not sure what kind of role SSE, SSE2, 3dNow! play these days.
Perhaps Alan knows?

That shouldn't really be that good a test. During compilation, CPU spends a
_lot_ of time waiting for the memory and even for the disk io. For maximum
heat, you really want a tight loop of instructions, that sits firmly in L1
cache.
The gcc compile is a good test for many other tests - it uses a lot of
memory with complex pointers references (tests memory, and bit errors in
pointers are likely to sig11 rather than produce subtle errors in output),
stresses chipset somewhat (memory throughput), and cpu somewhat. But to test
CPU overheating and nothing else, cpuburn should be a lot better. (Even
seti@home is better as it uses FPU). Just run them an observe the sensors
readings. Cpuburn gets several degrees higher.

Cpuburn exists when CPU miscalculates something (sign of overheat).
I'm not sure if cpuburn is included in cerberus these days (istr it is), but
a nice test set for memory, cpu, disk etc to run over night or over weekend
to catch most of the hw faults would definetely be nice.
