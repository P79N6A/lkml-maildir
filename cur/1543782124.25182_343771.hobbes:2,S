As it stands, etags doesn't find labels in the IA64 or i386 assembler source
code, because they're disguised inside a preprocessor macro.
I propose the attached fix, which adds a regular expression to enable
labels disguised by ENTRY() and GLOBAL_ENTRY() macros.
There's a similar problem for MIPS, which needs to match LEAF(entrypoint)
