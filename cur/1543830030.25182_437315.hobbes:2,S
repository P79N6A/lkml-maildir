The EFI code really should fill in the e820 memory map instead fo making 
up its own routines (and doing it badly at that).
There's nothing wrong with the e820 table, and we should consider it just 
the "firmware memory map", and not care how it's filled in (whether it's 
EFI or a real e820 BIOS call).
Quite frankly, right now I'm more likely to rip out the EFI code than 
start adding even more (broken) support for it.
On the Intel Macs, upgrading the firmware turns it into a perfectly usable 
machine.
