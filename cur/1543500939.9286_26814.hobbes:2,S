Binary drivers linked into the kernel *ARE* in violation of the
GPL.  Binary only *MODULES* which *DO NOT* contain *ANY* GPL
source code whatsoever are ok.

It is perfectly fine as far as I know for the BEOS people (or
iToaster people for that matter) to distribute whatever software
they like as a GPL'd product.  If it is indeed GPL, and does not
violate the GPL in any way whatsoever, then they can do just that
as long as they distribute the sources.
They can use entire chunks of the kernel, so long as any
derivative works that they make are ALL distributed under GPL.
They may *NOT* link *ANY* GPL'd code into their proprietary
closed-source code.  This is in violation of GPL.

We can find out the exact facts, and if in fact they are toying
with the free source community, we can give them some nice
slashdot articles.
