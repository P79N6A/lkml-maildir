I spent two hours on the phone Friday tracking this down, but I'm unable to
reproduce the problem myself.  It apparently only happens on (only some?)
PentiumII systems, not on my Pentium, P-Pro, K6 or 486 systems.  The
work-around, as you discovered, is using -DUSE_IO_OPS, which I've now made
the default.
I still don't understant why this would hang the machine, as there is no
unlimited for/while loop.
BTW, normally bug reports should be sent to the linux-realtek mailing list.
