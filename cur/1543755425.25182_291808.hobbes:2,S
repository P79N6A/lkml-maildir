Yes it does clarify the problem and motivates the reason behind using
shared subtree.
However going back to your original problem 1:
you have a daemon running in namespaceB, and a process running in
namespaceA and it acceses a auto-mountpoint /home. 
The expected behavior in this case should be: the autofs-daemon must
mount the corresponding device at that mount point '/home' on all 
existing namespaces(provided that part of the subtree is shared). Right?
So in this case it should mount the device in both the namespaces, i.e
namespaceA and namespaceB.  But you seem to be saying that you want to
block the auto-mount in namespaceA?
