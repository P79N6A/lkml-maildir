Actually, I guessed on my own, and this solves it:
append="hdc=ide-scsi hdd=ide-cd" in lilo.conf
In rc.modules:
/sbin/modprobe ide-scsi
/sbin/modprobe ide-cd
Gives this in dmesg:
SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
   Vendor: HP        Model: CD-Writer+ 9100   Rev: 1.0c
   Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
hdd: ATAPI 40X DVD-ROM drive, 256kB Cache, UDMA(33)
I don't actually know if the hdd=ide-cd does anything for the ide-cd
module, other than keep the ide-scsi module from grabbing it.  Does
anyone know?
Thanks,
Andy Johnson
