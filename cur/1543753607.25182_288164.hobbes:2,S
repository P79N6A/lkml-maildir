Given the general confusion and the difficulty of defining and
understanding the semantics of these predicates.  And given that the
foo_is_locked() predicates have a history of being used to implement
ghastly kludges, how about we simply nuke this statement:

and be done with the whole thing?
I mean, do we really want these things in the kernel anyway?  We've never
needed them before.
If we reeeealy need the debug check, just do
	BUG_ON(read_trylock(...))
