Thanks Evgeniy for your work! Even though, it's great what's inside, I'm
afraid it will be judged by the form of its presentation. A patch should
be something integral, testable on its own. I think it's not necessary
to package it that fine grained, as it becomes very hard to apply with a
regular mail reader (Saving/Exporting 50 mails is really a bit of a
work).
So, the form is a bit suboptimal. Don't hesitate to put all "acrypto*"
and "arch*" patches in one-large acrypto patch set, and an other for
"bd*". I'd be glad to say something different, but I think acrypto has
not been considered by the maintainers to be merged soon, so patch
splitting doesn't make sense anyway at the moment.
Best Regards,
