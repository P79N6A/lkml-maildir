Subject: apm suspend causes uninterruptible sleep in process

In kernel 2.6.3 (not sure about previous 2.6 kernels), after suspending
with apm the process which was accessing the sound device (artsd) is left
in the uninterruptible sleep state.
Suspend previously worked in 2.4.20 with the low-latency patch, the
preempt patch, and ALSA 0.9.6; the same problem occurs in 2.4.22 with ALSA
(both with and without the aforementioned patches).
gcc is 2.95.3
make is 3.79.1
binutils is 2.14 20030612
apm is 3.0.2
.config.gz is attached.

Just because it isn't nice doesn't make it any less a miracle.
