Hi Linus,
As Robin mentioned I believe Carsten was also looking for this interface
and I received an email from Bjorn Helgas after posting this stating
that he was also looking for it, so there may be several users for it.
I believe it was originally Christoph who suggested we took this
approach to avoid playing tricks on do_no_page. However, if you have a
suggestion for how to do it in a better way, I shall be happy to try
and implement it that way instead, if you'll share the details.
Cheers,
Jes
