Commit afcab879e4044f952b7a031d5fd504e0feb7df41 is the commit where Ingo 
both _reverts_ his patch you describe in the x86 tree and additionally 
moves pci-$(CONFIG_ACPI) in exactly the way that causes this breakage.
In the 4 hours between Ingo doing the += change and Ingo reverting his 
own patch in the x86 tree it was in a pull request to Linus, so the
"queued up" patch is in Linus' tree but reverted in the x86 tree.
I saw neither the patch changing the :='s to += on linux-kernel nor does 
"do not override the existing pci-y rule when adding visws or numaq 
rules." in the commit description give any indication what the actual 
problem was.
It's also not obvious why the revert with the subject "visws: build fix" 
also moved the pci-$(CONFIG_ACPI) causing this bug here.
