It looks better.
However, the fact that you need that dependency on CONFIG_MODULES _still_
shows that something is wrong. That dependency should not be there, and
the drm code should be fixed. Why does it care about CONFIG_MODULES at
all? It should not, and it _must_ not do that.
I have no idea what the get_module_symbol() code in question is trying to
do, but this should be _fixed_ and not just worked around. That's a bug.
