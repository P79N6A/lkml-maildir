These 2 barriers have nothing to do with each other.
Before this patch, smp_wmb() was needed to make sure kthread sees the
initialized &kthread_stop_info.done if it sees kthread_should_stop().
After the patch, this barrier() tells the compiler it must not move
"kthread = to_kthread(k)" down, under the "if (k->vfork_done)" check.
Because k->vfork_done is "volatile", it can be changed under us.
But, once we got the k->vfork_done != NULL we can use it safely, even
if the task exits in parallel. Because we have a reference to task_struct,
and thus to tsk->stack.
Oleg.
