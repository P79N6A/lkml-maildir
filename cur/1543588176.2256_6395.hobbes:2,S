Gosh, this seems like a bit of a red herring, IMHO.  Do you think the
LKML gets a "lot" of spam?  Or, how about the linux-usb-devel or
linux-hotplug-devel lists?  None of these lists are moderated and the
occasional spam gets sent to them, but I haven't noticed there being
enough spam to hinder the usefulness of these lists.
