atomic_value() vs. atomic_fetch() should be rather unambiguous. 
atomic_read_uncached() begs the question of precisely which cache we are 
avoiding, and could itself cause confusion.
So, if I were writing atomic.h from scratch, knowing what I know now, I think 
I'd use atomic_value() and atomic_fetch().  The problem is that there are a lot 
of existing users of atomic_read(), and we can't write a script to correctly 
guess their intent.  I'm not sure auditing all uses of atomic_read() is really 
worth the comparatively miniscule benefits.
We could play it safe and convert them all to atomic_fetch(), or we could 
acknowledge that changing the semantics 8 months ago was not at all disastrous, 
and make them all atomic_value(), allowing people to use atomic_fetch() where 
they really care.
