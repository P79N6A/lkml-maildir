We run 2.2.x kernels on several SMP boxes and uniprocessor boxes,
including 4-way SMP Xeon ones. After we chased all the buggy
hardware down (esp. RAM) they run fine. For example:
% uname -a
Linux beast 2.2.13 #6 SMP Sat Oct 23 11:29:25 CEST 1999 i686 unknown
% uptime
  6:18pm  up 28 days,  7:42,  3 users,  load average: 3.75, 3.73, 3.73
% cat /proc/cpuinfo | egrep '(processor|model name)'
processor       : 0
model name      : Pentium III (Katmai)
processor       : 1
model name      : Pentium III (Katmai)
processor       : 2
model name      : Pentium III (Katmai)
processor       : 3
model name      : Pentium III (Katmai)
