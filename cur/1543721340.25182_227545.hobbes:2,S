If a process segfaults is there currently a message sent from the auditing
code?

I have worries about both the complexity required from the client for just
monitoring the life time of a process/thread, and the overhead of doing
this with the auditing/netlink implementation, but do not have any proof.
We can take a crack at implementing a couple of hello world monitors for
process/thread creation and exec'ing, and come back with any limitations
in the existing auditing code that would make this particular type of 
monitoring painful.
