Gah, no.  Don't blame Paul.  It wasn't actually stealth either as it
got posted a few times to the powerpc list.
You can blame me and/or Grant if you'd like.  It's a Virtex specific
driver and I didn't see any problem with it going in through the
powerpc tree.  I'll/we'll do better next time.

Sure.  You could add my tree to -mm if you want.  Though I'd really
rather if we all sync up with Paul sooner so you don't have to track 5
or 6 "powerpc" trees.
