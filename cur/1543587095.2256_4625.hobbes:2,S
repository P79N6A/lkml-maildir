Give the man a prize!  
After failing to work with 2.4.0, 2.4.1, 2.4.3, and 2.4.3-ac3 I
enabled X86_UP_IOAPIC to stir up the interrupt code and it works.
I'll keep one of these servers set aside for testing and see if I can't
figure out a little more specifically what the problem is, but IOAPIC
is fine.  
Thanks for the help all!
