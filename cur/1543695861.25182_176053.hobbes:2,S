Hi Ben -
Tried it, no effect.  It did not seem to do a reset of the card; sync
never hiccupped.  I also set the mode to a different one and back; that
had no effect, either.  I'm using fbset 2.1 from the linux-fbdev site.
As for the YPAN problem, I have the screen set to 1280x1024 using the
sun 22x12 font.
