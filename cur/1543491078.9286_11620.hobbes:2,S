Hi Albert.
 > Check out /bin/false sometime. It is almost 100% bloat.
Enclosed are both /bin/false and /bin/true from the system I'm running
on (RedHat 5.0 with kernel 2.2.4 - not my system though), and neither
appears to be much in the way of bloat to me...
===8<=== /bin/false ===>8===
#!/bin/sh
exit 1
===8<=== CUT ===>8===
===8<=== /bin/true ===>8===
#!/bin/sh
exit 0
===8<=== CUT ===>8===
Where's the bloat?
Best wishes from Riley.
