Hi,
I have to implement a system which grabs udp packets off a gigabit connection, 
take some basic action based on what they contain, repack their data with a 
custom protocol header and send them through a gigabit ethernet interface on 
broadcast.
I know how to do this in userspace, but I need to know if doing everyting in 
the kernel would show a considerable speed improvement due to removing 
syscall and memory copy overhead. The system will be quite stressed, having 
to deal with around 15-20000 packets/second.
I didn't want to start this e-mail with an excuse, so I delayed it until here 
:). I appologise if this isn't the right place to ask, it seemed that way to 
me. I wasn't able to find sufficient and coherent information about this 
issue on the internet or on this mailing list's archives, so I decided to ask 
you people directly.
Thanks for your time,
Mihnea Balta
