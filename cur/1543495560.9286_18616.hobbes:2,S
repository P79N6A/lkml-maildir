You seem to have forgotten the fact that linux also supports the Alpha
platform. That's where I had the problem. The source was freshly untarred,
with all patches applied, and then a make oldconfig dep clean boot modules 
so that wasn't the problem either. The fact that asm-alpha/irq.h didn't
contain said disable_irq_nosync() was the problem, as pointed out to me by 
Ivan Kokshaysky. I of course made the mistake of not double checking the
i386 tree for it, but that's a different matter.
Thanks for your help,
