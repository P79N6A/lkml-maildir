Nod, this is pretty much my objection to hardcoding an artificial limit 
in the driver...

Agreed.  Really we have two types of information:
* the device's hard limit
* the default limit that should be applied to that class of devices
I would much rather do something like
	blk_queue_set_class(q, CLASS_DISK)
and have that default per-class policy
	switch (class) {
	case CLASS_DISK:
	q->max_sectors = min(q->max_sectors, CLASS_DISK_MAX_SECTORS);
	...
than hardcode the limit in the driver.  That's easy and quick.  That's a 
minimal solution that gives me what I want -- don't hardcode generic 
limits in the driver -- while IMO giving you what you want, a sane limit 
in an easy way.
Right now we are hardcoding the same per-class limits into each floppy 
driver, each disk driver, etc.  At the very least devices that act the 
same way should all be using the same tunable, whether it's a 
compile-time tunable (CLASS_xxx_MAX_SECTORS) or a runtime tunable.
Long term, the IO scheduler and the VM should really be figuring out the 
best request size, from zero to <hardware limit>.
