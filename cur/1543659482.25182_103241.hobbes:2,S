Subject: [2.5] new modules and initrd - when? Or perhaps how?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The modules support (up to 0.9.8) doesn't seem to include mkinitrd, nor 
does the stock mkinitrd (at least the Redhat version) seem to like new 
modules. And if an initrd filesystem is built by hand it doesn't seem to 
load, fails with a can't find module type message. Yes, I had the correct 
new static loader in the initrd file.
Is it intended that this will work at some time, or am I missing a 
mkinitrd program or the incantation to create the filesystem by hand?
