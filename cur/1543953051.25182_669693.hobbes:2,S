patch summary and patch description are _very_ sparse
[ at least two things are worth mentioning here:
  - tape->next_stage is always NULL so it is safe to remove
    all code depending on tape->next_stage != NULL
  - this patch removes the last place which sets
    IDETAPE_FLAG_PIPELINE_ACTIVE in tape->flags ]
