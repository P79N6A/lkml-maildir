Oops!  I overlooked the need to preserve the orig_eax value, though its
necessity is obvious.  This makes me wonder about those previous
reports that UML was working OK.
I refined the test case a little and that's in
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=241408
I've fixed this in the latest utrace patch set.  I also wired up
sysemu on x86_64.  This means 32-bit processes calling ptrace now
support it for full compatibility with native i386, which the vanilla
kernel does not.  It also means it works for 64-bit ptrace calls,
whether operating on a 64-bit or a 32-bit target process.
Thanks,
Roland
