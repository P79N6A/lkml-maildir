No it's not.  It's calculating them in a different way (the rdtsc-
based __delay()) than older kernels did;  this was necessary to
avoid problems with new / planned CPUs that have unexpected delay
loop behaviour (for example, Laptop CPUs that run at different
clock speeds when they are using AC rather than battery).

On all recent CPUs, BogoMIPS should be twice as high as the CPU
clock speed in MHz.
