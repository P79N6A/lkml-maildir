Thank you for the ACK Thomas.
Linus: Could you add this to your tree?  I believe it's still appropriate even at -rc3 since it doesn't make any code changes but simply fix an annoying warning.
Patch included (again) below for your convenience : 
Add description of 'raw' in comments for 
drivers/mtd/nand/nand_base.c::nand_write_page_syndrome() so 'make xmldocs' 
will not spew a warning at us.
