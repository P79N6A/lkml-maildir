I wouldn't say "not only in such case" but "mainly in such case"
(there's not infinite ram in the per-cpu caches).

I'm open to an alternate more optimized approch, however I've to say
that using the struct list_head and maintaining the very clean three
separated lists was really nice IMHO.
Also I believe there are more interesting parts to optimize on the
design side rather than making the slab.c implementation more complex
with the object of microoptimization for microbenchmarks (as you told me
you couldn't measure any decrease in performance in real life in a
sendfile benchmark, infact the first run with the patch was a little
faster and the second a little slower).
