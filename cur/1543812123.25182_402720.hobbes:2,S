About a quarter of the time when non-netdev maintainers add IDs, through 
the magic of merges, we've wound up with duplicate IDs in the driver. 
I've snipped several duplicate IDs from tulip and other net drivers over 
the years.
Further, in the past Brodo has _already_ been asked to CC relevant 
maintainers and lists -- or at least LKML -- with his patches.  He has 
established a pattern of lacking time to add CC's to his emails; it 
wasn't just this incident.
Where is the peer review?
