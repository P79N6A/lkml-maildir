Well, who said this has anything to do with IDE?

I couldn't figure out if there is a way to get individual changesets for
a date range from bk, each as a separate diff file, so I just went
through the whole big diff between 2.6.6-bk1 and 2.6.6-bk2. Since this
didn't smell like a device driver problem, I was left with only three
changed files.
This is the change that breaks things for me:

I'm now running 2.6.7 vanilla with the lirc patch and don't seem to have
any problems.
The comment in the change "forget active IRQ that is not in possible list"
and then the "irq 10: nobody cared!" messages from the kernel might have
something to do with each other.
This change is apparently this one from the log:
ChangeSet@1.1608.8.1, 2004-05-10 16:48:38-04:00, len.brown@intel.com
  [ACPI] handle _CRS outside _PRS -- even when non-zero
  avoid sharing IRQ12
  
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2665
Apparently Len Brown came up with this as a bugfix for a different
problem, but it breaks things for me. I copied him with this.
