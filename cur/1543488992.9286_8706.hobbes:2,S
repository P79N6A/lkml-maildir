You mean mmap? The problem is that most mmaps expects offset to be blocksize
aligned. In case of a.out offset is 1024 and if blocksize is != 1024 you
may forget running a.out binaries. We can either change a.out header size to
4096 (or 8192) bytes and order everyone to convert binaries, or do a generic
mmap(NULL 0, ..., 0); read_exec(); and expect strange things to happen.
BTW, I just tried to "convert" a sample a.out binary and chage the code,
it didn't work. The test binary was old doom game and it hanged
after a few seconds. :(
