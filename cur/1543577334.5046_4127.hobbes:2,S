(Actually it depends; I think FIFO/DMA paths are fine, but yes, the
software implementation can lose data.)

Have I missed a patch?  How do you know whether or not the printer is
on yet?
As I understand it, you can't guarantee anything about any of the
signals when the printer is off, so all you can do is look for
'suspicous' things (like 'no error' and 'paper out').  But some
printers do this during normal operation, and hence the LP_CAREFUL
switch.
Return -EIO when the printer is on and off-line is a bug, sure enough.
That's what the -EAGAIN patch was for, and Peter's patch fixes this
too.
But if you want to avoid losing data when your printer is off you need
to use LP_CAREFUL, and hope printing still works at all (depends on
your printer).
If this goes away:
        if ((status & LP_PERRORP) && !(LP_F(minor) & LP_CAREFUL))
                /* No error. */
                last = 0;
then some people might not be able to print at all.
Tim.
