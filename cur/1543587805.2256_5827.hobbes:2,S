The problem with this is that there is no single init. Most
distribution run the same SysV init, but there are quite a few init
replacements around. Should we really break all of them? We can simply
use another signal and build a generic (and extensible) signalling
mechanism around it, so I don't really see a reason why we should
break old inits.
