It seems that a certain timing is necessary: one flood ping or a single
ncp usually doesn't trigger any problems, but 2 concurrent flood pings
hang the network after 5-10 seconds. It's not multi processor specific,
both I and Frank can trigger it when we boot with one cpu.
So far it seems that only the io apic for the BX chipset is affected
(only SMP BX boards contain an io apic).
Any volunteers with ne2k-pci cards and other motherboards that include
an io apic (e.g. all Intel motherboards that use an IO Controller Hub,
Via Apollo Pro133, Pro133A, KX133)?
Please:
* apply the attached patch.
* compile the kernel for SMP, or at least enable uniprocessor io apic
support.
* reboot.
* flood ping the computer with 2 concurrent flood pings from a second
computer.
* wait one minute.
According to the ICH2 documentation the IRR bit on the IO APIC is
writable - that's either a docu error, or could cause further problems.
