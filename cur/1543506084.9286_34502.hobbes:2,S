Yes. It's by library. It's called "Linuxthreads". If is unknown if WinNT
has threads in the kernel, because the kernel source isn't published.
Micro$oft can claim anything they wish. Further, if threads "in the
kernel" is considered a requirement by the so-called "Director", you
probably don't want to work for that "Director" because he/she has
proven opinion without demonstrated competence.
