I much prefer a compile-time thing.
Performance is, to me, paramount for "checker". I don't want to slow it 
down, I'm hoping that some day we can just enable C=1 by default in the 
kernel build (this is a _long_ time off, though, don't you all start 
worrying now).
I don't see anything wrong with a compile/install time thing, that is, 
after all, how gcc too works.
