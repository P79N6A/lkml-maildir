Yes, that I learnt by looking at mounts_open(), the problem is how
do I get the statctr_pentry (or statctr_group if you like) in
the open method ? It seems to me that in order to do this, we
need the following -
1. An exported wrapper create_statctr_entry() around 
   create_seq_entry() code that sticks the statctr_group pointer into
   proc_entry->data.
2. Some way to get the proc entry from the inode in statctr_open()
   and stick it to seq_file->private for seq_file methods to use.
Is this understanding correct or is there a better and simpler
way to do this ?
Thanks
