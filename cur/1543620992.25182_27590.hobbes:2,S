Here is the output of /proc/mtrr with the 4gb image
reg00: base=0xe0000000 (3584MB), size= 512MB: uncachable, count=1
reg01: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=4096MB: write-back, count=1
And this is with 64gb image
reg00: base=0xe6000000 (3680MB), size=  32MB: uncachable, count=1
reg01: base=0xe8000000 (3712MB), size= 128MB: uncachable, count=1
reg02: base=0xf0000000 (3840MB), size= 256MB: uncachable, count=1
reg03: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=8192MB: write-back, count=1
reg04: base=0x200000000 (8192MB), size=4096MB: write-back, count=1
reg05: base=0x300000000 (12288MB), size=2048MB: write-back, count=1
reg06: base=0x380000000 (14336MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
reg07: base=0x3c0000000 (15360MB), size= 512MB: write-back, count=1
I'm not sure if that looks right, any ideas?
Thanks
