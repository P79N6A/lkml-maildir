Here's another vote against SPF.
FWIW, DomainKeys looks nice.

Though this may not be your thing, I've often thought that this sort of 
task would be an -excellent- janitor task.
Create two simple web pages, one that shows the last 24 hours' worth of 
LKML posts, and another one that shows the last 24 hours' worth of spam. 
  Allow any user on the Internet to report an LKML post as spam, or 
alternately, highlight a false positive as not-spam.  (perhaps generate 
one of those wavy-text verify-you-are-a-human graphics)
Then you, as admin, only have to click a button that accepts or rejects 
the submission(s).  If you want to scan it yourself for false positives, 
you just hit the same webpage as everybody else.
That feedback is then fed into the bayesian system, to train it using 
well-known methods.
