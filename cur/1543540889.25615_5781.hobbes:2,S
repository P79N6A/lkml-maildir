Actually test6-pre* seems to, at least for files and processes.
See linux/kernel/user.c
I guess it would be trivial to use it for mlock too. Of course you still
want a global limit too. Having a few pages mlockable per user per defalt
would be very useful for cryptographic software that does not want its
keys stored on the swap partition.
