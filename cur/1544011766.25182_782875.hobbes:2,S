Subject: [PATCH 26/26] kbuild: support switching source directories with O=.. builds
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/20/68

It was not possible to use the same output directory
for two different source repositories becuase the asm
symlink in include2/asm would point to the first repository.
We now create the symlink each time thus allowing switch
between different source repositories.
This feature was requested by Andi Kleen.
