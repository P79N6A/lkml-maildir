    Well, I could suspend/resume correctly first time I tried (runlevel 2 and
    disabling nearly everything to minimize loss of data on crash).
    The second test in X resulted in a 'double fault'...
What happens if you turn off X and/or run X in some kind of framebuffer
mode (probably VESA mode)?  That's the only way it will work for me.
The native mode X drivers like to hack the hardware (look at all the PCI
analysis in XFree86.0.log if you want to see what i'm talking about).
If X sets up the hardware in a special way, then if LINUX gets suspend
and resumed (re-booted, from the standpoint of the display hardware),
then any state that X set up for itself will be hopelessly lost.
So i'm not sure X in DRI mode can work at all, at least, not the version
that i'm running (4.2.1-11).
