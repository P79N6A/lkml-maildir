As an alternative to using VT IOCTLs you should be able to echo these
values to /sys/class/graphics/fb0/blank and blank the screen. The
attribute is pretty new so it hasn't had a lot of testing on the
various fbdev drivers.
#define VESA_NO_BLANKING        0
#define VESA_VSYNC_SUSPEND      1
#define VESA_HSYNC_SUSPEND      2
#define VESA_POWERDOWN          3
