This is just a heads up, because I'm still trying to get the machine
back together after it crashed...
I have an RH5.2 machine with the 2.2.0 updates and 2.2.2ac5.  It has
an AHA2940UW with one internal narrow disk (the boot disk) and two
internal wide disks as the primary SCSI controller.  There's also a
second AHA2940AU with four external SCSI disks.  The first controller
has the BIOS enabled (so I can boot off it, obviously), the second
doesn't.
I've upped the default number of SCBs to 24 and set aic7xxx=ultra in
/etc/lilo.conf.
The machine works quite happily when disks are mounted from the first
controller, but as soon as I attempt to mount a disk on the second
controller I get these errors :
kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 55961, scsi1, channel 0, id 4, lun 0 Write (6) 00 00 41 02 00
kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 55962, scsi1, channel 0, id 4, lun 0 Read (6) 1c 40 87 02 00
kernel: SCSI host 1 abort (pid 55962) timed out - resetting
kernel: SCSI bus is being reset for host 1 channel 0.
kernel: (scsi1:-1:-1:-1) Referenced SCB 0 not valid during SELTO.
kernel:         SCSISEQ = 0x5a SEQADDR = 0x8 SSTAT0 = 0x10 SSTAT1 = 0x88
The last two lines repeat many times until the machine panics.
As soon as I can get the machine back on-line (it takes ages to fsck
all that disk) I'll try again with the 2.2.2 vanilla kernel.
James.
