More clues...
The only way I can seem to bring the machine back to being totally
normal after buff/cache fullness is to force some swap to be written,
such as by doing
lmdd opat=1 count=1 bs=900m
If I do
lmdd opat=1 count=1 bs=500m
about 500MB of memory is freed but no swap is written, and modify_ldt
still returns ENOMEM if I run xmms, display, etc....
It looks like the problem is somewhere in vmalloc since that's what
returns a null pointer where ENOMEM gets set in arch/i386/kernel/ldt.c
BTW I have been running kernels with
CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y
CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y
I am compiling a kernel with
CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM=y
and will see if the bad memory behavior continues.
