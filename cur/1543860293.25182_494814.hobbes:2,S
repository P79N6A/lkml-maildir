Yeah.  I believe that more exactly it happens if the very last
write to the page causes a writeback (due to dirty balancing)
while another writeback for the page is already happening.
As usual in these cases, I have zero proof.

It's the do_wp_page -> balance_dirty_pages -> generic_writepages
path for sure.  Maybe it's enough to change
                         if (wbc->sync_mode != WB_SYNC_NONE)
                                 wait_on_page_writeback(page);
                         if (PageWriteback(page) ||
                             !clear_page_dirty_for_io(page)) {
                                 unlock_page(page);
                                 continue;
                         }
to
                         if (wbc->sync_mode != WB_SYNC_NONE)
                                 wait_on_page_writeback(page);
                         if (PageWriteback(page)) {
                         	    redirty_page_for_writepage(wbc, page);
                                 unlock_page(page);
                                 continue;
                         }
                         if (!clear_page_dirty_for_io(page)) {
                                 unlock_page(page);
                                 continue;
                         }
or something along those lines.  Completely untested of course :-)
