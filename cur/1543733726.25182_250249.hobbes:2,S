As I suspected yesterday but didn't report because it seemed like not very
reasonable idea:
that problem was linked to the fact that nfs-mounted directory became
unavailable... I have a host (belka) which exports a couple of
directories and it is nfs-mounted using am-utils:
ravana[0] ~>mount | grep belka
belka:/home/yoh.m on /amd/belka/root/home/yoh.m type nfs (rw,proto=tcp)
last evening belka halted for some reason and that directory became
unavailable:
multiple error messages:
nfs_stat_to_errno: bad nfs status return value: 11
nfs_stat_to_errno: bad nfs status return value: 11
nfs_statfs: statfs error = 5
RPC: error 5 connecting to server belka
I've tried to unmount it but it didn't work...
This morning I saw that hanged fuser processes which I've tried to kill,
finally died, but new ones still didn't work correctly.
When I arrived at work and rebooted belka, ravana became fine again -
fuser/df/etc works fine.
Under Debian I'm running vanilla 2.6.8-rc3-bk3 kernel and
ii  nfs-common     1.0.6-3        NFS support files common to client and server
ii  nfs-kernel-ser 1.0.6-3        Kernel NFS server support
I think that problems with NFS have to not influence the work of the
system that much... May be I should switch to user space nfs server...
Any ideas on how to further debug this situation to avoid future
problems?
