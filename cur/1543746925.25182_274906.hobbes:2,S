HI,
For the project i'm doing, i must know how the Linux kernel allocate
sockets source port (from the dynamic range of the (2**16)-1 ports). I
looked on the Web but it's really hard to find the algoritm of the
source port allocation...
Someone maybe know how it's work or if there is a paper on the web that
explain this source port selection ?
Thanks a lot for your help !
