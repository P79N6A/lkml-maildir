Agreed, I was just using names here as a simplification.

If you are worried about this, don't reuse x:y.  Make them purely
dynamic, and incrementing :)  Yes, this is a 2.7 thing, but will happen
eventually.  I need this framework in order to be able to do that, so
one can't happen without the other...

I don't want to ever miss events.

I thought we were thinking about a 32:32 split.  But whatever, it
doesn't matter to me.

Then it gets swapped back in.  There isn't anything I can do from
userspace about this.  Hm, well I could pin the memory for the daemon,
but that wouldn't be nice :)
Ok, if you are worried about these kinds of things, then use the
in-kernel devfs.  I'm not going to dispute that userspace faults can
happen.

See above solution about not re-using numbers :)

True.  This is hard, let's go shopping...

Ok, and the scsi code takes a while to discover them all.  Try it with
scsi-debug, you can watch them get all created, one after another.  Yes,
we spawn a lot of userspace tasks.

I can guarantee nothing :)
But I can do a lot to prevent losses.  A lot of people around here point
to the old way PTX used to regenerate the device naming database on the
fly.  We could do that by periodically scanning sysfs to make sure we
are keeping /dev in sync with what the system has physically present.
That's one way, I'm sure there are others.
