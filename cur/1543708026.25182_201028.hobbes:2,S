Subject: distinguish two identical network cards

Hello!
Some clarification:
It is important, that the cards can be distinguished without any user driven
action - it must run automatically. The machines will be delivered to somebody
who doesn't know anything about linux / unix. I must be able to do a
configuration like that:
Physical upper card: eth0
Physical lower card: eth1
The customer will be told, e.g.: plug in the network cable from switch a to the
upper card, the cable to the switch b must be connected to the lower card.
Thank you for every hint,
kind regards,
Andreas Hartmann
