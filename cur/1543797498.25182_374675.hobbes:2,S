  Yes, file shows your gcc does indeed do the right thing with -m64, and 
thank you, but I was already familiar with -m64 (to say nothing of 
passing LDEMULATION to userspace compilations [info binutils, if you 
need to know]).
  So, do you have some sort of religious objection to using 
CROSS_COMPILE= when building for a processor that doesn't match the 
userspace ?  And I repeat, messing with CFLAGS should NOT be necessary.
