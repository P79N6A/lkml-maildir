In the client, I've added a read(fd, buf, 1) just after the write,
and rerun:
	client				server
	...				...
					shutdown()
	...		
lsof will shown the client socket being in CLOSE_WAIT at this point
					...
	write(fd, buf, 5) = 5
	read(fd, buf, 1) = 0
	...
	exit(0)
					exit(0)
As you can see, read() doesn't return any error, just 0 to 
indicate end-of-file (seems correct interpretation of remote
shutdown here), but it doesn't report any error from the 
precedent write... Bug ?

Perfectly valid but only if the 'applicative close' has reached the
other end. If it's still queued in TCP buffers, the client may not
have received yet that close... I thought that this was the only
reason that shutdown() existed at all: flush the buffers preparing
an imminent close...

Thanks for the pointer.
