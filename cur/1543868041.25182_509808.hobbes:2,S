Hi,
so finally I'm also looking at that driver,
http://pieleric.free.fr/o2scr/
the driver compiles fine, though it doesn't seem to work (unless I'm
doing something wrong here)
dmesg shows up following entries:
pccard: card ejected from slot 1
PCMCIA: socket c160c364: *** DANGER *** unable to remove socket power
pccard: PCMCIA card inserted into slot 1
pcmcia: registering new device pcmcia1.0
pccard: card ejected from slot 1
PCMCIA: socket c160c364: *** DANGER *** unable to remove socket power
pccard: PCMCIA card inserted into slot 1
pcmcia: registering new device pcmcia1.0
pccard: card ejected from slot 1

OZSCRLX O2Micro SmartCardBus Reader (for kernel >= 2.6.17)
The module for any reason has a usecount value of 1
ozscrlx                21548  1
devicenode /dev/ozscrlx isn't opened anywhere either.
I'll do some further investigations uppon it, I'd also like to see it
directly in the kernel. It would be handy to use for encrypted
filesystems.
