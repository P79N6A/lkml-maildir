Only in 2.4.12aa1: 00_backout-2.4.11pre1-1
Only in 2.4.12aa1: 00_o_direct-2
Only in 2.4.13pre2aa1: 00_o_direct-3
	Made a self contained patch that applies cleanly to 2.4.13pre2 ready
	for merging. Many thanks to Janet Morgan for fiding another bug in the
	blkdev O_DIRECT support.
Only in 2.4.12aa1: 00_cache-without-buffers-1
Only in 2.4.12aa1: 00_parport-fix-1
	Just in mainline.
Only in 2.4.13pre2aa1: 00_files_struct_rcu-2.4.10-04-1
	File locking read/write spinlock replaced with RCU.
Only in 2.4.13pre2aa1: 00_ordered-freeing-1
	Free the pages so that they gets allocated in physical order later,
	shouldn't matter but I got reports of slower in-core (cache)
	performance on some arch after a fresh boot, and speedup after the
	freelist got randomized by load.
Only in 2.4.13pre2aa1: 00_rcu-poll-1
	RCU implementation based on latest Dipankar's patch against 2.4.10.
	I changed it so that it only has as fast-path/reader-load cost a
	per-cpu counter increment in scheduler and nothing else. It is not
	arch dependent either. I also tried to optimized the UP case.
Only in 2.4.12aa1: 00_rwsem-fair-22
Only in 2.4.13pre2aa1: 00_rwsem-fair-23
	Rediffed.
Only in 2.4.12aa1: 00_rwsem-fair-22-recursive-4
Only in 2.4.13pre2aa1: 00_rwsem-fair-23-recursive-4
	Renamed.
Only in 2.4.12aa1: 00_vm-2
Only in 2.4.13pre2aa1: 00_vm-3
Only in 2.4.13pre2aa1: 00_vm-3.1
	Further vm changes, backed out the PG_wait_for_IO since it seems not
	to make a relevant difference. Should behave better under swap load.
	In particular I'm probing the inactive list from shrink_cache now,
	so that I get feedback on when it's time to swap before the shrinks
	on the inactive list starts failing.
Only in 2.4.12aa1: 10_compiler.h-1
Only in 2.4.13pre2aa1: 10_compiler.h-2
