Hi Dave.
Walking through my mailbox I found this one.
I did not get similar reports and I cannot reproduce it.
Do you continue to see this or had it been fixed somehow?
The only way I can see it heppen is that you have lost
the initial assignmnet in top-level Makefile so
make see this as an '=' assinment and not a ':='
assignment.
The first may not reference itself.
