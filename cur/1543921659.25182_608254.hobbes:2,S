Bummer, I only tested a cross-compile build, as I don't have access to a
native m68k machine at this moment. Third time, good time? I also added
m68k-unknown-linux-gnu- to please Kolbjørn Barmen and the other Gentoo

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
