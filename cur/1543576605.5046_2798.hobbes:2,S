Hello Dag,
I discovered that my notebook supported FIR, but I didn't know the chip (and it
was not documented). So I disassembled it completely and found an SMC FDC37N769
inside. It's now correctly detected with the following trivial patch against
kernel 2.2.18 (the same entry should be added to findchip).
Merry Christmas to you and all the folks on LKML,
Willy
