Already done. One more optimization is regarding use of memcpy() in
place of COPY4() macros and open byte-by-byte copying. There are some
places where it's very hard to get it correct without adding
additional checks on various values which casues futher overhead by
iteslf - even then I could not get them correct so I decided not to go
with this particular optimization by myself.

Already tested on x86, amd64, ppc (by Bret). I do not have machines
from other archs available. Bret tested 'take 3' version but no
changes were introduced in further revisions that could affect
correctness - but still it will be good to have this version tested
too. Only with inclusion in -mm and testing by much wider user base
can make it to mainline (I suppose nobody uses -mm for production use
anyway).

Replied in earlier mail regarding this.

This is what I am looking for :)
