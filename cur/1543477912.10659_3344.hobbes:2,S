The expectation is that the +10 niced program gets half the
CPU time from the 'normal' process.

I have a patch that does this. But since the patch can trigger
a known race condition (hardly ever happens, I've seen it once
in 4 months) and since I want people to test vanilla 2.2.0-pre*
as much as possible I haven't updated the patch since -132.
Once 2.2.0 stabilizes I'll continue to work on the patch,
in the meantime please ignore my patchlet and forget about
it :)

I'll work on this as soon as 2.2 stabilizes. If you really
really want it I might even be persuadable to make a version
for kernel 2.2.0-preWhatever, but don't count on that...
