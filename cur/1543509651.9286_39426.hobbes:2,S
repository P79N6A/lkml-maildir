Hi!
  I have observed a very strange thing.
  I always  run a  "top" command  in an  X window,  beacuse I  like to
watch system data.
  There was  a buggy procps  package in debian  in last days,  and top
was missing (2.0.3-1). Then I wrote my "top" script:
  watch -n 1 'uptime; free; ps axuw --sort=-start_time'
  Until that, my  machine seems to be much more faster!  It seems like
a computer,  which has 128M  memory(and it  has). Before that  I often
get constant swapping when I open a large window in netscape.
  I feel that  "top" fragments the virtual memory and the  swap, but I
don't know how.
  Sounds interesting?
  I'm using  2.2.10 kernel  with a "restricted  proc" patch.  But this
problem  is stands  from the  early 2.2  until 2.2.10  (>2.2.10 I  had
problems, that's why I use that).
  I  have  tried  2.3.17  also,  and it  seems  to  have  the  similar
problem, but I have some strange IPC problems, so I didn't test it.
  Do you have any idea about it?
  Please Cc:  to me this  thread, because I  am not subscribed  to the
