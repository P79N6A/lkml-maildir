I was reading over your libata driver yesterday.  Certainly a lot
cleaner than the cam stuff IMHO.  Given the info made available
via the Promise driver, I expect that I could get an initial
libata host adaptor driver hacked together in short order.  After
all, the Intel one is just 400 lines.  So unless you (or anyone
else) have already started or would prefer to do the honors,
I'll try to hack something together this evening,
