Oh isn't coding style fun.  I personally hate code that doesn't ALWAYS
have the braces everywhere since it makes adding a print statement
or other debuging to the condition such a pain since you then have to
add braces to the condition to avoid breaking the code just to insert
a print statement.  It is one of the few things I disagree with in the
linux kernel coding style.
