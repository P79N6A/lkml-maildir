I got a bug report about an issue with LVM in 2.5.22-dj1, which turns
out to be caused by broken /proc/partitions in mainline.
(davej@mesh:davej)$ cat /proc/partitions 
major minor  #blocks  name
   8     0          0 sda
  22     0 1515870810 hdc
  22    64 1515870810 hdd
   3     0   29316672 hda
   3     1     117400 hda1
   3     2          1 hda2
   3     5     999904 hda5
   3     6    1499872 hda6
   3     7     683392 hda7
   3     8   26015944 hda8
   3    64 1515870810 hdb
Note the huge numbers in hex are 0x5a5a5a5a, so something
seems to be getting poisoned somewhere.
Also, should partitions with 0 blocks be showing up ?
I don't recall that happening with the old-style 2.4 code.
