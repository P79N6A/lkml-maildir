So if the header is overwritten before the pages are read back in, that
implies that the overwriting IO did not get to disk in my failing case.
Since pleny of other IO did end up on disk (scribbling on my ext3 in the
process), I wonder what could be different there...

One root partition, one swap partition, no swap files or anything.
The only interesting thing I can think of is that my swap partition is
only 512MB while the machine has 1.25GB RAM.  (Installed Ubuntu and took
the defaults before installing the SODIMM.)
FWIW, I have suspended and resumed a few times since the failure and
haven't seen a repeat of the problem.  I am seeing some other problems
with 2.6.13-rc2-mm1 that I didn't see before - DRM/i830 lockups after
swsusp - that might be masking the problem, but I have done the
boot-swsusp-resume-swsusp-resume successfully.
I'm at a loss as to what I might have done to trigger the problem.
