What do you mean by "BROKEN" ?  Anything in syslog?  tcpdumps?
Why not test wsize=rsize=1K for the Linux/Solaris combo?
Also, I was unaware that TCP server was supposed to work in 2.4.0-test9.
(It isn't in the 2.2.x patches.)  Are you sure that Solaris is not falling
back to UDP mounts?

The conservatism is similar to that for IDE tuning: many folks have
broken hardware/drivers/networks, and sizes above 1K result in
fragmentation/potential packet loss/RPC timeouts/write errors/corruption.
So for 2.2.x, Alan has decreed 1K size.  2.4.0-test is a bit more aggressive.
32K is fine, if you are using TCP.  But I just went through a day-long
session with NetApp after they updated their default UDP size from 8K
to 32K.  32K UDP == 23 fragments.  On a switched network that may be
fine, but with a hub and router, it is seeming death.  Our Solaris
clients were generating numerous RPC timeouts on writes.  After setting
the NetApp F720 server default back to 8K, the timeouts went away.
You may want to take this over to nfs@sourceforge.net; also, tcpdumps
are helpful.
