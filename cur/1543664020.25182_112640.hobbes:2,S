Are you sure that this will help?
With a smaller table, you might cause fewer cache misses for the table 
lookup. Instead you get longer hash chains. Walking linked lists 
probably causes more cache line misses than the single array lookup.
Dave, how many entries are in the dcache?
Btw, has anyone tried to replaced the global dcache with something 
local, perhaps a tree instead of d_child, and then lookup in d_child_tree?
