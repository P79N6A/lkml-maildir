My guess is that Nick believes that the value in *pslot cannot change
in such as way as to cause radix_tree_is_indirect_ptr()'s return value
to change within a given RCU grace period, and that Linus disagrees.
Whatever the answer, I would argue for -at- -least- a comment explaining
why it is safe.  I am not seeing the objection to rcu_dereference(), but
I must confess that it has been awhile since I have looked closely at
the radix_tree code.  :-/
