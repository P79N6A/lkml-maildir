    Not if you want compatibility.
I don't think compatibility is a problem.
It would go like this: at configure time you get the
choice of the default initrd or a custom initrd.
If you choose the custom one you construct it yourself.
If you choose the default one, then you get something
that comes together with the kernel image, just like
the piggyback stuff today. This default initrd does
the partition parsing that up to now the kernel did.
That way nobody need to notice a difference, except for
those who use initrd already now. They can solve their
problems.
