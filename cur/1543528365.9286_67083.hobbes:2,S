It's kernel stack: sys_recvfrom() has a 128 byte buffer named `address' from
which it is copied.
I have a fix but it causes routed to fail for another reason. To recall:
	recvfrom(fd, &inbuf, sizeof (inbuf), 0, &from, &fromlen);
routed explicitly tests for a fromlen == sizeof(struct sockaddr_in) which is
16 byte. However, the result returned in `from' is only 8 bytes, and fromlen
is set in accordance now by my patch (and the extra data isn't copied).
Ok, I could fix the broken program but I think a lot of other programs have
the same behavior. This routed is bundled with RedHat 6.1
Don't know how POSIX (1003.1g?) defines this. Propose: make fromlen 16
again and add 8 zeroed bytes to the real from address for compatibility.
