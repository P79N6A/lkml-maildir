Actually he is right. You have to know the ACPI object in order to run
the _GTM/_STM etc functions. If you don't run those your suspend/resume
may not work, may corrupt and so on. The only safe alternative is to
disable acpi which, while it would have been a good idea before the spec
ever got out, is a bit late now.
If you don't run the resume methods your disk subsystem status after a
resume is simply undefined and unsafe.
