Subject: i386 doublefault handler is broken with CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The new percpu code has apparently broken the doublefault handler
when CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK is set. Doublefault is handled by
a hardware task, making the check
        SPIN_BUG_ON(lock->owner == current, lock, "recursion");
fault because it uses the FS register to access the percpu data
for current, and that register is zero in the new TSS. (The trace
I saw was on 2.6.20 where it was GS, but it looks like this will
still happen with FS on 2.6.22.)
Initializing FS in the doublefault_tss should fix it.
