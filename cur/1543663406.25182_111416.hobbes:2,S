Petr,
I submitted the Tile Blitting patch to James some time ago, it has
tilefill, tilecopy and tileblit hooks.  These hooks should eliminate the
"multiply in fbcon, divide in driver" bottleneck.
It should result in the same behavior as you would expect in the the 2.4
API, so you can use text mode with your matroxfb driver.  These same
hooks will also help optimize drawing if we need to use fonts like
12x22.
