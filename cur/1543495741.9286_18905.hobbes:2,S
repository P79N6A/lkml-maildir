Yah,
another me too,
since this is a headless machine I can't tell what was still running
and what not.
Anyway ->
	SMP (dual P2)
	mixed IDE and SCSI
	huge web server (2 x 9GB, imagine fscking that)
	mailserver and realaudio encoder and server
as I was logged through ssh I just experienced complete hang, not even
a ping reply ...
Any further info available on request.
