No, you can apply the debugjiffies patch which basically sets your time
to -5 min at boot to test the wrapping. Anyway, believe me, it works, I
successfully wrapped twice on 2.4.18 a long time ago, and it was not
that clean by this time.

No, because it uses dirty (but very clever) tricks to avoid locking around
the jiffies manipulations, and 2.4 is in critical fixes-only mode right now.
