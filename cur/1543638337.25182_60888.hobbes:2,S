Well, any _sane_ prefetch API would be safe.
However, there is known-broken hardware out there, in which a prefetch
from IO space will kill the machine.
Personally, I would just say that we should disable prefetch on such
clearly broken hardware, but since it's Alans favourite machine (some
early AMD Athlon if I remember correctly), I think Alan will disagree ;)

That's true of just about any other architecture too. I think the AMD case
is an erratum, so even on AMD it is _supposed_ to work.
