A cleaned up and 2.6 ported VIA velocity driver is now available on
ftp://people/redhat.com/alan/Kernel/.
 This is an initial clean up and
port to 2.6. It isn't by any means polished yet. Please send test results
and patches to me (I don't currently read linux-kernel).
It should work on both 32 and 64bit little endian, it won't work on big
endian boxes yet.
