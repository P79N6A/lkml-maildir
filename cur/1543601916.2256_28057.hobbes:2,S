Subject: smbmount is unfriendly to RO root fs

Hello Samba folks,
I keep my root fs RO.
My /etc/mtab is symlinked to /proc/mounts.
When i try
# mount -t smbfs //host/share /mnt
mount fails trying to modify /etc/mtab.
# mount -n -t smbfs //host/share /mnt
fails too ( -n is unsupported for smbmount)
Moreover, since I use automount, even fixing smbmount
to support -n would not work: automount will not
pass -n to smbmount.
The most sensible way to make smbmount work is to
print some diagnostic ("can't update /etc/mtab")
and continue.
And yes, I verified that with RW root fs it works.
Given amount of troubles I have with RO root,
I think not many people actually trying this
(which is excellent security measure),
and lots of tools break (ldconfig, /dev/log etc etc etc).
