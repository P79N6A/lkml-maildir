I want that too for some other unrelated patches :) I want request_irq()
to use alloc_bootmem when slab is not available so that some low level
arch irqs can be requested at init_IRQ() time.
(Typically IRQs for cascaded controllers). We currently define
statically irqaction structures for them and call setup_irq() on them,
this is gross :)
Cheers,
Ben.
