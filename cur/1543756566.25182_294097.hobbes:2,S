The purpose of the scatterlists is to be able to process discontigous data 
at the page level.
The tweak, as I understand it, is something which you generate, and it is 
not inherently likely to be page-level clumps of data.  It does not ever 
need to be kmapped.
What you really need to do is use an array for the tweak (or possibly a
structure which maintains state about it if needed).
