Sure, user space can do silly things. Just ask davej. Let's try to

Bad idea... it means user space will have to try to open different files
and what happens when someone introduces a new unit? Ideally I'd like
the unit to be part of the payload of the sysfs file. Second to that I
think having the unit in a separate file is preferable.
