Well, you could also make the voice-aware shell as the default shell for
a given user, but that would not work for install systems like kudzu
where you are not in control of the boot environment (for that matter you
are not in control of the kernel for those systems either, so it doesn't
really matter).
Probably a good example of how this would work is screen(1) (as you have
mentioned) or script(1) which is a lot more light weight but may have
the necessary code to start from.
For X you could also make the voice recognition system an input method
(ala mouse, keyboard, tablet, joystick, etc), but that would only work
for X.  Come to think of it, doesn't the kernel already have an "input"
driver section for such things?
