This could only happen when: dirty_thresh < nr_cpus * per_cpu_max_delta

That could be modeled on the error limit I have. For this particular
case that would end up looking like:
  nr_online_cpus * pcp->stat_threshold.

As outlined above, and I don't think we'll ever have such a low
dirty_limit. But who knows :-)

I'm with Andrew on this, that is, quite puzzled on how all this arises.
Testing those writeback-fix-* patches might help rule out (or point to)
a mis-function of pdflush.
The theory that one task will spin in balance_dirty_pages() on a
bdi that does not actually have many dirty pages, doesn't sound
plausible because eventually the total dirty count (well, actually
dirty+unstable+writeback) should subside again. This theory can
cause crappy latencies, but should not 'hang' the machine.

Are we actually holding i_mutex on paths that lead into
balance_dirty_pages? that does (from my admittedly limited knowledge of
the vfs) sound like trouble, since we'd need it to complete writeback.
All quite puzzling.
