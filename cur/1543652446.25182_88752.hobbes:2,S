Nah, it's most likely not telling you anything like that.  Your log:
	Nov 12 09:08:41 lothlorien kernel: memory : ca174cd0
	Nov 12 09:08:41 lothlorien kernel: memory : 00000000
	Nov 12 09:08:41 lothlorien kernel: memory : ca174410
	Nov 12 09:08:42 lothlorien kdm[4949]: session start failed
	Nov 12 09:08:43 lothlorien kernel: memory : ca174cd0
