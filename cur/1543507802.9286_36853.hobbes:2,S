That's logical. If you set an environment variable, it is only
present in the process you set it in, and the children of those
processes. There's no way to set environment variables of unrelated
processes.
However you can do this in /etc/initscript. Since init is the parent
of _all_ processes, it's environment will propagate to all processes
on the system. Read the manual page for initscript(5).
No guarantee that it will be set in interactive sessions as well
since a lot of programs, like login, clean up their environment
before starting a new session.
Mike.
