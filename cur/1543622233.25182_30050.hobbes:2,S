Is this really anything other than syntactic sugar?  Maybe it's different 
in drivers, but I find myself doing the following in user space all the time
	#define	unless(x)	if (!(x))	/* perl/BCPL corrupted me */
	function(...)
	{
		char	*foo = 0, *bar = 0;
		int	locked = 0;
		int	rc = -1;
		if (bad args or something) {
	out:		if (foo) free(foo);
			if (bar) free(bar);
			if (locked) unlock();
			return (rc);
		}
		unless (locked = get_the_lock()) goto out;
		unless (foo = allocate_foo()) goto out;
		unless (bar = allocate_bar()) goto out;
		more code....
		rc = 0;
		goto out;
	}
It seems ugly at first but it has some nice attributes:
    a) all the cleanup is in one place, for both the error path and the 
       non-error path.  I could put it at the bottom, I like it at the
       top because that's where I tend to have the list of things needed
       to be cleaned.
    b) all the error cases are branches, the normal path is straightline.
    c) it's as dense as I can make it.
So how would you do the same thing with exceptions?
