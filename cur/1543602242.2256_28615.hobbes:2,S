I'm trying to design a simple 2D game for linux, mainly as a way to learn
as much as I can about the linux kernel, graphics hardware, and whatever
lies between.  It would basically involve shooting little alpha-blended
spaceships that would fade in (becoming more and more opaque) and move
around the screen (all the while being blended over a scrolling
background).
I've searched for and read some information on all of the things listed in
the subject line of this message.  I've learned a thing or two, but I'm
still not confident enough in my understanding of them to choose one and
start writing code.  Indeed, some of them are based on others, so I may
have to choose two.  :)
If my ultimate goal is a maximum level of hardware acceleration,
especially for scrolling and alpha-blending, which linux graphics
interface would be the best choice for my needs?
Please note that my question is a theoretical one, not a practical one.
I'm not asking which system currently has the best accelerated drivers;
I'm asking which one has the best potential for taking advantage of all a
card has to offer.
It might be that my very question is flawed.  If so, please enlighten me!
I'm not subscribed, so please kindly Cc me in your reply.
Thanks!
