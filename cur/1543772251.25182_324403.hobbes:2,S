Subject: [GIT PATCH] Another PCI fix for 2.6.12-rc6
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/9/189

Narendra from Broadcom pointed out that the following patch had not made
it into your tree (it was in mine for a long time, along with the -mm
releases).  It is needed for 2.6.12 because:
	"Broadcom already submitted the bnx2 driver for the 5706 gigabit
	driver which enables MSI on all systems that support PCI-X. That
	patch has already gone into 2.6.12-rc6. So if the MSI disable
	patch does not get into 2.6.12, anyone who uses the 5706 on the
	Serverworks chipset platform, will have interrupt failures."
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-2.6.git/
The full patch will be sent to the linux-kernel and linux-pci mailing
lists, if anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
