I built and installed the kernel yesterday. All seemed to work fine. This
morning when I arrived at work, I started a large FTP download (>400MB)
and it started locking up every few minutes. I noticed it when name
lookups started timing out.
I backed out the change, rebooted the new kernel, and started the FTP
download again and I got the complete file (about 1.5 hrs of downloading)
without problems.
