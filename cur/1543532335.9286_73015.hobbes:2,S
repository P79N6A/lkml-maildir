hi,
patch for drivers/char/pc_keyb.c to allow the mouse to function
(noramlly) after unplugging it and plugging it back in (or using
a KVM switch). Basically all it does is check if scancode==170 
for the mouse port. If it is, it resets the mouse data buffer, then
sends the mouse a reENABLE signal that effectively resets mouse.
I've searched for documentation on the ps2 protocol to no avail,
so the scancode==170 might not work for _all_ ps2 mice, but I've 
tested with 2 different logitech and one MS mouse. FWIW, the keyboard
I have sends the same signal on reconnect. If this patch won't
work for you (or if it is completely braindead:), please let me know.
cheers.
	brent
