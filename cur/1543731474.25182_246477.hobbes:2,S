Well, it's definitely no surprise, you simply can't push the
uncompressed stream through USB1.1.
Us in robotics, we use the iBot2 from Orange Micro, which is an USB2.0
webcam working nicely with Linux at 30fps, 640x480, truecolor,
uncompressed.
So I don't think that Philips would really be able to "hide" this fact
by putting the decompressors into a binary only module - everybody knows
the compression must be lossy to allow for this high a compression
ratio.
Also, it's quite obvious that there is a big tradeoff between image
quality and algorithm complexity - it might be possible do do JPEG
compression in the webcam at full framerate and a reasonably low price,
but simpler algorithms with worse image quality still be well usable and
make the price even lower.
