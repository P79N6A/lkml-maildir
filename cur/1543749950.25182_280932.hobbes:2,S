When the workload is a gcc run, the pagefault handler dominates the system
time.  That's the page zeroing.

x86's movnta instructions provide a way of initialising memory without
trashing the caches and it has pretty good bandwidth, I believe.  We should
wire that up to these patches and see if it speeds things up.

40GB/s.  Is that straight into L1 or does the measurement include writeback?
