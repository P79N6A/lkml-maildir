Sorry, but this is just too trivial to be worth the processing.  The
compiler is perfectly capable of retaining the `blocksize * 8' result for
later use and this part of your patch actually increases the code size
slightly.

I don't know what this means.

There is no such thing as journal_update.  I assume you're referring to the
handling of the "journal=update" mount option.  Please be more careful when
identifying these things.

No, I see no need to be able to convert an ext2 filesystem to ext3 within
the kernel.  Nobody will bother to work on this.
