It is:
[  156.094049] sys_vm86old called by monitor-get-edi
[  156.243660] sys_vm86old called by monitor-get-edi
[  285.698333] sys_vm86old called by X
[  285.699408] sys_vm86old called by X
[  285.699813] sys_vm86old called by X
any chance the specific function that is invoked is not implemented? 
Because at least X apparently does not always fail video BIOS call - how 
can I catch which calls were successful and which failed? I understand 
return path sys_vm86old is rather non-standard.
