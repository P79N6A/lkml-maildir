It appears that checkpoint fw-1 that is here spoils everything so that
current linux boxes need to disable tcp_windows_scaling to get
reasonable throughput. When I switched a server to a different link
that bypasses checkpoint it worked well.
Although it most propably is checkpoint's fault (This one is based on
linux 2.4.9-39cpsmp) I belive that the change in the kernel that started
producing these problems is this one:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/cset@1.1784.10.7?nav=index.html
|ChangeSet@-3w
When I removed this patch from a 2.6.8-rc1 kernel it started to work
good again. But of course it may be a blind shot.
I am planning on investigating this issue from the checkpoint's
perspective.
Anyway if there is anyone willing to investigate the tcpdumps and
tcptraces of the slow/fast throughput, here it is:

I am no guru, but it shows:
1) slower throughput
2) twice as much packets exchanged
3) different advertised windows
