I was hoping that it could be still fixed for 2.6.28. Perhaps
that would be too intrusive that late? That is why I hope
it can be still considered even if it's x86 only.
For .29 I suspect in fact the best way would be to just move it into linux
and use a superset because I don't think it's a big problem to waste 3-4
pages of virtual space for this.

So are you submitting this?
