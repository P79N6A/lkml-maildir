That's not completely true...
The hardware keeps track of the mouse counter (but may overflow).
The mouse counters are checked periodically (in an interrupt, IIRC) and the
sprite position is updated.
So there's no real difference from a hardware point of view between Amiga
mouse/sprite hardware and PCs with PS/2 or serial mice and hardware cursors.
Both mouse counters and serial buffers can overflow, though ;-)

Last time I tried it was worse than AmigaOS.

What about Roman Zippel? And you can always try the linux-m68k list ;-)

The biggest part of the responsiveness comes from the cheap context switching.
Not needing a MMU can have its advantages... Plus there's no demand paging or
swapping to wait for.
That's also the reason why you can have higher serial speed under AmigaOS than
under Linux/m68k: a serial port with a 1-byte buffer needs fast and cheap
context switching.
