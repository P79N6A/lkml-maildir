- are you using netfilter?
- cat /proc/net/dev, what does the fifo counter say when iface hung?
- it degrades over time and only after quite a bit of data pumped
  through it does it hang right? and slowly decreasing throughput right?
- I feel much better to know someone else has this bug! I thought sure I
  was crazy since I did not hear of this problem from anyone else and
  905B is very common card.

wait this worked or didn't? for me 2.4.7 works fine, 2.4.17 does not.

yep, same thing here...I was to try 2.4.7 3c59x.c with otherwise recent
kernel but have not got around to this yet...
