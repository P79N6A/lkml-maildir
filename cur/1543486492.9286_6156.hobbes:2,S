Not very in general. If you run bios code in DOSemu it tends to play with
the PC 8259 interrupt controller a lot ad sometimes the timers. Not stuff
Linux can afford to permit.
The BIOS hd driver only worked for a few cases. Its only really alive and well
in the Linux 8086 tree where its not a problem calling bios functions
