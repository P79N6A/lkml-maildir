Filesystem level interaction via bonnie++.  Basic repro is, using ccaputo 
user, is:
  mke2fs -j -L /xxx /dev/sdb1
  mount -t ext2 /dev/sdb1 /xxx
  cd /xxx ; mkdir ccaputo ; chown ccaputo ccaputo ; cd ccaputo ; su ccaputo
  /usr/sbin/bonnie++
Filesystem is believed to be sound since it is from a fresh mke2fs.
The one strange thing I do is that I format it as ext3 (-j) but mount it 
as ext2, but I didn't think that would be an issue and I'd be surprised if 
Erich is doing the same in his tests, which also fail, with ext2.  (I do 
it in case I later decide to mount the volume as ext3.)
