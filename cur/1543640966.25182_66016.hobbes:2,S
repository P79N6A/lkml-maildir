dhinds pointed me to a recent thread with another possible workaround:
The ICH-3M bridge is actually a transparent bridge that forwards all 
memory IO:
<<<< ich-3M datasheet (29071601.pdf)
MEMBASE Memory Base Register (HUB-PCI D30:F0)
Offset Address: 20 21h Attribute: R/W
Default Value: FFF0h Size: 16 bits
This register defines the base of the hub interface to PCI 
non-prefetchable memory range. Since the ICH3 will forward all hub 
interface memory accesses to PCI, the ICH3 will only use this 
information for determining when not to accept cycles as a target. This 
register must be initialized by the configuration software. For the 
purpose of address decode, address bits A[19:0] are assumed to be 0. 
Thus, the bottom of the defined memory address range will be aligned to 
a 1-MB boundary.
<<<<
Perhaps a pci-quirk should set
	bus->resource[1] = bus->parent->resource[1];
for the ICH-3M.
No patch, I don't understand the pci layer good enough to write such a 
quirk.
But IMHO the changes to yenta.c should be applied anyway: allocating 8 
MB, without any fallback, without reasonable error output is gross.
