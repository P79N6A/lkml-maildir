Subject: [PATCH 18/18] Straight file moves
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/14/18

Here's a list of files that were moved from either i386 or x86_64 over
to the arch/x86 directory.  Since I now used the git-diff -M option
(thanks Linus!), and to spare LKML with a lot of patches, I put all
the renames that were unmodified (strictly renamed) into this file,
with one exception.  I put the moving of the speedstep-lib.h file
in it's own file to allow for discussion on that, (ok Chris).
