Not a good idea.
We still want to find zombie processes, since they show up in "ps"  
listings etc. And I don't think sending a signal to a zombie process
should return ESRCH, since it's there.
Btw, I fixed it by making all wake-up events give a mask of which states 
can be woken up. That's really what SIGCONT wanted anyway (only wake up 
stopped tasks), _and_ it's what default_wake_function() really wanted.
