glibc cannot ever be smart enough because a file system driver will  
always know better and be able to do things in a much more optimized  
way.
For example on NTFS fallocate() only needs to involve the setting of  
a few bits in the volume block allocation bitmap (one bit for each  
logical block being allocated) and update the extent map in the on- 
disk inode to reflect that those blocks are now allocated to the  
inode.  Then it just needs to update the allocated size and  
optionally the data size (if fallocate wants to increase the file  
size rather than just the allocated size).  And that is it.  No  
zeroing needs to happen at all because we have not updated the  
initialized size of the inode!
glibc can only dream of an implementation like this.  (-;
