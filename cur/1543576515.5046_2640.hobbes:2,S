I've recently found a (very) small bug in the IP MASQ FTP module, and I've 
already gone ahead and changed the code on my machine to fix it.  However,
 I cannot find out who to send this information to so it can be worked into 
the kernel!
Anyone know?  If anyone else wants the info, feel free to email me.
Thanks!
