We had 5 machines broken into last night all but one with kernel 2.6.8
and found a binary "krad-no-longer-private.c" had  been downloaded
It contains the string:
k-rad.c - linux 2.6.* CPL 0 kernel exploit 
Discovered Jan 2005 by sd <sd@fucksheep.org>
If you want to look at it, I've copied it (with mode set to 444 of
course) to www.xisl.com/hack
Hope that is helpful
