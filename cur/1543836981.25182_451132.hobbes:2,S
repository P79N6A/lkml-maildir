Which is something we certainly have to be careful with.

Actually it refers to both.
Basically we detect if we were loaded with a clueless bootloader,
aka at 1MB.  If so we just load to whatever address the code was built
to run at.  Otherwise the code stays put.
To be loaded and run at a different address is what is needed for the
crash dump scenario.  Where we have to run at some reserved area
of physical memory that the original kernel did not run from.
