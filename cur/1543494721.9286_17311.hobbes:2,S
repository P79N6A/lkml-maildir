I'm trying to create more than 64K user accounts on a Linux Intel box, but i
already know that it can't be done, so my only hope right now is that Alpha
or Sparc Linux does support more than 64K users... is that true?
if it's true, please point me to some URL's where i can find information or
documents that said so. if not, are there any patches, modules, or magic
potions that can solve this?...
Any help will be apreciated.
