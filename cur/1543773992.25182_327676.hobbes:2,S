First of all, this shouldn't result in problems like the one he 
reported (see my other mail).
And I'm surprised you are saying this. I'd have expected that running 
"make oldconfig" with a 2.4 kernel should give him a working 
configuration.
Can you explain where you'd expect problems so that we can fix them?
