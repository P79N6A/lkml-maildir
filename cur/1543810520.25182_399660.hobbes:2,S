    [PATCH] kbuild: revert "fix make -jN with multiple targets with O=..."
    
    Commit 296e0855b0f9a4ec9be17106ac541745a55b2ce1:
    
        "kbuild: fix make -jN with multiple targets with O=..."
    
    causes a ~95% increase in build time for the kernel.  Before: 4m21s
    after: 8m1.403s.  Can we revert this until another approach is found?
