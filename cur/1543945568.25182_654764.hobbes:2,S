Well, eventhough the author may not know how to use it, "unlikely" at
least indicates the intention of the author, or his knowledge of what
should happen here. I'd suggest leaving it where it is because the
authot of this code is in best position to know that this branch is
unlikely to happen, eventhough he does not correctly use the macro.
