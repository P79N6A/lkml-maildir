There used to be a patch floating around to do policy for file caches
(or rather arbitary address spaces)
It used special ELF headers to set the policy. I thought about these policy EAs 
long ago. The main reason I never liked them much is that on some EA
implementations you have to fetch an separate block to get at the EA.
And this policy EA would need to be read all the time, thus adding lots
of additional seeks. That didn't seem worth it.

If you do policy you could as well do the full policy states from
mempolicy.c. Both cache:local and cache:global can be expressed in it.

In practice it will probably only set for a small minority of objects
if at all. I could imagine admining this policy could be a PITA too.

I think we are much better off with some sensible defaults for file cache
- global or "nearby" for read/write
- global for inode/dcache
- local for mmap file data
I bet that will cover most cases quite nicely.
