Yes that was the stream of "unimplemented" errors we started seeing on new 
gccs that couldn't inline and said so. The build process is mystical and 
somewhat random in order but I guessed if it encounters this first it should 
be able to inline it. However as I said I don't really need it inlined.

It probably just fools it... Will probably warn on newer gccs soon.

Well I could always just put it in a header file under CONFIG_SWAP_PREFETCH.. 
I was trying to do the swap.c thing that akpm suggested though.
