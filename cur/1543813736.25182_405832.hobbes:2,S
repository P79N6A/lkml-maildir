OK, this is the other possibility. It'll leave a hole in the KERN_
sysctl numbering, but that's not a problem AFAICT.
I would however at least annotate with FIXME and make a note that it's
gonna change in 2.7.
It's hard to tell how many people depend on suid_dumpable being at the
wrong location. The fact nobody noticed it being placed wrongly would
make me suspect it's not widely used yet (it only got introduced
2005-06-23 by Alan Cox). So I would prefer to move it to the correct
location now rather than in 2.7. By the time 2.7 comes, we may have so
many users, we may not want to correct this any more at all.

I don't think we break anything we want to maintain. 
Kernel-internal defines? 
OK to change when going from 2.6.15 to 2.6.16 IMVHO. No module
compiled for 2.6.15 will work with 2.6.16 anyway.
Best,
