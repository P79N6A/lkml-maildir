I guess that at least Jens and I (not trying to speak for Jens)
see it as a style issue and somewhat as an education issue.
At least we both used /IMO/i.

| Well, this is a rather big and particularly rancid can of worms.  If you look

I'm not sure that it could ever get by Jens, but I'll take a look at it.
