So build with make C=2 -D__CHECK_ENDIAN__ net/ieee80211/, etc. - it's not
that such a script would be tricky...
I've been shooting the endianness crap down for quite a while (see e.g.
drivers/net/* patches in 2.6.24 and 2.6.24-rc1; there's more in queue)
and it's getting better, but not enough to enable it unconditionally.
Note that it's not quite a janitor-level stuff; blind "fixing" of warnings
in that area is very likely to result in hidden bugs - you need serious
RTFS + RTFDatasheet + ask maintainer + trawl list archives for bug reports
in quite a few cases.
