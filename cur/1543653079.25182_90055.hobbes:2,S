Both reorganizing the per-cpu thread pools as state machines and
inserting new locking look like work-intensive projects...
It's not become explosively bad yet (1MB of overhead is eyebrow-raising
but not particularly damaging) so there's no rush to trim this down,
but I'm at least thinking about doing this later. One of the major
obstacles for the state machine approach is that the migration threads
run at RT priority while the rest do not, and of course the greater
than per-cpu granularity approach suffers from additional locking.
