This is an issue directly to be taken up with the manufacturer and is a
bit off topic here. RedHat 9 professional can conceivably disallow
parameter passing. The fact that a system does not, out of the box, allow
for break-ins is a good thing(tm) for most part...  manually editing
password files is a bad thing(tm), this is why command line tools such as
useradd are provided.
Any how, I hope you got it all fixed.
Cheers,
Ahmed.
