Yes, that was precisely what was happening in raid1. There were
"nested" spin_lock_irq() calls.

I was wondering about the performance of these. I was reluctant 
to change all occurrences of spin_lock_irq() to the save/restore 
versions, even though that seemed like the safest thing to do, so 
I had to analyze every code path where spin_locks were involved 
to see which ones absolutely needed to change...very tedious. 
Thanks for the explanations.
