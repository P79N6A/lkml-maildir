.git/config now includes
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[remote "origin"]
        url = /pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master

Now "git branch -a" shows
* master
  origin/master
It is missing "origin/HEAD"

git log origin and git log origin/master both return
"ambiguous argument 'origin': unknown revision"
I must be misunderstanding the syntax/manpage of git-log but "git diff
-m -r origin/master"
now works fine and displays exactly what I expect so things have improved.

This seems plausible and
