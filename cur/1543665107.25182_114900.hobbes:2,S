Usually, it would not make any difference. However, there is a
de facto standard to not use "__functions" or "__macros" directly
in code. Those are the things that the integrator will change to
accommodate different configurations, i.e., whether you are running
on a '386, '686, PPC or Sparc, SMP/High-memory, etc. So, you use
function() instead of _function() or __function().  If you use this
standard you might start out with this in some header:
#define function(p)  __function(p)
But in SMP machines, you might need some other code. Rather than
you having to modify your source, some header changes the definition
and it might become:
#define function(p) do{ MB(); __function(p); } while (0)
How, if you had executed __function() directly in your code,
you end up tossing that driver into the scrap-heap until it
gets fixed for SMP.
Bottom line; Look at the headers. If you have a choice, don't
use a function or macro that has leading underscores. If you
copy "working" drivers, you can be copying latent bugs. Don't
blindly go where others have gone (Star-Trek fans blink).
