Naveen,
thanks alot for testing the driver further and finding these bugs. I've 
not been able to do so myself as the only computers available to me with 
this watchdog are production-servers meaning that I've only been able to 
test during scheduled downtimes.
Have you tested and verified that the driver works after these patches 
have been applied?
Re,
David
