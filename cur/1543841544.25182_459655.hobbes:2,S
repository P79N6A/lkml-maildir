Or writing some chars twice but at a different time. The system might be 
one of those that fakes serial console output on the assumption the 
operating system isn't doing the same thing. I've seen one or two blade

That is a bit of a sickener. It may be worth getting your good lab tech 
to check if there is a configuration setting in the hardware for 
simulating console output before you make the trip.
