I did this about a year ago, and it is merged into the kernel.
See MAX_USER_RT_PRIO and MAX_RT_PRIO in <linux/sched.h>.
We just need to change MAX_RT_PRIO to, say, (MAX_USER_RT_PRIO + 10).
The one kicker is if we end up changing the size of BITMAP_SIZE, the
default sched_find_first_bit() will break and we will need to implement
a new one. I did a generic one, as well as code to detect at
compile-time which to use, but the optimized one is a lot nicer. On
32-bit machines, the BITMAP_SIZE ends up being 160-bits
(5*sizeof(unsigned long)) so there are about 20 extra priority levels
one can add "for free."
