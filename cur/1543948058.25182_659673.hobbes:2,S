I don't know who told you that or why, but it's obvious nonsense, as this
issue shows. Exports should be marked GPL if and only if they cannot be used
except in a derivative work. If it is possible to use them without taking
sufficient protectable expression, they should not be marked GPL.
This was what everyone agreed to when GPL exports were created.
