Could you elaborate on the reason you want to keep the minor space
compact?  I don't regard the insmod/rmmod problem as valid because if
you do:
rmmod ips.o
rmmod qla2300.o
insmod qla2300.o
insmod ips.o
All bets are off again. For small kernel dev_t it was essential to keep
a compact minor space because otherwise we coulde run out of minors. 
Sparse minors cause no inefficiency in the mid-layer, or in sd.  There
are problems in sg which could be solved by encoding the device type in
the minor.

Please, no.  Dividing up the minor space like this would be a step
backwards (adding more policy to the kernel).  Someone would also have
to manage this scheme.
