Do not try to replace one dead program by another one....
If you like actively maintained software you need to look here:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/alpha/
http://cdrecord.berlios.de/new/private/cdrecord.html
The main problem with cdparanoia is that it is based on a 10 year old cdda2wav.
Even if Monty did start working on it again, he would not change that.
Sending bad SCSI commands is a result of bad low level code from an 
extremely old cdda2wav version.
Libparanoia in cdrtools is based on the assets of the cdparanoia program.
The software has been made portable and several bugs have been removed by me.
BYW: The next plan with cdda2wav is to add C2-pointer support and to allow
libparanoia to know whether a sector was bad or not even if a bad sector
will re-read the same for every try. This will make cdda2wav behave better
with extremely bad/scratched media.
