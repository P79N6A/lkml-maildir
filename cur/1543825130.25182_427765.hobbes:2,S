Not the Fedora kernels, but the ones I'm bisecting have the same .config
(modulus "make oldconfig").  I did lose some time when somehow SMP got
enabled between the test of 2.6.16 and 2.6.17-rc1.  I ended up testing
2.6.17-rc1 without suspend being in the kernel (that kernel wouldn't
suspend).  After that, I have been verifying that each kernel will have
suspend compiled in before the hour long make session.
