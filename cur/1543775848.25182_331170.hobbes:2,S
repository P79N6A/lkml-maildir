Hi,
I see that the mouse seem to be detected properly... I wonder if some
of the extended probes confuse it. Could you try doing:
         rmmod psmouse
         insmod /lib/modules/`uname
-r`/kernel/drivers/input/mouse/psmouse.ko proto=bare
and 
         rmmod psmouse
         insmod /lib/modules/`uname
-r`/kernel/drivers/input/mouse/psmouse.ko proto=imps
And tell me if any of them work?
Thanks!
