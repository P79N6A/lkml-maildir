First, please CC me or linuxppc-dev at least on PowerMac related

Looks like the dbdma channel is stuck. I'll investigate. (Note,
Christoph Hellwig is now maintaining this driver in 2.6, also note
that Linus tree misses some sound bits, you may want to use my
bk tree from bk://ppc.bkbits.net/linuxppc-2.5-benh for now, I hope
to have everything merged upstream by 2.6.1)

You aren't using the proper video driver it seems.
