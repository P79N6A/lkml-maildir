Maybe but drive/chipset combination is more likely. The one being out of 
spec is unknown to me.
Note :
What I don't understand is why you need the hdparm -d1 : from your boot 
log, the kernel already set DMA for you.

These come after (probably when hdparm -d1 is called)
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x61
hda: timeout waiting for DMA
hda: timeout waiting for DMA
hda: (__ide_dma_test_irq) called while not waiting
My clue :

Hum, I have a WDC WD800BB-32CCB0 here and it is the only one that wouldn't work correctly with my SiS735-based K7S5A (sometimes values returned by the drive including its id string had one bit forced to 1 or 0, had to reboot to fix the issue).
Try a different drive...
