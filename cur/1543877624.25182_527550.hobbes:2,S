There is a "presentable patch" in the attachment ;)
so far, the bluetooth also can not work :( TODO, TODO
TODO list include usbhid blacklist match logic should be move to HID
core too.
But It have a very very strange problem on my PC yet. I have two USB
input devices at that machine, one is a wireless mouse, another is a
joystick. When I unplug joystick, the input_dev of mouse also will be
unregistered, I found the unregister_hid_device() is called from
hid_disconnect().
I can sure the hardware have no problem, they work fine under 2.6.17.9
without any change of kernel. May, I doublt it is caused by illegal
memory access likely, or I failed to understand USB core ?! FIXING, The
fun also here.
The hiddump is good idea, I like, however, I think hidraw just is it.
the hiddump is one application of hidraw. is it right?
Good luck.
