I've repeated the test and found that our side sees the packets with a broken
TCP checksum.  The real reason is a broken NAT device in Netscape which is
unable to properly calculate the checksum of a packet with rewritten PASV
address/port in presence of timestamps.
Our kernel behaves absolutely correct: it logs and drops the broken packets.
