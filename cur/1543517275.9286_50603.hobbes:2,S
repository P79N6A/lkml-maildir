Thanks for the reply Stephen.
(when I said I'd taken the ramdisk out of the buffer cache, I meant only
the persistent data.. copied that unconditionally to/from vmalloc'd area
instead of pegging down buffers.  works fine but is slooo)
The attached against 2.3.28 is faster, but I _hate_ the copy on write.
I tried (like hell) to avoid it by looking to see if a stale buffer
existed, bforget() the old data and peg down the new data.  That didn't
work worth spit (corruption/oops/OOM/hardlock/softlock.. pick one:) and
I wish I knew why.
For blocksize = PAGE_SIZE ramdisks, I _think_ I could avoid the copy by
keeping track of allocated blocks and when a write request comes in do
something like..
	if (block_table[blk] != request_bh->b_page) {
		if (block_table[blk])
			put_page(block_table[blk]);
		get_page(request_bh->b_page);
		block_table[blk] = request_bh->b_page;
	}
..and only (always) have to copy out for a read.  Trouble is, it could
only work for 4k blocksize.. and is probably pretty gross.
(so off we go to filemap.c..)
What I'd like to do is to set up an address space (still have to figure
out exactly howto.. swap_state.c) and use page cache functions to map
and unmap the incoming data into the ramdisk's address space.  Trouble
is, it looks like a page can only be in one address space.. correct?
Is it possible to use page cache functionality to do correctly what
the above pseudo code tries to accomplish?  If so, a subtle hint (and
maybe a 2x4 to rub it in with) would be much appreciated.
	TIA for any advice,
	-Mike
