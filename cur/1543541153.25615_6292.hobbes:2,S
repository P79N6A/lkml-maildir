Actually, it happens that I had forgotten the last ext3-0.0.2eto0.0.2f
patch on this kernel, so it was using ext3-0.0.2e, which IIRC has a
related bug.
Anyway, the problem no longer appears (in the last 24h, and three hard
resets) on 2.2.17pre15 + (really) ext3-0.0.2f + NFSv3.  Sorry for the
false alarm, and thanks a lot, I won't have to go back to e2fsck, I guess !
