ok, it links and boots ;)
at the previous try, with slab debugging enabled, it was spawning tons
of errors but I suspect it's a bug in the slab debugging, it was
complaining with red zone memory corruption, could be due the tiny size
of this object (only 8 bytes).
andrea@xeon:~> grep anon_vma /proc/slabinfo

now I need to try swapping... (I guess it won't work at the first try,
I'd be surprised if I didn't miss any s/index/private/)
