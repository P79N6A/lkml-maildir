Unfortunately it is a bit more complex, and the truth is less 
complementary to us than what you write.  Reiser4's CPU usage has come 
down a lot, but it still consumes more CPU than V3.  It should consume 
less, and Zam is currently working on making writes more CPU efficient.  
As soon as I get funding from somewhere and can stop worrying about 
money, I will do a complete code review, and CPU usage will go way 
down.  There are always lots of stupid little things that consume a lot 
of CPU that I find whenever I stop chasing money and review code.
We are shipping because CPU usage is not as important as IO efficiency 
for a filesystem, and while Reiser4 is not as fast as it will be in 3-6 
months, it is faster than anything else available so it should be shipped.
