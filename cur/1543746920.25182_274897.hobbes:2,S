That's what I proposed several {months,weeks} ago. From a technical
point of view it seems like a superior solution:
- /usr/include/{linux,asm} -> /usr/src/linux/include/{linux,asm} = no
  problems with kernel and userspace includes.
- while Linux is quite a big program, it is _one_ program = no need to
  patch the whole universe, only the kernel would need changing
  (of course broken userspace code would need fixing, but that's
  due to their brokeness and not due to the change).

No doubt. Still, quite simple automatic operation, we've seen much larger
patches.
API backward-compatibility (including C libs) is IMHO much more
important than just some kernel patch size (I realize ABI compatibility
would be preserved in all cases).
And we can do it anytime - no need for waiting for some libc change,
no need for waiting for "2.7/2.8".

Can't see benefits.
