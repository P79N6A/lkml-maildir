Ah, init ordering.  If it involvles initcalls (I see
./netlink/af_netlink.c:subsys_initcall(netlink_proto_init);),
you can set initcall_debug=1 on the kernel command line to get a
list of initcall addresses dumped into the syslog.
Then you can grep those lines and convert them to names
using
  
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/scripts/cvrt_initcalls
which calls
  
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/scripts/ksysmap
if that will help you any.
