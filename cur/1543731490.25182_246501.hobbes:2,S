Hi Andrew,
in the following mails are the first [1] three patches that convert
  if(foo)
	BUG():
to
  BUG_ON(foo);
This makes the code slightly better readable and it might result in 
slightly better code with recent gcc versions due to the "unlikely" in 
the definition of BUG_ON (it might not be a measurable difference, but  
it comes for free).
Obviosly, in constructs like
  if (foo) {
	printk(KERN_ERR "some error");
	BUG();
  }
or
  switch (foo) {
  case A:
	...
	break;
  case B:
	...
	break;
  default:
	BUG();
  }
BUG() can't be replaced by BUG_ON(), and it's therefore unchanged.
  
cu
Adrian
[1] I plan to send more such patches.
