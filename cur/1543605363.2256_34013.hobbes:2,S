Hello,
HFS (Hierarchical File Sytem, from Apple) formatted CD-ROM used
to mount fine until 2.4.9, and file on them were accessible.
They won't mount anymore in 2.4.10 and 2.4.12. Error messages are:
#####
ll_rw_block: device 0b:00: only 2048-char blocks implemented (512)
hfs_fs: unable to read block 0x00000002 from dev 0b:00
hfs_fs: Unable to read superblock
ll_rw_block: device 0b:00: only 2048-char blocks implemented (512)
hfs_fs: unable to read block 0x00000000 from dev 0b:00
hfs_fs: Unable to read block 0.
#####
Between 2.4.9 and 2.4.10, changes were made to this function
including:

A check then made on correct_size fails with the above error message.
