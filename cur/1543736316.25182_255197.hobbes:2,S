Once upon a midnight dreary, Alan Cox pondered, weak and weary:
> The rest of us just turn on "no overcommit" in /proc/sys.
$ cat /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_{memory,ratio}
0
50
Well that didn't help.
Me thinks the text in Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt may be out of date, 
especially considering it doesn't say the same as 
Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting.txt.
overcommit_memory
-----------------
This file  contains  one  value.  The following algorithm is used to decide if
there's enough  memory:  if  the  value of overcommit_memory is positive, then
there's always  enough  memory. This is a useful feature, since programs often
malloc() huge  amounts  of  memory 'just in case', while they only use a small
part of  it.  Leaving  this value at 0 will lead to the failure of such a huge
malloc(), when in fact the system has enough memory for the program to run.
On the  other  hand,  enabling this feature can cause you to run out of memory
and thrash the system to death, so large and/or important servers will want to
set this value to 0.
And also, I'd like to see how a misbehaving airline passenger could start to 
gain weight not originally on the plane, causing the flight attendants to 
start executing people because of OOF. And IIRC most airlines don't like 
having women onboard who are way too pregnant, so no forking either.
