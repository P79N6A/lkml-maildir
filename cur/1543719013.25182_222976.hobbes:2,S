Dear Linux gurus, 
sorry having to say so: My 2.6.6bk8 test box, with kernel option
nolapic, died a few minutes ago, while printing a couple of pages on a
printer attached to it via USB. Currently, nolapic seems to alleviate,
but not cure the problem.
I'd happily try and do any check you might want to suggest to further
pinpoint the problem.
Best wishes and regards, 
Ernst
