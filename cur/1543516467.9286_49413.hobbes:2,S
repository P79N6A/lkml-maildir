Hi,
Lots of the stuff suggested/discussed sound like Rational's filesystem for
clearcase. If I recall correctly what they do is provide two interfaces for
access 
        1. Non-per user - accessible as a normal mounted fs which are mounted
if the view is active.
        2. Per user which I think is actually cheating the user process by
intercepting functions (this is what the user sees after setting a view with
cleartool).
(My familiarity with CC is mostly at the user level so any gurus please correct
me).
So the suggestion is:
1. Leave the per-user stuff to a pre-load library (and or set of utilities) that
uses some API to the underlying fs to chose exactly what it shows to the user
process.
2. The transparent mounts themselves when mounted as filesystems to are not per
user and they are configurable what they show during the mount operation.

@*** Gallois's Revelation ***
      If you put tomfoolery into a computer, nothing comes out but
      tomfoolery.  But this tomfoolery, having passed through a very
      expensive machine, is somehow ennobled, and no one dares to
      criticize it.
