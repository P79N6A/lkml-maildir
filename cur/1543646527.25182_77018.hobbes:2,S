   With raw ethernet packets, sent from user-space, at around 40Mbps bi-directional,
   I see loads of these messages:
   tg3: eth3: Error, poll already scheduled
This, frankly, isn't possible.
When we get the first interrupt, we hold the spinlock and have IRQs
disabled, in that environment we invoke netif_rx_schedule_prep(dev)
and then disable device interrupts....
is the tg3 sharing it's IRQ with something else?  That might be
an important clue.  In that case what you report might be possible.
Otherwise the message you see appears to be totally impossible.
