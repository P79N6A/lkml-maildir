No, that is, after 23 hours up time it has used only 6 seconds CPU time
(according to top).
That reminds me that I should repeat that my signal 11 problem has (so far)
only caused X to die. The OS remains up and stable.

I suppose I can try this too. My box has a Matrox G400. BTW, what is DRM?
Direct Rendering something?

I'll look into this as well. Anyone have any pointers on how to do this? I
have a Tyan Tiger 133 with Award BIOS if this helps/matters.
Even if this setting does make a difference, what does this tell me/us? I
don't consider running the box with disabled cache(s) a viable solution.
Thanks all and keep those suggestions coming.
