	Well now, thats just brilliant!  You tell everyone to keep
on-topic in this list and what do you do right afterwards?  You
make a snide, belligerent remark about somebody elses country,
that really belongs in "world.us.nato.foreign_policy" or wherever.
	Do the rest of us a favor, Alex, before you open your mouth, make
sure that *YOU* are not offtopic.

	You're guilty of adding noise in the present as well.

	Now look back and read what you wrote and tell me where the
'Respect' is, Alex.
	Look what you made me do.  You got me mad enough to respond in
the list and thus adding even more noise to an already poor S/N
ratio.
