That would be process RSS management you're talking about, which Rik
has bravely volunteered to tackle.  The object would be to respond to
-nice values as sanely as possible, so that a reasonable portion of
those pages touched by the mouse tend to stick around in memory under
all but the highest pressure loads.
Then there is the 'updatedb paged out my desktop in the middle of the
night', related but even harder because of the long timeframe.  To fix
this really well and not kill other, more critical loads requires some
kind of memory of what was paged out when so that when updatedb goes
away, something approximating the former working set pops back in.  A
little low hanging fruit can be gotten by just reading all of swap
back in when the load disappears, which will work fine when swap is
smaller than RAM and there isn't too much shared memory.
