Hans and reiserfs developers,
	the same student of my university
(
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2001-18/0654.html
) was
carrying up the mongo benchmarks against reiser, xfs, jfs and ext2 for
different base sizes.
For example, for the base size of 10.000 (the average of a clean
distribution is about 16.000 bytes) ReiserFS is even slower than ext2. I've
realised the bottleneck may be the CPU, a Cyrix MII 233MHz.
FSYS=ext2 FSYS=reiserfs
(time in sec.)
Create    32.72 / 56.90 = 0.58
Fragm.    1.49 / 2.22 = 0.67
Copy    98.53 / 131.81 = 0.75
Fragm.    1.49 / 2.26 = 0.66
Slinks    4.82 / 5.08 = 0.95
Read    187.90 / 299.23 = 0.63
Stats    1.01 / 0.99 = 1.02
Rename    2.40 / 2.23 = 1.08
Delete    6.55 / 4.82 = 1.36
Can you confirm it? We are going to do the same benchmarks on a PIII if you
think it's due to the cpu.
I don't post the URL of the benchmarks to the list because last time we were
slashdotted ;-) and we aren't convinced they are valueable, but I can send
it to you directly if you are interested.
