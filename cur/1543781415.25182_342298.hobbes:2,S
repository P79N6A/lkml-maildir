No, but I can try that after work today.

There is no fb support at all. I have the vga console,
agp support (which obviously only applies to the agp g550)
drm/dri support for g550 and for the pci radeon.
Could the new patches possibly have issues with the case
where AGP support is compiled into the kernel, but
the card is pci so it isn't supposed to _use_ it?
Also, the two cards aren't used by the same user, it
is two desktops, not one big one.
The X freeze comes fast if I play "cuyo", a nice 2D game
somewhat similiar to tetris. I don't think it
uses DRM, unless x.org 6.8.2 somehow uses it to
speed up 2D operations.
The bisection search:
a46e812620bd7db457ce002544a1a6572c313d8a good
e0b98c79e605f64f263ede53344f283f5e0548be good

ba17101b41977f124948e0a7797fdcbb59e19f3e good
saw lots of drm recompile for the next one:
561fb765b97f287211a2c73a844c5edb12f44f1d bad
6ade43fbbcc3c12f0ddba112351d14d6c82ae476 good
And then the final one also seemed good.
If the stop condition could be off by one,
wonder what the next patch is?
