Fill a test filesystem with data and save it. Corrupt it by copying a
chunk of data from random locations A to B. Save positions A and B so
that you can reproduce the corruption. 
Or corrupt random bits (ideally in metadata blocks) and maintain the
list of the bit numbers for reproducing the corruption.

I see that you are running fsck just once on the test filesystem. It
might be a good idea to run it twice and if second fsck does not find
the filesystem to be completely clean that means it is a bug in fsck.

Also, people may want to test with different mount options, so something
like "mount -t $fstype -o loop,$MOUNT_OPTIONS $imgname $mountpt" may be
useful. Similarly it may also be useful to have MKFS_OPTIONS while
formatting the filesystem.
