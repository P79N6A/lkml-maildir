Better still, propose that a set of different hardware configurations
be benchmarked, with the results being announced for all of them.
Here's some of the combinations I would include:
 1. The cheapest off-the-shelf system available. Round here, that's an
    AMD K6-2/300 with 32M of RAM, a 4.3G hard drive and a 24-speed CD.
 2. The top of the range single processor system available in the same
    store. In this case, a P2/450 with 512M of RAM, dual 32G hard
    drives and a 7-way CD multi-changer.
 3. A hardware specification set by Microsoft, restricted to fall
    between those of the first two.
 4. A hardware specification set by Microsoft, unrestricted.
 5. A hardware specification set by agreement between the senior
    Linux coders, restricted to fall between (1) and (2).
 6. A hardware specification set by agreement between the senior
    Linux coders, unrestricted.
 7. An SMP system, specification set by Microsoft.
 8. An SMP system, specification set by agreement between the senior
    Linux coders.
Best wishes from Riley.
