That's because `pwd' is a bash builtin, and it simply displays the
cached pwd (you just did "cd /tmp/crap2/crap1", so it knows for sure
that's the directory you're in).  To eliminate cached answers, do
"sh -c pwd".

Don't talk to me about solaris.
I just did a lot of digging on a solaris system to find out why "find .
-name bla" always gave the error "find: cannot open .: Permission denied".
   $ id
   uid=2245(mqm) gid=203(mqm)
   $ ls -ld .
   drwxrwxr-x   3 mqm      mqm          512 Feb 22 11:11 .
   $ find . -name bla
   find: cannot open .: Permission denied
   $ pwd
   /var/mqm/log
   $ sh -c pwd
   sh: cannot determine current directory
   $ ls -ld / /var /var/mqm /var/mqm/log
   drwxr-xr-x  40 root     root        1024 Feb 18 16:27 /
   drwxr-xr-x  27 root     root         512 Feb 18 16:35 /var
   drwxrwxr-x  10 mqm      mqm          512 Feb 22 11:11 /var/mqm
   drwxrwxr-x   3 mqm      mqm          512 Feb 22 11:11 /var/mqm/log
The problem was finally tracked down to /var/mqm being mounted on top of
a directory with mode 664.  Make sense?
I just checked, 2.2.15pre7 doesn't say "permission denied" in the same
situation.
