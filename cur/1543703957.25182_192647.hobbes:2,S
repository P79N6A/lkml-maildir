Please make sure you have the latest version of lmsensors.  A few things
have changed in the latest i2c driver code that makes this necessary (we
don't initialize chips from the kernel anymore, which might be what you
are seeing.)
If that still doesn't work, please post this to the sensors mailing list
(address is in the MAINTAINERS file.)
