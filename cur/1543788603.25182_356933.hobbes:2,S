Stupid me, the i810_smbus driver grabbed the device and so the driver core
didn't probe i810fb against it.
With that one out of the way, modprobing i810fb with the appropriate parameters
correctly switches to graphics mode and fbcon gives me a nice console,
with and without Bernhard's patch.
for reference:
modprobe i810fb mode_option=1024x768-8@60 hsync1=40 hsync2=60 vsync1=50 vsync2=70 vram=4
