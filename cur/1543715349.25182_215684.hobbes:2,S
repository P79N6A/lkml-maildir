Not quite. With a SYN you have to respond with exactly the same sequence 
number as attacking host in order to establish connection. With RST, your 
sequence number needs to be +- rwin in order to kill the connection. That 
significantly reduces search space.

No, you do not need to see any packet.

Inter-provider BGP is long-lived with close to fixed ports, which is why 
it has caused quite a stir.
Nevertheless, number of packets to kill the session is still *large* 
(under "best-case" for attacker, you need to send 2^30 packets)...
