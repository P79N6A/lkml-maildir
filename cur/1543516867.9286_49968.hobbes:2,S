In the drivers (kernel-2.2.x) for most of the multiport cards, it seems
like bytes could get dropped when the current flip buffer gets full in
the interrupt handlers especially at high baud rates. Is there already
some code lurking in there which does throttling to avoid this? I feel
otherwise since these drivers would have no prior information regarding
the vacany in the flip buffer other than in the interrupt handler
itself, to stop RX interrupts from occuring . Could something like a
high water mark be implemented for the flip buffers? This would then
definitely require a bigger flip buffer ( greater than 512 bytes),
Would'nt it?

   Another question: if I want to use a larger flip buffer, can I just
   allocate the required memory amount and set the pointers char_buf_ptr
and
   flag_buf_ptr?? If not, I don't see the reason for the existence of
these
   pointers ...
You have to change the routines that set and reset those pointers when
the flip buffers are flipped.  There is a patch outstanding to allow
bigger flip buffers, and I'll hopefully have a chance to look at it over
Thanksgiving weekend.  (My apologies Pavel for my delay in looking over
your patch; I've been swamped lately.)
