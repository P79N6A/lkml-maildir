How about if you educate me on the problems you see for a bit before I 
respond? I think it might help us move into a constructive discussion.
You are more experienced with your code than I am.... but I firmly 
believe that having different views of the same filesystem in which some 
files are visible in one view but not in another is technically feasible 
for some VFS, though I'd like to learn about the problems you see for 
doing it in the current VFS.
