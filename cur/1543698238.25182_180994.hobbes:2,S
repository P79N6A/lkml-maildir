Marcelo,
We (Fermilab) second this request.  We won't be touching 2.6 until it's 
really stable (read as, Red Hat comes out with an official distro that has 
it built in), and we already have *a lot* of XFS filesystems here (~>300TB) 
running on 2.4 kernels.  It would be very, very nice to have it in the 2.4 
tree without having to pull it from SGI.
Thanks,
Dan
