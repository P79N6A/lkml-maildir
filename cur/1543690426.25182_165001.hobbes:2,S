If you set the "perm" portion of the module_param() macro to 0, then the
sysfs file will not be created.  That will cause all of the old modules
that use the MODULE_PARAM() macro to not have things change for them, as
they will not be expecting it.
To quote from include/linux/moduleparam.h:
/* This is the fundamental function for registering boot/module
   parameters.  perm sets the visibility in driverfs: 000 means it's
   not there, read bits mean it's readable, write bits mean it's
   writable. */
Sound ok with you?
