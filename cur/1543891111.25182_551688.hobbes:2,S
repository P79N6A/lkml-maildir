Yes, that's much better. I will leave the profile_hit as a simple call
to profile hits with one parameter for now, although it might be a
little bit useless. Being able to select independently which specific
site must be enabled is interesting too, therefore I will use the more
precise "sched_profiling" to replace "profile_on".
I guess we could also rework profile.c:profile_tick() in the same way,
using "cpu_profiling". It would be interesting to wrap the whole
profile_tick() call in a cond_call, but it would involve dealing with
more than one different things that are part of this function and can
have to run. The same will apply to kvm and sleep profiling.
