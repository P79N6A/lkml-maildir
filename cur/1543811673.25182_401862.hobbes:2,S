During the last week my workstation at the office was upgraded.  I
haven't been able to reproduce the freeze on the new box after
uploading a few 600MB ISO images.  This certainly would've tripped the
old machine, but this one seems fine.
Similar kernel version, 2.6.15-1-686-smp from Debian etch.  The
possible major difference is that the old box wasn't SMP, the new one
is.
Sorry, not much help!
