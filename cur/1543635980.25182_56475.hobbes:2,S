   Since there's no official sparc32 maintainer, I'm sending this patch
   directly to you. It has now been tested in various configurations
   (released in the default Aurora 0.3 kernel) and appears to be causing
   no undesired side effects.
I'm still reviewing the patch and it is in my backlog AND I was on a
12 day vacation.  Be patient and I didn't want this in until 2.4.20
anyways, thanks.
