This is one of the things that was talked about (and agreed upon) at the
last developers' meeting. First priority was to make one version that
would work on all the kernel versions (to prevent the different trees
getting out of sync). That's been done now; the next step is getting the
current state into the kernel :-)  Once that's been done, I'm guessing
the "stable" and "unstable" trees will be created (when Fritz Elfert
gets the time...).

I think that would be great. I hope Karsten Keil will have time soon to
respond to you himself; he's the one which which such things should be
coordinated IMHO.
