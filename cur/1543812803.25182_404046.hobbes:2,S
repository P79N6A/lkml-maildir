Yes, the do-we-need-another-thread algorithm is rather too naive.  I could
swear it _used_ to work OK.  Maybe something changed to cause individual
threads to block for longer than they used to.  That would be an
independent problem - one pdflush instance is supposed to be able to handle
many queues (I tested one instance on 12 disks and it worked OK.  But that
was 4-5 years ago)

It would be better to not start a new thread in the first place.
