These are some benchmarks on a 16-way (4x4) NUMAQ. Basically
measures the scheduler patches with a couple of meaningless
but very scheduler intensive benchmarks.
hackbench:
The number in () is a projection for the time 1000 would take,
assuming a linear scaling. It is probably better shown on a
graph, but you can see a non linear element in 2.6.4 that is
basically absent in 2.6.4-mm1.

500     262.0 (524)  181.7 (363)
volanomark (MPS):
This one starts getting huge mmap_sem contention at 150+ coming
from futexes. Don't know what is taking the mmap_sem for writing.
Maybe just brk or mmap.
