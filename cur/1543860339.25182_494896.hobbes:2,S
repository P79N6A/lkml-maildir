I like new design much more than my previous kevent based approach and
existing repeated call approach. I plan to start working on it jst after
New Year vacations are over (in about a week or two, it is the longest
vacations of the year in Russia, which are spent in a way which does not 
allow to hack or perform any other usefull work).
Kevent AIO was completely different thing than Suparna's AIO, and
although it hooked into block/fs subsystem on a bit different layer (I
exported ->get_block() callback), it was possible to fully separate AIO
from main code.

Yes, indeed.

Network AIO should not be different from block IO - it is essentially
the same mechanisms, which just have different lower layer from where
callbacks are invoked.

Yes, async IO is a significant part, and will be implemented, IMHO, new
design I highlighted in linux-fsdevel@ in AIO related thread is the way
to go (at least I will imlement it that way).
