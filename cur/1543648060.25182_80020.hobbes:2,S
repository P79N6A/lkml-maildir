The diffstat I sent in the email was generated by bk-make-sum, which because
it was across several changesets somehow got the math wrong.  Diffstat of
the accompanying patch (generated from bk treediff of the two trees) shows:
 Config.help             |  222 ---------------
 watchdog/Config.help    |  220 +++++++++++++++
which I'd believe to be correct.
Thanks,
Matt
