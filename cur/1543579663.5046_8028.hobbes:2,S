I have a tendency to use class_functionName() where "class" represents a
class of related functions.  They all tend to take a point to an instance
of that "class".  So then you can read the code and see the "classes" in
the names.
And, this way, I can piss off both the anti underscore and the anti mixed case
people at the same time :-)
