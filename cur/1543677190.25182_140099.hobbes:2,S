hmm, that is clever. But I am afraid it will not work: the master (the
touchpad) must be told how many bytes the guest protocol uses. So it can
not just sent the bytes back and forth. If set wrong the guest is ignored.
(This was probably what was happening a while back when many reported that
the stick did not work: probing for imps2, exps2 etc. is forwarded to the
guest and if the guest knew fx. imps2 it switch protocol, but the master
was not told and ignored the guest)
