You are wrong. They are the same value (this is required by the ISO C
standard), i.e. both NULL == (void *) 0 and NULL == 0 must be true.

Again, you are wrong. The goal of malloc is to reserve memory.
This can be seen as used memory. If the implementation behaves
differently, then it is broken.

The quotas are set properly (i.e. there are no quotas).
