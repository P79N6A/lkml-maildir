Surely the kernel can allocate pagable memory if it chooses to?  I think 
in the case of pktcdvd it would be best for the buffers to be pagable 
when initially allocated and filled, and only locked into memory when 
the bio is sent down to the cdrom driver.  That way you could keep a 
fairly large number of buffers on larger ( 256 KB+ ) packets in memory 
for write combining, without placing undue burden on non paged pool.
