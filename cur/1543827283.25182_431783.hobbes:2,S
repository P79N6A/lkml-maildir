Alex is off by an order of magnitude.  I've re-read the 13-patch series, 
and this is the result of the review:
There are _five_ "if (new) .. else .." constructs added in JBD alone.
Three added in extent map support.
Twenty-seven (27) such constructs in 48-bit physical block support.
Two more in 48-bit ACL support.
And finally, the superblock changes don't add any branches, like the 
other code does, but it does double the endian conversion work that 
-every- user must do, even if they don't use 48bit at all.
