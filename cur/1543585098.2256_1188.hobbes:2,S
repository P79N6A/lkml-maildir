The page table spinlock should be quite sufficient to let us avoid
races in the page fault code.  We've had to deal with this before
there was ever a mmap_sem anyway: in ancient times, every page fault
had to do things like check to see if the pte had changed after IO was
complete and once the BKL had been retaken.  We can do the same with
the page fault spinlock without much pain.

Definitely.

Why do we need another lock?  The critical section where we do the
final update on the pte _already_ takes the page table spinlock to
avoid races against the swapper.
