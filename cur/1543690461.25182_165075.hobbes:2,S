OK will try... but how test it... sounds not easy.

Well, the program is using more than 2Go ram... the core is not written to
disk as the machine hangs just *after*
And this is a remote machine in a Datacenter.

NULL for example ?
Typical example of code ;
T_cell *ptr, *next ;
for (ptr = list.head ; ptr != NULL ; ptr = next) {
   next = ptr->next ;
   prefetch(next) ;
   some_work(ptr) ;
   }
I may replace NULL by &FakeMappedData   (allways present in memory)

This is not a kernel crash. But total freeze as all memory is used by
network buffers, in no more than 10 seconds.
This application receive smalls TCP messages (about 30 bytes), but the
network stacks allocates 4KB buffers to store this little messages.
No oops, but what can we do, if the freeze lasts eternity ?
I posted a test application some days ago about this problem and got no
answers/feedback.
