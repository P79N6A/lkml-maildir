Yep, and that are exactly the reasons we wanted to use
/proc/mounts instead of /etc/mtab in the first place:
on our Diskless Client we have the root fs mounted readonly 
(NFS mount) :-)
Now we want to use it on "normal" systems, too, and so we 
came across the other problems (like missing quota flags)
