Yes. And my point was all the other occurences. Specifically those in 
*.c files. Btw. Not everything in the /usr/include/* path is part of 
the compiler. For instance, the network definitions are *not* part, nor 
  are the syscall interface or any filesystem code.

Agreed, and i'll probably won't have much time for that the coming five 
weeks. So don't hold
your breath. However, it would be a good thing if someone (or 
preferably, more than one) would
endeavour to do this.

Well... Someone's got to do it, and "millions" seems to be a bit

I think it's worth the efforts of more than just a single individual.

I've checked those files, but the use of compiler specific tricks seems 
a bit more widespread
than that.

My local electronics shop. I brought it up just to make the point the 
kernel is *not* part of the compilers implementation, since the 
compiler will work happily without it.
> I _only_ care about what symbols Linux can use,
Ok. However, the gcc-crowd may see that in a completely different 
perspective. For them the linux kernel is just one application and 
linux (as a platform) just one platform they support.

As i've said, I don't care what you are running, OS is *never* part of 
the compiler. At most some interfaces
are in a fuzzy, roundabout way. And even that is a questionable 
practice.

Just to make the bloody point GCC is not dependent on Linux in any way 
and hence the kernel is *not* part of GCC.

No... A binary compiled for one platform will not run on another, 
usually. This still does not imply the linux kernel is part of gcc.

Weird. How come i'm running XFree86 and the Gimp on MacOSX? There ain't 
no linux in sight.

Monitoring water levels and sending out alarm messages (by SMS) when 
the level either
gets too low or too high. Furthermore it controls a "stuw", a device 
for regulating
the waterlevel for which I do not know the english term.

What kernel? What pages? What OS? There is no OS, just a set of library 
functions
i developed (pretty much) myself.

What files? I write to EEPROM directly. There is no filesystem. Hell 
there isn't even a vfprintf. In case you are wondering, it's an 
application for the Atmel ATMega I mentioned.

Allocate MORE MEMORY? The 4 kb available is full enough as it is.

And for that reason, not part of the implementation. The library (glibc 
in your case) handles (or rather, should handle) the trickery involved. 
But glibc isn't part of gcc.

Agreed. That why i said "minimal" instead of "absent". Personally I 
think the compilers interfaces are pretty good.

The way other libraries handle it. That ain't magic. The thing that 
strikes me in the file you
mention is that both versions (__u32 *and* u32) are used in parts of 
the header that are
(judging by #ifdef __KERNEL__) internal to the kernel.
This implies that merely stripping the double underscore may suffice. 
After all, that is code that will never be part of the 
C-Implementation.

Either stdint.h becomes part of the kernel, which implies your 
redefined versions in old source are up to some maintainance, or we 
rely on the asm/types.h versions and use them consistently. In either 
case, use of double underscores where none are required, is not good. 
Nor is redefining stuff that's defined by gcc, or worse ISO.

Used, yes. Defined, no. The stuff the compiler headers define *without* 
double underscores is the stuff that is exported for users to use. The 
stuff that *has* double underscores isn't.
