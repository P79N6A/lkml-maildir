Thanks.   I know about that one and have a patch about to be posted
which should fix it.  But I don't completely understand it.
When a raid5 array shuts down, it clears mddev->private, but doesn't
clean q->backing_dev_info.congested_fn.  So if someone tries to call
that congested_fn, it will try to dereference mddev->private and Oops.
Only by the time that raid5 is shutting down, no-one should have a
reference to the device any more, and no-one should be in a position
to call congested_fn !!
Maybe pdflush is just trying to sync the block device, even though
there is no dirty date .... dunno....
But I don't think it is related to the cfq problem as this one is only
a problem when the array is being stopped.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
