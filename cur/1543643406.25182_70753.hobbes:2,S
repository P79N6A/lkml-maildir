Hmm, I just plopped in a 20267 here and it works perfectly:
PDC20267: IDE controller at PCI slot 00:0c.0
PDC20267: chipset revision 2
PDC20267: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
PDC20267: (U)DMA Burst Bit ENABLED Primary PCI Mode Secondary PCI Mode.

    ide3: BM-DMA at 0xa008-0xa00f, BIOS settings: hdg:pio, hdh:DMA
hde: IBM-DTLA-307030, ATA DISK drive
ide2 at 0xb400-0xb407,0xb002 on irq 16

Can you please send me the config settings?
