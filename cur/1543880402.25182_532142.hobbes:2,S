Here is how it should work.
CONFIG_ACPI and CONFIG_APM should both available in a kernel build.
However, at boot time, of ACPI is active, then APM should be disabled.
The pm_active flag used to handle this, but that method was BROKEN
when the CONFIG_PM_LEGACY #define was added.  Today, there are systems
(such as the Thinkpad T30) that will not boot if CONFIG_PM_LEGACY
is not defined.  The reason nobody is complaining is because the distros
are currently defining CONFIG_PM_LEGACY.  But when you nuke that option
and everything under it, this bug will be exposed and some systems will stop booting.
