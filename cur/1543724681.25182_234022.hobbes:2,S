How can free blocks have an owner?  They wouldn't be free then.

You do, some fs' will return stale data.

No, it's not hard to fix the applications and it's easy to tell if
they are fixed.

You don't fix all applications, only ones where data is critical and
their handling of it is poor.  MTAs like postfix don't have a problem
for example, they are generally written well.

ext3 and reiserfs have what amounts to this as an option right now.
It has some performance implications but I'm told works great.
I don't think the current XFS behaviour is undesirable or broken.
