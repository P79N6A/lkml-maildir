So, let's say that CVS is the "preferred form" of the Linux kernel source
code, because it is freely available.  If BK has everything in it that CVS
does, and also information that is not even POSSIBLE to store in CVS (i.e.
ChangeSet information which links a bunch of individual file changes and
comments into a single change entity) what happens then?  If you had never
put the kernel into BK, that information wouldn't exist at all, yet it is
not possible to extract it without resorting to some source-of-all-evil
tool like BK (I hope everyone reading here understands the sarcasm, but the
fact that I have to annotate it makes me believe some people will not).
The fact that BK is used creates information which WOULD NOT HAVE EXISTED
had BK not existed.  In fact, until BK was in use by Linus, not even basic
CVS checkin comments existed, so the metadata was in a format called
linux-kernel mbox (if that).  So, the use of a tool like BK makes more data
available, but people cannot be worse off than when the kernel was shipped
as a tarball and periodic patches.  For the sake of those people who don't
or can't use BK, just pretend BK doesn't exist and they will not be any
worse off than a year ago.

Sure, except BK isn't a proprietary file format (see GNU CSSC and or some
Perl scripts reported on this list), so the issue is purely hypothetical.
