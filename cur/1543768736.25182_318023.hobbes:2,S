In this case the time to complete the task is reduced by 18%, so the 
delay is definately excessive.  That 18% is remarkably close to the 
19.5% hit for __delay in the profile results.

The patch only enables it on one variant of ICH6 SATA so far.

Have you a better suggestion for blacklisting devices?

This option is undesirable for hardware which behaves correctly.  The 
vast majority of users aren't going to be fiddling with hdparm options
(I certainly don't want to see modern SATA being a repeat of the magic 
handwaving the IDE driver and DMA went through for years).
At the very least the option should be introduced and new drivers should 
start life without these legacy delays in place.  If doing it on a per 
port interface isn't good enough, what is?  Globally seems worse to me 
as then any system with a mix of old and new hardware isn't going to do 
the right thing.
