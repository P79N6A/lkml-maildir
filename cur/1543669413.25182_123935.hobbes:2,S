I found the binaries (
ftp://people.redhat.com/drepper/glibc/2.3.1-25/
)
but the sources don't seem to be available.  (That makes it hard to
test, since my 2.5 system is running debian..)
Preferable would be a patch against the standard 2.3.1 (rather than one
against the redhat sources) but I can probably detangle it if needed.
Also, has this been tested under SMP or am I forging new ground? (dual
ppro 200 system under 2.5.66-bk10.)
