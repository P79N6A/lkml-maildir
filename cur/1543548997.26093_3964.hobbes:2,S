It was intentional. Writing to this file hasn't worked well
since 2.3.50 or so, when the zoned VM was merged.
Also, the fact that the new VM keeps a list of directly
reclaimable inactive pages around that varies according
to the amount of VM activity should make tweaking this
value no longer needed...

Rik
