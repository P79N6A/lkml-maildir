Also the prevention of running modified versions is not only caused by
economic interests and business models. There are also scenarios where
it is simply necessary:
- The liability for damages, where the manufacturer of a device might
be responsible in case of damage when he abandoned the prevention. This
applies to medical devices as well as to lasers, machine tools and many
more. Device manufacturers can not necessarily escape such liabilities
as it might be considered grossly negligent to hand out the prevention
key, even if the user signed an exemption from liability.
- Regulations to prevent unauthorized access to radio frequencies, which
is what concerns e.g. cellphone manufacturers.
- ...
An ultimate definition of acceptable and unacceptable usage scenarios is
simply not possible due to the complexity of the problem. Any attempt to
create a definition will lead to loopholes and grey areas. Further it
will compulsory exclude acceptable usage scenarios.
A simple loophole example was brought up in the discussion already:
Technical limitations which do not allow modification at all, e.g. ROMs,
ASICs are apparently considered as a valid usage scenario, but it also
allows in consequence the circumvention of the intended lock down
protection by simple technical means, e.g. ROM based software
cartridges.
If you knit narrower meshes, you create more holes. This is not only
true for knitgoods, it's also a well known problem of legal systems.
