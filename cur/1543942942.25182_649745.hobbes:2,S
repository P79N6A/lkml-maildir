What are you talking about? That's what every GPL-licensed library
does. By putting a library under the GPL, the copyright-holder clearly
states that he considers all programs that link against that library a
derived work. And that he therefor requires these programs to be GPL,
too, no matter if these programs already exist or not.
The LGPL exists to allow the linked program to be non-GPL, remember?
But the kernel is GPL, and not LGPL. And all these arguments that a
kernel module does not "link" against the kernel code, is therefor not
a derived work, and not bound by the GPL's restrictions, is just
artificial nonsense.

No. The GPL is about derived work. Derived code can obviously only
appear _after_ the original work.

Nice to hear. So, if you're an advocate for open source drivers, why do
you have problems making them GPL?

Using a symbol from a library means linking to it, and that creates a
derived work. Why should it be different when using kernel symbols?
Thanks,
