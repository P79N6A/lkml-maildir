The overall situation is not great, but I think I prefer this, or
something like this, to the ifdef.
I'm tempted to say we should add a per-driver function that calls BUG()
instead of a generic function which calls panic(), though.  That will be
a bit more informative to users.  For the case where the real
xxx_remove_one is dropped, it is a kernel bug if that code is -ever-
called...
