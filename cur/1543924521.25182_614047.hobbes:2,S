Hmm. The original Linux code did
	movw    $1, %ax
	lmsw    %ax
	jmp     flush_instr
    flush_instr:
and I think that was straigh out of the documentation. So yeah, I think 
that's the right fix - not a longjmp (which in itself is dangerous: it 
potentially behaves *differently* on different CPU's, since some CPU's may 
do the long jump with pre-protected-mode semantics, while others will do 
it with protected mode already in effect!)
