Absolutely all free memory may be used for disk caching.  So
no, you can't get a bigger cache because it is already at
the highest possible setting.  You don't have more memory
for this - all is used already.

This is exactly what you should expect with lots of cache:
You run a big untar.
This is written straight to the disk cache RAM, that's why
it finishes very fast.  Because it isn't really on disk - 
it is in the cache.  
You may go on doing other work, the tar is over.  But the
data have to get to disk too, not only the cache.  That's
the rumbling you notice - stuff being written from cache
onto the disk itself.

It isn't decompressing, merely writing.  All decompressing etc.
that "tar" does is done - but the stuff went into your (big)
disk cache.  What you hear is the uncompressed stuff being
written from cache to disk.
Of course the files are instantly useable even when they aren't yet
written to disk.  This because you actually get stuff from the cache,
never from the disk itself.

It always worked this way.  Forever.

Synchronously mounted then.  Worse performance, but safer if you
have the bad habit of turning the machine off when you
_believe_ it is finished.
You can force this behaviour under linux too - use
"sync" to force synchronization when you feel you need it.
Or mount syncrhonously - but then you take a performance
hit all the time.

Some disk systems are cpu intensive. SCSI (or properly
tuned IDE using (u)dma and irq unmasking) is much better.
