    Sigh, I had no chance to test the driver on this chip myself... And I also
haven't tried the driver on SATA drives at all... :-/

    I'm surprised that this has even compiled! It has check_in_drive_lists() 
defined twice...

    You may find the summary patch in the -mm tree I guess if you hit the V 
link against the -mm patch at the top of www.kernel.org page, like this one:

    Hm, looks like the drive is wrongly reported as blacklisted or the cable 
being somehow misdetected... Ah, this was SATA drive, you say?

    I also would, at least UDMA(100)... :-)

    Output of hdparm -iI /dev/hde would also be helpful.

    Well, this looks sane...
