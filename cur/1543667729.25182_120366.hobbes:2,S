If your boxes range from PII through to AMD duron build for 686, but the
basic theory is the same.
A 386 kernel really hurts later CPUs
A 486 kernel is generally fine
A 686 kernel speeds stuff up a little more
The only CPU that is really helped by a custom kernel is the rather rare
IDT winchip which is 10-30% faster with the right kernels
