But... But with AFFS you _have_ exclusion between block-allocation and
truncate(). It has no sparse files, so pageout will never allocate
anything. I.e. all allocations come from write(2). And both write(2) and
truncate(2) hold i_sem.
Problem with AFFS is on the directory side of that business and there it's
really scary. Block allocation is trivial...
