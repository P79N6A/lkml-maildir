   I thought the answer was no, so I double checked with a couple of
   hardware guys, and the answer is still no.
Sigh...
So Anton, when the PCI controller gets a set of sub-cacheline word
reads from the device, it reads the value from memory once for every
one of those words?  ROFL, if so...  I can't believe they wouldn't
put caches on the PCI controller for this, at least a one-behind that
snoops the bus :(
