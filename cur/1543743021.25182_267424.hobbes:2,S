Patch is fine except that I would add a sysctl to enable/disable this.
I can see that some people would like to not have interleave policy
(e.g. when you use tmpfs as a large memory extender on 32bit NUMA
then you probably want local affinity) 
Best if you name it /proc/sys/vm/numa-tmpfs-rr
Default can be set to one for now.
