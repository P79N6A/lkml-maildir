Yes sure, this change shoud be tested in -mm tree (I'll send the patch
on Sunday after some testing). The only (afaics) problem is that with
this change a kernel thread must not do do_fork(CLONE_THREAD). I think
it should not, but currently this is technically possible. Perhaps it
makes sense to add BUG_ON(CLONE_THREAD && group_leader->exit_signal==-1)
in copy_process().
On a related note,
	zap_other_threads:
		if (t != p->group_leader)
			t->exit_signal = -1;
looks like another leftover to me, we already depend on the fact that
all sub-threads have ->exit_signal == -1 (otherwise, for example, a
thread group just can't exit properly).
While we are talking about kernel threads, there is something I can't
undestand. kthread/daemonize use sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK) to protect
against signals. This doesn't look right to me, because this doesn't
prevent the signal delivery, this only blocks signal_wake_up(). Every
"killall -33 khelper" means a "struct siginfo" leak.
Imho, the kernel thread shouldn't play with ->blocked at all. Instead
it should set SIG_IGN for all handlers. If it really needs, say, SIGCHLD,
it should call allow_signal() anyway. Do you see any problems with this
approach?
Oleg.
