I can't see it helping *that* much, for me I have:
    charon:~/wk/linux% size 2.4.x-cw/vmlinux bk-2.5.x/vmlinux
       text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    2003887  120260  191657 2315804  23561c 2.4.x-cw/vmlinux
    2411323  267551  181004 2859878  2ba366 bk-2.5.x/vmlinux
    gcc version 2.95.4 20011002 (Debian prerelease)
this is for functionally (in terms of .config) equivalent kernels.
