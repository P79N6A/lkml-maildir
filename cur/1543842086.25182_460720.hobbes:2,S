Sort of, we actually inherited that type from IRIX where it is
defined in <sys/types.h>.

Nah, I just don't see the value either way, and see it as another
code churn exercise.

Personally, no.  Thats code churn with no value IMO.

Well, that would be named "flushcount" or some such thing.  And you
would be able to tell that it was a counter by the way its used in
the surrounding code.
This discussion really isn't going anywhere useful; I think you need
to accept that not everyone sees value in a boolean type. :)
