I've seen this when I was first looking into the input stuff recently.
I think it was caused by the keyboard getting confused after I was
testing the data and clock lines on the interface.
One fix I came up with (and discarded) was to try to reset the keyboard
3 times, and only fail if it failed all 3 times.  The other fix (the one
I ended up using) doesn't make sense to i8042 keyboard controllers.
