Hi.
I want to fix the userspace noflushd daemon to run on 2.5 kernels,
but it seems to get *very* tricky, because bdflush, kupdated have been
replaced by pdflush.
I've grepped through the lkml-archives and I found a post from you, Andrew,
that sayed:
[SNIP]
Subject: [patch] replace kupdate and bdflush with pdflush
- - use a timer to kick off a pdflush thread every five seconds
  to run the kupdate code. 
- - wakeup_bdflush() kicks off a pdflush thread to run the current
  bdflush function.
There's some loss of functionality here - the ability to tune
the writeback periods.  The numbers are hardwired at present.
But the intent is that buffer-based writeback disappears
altogether.  New mechanisms for tuning the writeback will
need to be introduced.
[SNIP]
Yea, but it seems, that I need exactly this lost functionality. :)
noflushd, on 2.4 kernels, prevents the disks to spin up by spinning
them down an stopping the kupdated daemon through putting
the update-interval to 0 via syscall bdflush().
That's the code to do so:
bdflush(2 + (1 << 3) + 1, interval);
So, how to set the interval, or better sayed, how to _stop_
buffer flushing in 2.5?
Has this lost functionality already been re-implemented?
Are there new syscalls?
Thanks for your help.
