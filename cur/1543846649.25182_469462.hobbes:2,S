Well, it happened on both of the new machines we got last week. One

There's no such message in the log. The preceeding lines are just normal
startup messages:
	Adding 16779852k swap on /dev/sda1.  Priority:42 extents:1 across:16779852k
	Adding 16779852k swap on /dev/sdb1.  Priority:42 extents:1 across:16779852k
	process `syslogd' is using obsolete setsockopt SO_BSDCOMPAT
