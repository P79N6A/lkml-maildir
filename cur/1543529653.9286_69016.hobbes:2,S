   Unless it slipped my notice, netfilter isn't merged yet, is it? I think
   this task should definitely be listed. It's a pretty vital part...
It's included in the "Merge networking bits (davem)" entry.
Actually, all of the core netfilter support is merged.
The only thing left are the modules themselves, and
that should be as simple as adding a new driver so in
theory it could even occur during 2.4.x if needed.
Later,
