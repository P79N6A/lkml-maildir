I wonder if most of the critical DSP cycle fits in the cache?
Does it degrade significantly with a compile running in the background?

Outstanding.  
How do you get rid of that checkerboard grey background in the graphs?
Looking at the graphs, your system has a substantial 4 to 6 msec delay
on approximately 40 second intervals, regardless of which scheduling
class or how many clients you run.  I'm guessing this is a recurring
long code path in the kernel and not a scheduling artifact at all.
