I'd love to. However 2.4.27-pre2 broke the tg3 driver. tg3.c contains 
WARN_ON(1). Sadly, WARN_ON doesn't exist in 2.4.x, so depmod correctly 
complains about an unresolved symbol.
I'm beginning to wonder if anyone actually builds these pre releases... I 
mean, I know the tg3 driver is really obscure, and only used by 2 people, 
but...
