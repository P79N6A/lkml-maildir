good point.
The clean solution would be to make PIT_TICK_RATE/CLOCK_TICK_RATE a 
variable that defaults to 1193182 on x86, and which an early quirk would 
set to 1189200 on AMD Elan and to 1041667 on RDC321X.
likewise, other subarch details should be turned into specific drivers 
or specific quirks as well.
