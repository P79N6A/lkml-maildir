Hardware faults such as memory corruption (leading to software malfunction)

Exactly.

I think that's a bad example - you would start httpd from init if it was that
critical, or use a monitoring system, or something...  Spontaneously booting
the machine because the admin made an error in httpd.conf seems a little
impractical  :)   Especially because it will keep on re-booting, until someone
starts it in single-user mode and fixes the httpd config...

A very nice document !   Some day, someone ought to standardize the way
that /dev/watchdog is used...  Some other day I presume   :)
