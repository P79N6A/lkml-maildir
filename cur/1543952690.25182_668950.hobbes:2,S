Thanks for the comments.
In the meantime I had an IRC chat with Ben, who wanted a couple of quite
substantial changes to be made to this patch.
First, Ben thinks that ->prepare() should be called in a separate loop for
all devices, before any of them is suspended, so that drivers can assume the
availability of the other devices during ->prepare() (for example, so that they
can use GFP_KERNEL memory allocations).  Accordingly, ->complete() would
be called in a separate loop after calling ->resume() for all devices.
Next, he wants the number of noirq callbacks to be reduced.
Both of the above things make sense, so I'll rework the patch (or maybe even
all three patches) to implement them and we'll see how they will look like.
Thanks,
Rafael
