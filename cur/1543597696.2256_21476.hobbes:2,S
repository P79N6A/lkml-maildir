I'm running a SMP (2xPIII 600) on a Tyan Tiger mobo (Via Apollo Pro 133a
chipset) with a G400 and it runs fine, when I do the following:
	- disable APIC ("noapic" as a boot parameter).  Then again, the
	  system won't boot without APIC disabled.
	- use the ALSA drivers for my SoundBlaster Live.  (I haven't
	  tried the kernel-based drivers for a few version now, so this
	  situation might have changes, but up until I switched to ALSA,
	  I had crashes all the time during medium to high I/O.
	- use the uhci USB driver when I'm using a USB printer.  If I
	  use the usb-uhci driver with my USB printer, the whole system
	  locks.  This has been reported a few times on LKML,
	  linux-usb-users, and linux-usb-developers and nobody helped,
	  but a few people wrote back with "me too"s.  It was broken in
	  the trasnition from 2.4.3 to 2.4.4 and only seems to affect
	  SMP systems.  I just gave up on USB printing and went back to
	  my parallel port.
Finally, I'm using RedHat 7.1.  This system has no stability problems
now (after a long series of all kinds of stability problems).  Maybe
it's a load thing, I don't know, but it now runs stable.
