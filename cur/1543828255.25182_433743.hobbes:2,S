Scheduling contexts do sound useful.  They're easily defeated though, as
evolution mail demonstrates to me every time it's GUI hangs and I see
that a nice 19 find is running, eating very little CPU, but effectively
DoSing evolution nonetheless (journal).  I wonder how often people who
tried to distribute CPU would likewise be stymied by other resources.
