Oops, I forgot about store-store ordering being automatic.
Pretend I had some loads in my example.
A proper interface would be more explicit about what the
fence does, so that driver authors shouldn't need to know
this detail.

OK, a different discussion... though memory being used
for DMA seems rather related. You need to flush before
a DMA out, or invalidate before a DMA in.

So you say: never mix strict mappings with loose operations,
and never mix loose mappings with strict operations.
That is an excellent rule. I see no need to stop people from
actively trying to shoot their feet though. I'm certainly not
suggesting that people be mixing things.
For some CPUs, you want to be specifying things when you
set up the mapping. For other CPUs, the read/write code is
how this gets determined. So developers specify both.
