Just an useful side effect. 5% reserve was introduced for performance
reasons, i believe.
The root FS can be filled with *root* data, too. That's why syslogd writes
to /var/log. 5% reserve is not a great idea to avoid FS full. It helps
sometimes. No user processes should be allowed to write on the root FS,
anyway (yes, I hate /tmp, and /var/tmp, too).
