Subject: [patch 00/26] Xen-paravirt_ops: Xen guest implementation for paravirt_ops interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andi,
This patch series implements the Linux Xen guest as a paravirt_ops
backend.  The features in implemented this patch series are:
 * domU only
 * UP only (most code is SMP-safe, but there's no way to create a new vcpu)
 * writable pagetables, with late pinning/early unpinning
   (no shadow pagetable support)
 * supports both PAE and non-PAE modes
 * xen hvc console (console=hvc0)
 * virtual block device (blockfront)
 * virtual network device (netfront)
The patch series is in three parts:
  1-2	Cleanup patches to various parts of the kernel
  3-15	Extensions to the core code and/or paravirt ops, needed to support
	Xen. Includes hooks into get/setting pte values and the new
	patching machinery.
 16-26	The Xen paravirt_ops implementation itself.
(Some of the earlier patches in the series have already been posted,
 but are included to make the series self-contained.)
I've tried to make each patch as self-explanatory as possible.  The
series is based on 2.6.21-rc2-git1.
Changes since the previous posting:
- Moved the arch_*_mmap stubs to asm-generic/mm_hooks.h, and included that in
  asm-*/mmu_context.h (James Bottomley)
- Use unsigned long consistently for addresses (Andi Kleen)
- Moved xenboot_console declaration to its own header. (Andi Kleen)
- Renamed FIX_PARAVIRT to FIX_PARAVIRT_BOOTMAP to emphasize that its intended
  for bootstrap only (Ingo Molnar)
- Cleaned up headers a fair bit.  Moved a lot of the native_*
  functions to their "home" headers, so that they can be used either for
  native paravirt boots, or when CONFIG_PARAVIRT is disabled.  This cuts
  down on duplication, and makes paravirt.h simpler.
- Various cleanups from Adrian Bunk
Thanks,
	J
