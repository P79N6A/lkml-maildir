Looks like the idle time issue is still biting for those guys.
Hmm, maybe MySQL is actually _touching_ the memory inside a more
critical lock, so the faults get tangled up on mmap_sem there. I
wonder if making malloc call memset right afterwards would hide
that ;) Or the madvise exclusive mmap_sem avoidance.
Seems like with perfect scaling we should get to the 2400 mark.
It would be nice to be able to not degrade under load. Of course
some of that will be MySQL scaling issues.
