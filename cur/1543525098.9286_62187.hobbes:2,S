Sorry if this has been caught by someone else, but I got this:
Feb  9 19:26:36 cyberelk identd[3285]: Connection from imailg2.svr.pol.co.uk
Feb  9 19:26:36 cyberelk kernel: gfp called by non-running (1) task from c0119cda!
Feb  9 19:26:36 cyberelk identd[3285]: from: 195.92.195.180 ( imailg2.svr.pol.co.uk ) for: 1075, 25
c0119cac t do_anonymous_page
c0119d30 t do_no_page
I get a gfp message for each identd action.
Tim.
