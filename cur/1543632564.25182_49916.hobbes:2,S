Item 4 is already done in my tree. As I said before the patch you sent
me a while back did not apply and appeared to be for an old 2.4.17/8
tree. I never got an update beyond that so I had assumed the problem had
already been resolved.
Andre - want to go over the rest and send me the bits ? Or Hank do you
want to send me a patch versus 2.4.19pre to fix those bugs
