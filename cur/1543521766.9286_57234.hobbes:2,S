Such sockets should not have users and associated files --- nothing to close.
If they do have, the service generating (apache?) them is _seriously_
broken. At least, stock apache should close them for 2 seconds, not more.
I looked at output of netstat. It evidently shows a bug in kernel.
What is version of kernel?
[ Dave! Look, he has 5000 of sockets sort of:
tcp        0      1 195.67.71.80:80         152.166.64.3:1252       LAST_ACK    off (0.00/0)
Retransmission timers massively leak!
