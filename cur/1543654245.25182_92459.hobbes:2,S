Yes, that's true.  However, the heavily used two SCSI disks saw no 
corruption whatsoever, whereas the single, lightly used ATA disk saw 
heavy corruption; if it was due to experimental unrelated code one would 
have expected corruption everywhere.  This does not mean that it is not 
my fault (as far as UML is concerned, I tried building it quite a few 
times before giving up), but given the severity of the corruption I was 
seeing I thought I'd raise a red flag.
