You see nonsensical backtraces because people persist in using the oops
decode option of klogd which is broken when faced with modules.  Turn
off klogd oops (klogd -x) and you get a raw backtrace which ksymoops
can handle.  Guess why these entries are in /proc/ksyms?

ksymoops uses the __insmod entries to work out exactly where each
module is, it gives an accurate backtrace with modules.  man insmod for
details.
Kernel debuggers like kgdb and kdb use kallsyms which has full support
for modules.  kgdb can also use the __insmod entries in /proc/ksyms to
tell gdb where each module was loaded.
ksymoops has a save map option (-s) which writes out the combined
system map, including the kernel and all symbols from all modules.
Sure, a dynamic system requires a little more work, but it has all been
done.  Just kill the broken klogd code so it stops corrupting log data.
