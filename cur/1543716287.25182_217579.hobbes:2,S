No one here really wants to sue you.  Those people who have been arguing 
with you are doing so because they take you seriously.  If they thought 
you were a moron and you were worthless, they would be ignoring you.
I think I speak for many here when I say that we respect your business 
and your right to write the sort of software that you're doing.  We 
would just like you make sure that you follow the law, for your own sake 
as well as ours.

Well, I agree.  Only one person invoked the DMCA.  Others, such as 
myself, invoked Copyright law, which more people agree with.
Look at it this way:  You broke more than one law.

Stop telling us how unintentional it was!

I am not aware that it's a common practice.  Can you provide an example?
However, if someone else it doing it, they are wrong too, and that does 
not give you license to imitate them.

WINE is not a problem for Linux, because it cannot corrupt the kernel 
(it's all in user space).
WINE is not a problem for Windows programs, because making a Windows 
program misbehave in user space does not make the rest of the system 
unstable, and it does not violate any laws.  Also, people using WINE are 
aware that they are using WINE and are therefore not surprised when 
something doesn't work right.  WINE isn't trying to hide from anyone the 
fact that it's a compatibility layer.
