There are internal issues that would cause trouble here--darcs assumes that
if it knows a given patch, it also knows the patch's inverse.

The catch is that then we'd have to implement a smart server to keep users
from having to download the entire history with each update.  That's not a
fundamentally hard issue, but it would definitely degrade darcs' ease of
use, besides putting additional load on the server.  So if something like
this were implemented, I think it would definitely have to be as an
optional format.
Also, we couldn't actually store the data in CVS/SCCS format, since in
darcs a patch to a single file isn't uniquely determined by two states of
that file.  But storing separately the patches relevant to different files
would definitely be an optimization worth considering.
