Wait, Dell explicitly says that pci hotplug of express cards is not
supported and is broken on these laptops.  This is because the version
of Windows they support on these machines also does not support
hotplugging these devices.
The current code works just fine on hardware that actually supports this
kind of functionality, as per the proper specs and requirements for this
feature.
So why try to go through these gyrations for hardware that is explicitly
broken?
