I got the same looking exceptions with rather extensively modularized
2.2.14pre13 kernel running on an old Cabriolet board (__much__ slower
Alpha than what Alexander was using).  It has a tulip ethernet as well
but with a driver is loaded as a module so its initialization happens
much later.  This looks like a rather generic trouble.  Will try to look
closer but not tonight. :-)  Oh, 2.2.14pre12 on the same machine does
not show any such symptoms and mount for 2.2.14pre13 does work despite
exception reports so the system is still bootable.
