This would be an interesting opinion if you were asked for it.
But you were not, yet you keep stating it, therefore you must
feel threatened in some way.
I have to admit that your handling of Alan's desire to do this work
makes you look very non-transparent as the IDE layer maintainer.
What do you care if Alan converts all the drivers with his own time
and effort?  If it's a waste of time, it's his time, which he can
spend in any way he so chooses.  You've already stated that you think
it's a waste of time on at least 2 or 3 occaisions, so I think he and
everyone else gets your point and you don't need to restate this over
and over again.
