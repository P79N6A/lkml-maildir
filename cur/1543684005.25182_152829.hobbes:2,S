Older PA-RISC machines have at the front panel a LED
which shows machine load (4 LEDs), heartbeat (1 LED), 
SCSI activity (1 LED) and network RX/TX (1 LED each).
This panel is programmable via software and a nice and 
consistent linux kernel and userspace API  across the 
architectures is IMHO a good thing.
