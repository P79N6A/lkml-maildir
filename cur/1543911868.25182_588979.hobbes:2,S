Actually it won't oops. And that's because when the file is opened,
xpmem_open() creates a structure for that thread group, and when
xpmem_flush() is called on the close() it first looks for that structure
and if it finds it then it does what it needs to do (which includes the
put_task_struct() call) and then finishes off by destroying the structure.
So for subsequent closes xpmem_flush() returns without calling
put_task_struct().
