I'm not actually using the scenario I described, its just sort of a 
worst-case load-balancing thought experiment.
What we want to be able to do is to specify a fraction of each cpu for 
each task group.  We don't want to have to affine tasks to particular cpus.
This means that the load balancer must be group-aware, and must trigger 
a re-balance (possibly just for a particular group) as soon as the cpu 
allocation for that group is used up on a particular cpu.
I haven't tried the latest CFS group scheduler patches, so they may 
provide the sort of accuracy we're looking for.  I'll have to try and 
find some time to test them out.
