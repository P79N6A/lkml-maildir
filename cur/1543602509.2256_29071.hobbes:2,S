I'm no expert on this, but it looks like a kernel Oops to me - You 
should read /usr/src/linux/Documentation/oops-tracing.txt
The "screen full of numbers" you are refering to is a dump of the 
various machine register states at the time of the crash and a backtrace 
of the instructions that led up to the crash. You should copy it all 
down and run it through the "ksymoops" tool to produce output that will 
be usefull to the kernel developers, then post the ksymoops output.
