No.  Just fall back on the first option (permission checking in each
operation)

OK.  From 1.2 onwards it was just a bugfix branch with the new
features going into the FUSE-2 release.

It doesn't do that and never did.  ERESTARTSYS is only returned if the
operation is interrupted, and in that case the operation is restarted
from scratch, the answer to the old request is never used.

Just disable signal delivery while calling FUSE, and it will never
return -ERESTARTSYS or -ERESTARTNOINTR.

There's not that much difference between the inode and the path model.
If you say each "path component" corresponds to an inode, you have
just solved this problem.

Yes.  And would be pretty easy to add support for this to the FUSE
interface.  It's currently isn't there just because nobody demanded
it.

Yes.  However I think the burden on performance (nothing else), is
justified by the better flexibility.
