there might not be a former owner (in most cases there probably isn't)

some, like reiserfs apparently do (or did, it may be different now, if
not used reiserfs for a long time)

that depends on the person and situation, for me personally lots of my
data isn't critical.  certainly it's annoying to loose data but
probably not life threatening

emacs will usually rename the old file so at the very least you have
that
i've had emacs crash and whilst it's frustrating, it certainly isn't
as bad as loosing an email (which may or may not be important, i'll
decide that after i read it)

i thought that was the point of it?  as best as i can tell the
metadata changes will become visible after the data has updated
however, in the case of something like kde/emacs/whatever you can
*still* loose data
consider something like:
	open with truncate
	crash
or more likely:
	open with truncate
	write some data
	crash
there is also an even more common case than either of these:
        open with truncate
	write data, get -ENOSPC
	spplication terminates/aborts
at which point you've stomped on your file.  it's non uncommong for
KDE to do this (even though the window would apparently be very small)
