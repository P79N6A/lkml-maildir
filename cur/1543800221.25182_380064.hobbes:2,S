ok, i've added the proper From: lines to the patches. [sorry about this, 
we used to rely on the 'author is the top of the SOB lines' very early 
when we introduced SOB, and i forgot that we introduced the From: line 
at the top of metadata later on to make it easier for tools. The 
information itself is redundant.]
