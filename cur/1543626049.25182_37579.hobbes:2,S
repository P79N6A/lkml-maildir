- Mark all members of structures, which get jiffies assigned or involved in
   ugly timeout calculations with the prefix PADAM_  for easy spotting. This is
   Polish for "I'm falling down" or "This brings me to the knees" or slag
   comment for "What a sh..". Please be assured that it doesn't sound vulgar.
   Please grep for it to see immediately why this nomenclature is justified.
- Rename hwifs_s to ata_channel and eliminate ide_hwifs_t as well as the HWIF
   macro. OK this step makes this patch rather big.
