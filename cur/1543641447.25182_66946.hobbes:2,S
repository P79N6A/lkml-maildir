That's usually a hardware or driver, not filesystem, problem.  I've
had a couple of environments which have given data corruptions like
that on IDE drivers in UDMA mode but which were fine in MDMA or PIO
mode.

That can be just a matter of the config options used masking a driver
problem.  Can you still reproduce with "ide=nodma"?  That would
certainly point towards a driver or hardware fault.
