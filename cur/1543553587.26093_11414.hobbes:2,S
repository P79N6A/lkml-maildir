The problem for ARM is that Linux does a lot of the initialisation for
some machines, which basically means the hardware isn't setup for access
to the USB device if the USB initialisation was placed in init/main.c
(this initialisation is done by the very first initcall on ARM).  However,
that said, we may be able to get away with only adding hw_sa1100_init()
before the USB call, but this is only one family of the ARM machine types.
BTW, I've long lost track of what the original problem that sparked off
this thread was, does someone have a quick reference to it?  (please
reply in private mail).  Thanks.
