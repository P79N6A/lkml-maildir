What I meant by ACL was the way NTFS handles it (and afaik solaris has it
now) :  You can assign much more fine grained access to the file.  Instead
of just one group and one owner, you can give any user or group of users
any set of permissions.  Meaning multiple groups and multiple "individual"
access rights.  Its not too difficult to envision doing this with
backwards compatability to rwxrwxrwx.  Its something I would really like
to see Linux get in the near future whether ext3 or otherwise.
