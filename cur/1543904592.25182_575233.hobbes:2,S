Hi Ingo,
I did not have this problem with LTTng, since I only touch atomic
variables in tracing code. However, I iterate on a rcu list of active
traces in a timer interrupt to see if subbuffers must be read and, if
yes, I send a wakeup to my user-space daemon. I had to change the
protection around this rcu list read from preempt disable to mutex lock
in this timer because try_to_wakeup is called in it, which takes a
spinlock.
Note: I don't use relay code at my tracing site.
I guess they might have to switch to such an asynchronous delivery
system if they want to do this properly. Simply put, your polling
solution is exactly what I do, but I check a flag set by the writer
instead of waking up the readers unconditionally.
