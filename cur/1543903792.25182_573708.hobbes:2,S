Ah, ok, so this must be the case we'd stumbled upon recently on the
other thread. I hadn't got your fix for this, so didn't know.

The patch does look correct to me, we're only killing the use of
__volatile__ from places that don't require it (the guarantee-less
variants). Without losing it, I really don't see how the compiler
can ever combine multiple bitops, which does sound beneficial when
the caller has already implemented higher-level locking around
the usage of these operations.
