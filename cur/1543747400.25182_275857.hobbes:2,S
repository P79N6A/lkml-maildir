Are you talking about time complexity based on a named lookup over the
number of files in a directory? (you might also want to look at the
complexity relative to the naming component length). What data structure
which is not wasting memory allows you those lookups? Even if you consider
hashing the name as a constant O(1) operation (which it isnt), you still can
get collisions.
