Ok, thanks.
FWIW the documentation seems to imply that the option is necessary only
when directly booting from SRM, i.e.. no bootloader is involved at all. 
It uses the example of MILO's presence or absence as indicating the need
for this option.
So... is it safe to always enable this option, with a little hacking
perhaps?  :)
