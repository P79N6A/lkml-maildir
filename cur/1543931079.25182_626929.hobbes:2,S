or we just crash somewhere. It's all about risk management - printk is 
crutial, and with more complex codepaths being touched in printk it 
might make sense to just add built-in recursion protection into printk 
via my patch.

yeah, as i mentioned if this would be occuring in practice we can always 
save the stacktrace of the incident and output that. I opted for the 
simplest approach first. Thanks for your Reviewed-by, i've queued it up 
for 2.6.25.
