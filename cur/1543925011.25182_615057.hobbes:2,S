Subject: [PATCH 4/8] KVM: PVDMA: Introduce is_pv_device() dma operation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/7/126

A guest can call dma_ops->is_pv_device() to find out
if a device is a passthrough'ed device (device passed
on to a guest by the host). If this is true, a hypercall
will be made to translate DMA mapping operations.
This function can be done away with and just a
kvm_is_pv_device() call can be added, which can be no-op
on a non-pv guest (or on the host).
