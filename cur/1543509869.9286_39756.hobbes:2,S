was there any response to the issue brought up on the list a while ago
about 2.2.* using 2x the specified value for the SND/RCV buffer?
the offending code is [linux/net/core/sock.c]:
  case SO_SNDBUF:
  if (val > sysctl_wmem_max)
  val = sysctl_wmem_max;
  sk->sndbuf = max(val*2,2048);
this seems pretty retarted to me, is there any reason to give the user twice the
value they asked for?
cheers, Angus.
