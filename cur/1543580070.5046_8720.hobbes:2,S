	Last I knew (straight from the Lucent people), the ISA bridge
card worked fine and the PCI card did NOT work at all.  I've since
confirmed that, first hand, myself (I currently have the ISA bridge in
operation) on the 2.2 kernels.  The ISA bridge also works on the 2.4
kernels but I have not retested the PCI bridge on 2.4.  The Lucent
people claim that the Linux pcmcia people are aware of the problem.
