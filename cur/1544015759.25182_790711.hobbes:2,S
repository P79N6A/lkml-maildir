An allocation automatically falls back to the nearest node on NUMA
cpu_to_node() gives you the current node.
There are 2M TLB entries on x86_64. If we really get into a high usage
scenario then the 2M entry makes sense. Average server memory sizes likely
already are way beyond 10G per box. The higher that goes the more
reasonable the 2M TLB entry will be.
