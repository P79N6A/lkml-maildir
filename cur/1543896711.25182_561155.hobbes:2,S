I also got copied on this without the full context.

Hmm... Probably the change from tristate to bool caused the regression.

The added "default y" are the ones bellow:
menuconfig VIDEO_CAPTURE_DRIVERS
	bool "Video capture adapters"
	depends on VIDEO_DEV
	default y
menuconfig V4L_USB_DRIVERS
	bool "V4L USB devices"
	depends on USB
	default y
menuconfig RADIO_ADAPTERS
	bool "Radio Adapters"
	depends on VIDEO_DEV
	default y
menuconfig DVB_CAPTURE_DRIVERS
	bool "DVB/ATSC adapters"
	depends on DVB_CORE
	default y
config DAB
	boolean "DAB adapters"
	default y
All of them are used just to open a submenu.
I'm to keep "default y" for the menuconfig items. 
Since those don't generate any code (there's no Makefile items
associated with the menuconfig vars), this will just improve the
usability for the final user (and will allow make oldconfig to work).
There's not much sense on selecting V4L support without selecting a V4L
driver.
Cheers,
Mauro
