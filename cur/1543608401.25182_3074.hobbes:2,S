[sorry if this was sent twice]
Hi, I recently tried out both kernels to see the difference between
hdparm -t tests, and the results are disturbing.
Both kernels are configured the same, heres the results:
Linus kernel 2.4.14pre4:
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.59 seconds = 40.25 MB/sec
AC kernel 2.4.13ac5:
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.47 seconds = 25.91 MB/sec
I checked that both had the same settings [with hdparm -v /dev/hda]
The hdd is a seagate 60gig 7200rpm ide, & chipset is via kt133a
If more hardware info is needed, let me know.
