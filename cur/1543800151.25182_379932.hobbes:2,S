By "allows" do you mean we can set the block size to arbitrary values
on MMCI too?
The MMC specification v4.1 is clear in one thing: the SET_BLOCKLEN
command should be issued prior to the actual LOCK_UNLOCK command with
*exactly* the password length + 2 bytes (which contains the operation
mode bits and the password length in bytes). The MMC password
unlocking (and other password operations, FWIW) doesn't work on the
OMAP host if the SET_BLOCKLEN command argument and the block size of
the data transfer itself do not match.
