arch/arm/common/sa1111.c: In function `sa1111_suspend':
arch/arm/common/sa1111.c:816: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer type
This is a rather annoying, and IMHO pointless warning.  First
question: what is the reasoning for using an array of unsigned
bytes here?  Are we expecting to power manage devices which only
have byte wide registers?
In reality, devices have half-word and word sized registers as
well, which means that dev->power.saved_state actually points to
device specific data (or even device driver specific data) for
the device.  As such, it makes far more sense for this to be
a 'void *'.
I'd rather not go around the ARM kernel tree adding pointless
casts to 'u8 *' and back again because the wrong type for this
was picked in the structure definition, so here's a patch which
changes this to void *.
