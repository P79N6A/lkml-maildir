Btw, I sure as hell hope you didn't use "suspend()" for that. You're 
(again) much better off having a totally separate function that just 
freezes stuff.
So in the "snapshot+shutdown" path, you should have:
 - prepare_to_snapshot() - allocate memory, and possibly return errors
   We can skip this, if we just make the rule be that any devices that 
   want to support snapshotting must always have the memory required for 
   snapshotting pre-allocated. Most devices really do allocate memory for 
   their state anyway, and the only real reason for the "prepare" stage 
   here is becasue the final snapshot has to happen with interrupts off, 
   obviously. So *if* we don't need to allocate any memory, and if we 
   don't expect to want to accept some early error case, this is likely 
   useless.
 - snapshot() - actually save device state that is consistent with the 
   memory image at the time. Called with interrupts off, but the device 
   has to be usable both before and afterwards!
And I would seriously suggest that "snapshot()" be documented to not rely 
on any DMA memory, exactly because the device has to be accessible both 
before and after (before - because we're running and allocating memory, 
and after - because we'll be writing thigns out). But see later:
For the "resume snapshot" path, I would suggest having 
 - freeze(): quiesce the device. This literally just does the absolute 
   minimum to make sure that the device doesn't do anything surprising (no 
   interrupts, no DMA, no nothing). For many devices, it's a no-op, even 
   if they can do DMA (eg most disk controllers will do DMA, but only as 
   an actual result of a request, and upper layers will be quiescent 
   anyway, so they do *not* need to disable DMA)
   NOTE! The "freeze()" gets called from the *old* kernel just _before_ a
   snapshot unpacking!!
 - restart_snapshot() - actually restart the snapshot (and usually this 
   would involve re-setting the device, not so much trying to restore all 
   the saved state. IOW, it's easier to just re-initialize the DMA command 
   queues than to try to make them "atomic" in the snapshot).
   NOTE! This gets called by the *new* kernel _after_ the snapshot resume!
And if you *want* to, I can see that you might want to actually do a 
"unfreeze()" thing too, and make the actual shapshotting be:
	/* We may not even need this.. */
	for_each_device() {
		err = prepare_to_snapshot();
		if (err)
			return err;
	}
	/* This is the real work for snapshotting */
	cli();
	for_each_device()
		freeze(dev);
	for_each_device()
		snapshot(dev);
	.. snapshot current memory image ..
	for_each_device_depth_first()
		unfreeze(dev);
	sti();
and maybe it's worth it, but I would almost suggest that you just make the 
rule be that any DMA etc just *has* to be re-initialized by 
"restart_snapshot()", in which case it's not even necessary to 
freeze/unfreeze over the device, and "snapshot()" itself only needs to 
make sure any non-DMA data is safe.
But adding the freeze/unfreeze (which is a no-op for most hardware anyway) 
might make things easier to think about, so I would certainly not *object* 
to it, even if I suspect it's not necessary.
Anyway, the restore_snapshot() sequence should be:
	/* Old kernel.. Normal boot, load snapshot image */
	cli()
	for_each_device()
		freeze(dev);
	restore_snapshot_image();
	restore_regs_and_jump_to_image();
	/* noreturn */
	/* New kernel, gets called at the snapshot restore address
	 * with interrupts off and devices frozen, and memory image
	 * constsntent with what it was at "snapshot()" time
	 */
	for_each_dev_depth_first()
		restore_snapshot(dev);
	/* And if you want to, just to be "symmetric"
		for_each_dev_depth_first()
			unfreeze(dev)
	   although I think you could just make "restore_snapshot()" 
	   implicitly unfreeze it too..
	 */
	sti();
	/* We're up */
and notice how *different* this is from what happens for s2ram. There 
really isn't anything in common here. Exactly because s2ram simply doesn't 
_have_ any of the issues with atomic memory images.
So s2ram is just
	for_each_dev()
		suspend(dev);
	cli();
	for_each_dev()
		late_suspend(dev);
	.. go to sleep ..
	for_each_dev_depth_first()
		early_resume(dev);
	sti();
	for_each_dev_depth_first()
		resume(dev);
and has none of the "freeze" issues at all.
Doesn't that seem a lot more straightforward? Yes, it's more functions, 
but each function is a lot more obvious. This follows the unix rule of "do 
one thing, and do that thing well", instead of trying to make one function 
do many very different things depending on what you actually want done..
