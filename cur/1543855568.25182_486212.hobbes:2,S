Subject: [ANNOUNCE] KVM userspace release 5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Changes:
 - AMD SVM support (x86-64 hosts only)
 - Preliminary live migration support
 - 'make install' also installs kernel modules, if selected
 - random fixes
The kernel package in this release produces three modules: kvm.ko, 
kvm-intel.ko, and kvm-amd.ko.  To use kvm, you must either 'modprobe 
kvm-$arch', or 'insmod /path/to/kvm.ko; insmod /path/to/kvm-$arch.ko'.
The new live migration feature (at present more accurately described as 
"zombie migration", since the guest does not make progress while it is 
migrated) can be used as follows (assume two hosts A, B):
1. A: Start a VM. Play with it for a while.
2. B: Start a VM with *exactly* the same options, plus a '-S'.  The disk 
images must be shared.
3. A: switch to monitor (alt-ctrl-2), type 'stop'.
4. B: switch to monitor, type 'migration listen'.
5. A: 'migration connect'
6. A: 'migration start offline'
7. A: 'quit'
8: B: 'cont', and switch to display (alt-ctrl-1)
