I ran setpci -s 00:04.0 81.b=b0, etc., but it didn't make any
difference.  Checking with lspci -vvxxx after running setpci it
appears that register 81 and a8 have stayed at 90 and 10 despite
setpci running without an error, using -G and -v setpci claims to be
running through /proc/bus/pci and adjusting the appropriate location.
Either I am making a fundamental error (yes, I am running it as root)
or the changes simply don't matter.

The comptuer has 320MB.  At this point I am ready to conclude that the
computer is broken in some way, because nobody else with an Inspiron
5000e that I have heard from has anything like this problem.
I really appreciate the help everybody is providing with what is
really only an annoyance, and I wouldn't have even brought it to the
attention of linux-kernel, except that something that changed between
2.2.17 and 2.4.x has produced a regression in functionality.  If
anybody thinks it would be useful, I would be willing to do a binary
search between 2.2.17 and 2.4.2 to find out at which release things
stopped being setup correctly.
