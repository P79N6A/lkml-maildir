Awesome! Thanks for doing that.
One other git quirk that I'm not sure how to work around btw..
Something I find useful is to just do for eg..
git log arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/acpi-cpufreq.c
from time to time, to figure out when certain changes happened,
or even to grep for something in a changelog.
With that file moved, git refuses to tell me about the log
of a file that doesn't exist, and the log of the moved
file in arch/x86 just has a single commit, detailing the move.
Is there an easy way to get the complete log of a file?
