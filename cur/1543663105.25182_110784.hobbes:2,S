Well, and does slow-low-power mean 300MHz, 1.4V as bios said, or
300MHz, 1.2V which is probably also safe?
What about
"as-fast-as-possible-but-not-exceed-140MHz-because-batteries-are-
running-low-and-can-not-give-enough-current"? That's different from
"fast-high-power", but it is *also* different from
"slow-low-power". [This actually matters on beasts like zaurus]. What
about
"as-low-power-as-possible-but-make-sure-you-can-keep-display-up"? [On
some machines cpu must be > some HMz for display to still work].
Power managment is complex...
