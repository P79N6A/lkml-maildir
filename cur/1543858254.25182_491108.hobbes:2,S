Are there any dependencies in $subject which would preclude changing
drivers/video/Kconfig with:
 config FB_RADEON_BACKLIGHT
         bool "Support for backlight control"
-        depends on FB_RADEON && PMAC_BACKLIGHT
+        depends on FB_RADEON
         select FB_BACKLIGHT
         default y
         help
           Say Y here if you want to control the backlight of your display.
or is radeon_backlight.c only functional when -DCONFIG_PMAC_BACKLIGHT,
even though the pmac routines are all ifdef'ed?
