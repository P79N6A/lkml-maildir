Well, AFAIK, IDEA is free for non-commercial use. I don't see a big

There are implementations for Blowfish, Serpent, etc. in the
international kernel, properly made available for the CryptoAPI. Why
waste these effords? Also, if you provide only AES you can be sure the
developers that we want to use this API will implement their algorithms
themselves again, be it only because of personal preferences.
It is also always a good idea to have one fairly old cipher available
that has gotten massive peer-review instead of blindly using the newest
cipher.

nod. The same arguments apply for Blowfish and so on. I really don't
want to be limited to just one or two ciphers in the kernel. AFAIU the
IPSec standard is open for various ciphers that are negotiated between
hosts. Building a conformant implementation therefore requires to
support most of them.
  Making an interface to implement new ciphers easily would also
motivate people to write assembler versions for different archs and that
would be very welcome because of speed considerations. Crypto is still
something that cannot be fast enough.
