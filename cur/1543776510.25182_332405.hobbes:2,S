(And I don't see a good enough reason to use #defines when you don't
 absolutely have to. This is what we disagree on.)
Roman, it is not as if I get to decide for the patch submitters. I
comment on any issues _I_ have with the patch and the authors fix
whatever they want (or what the maintainers ask for).
As I disagree with the part about enums being a personal preference, I
will continue to comment on them in the future. If patch authors wish to
ignore them (or any of my comments for that matter), that's ok with me.
P.S. Working code is not enough for the kernel. It must be maintainable
as well.
