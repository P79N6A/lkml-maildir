Hmm, 2.4.2-ac28 and 2.4.3 have the same collection of VIA fixups in
arch/i386/kernel/pci-pc.c.  Something else must be causing this?

Did you run the .config through a 'make oldconfig' on each kernel, to
catch CONFIG name changes and so forth?

Does the BIOS have a setting that sounds like "System performance
setting" with choices such as "Optimal" or "Normal"? If so, try both
settings.  The terminology above is what is used on the ASUS A7V.
>Here is the output of lspci:
What would be quite useful, I think, is the output of 'lspci -xxx -s
0:0' under both the non-corrupting kernel (2.4.2-ac28) and the
corrupting kernel (2.4.3).  The output of 'dmesg' under both kernels
would also be good.
I find that a good way to present information like that, where most of
it should be the same and one is looking for the differences, is via
'diff -u --unified=1000 a b'.
Cheers,
Wayne
