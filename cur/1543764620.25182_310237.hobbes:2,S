Perhaps it makes sense to create a new lpc subsystem with an lpc bus
type. Then the PCI driver would register a new lpc bus and LPC device
drivers would register themselves with that. Or if the LPC is
independent of any PCI device the LPC "bridge" driver would just be
another driver to be loaded.
It sounds like it might end up similar to the i2c subsystem for example.
