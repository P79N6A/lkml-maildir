This is a known problem, or rather two of them:
 1) when dirtying lots of memory via mmap writeout happens pretty randmomly
    inside the file and the filesystem has problems creating nice clusters.
    In the case of extent based filesystems that's really bad as the extent
    map is fragmented now
 2) XFS keeps each inode's extent map in one single memory block.
You're seeing allocation errors where we are trying to realloc that memory
block.
Could you try the patches that Nikita posted to -mm that should improve
this behaviour?
