Unfortunately not: it's a semantic change.  Previously as per Unix standard, 
>=0 was good, < 0 was bad.  This resulted in some confusion, and so Alexey 
proposed tightening the rules, to only allow <= 0 values.
So we don't know that the module is buggy.  It's possible that it's returning 
ENODEV instead of -ENODEV, but it's also possible that it's returning 1 to 
mean "ok".

Depends which way the failure is.  Andrew said not to break existing systems.
To avoid this, we'd need an audit which noone wants to do, so we're being 
lazy.
Hope that clarifies my thinking,
Rusty.
