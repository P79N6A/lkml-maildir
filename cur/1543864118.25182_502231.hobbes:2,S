it is because
1. this didn't make it into 2.6.20 before -rc1, and Linus prohibits adding features thereafter
2. these patches simultaneously depend on ACPI, hotplug, and IA64 platform dependent code,
    so it isn't always clear who owns them.  However, if Greg and Tony Ack them,
    I'll be happy to carry them upstream with the ACPI tree.
I'll reply to this note with a shim patch to help these apply, and a  pair of refreshed SGI patches
that apply on top of the ACPI tree.  Build tested vs sn2_defconfig , but SGI will have to test it on hardware.
thanks,
