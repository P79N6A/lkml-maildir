Each one gets the patches from people who tested them on their machines
(presumably), and the maintainer signs them off for code decency and (if he
has the hardware) working on his machine too. It is very hard to get much
more than that in terms of early testers. Again, one of the standard
complaints here is that very few test the -rcX kernels, and then scream
murder when the -final breaks. Now consider the case of proposed patches...
Yet, the solution is /very/ simple: Instead of complaining, set up a
machine with the hardware that particularly interests you, get on the
relevant lists, find out where the proposed patches are kept and test
them. You could even add a Signed-off-by: line to the patches you check
out. And again, "somebody should do..." won't get you anywhere, "here I
do..."  has more of a chance of success.
