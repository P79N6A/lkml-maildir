I upgraded reiserfsck and tried again. Now a note appears that I
obviously created my partitions with an older version of reiserfsprogs
and that the journal header was fixed.
Otherwise, it behaves similar, the last message is "Replaying journal"
and that hangs forever.

Yes, but only very few work: after ^C and PrintScreen a prompt
appears: "press Control-D for normal startup or enter root password"
(something similar; ^D works well) and SysRq-... work normally (magic
key).

That's very difficult, no consoles are active at that time. There are
no error messages and no messages that don't appear with 2.4.x, apart
from the warnings about missing module stuff. I can photograph it if
you want.
> can you press sysrq-T at the time of a hang and then send us the traces?
That's even more difficult, it produces several screenfulls of text
scrolling away very fast. I'd need a serial console for this purpose
but it will last a while to set this up since I don't have the
necessary hardware here. I could do it tomorrow.
Thanks and have a nice day!
Martin
