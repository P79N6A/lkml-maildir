"[zero-copy receive] generally requires some sort of intelligence on the
NIC to make sure that the payload starts in its own buffer.  This is
called "header splitting".  Currently the only NICs with support for
header splitting are Alteon Tigon 2 based boards running slightly
modified firmware."
Perhaps that explains it.
Not to mention the other complications that are involved if you scroll
down the page and read the FAQ.
Have you done any profiling work to see where your CPU cycles are being
spent?
