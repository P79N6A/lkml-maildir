Thanks Pat for the initial feedback.  I can post a set of patches to
e1000 using the new API; I'll try to get them out asap (need to apply to
this kernel tree).  However, the PRIO qdisc still uses the priority in
the bands for dequeueing priority, and will feed the queues on the NIC.
The e1000, and any other multiqueue NIC, will schedule Tx based on how
the PRIO qdisc feeds the queues.  So the only priority here is the
dequeuing priority from the kernel.  The e1000 will use the new API for
starting/stopping the individual queues based on the descriptors
available, much like it does today for the global queue.
