Breaking my build is ok, I can trivially fix those. Usually it's a 
one-liner, and that's not the thing I worry about.
I worry about the fact that I'm aboud to releaser 2.5.48, and then it
doesn't compile for some silly reason, even though I've obviously tested 
it on my configurations and fixed the problems _I_ saw.
Cleaning up header files is fine, but the trivial part is to remove the 
line that includes another header file. The _real_ work is trying to 
figure out that nothing else broke as a result, and I think that's what a 
janitor who does these things should really care about.
The whole "janitor" name to me implies somebody who does the hand and ugly 
and mostly boring thing that needs to be done to clean stuff up and make 
sure things work smoothly. A "janitorial" patch that leaves broken pieces 
in random places of the tree doesn't sound very janitorial to me, if you 
see what I mean..
