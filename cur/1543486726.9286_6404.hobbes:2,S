Hello,
Since NFS (server & client sides) would be for us the main reason (not
to say the only one) to switch from the 2.0.36 kernel to the 2.2.x serie,
I am playing with it and have some questions.
We have a medium sized network with around 500/600 NFS machines beeing
able to mount each NFS server (even if, by now, for the Linux server, we
have managed to have no more than 50 machines accessing the NFS partitions
at a given time).
1)	using knfsd, is it necessary to run kexportfs -a in the startup
	script. Here is what I am currently using :
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs :
	[...]
	case "$1" in
	  start)
		# Start daemons.
		echo -n "Starting NFS services: "
		daemon rpc.kmountd
		daemon rpc.knfsd
		/usr/sbin/kexportfs -a		<- needed ?
		echo
		touch /var/lock/subsys/nfs
		;;
	[...]
	My worry is that, when rebooting, knfsd keeps the current
	estimated state of the remote mountages in its files
	/var/lib/nfs/xtab (and rmtab). When running kexportfs -a,
	the command blocks for a very long time, depending on how
	many entries there were in theses files (typically more
	than 110 entries in xtab, 60 in rmtab). Starting from
	fresh (empty files) is almost instantaneous.
	My /etc/exports file is :
	/u0     @urd(rw)
	/u1     @urd(rw)
	If I do not run kexportfs -a, I can not mount partitions
	via NFS, so I really need to run it. But 10 to 15 minutes
	spent on the command is too long.
	Has someone else seen the problem.
2)	The servers may have to reboot (we are doing that perdiodically,
	once every week sometimes). I have observed bad behavior from
	the 2.2.x Linux clients when one of their server is rebooting
	(the load gets very high, and the machine is almost unusable).

3)	We plan to replace an old Sun IPC which serves as DNS server,
	NIS master, sendmail router (and deliver), samba, xntp, UUCP, plus
	other things, (and which has a propension to CPU Panic up and
	there these latests weeks) by a Linux box.
	We need NFS performance for mail delivery (via procmail), so
	for me the only reasonnable option is to use a 2.2.x kernel.
	I guess we will have to wait a few more weeks for things to
	stabilize, but what is your opinion ?
A+
