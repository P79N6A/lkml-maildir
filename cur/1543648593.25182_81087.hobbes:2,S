Oh.  We still have:
                if (request_irq(hwif->irq,&ide_intr,sa,hwif->name,hwgroup)) {
                        if (!match)
                                kfree(hwgroup);
                        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&ide_lock, flags);
request_irq() was changed to use GFP_ATOMIC, so it's "fixed".
But only for i386.
request_irq() inside spinlock is a *very* common bug.  Moreso
as people move cli()-using code across to use spinlocks.
And we've just lost our ability to detect this bug.
request_irq() needs to take the allocation mode as an argument.
Should always have.  Sigh.  I'll fix it up sometime.
