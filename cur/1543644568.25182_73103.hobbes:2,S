Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

First:
In linux-2.4.19, I found the following:
fs/reiserfs/super.c:707
 s->s_blocksize = sb_blocksize(rs);
 s->s_blocksize_bits = 0;
 while ((1 << s->s_blocksize_bits) != s->s_blocksize)
     s->s_blocksize_bits ++;
What happens if there's a bit-flip on the disk so that s->s_blocksize is
not a power of two ?
I would suggest replacing the '!=' with a '<' in the while loop and
adding a sanity check afterwards.
After all, a single bit-flip in the root fs superblock would cause the
system to hang silently (but spinning really fast!) at boot.
Second:
As I see it, the ReiserFS journal has the same problems as jbd wrt. to
atomicity of write operations of indexes.  Please see my recent mail
about the jbd problems.
