Lawrence Berkeley Labs.  Physicists have collosal data sets these days.
I've worked in labs where any file older than 5 days was deleted if it
was on a certain partition.  You were supposed to keep your data on tape
and only use the disk for immediate work.  And those partitions were huge.
The CERN Aleph detector, when I visited it back in '93, had exabyte tapes
running _in_parallel_ to be able to collect all the data fast enough.  That
and automatic loading of the tapes.
