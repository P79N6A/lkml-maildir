Right, I see what you mean. Disabling the beep is one thing I always
do, and it requires a few differnt steps, like "xset b off" for xterms
and so on.  It would be nice to switch it off in one place and be done
with it.

This looks good to me.  As far as I can tell, it looks like the beep
is generated by kd_mksound, which is a function pointer that usually
points to drivers/char/vt.c:_kd_mksound().  Can anyone verify this?
It doesn't look to hard to write a sysctl driver that would change the
function pointer to something quieter.  Is this what patch did?
