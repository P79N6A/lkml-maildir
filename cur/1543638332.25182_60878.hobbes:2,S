   IMHO we shouldn't blindly decide for (or against!) this patch
   but also carefully look at the large page patch from RHAS (which
   got added to -aa recently) and the large page patch which IBM
   is working on.
And the one from Naohiko Shimizu which is my personal favorite
because sparc64 support is there :)
