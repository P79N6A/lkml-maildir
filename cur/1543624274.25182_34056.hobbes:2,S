No, I'm just reacting to alan's email where he mentions the "other goings 
on" - as opposed to your patch which even Alan agreed with.
Note that I've actually tried to read all patches, and right now they are 
all in my tree (of course, the "all" is the Linus kind of "all", which 
only includes the ones I actually _noticed_. 
That includes your AMD IDE driver change _and_ the oh-so-much-discussed
patches by Martin (which in turn included Pavel's change, which - together
with his changelog entry - seems to be the one that triggered the "lively
discussions").
