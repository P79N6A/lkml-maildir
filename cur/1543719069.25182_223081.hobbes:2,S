Hello,
I'm somewhat ignorant on the inner workings of swsusp. I have a 256MB
laptop machine running 2.6.7-rc1-bk2 + ACPI + swsusp two swap
partitions, a 256MB swap partition on /dev/hda4 plus another 256MB swap
on /dev/hda5. When trying to hibernate to disk, swsusp fails with the
following error message:
PCMCIA: socket cf71302c: *** DANGER *** unable to remove socket power
Stopping tasks:

What I can't unserstand is how swsusp fails with "couldn't get enough
free pages". cat /proc/swaps tells:
Filename                  Type            Size    Used    Priority
/dev/hda4                 partition       281128  0       0
/dev/hda5                 partition       281096  192     1
What going on here? Why does swsusp fail when there is plenty of free
swap space?
NOTE: The same happens while only using a big, 512MB swap partition.
Thanks.
