Thanks.  Implementing it is way beyond me, but it's good to hear that
other people might find it useful.

Maybe.  The GC I wanted to use this with is rather constrained in some
ways - it can't walk the stack, for instance - so it can only collect
when the mutator tells it it's okay.  I suppose it could just copy the
list to its own buffer and continue, which saves the kernel from
having to store a potentially very large list.

Well, yeah, that would be the cleanest thing, but it does require two
dirty bits.

They certainly ought to be.

Again, this is not particularly useful to me since the collector can't
collect at arbitrary points - but it would be a good thing to have for
a general GC, and maybe I ought to be using a general GC anyway...
