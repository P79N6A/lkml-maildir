Umm what worked for me was to do the following :
change the following line in os-interface.c (Part of NVIDIA_kernel package):
    symbol_value = get_module_symbol(NV_MODULE_NAME, symbol_name);
to :
    symbol_value = inter_module_get_request(NV_MODULE_NAME, symbol_name);
and then remove the following lines which appear after the above lines :
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2, 4, 0)
    put_module_symbol(symbol_value);
#endif
Now there may be something else that needs changing, but after doing the
above, the driver loaded up fine as did XFree86.
