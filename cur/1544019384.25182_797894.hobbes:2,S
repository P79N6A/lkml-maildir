I applied the patch but it still locked up in the testing NMI 
watchdog code. Not saying your patch is at fault, because we never made it 
to your code. This is probably not an issue, since if we have low memory 
at bootup, we have much bigger problems to deal with.
I'll have skip the NMI test and see if it locks up any place else.
