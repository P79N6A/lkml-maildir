Hi,
I was wondering why it is necessary for the usb_hub_thread() in
drivers/usb/hub.c to have the big kernel lock with lock_kernel() ?
What is it with lock_kernel() anyway ?
extern __inline__ void lock_kernel(void)
{
#if 1
        if (!++current->lock_depth)
                spin_lock(&kernel_flag);
#else
        __asm__ __volatile__(
                "incl %1\n\t"
                "jne 9f"
                spin_lock_string
                "\n9:"
                :"=m" (__dummy_lock(&kernel_flag)),
                 "=m" (current->lock_depth));
#endif
} 
Can someone explain what is behind lock_kernel() and
these changes (#if 1) in 2.4 ?
Is there any documentation for this out there ?
Thanks,
Armin
