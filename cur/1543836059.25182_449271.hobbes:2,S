I notice that the first few reports (kernels <= 2.6.14) have len=4096,
while the later reports (kernels >= 2.6.16) have len=2048.  So
assuming it's the same bug, the use after free has moved from a
4096-byte slab to a 2048-byte slab.  Were there ny data structures we
shrank between 2.6.14 and 2.6.16?
