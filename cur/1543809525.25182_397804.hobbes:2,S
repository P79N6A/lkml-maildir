Seems perfectly plain to me, but if you don't like it I can change it.

No.  time_adjust_step is in microseconds and is restricted to the
range -tickadj .. tickadj, and tickadj is between 1 and 10 (assuming
HZ >= 50).  tick_nsec is around 1e9 / HZ.  There's no way delta_nsec
could end up less than 0 or larger than around 20 million for any
reasonable HZ value (i.e. >= 50).
