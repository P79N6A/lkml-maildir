  I can understand the opinnions expressed by these quotes.
  Having seen how horribly certain CORBA monsters work, I am sure
  that the basic idea of threads is lost somewhere along the way...

   That is usually true.   In rare cases I *do* want to use threads, or
   things just alike them.
   Pre-requisite are for wanting to share very large amounts of the VM
   of the processes and/or IO descriptors, have multiple processors in
   the system capable to execute my code, and wanting to parallellize
   (with lack of AIO) certain IO activities (disk related, mainly) which
   normal non-blocking IO can't handle.
   Threads are like salt, best used in moderation.
   They are resources, and hogging them will very rapidly cause
   the harms to exceed the benefits.
   (...that CORBA beast...)  ... creates a thread for each incoming
   request without any sort of limit at how much there can be threads
   running in parallel.

   If they weren't, I would be most amazed..
