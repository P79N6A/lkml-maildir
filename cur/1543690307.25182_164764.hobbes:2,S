Widely accepted does not necessary implies clear.
Sorry if I consider more readable this:
ch=acquire(CHANNEL_ID);
instead of this:
while((fd = open("fifo", O_WRONLY)) < 0) ;
But this is quite an aestethical fact.
If you like "open" and "write", open Emacs and do a global replace
"acquire" with "open"
and
"zc_send" with "write".
Few other minor details will make it a compatible interface.
