 Hi Greg,
 I'm re-sending two patches I sent to you last week, because I guess they get
lost in the e-mail thread.
 The first patch adds missing checks in the usb-serial driver which can
avoid NULL pointer dereferences. The second one fixes a race-condition.
 Both patches have the full description, and by your comments, you were
inclined to accept them I guess.
 Thank you,
