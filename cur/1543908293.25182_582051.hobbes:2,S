(no need to CC me)
So far I'm seeing this: 
- On 2.6.21 I mount the drive. After a while it spins down, and when I then
unmount it, an error pops up in dmesg.
- On 2.6.18 I can't provoke the same error. The drive doesn't appear to spin
down. I don't know if the data corruption from 2.6.21 occurs with regular
use.
There are a number of other factor I need to eliminate on my system, but
that's it so far. CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND is not set on either kernel.
