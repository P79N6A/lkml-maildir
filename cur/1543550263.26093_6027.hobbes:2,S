Yeah, but this is a no-brainer change which can also be
applied to the normal VM in 30 minutes.
The real reason classzone could be interesting is that
(combined with per-node memory_pressure info) it could
be used to better balance memory pressure across nodes.
Say that the local node got allocated a slightly too big
job and the node next door has some spare capacity. In
that case classzone could be used to make sure we'll:
1) use some memory from the other node instead of swapping
2) don't start swapping too much on the local node because
   it wouldn't be good
Using information like memory_pressure difference and node
distance, we can use classzone to use the NUMA beast a bit
more efficiently.
The only question here is, can we abstract this away in
such a way that:
1) the code is clean and efficient
2) we don't do any of this complex stuff on "normal" machines
Oh, and then there's of course the question of the pagecache_lock,
but that's quite a separate issue from the memory allocation and
balancing ;)
regards,
Rik
