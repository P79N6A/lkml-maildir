Hi All,
i've been running kernel 2.4.21-preX series for a while on my ASUS A7V8X 
motherboard ( with an athlon XP 2400+ )  and i've noticed the following 
annoying problem.
Very often, mozilla ( 1.2.1 ) dies and is stuck in D state, waiting on a 
semaphore, here's the output of ps :
ps -elf | grep mozill
000 S userX 2615  1462  0  69   0    -   972 wait4  00:50 ? 
00:00:00 /bin/sh /usr/local/mozilla/run-mozilla.sh 
/usr/local/mozilla/mozilla-bin
000 D userX   2621  2615  0  69   0    - 13623 down   00:50 ? 
00:00:02 /usr/local/mozilla/mozilla-bin
Has anyone noticed the same behaviour ? Is this a well known problem ?
Thanks for your help.
Regards
Charles-Edouard Ruault
