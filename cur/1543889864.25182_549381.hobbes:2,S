I don't see any requirement that a device that generates MSI
interrupts must also be able to signal the same interrupts via INTx.
The spec explicitly says:
    "All PCI Express device Functions that are capable of generating
    interrupts must support MSI or MSI-X or both."
but there is no corresponding explicit requirement that legacy INTx
mode be supported, so it certainly seems permitted for a device not to
generate INTx interrupts.  In fact as you alluded to, the spec says,
    "The legacy INTx emulation mechanism may be deprecated in a future
    version of this specification."
and I wouldn't think the intention would be for one version of the
spec to *require* something that is planned on being deprecated later.
And the Pathscale guys were pretty confident that their device was
compliant with the PCIe spec.
