Applied, but... :)
In reviewing your patch, I noticed more ugliness.  Can you be convinced
to take care of these, too?
In acpi_init(), it is possible for the function to error exit without
cleaning up from a successful acpi_claim_ioports call.
Further, acpi_claim_ioports itself is pretty nasty if some of its
acpi_claim calls succeed, and others fail.
We're getting there..
