Cool, thanks.

I can't comment on the kernel implementation side of it much, but see

Ohh yes. This would make the battery code in HAL so much better. There
is so much legacy crud for batteries that we have to wade through in
HAL. A battery kernel class is a very good idea IMO.

No, I think the distinction between batteries and ac_adapter is large
enough to have different classes of devices. You may have many
batteries, but you'll only ever have one ac_adapter. I'm not sure it's
an obvious abstraction to make.

How are battery change notifications delivered to userspace? I know acpi
is using the input layer for buttons in the future (very sane IMO), so
using sysfs events for each property changing would probably be nice.
Comments on your patch:
> +#define BAT_INFO_TEMP2		(2) /* °C/1000 */
Temperature expressed in degrees C/1000? - what if the temperature goes
below 0? What about just using mK (kelvin / 1000) - I don't know what is
used in the kernel elsewhere tho. Also, are you allowed the ° sign in
kernel source now?
> +#define BAT_INFO_CURRENT	(6) /* mA */
Can't this also be expressed in mW according to the ACPI spec?
> +#define BAT_STAT_FIRE		(1<<7)
I know there is precedent for "FIRE" but maybe CRITICAL or DANGER might
be better chosen words. We can reserve the word FIRE for when the faulty
battery really is going to explode...
