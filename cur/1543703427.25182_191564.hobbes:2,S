For the system I noticed the ACPI problems (Asus PR-DLS533),
the regression occured after 2.4.21
With pristine 2.4.21 the system could boot with ACPI enabled,
but with the new ACPI patches introduced with the 2.4.21-ac
series (and integrated in the 2.4.x series later on) it did not.
Does your board have several PCI busses (lspci -v) ?
It seems the problem is with the BIOS not correctly initializing
and/or reporting some ACPI data structures, so the Linux ACPI code
does not find (and therefore initialize) some devices on higher PCI
bus numbers.
It looks like it's Asus who should fix their BIOS.
Does anyone know how the other OS(tm) does handle
ACPI PCI bus initialisation on these boards? Do
they have some workaround for such broken BIOS?
(I have never tried the other OS(tm) on this board)
