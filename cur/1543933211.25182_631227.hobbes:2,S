hm, spose so.  But if we're to do this then we'd need to fix qsize and
r_maxsize and various other things.  And we'd need to convert msg_bytes to
atomic_size_t, which would prove interesting ;)
So this is at best a partial conversion and the code in there does need
careful checking for the use of appropriate types.  Does this patch get us
partway toward the proper solution?  Dunno - someone would need to sit down
and work out what the best types are for all those related things.
