Hi,
Sorry for this nursery-school question.
Could someone briefly explain me :
1. what is the kernel page size (any _useful_ pointer on the web is fine),
2. how can one tune it (for 2.6.*)?
3. what kind of effect does it have on system performance, if it is
tuneable, and if it worth changing this at all?
I am a bit confused; at one place i see someone saying that the kernel
page size is 4kb for i386.
At another place I see a statement:
"I tried all four possible page sizes on Itanium (4k, 8k, 16k and 64k)"
How can i figure out the page size of the kernel i am currently using?
Cheers
Gaspar
