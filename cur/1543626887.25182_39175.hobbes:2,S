That's a pretty weak argument coming from an OS that doesn't ship
with a kernel debugger <grumble> by default.   After all, modules
can still come from anywhere (say a floppy).  I still think
this is a silly policy, but as you can see by the recent renaming
of the driver files, I've come to accept it. 8-)

Since this is the case, and the Makefile will return to this format
as soon as the U320 driver is released, can we come up with an
interrim Makefile that assumes the new driver will show up shortly?

Both drivers use the same assembler.  Otherwise I would have split
the second out into its own directory.
