Hello,
I think as more and more people want to burn CD that the patch proposed
from the writer of the great cdrecord (
ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/alpha/SG.patch.tar.gz
) should be included...
That's also the case of 
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.2/devfs-patch-current.gz
 that allow a lots of usefull things with devices names (who has
newer got a problem because he has added a disk that came before another?)...
And the patches from Alan Cox...
I succeed without problem in compiling a kernel with each separate patch, but anyway I tried to patch, I got some rejected, so I don't know if it's enough secure to test such
patched kernel?
Is there a special reason for not including those patches together?
Thanks for all,
	Greg
