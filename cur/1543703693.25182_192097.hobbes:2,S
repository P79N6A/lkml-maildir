I can't imagine why anybody would even attempt to write a kernel
module in C++. Next thing it'll be Visual BASIC, then Java. The
kernel is written in C and assembly. The tools are provided. It
can only be arrogance because this whole C v.s. C++ thing was
hashed-over many times. Somebody apparently wrote something to
"prove" that it can be done. I'd suggest that you spend some
time converting it to C if you need that "module". The conversion
will surely take less time than going through the kernel headers
looking for "::".
