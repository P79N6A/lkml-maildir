GCC 2.95.3, +4 both work with a patch from Phil Blundell, as detailed
in the build instructions for these versions.
GCC 3.x introduces the dodgy practice of removing the frame pointer
from every function despite telling the compiler not to with
-fno-omit-frame-pointer.  It's also contary to the GCC documentation
when it interferes with debugging.
Overall, using gcc 3.1 causes the following problems in _any_ kernel:
1. crashes when things like knfsd and other kernel daemons exit.
2. you can't get a call trace from the kernel.
For anyone, I'd recommend using gcc 2.95.[34] for building a kernel that
should be stable and can be trusted.  gcc 3.x is still very experimental
afaiac.  We're still finding its quirks.
