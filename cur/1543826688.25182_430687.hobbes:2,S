It hurts writing, not reading.  And only certain cases of writing.
But when it hurts it hurts quite a bit; slowdown is 10-20 times and gigE
most likely won't matter.

Sequential read and write seems to be fine. At least from my testing.
This was what made this so weird; normal testing with dd or bonnie etc.
showed all was fine. But link jobs over NFS were unreasonably slow.
Turned out you needed a somewhat special read/write pattern (similar to
ld) to trigger the slowdown.
So I guess it's probably mostly people who do development over NFS who
are hurt - and then only those who produce rather large executables.
