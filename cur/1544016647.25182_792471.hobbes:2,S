You and Alan so like bash... Applications are not always forked from shell.
I already pointed multiple times where parent om_adj changes lead, and
that this does not work in a real world for some common cases. Existing
scheme only works if some daemon (or application itself) explicitely
changes oom_adj, but no dameon exists to monitor /proc and applications
do not change their own and child's oom_adj because it is way too
linuxish to add such hacks to deal with system's oom-killer, which can
not be properly configured otherwise.
