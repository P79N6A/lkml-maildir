Thank you for the description of problem. So far I have a similar one
in mind: if we are to delay writeback of atime-dirty-only inodes to
above 1 hour, some grouping/piggy-backing scenario would be
beneficial.  (Which I guess does not deserve the complexity now that
we have Ingo's make-reltime-default patch.)
My vague idea is to
- keep the s_io/s_more_io as a FIFO/cyclic writeback dispatching queue.
- convert s_dirty to some radix-tree/rbtree based data structure.
  It would have dual functions: delayed-writeback and clustered-writeback.
clustered-writeback:
- Use inode number as clue of locality, hence the key for the sorted
  tree.
- Drain some more s_dirty inodes into s_io on every kupdate wakeup,
  but do it in the ascending order of inode number instead of
  ->dirtied_when. 
delayed-writeback:
- Make sure that a full scan of the s_dirty tree takes <=30s, i.e.
  dirty_expire_interval.
Notes:
(1) I'm not sure inode number is correlated to disk location in
    filesystems other than ext2/3/4. Or parent dir?
(2) It duplicates some function of elevators. Why is it necessary?
    Maybe we have no clue on the exact data location at this time?
