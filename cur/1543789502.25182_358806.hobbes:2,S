Thanks Paul for reminding us that call_rcu() should not ever call the callback 
function, as very well documented in Documentation/RCU/UP.txt
(Example 3: Death by Deadlock)
But is the same true for call_rcu_bh() ?
I intentionally wrote the comment to remind readers that a low maxbatch can 
trigger OOM in case a CPU is filled by some kind of DOS (network IRQ flood for 
example, targeting the IP dst cache)
To solve this problem, may be we could add a requirement to 
call_rcu_bh/callback functions  : If they have to lock a spinlock, only use a 
spin_trylock() and make them returns a status (0 : sucessfull callback, 1: 
please requeue me)
As most callback functions just kfree() some memory, most of OOM would be cleared.
int my_rcu_callback(struct rcu_head *p)
{
	if (!spin_trylock(&mylock))
		return 1; /* please call me later */
	/* do something here */
	...
	spin_unlock(&mylock);
	return 0;
}
(Changes to rcu_do_batch() are left as an exercice :) )
