Subject: [PATCH] backlight users need to select BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE

I seem to have a similar issue, but with ACPI_TOSHIBA=y.  It does not
look like the backlight support is intended to be optional.  I also
note that ACPI_SONY is already select'ing BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
directly.
The attached patch seems like the right thing.  I have tested this
with the config I had showing the problem.  My kernels now compile
again.
Seems that this change comes in from the following patch:
  add-support-for-the-generic-backlight-device-to-the-toshiba-acpi-driver
Does this seem sane?

backlight users need to select BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
When compiling 2.6.19-rc2-mm1 we get the following link
failures:
  drivers/built-in.o(.init.text+0x3076): In function `toshiba_acpi_init':
    : undefined reference to `backlight_device_register'
  drivers/built-in.o(.exit.text+0x170): In function `toshiba_acpi_exit':
    : undefined reference to `backlight_device_unregister'
When we build an ACPI module which provides backlight
support we need to ensure that the backlight class
device is selected.
