Ok, tried 2.4.9. With 1 ioapic the machine boots just fine. With the 
second ioapic enabled the behavior I previously described still 
occurs.
attempting to Queue abort
aic7xxx_abort returns 8194
These are the only error messages I copied down, I believe that there 
was another, will reboot and check later.
