I just put util-linux-2.9v the usual places.
People complained that using *fdisk failed on 600 GB disks.
If I made no mistake cfdisk will now work up to 2 TB
(mainly by ignoring the kernel's answer to HDGETGEO).
Once 2 TB looked almost infinitely large, but today
100 GB is quite common, and we can expect that very soon
this 2 TB will be a real limit. In other words, this old
ugly DOS-type partition table will have to be replaced.
