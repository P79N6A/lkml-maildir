Hi,
These series of patches collapses all the vectored IO support into
single set of file-operation method using aio_read/aio_write. 
This work was originally suggested & started by Christoph Hellwig, 
when Zach Brown tried to add vectored support for AIO. 
Here is the summary:
[PATCH 1/3] Vectorize aio_read/aio_write methods
[PATCH 2/3] Remove readv/writev methods and use aio_read/aio_write
instead.
[PATCH 3/3] Zach's core aio changes to support vectored AIO.
BTW, Chuck Lever is actually re-arranging NFS DIO, AIO code to
fit into this model.
I ran various testing including LTP on this series. Andrew,
can you include these in -mm tree ?
Thanks,
Badari
