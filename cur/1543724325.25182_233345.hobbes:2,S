i've uploaded the -H3 patch against 2.6.7-vanilla to:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.7-vanilla-H3
(NOTE: this patch upgrades to Jens' latest version of cfq-iosched.c,
because one of the might_sleep() additions uncovered a bug there.)
i've done a quick testboot on x86, seems to work fine.
