I dunno, I can't possibly tell since you haven't given any info about
this crash. Where does it crash, do you have an oops? All I could say
from your report + patch is that it wasn't valid. There's just no way
for current->comm to be NULL, so your patch couldn't possibly have made
a difference.

It's best to keep the line as minimal as possible, count isn't really
very interesting. What is interesting is process, offset (for finding
the file, if you need to), and data direction.

2.4 stock doesn't have 64-bit sectors, please consult (again) the
canonical source (include file). There's no need to cast.
