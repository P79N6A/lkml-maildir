Allow me to point out that the original patch is Oliver's (although I
helped), and it doesn't need to go in -- it needs not to be removed.
Furthermore, I have better things to do with the next month of my time 
than auditing hundreds of routines I don't understand for behavior I 
probably won't be able to recognize.  (Although at 50 a day... hmmm, 
maybe.)
This sounds more like a job for kernel-janitors!

Very good points.  USB doesn't do anything like that either.  And right, 
it's okay for a method to destroy other devices; it just can't do anything 
that would lead to its own unregistration.
