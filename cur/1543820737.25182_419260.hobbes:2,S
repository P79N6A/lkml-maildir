No. As mentioned, as long as the target audience is distributions and 
library maintainers, I definitely think we should do help them as much as 
possible. Our problems have historically been "random people" who have 
/usr/include/linux being the symlink to "kernel source of the day", which 
is an unsupportable situation.
(And yes, for a short while back in the early nineties, that symlink was 
even the proper thing to do. But exactly because it's unsupportable, it 
pretty quickly got to be a "don't do that then", but I still occasionally 
hear from people who use bad distributions).
