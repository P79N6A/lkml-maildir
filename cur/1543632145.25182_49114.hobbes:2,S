Your division of categories (snipped from above quoted) seems ok.
The basic thing to remember is that "generic_foo" or "cpu_intel_foo" 
options should very rarely, if ever, appear in the config.in or sources. 
 We simply want to use the generic or cpu-specific user selection to 
determine (a) compiler flags, (b) CONFIG_xxx symbols for specific CPU 
features and optimizations, [like CONFIG_X86_F00F_BUG] and maybe (c) 
enable and disable CPU-specific drivers.  (c) will be a special case, 
since very few drivers should require a specific CPU type... but some 
drivers simply don't work on 386.
