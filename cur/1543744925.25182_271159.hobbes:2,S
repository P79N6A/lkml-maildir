Thanks, it works indeed.
But there is still something strange.
Previously, in 2.6.10-rc1 (and in -mm2
either I think) the NMI watchdog was
working in both LAPIC and IO-APIC modes.
Now - only in LAPIC mode.
nmi_watchdog=1 still doesn't work.
Any ideas about this?
Just trying to make sure that everything
is correct.
And btw, dmesg is still silent about a
LAPIC. This makes me nervous when I am
trying to figure out whether it works or
not:) Would be nice to get those prominent
messages back, as per 2.6.8.
