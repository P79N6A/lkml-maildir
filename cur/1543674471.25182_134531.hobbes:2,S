Here is a list of things we need to do on s390 for 2.6:
arch/s390/
~~~~~~~~~
o A nastly memory management problem causes random crashes.
  These appear to be fixed/hidden by the objrmap patch, more
  investigation is needed.
drivers/s390/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Early userspace and 64 bit dev_t will allow the removal of most of
  dasd_devmap.c and dasd_genhd.c.
o The 3270 console driver needs to be replaced with a working one
  (prototype is there, needs to be finished).
o Minor interface changes are pending in cio/ when the z990 machines
  are out.
There are some more things being worked on that are either post-2.6.0
or are likely to remain outside of the official kernel (i.e. not for
your list):
o Jan Glauber is working on a fix for the timer issues related
  to running on virtualized CPUs (wall-clock vs. cpu time).
o new zfcp fibre channel driver
o the qeth driver will become GPL soon
o a block device driver for ramdisks shared among virtual
  machines
o driver for crypto hardware
o 'claw' network device driver
