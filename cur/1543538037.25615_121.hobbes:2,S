here i'm talking about the non exec stack issue,
as Victor said, just consult Lkml archives (the thread
about LUID, and Security in general ) and you'll see explaination
why this is not usefull in order to prevent stack overflow.

In vast majority, it append scheduling call all over the place.

I know that and this is true, but here, i'm talking about non exec stack issue
( you just have to find the system() system call vector and pass whatever
 string to it (see the thread for more detail) ).
