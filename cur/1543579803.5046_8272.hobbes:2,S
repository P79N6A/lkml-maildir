PAT is basically the MTRR memory types on a per-page basis.  It adds a
new flag bit to the x86 page table entry, then that bit together with
the PCD and PWT bits is used to do a look-up in an 8-entry table that
gives the effective memory type (the table is set through an MSR).
All the details are in the Intel x86 manual, volume 3
<URL:
http://developer.intel.com/design/pentium4/manuals/>
 (at the end
of chapter 9).
Quite a lot of the x86 CPUs out there support PAT: The PII except the
first couple of models, the Celeron except the first model, the PIII,
all PII and PIII Xeons, the P4, all AMD K7 models.  I'm guessing, but
I suspect that the majority of x86 CPUs supporting write combining in
any form that have been made also support PAT.
I wish Intel had put PAT in the PPro, rather than messing everyone
around with MTRRs (MTRRs are good for BIOS writers, but a pain for
everyone else).
