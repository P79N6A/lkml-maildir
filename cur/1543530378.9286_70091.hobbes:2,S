	It might be interesting to see if I can find a machine to try
and see if I can see what it thinks it is sending out.
	The one machine I can think of that I have root access on that
is not behind a bizarro firewall and not on my local net doesn't seem to
exhibit the problem. It is a solaris 2.6 (with suggested patches) machine.

	Gregory Maxwell <greg@linuxpower.cx> had the most helpful suggestion of
turning off timestamps by doing:
echo -n 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_timestamps
	which worked like a charm, as you might imagine. Much faster than
my old sparc ever was :-)

	No, nothing funky at all. Yes, the errors counter does increase.
