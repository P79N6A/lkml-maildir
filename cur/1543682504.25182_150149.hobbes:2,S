This makes no difference to the kernel. Splitting PPro would only make
sense for one reason. The Pentium Pro needs store barriers on
spin_unlock and friends, the PII and later do not. However if this was
done you'd also want to check for PPro boots with a PII kernel and panic
which isn't currently done
