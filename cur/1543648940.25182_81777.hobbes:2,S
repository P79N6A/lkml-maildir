Have you considered putting a fixed upper bound on the number of pages
tables a page can be mapped into?  This would result in the same amount
of memory reduction, with what should be very little complexity.
I admit there would be a few more demand paging hits, but they should be
controllable.  And I suspect their performance impact would be lost
in the noise.
