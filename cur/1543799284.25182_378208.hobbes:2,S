Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Patch set to abstract portions of the MSI core so that it can be used on
architectures which don't use standard interrupt controllers.
1/4 msi-arch-init.patch
	Add an msi_arch_init() hook which can be used to perform platform
	specific setup prior to msi use.
2/4 msi-callouts.patch
	Define a set of callouts to implement the platform-specific tasks:
	msi_setup - set up plumbing to get a vector directed at a default
	    cpu, and return the corresponding MSI bus address and data.
	msi_teardown - inverse of msi_setup
	msi_target - retarget a vector to a given cpu
	Define the routine msi_register_callouts() which can be called from
	a platform's msi_arch_init() code to override the generic callouts.
3/4 ia64-per-platform-device-vector.patch
	For the ia64 arch, allow per-platform definitions of
	IA64_FIRST_DEVICE_VECTOR and IA64_LAST_DEVICE_VECTOR.
4/4 msi-altix.patch 
	Altix specific callouts to implement MSI.
