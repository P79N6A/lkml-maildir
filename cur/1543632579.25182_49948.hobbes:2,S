I've been really really happy with spamassassin (www.spamassissin.org)
for my personal inbox.  It's been blocking about 90+% of the spam
right out of the box, and only three or four false positives.  
It's nice since it pre-filters SPAM out, so you can handle the rejects
at your leisure, and not have to deal with them randomly.  I've been
very happy with it, and only after a week of use.
I've average around 20-40 spam a-day, so it's made a measureable
difference.
