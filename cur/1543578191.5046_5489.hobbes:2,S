Hi.
I have updated my patch for drivers/net/rcpci45.c to 2.4.0. It can
be found at www.jaquet.dk/kernel/patches/rcpci.patch.gz. Besides
being rediffed it sports some more resource checks compared to the
last one (mentioned in http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&
m=97743837428000&w=2).
If somebody would like me to split this up for easier digestion/
acceptance I am willing to do so. Especially if a magic incantation
on how to split a large diff up into smaller (but line-number wise
interwoven) diffs were provided.
