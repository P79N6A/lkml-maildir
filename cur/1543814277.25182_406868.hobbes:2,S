Nathan's problem is different, its nothing related to this thread.
Appears that a PIII box had trouble to bring a CPU back online after it was
just offlined. Iam not able to reproduce it with the systems i have here.
I have tried a PIII box itself, and also a x86_64 system booting a i386 kernel
and all seems to work ok.
Zwane was attempting to trace Nathan's issue with some experimental patches
but dont think it went far along yet.

It might help to post with the actual warning, so we can understand why this
fix is necessary.
