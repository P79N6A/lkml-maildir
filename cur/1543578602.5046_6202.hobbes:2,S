Well, that's the part where it is really easy to cause crc errors. But I
believe I got that right in the driver. Tested successfully on many VIA
chipsets.

Also it should be noted that they don't cause any corruption (*). The worst
thing they can do is disabling DMA if they happen many times in a short
period of time. 
(*) - UDMA modes only. CRC errors are a big problem in PIO and
      MWDMA/SWDMA modes.

... note that he says 40pin, 80wire. That's the correct UDMA66 cable, it
has just 40 pins.

Bad trace on the motherboard is what I suspect on KT7's. It could be
designed a little longer or shorter than the others and a marginal clock
skew can cause the crc errors. Or the trace can lead too close to some
source of e/m noise.

The software retries the transfer, the hardware just aborts. But it's
safe, anyways.
