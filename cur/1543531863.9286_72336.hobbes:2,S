Thanks.
This afternoon I have played a bit with READ_NATIVE_MAX_ADDRESS
and SET_MAX_ADDRESS, and find for my 36.5 GB Maxtor the following:
(i) READ_NATIVE_MAX_ADDRESS works
[In CHS mode I get #cylinders mod 65536, in LBA mode the correct answer.]
(ii) SET_MAX_ADDRESS works whenever I want to set the max address
to anything at least 255 sectors from the end. So, as soon as I
have used SET_MAX_ADDRESS, 255 sectors or 130kB is gone.
A reboot does not suffice to get this back, but after a power cycle
the disk has full capacity again.
(I wonder whether this is a bug. The way I read the ATA-5 spec
it should be possible to do SET_MAX_ADDRESS to the address
gotten back from READ_NATIVE_MAX_ADDRESS.)
A side effect of SET_MAX_ADDRESS is that the current geometry
is reset to 16383/16/63.
