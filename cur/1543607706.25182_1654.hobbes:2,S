I'm using this archive:
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/index.html
and nowhere can i find the thread you mentioned.
Also, this motherboard works *perfect* in windows (which is 
unfortunately where i've been stuck) -- it hasnt crashed in the last 
several weeks i've been using it! (probably the longest uptime i've ever 
seen for a windows machine that's actually being used)  So I *seriously* 
doubt its bad hardware.
Can  you maybe give me a link to the thread you mention?
