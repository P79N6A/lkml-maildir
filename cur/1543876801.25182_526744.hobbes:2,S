This is not today's situation.  Yes, 10 years ago when I added the
support to glibc it wasn't much of a problem.  But times change.  As I
said before in this thread, OpenMP by default scales the number of
threads used for a parallel loops depending on the number of available
processors/cores and therefore the number must be retrieved every time
(with perhaps minimal caching of a few secs, but this requires
gettimeofday calls...).  All of a sudden this is not micro benchmark
anymore.  It's a real issue which we only became aware of because it is
noticeable in real life.
