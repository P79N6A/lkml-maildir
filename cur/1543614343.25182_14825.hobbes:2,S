Well that is a design flaw in the general FS models from the beginning,
and it should be fixed.  I recall everyone drum banging SCSI because it
could hand this problem, and surprize it fails too.  So it come back to
the FS being responsible to force the completetion of it requests
regardless of the overhead.

Now that is a sensible solution, but I do not know if it would work in all
cases or how best it should be handled.  Regardless, the responsiblity of
the content is primarily the FS.  Should an APP close a file but it is
still in buffer_cache, there is no way to notify the app or the user or
anything associated with the creation/closing of that file, if a write
error occurs.
So we have user-space believing it is success.
FS doing an initial ACK of success.
BLOCK generating the request to the low_level.
LOW_LEVEL goes OH CRAP, I am having a problem and can not complete.
LOW_LEVEL goes, HEY BLOCK we have a problem.
BLOCK, that is nice whatever ....
This is a bad model, an worse is
LOW_LEVEL goes, HEY BLOCK we have a problem.
BLOCK goes, HEY FS we have an annoying LOW_LEVEL asking for reissue.
FS, duh which way did the rabbit go ...
So what is the right answer, 'cause blackholing the file is wrong, and I
do not see a way for it to be reissued.  We should note the kernel now
owns the responsiblity of completion in this case; regardless, what other
think.

Well managing badblock can be a major pain, but it is the right thing to
do.  Now what is the cost, since there is surge in journaling FS's that
have logs.  The cost is coming up w/ a sane way to manage the mess.
Even before we get to managing the mess, we have to be able to reissue the
request to a reallocated location, and make all kinds of noise that we are
doing heroic attempts to save the data.  These may include --
	periodic message bombing the open terminals.
	clearing all outstanding requests, and making RO (caution /)
The issue is we are doing nothing to address the point, and it is arrogant
for the maintainers of the various storage classes and the supported upper
layers not willing to address this issue.
This reply may seem a little fragmented because I had to answer it is
stages between distractions.
