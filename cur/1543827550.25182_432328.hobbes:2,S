Indeed. Unfortunately, adjusting VMSPLIT appeared to break the assumptions 
of some programs like Valgrind (and hence caused a regression for some 
users). VMSPLIT was thusly "hidden" under CONFIG_EMBEDDED such that the only
people who would be inclined to mess with the setting were people already tinkering 
with "low-level" settings if you will.
