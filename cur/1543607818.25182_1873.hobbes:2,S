Yes, I'd agree that the driver should ignore random signals.
The kernel thread should only allow itself to be terminated
via the driver's close() method.
An obvious approach is to change rtl8139_close() to do:
	tp->diediedie = 1;
	wmb();
	ret = kill_proc(...);
and test the flag in rtl8139_thread().
The tricky part is teaching the thread to ignore the
spurious signals - the signal_pending() state needs to be
cleared.  I think flush_signals() is the way to do this.
See context_thread() for an example.
           spin_lock_irq(&curtask->sigmask_lock);
           flush_signals(curtask);
           recalc_sigpending(curtask);
           spin_unlock_irq(&curtask->sigmask_lock);
The recalc_sigpending() here appears to be unnecessary...
The kernel thread in 8139too has certainly been an interesting
learning exercise :)  Using signals and task management in-kernel
is full of pitfalls.  In retrospect, probably it should have used
waitqueues directly.
