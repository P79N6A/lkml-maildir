OK, I tried all these pci= options, plus acpi=off, to no effect:
conf1, conf2, nommconf, biosirq, noacpi, routeirq, nosort, rom,
lastbus=2, assign-busses, usepirqmask acpi=off
Also tried adjusting PCIe-related stuff in the BIOS (underclocking PCIe
from 100 to 70 and adjusting Northbridge options). No change.
Unfortunately this is the only PCIe card I have (my video is a AGP
Radeon 9200). Do I need to force this card to be enabled somehow with a
setpci command?
