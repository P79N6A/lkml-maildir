Good catch, however I disagree with the fix.  It makes the code more
brittle.
It's not a good idea to reuse a variable for some other purpose just
because you "know" the original use is dead. Things don't necessarily
stay dead; code moves around.
Could you prepare a revised version of this patch, that instead of
dropping that declaration of 'p', rather renames it to 'q' ?
Thanks.
