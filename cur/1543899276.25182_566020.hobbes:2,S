Some comments on the code:
1. random() is counted in cycle_per_iter, which can skew the results.
You could pre-compute the random addresses and store them in an array.
Then, during the actual timing, walk the array:
index = 0;
for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++)
      index = *(int *)(array + index * CACHE_LINE_SIZE);
2. You may want to flush the cache before the timing starts.
3. You want to access memory at the cache-line granularity to avoid
addresses falling into the same line (and thus unwanted hits).
If you do these, I expect you'll get a higher memory latency.
