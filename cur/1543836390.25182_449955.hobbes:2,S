You are starting with the last step.
First, get your Elevator I/O scheduler reviewed [1] and show some data 
that backs your "it should be superceeded by the Elevator I/O scheduler" 
claim.
Then get your Elevator I/O scheduler included in Linus' tree.
Then you might perhaps schedule the Deadline I/O scheduler for removal.

[1] that's essentially what is done by your second patch
-- 
    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
