ah! Besides OpenGL behavior and app startup performance i didnt 
originally have Xorg in mind with this change, but thinking about it, 
precise load calculations and load smoothing does have a positive effect 
on 'coupled' workloads where under the previous variant of CFS's load 
calculation one task component of the workload could become 'invisible' 
to another task and hence cause macro-scale scheduling artifacts not 
expected by humans. With smoothing these are dealt with more 
consistently. Xorg can be a quite strongly coupled workload.

yeah, make -jN workloads (and any mixture of non-identical scheduling 
patterns, which most real workloads consist of) should be handled more 
consistently too by -v8.
so your workload (and Gene's workload) were the ones in fact that i had 
hoped not to _hurt_ with -v8 (neither of you being the hardcore gamer 
type ;), and in reality -v8 ended up helping them too. These sorts of 
side-effects are always welcome ;-)
