The highlights of this release are:
- White paper titled "Analysis of Linux Test Projects Kernel Code
  Coverage"
  This analysis paper aims at identifying areas in the kernel that are
  currently tested by LTP and also identify areas that require attention.

http://ltp.sf.net/coverage/index.html.
  Provides a testcase for each kernel source file mapping.
- LTP is available in i386 binary RPM format for download. Also, the LTP
  source RPM and spec file are available for download to allow binary RPM
  builds.
- Linux Test Tools Table. A comprehensive list of tools and testsuites
  available to test Linux.
- MIPS, s390 and 64-bit x86 updates.
We encourage the community to post results, patches or new tests on
