Mine works fine with 1.4 (even though the kernel reports 1.1 - I've even
checked with "mptable" - still 1.1 - maybe the BIOS just doesn't set the
correct info?). I don't however use USB (and if I did want to I would
upgrade to the latest 2.5c(?) bios which does apparently work for USB 
and ACPI under Win2k).
