For most 64-bit systems, sure.  For amd64 it's a little different
because there are additional changes to the architecture (as compared to
ia32/x86) which can more than make up for the difference for many
applications.  Then there's also things like encryption (postfix/tls,
apache/ssl, etc) which can benefit greatly from better handling of
64bit (and larger) types.
So, basically, it's not nearly so clear-cut as you portray it. :)

The differences between a 64bit sparc chip in 32bit and 64bit are quite
a bit less than the differences between an amd64 chip in 32bit and
64bit.  Thus, this makes alot more sense for sparc.

Perhaps on sparc or mips; it's much less clear-cut on amd64.
