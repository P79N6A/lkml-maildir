AS Chuck explained, this is motivated by the perfmon patch. We need to save
and restore the performance counters on context switch. We do it only for
the tasks that use them. As such, this is yet another optional work that
needs to be checked in __switch_to(). You have to test it for both
the outgoing and incoming tasks. Andi suggested that instead of adding yet
another test and touch yet another pair of cachelines, we pack all the
'extra' work into a single bitfield per task. This way the number of cachelines
touched is limited to two for the debug registers, I/O bitmap and later perfmon.
I leveraged the TIF mechanism for this as it seemed quite appropriate.
As you point out, it adds a little bit of complexity in that you need to
ensure that when you touch the debug registers and/or the I/O bitmap, we keep
the TIF flags in sync. The patch I submitted ensures that. The good thing
is that, for both, the number of places were they are activated/stopped is very
limited.
