Haven't thought about it all much.  Have spent most of my time in the last
month admiring the contents of kernel bugzilla, and the ongoing attempts to
increase them.

I agree that lots of people would like the functionality.  I regret that
although it appears that v9fs could provide it, there seems to be no
interest in working on that.
The main sticking point with FUSE remains the permission tricks around
fuse_allow_task().  AFAIK it remains the case that nobody has come up with
any better idea, so I'm inclined to merge the thing.
