I have such a thing queued too, for the lock bitops patches for when 2.6.24
opens, Andrew promises me :).
I guess they should be identical, except I don't like doing trylock_page in
place of SetPageLocked, for memory ordering performance and aesthetic
reasons... I've got an init_page_locked (or set_page_locked... I can't
remember, the patch is at home).
Fine idea to lockdep the page lock, anyway. Does it show up any of the
buffered write deadlock possibilities? :)
buffer lock is another notable bit-mutex that might be converted (I have
the patch to do the similar nice !tas->trylock conversion for that too). I
think it is used widely enough by tricky code that it would be useful to
annotate as well.
Unfortunately we can't convert bit_spinlock.h easily, I guess?
