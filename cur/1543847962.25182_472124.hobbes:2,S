This removes support for boot loaders that did not understand boot 
loader protocol version 2.00 or later.  This probably includes very 
early versions of LILO as well as the long-since obsolete Bootlin and 
Shoelace.  Those loaders were unable to load bzImages as well.
I have been urging that we kill zImage for a long time.  It is virtually 
impossible to build a kernel today that will fit inside the zImage 512K 
compressed limitation.
It would be useful for setup.S to halt with a message if such an early 
bootloader is detected, however.  This would have to be parked in the 
first 2K of the setup area, and can simply be detected by looking for 
zero in type_of_loader.
