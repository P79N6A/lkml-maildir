Yes, I have at least reproduced the libfs leak.
The situation is when you write into a !uptodate page, the prepare_write
function runs SetPageUptodate *before* we have copied data in. Thus you
can read uninitialised data out of there.
SetPageUptodate must not be used (or at least used carefully) in
prepare_write. commit_write is the correct place to do this.

If doing a partial-write, simply clear the whole page and set it uptodate
(don't need to get too tricky). If doing a full-write, only set it uptodate
in the commit_write.

OK, similar problem here - we have brought all the buffers uptodate
that we are *not* going to write over, or partially write over, but
we can have an uninitialised hole over the region we want to write.
I think just setting page uptodate in commit_write might do the
trick? (and getting rid of the set_page_dirty there).
