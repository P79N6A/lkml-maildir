OK.  We have:
with partial .config:
# CONFIG_WAN is not set
CONFIG_HDLC=m
# CONFIG_HDLC_RAW is not set
# CONFIG_HDLC_RAW_ETH is not set
# CONFIG_HDLC_CISCO is not set
# CONFIG_HDLC_FR is not set
# CONFIG_HDLC_PPP is not set
...
CONFIG_SYNCLINK=m
CONFIG_SYNCLINK_HDLC=y
CONFIG_SYNCLINKMP=m
CONFIG_SYNCLINKMP_HDLC=y
CONFIG_SYNCLINK_GT=m
CONFIG_SYNCLINK_GT_HDLC=y
CONFIG_N_HDLC=m
and still get missing/unresolved symbols...
