First off, I hope you are testing with 2.6.12 or so.  There are some
patches to handle the auto-negotiation that went in 2.6.11 or 2.6.12 and
they SHOULD be handling those cases better though it is certainly
possible that they don't work as well as they should.  In some of my
testing, I was finding that I only really got the LPA from
autonegotiation on the first connect.  Subsequent ones always returned
the same values, even if I connected into a 10mb hub or the like.  I
haven't been able to determine if that is a shortcoming in the device or
not.
