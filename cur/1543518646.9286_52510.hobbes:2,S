It gives a large speedup to a loop test as I showed. Our database tests
show about a 5% speedup. There are other issues that we haven't quite
figured out... Depending on the disk driver, you may not get the speedup.
I'm kind of baffled by this... since it is page aligned, etc.
So in short, the concept looks like it has benefit, the implementation
is the question. This one works, but since Linus doesn't like this method, 
we'll take a look at trying it another way.
