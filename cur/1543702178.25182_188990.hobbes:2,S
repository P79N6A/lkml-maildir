    Didn't thought about attenuation :(( My cable is almost 5ft (1.5
metres more or less), and maybe is too long for the printer :??

    By now I'm using the parallel interface, and I won't use USB
again until I get a new cable and test the latest stable 2.4.x If I
get this to work I'll tell here.
    Thanks :)
