Well, apart from the fact that a lot of machines don't even _have_
serial ports..
I dunno. I might even be willing to apply kgdb patches to my tree if it
just could use the regular network card I already have connected on all
my machines. None of my laptops have a serial line, for example, but
they all have networking.
Soon even _desktops_ probably won't have serial lines any more, only USB.
