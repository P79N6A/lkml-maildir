He He ... and they try to "get even", too! --Not by fixing bugs,
but by "reporting" "stupid" clients to their bosses. That's why
I have the only remaining Sun in the company. I was too lazy
to turn it back on after a power failure a couple of years ago.
Therefore, I didn't report any problems to Sun...and got to
keep the machine.
