this is plainly not the case. Look at eg. the net_tx_action() lock-break
i did in the -I1 patch. There we first create a private queue which we
work down. With my approach we can freely reschedule _within the loop_.
With your suggestion this is not possible.
i.e. executing a softirq in a process context gives us all the
advantages of a process context: all the local state is saved and
preserved until the preemption is done. These advantages are not there
for either immediate or idle-task-only-immediate type of softirq
processing.
