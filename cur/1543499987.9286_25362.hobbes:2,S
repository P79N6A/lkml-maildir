Subject: Bug in nfs in kernel 2.2.10 ?

Hi,
i was happy running Linux on two machines ( one exports home
directories to the other through nfs ) until today....
Today i installed kernel 2.2.10 on my client and troubles started.
Here's the configuration :
both client & server are AMD 400Mhz with 128MB RAM.
My home directory is nfs mounted from the server.
Each time i'm trying to use netscape to send and email , the netscape
process goes into uninterruptible sleep, wating for disk io to complete
... and never wakes up. This is 100% reproducible ( even after client
reboot and nfs server restart ).
It happens ( up to now ) only with netscape when opening a mail composer,
not when reading or deleting messages ...
Here are some evidences i found :

--- Now let's go to the nfs server ----
rlogin server
[charlus@server charlus]$ uname -a

/usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd -v
Universal NFS Server 2.2beta37
nothing special in /var/log/messages
--------back to the client----------------
On the client, i found this on /var/log/messages 
Jun 21 18:59:19 charles kernel: RPC: doubly enqueued task! 
Jun 21 18:59:19 charles kernel: RPC: failed to add task to queue: error: -11! 
Jun 21 18:59:19 charles kernel: lockd: couldn't bind to server 192.168.0.2 - giving up. 
Jun 21 18:59:19 charles kernel: RPC: task of released request still queued! 
Jun 21 18:59:19 charles kernel: RPC: (task is on xprt_pending) 
any idea ?
thanks a lot.
