Some things I'd like to see (as I am currently using the KIO
equivalent) implemented as FUSE fs:
- "fish", virtual file access over ssh
This is already available here: 
  
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse
You need to dowload fuse-2.2-pre3 and sshfs-1.0.  It should work on
any kernel including the 2.6.10-rc1-mm1 with FUSE compiled in.
