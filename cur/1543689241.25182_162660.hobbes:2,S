I think he said he was doing DSP... there's a trick of double mapping
the same memory to save one subscript calculation in FFT (or maybe DFT)
inner loop. The only reason I know this is that a friend did a master's
thesis on DSP about 20 years ago, and I absorbed some info I hope to
never need. He also coded an FFT instruction in the LCS (programmable
firmware) of a VAX.
I am only speculating, of course.
