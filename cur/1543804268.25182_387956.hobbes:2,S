It's not a "latency": As far as I can tell, interrupts or preemption
are not disabled, the latency tracer doesn't show anything.
I just noticed that low-pri rt processes did not get scheduled for
about 500 microseconds when e100 was active (even if the net was
idle), and that there were no such breaks with eepro100.
I didn't analyze it in detail at that time, I believed that the e100
interrupt handler thread was running every 2 seconds for 500 
microseconds, because the interrupt count of eth0 incremented every
2 seconds, exactly when my rt processes paused.
This would be bad: That irq thread is at rt prio 47 on my system, 
above many importent things.
However, I checked more closely now, and found out that only a small
portion of the 500 microseconds is spent in the irq thread. Most of
it is spent in the timer thread, at rt prio 1, so the whole thing
is a much smaller problem than I originally believed.
Must be the function e100_watchdog.

See my other reply: I didn't notice that eepro100 is to be removed,
and as long as eepro100 was there, it was no problem for me.
