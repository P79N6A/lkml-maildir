Hmm, I think I just thought of a use for the tree quota concept.
Lets say that you have about 50GB of space, but you only want to allow 20GB
for a certain tree (possibly mp3s), and you want to keep user ownerships of
the files they contribute.
Now try to use the group quota idea.
User makes mp3
user can chgrp to any user that they are a member of...
copy to /mp3s.
Now the group (and quota) that was setup for mp3s has been circumvented.
With the tree quota, an entire tree could be assigned to a certain group,
and then use the group quota tools...
The only other way I can see to fix this would be a cron job to walk the
tree and set the group to whatever has been setup, but that looks like a
hack to me.
Is there another way to fix this besides putting all mp3s on a separate
partition?
