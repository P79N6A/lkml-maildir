How about this instead:
Arch-indepedent parts:
----------------------
include/linux/ipipe.h
kernel/ipipe/Kconfig      (formerly ipipe/Kconfig)
kernel/ipipe/Makefile     (formerly ipipe/Makefile)
kernel/ipipe/core.c       (formerly kernel/ipipe.c)
kernel/ipipe/generic.c    (formerly ipipe/generi.c)
Arch-dependent parts:
---------------------
include/asm-i386/ipipe.h
arch/i386/kernel/ipipe-core.c  (formerly arch/i386/kernel/ipipe.c)
arch/i386/kernel/ipipe-root.c  (formerly ipipe/x86.c)
Seems to me that the above makes more sense. Albeit you would have
parts of the module in kernel/ipipe/* and the rest in
arch/*/kernel/ipipe*.
