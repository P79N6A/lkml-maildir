The arch/ia64/lib/memcpy.S is probably fine, it must be gcc doing
an inline substitution of a well-known function.
A commenter on my blog mentioned seeing the same thing in the past.

It's possible that applying (void *) cast to the first argument of memcpy
would disrupt this optimization. But since we have a well understood
patch by Erik, which only adds a penalty of 32 bytes of stack waste
and 32 bytes of memcpy, I thought it best not to bother with heaping
workarounds.
