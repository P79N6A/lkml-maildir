The LVM2 sofware no longer uses a particular driver which is just
usable for its own purpose.
It rather accesses a different, so-called 'device-mapper' driver, which
implements a generic volume management service for the Linux kernel by
supporting arbitray mappings of address ranges to underlying block devices.
Because this is a generic service rather than an application within the kernel,
it is open to be used by multiple LVM implementations (for eg. EVMS could be
ported to use it :-)
The device-mapper driver is under the GPL and our Beta1 release dated Wednesday,
which included the LVM2 tools as well, supports 2.4 kernels. We are aiming to
get it integrated into the stock kernel and are implementing the necessary
changes (bio interface) for 2.5 now.
We released a device-mapper library (implements a generic API for the
device-mapper) which is under the LGPL with it.
The LVM2 tools have a library with routines to for eg. access the
device-mapper library, deal with LVM metadata (VGDA), support different
metadata formats and offer configuration file support which is under the
LGPL as well.
The tools themselves (vgcreate, lvcreate, ...) are under the GPL.
IOW:
GPL				LGPL
