Subject: Re: [PATCH] reserve end-of-conventional-memory to 1MB, 64-bit, use paravirt_enabled

Jeremy Fitzhardinge pointed out that looking at the boot_params
struct to determine if the system is running in a paravirtual
environment is not reliable for the Xen case, currently. He also
points out that there already exists a function to determine if
the system is running in a paravirtual environment. So let's use
that instead. This gets rid of the preprocessor test too.

Same, for 64 bit.
