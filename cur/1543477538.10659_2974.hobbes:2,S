hello,
	sounds like a good idea to me.  If somebody would like
to give me a pointer to a place which contains a quick summary 
of bug fixes, and particularly new features, I'll get started.  If someone
else has already started this then let me know how I can help. (proof
reading maybe?). We probably need to decide on a word limit to 
begin with.  I think it would be best if the actual announcement 
came from Linus personally.
cheers
Greg Smart
