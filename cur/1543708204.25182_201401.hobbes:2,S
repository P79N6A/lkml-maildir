The Tyan K8W S-2885ANRF (a dual Opteron board) has:
One 8X AGP / AGP Pro110 slot
Two independent PCI-X buses
Two 64-bit 100/66/33 MHz (3.3-Volt)
Two 64-bit 133/100/66/33 MHz (3.3-Volt)
One legacy 32-bit 33MHz (5-Volt) PCI slot
This is the board I've ordered in my new workstation. I've heard that 
people have used this board quite successfully with Linux (fingers crossed).
