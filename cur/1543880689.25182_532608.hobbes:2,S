I applied already the patches I thought were appropriate,
you had some crypto layer changes that you need to work
out with Herbert Xu before the rest can be applied.
Let me know what the status is of that stuff.
Either way, I don't think it should block Eric's work here.
If his stuff is more ready first, it should go in and then
you have a little bit of patch merging to do that's all.
