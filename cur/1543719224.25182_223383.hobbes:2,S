The patch looks OK to me, though the final call is up to Bart.
FWIW, when you included the patch inline, your email editor word-wrapped 
it so it will not apply.
If Microsoft Outlook (or whatever) cannot produce decent patches, you 
may need to include your patches _twice_ -- once in plaintext (with 
annoying word wrap) for review, and once as you did initially, as a 
base64 attachment.
Most MUA's are able to attach patches as plaintext (not base64), so see 
if there are setting you can flip...
