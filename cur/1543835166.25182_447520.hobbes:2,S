Performance.  If your plugin is performance valuing, it needs to be in
kernel.   Also, FUSE does not have per-file plugins (correct me if I err
here).  It would be nice to see it pay attention to reiser4 pluginids,
and thus become per-file.
Thanks for your other words, which I will not comment on because I agree
with them.;-)
