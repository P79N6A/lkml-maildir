I'm not really keen - it sometimes get's invoked here and by others in a
sysrq-s sysrq-u sysrq-b sequence (sync, unmount, reboot) in a context
where things have gone south (particularly if there's some process
stuck). In that context it helps make filesystems cleaner than they'd
otherwise be, and the fact that writers might still be in progress is
irrelevant because the next keypress is going to reboot anyway.
Ok. I'll admit to being a heretic ext3 user, loving not having to fsck
after the above and still getting zero corruption as a result.
Regards,
Nigel
