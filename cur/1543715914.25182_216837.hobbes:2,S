I think it is a really minor problem, comparing to others we sometimes
have. It has many solutions, for example, we can create
native device nodes in /dev/evms (or map on top of partitions).
There's a reason why this problem never arised before in such manner.
Traditional evms audience is server admins, and most of them configure
their boxes that disks other than with they /dev/root are
"evms-native" in some manner, and excluding their /dev/sda from evms
scan.
So for now, correct solution would be correct exclude device list, and
maybe distributions shipping evms will do this.
