Sure this is a race and not a birthday paradox? How recent is this?
Possibly before locking was added to random.c?

Ok, the lock contention would be with add_entropy_words. I've got code
that reduces calls to SHATransform for /dev/urandom, but it require
addressing the starvation issues between /dev/random and /dev/urandom first.
