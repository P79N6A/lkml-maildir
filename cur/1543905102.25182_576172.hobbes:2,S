Hi, Igno.
Sorry for so long response, I hadn't opportunity to reboot machine for
new kernel.
I've built 2.6.22 with CONFIG_HZ_1000 and CONFIG_PREEMPT - nothing changed =(.
Interesting that in Totem(Gnome vp) sound isn't interrupting during
video watching.
I'll try other kernels later to find out what is working good for my case.
In gxine(xine-based) sound is interrupting too!

I'm not using amarok but audacious. It's seems that's everything is
alright with it.
I'll send more tests results later.
Best wishes!
