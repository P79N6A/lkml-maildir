First a quick question: how would you rate your C knowledge? Did you
ever write a program yourself? 
My proposal assumes that you have at least basic C knowledge.

It's probably better to only do that on files which you can easily compile.
For ARM you would need a cross compiler.

In this case it would be better to just put the unlock_kernel() directly
before the single return. You only need to sprinkle them all over when
the function has multiple returns. Or then change the flow to only
have a single return, but that would be slightly advanced.

No the lock_kernel() of course has to be in the function, not in the structure
definition which does not contain any code.
Also the _operations structure stays the same (except for .ioctl -> .unlocked_ioctl); 
only the the ioctl function prototype changes.
> Am I'm working in the right direction or should I completely redo the patch?
I would suggest to only work on files that compile. e.g. do a
make allyesconfig
make -j$[$(grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo)*2] &1 |tee LOG             (will probably take a long time) 
first and then only modify files when are mentioned in "LOG"
