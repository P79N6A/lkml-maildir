A few things happened:
	- the devfs maintainer/author disappeared and stoped maintaining
	  the code.
	- devfs was found to have unfixable bugs
	- it was determined that the same thing could be done in
	  userspace (like udev.)

I didn't send that patch to the kernel to mark devfs as such.
Actually devfs is still very much "experimental" and "proof-of-concept"
if you have ever looked at it's code :)

Like what?  Anything that shows up in sysfs, udev will handle.  It's
only a matter of getting everything to show up in sysfs now...  It's
almost all there.

devfs's naming scheme could easily be changed?  Hahaha...
udev will be a major factor of improvement for changable naming schemes.
Please read the OLS paper for more details.
