(I should warn that this is on vmware - I don't dare to boot 2.5 on bare
metal yet).
I do have ramdisk mounted:
/dev/ram0 /mounts ext2 rw 0 0
but I haven't used it much at all. I'm not sure howto tell if ramdisk
triggered the problem. I will boot without it and see if it happens again,
but that won't tell for sure if it was ramdisk or not.
Root fs is ext2 on /dev/sda1.
