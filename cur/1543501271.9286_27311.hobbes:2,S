I had a Cyrix CPU some time back that had a *very* similar problem.  I
believe it was running 2.0.36.  Anyway, it worked absolutely fine, until
one day I built EGCS.  This binary would, about 1/3 of the time, crash. 
Poking around with a debugger showed that the instruction on which it
crashed was an access to a perfectly valid address (according to
/proc/xx/maps).  Swapping in a different CPU (I think it was an Intel
Pentium) fixed it.  ISTR it also could be fixed by turning off the L1
cache or something equally unacceptable performance-wise.
Here is its /proc/cpuinfo.  It was a 110 MHz (aka "133+") 6x86.
processor       : 0
cpu             : 586
model           : 6x86
vendor_id       : CyrixInstead
stepping        : 2.5, core/bus clock ratio: 2x
fdiv_bug        : no
hlt_bug         : no
f00f_bug        : no
fpu             : yes
fpu_exception   : yes
cpuid           : yes
wp              : yes
flags           : fpu
bogomips        : 110.18
In short, I think the CPU may well be a reasonable suspect.  I'd suggest
replacing it, if you can beg, borrow, or steal another (a different
brand might be wise), and see if there is any change.
HTH,
