Not entirely true.  You could do everything in user space except online 
resize of raid0/4/5 arrays, that requires specific support in the md 
modules and it begs for integration between LVM and MD since the MD is 
what has to resize the underlying device yet it's the LVM that usually 
handles filesystem resizing.
