	It's a SuSv2 thing:
"Upon successful completion with size not equal to 0, malloc() returns a
pointer to the allocated space. If size is 0, either a null pointer or a
unique pointer that can be successfully passed to free() will be returned.
Otherwise, it returns a null pointer and sets errno to indicate the error."
