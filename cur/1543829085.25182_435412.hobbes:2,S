Btw, I get
  119 files changed, 3888 insertions(+), 2159 deletions(-)
Why? Becuause my default pull script has rename detection enabled, and I 
get:
 rename include/linux/{usb_cdc.h => usb/cdc.h} (100%)
 rename include/linux/{usb_input.h => usb/input.h} (100%)
 rename include/linux/{usb_isp116x.h => usb/isp116x.h} (100%)
 rename include/linux/{usb_sl811.h => usb/sl811.h} (71%)
which explains the off-by-four number (and the smaller number of 
lines changed).
Just out of interest, could you enable that in your scripts too, so that 
renames don't show up as huge deletes/creates (well, in this case, thet 
were pretty small files, but you get the idea)?
