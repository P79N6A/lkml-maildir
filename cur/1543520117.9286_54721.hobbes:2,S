Well, why cant we enforce memory limits on a per user basis? Certainly, a
user doesnt, or shouldnt need 90% of the total resources of a machine.
Maybe there should be a memd that watches memory usage and deals with the
problem. The simplest solution would be for memd to notify the console of
the problem and let root deal with it.  Alternatively, I suppose that memd
could just gracefully kill the offending process(es). 
Lets say I do something stupid like write an infinite fork while I'm in
userland. Why cant a daemon notice that user person is being a memory hog
and kill off his biggest process? 
Of course, something like a memd might be a substantial performance hit
also.
How do other unix oess handle this one?
