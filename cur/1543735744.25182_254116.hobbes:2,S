Well this was only a direct macro removal, I'm contemplating removing the
counters as to be honest I'm not sure any drm developer as actually used
them since day one .. (and maybe not even then)... but I'll leave that for
another time, as there might be a wierd use of them somewhere...
Once I drop the ioctl macro, I'll probably start going back to see what
stuff is probably not of any use anymore.. (counters are fairly high on
that list..)..
