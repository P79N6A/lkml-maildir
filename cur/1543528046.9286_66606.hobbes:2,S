From the comp.lang.c FAQ:
Section 17. Miscellaneous
17.1:   What can I safely assume about the initial values of variables
        which are not explicitly initialized?  If global variables start
        out as "zero," is that good enough for null pointers and
        floating-point zeroes?
A:      Variables with "static" duration (that is, those declared
        outside of functions, and those declared with the storage class
        static), are guaranteed initialized to zero, as if the
        programmer had typed "= 0".  Therefore, such variables are
        initialized to the null pointer (of the correct type) if they
        are pointers, and to 0.0 if they are floating-point.
        Variables with "automatic" duration (i.e. local variables
        without the static storage class) start out containing garbage,
        unless they are explicitly initialized.  Nothing useful can be
        predicted about the garbage.
        Dynamically-allocated memory obtained with malloc and realloc is
        also likely to contain garbage, and must be initialized by the
        calling program, as appropriate.  Memory obtained with calloc
        contains all-bits-0, but this is not necessarily useful for
        pointer or floating-point values (see question 3.11, and section
        1). 
Sorry to quote you chapter and verse, but your dressing down required it,
me thinks.
