   Which other runtime checks are possible?
   Tests for correct _irq usage are not possible, several drivers use
   disable_irq().
Keep track of how many locks are being held at once, and check if it
is zero at switch_to() time.  You can also do this to measure things
like max number of locks held at once and other statistics.
I added the first bit to sparc64 while hunting down a bug.
