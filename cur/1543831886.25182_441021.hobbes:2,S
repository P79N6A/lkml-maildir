Oh.. this is a real Homer Simpson moment.... "D'Oh!" :)
The grub definition:
title 2.6.17-mm2 testing
        kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.17-mm2-test single console=tty0 vga=794
        initrd /initrd-selinux.img
Yes, this laptop has a real actual DB-9 serial port on the back, and I've had
it defined as a console for forever (since trying to debug a problem against
2.5.60 or so).  So maybe that's where it's coming from.  But a quick boot
test or 3 shows the console=tty0 isn't the problem.  It turns out to be
the 'vga=794', which selects this mode:
[   16.633604] Console: colour dummy device 80x25
[   17.685983] Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 160x64
And we promptly get a timing problem.  I tried booting with 'vga=ask' and
choosing mode 1, and got this mode instead:
[   31.003715] Console: colour VGA+ 80x50
And things came up fine at that point.  Apparently, trying to scroll a big
160x64 is sufficiently slower than scrolling an 80x50 to trigger the problem.
I'd look at John's patch in the morning:

Too many 2:30AM's in the past 2 weeks for a guy my age.. (Actually, the
2:30AM isn't the problem - it's the office hours 7 hours later. ;)
