The problem I see with this approach is that the time that passes between
two jiffies might be too long for 10G ethernet adapters. (I tried to implement
a timer based approach with usual timers and the result was a disaster).
HW interrupts / or HP timer avoid the jiffy problem as they activate softIRQs
as soon as you call netif_rx_schedule.
