Subject: [PATCH] Mark timer_stats as incompatible with multiple pid namespaces
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

/proc/timer_stats currently reports the user of a timer by pid,
which is a reasonable approach.  However if you are not in
the initial pid namespace the pid that is reported is nonsense.
Therefore until we can make timer_stats pid namespace safe just
disable it in the build if pid namespace support is selected
so we at least know we have a conflict.
