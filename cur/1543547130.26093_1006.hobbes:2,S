If you are going to store options the kernel was built with, you 
might as well get rid of all the cruft so you don't run into size
problems. For example:
sed '/=m/d;s/=y//;/^CONFIG_/s///p;d' .config |    \
	gzip -9 | scripts/bin2c kernel_config_data > $@
maintains all the useful information and will be less than 1/2kB.
(things marked as not set or modular aren't relevant to the zImage)
You can reconstruct it back with:
gzip -d < /proc/config.gz | sed '/=/\!s/$/=y/;s/^/CONFIG_/' > .config
Run 'make oldconfig' and hold down the Enter key for a few seconds.
Paul.
