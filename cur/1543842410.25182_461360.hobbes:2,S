I don't see disadvantages, probably the usefulness is in doubt.

Do you mean using [kj]probes?

Probes at the beginning of the routine instead of at some offset (the
way it is already done), should reduce the rework burdon.
The crashpoints are in core kernel internal routines but I donot see 
any "arch-specific" functions selected. I think the module can be used for 
any architecture with jprobe support.
