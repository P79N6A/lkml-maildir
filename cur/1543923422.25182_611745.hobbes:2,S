Subject: [RFC] Create instrumentation directory (git repository)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Since we already have the Instrumentation menu in
kernel/Kconfig.instrumentation and instrumentation code all over the
kernel tree:
arch/*/oprofile/*.c
kernel/kprobes.c
arch/*/kernel/kprobes.c
kernel/marker.c
kernel/profile.c
kernel/lockdep.c
vm/vmstat.c
block/blktrace.c
drivers/base/power/trace.c
We could move them to
instrumentation/
arch/*/instrumentation/
Therefore, we could also move the kprobes and marker samples under
instrumentation/samples/
Here is a link to a git repository containing the changes, based on
2.6.24-rc1:
git://ltt.polymtl.ca/linux-2.6-instrumentation.git instrumentation-for-linus
(the interesting range is : v2.6.24-rc1..instrumentation-for-linus)
Through the gitweb interface:
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=linux-2.6-instrumentation.git
Feedback is appreciated. Sorry for the huge CC list, but the change
involves many maintainers.
Mathieu
