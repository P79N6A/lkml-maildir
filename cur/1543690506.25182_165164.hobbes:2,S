Hi,
Since the change in kernel 2.4, read and writes go both through the page and
buffer cache. Is the cached data held twice (i.e. uses twice the memory)? I
noticed that the struct page holds a pointer to a buffer-head list; does
that list contain actual data, or just pointers into the cached page data?
Thanks,
Amir.
