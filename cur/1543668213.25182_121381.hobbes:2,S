Hi Alan,
First, the Makefile in your patch still says 2.5.65-ac4.
Second, I'm still trying to untangle the ppa driver problem, and the
'ac' patches may be a clue.  What I see is that there is a significant
difference between the 'ac' kernels and Linus's kernels:
With Linus's kernels the ppa driver actually does work, although I get
a kernel oops and modprobe segfaults after loading ppa.
However, the 'ac' kernels don't work with the ppa module because the
sda4 device never appears in /dev, so naturally the Zip drive won't
mount properly (although the ppa module does load with the same oops).
The /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target6/lun0 directory should contain entries
for 'disc' and 'part4' but with the 'ac' patches they don't appear.
Can you think of any reason that the 'ac' patches would have this
effect?
Thanks.
