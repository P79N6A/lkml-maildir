I'm happy the order is correct! But the warning 
probably will be back. I know lockdep is sometimes
too careful but nevertheless some change is needed
to fix a real bug or give additional information
to lockdep.

I admit I don't know this program and I hope I
didn't mislead anybody with my message. I only
tried to point at some doubts and maybe this
function could be better commented about when
the lock is needed.
Thanks for explanations & best regards,
