Are there any compatability problems with glibc2.1/egcs 1.1.2 (shipped with
RedHat Linux 6.0) and kernel 2.2.7? I can't seem to get any kernel above
2.2.5 to compile (2.2.6, 2.2.7, 2.2.7-ac3) on one of my boxes that has
RedHat Linux 6.0, but it compiles on my RedHat Linux 5.2 box without a
problem using the same hardware/same kernel config.
It always stops like so:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.2.7/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2
-malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=686   -c -o iovec.o iovec.c
iovec.c: In function `memcpy_toiovec':
iovec.c:92: `err' undeclared (first use in this function)
iovec.c:92: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
iovec.c:92: for each function it appears in.)
iovec.c:76: warning: unused variable `evr'
iovec.c:95: warning: control reaches end of non-void function
make[3]: *** [iovec.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.2.7/net/core'

I reported a similar problem earlier with RedHat Linux 5.9, but no one gave
me any useful information, just asked what RedHat Linux 5.9 was and whether
I had the symlink to linux from linux-2.2.7, which I did.
