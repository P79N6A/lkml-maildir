The authoritative reference is at:
http://www.radium.ncsc.mil/tpep/library/rainbow/5200.28-STD.html#HDR2.1.1
My reading is that:
For C1 we'd need only documentation and test program development; all
the basic mechanisms are in place. Most of the required documentation
exists too; it would just need to be pulled together in their format.
For C2 we'd need quite a lot of work. Extensive security auditing, dump
things that cannot pass, add some patches and perhaps some utilities,
and do a lot more documentation and testing.
Probably only a major distribution vendor could do this. You'd need to
control what goes into a distribution (no un-audited stuff) and you'd
need considerable resources.
For the B levels we'd need some basic re-design.
But the Rainbow Series of books are being superceded by the Common
Criteria:
