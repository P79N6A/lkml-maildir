 Yes. We have good experience with libblkid and libvolume_id. This
 concept is nothing new (see current RHEL, FC, Suse, ...). The change
 is that we've removed old, useless and unmaintained FS detection code
 from util-linux.
 I think move the library to util-linux is really bad idea. A better
 idea is detach libblkid or libvolume_id (or both) from e2fsprogs/udev
 and create an independent libfsprobe library and use everywhere
 (e2fsprogs, udev, util-linux) this library only.

 Well, Adrian Bunk added autotools stuff to util-linux during his work
 on v2.13. This stuff has been fixed and stabilized in util-linux-ng
 v2.13.
 I'm not fanatical autotools protagonist, but it seems useful in
 util-linux. We will see...
 I'm ready to change or fix arbitrary thing in util-linux-ng, but I
 always need a real reason -- bug report, new feature, or so. This
 discussion is about impressions and feelings only.

 Right. The autotools provides more features that portability only.
