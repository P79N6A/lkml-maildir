If you have the O/S playing around in the background on removable media,
then you have other problems.  I don't think that's a valid objection
--- quite the opposite, in a multiuser environment you _have_ to avoid
prompting the user to recover from a media-change event.

Exactly.  Nobody has given me a convincing reason why we need seamless
support for multiple concurrently-mounted floppies.

This is where you are being completely inconsistent.  mount/umount is
not bullet-proof for your first case (one removable media at a time)
either.  So far your argument seems to be that it's OK to lose data as
long as you only lose it on one disk at once.  mount/umount is _not_
good enough for single floppies.  We can make it good enough without the
overkill of something like Sun's vold.

Sheesh.  If the user wanted the data saved to the disk, then why did
they remove the disk while it was being written?
