Much simpler than that. Most distributions have a pam module already
which updates permissions on things that the "console" user may want to
access directly (eg /dev/audio* /dev/cdrom etc) but which should
otherwise be protected from misuse (eg people with cronjobs that run
eject - an old an very funny SunOS prank)
If your distribution is like most and uses pam_console then see man 5
console.perms and add a rule to the /etc/security/console.perms file for
your file. At that point it will happily change the rights back and
forth for you as required.
