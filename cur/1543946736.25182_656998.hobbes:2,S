 They shouldn't be enabled at once. I think a patch 
 for Kconfig has been recently submitted to give a warning
 in such a case.
 rtc-cmos should be able to handle the vast majority of x86

 The only real open issue is related to the ntp synchronization
 mode and will be solved only when we can get rid of it :)
