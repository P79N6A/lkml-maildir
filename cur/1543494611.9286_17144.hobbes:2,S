FWIW -- I've heard much the same thing from one of the developers of
FreeBSD.  Instead of killing the messenger, why don't we just accept the
criticism as valid (and true) and fix it?
This attitude of "he-doesn't-know-what-he's-talking-about" is appalling
and will never produce a quality Linux.  Especially considering its
proponents and the target of the criticism.
Let's get a clue, smell the coffee, and go to work!
