Al,
On the assumption that you have hardware that uses this
driver, did you notice any improvement with your patch
applied?
Several of us have reported a degenerate mode, that
I term as "tmf timeout", in which a aic94xx based card
becomes inoperable. Alas, the same hardware running another
OS does not exhibit that problem (or at least not as much).

BTW Luben was pointing out that the call you patched
and the following call can be combined into a less
trouble prone asd_write_reg_dword() call.
