zlib is in the kernel.  Isn't lzo also in the kernel?
The problem is still the same, but not as bad.
And it's completely irrelevant to the current cryptocompress.  Saying
that someone could create a malicious transparently-compressed file that
blows up when decompressed (inflated?) is like saying that my /dev/hda5
is no longer trusted.  Because that's the only layer at which a userland
program can see the compressed version of a transparently-compressed file.
Now, if you're talking about going the other way, I think the problems
were less about buffer overflows and more about bombs where 1k
compressed data = 1 gig uncompressed data.  Going the other way is kind
of pointless if you're an attacker.
Unless there are buffer overflows in the kernel's zlib.  I hope not!
After all, I don't necessarily trust all the CDs that I try to mount!

Back at ya.
Many of the people I can't abide here are people who don't seem to
actually understand anywhere near as much of Reiser4 as I do.  And I've
never read much of its source code.
It would be nice if this was approached more along the lines of helping
get good stuff into the kernel than keeping anything bad out.  But
that's too much to ask, no sarcasm intended.  Didn't Linus say that his
job is more to keep stuff out anyway?

Did I admit that compression has problems?  I admitted that zip has
problems, not the planned cryptocompress plugin.

Can't trust the kernel at all if root is malicious.  For that matter,
can't trust anything if root is malicious.
Or is there a system which blocks such things as keyloggers, kernel
modifications, eavesdropping on random ptys, or simply brute forcing
/dev/mem?  I don't see any existing solutions other than heavily patched
everything (text editors included) for even blocking simple temporary
file hijacking.
Now, if root is not malicious, we can just go back to UNIX permissions
to keep your files safe -- only now your stuff is safe if the FBI steals
your disk, and I assume your root can be trusted to power off the system
before they can touch it in that event?
