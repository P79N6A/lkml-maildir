Hello,
I'm a senior in high school with a fair bit of programming experience
looking to get involved with the linux kernel. I'm currently reading a book
on OS design and last summer I hacked the IP masquerading and port
forwarding code for an internal company project so I'm not completely
unknowledgable. What's a good project to start with? I've heard that device
drivers are a fairly easy starting point. Unfortunately, all of my hardware
already works with linux. Is there a list of hardware that does not work
with linux anywhere? Can someone suggest an elegant, fairly simply device
driver that I can take a look at?
I also know a little bit of TCP/IP networking. Are there any small features
currently missing from Linux's TCP/IP code?
No need to reply directly to me, I'm subscribed.
Thanks in advance,
Avery Fay
