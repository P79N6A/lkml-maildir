This could be done differently.  m41t00_set() is only called on that global
variable, so why pass its address in as an argument?
The old code is also wrong: m41t00_set() was being passed a pointer to an
unsigned long, but then was casting it to a pointer to an int before
dereferencing it.  This works on a 32-bit platform, but it's just asking for
trouble on a 64-bit big-endian platform.  However, the driver can only be
configured when CONFIG_PPC32=y, so it will have gone unnoticed.

Fix m41t00_set() and its usage with workqueues
From: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Fix m41t00_set() and its usage with workqueues.  It doesn't really need an
argument since it always affects the same global variable.
