Actually, not _much_ work has been done in this area. Alongwith a bunch
of other people, I have some ideas about what needs to be done. For 
example, for NUMA, we need to try hard to schedule a thread on the 
node that has most of its memory (for no reason other than to decrease
memory latency). Independently, some NUMA machines build in multilevel 
caches and local snoops that also means that specific processors on
the same node as the last_processor are also good candidates to run 
the process next.
To handle a single layer of shared caches, I have tried certain simple
things, mostly as hacks, but am not pleased with the results yet. More
testing needed.
