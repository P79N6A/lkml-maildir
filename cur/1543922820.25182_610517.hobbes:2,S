Not on a battery powered device with a graphical interface.

In which case you need to remember why it was powered down and act
accordingly.

When you bring the battery device out of resume, and you've inserted a
card, you want it to be detected.  Your change means you have to wait
until the system has finished resuming before you plug the card in,
which practically is a pain in the butt and actually leads to user
errors.  IOW:
"I plugged my wireless card in after I pressed the power button, why
wasn't it detected?"
