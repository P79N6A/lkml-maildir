In case anyone is still interested, I finally got around to trying a
kernel.org 2.4.20 version.  No problem.  So it's not in the kernel
tree.  I compiled it using the /boot/config-2.4.20(whatever) that
Redhat shipped, so it's not a module/option issue.  The kernel was
signifigantly smaller than the redhat one as well by several hundred
K.
The problem was this, under the redhat kernel shipped on CD for redhat
9 and updated for redhat 8 my SO's computer locks up when she moves
her mouse after booting.  It's a USB mouse.  The system just freezes.
I haven't seen an Ooops or anything like that.  The syslog is
forwarded over tcp to my system, so I may see it even with the lock
up.
I assume the problem is a lost interrupt or something along that line,
but this is just a gut feeling.
How should I contact redhat about this issue?  It's going to be a
problem upgrading her system if she can't run a stock kernel.  I tried
writing a friend of mine at Redhat Erik Troan, but his old redhat
address doesn't work any more.
