Am I midreading that code, or does it really assume that the boot cpu is 
always zero? Or just that zero will be able to do the power off?
In any case I have had an SMP machine which did not have a CPU zero, and 
it was discussed here, I believe. Wonder what happens if you set 
affinity to a CPU you don't have...
