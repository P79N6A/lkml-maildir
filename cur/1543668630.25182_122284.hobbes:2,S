It works if you boot Lunix straight from the BIOS. I habitually keep
at least smallish DOS partition for recovery operations and the like.
I boot Linux from DOS. It would be rather hard to boot DOS from this
"DOS-booted" Linux:
The missing part is: restoring interrupt table, BIOS data and interrupt
handlers to pre-Linux values. Pre-Linux DOS installed some handlers in low
640K of ram, now thrashed by Linux. BOOM. ;)

Compare pre-Linux and post-Linux machine state. You may start from comparing
low 640K of RAM....
