I don't have the ATAPI spec, but since there was no compatibility issue, 
I will not be surprised if ATAPI specs got rid of READ6/WRITE6 commands.

The group 1 READ10/WRITE10 commands were in the X3T9 draft (1985) for
direct access device. So, the removal of explicits READ6/WRITE6 from the
sr and sd drivers will be just fine surgery. 
Obviously, the st driver still has to use READ6/WRITE6 commands.
Linux may well be the only O/S that still uses explicitely READ6/WRITE6
commands for direct access devices, in my opinion.
