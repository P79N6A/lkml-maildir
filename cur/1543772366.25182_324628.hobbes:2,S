Subject: [PATCH] Fix PCI BAR size interpretation on 64-bit arches

Hi,
On 64-bit machines, PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_MASK and other mask constants
passed to pci_size() are 64-bit (for example ~0x0fUL). However, pci_size
does comparisons between the u32 arguments and the mask, which will fail
even though any result from pci_size is still just 32-bit.
Changing the mask argument to u32 seems the obvious thing to do, since
all arithmetic in the function is 32-bit and having a larger mask makes
no sense.
This triggered on a PPC64 system here where an adapter (VGA, as it
happened) had a memory region base of 0xfe000000 and a sz of the same,
matching the if (max == maxbase ...) test at the bottom of pci_size
but failing the mask comparison. Quite a corner case which I guess
explains why we haven't seen it until now.
