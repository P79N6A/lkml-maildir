The automatic reallocation of bad spots on a drive is safe unless paired
with the write cache enabled bit in the disk mode pages (configuration).
WCE, in some cases, can cause the write/read to both take place from cache
with good status, and if the bad spot is reallocated later, when the cache
is flushed, the reporting gets very confusing.
In general:
It is a common misconception that if a disk begins to show some bad spots,
that it should be replaced.  In fact, a disk can have a reliable, useful
life for years after bad spots begin to show up.  The number of bad spots in
the Grown Defect List over a specified time as a % of capacity can be an
predictor of impending failure, however.
