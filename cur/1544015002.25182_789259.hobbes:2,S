I think that calculation is correct only the comment needs to be changed like this:
-       /* how many digits are in arg_num? 3 is the length of a=\n */
+       /* how many digits are in arg_num? 3 is the length of " a=" */
the count is still 3 - with '\n' or with ' '.

Is this a problem? We can do some workaround but is it necessary?

This would do the same thing (leading space in record).

Yes that's right - the space might be good if userspace client just
concatenates two records, the space should be good to be there. But I'm
unable to judge this. What do others think?
