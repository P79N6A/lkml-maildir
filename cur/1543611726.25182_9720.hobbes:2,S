in other mail I asked Erik about the disk's mode: it is PIO,
so the pathetic speed and crippling VM/Ext2 performance is 
entirely expected.  I'm guessing he's missing CONFIGs of either
the chipset-specific driver or one of:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ADMA=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y
