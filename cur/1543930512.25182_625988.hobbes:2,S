Thanks for the suggestion, Jean. I flashed my bios to the latest
(F12) for my Gigabyte GA-965P-DS3 (rev. 3.3) motherboard

Unfortunately, there has been no change to the situation. The same
ioport ranges are being reserved when booting with 2.6.24-rc4 and
it87 does not work. No change to the situation in 2.6.23.9 either, the
io conflict is not occuring and it87 still works there.
