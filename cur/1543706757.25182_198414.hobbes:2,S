On my uniprocessor system, I have two LKM's
driver1 takes hold of the spinlock....but does not release it...
driver2 attempts to take hold, and is allowed!!!!
how come spin locks don't work?????
how can I restrict access (to hardware) to only one driver at a time???
should I use semaphores,  etc...
