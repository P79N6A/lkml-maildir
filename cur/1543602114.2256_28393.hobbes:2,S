Well, if I run XFree86 4.1.0 (SuSE Linux 7.0 here, Diamond Viper V550
(nVidia Riva TNT)) and switch to virtual text-mode tty (Ctrl Alt F1),
hell freezes over. Screen turns black (but monitor syncs), machine is
totally frozen. No Magic SysRq can help. Just Reset can. I use ext3fs on
several partitions. 2.4.9 is fine, 2.4.9-ac7, -ac10 and 2.4.10 are
broken.
Serial console on 2.4.9-ac10 didn't have output, didn't attach serial
console to 2.4.10 yet.
Since this is somewhat hopeless to debug, I'm trying to do a binary
search to figure which 2.4.10-pre broke things, but it'll take a while.
Don't expect results before Monday evening UT +0200.
Are there any particular suspect changes I should try to back out?
