*  The C++ keywords in C headers are the first warning that you
   should _not_ use them with C++.
*  This will _not_ be accepted into standard codebase.  Don't you
   understand?  Making headers C++ compatible is the first tiny
   step for doing modules in C++.  Yes, from driver/module
   programmers perspective "they almost look same, and I think
   C++ is cooler" they (C/C++) should be compatible, but from
   kernel core's perspective they are whole different languages.
   (_Please_ do not say at that point that "kernel core is not
   my problem...")
   IF you do not do a whole grue layer for C++ like you should
   for Pascal, ADA, perl, etc...  you are better off starting from
   scratch a new C++ kernel...
   Kernel is really tightly depends on C compiler.  Look how
   kernel always breaks when new gcc comes out.  Not because
   the kernel is buggy or gcc is buggy (both are but bugs get
   fixed) but gcc does new optimizations which are legal by
   C standard, and kernel excpects old optimizations "but it
   always used to do that way".  Now when you bring C++ into
   mix, when C++ compilers are much more floating than C compilers,
   then the result is _real mess_.
   So when kernel core developers even hint that "yes, C++ is
   allowed, so if you find bugs then come screaming to
   linux-kernel" then they go crazy.
*  Real suggestion (well, demand :)
	1. Create a mailinglist/webpage for this project.
	2. Stop posting C++ noise on linux-kernel.  This
	   is OT, and distracts people.
	3. Search l-k archives for people hypeing C++
	   and ask them if they care to join.  Btw in l-k
	   are some people who claim to have some code already.
	   Also I promise if someone in l-k asks for C++
	   I direct them to you. (Nicely. (Really!))
	4. Document your progress and the obstacles you
	   encounter and how you solve them.  (So when later
	   anyone has bright ideas about C++ he/she can read
	   it and forget about it :)
	(somehow I doubt you get further)
	5. when linux++ is cooler/faster/etc...  then ask for
	   inclusion to standard codebase, or even, replace it.  :)

Good luck to you.
