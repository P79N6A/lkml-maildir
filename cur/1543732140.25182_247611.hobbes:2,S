IIRC, the compiler was generating out-of-line versions of functions in
every compilation unit whcih included the header file.  When we the
developers just wanted `inline' to mean `inline, dammit'.
If that broke swsusp in some manner then the relevant swsusp functions
should be marked always_inline, because they have some special needs.

If the compiler supports attribute((always_inline)) then the kernel build
system will use that.  If the compiler doesn't support
attribute((always_inline)) then we just emit `inline' from cpp and hope
that it works out.
