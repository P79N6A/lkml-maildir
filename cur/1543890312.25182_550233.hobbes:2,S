So "(check deferred; on battery)" wasn't explicit enough?  I guess I
assumed that users would understand that the opposite of "on battery"
was "on AC power".  I guess I could say "(check defferred 'til on AC
power)" if people think it would be clearer.

We do that already.  It's just tough to make that all fit on an 80
status message.  :-)
