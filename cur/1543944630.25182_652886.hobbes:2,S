Subject: Linux Compatible USB Adapter Recommendations? [OT]

I'm looking to buy a wireless USB adapter that I can
plug into a Fedora 8 box. The main feature I want it
to be able to stick it in and have it just work. No
custom kernel compiles. If it had 802.11n that would
be a plus. 
So - what "just works" with Linux?
Thanks in advance.
