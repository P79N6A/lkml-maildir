Josh
That is the purpose of my orignal message. In fact I have implemented
somthing along the lines of what you suggest below and I just want to test
the waters on whether this will be accepted. My current implementation is a
little more specific as it only gets the interfaces with IPv4 enabled on
them and skip lo but the idea is to get a consensus on what would be
genrally useful and then introduce that.
Regards, Juan

In general, the only way a "get interface address" function would be
accepted into mainline is if it was Generally Useful.
In order for it to be Generally Useful, you'll want to make it able to
get any address of any interface. Otherwise it's useless cruft for one
specific purpose, which can't be used anywhere else.
I'd suggest a function to get a list of interfaces, and then a function to
get a list of addresses for a given interface. Then you could just grab
the first address of the first interface for your application. Don't
forget to take into account that interfaces can change address, go up and
down, disappear/reappear, and change actual hardware...
And even that isn't Generally Useful. In fact, what the hell it's good for
is left as an exercise for the reader (implementation, too).
Though if "any IPv4 on any interface" will do, just assume 127.0.0.1 on
lo. Anyone that changes that has sins to atone for, and finding kernel
quirks is appropriate penance.
Did we mention that you'd be best to get the address in userspace and pass
it into the module? That's really the best bet...
