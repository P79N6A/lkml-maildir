I cannnot speak against this, I completely agree.
If I personally would use these type of cards, I think I would have 
converted them already.
*sigh* I think I'll step forward and have the first drivers converted to 
in-kernel i2c as soon as possible, so I can coerce the other driver 
authors to use proper firmware loading.
