Right. I am not sure exactly how to handle that. There is also the issue 
of the writes being deferred. I thought maybe of using pdflush to writeout 
the pages? Maybe increase priority of the pdflush so that it runs 
immediately when notified. Shrink_page_list would gather the dirty pages 
in pvecs and then forward to a pdflush. That may make the whole thing much 
cleaner.
Opinions?
