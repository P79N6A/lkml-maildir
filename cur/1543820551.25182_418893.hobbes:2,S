Btw, I _really_ hate commit messages that just say "this reverts that".
Please please _please_ say why it gets reverted, even if it's just a short 
explanation of what was wrong, and what the right thing is.
And if you have an old version of git that doesn't even start up an editor 
to allow you to talk about why the revert happens (yeah, that was a 
mistake), please do upgrade.
Trust me, you'll find a lot of the other improvements to your liking too.
