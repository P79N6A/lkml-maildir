The problem is very nicely described here, last paragraph:
<
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2007-07/msg01816.html>
It's not a problem anymore in (very) recent GCC, although
that of course won't help you in the kernel (yet).

In recent GCC, it's actually documented:
	 The ordinary output operands must be write-only; GCC will assume that
	the values in these operands before the instruction are dead and need
	not be generated.  Extended asm supports input-output or read-write
	operands.  Use the constraint character `+' to indicate such an operand
	and list it with the output operands.  You should only use read-write
	operands when the constraints for the operand (or the operand in which
	only some of the bits are to be changed) allow a register.
Note that last line.
