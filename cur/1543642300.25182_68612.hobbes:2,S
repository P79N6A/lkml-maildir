the latter would take care of O_DIRECT too I think. Of course it's
mostly a theorical issue, I mentioned it just so you would check it,
keep it in mind and eventually fix it, we had this kind of races in the
32bit architectures in on all the fs for ages, infact you know 2.4-aa is
the only tree out there with these race fixed for most important fs, 2.4
and 2.5 mainline are still racy too (2.4 because it was a recent
discovery, 2.5 because it's my mistake that I didn't yet had time to
submit fixes, btw, if anybody is interested to port to 2.5 that's
welcome).  For the normal fs I didn't want to add locks around the read
and truncate paths, and that's why I implemented the lockless accessors,
also consiering the accessors are zerocost noops on all the 64bit archs
(long [or should now say "short" :) ] term thinking).
