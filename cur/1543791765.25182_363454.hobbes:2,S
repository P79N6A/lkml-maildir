That's just code that's been moved around. But I suppose a speling fix 
could be included in the same patch. :)

The problem is that this code is also visited from pnp_activate_dev() & 
co where this return value is needed. For pnp_stop_dev() the same check 
(pnp_can_disable()) is performed in the suspend routine to avoid that 
particular problem. For resume my assumption was that a device that 
doesn't support activation will not have a driver attached to it. 
Perhaps this is wrong?
