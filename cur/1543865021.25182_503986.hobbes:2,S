Ok, starting from these patches I'd like to add a "battery support" to
the kernel.
What I suppose to do is a new class with a proper methods useful to
collect several info on battery status, such as get_ac_line_status()
get_battery_status(), get_battery_flags(),
get_remaining_battery_life() and so on.
The output will be APM-like into file "/proc/apm" (one line per
battery, or just the "main"/first one?) so that existing applications
continue to work and under sysfs into "/sysfs/class/battery".
Is it sane? :)
Thanks in advance,
Rodolfo
