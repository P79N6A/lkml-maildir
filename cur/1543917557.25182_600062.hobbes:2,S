There were 386 PC clones for sure, and they almost certainly needed it 
and still do. IBM was doing the MCA thing at that time and it was a 
wonderful time for the clone makers.

AFAIK you are just right, I'm pretty sure there will be systems needing 
it for 386 and 486, and maybe the old Pentium systems as well. A lot of 
system vendors wanted it so software for the old systems would still work.
