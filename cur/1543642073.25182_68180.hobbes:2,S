Speaking of sddr09 devices (of which I possess one), what's the current
state of support for the sddr09?  Last I knew, at the time when I finally
got mine working, the sddr09 was only supported read-only, since there
were not-fully-understood issues that resulted in filesystem corruption 
if you tried to write to it.  Currently, the driver will still allow me
to mount it only as a read-only filesystem.  Can write support for the
sddr09 be expected any time soon?
