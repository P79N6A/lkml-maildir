I though that first thing that makes particular technology interesting 
or otherwise appealing to developers is the technology itself, i.e. is 
it interesting, appealing, innovative and superior, is it tomorrow today 
and so on. From that point, OpenVZ is pretty much interesting. From the 
point of openness -- well, you might be right, there's still something 
we could do.
I understand it should work both ways -- we should provide easier ways 
to access the code, to contribute etc. Still, I see little to no 
interest of contributing to OpenVZ kernel. Probably this is because of 
high entry level, probably it is because we are not yet open enough or so.
Any way, I would love to hear any comments/suggestions of how we can 
improve this situation from our side (and let me express hope you will 
improve it from yours:)).
Regards,
  Kir.
