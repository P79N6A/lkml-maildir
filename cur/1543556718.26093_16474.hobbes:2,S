Well, at least on current ix86 processors it can't. Attempting to
use a task gate appears to be a trick to cause the exception to
be handled on the current stack. The hardware protection hierarchy
won't let this happen. You need to have a stack that is not accessible
from the mode that will be trapped. Otherwise, a user could crash
the machine by setting ESP to 0 and waiting for the next context-
switch or timer-tick.
