Greg, can I ssh to your box to do
	git rm -rf drivers/staging/epl
	sed -i -e '/epl/d' drivers/staging/Kconfig
	sed -i -e '/CONFIG_EPL/d' drivers/staging/Makefile
	git commit -a -m 'staging: remove epl driver'
?
This driver doesn't meet even _the_ basic requirements.
It's _full_ of hungarian notation (iRet).
It's full of typedefs.
It's full of HAL (tEplApiInstance etc).
Filenames (!) are in CamelCase.
It creates sockets from kernel for something.
It tries to interact with devfs.
It may come as surprise but you also committed real Win32 code:
	drivers/staging/epl/EplTimeruWin32.c
	drivers/staging/epl/ShbIpc-Win32.c
Amazing, isn't it?
Do you accept _any_ code? Exactly zero entry barrier?
