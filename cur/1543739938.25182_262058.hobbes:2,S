As I understand it, JFS was originally written for AIX.  The OS/2 team
at IBM rewrote it from scratch for OS/2.  Their version was cleaner, so
*that* got ported to AIX. (Maybe 5L, not really sure on versions here.)
The JFS for OS/2 is the predecessor to the Linux version.
Where's the Unix IP infection come from?

RCU - originally a paper, implemented in Dynix and in other operating
systems from the paper (and patent), implemented in Linux as well.
Oh, and disclaimers:
IANAL, all knowledge gleaned from extensive reading, not personal
experience.  Feel free to flame me if I screwed something up.  (And I
apologize if I did so.)
