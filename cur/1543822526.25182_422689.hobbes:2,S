Yes.  At least if nsproxy doesn't show a performance degradation...

The latter, uts_ns normally points to nsproxy->uts_data.  But it still
remains possible to unshare just the mounts namespace by simply coping
the pointer when we clone nsproxy, and incrementing the previous
ns_proxies count.
Like I said I think it is a long shot but if the data for namespaces
really does remain small and they are usually all unshared in a group
it could be a win.
