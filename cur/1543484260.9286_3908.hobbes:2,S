It probably works most of the time, but there are two gotchas.
(1) The kernel/module interface varies with certain configuration
    variables such as CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_PROCFS.  As far as I know,
    no one has analyzed out the list of such variables.
(2) Some module options affect code generated in the resident kernel
    (yuck).  You can find those by grep 'CONFIG_.*_MODULE' over the
    kernel source.
Yet more swamps to drain.  I feel low just thinking about it.
