Yes. But as things stand, gdb 6.0 doesn't show stack traces correctly with esp 
and eip got from switch_to and gas 2.14 can't handle i386 dwarf2 CFI. Do we 
want to enforce getting a CVS version of gdb _and_ gas to build kgdb? 
Certainly not.
Current kgdb has a dependency on gdb 6.0. My RH9 gdb (5.3.x) can't talk with 
kgdb and complains about too long [sf]ThreadInfo packets. I don't like that 
either, but gdb 6.x should be standard on all distributions based on 2.6 
kernels, so that's acceptable.
