Subject: [PATCH] cleanup of ipc/msg.c

Hi,
Attached is a cleanup of the main loops in sys_msgrcv and sys_msgsnd, 
based on ipc_lock_by_ptr(). Most backward gotos are gone, instead normal 
"for(;;)" loops until a suitable message is found.
Additionally, the patch
- reintroduces lockless receive, same implementation as in ipc/mqueue.c.
- fixes a rare BUG(): if queue settings are changed with 
msgctl(,IPC_SET,) while a thread is sleeping in msgrcv() and the queue 
is then destroyed with msgctl(,IPC_RMID,) before the sleeping thread 
noticed the new configuration, then the BUG() is line 764 would trigger.
Andrew, could you add it to -mm? If it's too large then I'll split out 
the bugfix, it's a oneliner [remove the BUG()].
