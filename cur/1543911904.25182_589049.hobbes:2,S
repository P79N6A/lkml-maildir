Subject: [PATCH 00/23] drm: introduce drm_zalloc

Hello,
	As there are many places in drm code where drm_alloc + memset is used
this patch series introduces drm_zalloc and also makes use of drm_calloc where
needed. Most of these patches save some bytes so the benefit is a few kB saved
(gcc 4.1.2) with patch applied. Also some small (style, etc.) things are fixed.
This patch series does the conversion drm tree-wide. All patches were compile
tested.
Patches are against 2.6.23-rc3-mm1. Please review and apply.
Regards,
	Mariusz
