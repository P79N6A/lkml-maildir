I am sorry this reply so late, because of I had holiday for the National

Well, however, I don't think this is problem. ~_~
All troubles are come from between the generic driver and the specific
driver. Let me use
some words to explain both in my mind. First, the generic driver, for
instance, some
chipsets or some kinds of device driver, it let us use the common
feature of device. but may
be not complete, because of some devices may have some advanced
features, or more powerful
implementation. The other task of the generic driver is support API for
the specific
driver. Second, the specific driver, it base on the generic driver, use
the service that
is supplied by the generic driver, this let us some advanced feature
that the generic
driver can not support. Moreover, this architecture must not be two
layers: it can stack
into more layers. Use HID subsystem as one example, the hid-core can be
as the generic driver
for the hid-input, hid-input can be see as the specific driver that use
hid-core. The next layer,
The hid-input can be as the generic driver for usbnek4k.
And, I think the library module of design is not the best solution, The
library module, it can not
activate one kernel control path by itself, The most problem of this
design is it let some simple
device have rather complex driver. I think the generic driver frame of
design is good choice.
So, I think, the role of hid-input should support such interface for
other devices, not split out as one library module.
May be, I have some wrongs, please correct me, thanks.
PS:
    I apologized for wrote last email too hurry to lost some words for
Vincent Legoll in the announcement.
Goodluck.
