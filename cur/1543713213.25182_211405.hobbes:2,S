What exactly are you guys doing?
The API Anton introduced:  dma_mapping_error() takes only a virtual
address as the argument (no struct device or anyting), so the additional
API's pci_dma_mapping_error() and vio_dma_mapping_error have absolutely
no choice but to do the same thing as dma_mapping_error() (because the
error return cannot be bus or device specific).
So, why bother introducing all these superfluous APIs in the first
place?  Just stick to the single dma_mapping_error(); it will be much
easier.
