I think that should be UDMA 5 for 66? As far as I can remember UDMA4 is 33MHz with S.M.A.R.T. which
add some reporting functionality. But I might be wrong...

I got (kernel 2.2.18):
HPT370: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 98
HPT370: chipset revision 3
HPT370: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xe800-0xe807, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xe808-0xe80f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hda and hdc are my hd's. My mainboard is a Abit KT7-RAID.

I would set the UDMA5 for the HDs in the HPT bios.
good luck,
