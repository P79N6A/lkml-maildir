No, using it as a FILE pointer is fine.  Assuming *anything* about the
thing on the other side of the pointer is what got you into trouble.
Both then and now.

Whose documentation is that?  On my system, the man pages in
/usr/man/man3 are not written by the same people as my libc, and the
people who wrote libc don't claim to follow any behavior documented
there.
On the other hand, I *do* have a libc.info file that talks about
fclose(), and it says that it returns -1/EBADF *if* an error is
discovered.  It doesn't say what happens if it doesn't discover a
fatal error (it doesn't even says it always returns), and it doesn't
say what happens if I decide to fire a shotgun slug through my
computer while fclose() is running.

typedef and #define/#undef are very different.  As Khimenko Victor
already pointed out, you can't assume anything about what FILE
actually is.

On your system, yes.  On my system, I assume they're something quite
different.  On my system, don't care what they are, because they work
for me (doing things within the C standard specification).

If that's what stdin is on your system, then sure, it should work by
the same rules.  If you act on assumptions about what a FILE* points
to, you're trying to break those rules, at which point you deserve
whatever happens to your program.

Except that there's really no way to verify that a pointer is valid
from userspace that doesn't involve possibly triggering a SIGSEGV or
SIGBUS.  Even if they're mapped to valid memory, they might have been
free()'d and reallocated later.

The documentation for the Linux kernel doesn't mention fclose().  The
documentation in fclose.3 on my machine isn't canonical for my libc
(and I suspect you will find your fclose.3 isn't canonical for your
libc, either).  The documentation for fclose() in libc.info on my
machine doesn't say what happens if I force it to an undiscovered
fatal error.
I'm not sure what you find so confusing about the behavior you're
seeing, and I'm not sure why you're claiming that fclose() has been
``optimized'' in some harmful way.  As far as I can tell, the only
error it has made is the fatal error of trusting a foolish user to not
poke its innards and violate invariants on opaque pointers' data that
libc is probably very careful to preserve.
