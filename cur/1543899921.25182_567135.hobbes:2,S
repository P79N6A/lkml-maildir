Using 2.6.22-rc6-mm1 with a 64MB lguest and busybox, I'm seeing the
following as the best MemFree numbers after several boots each:
SLAB: 54796
SLOB: 55044
SLUB: 53944
SLUB: 54788 (debug turned off)
These numbers bounce around a lot more from boot to boot than I
remember, so take these numbers with a grain of salt.
Disabling the debug code in the build gives this, by the way:
mm/slub.c: In function ‘init_kmem_cache_node’:
mm/slub.c:1873: error: ‘struct kmem_cache_node’ has no member named
‘full’
