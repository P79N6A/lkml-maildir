I haven't seen this posted yet... .28, .29, and .31 all stop booting
during calibrating delay loop. .26 works fine. This is a Compaq 1670
with AMD K6-2 350MHz with stepping 12. CPU is specified as a Pentium.
Compiler is gcc 2.96 19991111... yes I know it's experimental but
unfortunately I don't have enough hard drive space to have 2 compilers
on the system and I have to have the latest gcc for some of the C++ work
I do.
