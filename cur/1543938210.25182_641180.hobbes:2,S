Subject: [PATCH 38/58] [GFS2] Run through full bitmaps quicker in gfs2_bitfit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Bob Peterson <rpeterso@redhat.com>
I eliminated the passing of an unused parameter into gfs2_bitfit called rgd.
This also changes the gfs2_bitfit code that searches for free (or used) blocks.
Before, the code was trying to check for bytes that indicated 4 blocks in
the undesired state.  The problem is, it was spending more time trying to
do this than it actually was saving.  This version only optimizes the case
where we're looking for free blocks, and it checks a machine word at a time.
So on 32-bit machines, it will check 32-bits (16 blocks) and on 64-bit
machines, it will check 64-bits (32 blocks) at a time.  The compiler
optimizes that quite well and we save some time, especially when running
through full bitmaps (like the bitmaps allocated for the journals).
There's probably a more elegant or optimized way to do this, but I haven't
thought of it yet.  I'm open to suggestions.
