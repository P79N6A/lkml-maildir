Yes.
Mostly general paranoia.  The problem is that the process could later
exec a suid root executable.  Potentially that suid root executable
could be fooled into a breach of security (such as not logging audit
records) because it is running in a network namespace.
The classic example of this class of exploits is using a mount
namespace to replace libc or /etc/passwd.  Both of which can lead
to privilege escalation.
I'm not creative enough at the moment to see how that class of exploits
would apply to a network namespace, but that is the reasoning for
requiring privilege.  
Let's see.  Having a network namespace namespace could allow you
to impersonate the local X server and steal a more privileged
users authentication tokens, provided by a suid binary.

All sockets are associated with a network namespace, and they don't change
when an unshare happens.  Accept still continues to work, and create
new sockets in the original network namespace.
However all calls to socket and to socketpair create new sockets that are
limited to living in the processes default network namespace.
