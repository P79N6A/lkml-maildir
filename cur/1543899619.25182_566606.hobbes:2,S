That's what I wish to do... I wish cleaning up as much possible my
pxa27x version af the driver so we can have something common where we
can work on.
Sorry for the delay but in these next days I'll read back all your
suggestions and I'll provide a new patch ASAP.
However I would like avoiding to remove what I did on
usb_ep_autoconfig() since I got functional g_ether device with RNDIS
support... there could be another way to resolve this problem?
Thanks a lot,
Rodolfo
