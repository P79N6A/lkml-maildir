I tried O11. Still chuggy in the AVIs and then locks out input into X. I 
switch to Alt-F1 console and hear the video advance, switch back, it 
pauses, switch to Alt-F1 etc. to get it through the video and then it's 
fine.
Incidentally, I moved my /home to another hard drive last night (same 
7200 rpms) to get more space. It makes no difference to performance. 
260-test2-vanilla was quite good and -mm1 and -O11 are chuggy and lock 
out input to X and require switching to virtual console to advance 
through the videos.
If there is some other data I can provide you, let me know.
