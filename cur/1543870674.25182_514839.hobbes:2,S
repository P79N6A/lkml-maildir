Well I would expect this to have marginal improvements and delay the 
inevitable for awhile until we have even bigger memory. If the app uses 
mmapped data areas then the problem is still there. And such tinkering 
does not solve the issue of large scale I/O requiring the handling of 
gazillions of page structs. I do not think that there is a way around 
somehow handling larger chunks of memory in an easier way. We already do 
handle larger page sizes for some limited purposes and with huge pages we 
already have a larger page size. Mel's defrag/anti-frag patches are 
necessary to allow us to deal with the resulting fragmentation problems.
