Where did you buy the HT8338/PCI from, and does it use DDMA?

So you've used the S/PDIF out? To what devices? Have you compared that it
was a bit-for-bit perfect copy? The 8330 had problems with S/PDIF clocking
and range truncation resulting in dropped MSB and doubled/missing
samples. This is what the 8338 was supposed to fix.
