I think Andi was suggesting using a indirection, with a table of pointers to 
PAGES, each PAGE containing PAGE_SIZE/sizeof(struct file *) pointers. Kind of 
what is doing vmalloc(), but without the need of contiguous virtual memory 
space.
You cannot just zap vmalloc() and use one kmalloc(), because some programs 
open one million files. That's 8 MByte of memory on x86_64. kmalloc() cannot 
cope with that. It cannot even cope with 32KB allocations but just after 
reboot...
