Digging through my glibc's source if found that if you memset arrays
<120000 bytes it will use good old mov instructions to do the job. In
case of arrays larger than 120000 bytes it will use movnti instructions
to do the job.
Thus I refined my test code to use mov for memset regardless of the size
(simply abused glibcs code a little bit)
-> No crash!
Then, changing the all the mov to movnti and my machine frags again :(
It seems that mov'ing does not kill my machine while simply using movnti
does.
kind regards Philip
