Ahh, sorry.  I thought that check was in open(), but I see now it's in
fchdir().  Next time please use '-p' option of diff, to avoid
confusing thoughtless readers like me :)
Though your patch does fix the bug, I still think it's wrong, since
mounting from a different namespace has legitimate uses, and is not a
security problem.
