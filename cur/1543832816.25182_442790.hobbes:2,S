D'oh. I knew that. Sigh. It's one of the things I like about having a
static ip on a bad connection. :)

Well not so much crashed but became unreachable due to the wsize thing.

It'll never terminate right now unless I hit ^c.

Not all DOS' are transfer based. Just anything that uses up resources to
the point where a service is no longer able to be performed.

After the fact really. In this case one can send mail to a box and make
it bounce to someplace behind a wsize broken network. Resources taken up
that wont return until someone spots what's wrong. You could make your
own wsize broken network, connect to someplace a few times and then move
on whilst their end hangs around, waiting for the connections to do
somthing.
In my test case I am wondering if there was/is a web process hanging
about doing nothing other then waiting for my end to do something.
