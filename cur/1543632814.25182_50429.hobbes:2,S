Even on an UP and no-MP-capable K6? IMHO this won't help (at least
myself).

I forgot to mention that there is only the 3c905 and a gfxcard (AGP) in
the box, no interrupts shared - I THOUGHT!
Then a quick lspci -v revealed both sharing IRQ 11. Will try to reassign
IRQs.
Thank you! :-)
Hope this is solved.
