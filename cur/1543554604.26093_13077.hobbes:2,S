Thanks for the prior help on getting the kernel to compile; real newbie
mistake of not finding the right options in the "make menuconfig" screens.
I can now compile 2.4.0-test, but it hangs on the first line of loading.
 -- I have tried 2.4.0-test10 and 2.4.0-test11-pre4
 -- If I only do my network adapter, it compiles and boots fine.  It is when
I add my desired settings (via "make menuconfig") for video support that the
compiled kernel hangs at system boot.
I have documented the exact procedure I use to compile the kernel at:

Help from other CUSL2 owners (or Intel 815E chipset) appreciated.    Feel
free to keep replies off the main list, as this may be a training issue more
than a kernel one :)
