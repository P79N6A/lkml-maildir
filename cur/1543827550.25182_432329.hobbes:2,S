task records a list of struct sem_undo each containing a semaphore id. When
we unshare ipc namespace, we break the 'reference' between the semaphore id
and the struct sem_array because the struct sem_array are cleared and freed
in the new namespace. When the task exit, that inconstency could lead to
unexpected results in exit_sem(), task locks, BUG_ON, etc. Nope ?

what is the proper way to handle that case ? the current patchset is not
protected : a process can be in one ipc namespace and use a shared segment
from a previous ipc namespace. This situation is not desirable in a
migration scenario. May be asking too much for the moment ... and I agree
this can be fixed by the way namespaces are created.

are you thinking about a command unshare()ing each namespace or some kind
of create_nsproxy ?

done.
