	Sure, as a user created solely for that purpose, it should be entirely
safe.

	Why? Is it because you don't trust your system security? Your operating
system shouldn't let the script do anything you don't want it to do.

	That should do no harm. What you mean to say is "if somebody is dumb enough
to execute any program recieved by email under a user account that has
permissions to modify files he cares about, consume too many process slots,
consume excessive vm, or has other special capabilities".

	If a user can run code that can harm the system, then nobody who isn't
trusted not to harm the system can be a user. That's not how we want Linux
to be, is it?
