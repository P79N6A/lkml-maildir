Timothy,
Perhaps check that your BIOS hasn't disabled it, or anything isn't disabling
it at boot time with 'setpci ... command=0'.

When I do 'lspci | grep -i audio', I get this:
0000:00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82801BA/BAM AC'97 
Audio (rev 04)
Unfortunately, every effort has failed to get the slightest peep out.  I 
have tried following the instructions on the Gentoo site (with my own 
guesses about what to do differently for 2.6 kernels), but I don't get 
any sound.  Also, the "alsaconf" utility says it doesn't find any audio 
devices.
Can anyone help me with this?
