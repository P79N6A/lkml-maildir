Subject: Tiny patch to fix TR with tcpdump

tr_add_rif_info turns of the source routing bit in the frame but
does not turn it back on for all exit paths of the routine.  For
programs such as tcpdump that need to inspect the whole packet
this plays havoc as the SR bit is off and it should be on.
The following patch is a quick fix.
