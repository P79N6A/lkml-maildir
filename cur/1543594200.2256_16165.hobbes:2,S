This isn't it.  What I'm trying to provoke thought on is
"is there a way to make mindless apps using these syscalls
work transparently"
I think the answer is no.  Apps should really fetch info out
of /proc/bus/pci and use the controller ioctl.
But someone could surprise me :-)

Correct, I agree.  But I don't even believe we should be sticking
the domain thing into struct pci_bus.
It's a platform thing.  Most platforms have a single domain, so why
clutter up struct pci_bus with this value?  By this reasoning we could
say that since it's arch-specific, this stuff belongs in sysdata or
wherever.
And this is what is happening right now.  So in essence, the work is
done :-)  The only "limiting factor" is that x86 doesn't support
multiple domains as some other platforms do.  So all these hot-plug
patches just need to use domains properly, and perhaps add domain
support to X86 when one of these hot-plug capable controllers are
being used.

Sure.  It's an address and the domain is part of the address.
