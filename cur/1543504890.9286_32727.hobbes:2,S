In my case, the exports are all with the same options:
	192.168.0.0/16(ro,all_squash)
In other words, they are exported to all local subnets as read-only
mounts, with all users getting the same permissions.

I haven't tried any of the -ac kernels, so can't comment on them.

True.

     (4) Advise your enemies that you don't want it done under
         any circumstances.
