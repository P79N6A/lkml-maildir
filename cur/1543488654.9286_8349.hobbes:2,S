Mar  5 10:15:45  xntpd[8829]: tick value of 4831837184 is unreasonably
large
When starting xntpd on alpha with 2.2.2ac7 I get the following error
reported.  This is a Redhat 5.2 system will all updates for 2.2.  Does
anyone know how to fix this one?  I ended having to use rdate every
minute because the clock gets so screwed up.
