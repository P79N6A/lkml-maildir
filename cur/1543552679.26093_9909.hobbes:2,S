Aha, I forgot to describe about making qlogic drivers as a module.
While I had been setting and testing SAN switch(Brocade, Gadzoox),
RAID with Qlogic 2100(or 2200A), I had the same experience that you 
described in the previous mail, and solved the problem by patching 
drivers/scsi/hosts.c as you did. It was a good solution.
But, I became aware of the convenience and flexibility of modular 
drivers(or initrd) in this case.
Because, I thought, whenever I do the same test or benchmarking, 
rebooting the system each is terrible. 
In that method, I experienced no problem such that you described 
in the previous E-mail.
