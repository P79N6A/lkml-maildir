There are a bunch of pending fixes at bk://linux-dj.bkbits.net/agpgart,
but nothing that should be relevant to this problem.
Are you using agpgart as modules? Which ones loaded ?
I've a feeling agpgart.ko loaded here, but not via-agp.ko
What needs to happen is when agpgart.ko is loaded, all the
chipset drivers also get pulled in as dependancies.
Since the new module stuff went in, I'm not sure how this
works, if it works at all.[1]

[1] I'm yet another developer who has had a rough time with the
    new modules stuff. I'll try it again soon.
