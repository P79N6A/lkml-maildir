Yes, it's quite handy, so just add that to your patch and we
automatically grab it.
I've added that info to the stable rules file in Documentation, should I
"announce" it anywhere else?

I normally just add the person who suggested the patch to be added to
the Cc: if they are not already on the signed-off-by: list.
Does it really matter who suggested that -stable pick it up?

We already add that info to the commit, but not necessarily in a
"standard" format.  If you want it in something like this, it's trivial
to provide it.
