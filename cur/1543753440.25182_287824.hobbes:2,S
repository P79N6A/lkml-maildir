Hrm... reading more of the patch & Martin's previous work, I'm not sure
I like the idea too much in the end... The main problem is that you are
just "replaying" the ticks afterward, which I see as a problem for
things like sched_clock() which returns the real current time, no ?
I'll toy a bit with my own implementation directly using Martin's work
and see what kind of improvement I really get on ppc laptops.
Ben.
