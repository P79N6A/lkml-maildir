I can do that, no problem. But isn't it better to recognize that this kind 
of data just can't be shipped through a non compat-able function?
Like, for example, the current trend to say "just use u64 for a pointer, 
it'll be fine". I remeber, a long time ago when the i386 architecture came 
out, to say "Wow! 4GB is gonna last *forever*!", let's use u32 for 
pointers. Well, forever is almost here in my watches. And all the 
userspace code using APIs assuming to cleanly store a pointer in a u32 
will have to be re-factored.
So, to cut it short, I can do the pseudo-siginfo read(2), but I don't 
like it too much (little, actually). The siginfo, as bad as it is, is a 
standard used in many POSIX APIs (hence even in kernel), and IMO if we 
want to send that back, a struct siginfo should be.
No?
