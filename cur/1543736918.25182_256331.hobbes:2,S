I have enclosed 5 patches that address each of the issues.
1 . Code is obtuse and hard to maintain
	The best I could do is update the comments to reflect the
	current code. Hopefully that should help. 
	attached patch 1_comment.patch takes care of that part to
	some extent.
2. page cache hits not handled properly.
	I fixed this by decrementing the size of the next readahead window
	by the number of pages hit in the page cache. Now it slowly
	accomodates the page cache hits. 
	attached patch 2_cachehits.patch takes care of this issue.
3. queue congestion not handled.
	The fix is: call force_page_cache_readahead() if we are 
	populating pages in the current window.
	And call do_page_cache_readahead() if we are populating
	pages in the ahead window. However if do_page_cache_readahead()
	return with congestion, the readahead window is collapsed back 
	to size zero. This will ensure that the next time ahead window
	is attempted to populate.
	attached patch 3_queuecongestion.patch handles this issue.
4. page thrash handled ineffectively.
	The fix is: on page thrash detection shutdown readahead.
	attached patch 4_pagethrash.patch handles this issue.
5. slow read path is too slow.
	I could not figure out a way to atleast-read-the-requested-
	number-of-pages if readahead is shutdown, without incorporating
	the readsize parameter to page_cache_readahead(). So had
	to pick some of your code in filemap.c to do that. Thanks!
	attached patch 5_fixedslowread.patch handles this issue.
Apart from this you have noticed other issues
6.  cache lookup done unneccessrily twice for pagecache_hits.
	I have not handled this issue currently. But should be doable
	if I introducing a flag, which notes when readahead is
	shutdown by pagecahche hits. And hence attempts to lookup
	the page only once.
And you have other features in your patch which will be the real
differentiating factors.
7.  exponential expand and shrink of window sizes.
8.  overlapped read of current window and ahead window. 
	( I think both are  desirable feature )
I did run some premilinary tests using your patch and the above patches
and found 
your patch was doing slightly better on iozone and sysbench.
however the above patch were doing slightly better with DSS workload.
But my setup is rather tiny compared to your setup, so my comparison
is rather incomplete.
