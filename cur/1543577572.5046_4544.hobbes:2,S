I've been using kernels with devfs right through the test
series and now with lk 2.4.0 . The only hiccup was
when I upgraded to glibc 2.2 [RH 7.0 upgrade]. devfsd
seg faulted during bootup and I got a similar message
(because the kernel couldn't find /dev/sda3).
Don't know why but this line in /etc/devfsd.conf caused
devfsd to barf:
LOOKUP      ^cdrom$      CFUNCTION      GLOBAL    
       symlink ${mntpnt}/cdroms/cdrom0 $devpath
This line is almost straight out of Richard's doco.
You could try and identify your disk to lilo explicitly.
For example if it is normally at /dev/hda3 then try
something like this at the lilo prompt:
  linux root=/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part3
If you can find the root partition that way, it will
probably fail later in the boot. To poke around with 
a statically linked shell trying adding to the above 
lilo prompt:
            init=/sbin/sash
Taking another tack, you could hope your root fs has a
normally populated /dev directory and try "devfs=nomount"
at the lilo prompt.
