That part looks OK.  The second loop was only there so we placed
common symbols first: now we don't do that, your cleanup is a good
idea.  I'll extract and test that part.

<sigh>. I don't think so.
PPC64 (not in tree yet):
+		/* REL24 references to (external) .function won't
+                   resolve; deal with that below */
+		if (!sym->st_value
+		    && ELF64_R_TYPE(rela[i].r_info) != R_PPC_REL24) {
+			printk("%s: Unknown symbol %s (index %u)\n",
+			       me->name, strtab + sym->st_name,
+			       sym->st_shndx);
+			return -ENOENT;
+		}
That's *why* find_symbol_internal() is not static, and why we don't
fail in simplify_symbol() 8(
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
