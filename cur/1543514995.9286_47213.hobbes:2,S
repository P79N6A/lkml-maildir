You seem to make a somewhat outdated optimisation here, offering
up I/O bandwidth (disk time) to save on CPU time. With the way
the processor/memory/disk speed 'balance' is going, I don't know
if that would be a tenable situation in the future.
The "I'm idle now, gimme work" idea is a very sane idea when
processors and memory are outrunning disk speed by many orders
of magnitude (and the gap is widening on a monthly basis).
Of course, it doesn't make much sense to give a disk it's block
when we've only got one page ready to write out, but once we
have 64 or 128 kB, it all starts to make sense.
