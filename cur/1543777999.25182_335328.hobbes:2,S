There was corruption on the cable between the controller and drive. That
usually indicates a cable or noise problem in the PC but could indicate
mistuning of the interface. Make sure the IDE cable is 
 [controller]<---- long section ----->[slave]--short section-->[master]
as one common cause is having the cable the other way around.
