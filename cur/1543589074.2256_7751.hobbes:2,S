Ouch.. yes you had to do stuff like that in the old days but it's very 
cumbersome and inefficient compared to ramfs for what you're trying to do.

You always need to "cache" pages read. Because a page is the smallest
possible granularity for the MMU, and a block-based filesystem does not
need to be page-aligned, so it's impossible to do it otherwise in a
general way.

I don't know what tmpfs does actually, but if it is like you suggest (a
ramfs that can be swapped out ?) then you don't need it obviously (since
you don't have any swap).
ramfs simply inserts any files written into the kernels cache and tells it
not to forget it. it can't get much more simple than that.

i don't think you can set a limit in the current ramfs implementation but
it would not be particularly difficult to make it work I think

ramfs does not need any "resizing" because there is no filesystem behind
it. there is only the actual file data and metadata in the cache itself.
if you delete a file, it disapperas, if you create a new one new pages are
brought in.

you could try using jffs2 on a RAM-simulated MTD partition. i think that
would work but i have not tried it..

ramfs has all the bells and whistles you need except size limiting. and
obviously its faster than simulating a harddisk in ram and using ext2 on
it..
