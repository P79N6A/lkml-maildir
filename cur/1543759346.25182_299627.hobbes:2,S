Just to test things out a bit...
Here's the list of things which we might choose to put into 2.6.11.2.  I was
planning on sending them in for 2.6.12 when that was going to be
errata-only.
From 2.6.11-mm1:
cramfs-small-stat2-fix.patch
setup_per_zone_lowmem_reserve-oops-fix.patch
dv1394-ioctl-retval-fix.patch
ppc32-compilation-fixes-for-ebony-luan-and-ocotea.patch
nfsd--sgi-921857-find-broken-with-nohide-on-nfsv3.patch
nfsd--exportfs-reduce-stack-usage.patch
nfsd--svcrpc-add-a-per-flavor-set_client-method.patch
nfsd--svcrpc-rename-pg_authenticate.patch
nfsd--svcrpc-move-export-table-checks-to-a-per-program-pg_add_client-method.patch
nfsd--nfs4-use-new-pg_set_client-method-to-simplify-nfs4-callback-authentication.patch
nfsd--lockd-dont-try-to-match-callback-requests-against-export-table.patch
audit-mips-fix.patch
make-st-seekable-again.patch
wrt the nfsd patches, Neil said:
The problem they fix is that currently:
    Client A holds a lock
    Client B tries to get the lock and blocks
    Client A drops the lock
  **Client B doesn't get the lock immediately, but has to wait for a
           timeout. (several seconds)
