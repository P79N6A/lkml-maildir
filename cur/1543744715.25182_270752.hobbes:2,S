Subject: Problem: 2.4.26/27 & 2.6.9 Audio CD Burning

I've reproduced this problem on my system with 2.4.26, 2.4.27, and 
2.6.9. When trying to burn an audio CD with cdrecord, the system load 
average will skyrocket (relitively speaking) up to 4 or 5 sometimes 
reaching 10 or higher. This does not happen with data CD's or at all 
with 2.6.7 kernel. I used scsi emulation (of course) on 2.4.26 and 
2.4.27--not 2.6.9.
Side Notes:
	DMA is enabled, I have tried downgrading cdrtools, and if I 			remember 
correctly it has the same problem in 2.6.8(.1).
Hardware:
	AMD Athlon XP 2400+
	1024MB RAM
	VIA VT82C686 Southbridge (IDE Controller)
	LITE-ON LTR48246S CDRW Drive
