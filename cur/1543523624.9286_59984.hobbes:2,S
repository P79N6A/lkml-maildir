Actually, when I squint at this bit of code, it look to me like the
problem isn't a potential hang.  Rather, it might be possible to exit that
loop too quickly.  ie. continue on the boot with A20 still disabled.
Here's the code
a20_wait:
	incw	%ax			# unused memory location <0xfff0
	movw	%ax, %fs:(0x200)	# we use the "int 0x80" vector
	cmpw	%gs:(0x210), %ax	# and its corresponding HMA addr
	je	a20_wait		# loop until no longer aliased
Imagine if %gs:(0x210) happened to be in the cache, and not equal to the
first value of %ax stored - We'd exit the loop immediately.  I dunno
whether all PC hardware handles these memory aliasing situations properly.
If not, then we'd exit the loop the second time around if we didn't the
first time.
