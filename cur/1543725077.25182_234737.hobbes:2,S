Hello, 
    In kernels 2.4.x and earlier the sym53c8xx driver had an
option 'synchronous transfers in frequence MHz".  It seems this
is gone in 2.6. 
     My CD burner for some reason needed this to be set at 5,
and without it it defaults to 10, and I cannot burn cdroms using
2.6 kernel, as it is.
     I've been told it may be termination related, but the cdrom
is supposed to be able to act as a terminator, and my SCSI
scanner has no problems.
    Below is the kernel messages, the cdrw is a HP9200.  This is
one of those 'it used to work things'.  I upgraded to fedora
core 2 and it uses 2.6 and does not play well with 2.4.
    Any way I can get that option back? Or an alternative that
will do the same thing?
    Either that or tell me where to get a cheap 50 pin
terminator for an ncr510a, and weather I need active or passive
or what?
Thanks, 
Joe
