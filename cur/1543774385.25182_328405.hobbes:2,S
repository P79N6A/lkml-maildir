Well, I don't. Main reason: It's simply a lot faster to create+switch to a
branch locally for doing independent work, than to hardlink the whole
Linux directory tree into a clone tree.
Having one tree also simpifies the "what do I have that's not merged yet"
question -- just call "gitk $(cat .git/refs/heads/*)". ;-)
The only problem I have with it is that "git-read-tree -m -u"
doesn't delete files yet. To repeat my question from last week:
>> Would it be safe to add all files for which
>> read_tree.c:merge_cache:fn() returns zero to a "delete me" list?
(files on which which then actually get deleted, of course, if g-r-t
doesn't find any problems.)
