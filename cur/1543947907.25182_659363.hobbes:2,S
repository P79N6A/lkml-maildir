25-rc2-mm1 is hanging early in boot on my HP ia64 numa platform.  I saw
the "Strange hang on ia64 with CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME=y" thread on lkml:  
	
http://marc.info/?t=120288396800001&r=1&w=4
However, my config does not include PRINTK_TIME=y.  In fact, hang occurs
with ia64 defconfig as well--right after the "Loading...initrd...done"
message.  2.6.25-rc2 boots OK.
Bisecting the broken-out series appears to indict 'git-sched.patch'.  I
went ahead and added Ingo's patch, discussed in the "strange hang"
thread, even tho' I hadn't enabled printk timestamps.  No effect.
Anyone else seeing this?
Regards,
Lee
