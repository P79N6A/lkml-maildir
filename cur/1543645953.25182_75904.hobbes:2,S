That _really_ depends on the nature of functions you want to call that
way.
I might agree with something along the lines of
	* when evms is initialized, it's notified of all existing gendisks
	* whenever disk is added after evms initialization, we notify evms
	* whenever disk is removed, we notify evms
However, I doubt that it's what you really want.  In particular, you
probably want to see partitioning changes as well as gendisk ones
(and no, "evms will handle all partitioning" is _not_ an acceptable
answer).  Moreover, "gendisk is here" != "something is in the drive".
IOW, the real question is what are you going to do with that list of
gendisks?
