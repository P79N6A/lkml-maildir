I read this thread some weeks ago.  I think there are reasons to have
both variants in the kernel. Since both versions are implemented in
different operatins systems and devices, having both will Linux make
interoperable with all of them.  In fact, the only implementers for
EtherIP I found were various BSD derivates. I actually implemented this
driver upon request of a BSD user who wanted interoperability of the
NetBSD EtherIP implementation with Linux.

I think this is not really a mistake in the OpenBSD implementation. In
my opinion, the RFC is unclear at this point. I focused on
interoperability in my implementation and did it the same way as OpenBSD
(as NetBSD does also, AFAIK FreeBSD has also an EtherIP implementation,
 but I don't tested it). This is the reason why my driver does not check
the value of the incoming EtherIP header too.
