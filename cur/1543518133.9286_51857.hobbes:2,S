Hi,
just wanted to ask if that's a bug or a "feature" or whatever.
If you do a llseek(fh, 0, SEEK_END) on normal file, you get the new position
(== end of file == size of file) as return value. So this is an easy method
for getting the size of a file.
If you try that with /dev/hda (e.g. 15GB), it doesn't behave like that, you
just get 0 as return value, because in
loff_t default_llseek(struct file *file, loff_t offset, int origin)
{
        long long retval;
 
        switch (origin) {
                case 2:
                        offset += file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_size;
                        break;
...
the value of file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_size is zero !?
Shouldn't that variable better hold the size of the block device ?
Thomas
