linux 2.4.19 - preempt - low latency O(1)
Yes, interrupts are disabled, and the code is sprinkled with loops and mdelay 
calls while interrupts are disabled. I'm roughly and probably inaccurately 
estimating that in the worst case the pc_keyb driver could call mdelay about 
25000 times before giving up with interrupts disabled. What's the best way to 
avoid the slow behaviour of the led lights if we don't care about numlock, 
capslock, or scroll lock?
