Ok, I assume the comment refers to the following:
    Attributes should be ASCII text files, preferably with only one value
    per file. It is noted that it may not be efficient to contain only
    value per file, so it is socially acceptable to express an array of
    values of the same type.
I was initially a bit confused because I thought the comment
specifically pertained to the piece of code shown above.  I need to
take a closer look at the EDAC sysfs code - I'm not as familiar with
some of its details as I should be.  Thanks for pointing out the
issue.
Dave
