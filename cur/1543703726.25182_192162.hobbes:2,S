Besides saving the CPU state, the code copies the original kernel back.
It sort of defeats the purpose to remove that code :>

Well, the whole things is pretty hairy :> But I don't think there's
anything wrong with assuming the boot and restored kernels are
identical. After all, we're calling it suspending and resuming, not
kexec. It does sound nice to do it all from the bootloader without
kernel help.

It is a well defined interface: a section of memory marked nosave, with
variables given the matching attribute. Not my idea, by the way. If you
have a problem, you should be taking it up with Pavel or Linus. We
should also note that the interface can't be too well defined - there
has to be room for development over time.

Yes. we device_suspend. Regarding the similarities with kexec, I fully
agree. In fact, there is also LKCD to think off. There should be a
synergy here.
