Apparently, initrd is just a name and a buffer.  Whatever it does with it is
a different story.  If the buffer looks like a cpio archive, it mounts tmpfs
as / and populates it from the archive.  No ramdisk driver, no filesystem
driver required.
Unfortunately for me, it doesn't work.  I'm still trying to figure out how
it works.
