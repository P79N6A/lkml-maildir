Or sparc64, or ppc, or ... any platform that adheres to the
rules specified in Documentation/atomic_ops.txt :-)
One really needs the barriers both before and after the atomic
operation when you return a value, because this is the only way to get
sane semantics for dropping the final reference to some object.  When
one does:
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&obj->count))
		__free_stuff(obj);
All other modifications to object state before the atomic
decrement must reach global visibility _first_, and then
the atomic decrement itself must be strongly ordered wrt.
future memory operations.
That's why it is documented that the memory barriers both before and
after the atomic operation are required when the operation returns a
result value of some kind.
There is a lot of code in the kernel that depends upon this.
