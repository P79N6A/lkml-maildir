Actually there was nothing plugged into the ethernet nor usb port. Could
it also be the airport failing ? I still use orinoco cvs, i.e. airport
0.15rc2HEAD, but that one also on 2.6.8.1. 
I now have a more or less reliable way of making this pbook crash: put
it to sleep and wake it up as soon it is sleeping.
