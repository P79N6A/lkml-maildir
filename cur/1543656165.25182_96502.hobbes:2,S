I have the exact same problem with sysklogd and I found 
that linux/module.h has a lot of new includes in 2.5 
that indirectly brings in a lot of .h files that 
shouldn't be included from userspace. 
Because of this you get both the compilers definition 
of FD_SET etc and the kernels version. I have not yet 
had the time to find out how to solve this but the 
solution is either to remove some includes or to add 
more #ifdef __KERNEL__. 
Question 1: Should it at all be possible to compile 
applications with 2.5.x headers? 
Question 2: Is there any chance that we can remove 
or #ifdef some includes in module.h (e.g. sched.h)?
