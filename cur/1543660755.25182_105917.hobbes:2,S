Sorry, didn't pay enough attention.
On second look: it's an u32.
But that brings the next question up: what about overflow? u32 means a max of 
4GB.
	u32 start = START_SECT(p)*sector_size;
	u32 size = NR_SECTS(p)*sector_size;
And this looks as if it was calculated in bytes - but I'm sure that 4GB is not 
the max size! Where am I wrong??
And btw, when can a partition that extends beyond the end be "allowed or even 
necessary"?
Thanks for your answer!
Regards,
Phil
