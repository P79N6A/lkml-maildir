Subject: [PATCH] ext3 "nobh" writeback support for filesystems blocksize < pagesize

Hi,
Reading through the code, I don't see a reason why we can't
support "nobh" option for filesystems with blocksize < pagesize.
Base infrastructure already handles it and kicks it back to
creating buffer_heads if it can't handle. 
Of course, there may be performance reasons why we don't want
to do this.
Anyway, following patch at least enables "nobh" option for 
blocksize < pagesize cases.
Thanks,
Badari
There is no valid reason why we can't support "nobh" option
for filesystems with blocksize != PAGESIZE. 
This patch lets them use "nobh" option for writeback mode
for blocksize < pagesize.
