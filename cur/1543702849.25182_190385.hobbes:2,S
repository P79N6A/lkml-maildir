Hello,
2.6.1 broke the ~/# key on my UK keyboard, when it used to work fine on
2.6.0. The key is now acting as Print Screen/SysRq. The keyboard is
connected as PS/2 (though it is also plugged as USB, it's a Logitech
wireless keyboard, with the receiver being the same for the mouse and
keyboard).
I didn't look at the changes made to the input layer in details. Could
anyone shed some light on this problem?
Cheers
