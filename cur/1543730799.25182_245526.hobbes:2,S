Hi Randy,
thanks for the help. I am very new to Linux
programming, and I do not understand what you mean
with  'syscalls are not called by name'. 
I did find the header file syscalls.h, recompiled my
code but it still says the following:
*** Warning: "sys_semop"
[/prj/builds/host/linux/prj.ko] undefined!
*** Warning: "sys_semctl"
[/prj/builds/host/linux/prj.ko] undefined!
*** Warning: "sys_semget"
[/prj/builds/host/linux/prj.ko] undefined!
And when I load the module, then it tells me:
insmod: error inserting './prj.ko': -1 Unknown symbol
in module
So, I call sys_sem* functions from my code. What else
must I do?
Thanks again.
Arne
