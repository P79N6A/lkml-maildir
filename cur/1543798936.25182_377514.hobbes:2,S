I think you're comparing applies with oranges here - you measured the
above function by executing it, and the reduced version by some other
method (you appear to be absolutely certain that it's 6 cycles, but
the previous was approximate).

That's over-simplified, and is the easy bit.  Now work out how you handle
the unlock operation.
You don't know whether the lock is contended or not in the unlock path,
so you always have to do the "wake up" thing.  (You can't rely on the
value of the lock since another thread may well be between this swp
instruction and entering the __contention function.  Hence you can't
use the value of the lock to determine whether there's anyone sleeping
on it.)
Therefore, I suspect that while the lock may be faster, the unlock
won't be.
