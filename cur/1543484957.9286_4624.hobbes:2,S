James Turinsky, the owner/administrator of LilithFair.Org, Linux user

One of these days I might actually learn C... which is why I support
this here.  KISS Principle: Keep It Simple Stupid.  That's why the
GNU/Linux systems get months of uptime (even with a somewhat cryptic CLI UI)
and Windows gets millions of users and only a few days of uptime (cryptic
code but a simple UI for most people)

Go Linus Go!
The groups and companies making their stuff binary-only ought to either
go true open source or keep their stuff up to date by compiling it for
newer kernel releases.  If they insist on stagnating after releasing
something for kernel 2.0.30 for example, screw 'em.

To which they should make it the people who insist on releasing only
binary modules.  Those folks should either release source or keep up
with the kernel releases!

I know if I got the amount of mail Linus does on this, I'd be in a room
with soft padded walls and in a jacket with arms that tie at the back.
Leave off the poor guy!

Hey you complaining folks, Linus didn't have to allow binary-only modules
in the first place.  Where would you be at now? (Redmond?)

It's the binary module's owner/maintainer that is responsible, folks.
Just like if XYZ Co. released only Windows 3.1 drivers for their card
back in 1994 and didn't support it under Windows.  You ought to be
yelling at XYZ and not Microsoft. Get the picture? Now go back off Linus
for a bit and let the man get some rest.

Thanks to those people who bleed, sweat, and cry to give us a free operating
system that I can use and sleep well at night knowing that it will be
running
in the morning, and not crashed by some weird TCP packets nor taken over
by a program that Microsoft markets as "Windows Remote Administration"
(Back Orifice).
Oh yeah, see the Linux song I came up with one long day!
