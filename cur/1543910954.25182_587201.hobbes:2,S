Subject: [patch 03/10] qdio: fix EQBS handling on CCQ96
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Klaus D. Wacker <kdwacker@de.ibm.com>
QDIO returned from EQBS instruction in any case after return code
CCQ=96 was issued regardless whether buffer states for at least one
buffer were extracted or not.
This caused FCP devices to hang when running under z/VM and having
QIOASSASIST=ON and having high I/O rates.
In order to fix this qdio return code processing of EQBS instruction
after CCQ=96 is changed that buffers are returned and if no buffers
where extracted the instruction is repeated at once.
