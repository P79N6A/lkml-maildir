Looking for work has keot me busy. I merged it. One change I did do was 
changed the CONFIG_FB_LOGO_* to CONFIG_LOGO_. In theory any one can use 
the logo (i.e newport console). It is a much welcomed improvement. I 
removed the hgafb logo code in the latest tree. It should use the standard 
logo code. Also how should we go about for personal logos. Companies might 
want to throw in there own thing which I have no issue with.
