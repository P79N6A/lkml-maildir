Can the original poster give an explanation ? I've enjoyed a rather 
well functioning 3c59x driver for the past ~6 years without such 
double reading. Plus:
- this operation is I/O expensive
- it is performed inside a region protected by a spinlock
- it is performed often, every 60 seconds
Is there some specific hardware that exhibits a problem that is solved 
by this double reading ?
