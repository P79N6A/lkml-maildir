Hello linux-experts,
  I am intercepting system calls in Linux kernel
2.4.28.
  Pseudo-code:
  ------------
    saved_old_syscall =
sys_call_table[sycallno(read)];
    sys_call_table[read] = my_sys_call;
    
  my_sys_call(file descriptor)
  -------------
     Call saved_old_syscall(file descriptor).
    
     Now at this point, I want to determine whether
the system call blocks waiting for the file descriptor
resource. How can I do that? Should I modify the
kernel code only for this?
   Can I check its state after the call as
     if (task_current_state == INTERRUPTIBLE
            || UNINTERRUPTIBLE) to do this?
             
Thanks,
selva
