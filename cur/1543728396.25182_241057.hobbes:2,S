I think that /sbin/overtemp is better, acpid may not know what do.
Suppose that the kernel delivers the event to acpid (or hotplug) but
they aren't configured to handle that, your CPU will melt...

It's more secure to call a program that can handle that for sure (ie.
/sbin/overtemp) and shutdown if it doesn't exist.
