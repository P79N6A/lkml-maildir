When I was in sudden need for NFS on a server with a nonstandard kernel 
installation and didn't have time to recompile, it worked just fine. 
This was with kernel 2.4.24 or 2.4.25, on Debian Sarge (package 
"nfs-user-server"). Upstream maintainers looks pretty dead, but Debian 
has a at least kept it in a working state in their archive.
