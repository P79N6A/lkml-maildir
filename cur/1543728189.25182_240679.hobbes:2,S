Thanks for answering Len. Due to the usual delay, I had the time to 
revert the paches myself before your answer and found that as expected 
the problem still persist (I browsed the patch quickly directly from 
bitkkeper acpi tree and found a priori nothing suspicious).
Curious that :
	- acpi=off boot option makes the problem vanish,
	- it looks like a deadlock due to an asynchronous event as it does not 
always occur at the same time after the boot finishes,
	- even without typing anything on the keyboard in single mode it deadlocks,
	- I never saw the fan suddenly wake-up (except of couse when 
temeratuire is too high) without a hard immediate reboot on this laptop. 
Here, during video (framebuffer) initialization, while the screen it 
still black they start spinning,
Will try andrew suggestion for the video-mode-handling-* patch
