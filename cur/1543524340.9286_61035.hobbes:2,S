Hi,
I had the same problems that ejecting a cardbus card locked up my notebook.
I traced it down to pci_remove_device(), which does 
	if (dev->driver->remove)
	{
		...
	}
The check itself causes the oops because for my cardbus device (3c575)
dev->driver is NULL. The only driver which works okay is the tulip_cb
which does a pci_register_device instead of register_device (all other
cardbus cards call this). 
The quick fix would be
	if (dev->driver && dev->driver->remove)
	{
	...
	}
which makes it more robust against misuse. But I guess the prefered way 
is to fix the cardbus drivers to register the devices as pci devices correctly.
