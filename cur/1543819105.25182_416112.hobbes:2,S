The only real problem is the page fault handler event.  All the other
calls to notify_die() are for rare events (MCA, INIT, restarts, halt,
oops) or for debugging events, none of which are performance critical.
DIE_PAGE_FAULT is only called because kprobes needs it, but that call
is on a performance critical path and it can significantly slow down
the rest of the system.
kprobes should be using its own notify chain to trap page faults, and
the handler for that chain should be optimized away when
CONFIG_KPROBES=n or there are no active probes.
