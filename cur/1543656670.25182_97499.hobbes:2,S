True, but there is always a point where you have to say, "This isn't
working, we need to re-write it".  Coding by cutting and pasting
existing code is not a great idea.

I am not prepared to start editing the existing Bugzilla code - there
is nothing about it that I think it right at the moment.  I could
write a better bug tracking database in a couple of weeks if I wanted
to.
