Ok. I guess I should have looked, but I thought the suspend
implementations were the only users of Nosave.

Yeah.

At the places where Reserved is currently set and cleared, I set and
clear Nosave as well. Then I only use Nosave. Swsusp still works fine
(although I have to comment out a bogus bug_on()) and suspend2 can clear
and set additional pages' Nosave flags while it runs (equivalents to
Pavel's nosave_free pages and also pages allocated for checksumming when
I get paranoid).
