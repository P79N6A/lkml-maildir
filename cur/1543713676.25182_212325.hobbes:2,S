Well, if you were a trophy hunter, I'd have to say "Skin that one, 
take it to the taxidermist and mount it on the wall, Dave" :-)
2.6.5-mm1 & xsane works again.  I'd assume that 2.6.5-rc3-mm4 would 
also respond correctly to this patch, but of course I haven't tried 
it.
Good catch & many thanks.

Disable a usbfs disconnect() synchronization hack, which recently
started deadlocking because this routine is now called in a different 
context.
It shouldn't be needed any longer now that usbcore shuts down endpoints
as part of driver unbinding.  (Except maybe on UHCI, which will have
canceled but not necessarily completed all requests.)
