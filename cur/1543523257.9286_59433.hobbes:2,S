All the private pages (data, bss, stack) from dead processes are good
candidates for zeroing, particularly since you need zeroed pages anyway for
zfod mappings.  The big problem with background zeroing is that it trashes
useful stuff in the cache, but some architectures (at least the PPC) let you
lock down the cache while you scribble.
