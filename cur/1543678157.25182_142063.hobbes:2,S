I think it's not debian glibc problem.  If you hit cmov problem, then
your application says "illegal instruction".  At least debian glibc
2.3.1-16 has trick not to load cmov-contained dynamic libraries.  All
libraries you pointed out are put under /.../lib/.../cmov/* in debian
sid.  I guess it's your CPU or thermal issue.
