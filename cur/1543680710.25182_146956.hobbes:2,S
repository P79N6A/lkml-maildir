I've been finally able to make my sound card to sing with 2.5 and I was
able to sh*t load my machine running RealPlay with the SOFTRR path :
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/softrr.html
I was not able to get a single skip. For many kind of applications it is
not strong real time that is needed. For example, in case on those
multimedia pps, I saw that they can live pretty happy with 10-20ms
latencies. The problem is that w/out living in the realtime priority even,
they can be sucked in by interactive tasks running they loong timeslice
multiple times. Plus-latencies of 100-150ms are very easy to get. Even if
the average latency, like graphs show, is very close to the expected one.
