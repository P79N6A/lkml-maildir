Folks,
	Who is tracking the 32bit dev_t effort for 2.5?  There are
already existing installations with 500 to 1000 disks attached to a
system, and I don't know that Linux really wants to wait four years to
get there!
	If someone could point me to a current patch or any current
information about the issues, I'd really appreciate it.
Joel
