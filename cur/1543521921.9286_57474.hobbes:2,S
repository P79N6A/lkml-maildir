Hi,
   I'm trying to upgrade my linux kernel to linux v2.2.14 using libc6 v2.0.7pre6
and either egcs v1.0.3 or gcc v2.95.2. The following build problems
are encountered regardless of which compiler is used and thus isn't compiler
dependent. See item (A-C) for a breakdown and item (D-E) for s/w pkgs and
kernel configuration. Yes, I know that these can be ignored but I think
they should be cleaned up before linux v2.4.x is started: especially the
"unsigned" conversion warning.
A).  PROBLEM:  during "make dep"
    NOTE: These are all in "asm-mips". Thus, "make dep" can't find them.
make[6]: Entering directory `/usr/src/lnux2.2.14/drivers/sgi/char'

D). My S/W pkg info.
