Hi,
I cannot get back to a console after logging out from a Gnome/X session.
I just got a blank screen which does not response to any key press.
I have to turn off the power. This happens on a IBM Thinkpad T43p with 
ATI RADEON X300 and
with the non-free ATI driver fglrx 8.28.8 and kernels 2.6.15 / 2.6.16
I have found this patch (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/11/26
) for ATI 
driver fglrx 8.20.8-1 that
works very well with fglrx 8.20.8-1 driver.
Could you help me to make a patch for ATI driver fglrx 8.28.8 and 
kernels 2.6.15 / 2.6.16?
Thanks
Bye
Marco
