I completely agree that 'throttle earlier' is important.  I just not
completely sure what should be throttled when.
I think I could argue that pages in 'Writeback' are really still
dirty.  The difference is really just an implementation issue.
So when the dirty_ratio is set to 40%, that should apply to all
'dirty' pages, which means both that flagged as 'Dirty' and those
flagged as 'Writeback'.
So I think you need to throttle when Dirty+Writeback hits dirty_ratio
(which we don't quite get right at the moment).  But the trick is to
throttle gently and fairly, rather than having a hard wall so that any
one who hits it just stops.
Thanks,
