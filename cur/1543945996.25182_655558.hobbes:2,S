Creating any uncacheable or write protected mappings in unsupportable? 
I suspect you would have a hard time actually justifying this. That's
a relatively common and useful operation in device drivers.
The only special case I would agree with you is doing write-combined
mappings using this which is indeed generally unsupported yet on x86
before the full PAT infrastructure goes in (but 
I cannot imagine VirtualBox would use WC for anything) 
Most likely if they just want to write protect something
they should either use the new interface or just open code
it using lookup_address() / change ptes / flush tlbs.
