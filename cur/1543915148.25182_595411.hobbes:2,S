It's weird,  because it seems that vsyscalls are only done by x86_64,
all others archs have only vdso... so they seem to forget about
statically linked apps...

Actually if we could easily retrieve the vdso in a process memory
mapping (through a new syscall or /proc/self/maps), it should be easy
for gcc/ld to statically links vdso functions into a statically linked
app, shouldn't it ?
