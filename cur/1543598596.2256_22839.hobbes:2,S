It's a highmem scanning problem, these were supposed to be fixed in a series 
of changes back in 2.4.8-pre, but they're not completely gone yet.  I've cc'd
a few people who've shown interest in this ugly^H^H^H^H particular corner of
the kernel, but now I'm shutting down for the night.  Guys, can you please
take a look at this one?  It's time to put the highmem allocation problem
definitively to rest.  Most likely, this problem occurs in -ac as well, just
with less frequency.
