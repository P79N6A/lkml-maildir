Or /proc/partitions, which - according to the mount(8) man page - has
been around since 2.1.116. So we're not exactly talking crazy upgrade
paths here.

Hmm, without PCI locations, you still need to know how the system
determines which interface becomes host0. Also, PCI locations
probably aren't the most user-friendly way for identifying things ;-)
But for the occasional problem case where label or uuid don't work,
any such information is, of course, valuable.
