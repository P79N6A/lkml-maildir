Eh?  Last I checked, there were other loadbalancing solutions out there.  Some
even use hardware (like ours).  IOW - LVS isn't the only use for the hidden flag.
This flag is useful for many folks, and is a generic (not LVS specific) kernel feature
which many of us would like to see added back to the kernel.
Granted, further discussion on the matter is an exercise in futility, as the current
net maintainer has already stated his disdain for it.  So...we'll go on patching
our kernels ad infinitum.
