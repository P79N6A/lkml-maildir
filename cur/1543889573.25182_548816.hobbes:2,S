I _still_ disagree.
There's a huge difference between "You killed my father, prepare to die", 
and "Btw, I didn't like that, but I'll just continue".
And that's the difference between BUG_ON() and WARN_ON().
And dammit, the kernel message should make that CLEAR. It's totally 
idiotic to call both "BUG". One is a clear BUG, the other is a "uhhuh, 
something unexpected happened, but I know how to continue".
So stop this idiotic "we should call them both the same". If they actually 
were the same, they'd both be called BUG_ON().
