Ok, so it's a design decision about configfs. I'll accept that. :)

Sorry, I wasn't clear. I meant that it's not possible to let the user 
create the parent directory via mkdir(2) within sysfs. I.e.
# mkdir object  <-- create object/, configfs only
# ls object
type
# echo b > object/type  <-- create b/, sysfs only
# ls object
type
b/
I cannot have both, sysfs and configfs functionality, within the same 
module configuration file system tree.

Because the layout in say a user tool configuration file will look 
pretty much the same as the configfs tree.
Anyway, for something different now:
1. Is there any guarantee that strings passed to struct 
configfs_item_operations->store_attribute are 0-terminated? If not, 
there's not only potential for buffer overflows, but there already is - 
in configfs_example.c, using simple_strtoul().
2. A minor one: I realize that the CONFIGFS_ITEM_NAME_LEN value of 20 is 
taken over from sysfs, but in configfs a config_group now has 68 bytes 
of size, and assuming that many times one would simply kmalloc a simple 
struct config_group (without extending it) this would result in a waste 
of 60 bytes per malloc. Do you want to keep that #define or reduce it to 
16? Just a thought...
