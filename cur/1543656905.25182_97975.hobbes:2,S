	"I'm working on this" messages (in my experience in lkml at
least) help people avoid duplication of effort, and perhaps sometimes
help multiple people who want to work on the same bug find each other.
	I think the "noise" would mostly be a user interface issue.
Imagine, for example, if the "I'm working on this" messages were
consolidated into a single link that said something like "4 people are
working on this bug", which you could click on for the details.
