Hi guys,
I made some minor cleanups to my BFS patch. Also, metadata write support 
is essentially there but for release I ifdefed it in read_super() like 
this:
+#if 1
+       s->s_flags |= MS_RDONLY;
+#endif
so, if one is brave enough one can replace 1 -> 0 above andl give 
-o  rw to mount(8) and see what happens (having backed up your data, of 
course).
Anyway, the readonly support seems stable and fast so I will concentrate 
on write support (but there are many filesystems in the official kernel 
readonly so I don't see why BFS can' be too).
Regards,
Tigran.
