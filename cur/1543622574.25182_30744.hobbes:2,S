When you remove a 3c59x-based cardbus, the fonction vortex_remove_one
is called and this function end with kfree(dev).
I was looking why enable_wol loose its value after a remove/insert cycle
but this value is store in the private part of dev so it's free with
dev.
The driver is not unloaded during the remove/insert cycle so it's a
kernel space problem.
Have I missed something here ?
