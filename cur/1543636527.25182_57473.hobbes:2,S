I've had similar problems with my Inspiron 4100.  If I leave it idle 
long enough (i think) and come back to it, it can work, but anything 
dealing with the disk just doesn't work.  Running any command results in
some sort of IO error.  I don't have it with me, so I don't have any of 
the details handy.  I was begining to suspect hardware failure on the 
part of the drive.  
However, suspending doesn't trigger the behavior.  I regularly suspend
it with no adverse effects.  
I believe I'm currently running one of the later 2.4.19-preX releases,
been meaning to upgrate it to a -rc kernel.
Hope someone can figure this out.
