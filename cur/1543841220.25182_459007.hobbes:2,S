The CKRM e-series is a PID based CPU Controller. It did a good job of
controlling and smoothing out the load (and variations) and even
worked with groups. But it achieved all this through some amount of
complexity. How do you plan to extend the idea to groups? Do you have
any code that we can look at?
I do not understand controlling the nice value? Most cpu control the
bandwidth/time - are there any advantages to controlling the nice
value? How does this interplay with dynamic priorities that the
scheduler currently maintains?
