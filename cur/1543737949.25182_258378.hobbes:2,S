The spec is usually pretty careful never to come straight out and
require that in all cases, even for true AIO.

It's not just the page allocation that can block, though.  Readahead
requires us to map the buffers being read before we submit the async
read, so we can still block reading indirect blocks.  If we want to
avoid submitting that extra synchronous IO, then either O_NONBLOCK needs
to avoid readahead entirely for non-present pages, or the readahead
itself needs to know that it's a O_NONBLOCK IO and fail cleanly if the
metadata is not in cache.
Cheers,
