I tried with 2.6.10-mm3 but couldn't find any instance of the problem:
BUT: I couldn't find it in the short time here now also with 2.6.11-mm4.
I skimmed over all my logrotated syslog files and found that in *most*
cases (but not all, at least I believe I saw another case, too) the
disconnect/reconnect cycles appeared when the laptop was running on
battery.
Does this ring any bell maybe?
I will try to give 2.6.10-mm3 and 2.6.12-rc1-mm1 a longer testing time
tomorrow, but now I have to go to bed.
Best wishes
Norbert
