Hi,
I have encountered problems with the following hardware
Via EPIA M-10000 mini itx
The machine is stable when using either the normal VGA text mode or the 
Frame buffer mode.
However, all hell breaks loose whenever X starts.
The following tests were done :
with agp enabled
run Xorg with the via driver -> X dies after a couple of seconds
run Xorg with frame buffer -> X dies after a minute or so
with agp disabled
run Xorg with the via driver -> X dies after a couple minutes
run Xorg with frame buffer -> machine is useable, but don't push it...
in all the above instances, either X dies without cleaning up after 
itself (and not logging anything useful), yet the machine is available 
through ssh, or, the machine is completely hanged, probability of each 
of those occuring seems related to the phases of the moon...
hope this helps
Raphael
