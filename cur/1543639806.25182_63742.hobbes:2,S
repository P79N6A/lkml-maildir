When you reverted the stringify changes I sent last time, you missed removing
a comment, which is now grossly wrong.  This patch finishes the job.

 /* Indirect stringification.  Doing two levels allows the parameter to be a
  * macro itself.  For example, compile with -DFOO=bar, __stringify(FOO)
  * converts to "bar".
- *
- * The "..." is gcc's cpp vararg macro syntax.  It is required because __ALIGN,
- * in linkage.h, contains a comma, which when expanded, causes it to look 
- * like two arguments, which breaks the standard non-vararg stringizer.
