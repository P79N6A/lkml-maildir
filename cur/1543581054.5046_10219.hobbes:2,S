Stop this idiocy, Stephen. You're _this_ close to be the first person I
ever blacklist from my mailbox. 
Network. Packets. Fragmentation. Or just non-page-sized MTU's. 
It is _not_ a "series of contiguous pages". Never has been. Never will be.
So stop making excuses.
Also, think of protocols that may want to gather stuff from multiple
places, where the boundaries have little to do with pages but are
specified some other way. Imagine doing "writev()" style operations to
disk, gathering stuff from multiple sources into one operation.
Think of GART remappings - you can have multiple pages that show up as one
"linear" chunk to the graphics device behind the AGP bridge, but that are
_not_ contiguous in real memory.
There just is NO excuse for the "linear series of pages" view. And if you
cannot realize that, then I don't know what's wrong with you. Your
arguments are obviously crap, and the stuff you seem unable to argue
against (like networking) you decide to just ignore. Get your act
together.
