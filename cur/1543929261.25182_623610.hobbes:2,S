You miss my point.
Stuff like sk_alloc was exported to modules before EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL 
existed (it was even exported to modules before EXPORT_SYMBOL existed).
We are talking about code and exports that are at about 12 years old, 
which is at about twice as old as EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.
So what should happen in your opinion if e.g. Alan checks which of the 
network code he had written when it was exported a dozen years ago, 
stating that he never wanted it to be available to non-GPL modules?
