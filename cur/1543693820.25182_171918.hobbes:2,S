0xcd594748 - 0xcd594718 = 0x30
gdb) p ((struct hpsb_packet *)0)->state_change
Cannot access memory at address 0x30
So someone is doing a down/up on the state_change semaphore after it's 
freed...

The state change synchronization is rather weird in that driver, then 
there is the whole double semaphore acquisition business which i'm not 
quite sure of. It looks better suited to a struct completion, but that is 
the source of your problem. This would be better handled by the 
maintainer.
