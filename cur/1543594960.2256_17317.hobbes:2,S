I try to be more clear:
Kernel space:
- irq 9 arrives from our device
- interrupts are disabled
- our kernel space micro handler is invoked
- interrupt source is checked
- if no notification is pending a signal is notificated for user space
(or a process is marked runnable)
- optionally our device interrupt generation is disabled
- handler returns
- interrupts are enabled
User space:
- signal arrive (or process is restarted)
- action is done
- notification is acknowledged (using an ioctl)
Kernel space:
- if we have other notifications to do, do one
- optionally our device interrupt generation is reenabled
