It certainly does for on ia64-compliant system.  Check section 9.3
"Multi-threaded Code" in the "Itanium Software Conventions and Runtime
Architecture manual".

I think this is a bit of a different problem.  On non-NUMA platforms,
the performance hit of enforcing order is not huge.  Basically, as
long as the CPU issues the accesses in order, you'll be fine.
Now, with NUMA platforms, where the chipsets/switch may re-order
accesses, the performance hit will be much bigger, so the old scheme
may not be sufficient.

I'm no NUMA expert, but my guess is that nobody will want to go
through all the existing drivers to change them to use mmiob().  For
new drivers, it might be OK.
