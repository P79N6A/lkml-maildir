It shouldn't, but it used to.  That's exactly what this patch changes (making 
tcp_moderate_rcvbuf *not* override the application's requested buffer size).  
Is it possible the application isn't asking for enough buffer space, and that 
the kernel was just automatically helping it before this patch went in?
