It'll be there if system will have memory. There are NO way to cook up
situation where system working Ok without overcommiting and not working Ok
with overcommiting so what the deal ? If you want to limit something you
need quotas not non-overcommiting.

This is not how malloc works. This is how calloc works :-)

Yes. Just 100% of existing applications doing it (ok, ok, ok may be just
99%). Why ? It's simple: there are 8MiB stack, you know. And only small
amount of that stack is used by typical application. And fork. And shared
memory segments (usually application will allocate big shared memory
segment "just in case"). And so on.

Go and fix [almost] ALL existing applications. Then come back.

See above. ALL applications (exceptions are few and rare) are allocating
8 MiB of memory (stack) and then not using it fully. Applications with fork
and shared memory are other examples.

Press tab twice and bash will happily show you few hundreds applications with
this behaviour.

Hmm. 8MiB does not look large at first but then EACH AND EVERY application
need it! And typically shared segment is created few MiBs in size "just in
case". Grand total for typical system is significant.

As far as almost all aplications out there are not using all requested memory
I see no reason to disable overcommit.

Too bad you just downloaded it and not read it :-/ All this about stack, shared
memory and so on was said already.
