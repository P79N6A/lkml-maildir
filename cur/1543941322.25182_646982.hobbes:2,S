why is this not static? I think the interrupt routine should be in the
file where you actually claim the interrupt.

I think a #define would be simpler in this case.

Why is allowing to change the major still needed. I think we passed the
bridge of the need for static numbers a long long long time ago.

This looks useless to. Do we need that?
