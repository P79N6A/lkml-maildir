Is that real SMP, or hyperthreading? If it's hyperthreading, then
it makes sense that the IRQs are not balanced.
In fact I have a server on which the IRQ balancing code does
balance over the 2 virtual CPUs by accident (still have to debug
what goes wrong and file a proper bug report) and as a result
performance sucked until I turned it off.
Mike.
