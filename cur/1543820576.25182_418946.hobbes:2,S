Hey Guys,
I'm looking to build a live linux distro using the live linux scripts..
I'm not sure if I want to use slax because I haven't used it enough..
I prefer Debian.. But I'm having trouble with the linux live scripts
because SquashFS and UnionFS isn't working correctly..
Anyone know of a new kernel for Debian Linux with Squash and UnionFS
built in?
