Ok.  That would make sense.

Unpatched 2.96 miscompiles some of the asm in the audio drivers for one.
2.96-69 as far as I can tell breaks just DAC960 and thats an apparently 
accidental ABI change in 2.96 and the CVS gcc about how packed enums are
handled.
2.95 and egcs 1.1.2 miscompile strstr() instead 8)
So yes.. nobody should be compiling kernels with 2.96 without the errata
rpm. With it nobody should see any problems and if they do find ones that
go away with kgcc I'd like to know about them (bug me Im sure Linus doesnt care
about them ;))
