Maybe is possible to create a generic device based on the gpio to provide
wakeup solutions on suspend-ram state to the peripherals
that registered to him
serial->register_gpio_wakeup             x_driver->register_gpio_wakeup 
serial->suspend                          x_driver
    |                                        |
    |                                        |
    \------> gpio_power->suspend <-----------/
serial->resume                           x_driver
    |                                        |
    |                                        |
    \------> gpio_power->resume <------------/
               |----request_irq n1
gpio_power-----|----request_irq n2
               |----request_irq n3
Create an attribute on the sysfs to add a wakeup reason to the user space.
