Sorry, but you're wrong.
">> 32" is underfined PERIOD! It has nothing to do with x86, it's a C
standards issue. It's undefined on any 32-bit architecture. (shifting by
the wordsize or bigger is simply not a defined C operation).
The above is not evil. The above is the standard way of doing this in C if 
you know the word-size is 32-bits or bigger.
