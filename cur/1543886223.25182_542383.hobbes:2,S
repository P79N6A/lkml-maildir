I honestly don't really know, but I've encountered that confusion a
few times. Both from friends who (for some reason) believed that and
from documents on the web that implied it, aparently it's a common
confusion - a few examples:
    
http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-perl/2004-June/000124.html
        "... volatile (atomic) fixes the problem. ..."
    
http://blogs.msdn.com/ricom/archive/2006/04/28/586406.aspx
        "That's the point of the volatile keyword. It makes sure that
the line "dict = d;" is atomic."
    
http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5126877&start=0
        "A volatile variable is also guaranteed to be read or written
as an atomic operation ..."  (yes, this link talks about Java, which I
don't know, but if java volatile means atomic, that might explain why
some people assume the same for C).
In any case, it's not an uncommon belief, so I just thought it made
sense to also make that little note.
