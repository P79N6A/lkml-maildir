Hmm.  Well, this i can understand.  I'm not using quotas, so I probably
wouldn't have ever introduced any bugs. I don't have a lot of time to
try to understand the quota system, so I was just looking for the quick fix.
I'll rebuild under 2.4.1-pre10 with the patch and see how things go from
there.
Thanks,
Leif
