It is.

You have it backward. The SVR4/i386 ELF ABI specification is requiring
userspace to be granted at least 3GB of address space.
This does not necessarily present a restriction for the kernel;
consider task gates (mingo did it by hand).

You should probably ignore this thread. It's probably not relevant to
you.

Highmem support gets you this on ia32. Other architectures can support it
with less overhead.

If you have such a cpu why are you bothering with highmem (or wondering
if > 2GB is supported)?
