"having been non-zero before that" makes a lot more sense indeed, the
wording in the specs wasn't the best IMHO.  Interestingly the
ptep_establish at the end of handle_pte_fault would have hidden any
double fault completely, nobody but a tracer would have noticed that,
but it made very little sense that non-present entries can be cached.
It's all clear now thanks.
