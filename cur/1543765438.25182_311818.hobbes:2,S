Well there is a cdwrite mailing list hosted on lists.debian.org which is
a great place to figure out what weird errors are and such, and the
authors of the programs used for writing discs are on thoses lists too,
so you may want to ask for advice there.
Did you try writing using ide-scsi mode with growisofs ?  Any
difference?  Does dvd+rw-media return anything with a disc in the drive?

It might require windows.  Certainly their firmware updates mostly seem
to cover 'improved media coverage'.
I have only been buying the plextor drives personally, since I have
never had a problem with a plextor drive yet, and I like not needing
windows to update the firmware and I find I save time by spending a bit
more on getting the best hardware I can reasonably afford.
