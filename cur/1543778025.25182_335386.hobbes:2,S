Guys, it is absolutely stupid to rely on a virtual filesystem for 
userspace/kernel communication for any events that might have to be 
transmitted inside the block IO path.  This includes, among other things, 
memberhips events.  Inserting a virtual filesystem into this path does 
nothing but add long call chains and new, hard-to-characterize memory 
usage.
There are already tried-and-true interfaces that are designed to do this 
kind of job efficiently and with quantifiable resource requirements: 
sockets (UNIX domain or netlink) and ioctls.  If you want to layer a 
virtual filesystem on top as a user friendly way to present current cluster 
configuration or as a way to provide some administrator knobs, then fine, 
virtual filesystems are good for this kind of thing.  But please do not try 
to insinuate that bloat into the block IO path.
Regards,
Daniel
