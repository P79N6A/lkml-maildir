In cases where the #if is several pages before, or there multiple nested
#if's, I agree. But when the #if is just a few lines up with no other #if's
around, it's ugly.
We have functions elsewhere in the kernel like this..
void foo (void)
{
#if MY_MEMORY_SUCKS_BUT_LIKE_SILLY_COMMENTS
    one_line_of_code();
#endif /* MY_MEMORY_SUCKS_BUT_I_LIKE_SILLY_COMMENTS */
}
What information is this comment adding ?
