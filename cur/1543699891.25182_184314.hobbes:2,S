I quit ... all of you win.
Just remember, had OSL been in place IBM would not need to exercise
patents against SCO.  Caldera and Canopy Group would be liable for their
own pollution of the code stream.
Next OSl provides a means to recover legal fees for the author, and GPL
does not.  So unless you have a FAT WALLET, you can not defend you works.
Oh yeah, just give all your copyright works to FSF and they will defend it
and get any of the finacial rewards and you get ZERO!
Later ...
