The DMA controller has some bits of state which are potentially in need
of restoration as well as a need to ensure you don't suspend while it is
running I would imagine. Even for bus masters I believe you would need
to restore the DMA enable bits.
See include/asm-i386/dma.h but note that some registers have side
effects and the dma_outb etc are used to get required delays on some PCs
