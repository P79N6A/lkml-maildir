hello,
please cc me since I'm not registered
I work on swapd and I found a way to "crash" a filesystem entry with 
operations on swaps :
kernel version 2.6.7
step to reproduce :
make a swap file into one directory
activate it
rm it
now all application trying to access the containing directory will 
hangs..... including the swapd I write.....
best regards
JLM
