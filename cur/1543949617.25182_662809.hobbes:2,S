Subject: [PATCH] cpuidle: avoid singing capacitors
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Many devices today are of a less than stellar quality, and singing
capacitors are a common problem. A high-pitch noise is created, caused
by power fluctuations as the processor enters and leaves deep sleep at
a high frequency.
Instead of just disabling the deep sleep (which wastes power). This
patch merely reduces the number of times it is entered so that the
frequency doesn't exceed 500 Hz. That should make sure the problem is
inaudible.

I've been playing around with this for a bit, and the jiffies approach
just had too many gotchas. So I tried using the information that was
already present in the menu governor. This is what I came up with.
It solves the primary problem of getting rid of the noise. I've also
tried some crude power measurements and I couldn't get any difference
with and without the patch. Powertop also nicely shows that the CPU is
still spending almost all of its time in C3. Therefore, I'm letting the
effects of it be enabled by default.
So I'm taking the [RFC] off it. Please still test and see that it
solves the issue on other machines, and the it does not cause any big
power surges.
