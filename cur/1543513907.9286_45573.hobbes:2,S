Hello,
I'm here again with a bugfix for my last kmsgdump release, thanks to two
testers who seem to love kernel recompilations ;-)
This time, the site contains a patch for kernels 2.2.13 and 2.3.23.

[ for the many ones who don't know, kmsgdump is used to dump kernel messages
  on a floppy upon kernel panics or by pressing SysRq+D. It helps debugging
  when thing go wrong. ]
Changes from KMSGDUMP 0.4.0
Henrique M. Holschuh <hmh@cps.matrix.com.br> helped me to understand why
kmsgdump couldn't compile on some gcc/gas combinations. He did a lot of
compilations for that. Thanks to him.
Neil <nascheme@enme.ucalgary.ca> reported me several conditions under which
kmsgdump crashed and/or reported empty messages because do_syslog caused the
crash which kmsgdump could catch and work around thanks to the checkpoints.
Now this is fixed and a new syslog function has been implemented.
Neil also sent me a patch for 2.3.22. Since I've changed several things in
the last release, it was simpler for me to upgrade from 2.2.13, but his
patch at least confirmed me that I was not wrong in my porting because it
semt like his. Thanks go to Neil too.
I modified a bit the checkpointing method. Now, there are retry points and
check points. Check points are more numerous than retry points. My goal is
to show, as soon as possible, a list of all check points where a crash has
been detected. This would have helped me even more with the bug related to
do_syslog.
Other plans are :
  - copy the code into low-space memory at boot time, when the kernel is
    still under good conditions.
  - don't copy the log messages anymore, but just a pointer to them. The
    real mode code will fetch them through a flat real mode switch.
  - truncate the file on the diskette to eliminate the trailing zeroes.
  - change the colors so that they won't remember you Windows anymore.
    I'd prefer to say they are Solaris colors, because Windows doesn't use
    cyan ;-)
                                        Willy
