   I'm glad that somebody fixed those pesky masks at last. :-)
   I've noticed that issue more than a year ago but lacking time, 
documentation and access to hardware, have never got to really fixing it... :-(

    This function never uses it as u32 entity, I wonder why read it? Just to 
hush a warning? :-)

    The same clocks for UDMA4/5... I wonder if PDC20265/7 indeed supported 
UDMA5 (as I'm not seeing any extra clock switching for this mode)?

    This seems even slower than SWDMA0!
    Let's assume that means 7 active cycles and 15 recovery cycles (MWDMA1/2 
settings seem to confirm this hypothesis) -- this would give us 720 ns vs the 
specified 480. Could you shed some light on what these fields mean? :-/
>  		case XFER_SW_DMA_2:	TB = 0x60; TC = 0x05; break;
    Well, this don't look right to me -- we need longer active time (given 
that my hypothesis is true)
>  		case XFER_SW_DMA_1:	TB = 0x80; TC = 0x06; break;
    This looks more fitting for SWDMA1 -- however, the recovery time seems to 
be overly long. It certainly doesn't look like SWDMA1 unless the 
active/recover times are not in clock cycles (should be 8 cycles, not 4 or 6).

    Same here -- should be 16 cycles both for active and recovery...
MBR, Sergei
