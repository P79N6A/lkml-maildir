This patchset contains a refactoring patch and integrity one. The first addresses Matt Helsley and Dave Hansen's comments on replacing the data[] vectors by packed structures making the code easier to read and debug and also consolidates most of the tpm_show_* functions. The second one provides an interface to read and extend PCR values, which is widely used by IMA.
