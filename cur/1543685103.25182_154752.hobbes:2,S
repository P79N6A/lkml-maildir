Hi,
From looking at net/ipv4/tcp_output.c, TcpOutSegs counts all
outgoing packets, including pure retransmits.  This seems
to contradict RFC 1213 (MIB-II):
          tcpOutSegs OBJECT-TYPE
              SYNTAX  Counter
              ACCESS  read-only
              STATUS  mandatory
              DESCRIPTION
                      "The total number of segments sent, including
                      those on current connections but excluding those
                      containing only retransmitted octets."
              ::= { tcp 11 }
Is that intentional or an oversight?
Lev
