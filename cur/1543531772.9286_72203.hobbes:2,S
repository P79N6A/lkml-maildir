DOH!  In any case, I can verify 1, 3, and 4, but not two.  I did actually have the
drive in another computer before running jumpon and with the cylinder limits on.  I
never tested Linux on it though so I have no idea what the physical geometry was
reported as (the BIOS translated the 66055248 sectors to 4111*255*63 though, same as
my BIOS).
I will try that hack you described and get back to you.  Right now I went ahead and
put the drive in and I am just real carefull not to span a partition accross that 32
GB mark. (my linux partition ends on cylinder 4111).
