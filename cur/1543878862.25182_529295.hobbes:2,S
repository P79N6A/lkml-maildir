I don't think it does.  It has always seemed an utterly cockamamy feature
to me, and I've never understood what actually motivated it.

That is the only way I can really see it being used.  The only actual
example of use I know is what Albert Cahalan reported.  To my mind, the
only semantics that matter for pdeath_signal are what previous uses
expected in the past and still need for compatibility.  If we started with
a fresh rationale from the ground up on what the feature is good for, I am
rather skeptical it would pass muster to be added today.
Thanks,
Roland
