Two things are wrong.
1. Linux has an OOM killer.
2. The OOM killer has a bad behaviour.
Presently, with the proper kind of load, one can see a process killed
by OOM almost daily. That is totally unacceptable.
People are working on refining the algorithm so that blatant idiocies
where processes are killed while there is plenty of resources
are avoided. Good. Suppose it done. Then one thing is wrong.
1. Linux has an OOM killer.
A system with an OOM killer is unreliable. Linux must have a reliable
mode of operation, and that must be the default mode.
Now you assume that adding SIGDANGER would make people happy.
But it would be a rather unimportant addition.
It might help in some cases, but it falls in the category
of improving the OOM killer a little.
People will be happy when Linux is reliable by default.
