I can't speak for Red Hat 4.4; but in general, you should be passing the
write flag to get_user_pages if you're going to modify the content of
those pages, which will then allocate the hierarchy needed and break
COW where necessary.  If that doesn't suit you (e.g. it's supposed to
be a readonly area in userspace), then you proably shouldn't be using
get_user_pages at all, but letting userspace mmap your driver pages
into its space instead.  Definitely don't play empty_zero_page games.
