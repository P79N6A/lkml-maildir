Ok, did new tests with 2.6.24-rc2:
- with plain kernel the usb-storage modules attaches and detaches
  permanently a virtual cd drive, I stopped after 30+ iterations.
- changing the penultimage argument in the usb_stor_huawei_e220_init
  function from 0x1 to 0 stopped this misbehaviour, but
- with the change from 0x1 to 0 the initialization works automatically.
Can we place change this 0x1 to 0?
Best wishes
Norbert
