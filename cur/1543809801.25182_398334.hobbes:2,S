Hm, OK, from reading this and the other threads on this
topic I get:
- there is a tradeoff between speed and robustness
- the focus for "robust futexes" is on speed
  (else they wouldn't deserve to be called futexes)
- thus it is acceptable if they are just 99% robust
That's OK, but IMHO it wouldn't hurt to clearly spell
it out in the documentation.
However, this leaves the question: Is there a slower, but 100% robust
alternative on Linux for applications which need it?
