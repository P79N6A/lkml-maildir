I thought I specified what was need to decode the issue, maybe since there
are two multiple threads now I have lost track of which one I am
responding.  Thus I will repeat in this thread.
True, however since I suspect the device was attempting to thwart and
crash the system, until a trace of the sense data returns from the device
and the re-action of the kernel to those target responses, not much can be
done to prevent such a crash.
