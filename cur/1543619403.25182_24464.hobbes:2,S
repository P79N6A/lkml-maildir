This _should_ be handled OK by the kernel simply by not mounting the
filesystem the second time.  If you try and mount it a second time it
_should_ just do a "bind" mount instead of a real mount, I think.
<stating the obvious>
Rather than mounting the device to try and see if it is already
mounted, use /proc/mounts or /etc/mtab or "df" or "mount" output
instead.  Doctor, it hurts when I do this... ;-).

Granted, this does appear to be a bug so the above will only work
around it and not fix it.  Al Viro is the one to pester about it.
Hopefully he will see this email and reply (== fix the problem).

The 2.4.10 kernel is a bad one to use for several reasons, don't use it.
Cheers, Andreas
PS - nice bug report, if only all of them were this useful.
