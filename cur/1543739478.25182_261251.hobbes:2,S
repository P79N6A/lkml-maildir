Yes, but worth it, I think.  Maybe some configure magic could
pick .asm as the suffix only when building on case-insensitive
filesystems, if that's the only way to make this palatable
to those devoted to the .s/.S idiom.

You are betting that you can force developers to switch away
from Windows and MacOSX workstations.  That's like
trying to get someone to stop smoking.  Yes, they should stop,
but nagging them will just annoy them.  In particular,
they'll simply apply the patch that makes the pain go away.
We may as well be nice and apply the patch in the mainline.
