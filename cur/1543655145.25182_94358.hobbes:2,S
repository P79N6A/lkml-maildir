   time ./configure might be a good test...
   
Agreed.

   Really? What workload besides configure does many small programs?
   
What do you do when you're developing code?  make, edit, ldd, ls,
grep, etc.
   Agreed for ls and cat, but I do not think it hurts for bash...
   
It does a lot of relocations in child processes, so I bet it will
matter.  'make' might be better off since it uses vfork but on the
other hand it does have quite sizable data structures.
