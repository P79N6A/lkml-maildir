Hi,
updating my laptop (Acer TM 512T) to 2.2.16 (-SuSE which is a 17pre1x with
some additional drivers and some of Andrea's VM fixes), I started to have a
lot of trouble with the builtin Synaptics Touchpad.
Using the touchpad, it suddenly started to stop working for a couple of
seconds and GPM logged Tossing PS/2 data messages.\ to the syslog.
It turned out to be a problem in the kernel's psaux driver.
Here's the patch that caused the problem.

Commenting out the check for AUX_RECONNECT does cure my problems.
Apparently, the synps2 does send the reconnect scancode for normal (or
special enhanced synps/2) mouse events.
The question is how this can be solved in a general way. I guess the code
was introduced to solve some problem. (Does the kernel get this scancode
when you plug a PS/2 mouse?)
How can we do it?
* Make the kernel recognize synps2 and ignore AUX_RECONNECT then.
* Make the gpm -tsynps2 do an ioctl on psaux which makes the kernel
  ignore ...
* Make the kernel aware of some state (mouse connected?) and only handle
  AUX_RECONNECT in case the mouse is not already connected.
I have not the slightest clue about PS/2 protocol, so I'd prefer somebody
with more knowledge to have a look into this.
Regards,
