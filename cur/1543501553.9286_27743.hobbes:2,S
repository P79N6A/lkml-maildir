This may be a nice hack for YOU, but in no way should this be in the
standard kernel.
This looks fine:
Clock interrupts            +        +        +        +        + 
App is waken up:                     *        *        *        *
app calls usleep (9000)      ^        ^        ^        ^
but... if the application uses 8ms of CPU time before calling
usleep again:
Clock interrupts            +        +        +        +        + 
App is waken up:                     *        *        *        *
app calls usleep (9000)             ^        ^        ^        ^
it will only sleep for 2ms before getting woken. And the manual states
that the sleep will be -=* at least *=- the number of microseconds
requested, and that you should always be prepared to be woken a little
later due to scheduling overhead or other tasks running.
