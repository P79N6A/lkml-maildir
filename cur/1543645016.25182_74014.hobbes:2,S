I see no real reason to call it 3.0.
The order-of-magnitude threading improvements might just come closest to
being a "new thing", but yeah, I still consider it 2.6.x. We don't have 
new architectures or other really fundamental stuff. In many ways the jump 
from 2.2 -> 2.4 was bigger than the 2.4 -> 2.6 thing will be, I suspect.
But hey, it's just a number.  I don't feel that strongly either way. I 
think version number inflation (can anybody say "distribution makers"?) is 
a bit silly, and the way the kernel numbering works there is no reason to 
bump the major number for regular releases.
