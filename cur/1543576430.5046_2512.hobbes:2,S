I get an endless stream of this:
kgcc:gcc272:cc:gcc: not found
kgcc:gcc272:cc:gcc: not found
/bin/sh: -D__KERNEL__: command not found
/bin/sh: -D__KERNEL__: command not found
/bin/sh: -D__KERNEL__: command not found
/bin/sh: -D__KERNEL__: command not found
I think the Makefile optimisation needs to be (cut-n-paste):

(what's the old saying - the first rule of optimization is don't or
something like that... ;)
