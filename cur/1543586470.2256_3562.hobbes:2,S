Subject: Oracle 8I & Kernel 2.4.3 : Sane ?

Hello. Some times ago, I tried Kernel 2.4.2 with oracle 8i 
(old version, 8.1.5)
Oracle was working fine at start, but after some hours we encountered
problems (I'm not database guru, I'm not able to say what was really not
working, it seems like a "rollback segment" was unable to be modified /
stuck)
I noticed that 2.4.3 contains some fixs for shared memory -
So the final question IS :
Is oracle 8.1.5 + Kernel 2.4.3 a sane combination ?
In general is oracle + Kernel 2.4 working ? 
(BTW, if that matter this is on a 4-xeon Proc + 3GB ram)
