Stephen, are we really sure we still need kpiod? Isn't GFP_IO meant to be
clear if anybody is helding any filesystem lock (like superblock lock)?
The fact is that we don't do any write-throttling in swap_out due kpiod
async nature. If we would do_write_page then we would do the write
throttling in the balance_dirty code while generating the dirty buffers in
write(2) and things would be probably go much better with respect of
memory allocations. While now swap_out returns succes in a hurry without
doing any progress. This is of course ok for the places that can't swapout
at all but when we have GFP_IO set we should be able to write to the fs
(otherwise what is GFP_IO meant for? if writing to the fs isn't safe when
we have GFP_IO set then swapfile (as opposed to swap device) wouldn't be
safe either). So it looks like to me I can drop kpiod but please tell me
if I'm missing something.
I see only one place that is using GFP_IO even while it grabs the
superblock lock and that looks a bug in 2.2.17pre9:
