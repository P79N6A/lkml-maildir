Of couse as an option. I don't say that it's a good idea for servers, but I 
heard several times that people are "confused" by Linux's boot messages, and 
people consider it as less "friendly" than other OSes because of the boot 
messages that they don't understand anyway. So it may be a good idea for 
desktop machines and inexperienced users.
Currently it needs a VESA-framebuffer, and if this is not available it could 
fall back to text mode. I'm not sure what the current patch does in this 
situation though.
