That's what I meant, sorry for not making it clear.

What's stopping the NFS server from ooming the machine then? Every time 
some bit of memory becomes free, the server will consume it instantly. 
Eventually ext3 will not be able to write anything out because it is out 
of memory.
An even more complex case is when ext3 depends on some other process, 
say it is mounted on a loopback nbd.
  dirty NFS data -> NFS server -> ext3 -> nbd -> nbd server on localhost 
-> ext3/raw device
You can't have both the NFS server and the nbd server PF_MEMALLOC, since 
the NFS server may consume all memory, then wait for the nbd server to 
reclaim.
The solution I have in mind is to replace the sync allocation logic from
    if (free_mem() < some_global_limit && !current->PF_MEMALLOC)
        wait_for_kswapd()
to
    if (free_mem() < current->limit)
        wait_for_kswapd()
kswapd would have the lowest ->limit, other processes as their place in 
the food chain dictates.
