... actually, the problems also occurred when running on machines
with Pentium II/Pentium Pro CPUs - even on these machines, I only
could use kernels compiled with "CONFIG_MPENTIUM4".
Adrian's patch does fix these problems. What is amazing, is that
in kernel version 2.4.20, the same values were used for
"CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT". The problems that I described,
however, occur only with 2.4.22 - the same machines with the same
configuration work just fine with 2.4.20. Maybe, there's
something else involved, too?
Regards,
                Peter
