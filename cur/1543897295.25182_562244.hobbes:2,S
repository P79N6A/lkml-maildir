Subject: [PATCH 1/3] Make struct jprobe.entry a void *
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/25/379

Currently jprobe.entry is a kprobe_opcode_t *, but that's a lie. On some
platforms it doesn't point to an opcode at all, it points to a function
descriptor.
It's really a pointer to something that the arch code can turn into a
function entry point. And that's what actually happens, none of the
generic code ever looks at jprobe.entry, it's only ever dereferenced
by arch code.
So just make it a void *.

It isn't obvious where kprobes patches should go, is anyone "the" maintainer?
Instead I've just sent this to everyone who'd touched the code lately, or
might be otherwise interested.
