usb_physical_reset_device() does not call usb_set_configuration()
except in the known-broken (for other reasons too!) "firmware changed"
path.  Known-broken, but not yet removed since nobody has reported
running into that or the other deadlock; the real fix is force
re-enumeration of the device.
The main path uses usb_control_msg(), because usb_reset_device()
currently guarantees it preserves (restore) altsettings as well
as driver bindings.  It couldn't even use usb_reset_configuration(),
since that gives altsettings their initial values (zero).
