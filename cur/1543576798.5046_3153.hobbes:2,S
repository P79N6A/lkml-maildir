Subject: Why was this APM patch not fully applied?

On Tue Apr 04 2000 - 23:19:12 EDT, Stephen Rothwell posted a patch to linux-kernel.
See 
http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/2000week15/0481.html
To quote:
This patch (against 2.3.99pre4-4) does the following: 
        Allow user mode programs to reject standby and suspend operations. 
        [...]
This first item is important to me. Unfortunately, the patch no longer
applies to current kernels (test13-pre4). Was there any reason for it
not to be included, or was it just ignored accidently?
(The patch is still available at 
http://linuxcare.com.au/apm/
 if anyone cares.)
