PowerPC with U3 or U4 northbridge, i.e. Maple or PowerMac G5 systems.
If the IOMMU (DART) is disabled, we have a 32-bit only DMA mask.  The
DART will be disabled by default if there is 2GB or less of memory (as
it isn't needed then).

That's only because I never used those cards on systems with fewer
than 4GB of memory :-)
