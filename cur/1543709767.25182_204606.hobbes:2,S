This is broken on x86 as well.  I guess I still have to question the logic of
logging bad data, even if you think the data is infrequent at best.  Keep in
mind that in my environment I'm not using high UIDs because I actually have
that many accounts, I'm using them because each employee uses their employee
ID as their UID, which simplifies management for me.  Again, this most likely
isn't typical, but it's not irrational, either.

I can understand this argument, and I would certainly agree for things that
are commonly used.  But given the state of the BSD accounting tools (a package
that hasn't had a public update since 1998, and which has non-high uid broken
bits in it as well) I would hazard a guess that the impacted users is going to
be minimal, at best.

I like it, and the addition of ac_version is a great idea.  I might alter the
comment about 64-bit machines in acct.c, though.  32-bit UIDs affects 32-bit
machines as well.

:-P I don't look at this any different than the byte-clipping we're doing with
UIDs.  If we're logging data that's wrong, then you can't do accurate
accounting, period.
