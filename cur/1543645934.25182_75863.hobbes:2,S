I was rediffing the task_cpu patch, when reached a new hunk in -aa:
kernel/sched.c::sched_init(void):
+   current->cpu = smp_processor_id();
As include/asm-i386/smp.h says, 
#define smp_processor_id() (current->cpu)
So you have a harmless and useless assignment...
unless you really wanted to do any other thing, or
smp_processor_id() != current->cpu in some arch.
???
TIA
