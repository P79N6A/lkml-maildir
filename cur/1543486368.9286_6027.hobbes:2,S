No. The fact you can lose data after a crash is. The long fsck times is
a secondary concern. Data integrity is the *primary* concern.
Manual intervention to repair broken directories and mucking around in
lost+found just sucks. Or in worst case, restoring from DAT backup :-(
A jfs would eliminate this entirely, plus fix the long fsck times.
Actually, a generic jfs layer (as Stephen mentioned?) would be nicer, then
it could be applied to any filesystem -- even sucky ones like fat32 I
suppose.
