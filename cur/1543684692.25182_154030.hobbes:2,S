Subject: [PATCH] IDE: Small fix for "hold" flag

Hi Marcelo !
The "hold" flag we added a few weeks ago to IDE to deal with
some laptop hotswap bays isn't properly kept around in ide_unregister(),
this fixes it. This fix is necessary for PowerMac media bay to work
properly (and this is also the only driver using this flag so far)
Please apply,
Ben.
