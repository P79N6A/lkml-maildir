nooooooo.  What you're saying there amounts to text replication.  There is
no proposal here to create duplicated copies of pagecache pages: the VM
just doesn't support that (Nick has soe protopatches which do this as a
possible NUMA optimisation).
So these mmapped pages will contiue to be shared across all guests.  The
problem boils down to "which guest(s) get charged for each shared page".
A simple and obvious and easy-to-implement answer is "the guest which paged
it in".  I think we should firstly explain why that is insufficient.
