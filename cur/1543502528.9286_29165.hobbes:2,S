i386 math-emu is broken with a buch of errors due to the tss changes.
nfs module fails to load with the following unresolved symbols:
	add_to_page_cache_unique
	__find_get_page
	__find_lock_page
Progress:
	tulip now loads as a module ... and seems to work.
	dpkg does not die anymore with fsync problems.
This is an i386 system (i686 compile) SMP with two processors compiled
with gcc-2.7.2.3 and a few more things that I need enabled just for
testing.
