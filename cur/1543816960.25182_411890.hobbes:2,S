Subject: [PATCH 01/03] Cpuset: task_lock comment fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/29/44

From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
Fix cpuset comment involving case of a tasks cpuset
pointer being NULL.  Thanks to "the_top_cpuset_hack",
this code no longer sees NULL task->cpuset pointers.
