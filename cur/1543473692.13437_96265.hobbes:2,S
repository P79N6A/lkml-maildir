2.2.0pre2 does almost exactly that - 386, 486, pentiumish, pentium(real or
as good as) and ppro+. If you build pentiumish you get what was basically
'pentium' in the old 2.1.13x kernels and everything is happy, you also get
the old style tsc if we can use it behaviour.
I was completely wrong about the scale of the problem, I've just flushed
most of the time changes from my 2.2.0-ac1 in progress tree and sent Linus
the small fixes for 'funny' chips. (That is the 'I've got a tsc honest
oops sort of well erm.. division by zero' variants of 'compatible'). 
End of problem.
