Technically, yes it is opensourced.  But one of the things that does kinda
distinguish one distro from another is the installer[1].

So yes, it is opensource.  So, counter-question.  Why should this non
distro owned program require a specific distro's program? :)   But this all
of course a moot point.
[1] The sum difference between YellowDogLinux 1.0, LinuxPPC, Inc 1999 and
LinuxPPC Reference Release was that two changed/help port the installer the
3rd did, which was RedHat's newt-based installer.  Some confusion ensused.
