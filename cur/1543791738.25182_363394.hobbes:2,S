Looking at the datasheet for this system,
gives the watchdog characteristics of
15sec - 127min timeout in steps of 30sec.
This is quite sophisticated and doesn't
match the original advantechwdt.c, w83627hf.c
or i810-tco.c. So you need to ask advantech
exactly what watchdog they're using on that system.
