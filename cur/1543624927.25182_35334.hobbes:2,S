Please for the Linux booting Linux scenario it is mandatory we get this right
for reboot.  I know for a fact that currently we leave active receive buffers on
network cards when we reboot. (If you haven't downed the interface).  So it
is possible for a network packet to come in and hose a machine that is rebooting.
Occasionally I test my linux booting linux code by loading memtest86 to make certain
I don't have something like that going on.  And the first time I tried it I hadn't
downed the interfaces and I actually saw a network packet come in and corrupt
memory.  I also have similar reports from other about disk subsystems.
