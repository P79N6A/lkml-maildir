Nothing should break.  Linux does not require userspace to be recompiled.
Binaries from the 0.99 days still run today.  An exception to this would
be ioctls that were introduced during the 2.5 cycle as they have not
appeared in a stable release yet.
Also, please remember that the size part of the ioctl is only a hint.
Very few things really care about it (which is why the breakage wasn't
discovered before).
