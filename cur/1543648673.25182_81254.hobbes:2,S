Why not let the security module supply the information about the
struct layout?
I'm thinking of something roughly like stdarg.h, e.g.
    #include <linux/user_args.h>
    user_args args;
    user_args_start(&args, ptr);
where args is some variable where user_args can save internal state
and ptr is the pointer to the struct from userland (which is
translated appropriately to a kernel space pointer; maybe also a size
argument might be handy, so that you can copy the struct from
userspace memory to kernel memory at once instead of accessing user
address space for every struct member individually), then
    struct.longlongmember = user_args_get(&args, long long);
which applies the right alignment, translates 32bit to 64bit etc.
Due to complexity probably one wants to restrict that to a set of
common types instead of making it full generic (and e.g. use something
like user_args_get_longlong() instead of the type argument), but I
don't think this would be a serious restriction (you can always extend
it later if you really need another type to get through).
This wouldn't work on an architecture where members following later in
a struct could affect the alignment of previous members, but are there
any (sane) architectures around where this is the case? Personally I
can't think of any reason why one possibly wanted to do that...
