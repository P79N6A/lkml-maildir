this I don't understand. what makes your approach 25x faster?
looking at the comparison of a 500G filesystem with 500G of ram allocated 
for a buffer cache.
yes, initially it will be a bit slower (until the files get into the 
buffer cache), and if fsync is disabled all writes will go to the buffer 
cache (until writeout hits)
I may be able to see room for a few percent difference, but not 2x, let 
alone 25x.
