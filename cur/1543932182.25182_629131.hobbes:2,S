The atl1 code will be heavily reworked in the 2.6.25 merge window, so this may 
cause headaches.  Please remove these chunks before merging.
The spelling corrections themselves are fine, and I will ensure that the revised 
driver includes them, if the comments in question are still present at all once 
we're done with all the changes and cleanups.
