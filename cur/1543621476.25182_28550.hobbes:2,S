Yep, I understand.  When I was patching in rmap12f I had to manually
merge the little bit into mm/bootmem.c and the offset was several hundred
lines.  Then I realized just how much WLI's bootmem patch changes.

Actually, I'm going to recompile -mjc2 without lock breaking to see if that
helps.  Then try without prempt altogether.  If either of those two fix the
problem, I'll see if I can reproduce against the latest kernel from marcello
and your latest patch and merge myself.  Heh, I want to keep testing -mjc.
There are so many nice things in there. ;)
