actually, it was via a raw disk under irix.  And block devices under Linux 
show the same results if you flush the cache first.  See flushdisk.c for
the Linux version of doing that.

Sure, I did it over the protests of other people and I learned something,
you have every right to do the same thing.  In fact, it's great that you
are doing it.  Just don't get all bent out of shape if you tweaking the 
elevator alg does nothing (in SunOS under most workloads the default was
99.4% as good as every other one I tried, and I tried a bunch.  I then
went to screw with the pageout daemon and learned a similar lesson:
paging out pages is insane, you want to page on inodes, but that's
a rant for another day).

Insert a ring buffer into the disk sort entry point.  Add a userland process
which reads this ring buffer and gets the actual requests in the actual order
they are sent to the drive[s].  Then take that data and write a simulator into
which you can plug in different algs.  I have all this crud for SunOS if you
want it, including elevator.c, hacksaw.c, and inorder.c.  Then you run your
test cases given what you know about seek time and rot delay and see what 
your changes would do.
If you do all this, write a paper, Usenix loves this junk.

raw disks?  block disks?  both work.
