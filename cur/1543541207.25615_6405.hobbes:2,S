No, Linda is right, the issue is deeper.  I think the answer is that only inheritance setting not
inheritance resolution is affected by chroot (though when we implement symbolic inheritance that
will be affected by chroot).
There are two types of inheritance, traversal and pulled, where traversal means you specified that
everything below some directory inherits something, and pulled means that you specified that a file
will inherit from somewhere else.  Traversal inheritance should have no effect on processes that
have already chdir'd to below.  Think of this as being the definition of that semantic, you are not
changing the value for everything below, you are changing the value for everything that goes through
you to get below.  
Thanks Linda, your question forced me to define things much better.
