Fwiw, I think truncate *should* extend the reservation.  We have a
separate thread arguing about whether we should be reserving by inode
length, as I've implemented, or by which ranges are actually mapped
(as apw's old path implemented).  As long as it *is* by inode length -
so it's conceptually all about the logical file in hugetlbfs, not
about any of its mappings - I think it makes sense for an extending
truncate() to extend the reservation.  It's not reserving them for any
particular mapping, it's reserving them for page cache pages.
