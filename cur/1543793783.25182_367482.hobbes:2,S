Hello,
Please see : 
http://www.gemtek.lt/~zilvinas/dumps/trace
 
This time I didn't see oops printed again :( Don't understand why,
although I have managed to capture SysRQ-T output - see URL above.
Kernel has been updated this morning to revision:
f6ff56cd56b83d8edf4b3cffc5c53c56b37a5081 
plus additionally applied patch from URL. Interesting this time I
haven't seen any signs of slab corruptions or any such things :(
I hope this helps. Any other ideas and things to try out ? :)
btw, what are these messages about:
 Unknown notification: subtype=40,flags=0xa0,size=40
I've read a ipw2200.c code and didn't see what is subtype=40 ...
Because once those messages are starting showing up - immediately (most
of the time) follows by kernel freeze (sysrq is working though ...).
