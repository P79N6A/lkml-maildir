sorry, but... yes, it was meant as "I am ready to help" :) but 
definitely I am not the right person to start to change this document. I 
can assist as linux user who need some information about bug reporting 
and how/why I should use sources from kernel.org at all. I have no idea 
what is desired by kernel developers (obviously they need good reports 
from informed users and less annoying traffic in LKML...maybe this 
letter is similar, sorry) but I have seen that those old school 
enthusiasts who are going to compile their custom kernel after every new 
release or -ac - they are not happy 'cause something which was part of 
their life (faster, smaller and maybe safer custom system) is now quite 
hard to achieve. Explanation would be nice for them, maybe even in 
kernel README.
thanks,
Indrek
