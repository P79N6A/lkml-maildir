Yup.
Adding 7 extra void*'s seems to affect only dbench, which
whose degration with the nsproxy falls outside the noise.
The odd thing isn't so much the degradation, but the widely
scattered values, compared to without nsproxy.
           |  with nsproxy  |   without nsproxy |
kernbench  | 70.23 +/- 0.27 |   70.04 +/- 0.22  |
dbench     | 367.1 +/- 32.6 |   410.0 +/- 2.96  |
tbench     | 399.3 +/- 12.4 |   399.4 +/- 12.5  |
