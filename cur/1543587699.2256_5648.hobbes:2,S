That sounds like a good idea actually, under kernel hacking perhaps?  It
seems to me that the messages do indicate some kind of non-fatal problem
(that may not be true?) but I agree it is murderous to /var on a small
system.  Given that I now consider a small system one with a /var of under
300 megs, well..  =)

Techical solutions are not a matter of voting. Two legislations in the US
states almost decided that the value of Pi be 3.14, exactly. Popular vote
does not make for a correct solution.
