Not quite a "crash", but definitely after I noticed the system no
longer doing any useful work. As I said before, it was as if anything
to do with timers was not working (e.g., sleep 1s).

It will be an hour or so before I can try either of these,
I have a build in progress. I can check both of these with the new
build (or the old one if you want that too).
