Of course I linked it with libc compiled with regparm=3.

BTW. libc headers surround all function parameters with __P, like
extern int printf __P ((__const char* __format, ...));
so you can change in include/sys/cdefs.h
#define __P(x) x
into
#define __P(x) x __attribute__((regparm(0)))
and compile programs with -mregparm=3 -ffreestanding even on normal linux
distribution. I didn't try it for larger program, for simple it works. (it
works as long as program doesn't call libc function via pointer to
function).
(without -ffreestanding gcc sometimes emits calls to library functions on
its own, and uses calling convention from command line, not convention
from prototype).
