It's better you do it. I don't know anything about the specifics of
early initialization. Just Cc linux1394-devel on submission so that we
can have a look at the OHCI-1394 related bits.
Using linux1394-2.6.git could only be helpful if more code sharing
between ohci1394.c and ohci1394_early.c would be desired. That's
questionable though, given the rather small size of ohci1394_early.c.

Thanks, I wasn't aware that firescope actually does fill this gap.
