...and what would your beefs (beeves?) with kbuild-2.5 be? I searched the archives
for the last 12 months and I don't see anythinng from you relevant to kbuild-2.5.
Keith has been addressing concerns quite regularly; I should think if you have
constructive comments, he'd surely listen. 
You *do* have constructive comments, right?
