If it compiles.. Otherwise use gcc-3.0.3(prerelease), it has fixes that makes 
the _current_ kernel compile.

Obviously it's still full of bugs, it wouldn't really be gcc if it wasn't.

I am currently running a linux-2.4.16-gcc3, where the only changed part is 
the use of the gcc-3.0 compiler, and a -foptimize-siblings-calls flag. It's 
running smoothly, although I havn't done any performance test yet.
Btw. I havent found anything that compiles with gcc-3.1 yet.
