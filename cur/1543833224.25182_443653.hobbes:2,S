I track the code bask as far as I could and back to about 2000 in
pthread.c when the code was introduced it always used sys_sysctl.

The evidence and ideally what has to be there?

Well there are embedded targets but I guess uclibc takes care of them.
Unless a darn good reason for keeping it is found, sys_sysctl won't be
in the kernel several months from now.  And uname is faster by a large
margin than /proc.
Right now because there has been a deprecated note in
"include/linux/sysctl.h" since 2003 people currently feel fine with
letting sys_sysctl code bit rot.  I am trying to resolve that
situation most likely by just updating the few stray pieces of user
space that care and then cutting out that chunk of kernel code.
