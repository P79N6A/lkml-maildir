No, udev cannot help here because any of the two modules may already
be loaded when you plug in your device. You also need to get the kernel space
probing corrected. Basically you have three options.
1. Make both drivers handle the issue. That means code duplication
2. Make the option driver fail gracefully in probe()
3. Make sure usbcore doesn't probe the devices in the wrong mode with the 
option driver
