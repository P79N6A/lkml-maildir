I've started the fine-tests and can say so far that dpt_i2o from 
2.6.22 is still fine. Test is simple:
anders@ista:/usr/src/linux-2.6.22/drivers/scsi/dpt$ cp -r dpt/ dpt_i2o.c dpti.h /usr/src/linux-2.6.23.1/drivers/scsi/
... recompile the kernel, reboot: works.
2.6.22 and 2.6.23 differ in terms of the dpt_i2o driver by two different
patch sets:
-one 2 Kb small set of patches from 2.6.22 to 2.6.22-rc1
-one 7 Kb set of patches from 2.6.23-rc2 to 2.6.23-rc3
-one 162 Kb set of patches from 2.6.23-rc9 to 2.6.23-rc10.
When applying the 2.6.23-rc1-based driver to "my" 2.6.31.1 kernel,
the "zero blocks"-symptom show up, so it's the "lucky" situation
that the smallest patch actually seams to be the broken one.
According to the 2.6.23-rc1 short-form changelog, there is
one major edit on the dpt_i2o driver:
FUJITA Tomonori 
      [SCSI] dpt_i2o: convert to use the data buffer accessors
Stephen Rothwell 
      dpt_i2o depends on virt_to_bus
Fujita, would you please take a look at this?
I think that something's broken in there, leading to the dpt_i2o 
sending out blocks of zeroes right after initialization, at least on
some specific controllers (in this case, Adaptec 2010S on Intel
SE7501WV2S-based boxes).
I don't have insight kernel driver development knowledge, so I'm
quite out of help right now. Nevertheless, I'll add the diff
from 2.6.22 to 2.6.23-rc1 in terms of dpt_i2o:

Personally I guess that it's the large drop from lines 2164 on
that's broken, who replaces a mapping routine by some static assignment.
