I'm currently working on getting complete support for Geforce FX for RivaFB.
Thanks to X's open source NV module, I have already gotten it to work 
completely for monitor. I am still having trouble with TV out though. The 
only working reference I have for that though is the binary, closed source, 
official Nvidia X module.
I know very little about kernel hacking, the support that I got working at all 
was mostly by pure guessing and trial and error. I would like some advice 
about what actions I should take next in getting more complete support.
