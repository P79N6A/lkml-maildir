   Come on Pavel, in order to make this happen, you have to
   	a) run the installer as root
   	b) know the next pid which will be allocated
   	c) put the symlink in /tmp/installer$pid
Exploit: Make all 65535 $pid simlinks
It's very exploitable actually, and is similar in vein to
all the ancient mktemp stuff.
