I've been running the daemon for quite some time, however, have noticed 
something on my newest computer.  It's a core2 duo and the IRQ balance 
daemon always exits after some time.  After looking at the source, I see 
it's because dual core/hyperthreaded boxes (single domain caches) always 
get treated as though the --oneshot option were passed and exit after 
the first pass (I assume same thing happens on quad cores?).
Does this not adversely affect IRQ balancing on those CPU's?  If the IRQ 
load of a mostly idle device changes from when the daemon was run, 
wouldn't the inability of the balance to adjust it adversely affect 
performance if the load changes at a later time? I'm used to my old SMP 
box with 2 physical cores, so this is just something I've wondered about 
on the new box.  Thanks,
-Walt
