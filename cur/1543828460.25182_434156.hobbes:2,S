I would think that batched write is pretty essential then to FUSE
performance.  If we could then get the glibc authors to not sabotage the
using of a large block size to indicate that we like large IOs (see
thread on fseek implementation), reiser4 and FUSE would be all set for
improved performance.  Even without glibc developer cooperation, we will
get a lot of benefits.
