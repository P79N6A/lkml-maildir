[SNIPPED...]
33 MHz machines easily handle 6,000 interrupts per second --
unless you are trying to execute code within that interrupt
that requires 1/6000th of a second to execute!  Perhaps it's
not a "latency" problem, but an interrupt code-bloat problem
where most of the stuff should be executed out of the interrupt
context.
There are timer queues and kernel threads available that might
help you. Also a tightly-coupled user-mode daemon that uses
your driver only to interface with the hardware and not do
any "logic" is probably the way to go.
Cheers,
