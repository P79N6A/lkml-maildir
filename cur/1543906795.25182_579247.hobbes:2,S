i tried to convince distro folks about it ... but there's fear, 
uncertainty and doubt about touching /etc/fstab and i suspect no major 
distro will do it until another does it - which is a catch-22 :-/ So i 
guess we should add a kernel config option that allows the kernel rpm 
maker to just disable atime by default. (re-enableable via boot-line and 
fstab entry too) [That new kernel config option would be disabled by 
default.] That makes it much easier to control and introduce.
