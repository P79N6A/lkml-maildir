Most of the fbdev drivers use the PCI bus mechanism to find their
hardware. Some of the ones that don't run in boxes that don't have a
PCI bus. I don't know of any PCI based fbdev drivers not using the PCI
support, what is an example of one?

It a problem with X because shouldn't be messing with hardware
controlled by a device driver loaded by the kernel. My choice of
kernel device drivers I have loaded should not break X if X was
obeying the rules.

The DRM modules don't use PCI support for locating their cards.
Instead they use a convoluted scheme where the X server tell them
which cards to bind to. The fbdev drivers should be using the normal
PCI system.
Look in include/pci.h, there is an API for accessing the ROMs. The
signature is verified just to make sure that the right ROM was found.
That check only fails when your hardware is messed up. There are three
(sti, matrox, sis) fbdev drivers directly manipulating their ROM when
they should be using the ROM API.

 Look at the radeon
driver for an example.
Don't use the code in DRM CVS that loops over the PCI devices checking
to see if they are bound or not. That code was only there as a way to
work around fbdev, merging with fbdev eliminates the need for it.

This is accurate, the problems are caused by the various drivers
conflicting. Get rid of multiple drivers and the conflicts go away.

Historically fbdev existed first and DRM came along later so they have
always been split. The OS independent model of X and DRM made sense in
the 90s, but now Linux has advanced to the point where this no longer
makes sense. It's time to update our thinking on how video works.

There is plenty of work to do on graphics and lots of flame wars too.
