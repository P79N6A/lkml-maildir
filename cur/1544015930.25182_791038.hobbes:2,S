It's not specific to Intel, but it is a specific compatibility behavior.

How else do you propose implementing IRQ handling in e.g. the RT kernel?
We get a hardware interrupt, we can't FastEOI, we can't process
synchronously, we can't do all of those things you might expect.
Implementing RT requires that we delay handling of the IRQ until
arbitrarily later in the future when we get around to it.
