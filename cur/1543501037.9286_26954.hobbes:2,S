Excuse me,
I recently posted a patch ("Interceptors 0.3")
and recieved no response :-(.
As I can understand, the patch is rejected.
But what is the reason?
Is the patch not needed? Or it contains significant bugs?
Or more functionality is required? Or it simply was not recieved?
Please do not ignore this message. This is the very practical question for
me.
Am I allowed to continue the improving of the patch?
What are the rules for such situations? (This is my first patch and I am
disoriented).
                    Thanks.
                                Alexander.
