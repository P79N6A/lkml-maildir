I would believe it if I knew people using suspend/resume on the other OS.
But that's not the case either. Also, it happens that with today's RAM
sizes, suspend-to-disk then resume can be several times slower than a
clean fresh boot. When you have 1 GB to write at 20 MB/s, it takes 50
seconds to shut down, and as much to restart. Compare this to 5-10
seconds for a shutdown and 30-50 seconds for a cold boot, and it might
give you another clue why there are people not interested in such a
feature.
