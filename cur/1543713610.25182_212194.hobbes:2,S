Subject: Workaround for ReiserFS on root-filesystem

Hi Folks!
I use ReiserFS for my root-filesystem while trying to upgrade to a newer 
kernel-version (still using 2.4.20) I got a error, that / could not be 
remounted read/write. After googling a bit I stumbled over the fact that 
ReiserFS as root-filesystem doesn't work since version 2.4.22 (or 
something like this).
So I asked myself if there exists any workaround/howto/something-else so 
   I could get away from making my root-fs to an ext3 one. Does anyone 
know something about it?
Thanks,
	Thomas Bach
