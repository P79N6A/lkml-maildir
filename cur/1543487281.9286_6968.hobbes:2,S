Mostly because for the majority of people who have an IRQ conflict between a 
parallel port and a soundcard, it works better to do things that way.  
If parport grabbed the IRQ and registered it in /proc then the soundcard 
would fail to initialise.  This is better from the point of view of debugging 
the system but would infuriate people who upgrade from an older kernel and 
find that all of a sudden their sound system is broken.
