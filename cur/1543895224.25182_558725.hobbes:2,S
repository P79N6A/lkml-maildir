most people who report bugs don't know enough about what's actually going 
wrong to be able to write a test case (those that do can probably just 
write a patch to fix it). Along similar lines a debugger wouldn't be of 
much use either.
the fact that git-bisect doesn't require any knowledge other then 
knowledge the reporter has demonstrated that they already have (the 
ability to compile and install their own kernel) puts it within the reach 
of testers.
unfortunantly, as good as it is it can take a lot of effort, especially if 
the bug takes time to show up. it's not perfect, but it's a huge help.
and developers aren't always responding with 'do a bisect', sometimes they 
respond with 'yes, we know about that' or 'that sounds like X', so it's 
still worthwhile for people to report the problem first before going to 
the ffort of doing a bisect.
