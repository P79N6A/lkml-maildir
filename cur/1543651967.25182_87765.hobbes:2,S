Hi folks,
I have a question regarding the sysctl-API. I create a new directory
structure (proc/sys/net/foo) that includes some files and a directory
that contains no files in the beginning (/proc/sys/net/foo/bar/). The
files in this directory can be registered later during runtime
(proc/net/foo/bar/1). They can also be unregisterd. If I unregister the
last file in this directory, the directory itself (the bar directory)
will also be removed. However, in my understanding this directory is
still a child of the ctl_table that creates the initial directory
structure and that also contains /proc/net/foo/bar. What am I doing
wrong?
Regards,
Tino
