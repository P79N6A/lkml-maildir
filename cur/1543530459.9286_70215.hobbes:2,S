Well, with XFree86-4, the DGA extension as been updated to v2 from v1.1
and is said to allow depth change. But it's an XFree86 extension and is
not provided by other Xservers.
So you may change it while a program hold the whole screen, but not for
general use (ie changing depth a la windows, wm and other X apps won't
accept it nicely :-) )
