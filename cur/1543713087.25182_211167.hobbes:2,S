Hello,
    When I compile the kernel2.4.16 and I get a kernel panic when I reboot the
m/c with the new kernel. I have a redhat 9.0 version and  when I use the
sources in the /usr/src/linux.x.x.x they work fine for me. by doing the nm
linux/vmlinux i get the EIP as c01070a6 and the function it points is
do_signal. I have sony vaio laptop 2.4 ghz, celeron.
    I need linux2.4.16 because i want to use LTT and the documentation of LTT
says that it can be used with that version. Can somebody gimme sm pointer
realted to this.
Thanks,
Amit Khandelwal
