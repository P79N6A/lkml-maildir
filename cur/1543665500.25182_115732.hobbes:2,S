No...

Red Hat 8.0 boots directly from the ISO filesystem, IIUC. Plus "floppy
booting" mostly means using FreeDOS + syslinux, or even an ext2 floppy with
lilo or grub. The "floppy booting" discussed here is doing:
   dd if=bzImage of=/dev/fd0
and booting that floppy directly. I really don't remember when I did that
last time, it must have been at least 5 years ago.
Embedded systems I've seen do strange shenanigans with custom bootloaders
to get the kernel into RAM, no floppy involved.
