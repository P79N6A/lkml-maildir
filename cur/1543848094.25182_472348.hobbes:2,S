per file" is not the purpose of configfs.
	The purpose of configfs is to allow userspace to create and manipulate
kernel objects whose lifetime is under the control of userspace. That
perfectly matches the idea of being able to create, manipulate, and
destroy a resource group from userspace.
	"one value per file" is a phrase describing what configfs and sysfs
files should normally look like. However it's not a rule since there is
precedent for sysfs files that require parsing:
/sys/devices/pciXXXX:XX/XXXX:XX:XX.X/resource
/sys/block/hda/stat
/sys/block/hda/dev
	These are counterexamples to your assertion below that "one value per
file" is a rule.

	This conflicts with the idea of reusing kernel code that was made to be
reused. Except for this 1 page limit configfs is nearly a perfect match.
I doubt we'd get a favorable reaction if we said:
	"OK, let's copy configfs then remove the page size limit."

Please see my counterexample above.

	We dropped RCFS more than 1 year ago after feedback suggested we should
try to share as much kernel code as possible. Other than the 1 page
limit to the list of pids, configfs is a perfect match for what we need.
