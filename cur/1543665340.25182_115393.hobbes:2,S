It seems (and CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK also seems to contribute)
        init_MUTEX(&ni->mrec_lock);
	        ...
		INIT_LIST_HEAD(...)
and IMHO that shouldn't happen :) But you have the infamous 2.96
compiler, there were several updates for Red Hat [remember how buggy
code it complied?] but I don't know how many updates were issued for
Mandrake and if you did those. gcc 3.2.2 generates much nicer code for
__ntfs_init_inode.
