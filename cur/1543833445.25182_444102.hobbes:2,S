Real AT keyboards (that's what we are trying to emulate here) send
0x54 scancode (and 0xB4 break code) if PrintScreen/SysRq key is
pressed while holding Alt (left or right). Otherwise it sends e0 2a e0
37. That's it.

We never supressed sysrq scancodes from reaching userspace if keyboard
is in raw mode (2.4 works the same). Plus you won't be able to supress
it for keyboards working in hadware raw mode (kbd_rawcode is called
even before we get to detecting SysRq state). Also users getting
keyboard events from alternative interfaces (such as evdev) won't be
affected anyway so I think we shoudl leave it as is.
