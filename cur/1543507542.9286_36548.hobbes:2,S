I can't find anything in the documentation specific to revision numbers.
The fact that this bit has the same function from VP2/97 all the way
through to Apollo Pro leads me to believe this bit has the same function
for all VIA chipsets.
In any case:
1106:1595 - VP2/97 (yes, _1595_ - new version of 0595 which is VP2)
1106:0597 - VP3
1106:0598 - MVP3
1106:0691 - Apollo Pro
