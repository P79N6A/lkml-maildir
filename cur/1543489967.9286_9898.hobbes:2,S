Hi,
unfortunately I have a Logitech wheelmouse (M-S48 OEM according to the
sticker). When I "cat /dev/psaux | xxd", playing around with the wheel
does not give any output. Does this mouse need some special
initialization? Could this be handled with a user level program or is this
a kernel problem? 
Just wanted to report this problem - bye!
Patrick
