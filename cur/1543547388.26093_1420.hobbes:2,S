The kernel debugger in NT is text based and runs remotely only.  It's
very powerful and has facilties built in for debugging nested page
faults and structured exceptions, SMP deadlocks, conditional
breakpoints, and tons of other stuff not in Linux.  Since Linux doesn't
even support structured exception handling, it's not even a fair
comparison between the two.
