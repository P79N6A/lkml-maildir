In the next version, I'm removing the per page pointer for container.
address_space already has a container pointer, I'm adding a pointer in
anon_vma as well.  And that does seem to be complicating the accounting
just a wee bit.  Though on its own, it is not helping the reclaim part. 
I'll have to see how to handle kernel pages w/o a per page pointer.

If there are multiple containers that a process can hop to then yes that
will happen.
