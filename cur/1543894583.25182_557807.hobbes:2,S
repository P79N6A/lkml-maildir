i fully support the notion you articulate, that whether bin-only modules 
are part of a derivative work of the kernel or whether they are 
independent works is not an automatic thing at all. The answer is: "it 
depends, talk to your lawyer". For example i'd say VMWare's ESX bin-only 
module is likely derived from the Linux kernel and should be distributed 
under the GPL, but that for example the ATI and nvidia drivers, although 
being a large PITA for all of us, are possibly independent works.
but lets note that this is irrelevant to the Tivo argument. Tivo is not 
using bin-only modules AFAIK, all their source code is available for 
download. (their kernel source is totally uninteresting by the way - 
they have some weird crap IDE controller with hacks that will never go 
upstream.)
