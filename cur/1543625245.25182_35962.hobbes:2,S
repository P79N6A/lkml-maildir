True. (Old programs *will* perceive the value as 0xFFFFFFFF if it is
RLIM_INFINITY; the kernel clips it to 0x7FFFFFFF in sys_old_getrlimit() but
glibc expands it again in __new_getrlimit().)

Looking a bit closer at the particular SIGXFS that kills fsck (in
generic_file_write) there's some S_ISBLK stuff going on just below.
Is the fix just as simple as: (untested) (and with a mailer than mangles
tabs)

   if (pos >= limit) {
    send_sig(SIGXFSZ, current, 0);
    goto out;
   }
All this rlimit stuff is a bit wonky in the presence of 64-bit file sizes
anyway. Perhaps if we fix just the block-device case we can brush the rest
under the carpet?
