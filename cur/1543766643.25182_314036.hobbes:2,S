I don't get it. I do have to change hfsplus_fill_super to free 
sb->s_fs_info, don't I? If I just nullify it there, there will be a
leak, and if I don't, put_super won't know it shouldn't do anything.
This try brings in less changes, but I don't see how to do even less:
(pseudo-patch that won't apply, just to know):
