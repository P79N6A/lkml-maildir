Well, the comment is wrong. The code doesn't actually visit 'gate_vma' if 
the list of VMA's is empty.
Not that the old code did either, so it's not like it's a new bug, but I 
thought I'd point it out anyway. As if we care (but you can probably 
trigger this by having an app that does
	munmap(NULL, TASK_SIZE);
which will cause a SIGSEGV on return (because the stack doesn't exist) and 
then the core-dump should be empty.
Not that I tested anythign that evil anyway, nor do I think we really care 
if it means that the gate_vma doesn't get shown in the core-dump either.
