Hi there,
I tried a while ago to subscribe to linux-{kernel,raid}, but my
request has not been approved. It usually doesn't take days to
subscribe to a mailing list, does it?
Anyway, if the maintainers are busy, please don't see this as
a flame. I understand the situation, I am just asking for
reconsideration to have the following two addresses added
respectively:
  linux-kernel=vger.kernel.org (at) mass.madduck.net
  linux-raid=vger.kernel.org (at) mass.madduck.net
I appreciate your time!
