I will try to get numbers for both.
I would be surprised if it was a big loss... but I'm assuming
a locked cmpxchg isn't outlandishly expensive. Basically:
   read_lock_irqsave(cacheline1);
   atomic_inc_return(cacheline2);
   read_unlock_irqrestore(cacheline1);
Turns into
   atomic_cmpxchg();
I'll do some microbenchmarks and get back to you. I'm quite
interested now ;) What sort of AMDs did you have in mind,
Opterons?
Thanks,
Nick
