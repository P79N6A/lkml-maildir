i'd suggest the solution from exec-shield (which has been there for a 
long time), which also randomizes the vsyscall vma. Exploits are already 
starting to use the vsyscall page (with predictable addresses) to 
circumvent randomization, it provides 'interesting' instructions to act 
as a syscall-functionality building block. Moving that address to 
another predictable place solves the virtualization problem, but doesnt 
solve the address-space randomization problem.
