You can't do that right now because core_pattern doesn't support slashes.
The coredumps will be always all over the fs or not be there at all
if the cwd is write protected.
In my patch I allowed pipes and piped the coredump into a user space
processor that generated a simple report using gdb and sent it off.
The web frontend then did some statistics on what crashed most.
