Percentages would be pure guesswork, but I do have _some_ numbers.
For (1), I have no idea. Furthermore, I would think that if a user can 
suspend with Suspend2, they should be able to suspend with swsusp. There 
were 2 driver related patches I had that swsusp doesn't, with I sent to 
Andrew and to John Stultz this morning for consideration. The one sent to 
Andrew might make some people be able to suspend with Suspend2 who 
couldn't with swsusp, but I couldn't see how the timer related one I sent 
to John could make a difference (so I asked for his evaluation). Given 
that the right thing happens with them, I guess merging Suspend2 should 
make virtually zero difference to whatever the answer might be to #1.
Now to #2.I haven't seen download statistics for Suspend2 since last May. 
At that time, we had a release that was current for about 3 months. During 
that time, there were 12,000 downloads of the version (2.1.8 IIRC). Let's 
say that half of them actually applied the software and used it. Does 6000 
people make it worth it? Of course, having said that, I don't know how 
many people would be more likely to use it if it was in mainline and they 
didn't have to patch their kernels, but I'd suspect it would be at least 
that number again.
Hope that helps.
Nigel
