This incorporates the latest round of BenH's fixes and changes, but 
backs out the PCI suspend changes, which need independent review and testing.  
(BenH has promised a little more work before he's ready to sign off, 
 hence the -WIP2 designation)
The following patch contains a rewrite of radeonfb's suspend/resume code 
to use standard PCI subsystem calls.  It applies to 2.6.19-rc6 and also 
on top of the v7-WIP2 patch.

Christian, if you could see if the latter patch (on top of the -v6b or 
-WIP2 patches) makes a difference for your suspend/resume problems..
And with these patches, I'm going to drop offline for a camping trip 
over the weekend.  I'll pick this stuff back up on Monday.
