I just received permission from the IEEE and the Open Group
to distribute part of POSIX 1003.1-2003.
Wrote some silly script to convert these things to nroff
and put man-pages-1.65 at the usual places.
People who like to see POSIX pages first put
MANSECT=1p:1:8:0p:3p:2:3:4:5:6:7:9:tcl:n:l:p:o
or so in their environment (or edit /usr/share/misc/man.conf).
Other put 0p:1p:3p later in this ordering.
0p is headers, 1p is utilities, 3p is functions.
No doubt the output of my script will have a thousand flaws,
but I am ill right now and do not want to look at them.
Of course, comments are welcome.
