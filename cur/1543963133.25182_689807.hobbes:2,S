This is a WARN_ON_ONCE so you only see it once per boot. Resume does
not count :) You might change that WARN_ON_ONCE to WARN_ON to check
whether it happens more than once.

Thanks. That's why I put the WARN_ON there. The backtrace attracts
attention and it's also an interesting info that this did not happen
on boot, where we read out the RTC as well.
Can you please provide some details about the system ?
