First, please CC your emails to me, since I'm not subscribed.
Secondly, I know C, but I'm not anywhere near what you'd call a kernel
hacker.  So dumb things down for me, but not _too_ much :)
Also note that I use Linux 2.2.15, as much as I would want to use 2.4,
I don't feel like it would be keen of me to switch to a development kernel
until this release kernel's driver works.
Anyway, What I'm doing is scanning the PCI bus, and finding the one
or more cards that have 16mb of on-board memory.  base_address[0] if you
will.  I AND that with PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_IO_MASK, and register a device
major and minor for the device.
A userland program will now attempt to mmap the device.  It requests
exactly 16mb.  Everything seems ok until I try to read or write to this
memory.  It gives me a kernel complaint:
do_wp_page: bogus page at address 4017400 (72000000)
base_address[0] is 0xF2000008, and with the mask, F2000000.  According to
the device's documentation, both are acceptable (for what they are).
I've also pasted in my entire mmap handler:
(please excuse me if this email is a bit long)
int device_mmap(struct file * filp, struct vm_area_struct * vma)
{
	int id = MINOR(filp->f_dentry->d_inode->i_rdev)-1;
	/* this id is supposed to be -1 */
	e4DevT *dev = &devTable[id];
	{
		unsigned long off = vma->vm_offset;
		unsigned long physical=dev->ioaddr+off+PAGE_OFFSET;
		unsigned long vsize=vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start;
		unsigned long psize=dev->ioaddr - off;
		if (off & (PAGE_SIZE-1))
		{
			printk("mmap: page unaligned\n");
			return -ENXIO;
		}
		if (vsize > psize)
		{
			printk("too high\n");
			return -EINVAL;
		}
		if (remap_page_range(vma->vm_start, physical, vsize, vma->vm_page_prot))
			return 0;
	}
	printk("mmap (remap_page_range) device #%d successful\n",id);
	/* this message is printed */
	return 0;
}
Thanks for your assistance.
P.S. There needs to be reference/documentation for all these functions,
something easier to grep.
