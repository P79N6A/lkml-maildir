As such this patch looks fine, and is certainly harmless.  But don't we
also need to address the issue that .text.head is not listed in the
linker script?
i.e.  Don't we also need?
  .text : AT(ADDR(.text) - LOAD_OFFSET) {
  	_text = .;			/* Text and read-only data */
+	*(.text.head)
	*(.text)
	SCHED_TEXT
	LOCK_TEXT
	KPROBES_TEXT
	*(.fixup)
	*(.gnu.warning)
  	_etext = .;			/* End of text section */
  } :text = 0x9090
I'm not even certain how the i386 kernel links properly without the above.
