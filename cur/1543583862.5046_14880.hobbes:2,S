Alan, AFAICS they never remove entries, they only do adds and lookups by
string key and they keep the whole thing in memory all the time. Oh, and
they don't give it too hard use, to put it mildly.
IOW, I'm pretty sure that even a LRU list will be sufficient. Hash definitely
will be enough. Any *db is an overkill here - it's a symbol table, for fsck
sake...
