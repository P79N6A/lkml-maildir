I beg to differ, sir!
In my rewritten code, the "zeropage" is 4K of zero-initialized .bss,
into which the setup header is copied.
So any undefined field will be initialized to zero, not to whatever
assembly code happened to be there.
You know that with the old code, we got boot failures after changing the
error message in the dummy boot sector?
