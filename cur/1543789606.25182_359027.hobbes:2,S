If it tries to use interrupt 0, yes.

Yes.  Yes.
However, I've patched my kernel to initialize the HPET manually
because my BIOS doesn't bother to do it at all.  A quick Google search
shows that in most cases where the BIOS _does_ bother, the third timer
(which is the only free one after system timer and RTC have grabbed
theirs) didn't get initialized and is still set to interrupt 0 (which
isn't actually supported by most HPET hardware).
This means that hpet.c must initialize the interrupt routing register
in this case.  I'll write a patch for this.
Regards,
Clemens
