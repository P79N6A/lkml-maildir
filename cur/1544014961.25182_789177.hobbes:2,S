The static inlining by default (unfortunately) saves a lot of text size.
For testing I built an x86-64 allyesconfig kernel with 
-fno-inline-functions-called-once (which disables the default static
inlining), and it increased text size by ~4.1% (over 2MB for a allyesconfig 
kernel). So I think we have to keep that, dropping it would cost too
much :/
