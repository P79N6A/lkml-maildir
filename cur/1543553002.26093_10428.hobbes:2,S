I just guess the end result will be as crash prone as Netware when you install any third
party software ;) 
lazy mm is probably a better path, as long as you stay in kernel threads and a single user mm
it'll never switch VMs.

Interesting. You could do easily the same in Linux by changing (in 2.2) the SAVE_ALL macro
in arch/i386/kernel/irq.h and doing the same in ret_from_intr's RESTORE_ALL macro (after
changing it to a RESTORE_ALL_INT or you'll break system calls) 
Actually I don't even know why irq.h's SAVE_ALL even loads __KERNEL_CS, it should be already
set by the interrupt gate. __KERNEL_DS probably needs to be still loaded, but only when
you came from user space.
