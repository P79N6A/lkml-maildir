Hi,
I am trying to attach a special serial input device to an X application.
Looking at the kernel document, it seems to me the input core system (the
/dev/input/event#) fits the my needs nicely.  I also realize that the input
system uses the devfs rather than the traditional major/minor number for its
device driver.
So I configured a 2.4.18-5 kernel with the following flags turned on,
	- devfs turned on,
	- the input core module,
	- the input core's keyboard and mouse modules
	- the input core's event modules
The kernel compiles fine.  However, during boot process, everything under
the /var/* and several device mounts were marked as read-only and thus the
kernel fails to boot.  I tried to set the devfs=nomount as its boot
parameter.  It didn't help either.
Thanks in advance!
