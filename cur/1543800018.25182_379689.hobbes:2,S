Wrong.  RTFS, please.  They have
	spread = 0xffffffff;
	while (....) {
		...
		if (nspread < spread) {
			spread = nspread;
			...
			goal_eloc = eloc;
			...
		}
		...
	}
	...
	if (spread == 0xffffffff) {
		...
		return 0;
	}
	....
	use goal_eloc
which is absolutely correct - to reach the use of goal_eloc we have to
have passed through reassignment of spread between spread = 0xffffffff
and departure via if (spread == 0xffffffff).  Such reassignment could
happen only in one block and in the same block we have assignment to
goal_eloc.
