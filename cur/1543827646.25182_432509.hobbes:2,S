That's nice. Thank you.
Please review the following files before posting the patches :
  Documentation/CodingStyle
  Documentation/SubmittingDrivers
  Documentation/SubmittingPatches
and make sure you've cleaned up the code to follow CodingStyle -
otherwise that's just going to be the first thing people will tell you
to fix :-)
Also make sure you include appropriate "Signed-off-by:" lines on the
patches and please post patches inline, not as attachments (and please
test send those mails to yourself first and check that the patches
apply and have not been mangled by your email client).

I don't have the appropriate hardware, but I'd still be interrested in
taking a look at the patches, and I'm sure many other people feel the
same way.
I'd say posting the patches on LKML and adding relevant people/lists
from the MAINTAINERS file to Cc would be the way to do it.
