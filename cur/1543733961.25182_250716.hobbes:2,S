No, it's the mmap PROT check that's the issue.

Thing is, x86 makes no distinction btween r/x so, have you tried mmaping
with read, then executing (I haven't)?  If it works, then you may find
that there are dumb things out there that do that as well (which you
wouldn't be able to protect, and become one attack vector).  You can make
a file read-only (no exec bits), and still execute it with ld.so.  Same
as bash can interpret readonly shell script files.  Now, ld.so _will_
mmap PROT_EXEC, so it works for you.

This has nothing to do with file permissions aside of read.  All you need
is read permission, then you can mmap(PROT_EXEC) which will kick off the
check, and do deny_write_access.  It's a freeform way to lock writers
out of any readable file in the system.  This is why MAP_EXECUTABLE and
MAP_DENYWRITE are masked off at syscall entry.
