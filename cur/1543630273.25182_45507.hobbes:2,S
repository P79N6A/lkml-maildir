It doesn't make much sense that way, but if you also made the
descriptions shorter (first line only) _and_ then packed them, it would
give a much denser overview. Oh, and remove any [PATCH] marker: I just
use them to keep track of which were imported as email-patches vs which
were done "natively" with BK..
So you'd have something like:
	jsimmons@heisenberg.transvirtual.com:
		A bunch of fixes.
		Pmac updates
		Some more small fixes.
	rmk@arm.linux.org.uk:
		2.5.13: vmalloc link failure
	trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no:
		in_ntoa link failure
	viro@math.psu.edu:
		change_floppy() fix
which I could more easily post to linux-kernel (possibly after some
minor hand-editing) because it wouldn't end up being 20kB worth of text
that not everybody is interested in reading. 
Hmm?
