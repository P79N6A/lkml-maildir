Thank you.  Piotr, you might have considered asking the person who

First, I'm not so sure it's a good idea to depend on the ide-cd driver.  
The entire IDE infrastructure is currently being changed.
Second, if you're designing an ATAPI pass-through driver, why restrict
yourself to CD devices?  Why not do a general ATAPI or even SCSI
pass-through?
Third, you shouldn't do this by adding SCSI/ATAPI capability to 
g_file_storage.  Instead you should write a completely new driver, 
since its operation will be quite different.  (I thought of doing this 
myself some time ago, but never felt the need.)  You could call it 
g_scsi_storage, for "SCSI-backed Storage driver".

Correct except for the word "emulate": This would be a real Unit 
Attention condition.  Your driver would then have to return the sense 
data in response to the next REQUEST SENSE command from the host.

No.  You have to expect and allow for autosensing.

The SCSI-generic driver has a pass-through mechanism.  It is intended 
to be called from userspace, but you probably could use it from another 
driver too.  However you would still face the same problem.

Here's some more critical feedback: What you want to do is essentially
impossible, because it would require your driver to have unbounded
memory buffer space.  The host can transfer as much data as it likes
(up to 4 GB) and your driver would need to buffer all that data before
initiating the underlying ATAPI/SCSI command.
Unless you know of some mechanism I'm not aware of, whereby ide-cd or 
some other driver will allow you to provide the transfer data in pieces 
over a long period of time?
