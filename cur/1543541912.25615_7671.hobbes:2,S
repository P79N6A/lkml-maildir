I disagree since there are always future features that can be planned.  
They can either start planning for 2.7 or move of the list.
The argument in question though is not likely to be ready for 2.5 at this
rate.. they seem to be repeating the same points over and over.  Someone
should actually try an implementation instead of just arguing.
Usually I read all posts but that is one of the few threads I've started
to just delete without reading.. I echo the pleas of the others to take
it off list.
