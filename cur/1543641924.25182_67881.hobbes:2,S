I have not looked at Robert's recycle skb patch yet. I couldn't
find it in the link he sent me so I don't know how it works. However
I thought about it a little more and realized that even when you
recycle the skbs, they need to be initialized (cleaned up). I don't
understand how
can the recycle skb patch avoid calling constructors and destructors for
the
skb.  The skbs are given back to the driver instead of freeing to the skb
hot list
or to the slab. That does not eliminate the part of the code of kfree_skb
which
releases dst, initializes part of skb and executes destructor.
Tell me if I am wrong but wouldn't it break the code. So I do think that
recycle skb patch will not mitigate the benefits of the skb init
patch.
