Hi everyone,
3com has updated their linux NIC driver to fix some SMP issues:
ftp://ftp.3com.com/pub/nic/linux/3c90x-1.0.0i.tar.gz
Presently, the driver is written for linux 2.2.
What were the other issues (apart from non-2.4 support)?
If I could get some feedback on them, then I'll forward it to Terry Murphy
(developer support) at 3com.
- Dan
