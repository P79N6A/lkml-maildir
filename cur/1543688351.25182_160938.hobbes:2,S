No. Not possible. fsync() doesn't really make a difference here. Just that 
the first "12" gets its way into the disk. Th read will still read both 
"12"s from the cache (in very high possibility). Even if the page caches 
are stolen (due to mem shortage) the kernel file cachecing will ensure 
that you get consistent data.
