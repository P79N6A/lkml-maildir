I don't understand this.  The alsa-lib doesn't skip the h/w access.
It still accesses the device file as usual, open/close/ioctls.  If the
h/w to do softmix is restricted, you can't use it, too.
Or, am I missing something else?

Because many people believe that the softmix in the kernel space is
evil.  The discussion aboult this could be a long thread.

The problem is not the interface but the implementation.

Please define "usual cases".

Because OSS API doesn't cover many things.  For example, 
- PCM with non-interleaved formats
- PCM with 3-bytes-packed 24bit formats
These functions are popluar on many sound devices.
In addition, imagine how you would implement the following:
- Combination of multiple devices
- Split of channels to concurrent accesses
- Handling of floating pointer samples
- Post/pre-effects (like chorus/reverb)
Forcing OSS API means to force to process the all things above in
the kernel.  I guess many people would disagree with it.
