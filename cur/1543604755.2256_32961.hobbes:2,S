I use the 'fast/slow' model for app server development.  The fastest
machine is used to build kernels for the slower test machine(s)
regardless of architecture or latest/greatest hardware.  Most results
can be scaled once you understand interactions.  NFS w no_root_squash is
useful provided a secure LAN.
