I had a somewhat similar idea, once i have time to implement it ill
submit a patch.
My idea consisted of adding the capability to specify a device for
tmpfs mounting. if you dont specify any device, tmpfs continues to
behave the way it currently is. But if you do, once data doesnt fit on
ram (or some other limit) anymore, it will flush things to this
device. my intention was to reuse swap code for this, so you mount a
tmpfs passing the dev node of some unused swap device, and it works
just like tmpfs with a dedicated swap partition.
So i hope it would be damn fast because of the simple disk format, and
ofcourse all the data becomes lost if you umount it.
