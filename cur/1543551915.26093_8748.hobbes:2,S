I take it then that you never use a hard drive in any of your systems on
the grounds that it contains non-open source firmware which may affect
the security of your system? ;)  Tell me, what do you use to store all
those Linux applications on?
Hmm, I wonder if you drive a car, travel by train or by plane...?  Do you
trust the firmware involved there?
