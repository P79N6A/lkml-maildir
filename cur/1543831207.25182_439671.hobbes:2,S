The Ubuntu initramfs doesn't use kinit, and it would be nice if we
weren't forced to.  We do a number of things in our initramfs (like a
userspace bootsplace) which we need done before most of the things kinit
wants to do take place.
kinit is a nice default tool but longer term, I almost imagine it as a
busybox type of setup.  Either you say "go" and it brings up the system,
or you call it with an argument, change argv[0] or something to get just
the functionality asked for.
