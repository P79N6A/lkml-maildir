Subject: [offtopic] Solaris7 on Intel vs Linux 2.2.X on Intel?

Sorry  if this is too off topic...we want the price/performance
of Intel boxes for one particualr situation. Our client thinks
Solaris 7 on Intel would be far better than Linux...I've no
experience with v7 (previous Intel Solarises were not
happy things), some say v7 is different...is it?
How does it stack up to Linux 2.2.X?
Thanks.
Russ
