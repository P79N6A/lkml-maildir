My point was, I load dummyphp with showunused=0 and only get dirs for the
slots with devices in them. Now I decide to put a network card (or whatever
I have to spare) in an empty slot, hope that the system doesn't reboot
immediately, and voila I don't have any /sys/bus/pci/slots dir to enable
the slot and have to reboot nevertheless. Or does the pci system a rescan
if I reinsert the module?
Thanks,
Jan
