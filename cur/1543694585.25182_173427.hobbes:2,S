Well the big win I found from -Os is the disabling of code inlining.
So I found I got much better code from -finline-limit=100. I
found this value after trial and error (via a bit of bench marking).
Mind you this is what works for my athlon.. Mind you the
difference isnt that huge.. I found turning on -Winline and
-finline-limit handy for finding the culprits of huge inlines..
