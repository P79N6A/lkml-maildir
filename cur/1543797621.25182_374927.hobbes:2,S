Ah yes. But wait... I've got an important question here.
For instance, let's take your MTD driver. You're allocating a message 
structure on stack and passing it then down to spi->master->transfer 
function.
The benefit you're talking about is that you don't have to use 
heavyweight memory allocation. But... the transfer is basically async so 
spi->master->transfer will need to copy your message structure to its 
own-allocated structure so some memory copying will occur as this might 
be an async transfer (and therefore the stack-allocated message may be 
freed at some point when it's yet used!)
So your model implies concealed double message allocation/copying, 
doesn't it?
And if I'm wrong, can you please explain me this?
