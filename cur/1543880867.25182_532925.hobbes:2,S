-1142MB HIGHMEM available.
+118MB HIGHMEM available.
So you have more RAM than I do :)
-NX (Execute Disable) protection: active
You enabled PAE, I didn't..
(Though I have tried both, makes no difference)
 DMI present.
+Using APIC driver default
Hmm.
 ACPI: RSDP 000F67B0, 0024 (r2 LENOVO)

+ACPI: FACP 3F6D1400, 00F4 (r3 LENOVO TP-7J        1050 LNVO        1)
BIOS differences (lots of these)
-Allocating PCI resources starting at 88000000 (gap: 80000000:70000000)
+Allocating PCI resources starting at 50000000 (gap: 40000000:b0000000)
Probably due to the RAM differences shuffling the memmap.
-Kernel command line: ro root=LABEL=/ acpi_sleep=s3_bios combined_mode=libata
+Kernel command line: ro root=/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 profile=1
Hmm. I tried..
acpi_sleep=s3_bios
acpi_sleep=s3_mode
acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode
all did nothing for me.
-CPU: After all inits, caps: bfe9fbff 00100000 00000000 00002940 0000c1a9 00000000 00000000

Probably PAE
-CPU0: Intel Genuine Intel(R) CPU           T2400  @ 1.83GHz stepping 08
+CPU0: Intel(R) Core(TM) Duo CPU      L2400  @ 1.66GHz stepping 0c
slightly different CPU, but probably not enough to make any difference.

- =======================
heh, one for Ingo :)
-ACPI: ACPI Dock Station Driver 
-ACPI: \_SB_.PCI0.IDE0.PRIM.MSTR: found ejectable bay
-ACPI: \_SB_.PCI0.IDE0.PRIM.MSTR: Adding notify handler
-ACPI: Bay [\_SB_.PCI0.IDE0.PRIM.MSTR] Added
Hmm, I should try without the dock stuff built.
-PCI: Using MMCONFIG
+PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xfd82b, last bus=24
+PCI: Using configuration type 1
Think I've tried with and without MMCONFIG
-pnp: PnP ACPI: found 11 devices
+pnp: PnP ACPI: found 13 devices
My Wacom tablet is one of them. There's also a mysterious 13th device :)
 ibm_acpi: IBM ThinkPad ACPI Extras v0.13
 ibm_acpi: 
http://ibm-acpi.sf.net/
-ibm_acpi: ThinkPad EC firmware 7BHT37WW-1.10
+ibm_acpi: ThinkPad EC firmware 7JHT12WW-1.03
possibly just because of the touchscreen.
So most of the differences seem to be BIOS/firmware rather than hardware. 
The PCI bus layout is identical for eg.
Looking at your .config, I notice that you don't have CONFIG_FB_BACKLIGHT set
(because you don't have any framebuffer drivers that use it enabled).
Can you enable say.. CONFIG_FB_RADEON=m and CONFIG_FB_RADEON_BACKLIGHT=y
(which should turn on CONFIG_FB_BACKLIGHT=y by dependancy), and see if
it stops working for you? (You don't even need to load radeonfb.ko, just
have it compiled).
