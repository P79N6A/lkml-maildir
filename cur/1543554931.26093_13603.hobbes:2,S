Right now, I suspect that the in-kernel pcmcia code is actually at the
point where it _is_ possible to use it. David Hinds has been keeping the
cs layer in synch with the external versions, and tons of people have
helped make the low-level drivers stable again.
If somebody still has a problem with the in-kernel stuff, speak up.
