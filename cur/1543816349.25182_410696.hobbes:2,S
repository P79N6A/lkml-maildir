Is this true?  There's no rounding that I can see.  An attempt is made 
to adjust the timestamp for the drift between time as seen from the two 
CPUs but there's no deliberate rounding involved.  Of course, that's not 
to say that the adjustment is accurate as I'm not convinced that the 
difference between the run queues' timestamp_last_tick is a always 
totally accurate measure of the drift in their clocks (due to possible 
races -- I may be wrong).
Of course, that doesn't mean that this chunk of code isn't required just 
that the comment is misleading.

I think that this will end up with p->timestamp being set with a time 
appropriate to the current task's CPU rather than its own.
