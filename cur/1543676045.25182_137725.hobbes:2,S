Subject: IOAPIC not disabled on shutdown of X86_UP_IOAPIC kernel 2.4.18

The following patch causes the IOAPIC to be disabled during shutdown of
kernels compiled with either the CONFIG_SMP or the CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC
options (either of which causes the IOAPIC to be initialized).
Previously, the IOAPIC was disabled only during shutdown of CONFIG_SMP
kernels, and not CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC kernels.  This caused unexpected
IRQ errors on warm boot of CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC kernel because BIOS did
not reset the IOAPIC.
