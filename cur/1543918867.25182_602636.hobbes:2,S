It can race with sched_setaffinity().  It has to give up tasklist_lock as 
well to call set_cpus_allowed() and can race
	cpus_allowed = cpuset_cpus_allowed(p);
	cpus_and(new_mask, new_mask, cpus_allowed);
	retval = set_cpus_allowed(p, new_mask);
and allow a task to have a cpu outside of the cpuset's new cpus_allowed if 
you've taken it away between cpuset_cpus_allowed() and set_cpus_allowed().
