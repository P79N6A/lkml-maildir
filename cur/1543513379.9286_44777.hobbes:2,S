I tried SAMSUNG SC-148B (48x) yesterday and it DOES work.
My old GCD-R540C does only pio 3, while the samsung does pio 4  and dma mword2
(see below),  maybe this could be the problem ?
Can I tune something in drivers/block/ide-* to make it work ?
Well except that pio 3 thing the GCD-R540C is an excellent drive, it reads DA
frames, has FFWD/REV, PLAY buttons, honours SETSPEED ioctl and is absolutely
quiet. Tha Samsung sounds like helicopter and can't be even slowed down via
ioctl :-(  It does't do 48x either (maybe internally), hdparm -t says 3MB/s.  
Anybody knows a good drive ?
thanks,
Frantisek Dufka
