Did you build the proper 'struct iovec' ?  It gets a pointer to
your "hello", not the string itself as member iov_base.
If you look at this with the debugger, you need to dereference
this pointer. The string can be anywhere.
When receiving, that struct member gets a pointer to your buffer,
not the buffer itself. This means that struct iovec is always
the sizeof(void *) + sizeof(size_t) in length.
