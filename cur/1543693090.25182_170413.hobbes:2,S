It's my understanding that bootsect.S:kill_motor is part of
the kernel's old builtin boot-from-floppy code, and that it
doesn't run when some other boot loader loaded the kernel.
(And it shouldn't have to.)
The workaround if you have a buggy BIOS or external loader
is to configure BLK_DEV_FD as a built-in. I do that anyway
for other reasons (to avoid an unresolved module autoloading
failure in some cases; it's in RH bugzilla somewhere).
