Hello,
I'm using an equinox sst serial board with one of our linux
systems here.  There is a beta version of the driver that
can be obtained from ftp.equinox.com/library/sst/linux335.tgz.
The driver works but i imagine there is plenty of room for
improvement.  Will this driver ever become a part of the
linux kernel?  I also have a USB HP CD-Writer 8200, is there
an experimental driver for this out there somewhere?
Thanks in advance!
Ralf
