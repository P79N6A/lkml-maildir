To all--
As ECN deployment increases, people are increasingly noticing that some
key web sites are still inaccessible when ECN is enabled.
A Web site has been created to assist with this transition, with two key
features:  (1) ECN-related fixes are posted on this Web page, and (2)
vendors whose products are broken are posted on this Web page.
The address is		
http://gtf.org/garzik/ecn/
If you have comments, fixes or updates for this Web page, especially new
links to vendor fixes or acknowledged vendor bugs, please e-mail them to
ecn@gtf.org.
