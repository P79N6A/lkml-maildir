Actually there is already such a test in init/main.c like this - just
update the numbers.  I put it there quite a few years back when gcc-2.5.8
was finally declared too dain-bramaged to use. 
[init/main.c gets hit early on - you didn't want to spend hours on an i386sx
generating garbage object files only to be told near the end of doing it...]
