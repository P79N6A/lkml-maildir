Yes, this does the trick for me. With this fix it survived the last 30m 
of torture (consisting of make -j4 bzImage, a gcc build plus 2 mozillas 
and 1 OpenOffice.org word processor, bear in mind it is only a P200 box) 
blissfully -- previously it took only 15 seconds with a 1/3 that load to 
lock up. So, this patch definitely cures it.
