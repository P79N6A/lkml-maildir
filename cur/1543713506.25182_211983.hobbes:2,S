I don't think you understand how udev works.  Who are you thinking does
the mknod of the device files?  udev does it only if it sees a file
called "dev" in sysfs for a device.  Your wrapper does not do this at
all (it could be changed to use class_simple to get it, if you so
desired.)

pci_register_driver() as Documentation/pci.txt says to use.  Works just
wonderful from 2.4 to 2.6, and I think it's even been backported to work
on 2.2 if you so desire.

Well, feel free to submit portions of it as patches that clean up the
current API, if you think it will help out any.  In my short glance, I
didn't really see anything that would help out all that much, but I'm
probably missing something.
