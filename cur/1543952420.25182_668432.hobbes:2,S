Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Xilinx: hwicap: Verify sync before reading idcode.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

It appears that in some cases, the sync word might not be recognized
by the hardware correctly.  If this happens, then attempting to read
from the port results in an unrecoverable error because of the design
of the FPGA core.  This patch updates the code to check the status of
the device before reading the IDCODE, in order to avoid entering this
unrecoverable state.  This patch also adds additional NOOP commands
into the sychronization sequence, which appears to be necessary to
avoid the condition on some hardware.
