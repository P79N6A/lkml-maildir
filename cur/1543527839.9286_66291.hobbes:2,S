Subject: total swap bigger then 4GB

The kernel stores total swap in an unsigned long variable (in the struct
sysinfo in kernel.h). If we have a total swap of more the 4GB, the value
overflows, and, for example, info displayed in /proc/meminfo is wrong
(actually it is the 32 least significant bits of the value).
Is there any way to overcome this problem?
