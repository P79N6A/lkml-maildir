I don't believe it does; it certainly shouldn't change the usermode 
ABI.  How do you see it changing?

That's OK.  The current task will still be available in thread_info; 
this is needed for very early CPU bringup anyway, before the PDA has 
been set up.  The vast majority of "get current task" operations can be 
swept up by changing "current" however.

To be honest, I haven't looked at percpu.h in great detail.  I was 
making assumptions about how it works, but it looks like they were wrong.
