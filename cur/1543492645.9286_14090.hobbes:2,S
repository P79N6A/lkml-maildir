I've been having a problem with CD-Reading under Linux 2.2.x (currently
2.2.3) and was wondering whether anyone could help. I believe it is
kernel-related, as there problems vanish when I use 2.0.36-0.7. However,
2.2.x gives some major performance advantages which I'd hate to lose.
I've asked around and everyone seems to be stumped as to a solution.
I use RedHat 5.2, with the kernel-2.2 upgrades plus the mount-2.9i RPM
from contrib net (I upgraded from the default just in case that was the
problem). I have both a CD-Writer (HP 8100i) and CD-Reader (something
generic) running under SCSI emulation (append = "hdb=ide-scsi
hdd=ide-scsi" in lilo boot). None of the relevant kernel components are
modular.
When I mount either hdb (HP 8100i CD-Rom Writer) or hdd (generic IDE
CD-Rom) certain iso9660 (I don't use any others) CD's exhibit missing
directories. Those that are present are the earliest ones,
alphanumerically speaking. This is consistent between the two drives,
and applies equally when I do not append the ide-scsi options. I've
tried disabling SCSI emulation and running IDE only (effectively
disabling CD-Writing) but with no success.
If anyone can help, or advise, I would be grateful. At the moment,
everyone I ask seems to be stumped.
Regards,
-Karl
