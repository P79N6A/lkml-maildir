I've had no luck at all with noflushd on my Toshiba Satellite 4070CDT.
It would spin down every few minutes, and then spin up _immediately_,
every time.  I have no idea why.
This was noflushd-2.5-1 (the RPM packaged by Daniel Kobras), on some 2.4
kernel (I don't remember which).  I gave up trying it some months ago.
