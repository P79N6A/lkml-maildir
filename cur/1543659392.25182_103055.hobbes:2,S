Hmmh, you mean that the boot loader can just load the vmlinux sections to 
the LMAs, right? Yes, I can see that this makes sense - Most archs don't 
actually load the ELF file, so they don't even have the LMA information,
but for them it shouldn't hurt, either.
So it should be possible to have the correct LMA for all archs w/o
breakage. Might be worth a try.
