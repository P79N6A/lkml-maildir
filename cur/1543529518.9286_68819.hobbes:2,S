Agreed, though inheriting the DEATHSIG from the parent at clone time is
another adequate solution.
This should go in the man page for prctl or <linux/prctl.h> (which
serves as documentation for pcrtl unfortunately): "For some applications
PR_SET_PDEATHSIG may be called too late.  Use the following method to
avoid a race condition when the parent has died already."  Followed by
your code.
