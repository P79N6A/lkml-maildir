Hi
My box is: Cyrix 486, 12Meg RAM, CS4239 ISA sound
card,
no pci controler
I tested your patch both with kernel 2.4.14 +
 preemptible patches + ide patches , and with
kernel 2.4.16 clean.
The patch applied cleanly on both kernels.
The play command is working like it was working 
without this patch.
But when I was running mtv (
http://www.mpegtv.com
) 
the only thing I can hear is noise.
Whithout your patch mtv is playing the sound with
interrupts.
I didn't done extended testing because i don't have
 sound files on my computer (just movies) but if you
 want something specific tested please let me know 
and i'll try to help
Bye
