pci_unmap_single is the exact opposite of pci_map_single. It unmaps a
memory region. It just doesn't do what you want.
Bottom line, to keep your driver portable, you are going to have to keep
a mapping of the dma and real addresses either in a structure as most
drivers do, or as a hash like a couple difficult ones do.
