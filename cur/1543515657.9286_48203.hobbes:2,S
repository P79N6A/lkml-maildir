You don't mean this seriously.
vfork is a system call today.
It has te be documented.

Ah, and there was nothing, and I wrote a page.
(In fact, as it turns out, another page was sitting in my inbox,
but that is irrelevant in the present discussion.)
Now do you find anything wrong in my page?
Your corrections are very welcome.

[P.S. My previous announcement had the good effect that several people
submitted some last minute corrections to man-pages-1.26. So it was
not yesterday night. Probably you'll have man-pages-1.27 tonight.]
