Actually, I'm interested in this as well. The only thing stopping me from
buying a dual Athlon MP is the problems I keep reading about here on lkml.
I don't want to spend the money only to have problems.
So, if anyone is running dual Athlon MPs *flawlessly*, I'd appreciate a
hardware listing (MB, Bios version, RAM type & manufacturer, etc.).
Thanks,
/Mike
