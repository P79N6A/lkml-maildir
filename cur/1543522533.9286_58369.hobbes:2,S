I'm on RedHat 6.0.  I'm inclined to agree that the problem is likely SuSe.
I recall a discussion a month or so back wrt links in the distribution
getting tangled up with active kernel sources.  You might want to find(1)
links pointing into your distribution source tree (/usr/src/linux on
RedHat), and see if you find a problem.

I use Slackware 7.0 with the same board & cpu.
Up to 2.3.40pre1 i´ve got no problem.
Seems to be a SuSE problem.
