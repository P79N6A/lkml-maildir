We are taking a very different approach to EAs (and thus to ACLs) as 
described in brief at www.namesys.com/v4/v4.html.  We don't expect 
anyone to take us seriously on it before it works, but silence while 
coding does not equal consensus.;-)
In essence, we think that if a file can't do what an EA can do, then you 
need to make files able to do more.
It is very important not to reduce the amount of closure (as in 
mathematical closure) within the namespace, and creating EAs that cannot 
be accessed as files reduces closure.
The same argument applies to streams, but it is kind of interesting to 
see people argue against streams for this reason, and then embrace EAs. 
 Kind of leaves you wondering whether their hatred of streams was really 
any deeper than streams aren't what they are used to from Unix.
