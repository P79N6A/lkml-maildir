Hi,
Sorry for replying late.
I understand that I had a woring assumption and I need to change my
patch. I'll post the fixed one as soon as possible.
As Rajesh pointed out, there are many drivers which initialize the
device with the wrong order. They should be fixed. I would like to
confirm the correct order to initialize the device again. Is the
following correct order?
    (1) pci_request_regions()
    (2) pci_enable_device()
    (3) request_irq()
    (4) free_irq()
    (5) pci_disable_device()
    (6) pci_release_regions()
Thanks,
Kenji Kaneshige
