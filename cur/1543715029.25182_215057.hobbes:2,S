That it is, but if you use the mrouted source and patches from the 
Debian distribution it's fairly easy to get a basic network working. It 
took me a few days to get it all set up, but I now have a router that 
routes multicast between local devices and two remotes over OpenVPN 
tunnels. Setting up mrouted was actually pretty easy, once I figured out 
that's what I needed and got the Debian patches so it would compile.
