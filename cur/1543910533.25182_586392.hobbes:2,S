Even the good ones pretty much never start out perfect[1]. It always
takes some criticism and fixing before the code is right, let alone
the design.
(Of course part of the problem with this idea is that it was so vague
that the only problems there *could* be with it were huge gaping ones:
you can't have subtle problems with an idea with no subtle elements.
Unfortunately it had a lot of those, and fixing them without junking
the whole idea would be hard. No, I haven't thought about how to do
it: Marc might like to, though, what with it being his idea and all.)
[1] except mingo's. mingo has the Perfect Design Mojo. How this came
    to pass, mere mortals may not speculate.
