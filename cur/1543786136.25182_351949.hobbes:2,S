Yes it does. The semantics are clearly "I want enough memory to hold
the type this pointer points to." While sizeof(struct foo) might seem
more readable, it is in fact not as you have no way of knowing whether
the allocation is correct or not by looking at the line. So for
spotting allocation errors with grep, the shorter form is better (and
arguably less error-prone).
