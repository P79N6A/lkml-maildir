I suspect that the lock_cpu_hotplug is no longer necessary in
sched_setaffinity.  I found the original changeset which introduced
it, and it's short enough that I'll just duplicate it here:

#   [PATCH] Hotplug CPUs: Take cpu Lock Around Migration
#   
#   Grab cpu lock around sched_migrate_task() and
#sys_sched_setaffinity().
#   This is a noop without CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU.
#   
#   The sched_migrate_task may have a performance penalty on NUMA if
#lots
#   of exec rebalancing is happening, however this only applies to
#   CONFIG_NUMA and CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, which noone does at the moment
#   anyway.
#   
#   Also, the scheduler in -mm solves the race another way, so this
#will
#   vanish then.

#   Hotplug CPUs: Take cpu Lock Around Migration
# 
The lock/unlock_cpu_hotplug is no longer there in sched_migrate_task.
The changelog leads me to believe that it was intended that the same
change should have been made to sched_setaffinity by now.  I think
it's safe to remove it; I can't see why it would be necessary any
more.
