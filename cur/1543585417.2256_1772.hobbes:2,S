It appears that this problem is easier to create than we originally gave
credit for....  All that is needed is for gettimeoffset() not to be
called for a _minimum_ of >10ms, and for the timer to wrap during a call
to do_gettimeofday() or during a period of time where interrupts are
disabled and do_gettimeofday() is called.  Note that there is no upper
limit to the time...
If we call gettimeoffset() after do_timer() returns (and there-by update
the internal variables every 10ms), we should reduce the impact of this
bug dramatically (in theory--in practice, disabling interrupts for long
periods can also have some bad effects that this won't help, but I think
that's another issue.)
One of the guys I'm working with did some testing on this, and he was
seeing this problem (off by 10ms) every 5 to 10 minutes (on a modified
ARM & kernel).  With the additional gettimeoffset() call, he no longer
saw it (at least within ~3hrs.).
Questions, comments, etc.?
