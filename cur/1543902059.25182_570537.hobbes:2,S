I'm afraid of one thing, though.
If we create a framework without ACPI (well, ACPI needs to be enabled in the
kernel anyway for other reasons, like the ability to suspend to RAM) and then
it turns out that we have to add some ACPI hooks to it, that might be difficult
to do cleanly.
Thus, it seems reasonable to think of the ACPI handling in advance.
