This part of the thread is really veering off-topic. This counters thing is
your own personal crusade and has nothing to do with the fundamental need
for a generic buffering mechanism such as relayfs.
I would suggest you start a separate thread to discuss the implementation of
a generic counters mechanism, if that's indeed what you're interested in.
