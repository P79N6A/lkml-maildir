Since this is being stored on-disk, you may want to consider
endianness issues.  I guess for binaries this isn't really a
problem (since they're unlikely to be run on other platforms),
though perhaps it is for shell scripts and the like.  Storing
values in native endianness poses problems for backup/restore
programs, NFS, etc.
IIRC, the other LSM security attribute values are stored as
ASCII strings on-disk to avoid this sort of issue.
cheers.
