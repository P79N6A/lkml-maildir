however, in most cases the difference between the native machine and the 
thing you are testing for is a factor >20, so a fuzz factor of 2 still 
gets you pretty close.

if you need this level of detail you need the actual hardware or a 
hardware emulator. however there's a lot of 'is the performance 
reasonable' type testing that needs to be done (and useually needs to be 
done repeatedly, either with different performance settings or with 
after fixing performance issues) before you have to go to this step.
