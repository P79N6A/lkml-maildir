Things like checkpatch could help advise people to bump the version
number, but it's a bit iffy. Matt D. actually uses the special source
version modinfo for DKMS - which is different - but it makes me wonder
whether dynamically generating a version based on source SHA1 wouldn't
be a better idea in most cases than an outdated hard-coded one.
Comments?
