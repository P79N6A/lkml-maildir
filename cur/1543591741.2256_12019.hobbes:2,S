No, the problem is not with which section, but what flags that
section should have.  If you put only "const" data in a section,
then the section should have SHF_WRITE clear.  Conversely, if
you put writable data in a section then SHF_WRITE should be set.
Now, one could argue that gcc should scan the entire file to
see if there are any non-constant data members added to a 
particular section, and set SHF_WRITE if any such exist.
My answer is: you would not like gcc's memory usage under these
conditions.
