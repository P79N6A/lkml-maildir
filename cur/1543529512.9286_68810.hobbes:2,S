Hi,
My machine couldn't compile linux with parallel port support.
Obviously there is an undefined reference to parport_pc_init_pci.
include/asm-i386/parport.h (line 16) declares:
  static int parport_pc_init_pci(int irq, int dma);
However parport_pc_init_pci was removed from
drivers/parport/parport_pc.c with the patch-2.3.51.
The only call to parport_pc_init_pci that i found is in parport.h line
45 in the function parport_pc_init.
This is my first Kernel-bug-report.. i am sorry for any inconvenience.
(Corrections welcome)
yours
Leonard
