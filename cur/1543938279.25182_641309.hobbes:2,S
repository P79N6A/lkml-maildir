did your "usual tweaks" include mounting with -o tcp,rsize=262144,wsize=262144 ?
i should have kept better notes last time i was experimenting with this,
but from memory here's what i found:
- if i used three NFS clients and was reading from page cache on the
  server i hit 1.2GB/s total throughput from the server.  the client
  NFS code was maxing out one CPU on each of the client machines.
- disk subsystem (sw raid10 far2) was capable of 600MB/s+ when read
  locally on the NFS server, but topped out around ~250MB/s when read
  remotely (no matter how many clients).
my workload was read-intensive so i didn't experiment with writes...
