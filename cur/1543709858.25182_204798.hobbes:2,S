exactly.

because in most high end workloads several gigabytes of ram are
allocated in the pagetables, and without this patch we would waste
another several gigabytes for rmap too (basically doubling the memory
cost of the pagetables). And several gigabytes of ram saved is "tons of
ram" in my vocabulary. I'm talking 64bit here (ignoring the fact the
several gigabytes doesn't fit anyways in the max 4G of zone-normal with
4:4)

it does, the number precisely is a 30% figure slowdown in kernel compiles.
also check any readprofile in any of your boxes, rmap is at the very
top.

highmem has nothing to do with this. Saving several gigs of ram and
speedups of 30% on 32-ways are the only real reason.
