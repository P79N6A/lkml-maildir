Totally and utterly immaterial.
If it's a timing-related bug, as far as developers are concerned, nothing 
they did introduced the problem.
So anybody who think s that "process" should have caught it is just being 
stupid. 
Adrian, you're one of the absolutely *worst* in the camp of "everything 
should be perfect". You really need to realize that reality is messy, and 
things cannot be pefect.
You also need to realize and *understand* that aiming for "good" is 
actually much BETTER than trying to aim for "perfect".
Perfect is the enemy of good.
