Hi,
I've been trying to get 2.6.0 to work, I've enabled modules support, but 
I get this error on my logs:
Jul 15 15:38:36 Darakemba kernel: No module symbols loaded - kernel 
modules not enabled.
Is there any thing like a new modutils that should be used with 2.6.x 
family?
The kernel does boot, but not having any modules I can't do much, and 
also, I never get to really see the messages on screen, on logs I have 
this line:
Jul 15 15:38:36 Darakemba kernel: Video mode to be used for restore is ffff
What does it mean?
I disabled all the framebuffer things so I can just use vga, on lilo, 
vga mode is set to normal, but still can't see anything.
TIA,
