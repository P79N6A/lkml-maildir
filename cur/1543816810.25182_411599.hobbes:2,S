I have some doubt about this. The Thinkpad R52 is already supported
(with identifier string "ThinkPad R52", unsuprisingly) and "ThinkPad H"
doesn't exactly sound sane. Looks like your DMI data is corrupted or
something. Could you please provide the output of dmidecode and
vpddecode on your laptop?
Anyone else with a Thinkpad R52 can provide the same information for
comparison?
Feel free to send the outputs to me privately if you don't want to make
them public.
Thanks,
