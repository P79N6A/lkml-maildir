We get in to way too many levels of underscores here. Please changes
this to be blk_end_request() and blk_end_request_locked(), where the
former grabs the queue lock but the latter assumes it's held. Then have
the static __blk_end_request() where the lock MUST be held - do this in
the caller, don't pass it as an argument!
