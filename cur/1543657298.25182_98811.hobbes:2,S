Uuumph. Thanks for reminding me. That made me update the page and the
Changelog in a hurry.
It does work for latest 2.4. I ported to 2.4.19 a couple of months ago.
Nowadays it uses string common prefix compression to reduce the
internal size. Probably 4-12K in total (there are a LOT of kernel
compilation params nowadays), but the output from /proc/config
is exactly as it should be.
   Module                  Size  Used by    Not tainted
   config                 10908   0 (unused)
   betty:/usr/oboe/ptb/lib/www/proconfig% cat /proc/config | wc
       855     855   18421
(855 kernel config options, with 18.4K of output chars)
   betty:/usr/oboe/ptb/lib/www/proconfig% head /proc/config
   CONFIG_X86=y
   CONFIG_ISA=y
   CONFIG_UID16=y
   CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL=y
   CONFIG_MODULES=y
   ...
Now I suppose I need to port it to latest 2.5. Assuming I can compile a
2.5, that is! I haven't tried since 2.5.47, which was before that
modules change.
