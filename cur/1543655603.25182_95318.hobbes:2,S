Probably not true, since MS doesn't like the GPL.  However, MS may 
release *nix applications any time they want to.  Way back in 
prehistory, they did supply unix applications and currently Apple uses a 
kind of BSD, so to release a Linux version of MS Office and other 
utilities, would be very easy for them as they just need to recompile 
the Apple versions.
