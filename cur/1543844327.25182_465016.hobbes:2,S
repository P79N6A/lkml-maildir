Ah, I'm reading threads with interest.
I think this discussion is about using fake nodes ('struct pgdat')
to divide system's memory into some chunks. Your thought is that
for resizing/adding/removing fake pgdat, memory-hot-plug codes may be useful. 
correct ?
Now, memory-hotplug manages all memory by 'section' and allows adding/(removing)
section to pgdat.
Does this section-size handling meet container people's requirement ?
And do we need freeing page when pgdat is removed ?
I think at least SPARSEMEM is useful for fake nodes because 'struct page'
are not tied to pgdat. (DISCONTIGMEM uses node_start_pfn. SPARSEMEM not.)
