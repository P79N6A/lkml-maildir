One would hope. ;)
But the problem is that most people will not be able to find this
option (or even know such an option exists). I'd guess the distros will
just end up having this on by default anyway. And since I could not
measure any extra power drain, I believe it's hard to justify having it
off by default (more than by pure principle).
(Then there's also the whole "But Windows doesn't have this problem!"
line of reasoning...)
