First 6 lines of Kernel Makefile (SuSE 8 ES on AMD64 Opteron):
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 4
SUBLEVEL = 21
EXTRAVERSION = -$(CONFIG_RELEASE)-$(CONFIG_CFGNAME)
KERNELRELEASE=$(VERSION).$(PATCHLEVEL).$(SUBLEVEL)$(EXTRAVERSION)
Last 7 lines of .config (SuSE 8 ES on AMD64 Opteron):
#
# Build options
#
# CONFIG_SUSE_KERNEL is not set
CONFIG_UNITEDLINUX_KERNEL=y
CONFIG_CFGNAME="smp"
CONFIG_RELEASE=207
Those " characters around "smp" will not go away automatically.
To see the difference try these lines in Makefile:
    echo $(KERNELRELEASE)
    echo '$(KERNELRELEASE)'
Those " characters make quite difference in Makefile code like this:
ifneq ($(KERNELRELEASE),$(shell uname -r))
    @echo You compiled this for wrong kernel
endif
You seem to use SUSE email address, so maybe _you_ should be answering this
question: What kind of crap 've you been smokin'?
