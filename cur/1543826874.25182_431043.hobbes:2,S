Yes, it's possible, but will add overhead to the common  IRQ path just
to handle an early boot special case.

I'm taking a broader point of view here. More than just interrupt init,
it's in general having basic kernel services such as memory allocator,
which shouldn't need any special hardware initialization outside of the
mmu, be setup before we start banging hardware.

No. THere is, imho, a very clear difference between services that do
rely on hw devices, ioremap, and such major infrastructure as page
tables, and services like slab which essentially, can be initialized
with the CPU itself being ready and nothing else.
