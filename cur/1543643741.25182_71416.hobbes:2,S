If I use the same tape and the same environment (OS 2.4.3.12 and CPU
ALPHA EV6) i have observed:
    the system crash happens during rewind the tape; in fact if I
substitute /dev/st0
    with /dev/nst0 and so i don't active the "close" system call in
rewind mode, 3 times on 3
    tar file is restored.
    Now I want see what happens in controller's (QLOGIC ISP1020) driver
during the close.
    Someone has any ideas?
    Thank you
