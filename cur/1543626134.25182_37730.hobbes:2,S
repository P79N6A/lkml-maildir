I sorry i didnt know who exactly to send this too. And i dont exactly know if this is is something on my conputer or a bug with in the kernel. But i have never recived this error before untill i used kernel version 2.4.18. And honestly speeking, i wouldnt know where to begin to fix the problem. I attached my dmesg output and kernel config  to this email and i hope it helps out, if you need something else please let me know. 
Thanks in advance for the help!
