Not to the best of my knowledge, although you should probably read the
code to convince yourself.

This isn't what the bug caused.  What could happen was that the
swapper could unmap a page from a process's virtual memory map before
it noticed that the page had an elevated reference count.  The page
wouldn't get swapped out, but when the process caused a page fault to
bring the virtual address back, it would get a different piece of
physical memory.
