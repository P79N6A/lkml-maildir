Subject: Current utrace breaks UML

This chunk from linux-2.6-utrace.patch breaks PTRACE_SYSEMU, which UML
rather relies on.
@@ -514,9 +514,6 @@ syscall_trace_entry:
 	movl %esp, %eax
 	xorl %edx,%edx
 	call do_syscall_trace
-	cmpl $0, %eax
-	jne resume_userspace		# ret != 0 -> running under PTRACE_SYSEMU,
-					# so must skip actual syscall
 	movl PT_ORIG_EAX(%esp), %eax
 	cmpl $(nr_syscalls), %eax
 	jnae syscall_call
If the point of this patch was to completely remove ptrace support,
with later patches adding it back, then that chunk should be added
back in utrace-ptrace-compat.patch.
