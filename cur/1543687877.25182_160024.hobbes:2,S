Exactly - code to accomodate any PS/2 keyboard that doesn't do
untranslated set 3 is a workaround, in my opinion.  People with
perfect keyboards should be able to benefit from the simplicity they
allow.  Obviously 'set 2 + workarounds' needs to be the default,
because of the hardware in existance, but there is still an advantage
to using set 3 where possible.
