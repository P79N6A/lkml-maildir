I like it and think it might do it.  Just for the record, we are tinkering
with the following patch.  The thinking is that logical CPUs in HT and
multi-core domain are usually on the same CPU package, and it is likely that
the tsc are synchronized, so we can take current time stamp and use it
directly to compare with p->last_ran.  I'm planning on running a couple of
experiments with both patches.
