           Summary: pnp_allow_dma0 option
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0-test4
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: ambx1@neo.rr.com

It looks like this option has been moved from isapnp to resource.c, but the
MODULE_PARM line is still there:

Moreover, the new option "allowdma0" in resource.c only allows to set
pnp_allow_dma0 to 1 but not to 0. My original intention was that the
default value is -1 such that:
-1 => the user did not request a specific value and a quirk can set it to 
     1 if some hardware needs this.
0  => the user requested not to use it, and a quirk should not change this
