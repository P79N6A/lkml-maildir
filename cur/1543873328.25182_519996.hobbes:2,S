Well, this means that your patch series doesn't actually *compile* as a 
series.
In other words, it's a pointless series, since the individual patches just 
generate a non-working kernel, until they have all been applied. 
So I really meant that each patch should be generated with "git diff -M", 
and you'd have a series of patches that are all working and move one part 
of the tree at a time (with Makefile changes etc integrated).
Also, in case you didn't notice, it's also perfectly fine to have  
"impure" moves, ie a move that not only renames something, but also 
changes something (commonly the comments at the top of the file). Maybe 
you simply didn't have anything like that, but I thought I'd mention it 
just in case you tried to avoid it on purpose.
The reason I really want the whole series to be compileable is that 
especially with a lot of people using "git bisect", if you have something 
that doesn't compile in the middle, not only does it show that the series 
wasn't a series, it also means that you cannot automate the bisect and you 
need manual intervention.
