I'd really like to move the nvram part to mac_fb_find_mode() in macmodes.c, so
it will work automagically for all drivers on PowerMac.
I'd also like to remove the `vmode' and `cmode' `video=' arguments, in favor of
the archictecture-neutral `<xres>x<yres>[-<bpp>][@<refresh>]' and
`<name>[-<bpp>][@<refresh>]' arguments (which already work on mac, BTW).
You can already use `mac<vmode>' instead of `vmode:<vmode>'.
IMHO, the less PowerMac-specific code in _each_ driver, the better.
