I just switched to the >=beta4 lvm IOP for all 64bit archs. The previous
one (the 2.4 mainline one) isn't feasible on the archs with 32bit
userspace and 64bit kernel (it uses long). The IOP didn't changed btw,
only the structures changed silenty.

It's not a matter of the ondisk format, the on-disk format didn't
changed of course, it's the ioctl format between userspace and kernel 
that changed and the userspace only knows about 1 format. Once IOP
changes (or IOP breaks silenty as in this case) you have to upgrade
userspace with the current design.
