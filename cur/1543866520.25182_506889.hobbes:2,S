I had the same thought.

Okay, that makes sense.

Yes.  In fact, the current existing code does not handle dr6 correctly.  
It never clears the register, which means you're likely to get into 
trouble when multiple breakpoints (or watchpoints) are enabled.
Here's another complication -- and this is one I can't figure out any easy
solutions for.  The type of API we've been discussing will work well
enough on UP systems, but what about SMP?  I don't see any value in having
a kernel watchpoint enabled on some CPUs and not others.  But then what
should happen when a debug register is in use by kwatch and a ptrace
request on one CPU usurps it (leaving no other register in which to put
it)?  Not to mention the difficulties of keeping track of everything when
the same kwatch watchpoint is stored in different debug registers on
different CPUs.
It's really quite a tricky matter.  Should a register be allocated to
kwatch only when no user process needs it?  Should we really go about
checking the requirements of every single process whenever a kwatch
allocation request comes in?  What if the processes which need a
particular register aren't running -- should the register then be given to
kwatch?  What if one of those processes then does start running on one
CPU?
