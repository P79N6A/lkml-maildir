	A better thing (I think) I was thinking about would be to have it so that
only people on the list could post to it, and posts w/ '[lk]' in the subject.  Then
if someone posts w/o being on the list (Or part of the digest or whatever), and
the email doesn't have '[lk]' in the Subject coming in, it gets bounced back w/
instructions to plop '[lk]' in the subject and re-submit, and/or it can be
forwarded to some person(s) for manual checking of the message, and they can
resubmit it to the list w/ [lk] in the subject if it looks reasonable...
