I believe closed source drivers are an acceptable evil for two cases:
- - We do not have an open source alteranive yet, and so we need one to
use while that's being developed
- - The hardware is obscure and nobody cares enough to write a driver anyway
open source drivers are better becaus I can just recompile them for new
hardware.  Get a PPC?  Have a USB cam?  Rebuild the kernel for PPC with
OSS drivers.  Can't do that with binaries.  Can't security audit the
source code of binaries either.  :)
