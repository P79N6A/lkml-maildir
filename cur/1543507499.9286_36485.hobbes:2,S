It is certainly in the government's best interest to be vague about
exactly what is covered by crypto regs, and they are.  The US crypto
regulations get their power because they can intimidate people into
not doing things that the courts would not let them outlaw.  The more
precisly the regulations are defined the less intimidating they are.
If you want to know the answer to your question, basically you have to
go ahead and do it and see if they try to put you in jail.  If you are
like me you don't want to do this.  See why its vague?
