Yeap. The idea of check_var is to validate a mode. Note modedb uses just
check_var. It is okay to READ the values in your par. You shouldn't alter
the values in par.

Correct. Check_var is always called. Now if you wanted to just test a mode
via userland with the FB_ACTIVATE_TEST flag then only fb_check_var is
called. If you pass in FB_ACTIVATE_NOW then both fb_check_var and
fb_set_par will be called. Fb_set_par actually sets the hardware state.

Actually you can look at info->var. Info->var has been validated so it can
be trusted. You don't need to stuff everything into par. You DO need to
change info->fix if the hardware state has changed.

I hope me input helped.
BTW docs are on the way. I will work with Steven Luther on this the next
couple of days.

You go the logic down.
P.S
 For the pmu_sleep_notifier can you pass in a specific struct fb_info or
do you need to make a list of all of them?
