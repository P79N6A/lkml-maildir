Because we still need the partitioning code for backwards
compatibility. There's no way I'm going to use initrd to do partition
setup with lvmtools etc.
Also, lvm and friends are _heavyweight_. The partitioning stuff should be
_one_ add (and perhaps a range check) at bh submit time. None of this
remapping crap. We don't need no steenking overhead for something we need
to do anyway.
