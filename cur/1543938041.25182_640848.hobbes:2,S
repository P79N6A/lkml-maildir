Excuse my ignorance but why wouldn't this work:
static numanode_t pxm_to_node_map[MAX_PXM_DOMAINS]
                                = { [0 ... MAX_PXM_DOMAINS - 1] = NUMA_NO_NODE };
...

	   numanode_t node = pxm_to_node_map[pxm];
	   if (node != NUMA_NO_NODE) {

or change:
	#define NID_INVAL       (-1)
to
	#define NID_INVAL       ((numanode_t)(-1))
...
	   if (node != NID_INVAL) {

Though why there two "node invalid" values I'm not sure... ?

And btw, shouldn't the pxm value be sized to numanode_t size as well?
Will it ever be larger than the largest node id?
Thanks,
