Adam,
I expect the answer is that we need to dig out the old one.
Previously I don't think the full cmpxchg semantics werere required unless the 
box is smp -- there's no case where atomic operations are required for 
hardware interaction, for example.  ...
Probably this changed with preempt, though, so we need one even on UP boxes...
