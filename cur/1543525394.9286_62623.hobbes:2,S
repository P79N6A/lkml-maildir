Once I saw his post (I missed it in my email, but I have the link to the
post on one of the archives) and started changing drivers that I used.  I
haven't worked on the pcmcia/cardbus ones yet, but the smc cards and dmfe I
did modify.  smc-ultra I have (8016) is working.
Unless asked, I'm not releasing a patch to what I did (It's probably wrong,
a few 'error' checks were bypassed in a driver or 2)
