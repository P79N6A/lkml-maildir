  Exactly ;)
  Difference with having it in just certain applications like Gnome-VFS
  etc is that it would work with all applications, over SMB shares
  etc. This is a great advantage and benefit for many desktop users
  but also in a corporate environment. Even though there are backups
  of users documents it is a pain to restore them every time they
  loose the original file. Besides, the backup is never as fresh
  either.
