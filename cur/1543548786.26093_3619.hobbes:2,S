The same happens for OHCI on new Macs. The correct function to use is:
pci_enable_device(dev);
This function will enable the i/o, mem and irqs, and assign them if they
were not assigned for some reason, too.
And you should use it on any PCI device you want to use before using
it, on all architectures. Also check its return value.
