Thanks!

Yes I started the development of this thing when FUNCTION_TRACER was
still FTRACE and I kept the old and confusing
name.

Ok.
And concerning the constraint fixed in assembly. That's strange my
compiler didn't even warn me about it.
Thanks for these three fixes.

Yes. I forgot it into the project section. But it will be implemented :-)

Right. I first chose function_return but it was the largest tracer
name and so raised a bug that has been corrected
since. And I kept this confusing name.
I'm not sure function_full is really the good one because it's not
really a full version of the function tracer. It doesn't do the same
thing: when you look into a trace done by the function tracer, the
functions appear in order of their call whereas with the function
return tracer, they appear in the order of their return which is not
the same. The effect is not the same.
Why not function_return or something like that?
