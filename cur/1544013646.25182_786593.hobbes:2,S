actually pretty much all PC distros no longer ship with CONFIG_IDE,
only libata.
And afaik the box that that bootchart came from only has SATA devices
and the bios is also configured as such.. so not even libata sees IDE
devices.

yeah in the current patch that is exactly the case.
I don't know the libata code enough to know if it's safe to do
otherwise. The code was structured such that it looked VERY deliberate
to do these two things in separate steps.

I would think so but someone from the libata/scsi world needs to say
so.. I didn't want to break the world entirely yet.

I need that capability for something else anyway 
(and have a patch to do this in general, I just need to dust it off and
see if it's still any good)
[in case you're curious: if you boot without initrd, and have a
touchpad, right now the kernel will wait for the touchpad probing to be
done explicitly before trying to mount the rootfs; on many laptops that
I have access to that touchpad probing can easily take 7 seconds. The
patch I have gets rid of that delay by just trying, for most cases
it'll just be there anyway]

yeah likewise before freeing initmem... pretty much the same reason.
I'm not worried about that too much; at some point you just have to
serialize. no big deal.
