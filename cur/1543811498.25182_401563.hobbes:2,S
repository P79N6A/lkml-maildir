Hi!
I'm checking 2.6.16-rc5 with 2 QLogic 2312 adapters using qla2xxx
driver from 2.6.16-rc5.
As with earlier kernels, I think > 2.6.12 (since scsi_transport_fc
gained functionality) I have the following problem.
2 scsi hosts available, 4 and 5 (for QLogic).
I disconnect the cable from one of QLogic cards. After timeout I have
the message
rport-4:0-0: blocked FC remote port time out: removing target and saving binding
and appropriate SCSI devices that came from adapter 4 disappear from
/proc/scsi/scsi.
So far, so good.
I reconnect the cable, the directory
/sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-4:0-1 appears along with the old
ones rport-4:0-0 and rport-5:0-0, so currently I have 3.
However, no automatic rescan appears on adapter 4.
What's worse, if I try echo "0 1 0" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host4/scan
the process is stuck.
Please advise.
Thanks,
Maxim.
