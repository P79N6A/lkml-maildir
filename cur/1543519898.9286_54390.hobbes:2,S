Ah, but I was talking about the much worse, but just as deadly (only
one CPU required):
	grab_lock_irqsave()
	if (error) {
		/* Missing "spin_unlock_irqrestore" */
		return;
	}
	[...]
		irq_begins
		grab_lock ()
The moral of YOUR story is to always use 
	spinlock_irqsave
which does the "cli ()" BEFORE grabbing the lock. (instead of thinking
that there is something that can be done with interrupts enabled, but
wiht the lock taken) right?
