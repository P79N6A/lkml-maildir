I'm with you on that.  People who clammer ignorantly about image size
without looking at what they actually need should have opened their eyes in
the last few years.  Flash and RAM sizes under 32M are nearly unheard of
now-a-days.
It would be a real disaster to construct a screwy and hard-to-maintain
config system in order to achieve something that isn't necessary.  Image
size does matter sometimes but a _maintainable_ and easy to use config
system is far more important.
There are cases where squeezing the image is necessary for extremely
specific applications of the system but those are darn rare now.
