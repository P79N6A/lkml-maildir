I assume there is the same version of eepro driver in 2.2.21-pre2 and 2.4.17.
Version included in kernel 2.2.20 is broken, becouse sometime ethernet card
"dies" - I can't ping it from outside. However, when eepro card is in server,
and I ping workstation from there - card works again. So my current solution is
script which pings everything in localnet all the time.
But new version works much worse for me. In 2.2.21-pre2 and 2.4.17 card never
dies - it always work, but there are many problems with connections. I thought
it's problem with MASQ, but it behaves exactly the same on 2.2 and 2.4. When I
send single file by scp - I have transfer bigger than 100KB/s. But when I watch
WWW or use p2p - transfer is very small or stops.
Driver from 2.2.20 works bad, newer driver works bad, too, but in another way.
Where can I find older releases of eepro driver? How can I contact author
(email from eepro.c doesn't work) ? Is anyone still using EtherExpress ISA 10 ?
