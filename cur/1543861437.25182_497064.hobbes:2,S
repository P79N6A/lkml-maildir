It's not BE that is the problem -- drepper thought of that.
What he fundamentally missed was the calling convention where 64-bit
arguments have to be 64-bit aligned, even when they're passed through
registers.  So:
int foo(int, long long);
takes its arguments in arg0, arg2 and arg3, but glibc passes the syscall
arguments in arg0, arg1 and arg2.
I think the Right Way to fix this is for some gcc hacker to implement an
__attribute__((packed_args)) that changes the calling convention for
that function, then we can define asmlinkage to use that on mips and
parisc.
Any budding gcc hackers out there?  ;-)
