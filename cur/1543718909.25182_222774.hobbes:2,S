Scatter-lists with DMA operations are quite common. Many Ethernet
controllers that perform bus-master DMA use a chip that is either
a (PLX) PCI 9080 or pretty-much a clone.
The problem is that DMA does data-transfer to physical locations.
If you only have one physical location (a page in DMA-able memory)
its virtual to physical translation needs to be done only once.
But, if you expect to write to/from user-mode buffers, the translation
needs to be done every time the scatter-list is built. This is not
some simple operation since user's pages are assembled from anywhere
into what looks like contiguous space to the user, but physically
can be anywhere. So somebody has got to scan a bunch of page-tables
looking for the user's pages every time you build the scatter-list,
i.e., every DMA transfer. This will surely take much more time than
the current scheme.
