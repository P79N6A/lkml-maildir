And you seem to think that an IDE maintainers listing provides you with
a magical wand that says what goes and doesn't. You might want to check
if that hat is fits too tightly.  Generally, I'd like folks to help out.
And generally, I like people to provide code comments that are to the
point - or, even better, show what they mean with a patch. If you have
no technical arguments except saying 'crap', then don't expect me to put
much value into your comments.

I'm really sick of having this debate, it's a complete waste of time.
I'm not looking for your approval or anything in that order, and since
we don't agree all the points in solving this problem, there's no point
in continuing.

A few of the points. Your main argument on the pre/post flush business
makes zero sense still, and that seems to be the heart of your
'crappola' argument.
I already said that I can move the business of queueing post/pre flushes
into the block core instead. You seem to the very way of using pre/post
flushes to provide barriers, and to that I can only say tough shit.
Unless you can pull a rabbit out of your hat and suggest something
better, then your 'crappola' argument holds absolutely no grounds
whatsoever. The pre/post flush approach has worked successfully, it's
been tested extensively, and it works. Your pipe dreams of absolutely no
substance need no further comments.

I don't know why you keep thinking this is my job to complete this
project 100% on my own?! There's a general problem that needs solving,
and I would hope that others would be willing to help out where needed.
I would encourage people to help out if they care about the issue.
I'm not going to comment further on your mails in this thread, unless
they have substantial technical comment. Your 'crap' arguments so far
have been largely unsubstantiated, and as such they don't accomplish
much except waste time.
