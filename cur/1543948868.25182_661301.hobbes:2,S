There are several things here. I've spoken to several people about this
and the belief I've gotten from most of them is that a recommended
attribute is how this is to be transported. The NFSv4 spec people will
probably say that if you want xattr like functionality for NFSv4 use
named attributes. For us this is not an option since we require
semantics to label on create/open and the only way we can do this is by
adding a recommended attribute. The create/open calls in NFSv4 takes a
list of attributes to use on create as part of the request. I really
don't see a difference between the security blob and the
username/groupname that NFSv4 currently uses. Also there is a good
chance that we will need to translate labels at some point (read future
work).

I can only speak for myself but honestly I've only seen Casey act
confrontational to this idea from the beginning. There is absolutely
nothing in here that is SELinux specific, tecnically its not even MAC
specific. I said from the beginning that this was perhaps not the best
name and we are willing to change it. There is nothing in this hook that
wasn't in LSM before. This is almost identical functionality to what
Adrian removed in 2.6.24. The only difference between this and
security_inode_getsuffix is that this returns security.suffix and that
the name is different. I don't have a SMACK box to test it on but I'm
99% sure that if Casey tried to use SMACK with this patch set that he
would have labeled nfs working with SMACK. If it doesn't work with SMACK
right now I'm willing to help him with that and even include it in the
patch set. But spreading FUD about how we are including SELinux specific
code in here is just that.
