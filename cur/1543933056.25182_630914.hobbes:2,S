Great.  We were talking about having something like this recently on
the ARM lists.  ARCH_MIN_DMA_ALIGNMENT for ARM would always be
L1_CACHE_BYTES on current CPUs.

You introduce __dma_buffer_line() if ARCH_MIN_DMA_ALIGNMENT is set but
not if it isn't...

... but it's not described.  What's the purpose of it, and why would it
only be used on CPUs with ARCH_MIN_DMA_ALIGNMENT set?
