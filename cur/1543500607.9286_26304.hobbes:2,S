Hi,
        We are running a slink debian distribution with kernel 2.0.36 on a
celeron 333 as our file server. Our SCSI adapter is an Adaptec 2940UW PCI card,
with this configuration:
        2940UW Adapter
                |
        Seagate Barracuda 9.1gig UW 
                |
        Quantum Viking II 9.1gig UW 
                |
        Sony AIT Tape Drive
                -TERMINATION.
The Adaptec configuration program correctly recognises all the devices, and the
system runs fine 99% of the time.  However, when the system is under heavy disk
usage, it sometimes suddenly cold reboots, eg: today while gunzipping a large
.gz archive on the Barracuda drive the system rebooted.  similar examples
include copying large files from Windows/Samba clients to the server, and
copying 3-4 gigabytes of files from the Barracuda to the Viking, using the unix
'cp' command.
We have checked all the termination, and log files.  Physical
termination all appears to be correct, and there are no clues in the log
files...the system simply cold reboots without leaving any error
messages.
Has anybody ever experienced these symptoms?  Could it be due to a bug in the
2.0.36 kernel, or is it more likely an undetected hardware issue?
Thanks,
