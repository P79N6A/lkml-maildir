a. This has been mentioned over and over again on LKML for months now.
b. <
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/patches/2.5/>
 has a partial fix,
   but read the README there first. Dave Jones' -dj kernel patch kit
   also includes it.
c. The patch only fixes the oopses and repairs raw access. I'm not
   working on repairing VFS since I don't have time for that and can
   live without it for now. I had hoped that the VFS hackers who broke it
   in the first place would have fixed it, but that's not been the case.
