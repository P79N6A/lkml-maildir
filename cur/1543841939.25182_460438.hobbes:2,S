Agreed. The solution is to make the VFS little friendlier to stackable
filesystems. I'm not sure what the best way of accomplishing that would be.
There are some papers about it [1], but my gut feeling is that they are way
too invasive.

The unionfs (as well as any other stackable filesystem) case can be fixed up
by making the VFS aware of the stack - for example, by having some kind of
stackable filesystem callbacks.
