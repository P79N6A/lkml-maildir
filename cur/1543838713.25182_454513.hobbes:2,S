Please add an arch/avr32/defconfig.
The purposes of a defconfig are:
- starting point for people compiling their own kernel
- usable configuration for compile tests
It doesn't need to be anything special, e.g. a working .config from a 
machine you are using would be a suitable defconfig.
TIA
Adrian
BTW: What is the status of getting avr32 support into upstream
     binutils and gcc?

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
