Dream on, as it won't happen. Just think of either:
- All pieces _have_ to be the same version: What is the use then? Just ship
  them together and be done. Splitting it up is extra work, plus the
  complaints that core-2.8.3 now doesn't work with ia32-2.6.9 and foo, bar,
  baz drivers of assorted other versions.
- You can mix and match: Great! Just who will do the testing and documentation
  of what works with what?
Major pain and much extra work to developers (remember, Linux' objective is
being fun to hack on, the "World domination. Fast." thing is just FUD ;)
for minor convenience to some users and major pain to all the rest.

Have you really looked at the size of the other architectures? Here I have
2.2.18pre15: 
arch + include/asm-*: 14929
All                 : 88121
A 16% of the total is architecture-dependent. Sure, much of the drivers you
don't use. But then again, how much did your HDD cost? How much for the
space the sources take up? How much did the sources cost you?
