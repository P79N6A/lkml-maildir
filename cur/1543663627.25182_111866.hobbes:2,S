Another idea:
4) Back off quickly (i.e. disable ECN on first retry), but keep track
of whom you had to do this for. Then use some clever user-mode
strategy module to act on this information. (E.g. send a list of ECN
offenders to root, or raise the threshold value for turning off ECN
for destinations that seem to accept ECN in general, but suffer high
losses.)
