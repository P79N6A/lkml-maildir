Disabling MSI is not always safe.   The InfiniPath PCIe adapter has no
other way to interrupt, for example.
The original patch (which you are proposing reverting to, or so it
appears to me), causes our chip to not work at all on any motherboard
which has both 8131 and PCIe slots (and there are at least 2 or 3 of
those, including supermicro and HP), despite the fact that the 8131
problem is irrelevant to PCIe on Nvidia or other root complexes.
We (PathScale/QLogic) are having to tell people to patch their
kernels in order for the InfiniPath PCIe adapter to work, on such systems.
