Possible bug in partition table code of Kernel 2.2.3 / 2.2.4 / 2.2.5
(I sent this already to Remy Card (as the closest match in MAINTAINERS),
but didn't get any answer yet...)
[1.] when using Kernel 2.2.3/2.2.4/2.2.5 I can't mount my 640M MO disks
(sectorsize 2048, 1 primary partition, ext2 formatted) anymore.
[2.] The disks were formatted with 2.1.128 / 2.1.129 / 2.1.131 / 2.2.0 /
2.2.1. It worked like a charm with those kernels. But when I upgraded from
2.2.1 to 2.2.3 mount gave me a "wrong fs type, bad option, ..." error (of
course I used *exactly* the same options as before). Booting 2.2.0 and
mounting them works, so it's no hardware problem.
I did a "dd if=/dev/sdc1 of=sdc1.img bs=2048 count=2048" both under 2.2.3
and 2.2.0 and the results were differing. Under 2.2.0 the partition start
looks like a normal ext2fs (compared with my hdd partitions), under 2.2.3
it seems as if reading starts at a different position - I didn't compare it
exactly, but the 2.2.3 dump seems to start 14k bytes *after* the 2.2.0 one.
fdisk shows no errors.
I haven't tested it yet with other filesystems and 230M disks (blocksize
512).

Shouldn't sdc be larger than sdc1?

Update: fdisk in normal mode lists sdc1 with "620528 Blocks", in expert
mode it says "Size 1241056". 
Well, that's all info I can find now...
