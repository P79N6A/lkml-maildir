The simplest explanation that makes any sense to me is that the
non-realtime threads are interfering with the realtime ones.  These
threads don't do much in this test, although they would in a real
audio application.  Still, there are enough things going on before and
after the sleep() in the main thread to possibly generate the number
of xruns we're seeing.
This is why I don't think nice is an appropriate solution for the
problem we're trying to solve.  It's too blunt an instrument for audio
work.

I think you're missing the fact that SCHED_FIFO is per-thread while
nice() is per-process.
