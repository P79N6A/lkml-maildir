Yep, I had a similar problem on my old Gateway Solo 2150 that was 
rectified by a bios upgrade. Under windows it would happen rarely, but 
it did occur, under Linux it was unusable. A bios upgrade for the 
keyboard controller fixed both :p)
In this case, it is caused by polling ACPI status. Only under 2.5 
though, 2.4 works perfectly.
