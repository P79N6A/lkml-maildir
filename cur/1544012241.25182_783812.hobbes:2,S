Yes, it was that way in the earlier version, but I thought we introduced
CONFIG_PID_NS only to hide the ugliness resulting from pid-ns. Ok. I
will revert.

| Hmm... why do you want this? The user-space can use any si_code >= 0,

I thought losing a SIGKILL, however twisted the path, was serious enough
to justify the ugliness. Again, I am not particular.

I was wondering if I should there too :-) But what do you think ?
