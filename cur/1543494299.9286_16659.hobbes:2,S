You have some service defined as running on localhost but it is not
present.  Since you get this for ftp/telnet/browsing/email, the service
is probably DNS.  Check /etc/resolv.conf, do you have "nameserver
localhost" or "nameserver 127.0.0.1"?  If so, are you really running
DNS on your box?  If the missing service is not DNS, as root run
"tcpdump -nlpilo" to see which service you are trying to access.
Either way, you need to start the service or change the config for the
missing service to remove localhost.
