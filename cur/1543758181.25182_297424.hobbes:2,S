Subject: [PATCH] make highmem_start access only valid addresses (i386)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/2/25/131

When CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y, but ZONE_NORMAL isn't quite full, there is, of course,
no actual memory at *high_memory.  This isn't a problem with normal
virt<->phys translations because it's never dereferenced, but CONFIG_NONLINEAR
is a bit more finicky.  So, don't do __va() in non-existent addresses.
BTW, this can certainly wait until the 2.6.12 series.
