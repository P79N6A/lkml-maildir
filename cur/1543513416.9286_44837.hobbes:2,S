device 08:01 is the major/minor number. Look in /dev. It is
probably /dev/sda1
Block 87 is corrupt.

This is probably /dev/sdc9 (08:41).
Block 164 is corrupt.

This is probably /dev/sdb5 (08:21).
Block 8279 is corrupt.

Same as previous. Shows a probable real error.
..etc,..etc,.. With SCSI, bad cables corrupt data, but not the disk
blocks. In other words, a bad cable or improper termination may cause
garbage to be written. However, the garbage can be read back because
the hardware makes the correct CRC even though you wrote junk. In your
case, you have some real CRC errors (bad blocks on the disks).
I suggest you get everything off those disks as soon as possible.
Cheers,
