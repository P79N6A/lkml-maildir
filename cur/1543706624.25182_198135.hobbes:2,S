Nope, it's been tolerant of all 254 bit patterns except \0 and '/'
since at least AIX 3.1.2 back in the early 90s.  It doesn't even have
a concept of "UTF-8 filename" - it considers that a userspace issue.
Now, over the last 15 years I've tripped over a number of *userspace*
things that did really stupid things when handed non-ASCII filenames,
but that's a different issue...
