Did you ever try using "acpi=off" together with "i8042.nomux=1"? That
could help with the rebooting problem (iirc, you had a multiplexing
controller, didn't you?). Also, if you could try whether "usb-handoff"
instead of "acpi-off" has the same effect, like it has for Sebastian,
that'd be a good data point, too.
