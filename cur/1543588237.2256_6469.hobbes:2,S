"verified" is the really important part with this driver, since its
really finicky.  I have a patch I would love to bounce to you in
private, that I have been searching for a tester for -months- because I
had no test hardware of my own.
Your patch looks ok to me and I would say apply it.  But I also think it
is incomplete.
* there is no need for a linked list of cards, since
pci_{get,set}_drvdata is used.  This eliminates the list walk in
nm256_remove
* the new PCI API has suspend/resume hooks, and those should be used in
preference to register_pm_...
* there is rarely a need to compare PCI ids manually in a driver.  Do
this implicitly by using the struct pci_device_id::driver_data field. 
In the following code, you could simply pass these two strings as your
driver_data:
> +    if (pcidev->device == PCI_DEVICE_ID_NEOMAGIC_NM256AV_AUDIO)
> +       return nm256_install(pcidev, REV_NM256AV, "256AV");
> +    if (pcidev->device == PCI_DEVICE_ID_NEOMAGIC_NM256ZX_AUDIO)
> +       return nm256_install(pcidev, REV_NM256ZX, "256ZX");
* typically you don't want to -always- printout the module version when
built into the kernel.  that can get ugly, when you have a bunch of
drivers in the kernel.  you should surround the existing version printk
code with ifdef MODULE, and then add some additional code in your
pci_driver::probe routine which looks something like
	#ifndef MODULE
		static int printed_version;
		if (!printed_version++)
			printk(version);
	#endif
and further, declare your version string like the following code, so it
can be dropped from the kernel image...
	static char version[] __devinitdata =
	KERN_INFO "... version ...\n";
Looks good, thanks for the work!  If you spot any other drivers you can
convert, feel free.
