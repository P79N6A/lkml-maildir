Mr. Miller,
	It almost isn't. The problem starts when a third-party protocol
module grabs BR_NETPROTO_LOCK, unloads itself from the networking stack,
and then tries to call ip6_conntrack_protocol_unregister(). Deadlock.
The problem is that we need TWO locks: the brlock to seal the network stack,
and the conntrack rwlock to delete the protocol struct. Sure, you can
always share the rwlock and leave it at that, but if all you need it for
is to load/unload your protocol functions, then why bother polluting
the symbol tables?
	What do you think? Share the rwlock and make everybody who has
the brlock just use the core function?
