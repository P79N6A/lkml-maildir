True.  But you have to go through ext2_get_branch (under the big kernel
lock) - if we can do only one logical->physical block translations,
why doing it multiple times?

This does not replicated the code.  The 'normal' filesystems share the
code, and the special filesystems want to their own clustering anyway.
