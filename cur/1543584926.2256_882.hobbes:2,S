Yes, I know you _can_ do all sorts of tricks like this, but most people
don't really do it.  In any case, I would be happy if I could even get
"/mnt" from the first mount.  If it comes to the point where I can get
that, then I will start to worry about "mount --bind".
This is to store in the ext2 on-disk superblock, which is currently always
(from dumpe2fs -h /dev/hdX):
Last mounted on:          <not available>
To be able to put _something_ there will suit my needs.
Cheers, Andreas
