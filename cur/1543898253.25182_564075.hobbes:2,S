Thanks, but these docs are about what the ioctls do, and I'm totally
uninterested in that.  What I'm interested is how the ioctl data is
_structured_.
OK, had a look at <linux/soundcard.h>, it does define a data
structuring based on the ioctl numbers, and it's just slightly
different from the structuring defined by <asm-generic/ioctl.h>.  Oh,
the beauty of the ioctls.
So answering my own question: no, it's not sanely possible to support
ioctls through fuse without userspace hacks or significant effort.
A possibly acceptable option is to add a plugin mechanism, whereby
people could write small ioctl interpreter kernel modules for their
specific needs (such as parsing OSS ioctls), which would
serialize/deserialize any type of ioctl input/output making them
suitable for transfering between the kernel and the userspace
filesystem.
Another, much more complex option is to design a generic ioctl data
interpreter language, and let the filesystem upload their ioctl
parsers into the kernel.
