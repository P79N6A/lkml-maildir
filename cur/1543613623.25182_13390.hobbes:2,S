I don't want to bring in any ...-Design if standard tools are enough! If
cpio/tar do suffice, then much better. I don't know if they are simple and
fitting enough to be handled by any boot loader and the kernel. Maybe you could
elaborate more on this.
You have to admit that a multiple streams file format (regardless which kind)
would be a good solution to the booting of a modular kernel. Anyway this format
has to be supported by the kernel itself and in some extend by any boot loader.
So anybody has to write a kernel module for the cpio/tar format and help with
implementing it into  boot loaders. Maybe you could give some help.
