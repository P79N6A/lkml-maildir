You want to copy the top-level page table directory (with the "present
bit" disabled or something), not just retain a pointer to it. Otherwise
you just get really confused after two fork() calls, where you can have
multiple "backing page tables".

Don't unconditionally prefault. There are many potentially useful things
that do _not_ want to do this, for example snapshot creation.
So the generic "do_fork()" thing should _not_ do prefaulting, although
"sys_fork()"  may well choose to do it.
