I see a problem: increased latency and lower bandwith whenever 
a long seek comes up.  This will loose badly in the case when 
a process reads from two files at either end of the disk.
"diff" and "patch" springs to mind, particularly when the
patchfile and source-tree are on different partitions.
A read from one file waits before the long jump to the other,
not realising that no read for the first area will happen until
the other area is read & processed.  
I might even be able to speed up
patching by running something disk-intensive in between the
two files, as this would shorten the distance preventing waiting.

Seems to me that page-tuning the executable code is the best
solution here.  It will minimize the number of early accesses,
minimize the working code-set, and give a linear layout that
works well with read-ahead.
