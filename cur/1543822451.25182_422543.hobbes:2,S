The argument has been that it is desirable to be able to unshare these
namespaces - uid, pid, network, sysv, utsname, fs-namespace -
separately.  Are you talking about having these all be part of a single
namespace unshared all at once (and stored in struct namespace)?  Or am
I misunderstandimg you entirely?
Andi Kleen (I believe) thinks it should be like that, all or nothing.  I
think Herbert Poetzl had current examples where vserver is used to
unshare just pieces, i.e. apache unsharing network but sharing global
pidspace.
