Hi,
I have read your rlimit patch - very nice.
However, why not add display of rlim_max (hard limit) also, since this can
also change on a per-process basis.
However, displaying PIPE_BUF may cause the wrath of Single UNIX spec
purists, as it is not defined as one of the RLIM_ constants (neither by
the the spec nor by Linux implementation), and is not a per-process
resource limit.
Regards,
Tigran.
