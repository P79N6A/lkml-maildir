Well if they're zero then perhaps they should be released to the page allocator
to satisfy the next __GFP_ZERO request.  If that request is for a pagetable
page, we break even (except we get to remove special-case code).  If that
__GFP_ZERO allocation was or some application other than for a pagetable, we
win.
iow, can we just nuke 'em?
(Will require some work in the page allocator)
(That work will open the path to using the idle thread to prezero pages)
