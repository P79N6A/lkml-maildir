Subject: [PATCH 2.6.21-rc6-rt0] ns2cyc() result fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Fix the dubious use of cycles_t where cycle_t was appropriate.  On the machines
with 32-bit cycles_t (like ARM/PPC) it caused these warnings:
In file included from arch/powerpc/kernel/time.c:1045:
include/linux/clocksource.h: In function `ns2cyc':
include/linux/clocksource.h:213: warning: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast
include/linux/clocksource.h:213: warning: right shift count >= width of type
include/linux/clocksource.h:213: warning: passing argument 1 of `__div64_32' from incompatible pointer type
This function and therefore usecs_to_cycles() was unlikely to return a correct
result on such machines because of the shift result truncation.

I'm also uncertain about 'preempt_max_latency' and 'preempt_thresh' variables
being declared as 'unsigned long' -- however, looks like those are unlikely to
overflow... yet it's unclear why there's casts to 'cycle_t' (which is always
64-bit) when initializing/comparing them...
