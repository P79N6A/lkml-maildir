yes, that would be a nice test. (I'm busy now with mutex stuff to be 
able to do a working softirq-preemption patch, but i sent you my current 
patches off-list - if you want to give it a shot. Be warned though, 
there will likely be quite some merging work to do, so it's definitely 
not for the faint hearted.)
