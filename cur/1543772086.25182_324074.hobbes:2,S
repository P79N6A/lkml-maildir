We modify the existing Linux TCP stack to add "hooks" so that our card can 
perform TCP offload and HW based checksum, thus making it possible to see high 
throughput with multiple connections and low CPU utilization.
We add 2 source files to the kernel, toedev.c and offload.c. We also modify 
neighbor.c, tcp.c, tcp_diag.c, tcp_ipv4.c, tcp_timer.c to add functions for our 
TOE capabilities so that the offloaded packet can be sent to our hardware 
(offload) path instead of going through the software (TCP stack) path.
Our processing engine is an ASIC with a HW based TCP stack which processes 
packets with Chelsio's CPL messages (Chelsio Protocol Language). I would not 
consider it a derived work.
