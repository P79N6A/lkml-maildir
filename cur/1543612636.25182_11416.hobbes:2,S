Does a simple 'dd' show the problem? I mean,
time dd if=/dev/zero of=/somelargefile count=somelargenumber bs=8k
is it much slower on the itanium, too? dd doesn't use putc(), I hope.
Just for comparison, I've run the following command here:
# time dd if=/dev/zero of=/u2/test count=250000 bs=8k
250000+0 records in
250000+0 records out

You may try with a bigger file, expecially if you have more RAM.
