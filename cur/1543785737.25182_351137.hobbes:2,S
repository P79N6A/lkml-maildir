You can't sort /bin/ls into /tmp/ls and expect /tmp/ls to be meaningfull,
but /bin/ls works as expected. You can't usurally concat perl scripts and
shell scripts either, but both kinds of script run quite well.
And if you do "cat /bin/cat /bin/cp > /bin/catcp", what's "catcp foo bar"
supposed to do? First output foo and bar to stdout, then copy foo to bar?
Is execve() broken if it doesn't do what I described? Is the ELF header
broken because it's not recogmized EVERYWHERE? I don't think so.

What's supposed to happen if you concatenate a script from your french
user and from your russian user, both using localized text, into one file?
Unless you can guarantee every editor to correctly handle this case, all
usage of 8-bit-characters should be disabled - NOT!
If you concatenate two plain text files, you will use cat.
If you concatenate two pnm image files, you will use pnmcat.
If you concatenate two utf-8 files, you will use utf8cat.
If you concatenate two binaries, you will shoot your feet.
That's easy, isn't it?
BTW: I think decent utf-8 capable programs SHOULD ignore extra BOM markers.

You can *grep utf-8 scripts, but you can't *grep binaries. Shouldn't
this be fixed by implementing an in-kernel ASCII assembler and convert
all binaries to assembler text?

utf-8 filenames will work correctly (unless used as an extended BASIC
script with non-ASCII variable names, but that would be insane).

It's not uncommon to create binaries using other programs. So what?

And an utf-8 script is a utf-8 encoded text file with it's executable bit
set.

In order to make it harder for the interpreter to correctly detect utf-8?
You can have DOS executables run in dosboxes, windows applications run
in windows, java archives run in java, but utf-8 scripts should be
mangled in order to work "correctly", and mangled back in order to be
editable? *That*'s insane!
Just make execve ignore the BOM marker before "#!" as the patch does, and
you're done. The rest is somebody else's not-a-problem.
BTW2: However, I don't like the patch.
I'd first check for a utf-8 signature, and if it's found, adjust the
buffer offset by 3. Then I'd run the old code checking for the sh_bang.
OTOH, I just read the patch and not the .c file, maybe (unlikely) my idea
wouldn't work correctly.
