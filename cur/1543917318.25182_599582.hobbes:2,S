Yeah.  There's no correct answer here (apart from "get it right the first
time").  There are risks either way, and it _is_ a bug.  Bummer.

Funny you should mention that.  I was staring in astonishment at the
pending sysfs patch pile last night.  Forty syfs patches and twenty-odd
patches against driver core and the kobject layer.
That's a huge amount of churn for a core piece of kernel infrastructure
which has been there for four or five years.  Not a good sign.  I mean,
it's not as if, say, the CPU scheduler guys keep on rewriting all their
junk.
oh, wait..
