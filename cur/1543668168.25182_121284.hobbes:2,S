I just upgraded a box with 2 NICs in it to 2.5.66, and found
that what was eth0 in 2.4 is now eth1, and vice versa.
Is this phenomenon intentional ? documented ?
What caused it to do this ?
The box in question has a DEC Tulip and a 3com 3c905,
but I imagine this would affect any system with >1 NIC
of different vendors/drivers ?
