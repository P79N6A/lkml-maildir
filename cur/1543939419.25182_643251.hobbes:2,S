Neither in ISO-8859-1 nor UTF-8 this position contains something meaningful.
Mind to update to UTF-8?

Changelogs go into git, not files, at least that is what was mentioned
time and again.

Probably just me, unsigned int is a good bit more explicit.
The driver may also use a combined struct with
BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD/LITTLE_ENDIAN_BIGFIELD (see e.g. linux/ip.h).

The macros are only used once, could just as well substitute them
by their real values.

While 0444 is probably never going to change its meaning, S_IRUGO comes 
into mind.
