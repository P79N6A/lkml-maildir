Okay, verified now.  Prior to this patch, *both* CPUs were still up and running
when machine_power_off() got called, and there was no guarantee that CPU0 was
the one calling machine_power_off().   BUG.
The above patch guarantees that only the single boot CPU is running
and calling machine_power_off().
Hopefully this buries the SMP-power-off bogeyman for good!
Cheers
