Subject: [PATCH 8/8] Add documentation for extra boot parameters
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/5/135

Once all patches are applied, two new command-line parameters exist -
kernelcore and noeasyrclm. This patch adds the necessary documentation.

+			is used for the allocation of pages on behalf
+			of a process and for HugeTLB pages. On ppc64,
+			it is likely that memory sections on this zone
+			can be offlined. Note that allocations like
+			PTEs-from-HighMem still use the HighMem zone if
+			it exists, and the Normal zone if it does not.
