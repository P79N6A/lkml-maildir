Maybe he should boot the kernel with "hdx=ide-scsi" appended to force
using IDE-SCSI emulation on his CD-RW drive.
Another possibility is reconfiguring cdrecord to use "ATAPI=" or
"/dev/hdx" device naming conventions, thus using ATAPI instead of 
IDE-SCSI. I have been doing this as IDE-SCSI in 2.5 is not stable
enough.
