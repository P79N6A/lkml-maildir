 thanks for the pointer. Definitely gives some very interesting
information about ones x86 CPU. At least something to work on. The
output for different CPU types is a bit incoherent, making it difficult
to parse. That why I [still] think (yes I'm stubborn :-) that having the
cache sizes in /proc/cpuinfo in one format is a good idea. The info is
there, it is just the output. With the userland tool, you always may
have discrepancies between the kernels view and the tools view.
 But I agree, it does not *have* to go into the kernel.
Cheers
MArtin
