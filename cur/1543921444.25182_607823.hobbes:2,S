Let me put it another way.  Looking at /proc/slabinfo I can get 
37 buffer_heads per page.  I can allocate 10% of memory in
buffer_heads before we start to reclaim them.  So it requires just
over 3.7 buffer_heads on very page of low memory to even trigger
this case.  That is a large 1k filesystem or a weird sized partition,
that we have written to directly.
That makes this condition very rare in practice without your patch.
Especially since even after we reach the above condition we have
to have enough vm pressure to find a page with clean buffer heads
that is dirty in the ramdisk.
While it can be done deterministically usually it is pretty hard
to trigger and pretty easy to work around by simply using partition
sizes that are a multiple of 4k and 4k block sized filesystems.

My primary issue with your patch is that it continues the saga the
trying to use buffer cache to store the data which is a serious
review problem, and clearly not what we want to do long term.

For linus's tree the consensus is that to fix rd.c that we
need to have a backing store that is stored somewhere besides
in the page cache/buffer cache for /dev/ram0.   Doing that prevents
all of the weird issues.
Now we have the question of which patch gets us there.  I contend
I have implemented it with my last little patch that this thread
is a reply to.  Nick hasn't seen that just yet.
So if we have a small patch that can implement the proper long
term fix I contend we are in better shape.
As for backports we can worry about that after we get something
sane merged upstream.
