Because a lot of architectures will cause unaligned faults on structures 
that have pointers (or long's) in them if they are only aligned to "int"?
So "int"-aligned is no better than "char" alignment.
I suspect we should make the "minimum normal alignment" be architecture-
dependent, since some architectures can have even stricter requirements
(ie they may have compilers that assume 64-bit alignment for doing things
like multi-word loads).
My suggestion:
 - if explicit alignment is passed in (non-zero), always use that. The 
   user knows best.
   This allows a user to specify unaligned ("byte alignment", aka
   "align=1") if he wants to.
 - if the passed-in alignment was zero, use a CPU-specific alignment which 
   will depend on SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN, and will _usually_ be something like
	align = (flags & SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN) ? cachelinesize : sizeof(ptr);
   but some architecture might choose to do something different here.
Wouldn't that make everybody happy.
