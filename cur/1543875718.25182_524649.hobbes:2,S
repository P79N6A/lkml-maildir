Yeah OK I see what you mean. The name of the function is slightly
counter intutive given it's return semantics. I can't really think of a
better one though, perhaps msi_check_device() ?

See my next patch, which makes the callers pass it back to the drivers,
(nearly) all of which print it to the console.
I think having a meaningful return value is very useful there, having
just spent a while debugging the powerpc backends. I actually have a
debug patch which changes pci_msi_supported() to return -1/-2/-3 etc for
the different cases.
And with my next patch that hooks the arch up, it's even more useful.
Otherwise you're left with no option other than printk debugging.
cheers
