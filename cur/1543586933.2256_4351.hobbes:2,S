There's no need to start it. My brain is either 'always on', or
'suspended to ram' :-)

I agree. that would be the clean solution. Jeff Grazik provided some
sample code, I'll try to write a driver according to this. If I find the
time....
But what I want to know before I spend time (and not-earning-money :-)
into this, I want to know: Is this the right way (TM)? How do other
multiport cards deal with this issue?
This is a specific question to the serial and parallel maintainers: are
there cards supported by _both_ the serial and parallel subsystem? Do
they work with 2.4.3? Will they work in the future? (I'm too lazy to
compare the PCI tables from serial and parallel ;-)
Another (design) question: How will such a driver/module deal with
autodetection and/or devfs? I don't like to specify 'alias /dev/tts/4
netmos', because thats pure junk to me. What about pci hotplugging?
(keep in mind that I'm new to kernel development)

Har har har. Could you please tell me where to get one? I don't know how
it's in your country, but here in austria you can call yourself a lucky
guy if you even find a PCI serial/parallel card. If you find one, you'll
find _one_. It's packaged in a little box where it reads "PCI 2S/1P
board". The 'manual' is a bit larger than a stamp. 
I could buy one after another, and try if they have a well-designed PCI
interface. 
I don't have the time for this.
I agree with you that this kind of hardware is junk. But there's a lack
of alternatives....
If there's a reasonable number of 'good' hardware out there, I'll forget
about Netmos and buy me a new card. If not, I'm willing to provide a
driver. 
bye, Michael
