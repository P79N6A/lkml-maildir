I'm guessing you don't have many symlinks on the exported

The information you sent was very helpful.
You are getting an Oops here:
> 0xc0173769 <nfssvc_encode_diropres+89>:	push   $0x8000
> 0xc017376e <nfssvc_encode_diropres+94>:	push   %ecx

> 0xc0173772 <nfssvc_encode_diropres+98>:	call   *%eax
                                                ^^^^^^^^
%eax is zero.
This corresponds to the code fragment:
+	if (IS_POSIX_ACL(inode) && inode->i_op) {
+		posix_acl_t *acl = inode->i_op->get_posix_acl(
+			inode, ACL_TYPE_ACCESS);
%eax has the value of inode->i_op->get_posix_acl.  Clearly this field
hasn't been initialised.
A quick look at the patch suggests that it doesn't get initialised for
symlinks, but I haven't poured over it in detail.
I must admit that it appears somewhat courageous to be running 2.4.1
with patches that were made for 2.4.0-test12 on a production machine,
but I guess you know what you are doing.

That may be, but you have only given evidence that it that there are
problems with the patches installed, and that evidence points very
strongly at a problem with the patch.  If you can give me evidence (an
Oops for example) which shows problems without the patches, then I
will be happy to look at it.
Also, the most recent ksymoops output is totally useless.  It looks
like the kernel image that ksymoops was using to find symbol
information was different from the kernel image that was running.
It is very important that these two match, or the result is of no use.
