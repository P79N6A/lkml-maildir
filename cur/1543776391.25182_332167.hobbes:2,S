Well, just to let others who have this problem know, it's clear that Ingo's 
rt-preempt patches increase stack pressure on systems (like mine) where stack 
is borderline under 4K by default.
If you disable CONFIG_4KSTACKS the stack overflows seem to disappear. As a 
result, until we isolate the problem, it'd probably be better if Ingo 
maintained an 8K stacks option in the rt-preempt patches assuming Adrian 
Bunk's "kill !4KSTACKS" patch gets into mainline..
