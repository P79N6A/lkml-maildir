Subject: cli/sti removal from linux-2.5.29/drivers/ide?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	linux-2.5.29/drivers/ide has a bunch of calls to cli, sti
and restore_flags.  Documentation/cli-sti-removal.txt describes how
these routines have been removed from the multiprocessor versions of
linux-2.5.29.  Because IDE is such a commonly used subsystem and
because 2.5.29 has been available for almost two days now, I thought
I ought to ask if someone has already made the changes.
	I have not seen any new IDE patches on lkml since 2.5.29 was
released, nor have I seen any other IDE patches that fix this.  Sorry
if I missed a message about it.
