I'm inclined to take the cautious route here - I don't think people will be
dying for the CFS thingy (which I didn't even know about?) in .23, and it's
rather a lot of infrastructure to add for a CPU scheduler configurator
gadget (what does it do, anyway?)
We have plenty of stuff for 2.6.23 already ;)
