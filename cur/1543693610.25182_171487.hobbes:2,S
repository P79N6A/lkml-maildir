Easily solved with a synchronize_irq()  ;-)
As a slight tangent, with MSI coming up, as well as the presence of 
hardware that queues IRQ events asynchronously, we'll want 
synchronize_irq() to handle those cases, even for uniprocess (often 
synchronize_irq is only defined for SMP).

You want to disable_irq() then sleep?  ewww...  :)  I think we could 
figure out a better way...
