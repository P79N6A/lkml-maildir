A combination of /sbin/hotplug notification, and information in the
driverfs tree will enable userspace to create and remove device nodes
whereever and with whatever name they want to.

My main complaint (as the pci hotplug maintainer) is that Mvista isn't
trying to work with the community for their code.  I had a number of
good emails with the main developer (at the time), but unfortunatly I
haven't heard anything in quite some time.  Any proding you might
provide in this area would be greatly appreciated.
Otherwise Mvista is going to be supporting that patch outside of the
main tree for forever, and that can get old and expensive over time.

Yes, that sounds pretty unreasonable :)  What drives such a quick
request turnaround time?

Hm, ok, let me go dig up the patch again, ugh.  Ok, I don't really know
how, but it could proably be done cleaner :)

Yes, ramfs is in 2.4, and the pci hotplug core uses a filesystem just
like this in the 2.4 kernel.  But if you want to keep your patch out of
the kernel, it's fine with me :)

Here, and/or to the linux-scsi mailing list.
