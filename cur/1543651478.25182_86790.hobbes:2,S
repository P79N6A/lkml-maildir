Ah, so exporting those types of functions is not pratical?  Oh well...

Wait, again I'm confused.  Let's go over the main points here:
 - for 2.5 everyone uses the pci_bus_read_config* and
   pci_bus_write_config* functions and is happy.  Well ACPI isn't happy,
   but the code there currently works, so let's leave it at that.
 - for 2.4 we don't have the pci_bus* functions, so we need to do
   something.  I originally wanted to look into exporting the
   pci_config_* function pointers, but you said that doesn't look
   possible based on the different arch specific implementation.
 - Because of this, you just proposed a patch, yet your patch uses the
   pci_bus_* functions which are not present on 2.4.  If they were,
   everyone would be happy again, and not need such a patch, right?
Confused,
