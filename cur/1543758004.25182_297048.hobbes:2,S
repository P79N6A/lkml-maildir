After the rework of kexec patches, there is very minimal kernel code needed
for kdump and most of the code is in user space kexec-tools. The changes
needed in kexec-tools to load the crashdump kernel and generate ELF headers,
for x86 architecture are done and will be posted for comments today by Vivek. 
Currently the work remaining is to capture the old-kernel memory during second 
kernel boot up. There is some lack of consensus whether this functionality 
should go in kernel-space (/proc/vmcore) or user-space (a separate utility
which can be run from initrd). Before the last kexec rework, kdump has the 
facility to do /proc/vmcore and now it has to be re-done accordingly. There is 
some code already done by Eric to do it in user-space. We are evaluating both
the approaches and should arrive at the conclusion asap.
