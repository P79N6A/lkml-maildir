Hi all,
Sorry for a bit of a delay in getting this out - there's been a small but
lengthy thunderstorm outside for a while now. And I don't yet have my UPS :(
I have have a number of comments and ideas for this draft:
	* Quotes from Linus and possibly Alan Cox. Quotes from the two main
        maintainers would be nice, and add to the belief and support behind
	2.2.
	* We need some more sites to go the the "Commercial Programs" section.
	I had hoped that IBM or Compaq would have semi-specialised Linux sites
        like those of Oracle and Corel.
	* Translations of the Press Release. Linux is truely a worldwide entity;	we need to back this up by announcing the release in multiple languages.	I'm not sure how the translations would be done; perhaps possibly we 
	could borrow translators from the distributions.
	* A templete front sheet that local Linux user groups could modify and
	send to local magazines and/or newspapers. I hope to have one
	finalised in the next day or so (by the 20/1 GMT). This would allow a
	number of local contact points for the journalists. It could also
	include meeting locations and times, and a web site.
	* We need a technical press release. This is probably the more
	important of these suggestions, as many (or some) of the industry
	magazines still need to be won over.  I'll help; and parts of the 
	press release that I have edited can be lifted, but it needs to 
	include  more kernel aspects, and less newbie rhetoric. I'll have 
	a look at the changes to the kernel and their associated pages
	(LinuxHQ, ACox's stuff).
Attached is another draft. I've changed some of the quotes, and will attach a
URL in the next draft. Some more web sites have been added. The bit about
downloading the kernel has also changed.
Bye for now,

**** DRAFT **** PRESS RELEASE - LINUX KERNEL 2.2.0 **** DRAFT ****
LINUX KERNEL 2.2
Santa Clara CA, January XX, 1999
Today Linus Torvalds, leader of the Linux software development team, released
a major new version of the Linux operating system. This update brings advanced
scalability, broad support for newer hardware, and a large collection of
low-level features.
Highlights include:
* Advanced network routing and WAN support, which gives Linux the
  ability to replace many expensive proprietary network devices.
  Users can take control of their intranet with priority traffic,
  usage limits, accounting, and virtual private networks. Strong
  256-bit encryption is available as an add-on component.
* New Euro support and a tradition of Y2K readiness positions Linux 2.2 as
  an international operating system ready for the new millenium and beyond.
  
* Enterprise-level network filesystem support, complete with data
  replication for performance, mobility, and reliability.
* Video capture support, TV tuner support, enhanced audio support,
  and other multimedia enhancements.
* Support for a large variety of parallel port devices including
  disk drives, tape drives, and other easy-to-use external devices.
* The already legendary linux performance is significantly enhanced.
  High end SMP scaling gives good performance on 12 processor 
  machines. Linux 2.2 supports up to 64 processor systems.
* With compatibility for BSD and Windows NT filesystems, Linux 2.2 helps
  you leverage your existing UNIX and NT data today, and provides you
  with a strong upgrade path from your existing Windows NT systems tomorrow.
    
Advanced technical users are already using this update, available
from the Internet. Linux vendors will begin shipping fully integrated
systems using the new kernel in March.  Business users will be
able to obtain the update on CD-ROM distributions. The eager may wish to
download Linux 2.2 from the Linux Kernel Archive <
http://www.kernel.org/>.
 To
cope with the massive expected deman for this upgrade, the Linux Kernel
Archive has a whole heirarchy of mirror servers worldwide which are in place
and ready to roll.
BACKGROUND
Linux is a secure network operating system for demanding users.
It interoperates well with a wide variety of other systems.
Linux can take advantage of modern PC and PowerMac hardware
or give new life to older 386 and 486 based computers. Several other
processors, including the 64-bit Alpha and UltraSPARC are also
supported.Support contracts are available from vendors and due to the open
source nature of Linux to numerous third party organisations. Linux is
provided under an unlimited use license that lets users make in-house
customizations to the system itself. Latest estimates suggest that Linux has
up to 20 million users worldwide.
[COMMENT - This next bit is a new section. I think that it should be placed
here, but I am not too firm on its revelance. It can't hurt to mention what
these projects are. Gee, it'd be nice if the 2.2 release could coincide with
the GNOME 1.0 release (hint hint, nudge nudge :-)]
Projects such as GNOME (GNU Network Orientated Model Environment), KDE (K
Desktop Environment) and Enlightenment allow users to completely customize
their Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing quick and easy interaction with
hardware and software through desktop icons, menus, and keyboard shortcuts. As
an alternative, users can chose the window manager fvwm95, which is ready made
to simulate the look and feel of recent releases of Microsoft Windows.
One satisfied user, Scott Hamm, said that "Linux is technically far superior
to any OS created across the earth. It is a robust operating system built to
be a reliable server. Bottom of the line, Linux is the future."
Josh Cohen and Vinod Valloppillil, in a competitive examination of Linux
issued by Microsoft Corporation, wrote that "Linux represents a best-of-
breed UNIX, that is trusted in mission critical applications, and - due to
it's open source code - has a long term credibility which exceeds many
other competitive OS's."
[COMMENT - Is this editing quotes too much? I feel that the people reading the
PR are going to feel a little short changed. However, what has been cut I, and
others, consider too geeky. The above paragraph also mentions the word "UNIX"
(gasp!). I know this was cut earlier. Perhaps I'll cut the above paragraph
altogether, and just use Vinod.]
Valloppillil goes on to say, in an analysis of the Linux development
process, that the model Linux uses "poses a direct [...] platform threat
to Microsoft, particularly in the server space. Additionally, the
[...] free idea exchange in [open source software] has
benefits that are not replicable with our current licensing model." He
continues, stating that "Linux has been deployed in mission critical,
commercial environments with an excellent pool of public testimonials.
Linus Torvalds, originally from Finland, lives with his family in Santa
Clara CA, USA. He and others created Linux as an alternative to
proprietry operating systems after becoming disillusioned with the
poor quality of commercial alternatives.
