I think that is true of a genuine HOWTO. I do wish someone would produce a survey
of the strategies used by major applications, though. It would make assessing
existing solutions for their strengths and weaknesses so much easier. Its
something large numbers of us do independantly, with consequent wasting of
humanity's precious resources. I'm not volunteering, so I can't expect anyone else
to either. It would be real useful, though.
