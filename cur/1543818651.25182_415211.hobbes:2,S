One thing that is clear in the GPL: If you link the kernel with something 
else to an executable, the resulting blob (and therefore the sources to the 
proprietary part) must be GPL.
Linking by making certain parts shared libraries is already a gray zone.
If in doubt, release everything. It also offers users the possibility to 
find your bugs.
