ok.
i'm just reacting on "bloated" wording. It really depends on
implementation and design. If you were talking about amount of code in
the kernel, than take a look on open-iscsi(just one file iscsi_tcp.c)
and IET where we doing a lot of management stuff in user-space. It is
not that much code in the kernel, really, but it is doing x10 times more
useful things comparing to nbd and yet compliant with RFC.

yeah, generic transport, recovery levels, direct data placement for HW
HBAs, etc, etc... it is all *must* features for enterprise's SAN
deployment. So, yes, there is a price as usual.
