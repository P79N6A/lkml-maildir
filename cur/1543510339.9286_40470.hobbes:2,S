I've had this type of crash as well.  Are you using NFS?  As a NFS
client,
I can get my machine to lockup almost every time after loading the
machine
with copying files from an NFS server, then typing a few simple commands
on the NFS client.  See my previous posting for full details.   After my
lockup, I can ping the machine.  The SYSRQ keys do work.  Are you
running
SMP?
Cheers,
