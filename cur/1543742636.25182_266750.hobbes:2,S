This happened to me too.
If you build both ub and usb_storage as modules and only load
usb_storage, then you can't use USB Storage devices any more:
usb_storage doesn't get attached to them (you end up with Driver=none
in /proc/bus/usb/devices). Since ub doesn't appear work with my
unbranded el-cheapo card reader, I wasn't able to use it until I
removed ub from my kernel config and rebuilt.
A friend's got a USB hard disk, and has the same problem with
usb_storage not getting used any more; I don't think he's tried ub
yet, but it's clearly the wrong thing to use for the job anyway.
This is how my card reader appears in /proc/bus/usb/devices with only
usb_storage built as a module:

E:  Ad=83(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS=   2 Ivl=1ms
And these are the errors that I got from ub when trying to mount a
card:
