so because we sucked in the past we can continue to suck? ;)
Why are we still arguing about this? We kernel developers are foxes 
amongst the hens and if a compatibility issue comes up we have to act 
_doubly_ conservatively.
You think it's reasonable to not offer /proc/slabinfo? You can fairly 
assume that a user considers it absolutely unreasonable. If other kernel 
developers tell you: "no, it's fine", then it's as if other foxes told 
you "no, it's fine to eat that hen, we do it all the time too!" ;-)

certainly. But consider this from the user's perspective who tries one 
of our devel kernels. He suspects a memory leak. Runs slabtop and 
gets:
 $ slabtop
 fopen /proc/slabinfo: No such file or directory
and would fairly conclude: "ok, this new Linux kernel looks quite 
apparently unfinished, i'm outta here".
We do this way too frequently and many silly details like this _do_ 
mount up.

Sure, we can argue about details that not all fields in /proc/slabinfo 
are relevant, and that slabtop should be a bit more careful, etc., but 
we've got what we've got because _we_ built the current code, so we 
might as well accept the consequences it brings. The most of the basic 
output of slabtop:
 Active / Total Objects (% used)    : 648754 / 747076 (86.8%)
 Active / Total Slabs (% used)      : 39394 / 39394 (100.0%)
 Active / Total Caches (% used)     : 103 / 143 (72.0%)
 Active / Total Size (% used)       : 138884.36K / 151075.96K (91.9%)
 Minimum / Average / Maximum Object : 0.01K / 0.20K / 128.00K
   OBJS ACTIVE  USE OBJ SIZE  SLABS OBJ/SLAB CACHE SIZE NAME
 261928 239808  91%    0.13K   9032       29     36128K dentry_cache

could be offered on SLUB too.
'top' isnt critical functionality either like udev, and the ABI does not 
only cover 'critical' functionality. A utility suddenly not working 
gives Linux a pretty amateurish feeling. Should we tell users/admins: 
"Hehe, gotcha! Didnt you know /proc/slabinfo was not an ABI? Poor sob. 
If you want your stuff to continue working, use Windows next time around 
or what. Sheesh, what do these people want!' ;-)
the rule is very simple: unless you have really, really, really, REALLY 
good reasons, just dont break stuff.
