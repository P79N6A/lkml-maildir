If by stable you mean "unchanging", of course not -
much development is still happening.
If however by stable you mean "does not crash",
it has been very stable here, with a few known
needed patches applied.  2.4.14 is stable for me
on all systems, but compaq smart controllers do
need a small patch - I am also running the low
latency and/or preempt patches with excellent
stability.
