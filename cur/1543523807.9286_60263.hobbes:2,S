The test shows that LEA should not be arbitrarily used for arithmetic on
an index register. It clearly shows that addition is faster.
It was written to demonstrate this. It demonstrates this. Alan assumed
that I didn't know what I was doing and declared the test invalid, while
it is so provably valid that that such an argument is absurd.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>
int main(void);
void dummy(int unused);
volatile int true;
void dummy(int unused)
{
  true = 0;
}
int main()
{
    long leal = 0;
    long addl = 0;
        printf("Testing...");
        fflush(stdout);
        (void)signal(SIGALRM, dummy);
        (void)alarm(1);
        true++;
        while(true)
        {
            __asm__ __volatile__(
            ".align 8\n"
	    "\tleal 2(%eax), %eax\n"   /* 10 leals */
	    "\tleal 2(%eax), %eax\n"
	    "\tleal 2(%eax), %eax\n"
	    "\tleal 2(%eax), %eax\n"
	    "\tleal 2(%eax), %eax\n"
	    "\tleal 2(%eax), %eax\n"
	    "\tleal 2(%eax), %eax\n"
	    "\tleal 2(%eax), %eax\n"
	    "\tleal 2(%eax), %eax\n"
	    "\tleal 2(%eax), %eax\n"
                       );
            leal++;
        }
        (void)signal(SIGALRM, dummy);
        (void)alarm(1);
        true++;
        while(true)
        {
            __asm__ __volatile__(
            ".align 8\n"
	    "\taddl $2, %eax\n"     /* 10 adds */
	    "\taddl $2, %eax\n"
	    "\taddl $2, %eax\n"
	    "\taddl $2, %eax\n"
	    "\taddl $2, %eax\n"
	    "\taddl $2, %eax\n"
	    "\taddl $2, %eax\n"
	    "\taddl $2, %eax\n"
	    "\taddl $2, %eax\n"
	    "\taddl $2, %eax\n"
                    );
            addl++;
        }
        printf("\nNr adds = %ld Nr leals = %ld\n", addl, leal);
        return 0;
}
Now, LEA generates an address. Address generation takes more time
than simple register operations. If you use LEA for math on a register,
and immediately use the result, your code stalls during this time.
This code was deliberately designed to show that. If, as is done in
the checksum_partial() routines, there are other things that can
be done while the address generation is occurring (in parallel), then
such hand-tweaked code can execute faster than using math on ths index
register.
Unfortunately, I see that much of the indexed address generation
done in new versions of the C compiler abitrarily use LEA, followed
immediately by the memory fetch using the newly generated address.
This will be slower than simple math to obtain the address.
