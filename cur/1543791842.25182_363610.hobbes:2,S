Hmm, isn't ->compat_ioctl called before the translation lookup? If so,
this code would return -EINVAL from tape_34xx_ioctl and result in never
entering the conversion for MTIO* at all.
The same problem seems to be in the other patches of this series, but
I could also be mistaken.
BTW, I now have a set of 25 patches that moves all handlers from
fs/compat_ioctl.c over to the respective drivers and subsystems,
but I'm not sure how to best test that.
I intend to at least give it a test run on my Opteron for the whatever
ioctls I normally use, but the rest is just guesswork. Christoph,
can you review those patches?
