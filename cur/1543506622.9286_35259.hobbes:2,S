Hi there,
in Documentation/initrd.txt I've found that these devices should exist
when the /linuxrc of an initial ramdisk is executed:
  /proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev
  /proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-name
  /proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-addrs
the first one I've found. The other two are not there and the tryal to
create them leads into an ENOENT.
I've activated NFS and NFSRoot, no NFS-Server, most of the other FS'es are
deactivated. (Minix is active for the initrd) Under Networking options
I've activated "IP kernel level autoconfiguration", after failure I've
tried "BOOTP" too, no effect.
How to activate these files or if deprecated what to use then? My
quite simple intention is to boot a ramdisk, let myself chose which rootfs
to use and then use it, for flexibility I _need_ NFS based root fs'es.
