I am writing a module, that will communicate with a device attached to the
serial port.
 How can I do that from inside a module, using the present uart driver?
I want to do something like finding and calling the read/write routine that
is called by the kernel when a process from user space accesses the
/dev/ttyS1.
The reason I want to do it this way is that I don't want my module to only
fit one uart.
