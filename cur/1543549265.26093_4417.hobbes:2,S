    OK, my guess is that we may need to do some tweaking to the Makefile.
The basic idea is that you need to probe for hosts in a specific order.
The reason for this is that some host adapters emulate other types of
hardware.  For example, some Buslogic cards emulate Adaptec 1542.
Typically in such cases you want the Buslogic driver to handle the card and
not the 1542 driver (mainly for performance reasons - Leonard would probably
have more to say about this).  There *may* be other instances where probing
for one type of card can screw up another type of card, but I haven't heard
of cases like this in some time now,
    There are a handful of others - the comments in the initializer in
hosts.c explain some of them.  I hope there are not others which people
failed to document.
    A second potential gotcha - for compiled in drivers, I think that
low-level drivers should be initialized prior to upper level drivers.  The
reason for this is that not all of the upper level drivers are capable of
resizing the arrays on the fly (disk and cdrom are the two exceptions).
Yes, cleaning this up is on the list of things to do (it got partly done for
2.4), but fixing this is a nasty problem that reaches it's bony fingers all
the way up into some of the filesystems (essentially those stupid arrays in
ll_rw_blk which are read without any type of spinlock protection).   The
CONFIG_SD_EXTRA_DEVS parameter is used to pre-allocate room in the arrays
for additional devices, so for systems with small numbers (< 40) of disks
things may just happen to work.
    For now, the trick should simply be to keep the upper level drivers at
the end of the list of objects to be linked in so the initializers run last.
Thus my gut tells me the correct link order should be:
    1) SCSI core.
    2) low-level drivers (in same order as specified in hosts.c).
    3) upper level drivers.
