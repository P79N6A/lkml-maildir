Steve Pink and other authors forgotten due to old age have this wonderful 
router design where one processor of a dual runs a BSD variant and the
other runs a dedicated _polling_ router in the L2 cache using a compressed
routing table. If the dedicated router can't figure out what to do with 
a message, it passes it to BSD.  No interrupts, no cache misses, no OS 
delays.  One of the nice things about this design is it is based on a
clear understanding that you can't get something for nothing: no OS
structuring technique is going to make TCP/IP code perform like 
raw ethernet packet code.
