Perhaps I confuse things with SVCDs, but the ISO part *should* actually be 
mountable as it could contain valid data. I remeber authorinhg such disks 
(ie, puttins some stuff into the ISO part), which worked nicely, ie. it plays 
fine in standalone and eg. in Windows I could also access data on the ISO fs.
PS: Could you please check your clock. My mailer gets confused as your mails 
seem to come 20 minutes from the future. ;-)
