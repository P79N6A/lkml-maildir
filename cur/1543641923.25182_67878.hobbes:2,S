I only speak (and even then not officially) for Exim's implementation,
which is "verify = sender/callout" in Exim 4. I will check to see what
caches may or may not apply. (I think Exim might not cache this, in which
case I'll try to get this caching onto the wish list.)
Anyway I think this kind of paranoia is just silly. It's trivial to forge 
a valid sender address, so why bother checking anything other than a 
syntactically valid domain name?

These may well be Exim.

In Exim's case the network traffic will be minimal:
EHLO host.name
MAIL FROM:<>
RCPT TO:<sender@for.verify>
RSET
..is about as much as you'll get. The wasted cycles will be more 
important.
Sorry for the noise on the list..
