A bus is not something with expansion slots. Your machine has an ISA bus, or 
LPC rather, if only to hang its BIOS of. That earlier report about BIOS 
chips shitting themselves due to aborts on LPC together with ACPI involving 
the BIOS sounds a bit suspicious (and in that case using 0xed shouldn't help 
any).
