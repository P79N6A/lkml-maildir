I was once told the key to the 'magic' partition 4 on the partition
table of zip and jaz disks is that it corresponds to the Data
partition on a Mac.  Just a little insight..

Zip disks have partition tables.  When you buy the disks they
are usually
set up to have 1 partition which is partition number 4.  You
can use fdisk
to partition it however you want to.  There is nothing that forces
it to
be partition number 4.  Do an:
fdisk /dev/sda
and see whats there.
