You should not be looking at PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE at all. That is set by 
the BIOS and applies only for XT-PIC interrupt routing, not for IOAPIC. 
It is not necessarily relevant to the interrupt numbers used by Linux at 
all.

You should only be using the interrupt which is listed in the irq member 
of the struct pci_dev for your device. Likely if you do that your 
problems will go away.
