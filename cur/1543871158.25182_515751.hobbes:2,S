Never mind whether anyone read your patches three years ago,
it's disturbing when one body of active developers perceives an object
as shared and another (largely disjoint) body of active developers
perceives it as private: great scope for disaster.

Believe it or not, I had just about grasped that subtlety.  I was
rather expecting some helpful response along the lines of "we share
all the vmas across a fork" or "whenever we go to allocate a vma, we
look to see if there's already an isomorphic vma which we can share"
or something like that.  But don't worry about it, the source is
there for me to look at whenever.

That's reassuring, thanks.

No, it doesn't really make me any happier: I expect that if I look any
deeper, I'll just find plenty more to worry about there.  I have the
impression, now reinforced by your defensive posture, that NOMMU is
a hack that squeamish outsiders had better not look too deeply into:
so long as it mostly works for those who need it to work,
we'd probably just be wasting your time anyway.
