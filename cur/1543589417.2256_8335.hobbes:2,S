	Yes, and they're probably all bugs that were biting us
sporadically before.  We should take the opportunity to squash them
while they're out in the open.
	We'd better squash those bugs quickly too, because Peter
Osterlund has produced a patch that runs the child first without
giving all of the CPU allocation to the child, and this apparently
is enough to eliminate the problems people have been seeing while
retaining the benefit of running the child first.  So, I imagine
2.4.5 will not expose these problems.
	Peter emailed his patch to linux-kernel, but, for some reason, I
have only seen the copy that was cc'ed directly to me.  I have tried his
patch and added two lines so that the child is still run first even
when current->counter == 0 (stealing some CPU allocation to do so).
I have not benchmarked it, but I do know from testing that without
my addition, the parent would still run first about a 1/4-1/5th of
the time (consistent with the Linux's allocation of 5 ticks to a
regular priority process), and, with this patch, that reduces to about
1/30th.  If the performance benefit of running the child first is
noticible on bencharks, it should be worth doing it the other 20%
of the time as well.  Anyhow, here is my modification of Peter Osterlund's
patch, against 2.4.4:
