I don't know if you're the only one, but certainly not all people with
the hoontech's have this problem, even with SMP systems. I have a
Hoontech 4D-NX and a Tropez+, and my MIDI response and functionality
is as good as any MIDI hardware makes possible. I lose no events, even
in the face of a lot of MIDI data transmission (e.g. a MIDI fader box
being actively manipulated at the same time as a MIDI h/w sequencer
and an external synth that sends active sense bytes every few msecs).
You may have a bigger potential problem right now in terms of quoting
irrelevant messages in their entirety and sending MIME-based mail to
various email lists which have a majority of members who don't like
it.
