So you CAN NOT just blindly put a kobject (meaning a class_device)
structure inside of there.

No, just have the video drivers have a release callback to do the
freeing.  It's pretty simple, look at usb_host_release() in
drivers/usb/core/hcd.c.  That's exactly what that is for.  Hm, I
shouldn't have to check for bus->release() there, as release is now
required...

Ick, no.  Try doing what I did for usb hosts, it's much simpler.

genhd.c uses "raw" kobjects.  It might be easier to look at a
class_device example like the above mentioned usb_host one.
If you have any other questions/problems, feel free to ask.
