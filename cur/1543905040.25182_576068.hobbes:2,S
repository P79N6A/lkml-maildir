Greetings all;
A net friend of mine has a Gateway m305CRV laptop, with this radio in it:
Bus 003 Device 003: ID 050d:705c Belkin Components
Its apparently sitting on the usb bus, and from my grepping of the kernel 
srcs, it looks as if the zd1211b driver might be the correct one:
drivers/net/wireless/zd1211rw/zd_usb.c: /* ZD1211B */
drivers/net/wireless/zd1211rw/zd_usb.c: { USB_DEVICE(0x0ace, 
0x1215), .driver_info = DEVICE_ZD1211B },
drivers/net/wireless/zd1211rw/zd_usb.c: { USB_DEVICE(0x157e, 
0x300d), .driver_info = DEVICE_ZD1211B },
drivers/net/wireless/zd1211rw/zd_usb.c: { USB_DEVICE(0x079b, 
0x0062), .driver_info = DEVICE_ZD1211B },
drivers/net/wireless/zd1211rw/zd_usb.c: { USB_DEVICE(0x1582, 
0x6003), .driver_info = DEVICE_ZD1211B },
drivers/net/wireless/zd1211rw/zd_usb.c: { USB_DEVICE(0x050d, 
0x705c), .driver_info = DEVICE_ZD1211B },
This last one is the right set of numbers.  However, I'll be dipped but I 
can't find anyplace in a make xconfig in the 2.6.22.1-rt9 tree, to turn on 
the building of that driver.
Am I blind, don't know how to run grep, or does the xconfig script need more 
tlc?
Can somebody toss me a bone of info here?
Thanks everybody.
