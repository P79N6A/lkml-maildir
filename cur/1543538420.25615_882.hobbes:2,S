 It's a pair of 8259As, just like in PC/AT.  The only difference is they
are always programmed to the level-triggered mode, i.e. the LTIM bit of
ICW1 is forced to "1" by glue logic.
 The IRQ 12 output of the keyboard controller should get deasserted as
soon as data is read (just like IRQ 1 does).  Beware of a delay, though,
due to the limited speed of the controller.
