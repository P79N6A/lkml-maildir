ah!  now that makes sense.
So, I'm guessing the DS register is used by default to select the base
address for all non-stack oriented operations.  And I bet the SS
register is used by default for stack oriented operations, and all ops
that act on %esp (and %ebp?).  I think that make my life easier.
Thanks a lot!
