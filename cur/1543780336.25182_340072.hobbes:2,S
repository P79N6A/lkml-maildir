I understand.  I would love to drop this feature if it's supported in
the kernel generically.

It also has a similar check for vmalloc(), but it's less important
than kmalloc() (also for vmalloc, it doesn't nice since it breaks the
size and the alignment).

Yep, this would be nice to have.  The memory leak detection per module
(or subsystem) helped us many times indeed.
