I think all you want to do is when oprofile finds the cached_info
already existing, it does a kref_get(). After all it doesn't have a
reference to it, so before it starts using it it must inc the ref count.

There is a mechanism for that, you just have each cached_info inc the
module's refcount.
Another option would be to have a mapping, in the oprofile code, from
spu_contexts to cached_infos, ie. a hash table or something.
