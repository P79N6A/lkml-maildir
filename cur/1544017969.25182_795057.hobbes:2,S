The linux/Documentation/PCI/MSI-HOWTO.txt information is rather explicit
about it, and the pci core code does seem to expect it.

The devres code takes care of the free_irq() normally,
but does not do the pci_disable_msi(), because it doesn't
know enough about the device to do it right now.

Those calls to pci_intx() are definitely redundant,
as the pci core already does that for us on the relevant paths.

I still think the documentation matches the code in the pci core, though.
Patch for sata_mv coming shortly.
