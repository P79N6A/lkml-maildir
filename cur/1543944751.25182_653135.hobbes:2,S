Yeah, and that would require the modes and flags to be split apart in 
sys_set_mempolicy() and sys_mbind() or at least in do_set_mempolicy() or 
do_mbind().  So if we see the possibility that we want to test for mode 
and flag combinations that perhaps differ between the set_mempolicy() and 
mbind() case, we have to do it in either of those two places.  I think we 
should do it there, as early as possible, like I did in my first patchset.

I agree, I think keeping all of these implementation details inside 
mm/mempolicy.c is the best practice.  We'll still need to expose some of 
the details, such as the parsing of '=static' in the tmpfs mount option to 
add the MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES flag to the policy, but situations like that 
should be rare.
For extendability, I agree that the struct shmem_sb_info member should be 
a pointer to a mempolicy and not an int.
