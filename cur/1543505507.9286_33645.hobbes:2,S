Have you tried the following:
#setup
losetup -e rc6 /dev/loop0 /dev/cdrom
mke2fs /dev/loop0
losetup -d /dev/loop0
#mounting
mount -t ext2 /dev/cdrom /mnt/crypto-cd -o loop,encryption=rc6
or did you something different?

You don't need to :-)
patch-int-2.2.10-4 applies fairly cleanly to 2.2.11. Just on reject for
loop.c that can be most easily done by hand (just remove the lines
marked with '-' in drivers/block/loop.c.rej and add lines marked with
'+' to loop.c)
