Hello
Please personally CC my email address to any responses:
  mamiling@syr.edu
I am currently running a dual Pentium 4 Xeon 2.4 GHz system containing Red Hat 
Linux 6.2 with the 2.4.20 kernel.  The Pentium 4 Xeons report 4 cpu's to 
/proc/cpuinfo because they are hyperthreaded.
My problem lies in trying to measure the CPU usage with such programs as top 
or gtop.  Typically, I see CPU loads in excess of 100% when I run top with 
some of my signal processing applications, but not more than 200%.  Is this 
value out of 100%, 200%, or 400%?  How does this dual, HT system kernel report 
this info to the OS?
Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks
Matt
