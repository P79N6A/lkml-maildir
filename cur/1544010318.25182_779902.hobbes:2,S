And if you want to be absolutly sure.
RAM is cheap nowadays, plug in enough RAM (no swap!) so you can copy the 
image to burn into a tmpfs before starting to write them.
No disc IO involved at all. ;-)
A Single-layer DVD has a maximum of around 4.4GB so if you plugging in 
8GB, you are on the safe side.
Only for a Dual-Layer DVD you would need more RAM.
