2.6 scans less than 2.4 before declaring oom.  I looked at the 2.4
implementation and thought "whoa, that's crazy - let's reduce it and see
who complains".  My three-year-old memory tells me it was reduced by 2x to
3x.
We need to find testcases (dammit) and do the analysis.  It could be that
we're simply not scanning far enough.
