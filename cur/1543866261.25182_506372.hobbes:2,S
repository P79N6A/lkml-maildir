Well this is all a lot of speculation. This is not standard way of retrieving
information from ELF. Number of program headers finally created keep on
changing. Previously it was left to the linker and now people have changed
it to 3 by specifically using PHDR directive.

As long as one can make sure that test kernel boots (commonly the case with
distros), same kernel can be used as capture kernel too. So the idea here
is to be able to use same kernel binary as production kernel and capture
kernel hence distros don't have to ship an additional kernel binary compiled
for a different physical addr just for dump capturing purposes.
Currently relocation information is extracted from vmlinux and packed in
final bzImage after some processing. After execution of real mode code
and once the image is decompressed, all the relocations are performed and
then control is transferred to kernel.
