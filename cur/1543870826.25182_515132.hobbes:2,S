I'm not sure if that was intentional, but the second patch does not apply
on top of the -mm kernel but rather patch the the patch old itself.
This basically makes it impossible to review just that part, so better
provide the diff between the kernel with the old patch and the kernel
with the new patch next time.
OTOH, from what I could see from the contents, the changes themselves
look pretty good, I'd probably add my 'Acked-by' if I could read that
patch more easily ;-)
