It could be a different issue.  I tried 2.6.26, 2.6.25 and 2.6.24
and they all hang (they all worked fine with Fedora 9)...
I will try some older kernels but I start thinking that the xorg's ati
driver update is the main cause (xorg-x11-drv-ati-6.8.0-19.fc9.i386.rpm
-> xorg-x11-drv-ati-6.9.0-54.fc10.i386.rpm).
Thanks,
