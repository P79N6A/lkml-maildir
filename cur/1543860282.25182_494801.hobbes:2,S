As already said:
- merges infrastructure without any users (the corresponding x86_64 code
  is now merged and bloating the kernel unused for nearly one year)
- the planned user (perfmon) doesn't use the EXPORT_SYMBOL's that will
  bloat the kernel even if the code using this infrastructure will ever
  be merged
Let's either get the user into -mm, too, or drop the
infrastructure on all architectures until it's actually used.
