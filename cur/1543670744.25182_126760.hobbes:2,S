I do not really see why because 2.4.20 -> 2.4.21 contains already such a 
driver change. Note that I mailed alan and justin on pre4-acxx. Justin 
suggested various fixes that did not resolve the problem and then 
decided to do a code inspection. Reading the Changelog, indeed the 
locking startegy has changed compared to the rc1 version. I mailed 
arcello again on pre7 even providing kdbg backtrace.
Never mind : the report is more informative to others as I already 
patched my kernel to the last version...
Thanks for responding, and providing integrated patch sets.
Have a good day.
