Hi Richard,
Although your comment had nothing to do with my question -- I still
would like to point out that:
a) the driver in question (/dev/cpu/micocode) deals with module accounting
correctly by using THIS_MODULE in the fops, it doesn't use
MOD_INC/DEC_USE_COUNT macros
b) No, those macros should NOT be defined to do nothing because the Linux
kernel is a lot more than just set of drivers. There are subsystems that
still need them.
Regards,
Tigran
