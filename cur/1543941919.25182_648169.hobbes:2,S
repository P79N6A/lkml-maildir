Subject: [PATCH 2/2] ocfs2: Move /sys/o2cb to /sys/fs/o2cb
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/4/267

/sys/fs is where we really want file system specific sysfs objects.
Ocfs2-tools has been updated to look in /sys/fs/o2cb. We can maintain
backwards compatibility with old ocfs2-tools by using a sysfs symlink. After
some time (2 years), the symlink can be safely removed. This patch also adds
documentation to make it easier for people to figure out what /sys/fs/o2cb
is used for.

+Description:	This is a symlink: /sys/o2cb to /sys/fs/o2cb. The symlink will
+		be removed when new versions of ocfs2-tools which know to look
+		in /sys/fs/o2cb are sufficiently prevalent. Don't code new
+		software to look here, it should try /sys/fs/o2cb instead.
+		See Documentation/ABI/stable/o2cb for more information on usage.
+Users:		ocfs2-tools. It's sufficient to mail proposed changes to

+Date:		Dec 2005
+KernelVersion:	2.6.16
+Contact:	ocfs2-devel@oss.oracle.com
+Description:	Ocfs2-tools looks at 'interface-revision' for versioning
+		information. Each logmask/ file controls a set of debug prints
+		and can be written into with the strings "allow", "deny", or
+		"off". Reading the file returns the current state.
