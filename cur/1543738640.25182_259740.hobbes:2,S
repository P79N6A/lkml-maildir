In the short term, can't we just disable readahead for O_NONBLOCK?  That
has true non-blocking semantics --- if the data is already available we
return it, but if not, it's up to somebody else to retrieve it.
That's exactly what you want if you're genuinely trying to avoid
blocking at all costs on a really hot event loop, and the semantics seem
to make sense to me.  It's not that different from the networking case
where no amount of read() on a non-blocking fd will get you more data
unless there's another process somewhere filling the stream.
