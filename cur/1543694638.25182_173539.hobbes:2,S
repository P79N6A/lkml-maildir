And as has been addressed on this list before:
3) If the additional I/O traffic of the RAID can be kept off
of the system busses the overall system throughput goes up.
Once the CPU reaches a certain level of performance it is
the I/O and memory that limit things.  Do you really want to
pollute L1 cache with RAID-5?  When the $400 RAID server
card can saturate the PCI buss it doesn't matter how much
spare CPU you have, SW RAID will not be able to match the
performance.
