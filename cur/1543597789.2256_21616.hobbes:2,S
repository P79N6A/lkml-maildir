OK, here come two patches. The first one removes the special PSAUX reconnect
handling completely. So userspace should handle it. (Which is possible; just
not implemented in gpm/X11 at this time AFAIK.)
Second patch reintroduces the special handling again, but does
* react on AA 00 instead of just AA, thus much less likely breaking other
  drivers (such as synps2). All PS/2 mouses I could access (about 5
  different models) produced AA 00, so this seems OK.
* is disabled by default, and needs to be enabled by the psaux-reconnect
  boot parameter, like in 2.2.19.
Second patch depends on first. Please apply just the first or both.
(Current failure of gpm/X11 would make me choose for both, but then I'm 
 more the one thinking of customers of a distro than the one trying to keep
 the kernel clean. On the long term, I'd drop the second in any case.)
