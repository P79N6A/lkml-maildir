A feature of the new kernels that I really liked was the (feature?) in 
2.2.0pre5. The feature spelled out the full name of the kernel when a 
call was made to the kernel's internal data.
Is this possible to impliment (reimplement) in the further kernels as a 
standard thing or as an option. I think it comes in really handy to 
notice if for example I have not powered on the system in a while and I 
wish to know *exactly* what the kernel version and patch level is to 
minimize any confusion.
