The nature of a petition is that it's a request.  We (obviously) can't
force the kernel maintainers not to use BitKeeper, and I personally
wouldn't if I could.
So, the kernel maintainers can ignore the petition if they want to.  The
whole point of the petition is to let them know that there are people
who aren't happy with their choices.
