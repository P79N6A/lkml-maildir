Subject: headsup: [drm] in -mm tree at the moment..

The DRM that is currently in the -mm tree is an attempt to use proper
Linux PCI device handling, the code is from the DRM CVS where it has lived
for about 3 months, it fallsback to the old style probing if the
framebuffer is loaded for the card,
If anyone has any issues that they haven't seen before particularly people
with multiple DRI supported cards, or multi-head DRI supported cards, let
me know...
It won't be pushed to Linus for a while until I'm happy with it ...
Dave.
