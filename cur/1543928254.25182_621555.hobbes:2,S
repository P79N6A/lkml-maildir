I think I'll duck this lot for now in view of the (relatively small) amount
of followup.
I did do an experimental will-it-apply and got a tremendous number of
rejects against the x86 git tree, almost all of which went away when `patch
-l' was used.  Seems that someone has gone on a whitespace rampage through
arch/x86/ia32/ptrace32.c and arch/x86/ia32/ptrace64.c.
That's kinda/sorta OK, but `patch -l' is a bit more inclined to misplace
hunks and it's all a bit risky.
