Hmmm, that looks awfully similar to the problem other folks are
chasing (see thread "Possible dcache BUG").  Is it reproducible
for you by any chance?
There have been some debugging patches that Marcelo posted in that
thread, would be a good idea to try those out; although with your
crash its difficult to see which slab it is thats corrupted (iirc,
Marcelo's patch was targetting the buffer_head slab).
