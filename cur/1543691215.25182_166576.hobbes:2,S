I have an old Genius Colorpage-SP2 SCSI scanner.
It is shipped with a MS-PNR 8bit ISA non-pnp proprietary SCSI
card from Microtek.
Although its chipset is a NCR53c400a, it wouldn't work with the
appropriate driver, always accusing timeout, whatever settings
I passed to it.
Today I messed a little with the NCR5380.c file in drivers/scsi
which is included by the g_NCR5380 driver and I couldn't understand
one thing:
Why the function NCR5380_poll_politely() returned the value 'r'
on success if this value should be '0' case everything went ok...
So I changed "return r;" to "return 0;" and after that my
scanner worked fine, and was easily detected by SANE, without
a single error message.  :)
I have not the time to delve into the problem further, but I
wanted to report this. I couldn't find any counter-effects caused
by changing these return values.
