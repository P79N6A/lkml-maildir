Hello everyone!
I've got this problem from a while, and maybe this time I've nailed a portion 
of it; here goes:
I'm running Gentoo Linux, latest stable gentoo-sources (2.6.20-r8). I'm having 
random freezes of the system, including no mouse or keyboard interaction 
(SysRq not working), all accompanied by a stable-on HD activity led; HD seems 
not to work though, and X activity remains frozen; the only alternative is to 
hard reset.
Changed memory timing in bios, swapped memory, changed SMART, changed sata 
cables and ports; no avail.
/var/log/messages shows no unusual activity, so there's not an oops or other 
significant message before freezing.
This last time the system froze only for the libata part, leaving me keyboard 
mouse X and other HD activity stable; dmesg showed the following:

SCSI device sdb: write cache: enabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support 
DPO or FUA
I noticed NCQ is not enabled on that device, and trying to echo 31 to 
queue_depth initially gives permission denied; chmod root to rw, then echo 31 
to queue_depth gives input/output error.
I don't know if this is relevant to the total freezes, and haven't been able 
to find correspondence between ata devices and /dev/sdx ; if I can give you 
any more info, I'll be glad to.
Meanwhile:
lspci -v to the relevant devices:
