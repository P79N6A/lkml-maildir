Hi, I've been using e100 for years with no problem, however more by 
curiosity than necessity I'd like to know how will be handled the 
devices which are (supposedly) supported by eepro100 and not by e100?
According to "modinfo eepro100" and "modinfo e100" those devices IDs are 
only matched by eepro100:
+alias:          pci:v00008086d00001035sv
+alias:          pci:v00008086d00001036sv
+alias:          pci:v00008086d00001037sv
+alias:          pci:v00008086d00001227sv
+alias:          pci:v00008086d00005200sv
+alias:          pci:v00008086d00005201sv
Are they matched by some joker rule that I haven't noticed in e100, or 
is support for them really going to disappear?
See you,
Eric
