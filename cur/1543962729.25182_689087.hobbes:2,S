You might want to wait a bit more and pick a version which will end up
in either SLES or RHEL. These tend to be maintained for longer than the
other versions. For example SLES10 is based on kernel 2.6.16, which is
still maintained by Adrian (or at least was maintained for a long time
- I don't know what the current status is.)
