From what I've seen the major impact comes from the disk IO bandwidth to
memory size ratio and from the PCI bus to memory bandwidth.
I agree that comparing different hardware architectures is a tricky business,
but you asked me to comment on some of the comparisons that you made...

Oh, the docs don't mention anything of that... I'll try to set the docroot as

I'll release the source for the SPEC dynamic code dll, which indeed is just a
straight porting of the TUX dynamic code from the SPEC site.
