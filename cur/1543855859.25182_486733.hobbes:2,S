What about simply turning off CONFIG_PREEMPT to fix this "problem"?
We always properly run the backlog (by doing a release_sock()) before
going to sleep otherwise except for the specific case of taking a page
fault during the copy to userspace.  It is only CONFIG_PREEMPT that
can cause this situation to occur in other circumstances as far as I
can see.
We could also pepper tcp_recvmsg() with some very carefully placed
preemption disable/enable calls to deal with this even with
CONFIG_PREEMPT enabled.
