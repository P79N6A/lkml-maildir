It seems we may end up handling spurious interrupts or interrupts coming

I am not referring to the LSC interrupt the driver itself generates in
e1000_open just before returning. The ICR is masked (ICR==0) after
executing the driver probe (e1000_probe), but when we enter e1000_open
the E1000_ICR_LSC bit will already be set, before the function even
starts executing. I also observed that when the link is active the line
  /* fire a link status change interrupt to start the watchdog */
  E1000_WRITE_REG(&adapter->hw, ICS, E1000_ICS_LSC);
is redundant because the E1000_ICS_LSC bit is already set. In fact, the
irq handler gets invoked twice in a row with the interrupt cause being a
link status change.

Is it not possible to prevent the device from generating interrupts until we call request_irq?
Thank you for your feedback!
