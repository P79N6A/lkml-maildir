Proposed patch does not modify "gotten/put" modules order.
elevator_attch() function dynamically fills 'kmalloced' memory by
elevator structure before patching.
This function  fills substructure after patching dynamically as well.
There is no reference count problem: we can return to old scheduler if
new one fails.
Both, old and new, schedulers are saved for the duration of the switch.
