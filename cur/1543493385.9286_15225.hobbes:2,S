`man depmod` first. The module cannot be installed unless depmod makes
a dependency list that is free from unresolved symbols. If you use symbols
in your module that are not already exported by the kernel. You will
have to modify /linux/kernel/ksyms.c and export them. Carefull, there
are reasons why there are only a few kernel symbols exported.
