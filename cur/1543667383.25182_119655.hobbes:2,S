I think you misunderstand my point:  there was a patch posted which 
fixes the ptrace issue.  If you want to fix your kernel, there are two 
options:  either you are capable enough apply that patch yourself, 
otherwise get a kernel update from a vendor.  Marcelo is under no 
obligation to provide hot-fix kernels...
As for Alan, his task was easier:  Guess how many patches are in 2.2.25? 
  One.  ;-)
