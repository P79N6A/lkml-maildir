I had 2.3.20 having filesystems for lunch here (P2, gcc-2.95.2,
binutils-2.9.5.0.16).  Later kernels usually crashed init(8) after a few
seconds. Now I'm running 2.3.25pre2, the problems seem to have dissapeared.
On my other machine (P, gcc-2.95.1, binutils-2.6.5.0.7) 2.3.20 works
fine. 2.3.24 hangs on boot... don't know about 2.3.25pre3 yet.
Just FYI.
