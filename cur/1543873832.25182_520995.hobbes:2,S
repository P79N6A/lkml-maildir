What flexibility?

Virtual mmap allows holes in the same way as page tables do. These 
structures were designed for sparseness. I really do not think we should 
rediscuss the material here that was discussed on linux-mm. The outcome of 
that was that we will introduce virtual memmap to reduce sparsemem 
overhead and to increase flexibility.
