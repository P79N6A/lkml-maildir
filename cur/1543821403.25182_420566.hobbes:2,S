I've not seen much of this if any at all, the various caches that are in
place for these lookups seem to function quite well; what we did see was
glibc's malloc implementation being mistuned resulting in far too many
mmaps than needed (which in turn leads to far too much page zeroing
which is the really expensive part. It's not the vma lookup that is
expensive, it's the page zeroing)
