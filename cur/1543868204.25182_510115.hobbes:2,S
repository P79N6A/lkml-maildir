I don't actually think that is what happening. The block errors tend to trail a
bit behind, so the errors you are seeing are probably the result of the queue
being flushed out as you remove the card. I don't see any mmc debug messages
that indicate that is trying to send more mmc requests.
You could add a printk to the queue thread in mmc_queue.c. That will allow you
to see exactly when it exits (which should be before mmc_remove_host() returns).
