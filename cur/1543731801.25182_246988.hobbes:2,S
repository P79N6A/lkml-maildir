I'm making some assumptions here based on information I could scrape up off the net.
IDENTIFY DEVICE Word 93 support has been mandatory at least since ATA-5.
ATA-5 did not have lba48 or > udma/66.
SATA->PATA bridge boards support > udma/33 and thus must emulate an 80 conductor cable.
Thus, any device capable of lba48 (and these are the ones that trigger the > 200 sector problem) 
must (according to the ATA-5 and up standard) support correct use of the IDENTIFY DEVICE word 93 
register.
Given that the SATA->PATA bridge boards support 80 pin detection, then bit 13 of word 93 must be 
high on any drive that supports lba48, and given the *current* sata spec states that word 93 must be 
zero, we should be able to use this detection method.
Now, remember I have been an "ATA researcher" for about 4 hours now, please feel free to belt me 
with the wet salmon of enlightenment and point out the flaw in my logic. Otherwise, when I get home 
this evening I'm going to have a crack and getting this working.
Regards,
Brad
