1) 2.4 does have the failure modes you talk about ;)
2) I have most of an explicit load control algorithm ready,
   against an early 2.4 kernel, but porting it should be very
   little work
Just let me know if you're interested in my load control mechanism
and I'll send it to you.  Note that I never got the load control
_policy_ right yet ...

Rik
