You have got your answer........there is one, I have got it, but it will
not go into 2.2.0 due to more needed testing........the very thing you
are asking for is not stable yet..........Thus Linus will not take it.
I have about 250K of ide code that I consider stable, but will only make
it into 2.3.X due to the time crunch.
