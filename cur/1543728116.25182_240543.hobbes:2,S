Subject: [PATCH] Use posix headers in sumversion.c

When compiling Linux on Mac OSX I had trouble with scripts/sumversion.c.
It includes <netinet/in.h> to obtain to definitions of htonl and ntohl.
On Mac OSX these are found in <arpa/inet.h>. After checking the POSIX
specification it appears that this is the correct place to get
the definitons for these functions.
(

)
Using this header also appears to work on Linux (at least with
Glibc-2.3.2).
It seems clearer to me to go with the POSIX standard than implementing
#if __APPLE__ style macros, but if such an approach is preferred I can
supply patches for that instead.
A patch against 2.6.7 which change <netinet/in.h> -> <arpa/inet.h> is
attached.
Cheers,
Benno
