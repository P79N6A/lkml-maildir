Checking the disks periodically guards against another important
failure mode. Consider this scenario:
Start with a RAID1 mirror using two apparently working disks. 
The first disk develops a media fault, however, this goes unnoticed
because there happens to be no data stored on that part of the media.
Later, a fault is detected during a read of the second disk; the disk
is marked off off-line, but all the data is still readable on the
first disk so there's no need to panic yet.
You replace the known faulty disk with a new one. The md driver
automatically reconstructs the array from the first disk. Since the
md driver doesn't know about the filesystem, it reads every disk
block, regardless of whether it contains data or not.
The latent error on the first disk is now discovered, and the first
disk is now marked off-line. The replacement is only partially
reconstructed, so it remains inactive. Oops, there are no active disks
left - the md device has failed!
To guard against this, it is a good idea to periodically read all of
every disk in a RAID to detect faults early. Ideally, this should be
done as another background task, like reconstruction. Checking that
the data is valid is then a trivial extra step. If a read fails, you
mark the disk relevant disk off-line, as usual. If the parity check
fails, you just return a bad blocks list.
