Hi all,
   This is the ADI Blackfin patch for kernel 2.6.13.  I know this
patch doesn' meet the kernel patch submission format, but this patch
is only for reviewing, shows the changes we made.  And I'll send new
patch for kernel 2.6.14 for you to merge into kernel.
   This patch mainly includes the arch/bfinnommu architecture files
and some blackfin specific drivers.  The only change to the common
files is that we change binfmt.c and related header file, added one
flat binary format for blackfin. We are considering removing this
change in next release.
  The patch is too big to put here , url is
http://blackfin.uclinux.org/frs/download.php/570/bfinnonnu-linux-2.6.13.patch
  Thanks!
Luke
