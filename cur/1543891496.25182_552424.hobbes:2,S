What exactly do you consider broken?
I don't really see a way to change that at runtime since hard disk
partition tables are read at bootup. Or did you mean to change the
device where the partition table should be ignored at runtime, so one
could enable/disable it and reattach the device under the condition
that it's a removable device?
