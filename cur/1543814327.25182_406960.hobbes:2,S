This is a project at the University of Karlsruhe. The project web  
page is:
http://l4ka.org/projects/virtualization/afterburn/
and there you'll find documentation and source code. The source code  
supports our pre-virtualization project on L4 and Xen (and we have  
some nascent implementations for Linux-as-hypervisor and Windows-as- 
hypervisor).  We automate the transformations to the Linux code, thus  
minimizing the number of manual modifications. Due to the  
similarities of our approach and VMI, our virtualization runtime  
supports VMI with some minor additions.
