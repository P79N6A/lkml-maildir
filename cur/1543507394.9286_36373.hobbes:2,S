What does that really mean? MacOS is pretty good for multimedia
if that is all you want to do and you have simple multimedia.
Can you drive a robotic system, sampling sensors, driving a display,
operating a feedback control loop, and pulling data from a large
scale data base using Beos?  I doubt it. Beos offers low latency for
simple tasks, but DOS does that too.

I never see any published data on BeOS benchmarks so it's hard to evaluate.
But there are some obvious problems with the OS in terms of 
(A) hard rt response (none) (B) high speed networking (not) (C) high
bandwidth disk io ...

Specifics would be useful. We need a
multimedia component of lmbench.
