+9. Legacy I/O port free driver
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+On the large servers, I/O port resources could not be assigned to all
+PCI devices because it is limited (64KB on Intel Architecture[1]) and
+it would be fragmented (I/O base register of PCI-to-PCI bridge will
+usually be aligned to a 4KB boundary[2]). On such systems,
+pci_enable_device() and pci_request_regions() for those devices will
+fail because those functions try to enable all the regions. However,
+it is a problem for some PCI devices which provide both I/O port and
+MMIO interface because some of them can be handled without using I/O
+port interface. The reason why such devices provide I/O port interface
+is for compatibility to legacy OSs. So this kind of devices should
+work even if enough I/O port resources are not assigned. The "PCI
+Local Bus Specification Revision 3.0" also mentions about this topic
+(Please see p.44, "IMPLEMENTATION NOTE").
+
+This problem is solved by telling the kernel if your driver needs to
+use I/O port to handle the device. If your driver doesn't need any I/O
+port regions to handle the device, you can tell it to the kernel by
+setting the no_ioport flag in struct pci_dev. If the no_ioport flag is
+set, kernel will never touch I/O port regions for the corresponding
+devices. Please note that you need to set the no_ioport flag before
+calling pci_enable_device() and pci_request_regions().
+
+[1] Some systems support 64KB I/O port space per PCI segment.
+[2] Some PCI-to-PCI bridges support optional 1KB aligned I/O base.
