That's a lot of code to make a module impossible to install, and I think
it kind of misses the point.  Surely a non-hotplug "modprobe
blacklisted-module" should work?
If we define the first install to override included install commands,
and hotplug uses --config=<blacklistfile>, I think we have a better
solution.

I'm going to start bundling the testsuite with the source, to encourage
people to actually use it: it's not that hard...
