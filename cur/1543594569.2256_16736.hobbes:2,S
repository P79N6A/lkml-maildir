hehe, this one keeps the 3dmd from running here at all.

Well, I do not understand how the driver is distributed.
The actual 3ware stuff won't compile on 2.4.x, and the stuff in kernel
is always different from 3ware releases.
I use two 8-port cards (8 disks each) and I see different but
fatal problems on both systems.
Is anyone here using an actual firmware and raid-5 ?
Does it work up to some level on 6800 ?
Anyway, a useful proc-interface would be really cool
(like DAC); I guess that many people would love to get rid
of the - sorry - fucking closed sourced and totally broken 3dmd
which makes an extremly nice product totally useless (you can't
trust it; not only because it's closed source, it simply doesn't
work (except that it wastes memory, that works fine. tested.))
