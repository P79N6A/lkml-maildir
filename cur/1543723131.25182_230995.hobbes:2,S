Subject: [PATCH][PPC64] Fix memset
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch fixes a bug in the ppc64 memset where the code that gets
the destination address aligned (or is supposed to) was looking at the
bottom 3 bits of the count rather than the destination address.  The
result of this was that the kernel wouldn't boot on POWER3 machines.
The patch also removes an unnecessary duplicate instruction.
