This 5% is worthless:  it could be 0.1% as it could be 50%.  Without a
fair benchmark, you don't know.

Only for some metadata operations.

But people who scream for journalling don't just want a faster fsck, they want
an "instantaneous" fsck (at least:  mostly independent from the size of the
disk).  I'm not willing to lose 5% performance in order to win just a factor
2 for fsck (especially since my SCSI disk doesn't seem to suffer from the
slow unlink that seems to plague some IDE setups).
But if the slowdown is actually closer to 1%, I might be convinced.
That's why benchmarks are important.
