I thought it had been covered in other messages (with as big as this 
thread is I'm trying to avoid repeating the same thing more then a couple 
times a day :-)
there was another message talking about ways that you could reduce the 
image size without it being racy (allocate pinned memory until the 
remainder is small enough, then don't backup the pinned memory)
that's a much cleaner answer then what I was thinking, so I'll go with it 
instead ;-)
