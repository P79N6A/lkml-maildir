Hello.
1. Is there any benefit to enabling MTRR support for systems (RedHat v7.1 / 
kernel v2.4.9) that will never run a graphical user interface?  Usually I 
read of MTRR-related matters in the context of GUI acceleration.  Would my 
text-only system benefit from MTRR support?
2. The kernel doc says the DRM support is avalable for the Intel 440LX 
chipset, but no mention is made of the 440EX.  Given that the 440EX is 
kinda-sorta similar to the 440LX, can I assume that the EX chipset is also 
supported?
Please CC me as I am not subscribed to the list.
Thanks.
