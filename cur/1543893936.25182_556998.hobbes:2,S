Are you playing Linus' sheeple and parroting his lines just to make a
point, or are you like that all the time? ;-)

Don't worry, I'm not speaking even for FSFLA, and I'm entitled to my
own opinion.
I haven't consulted other FSFLA members about this.  This is all my
own personal opinion.
It just so happens that I'm very closely involved in the process, I've
spent a lot of time thinking about it, and I happen to share a similar
moral and ethical background with others involved in the process, so I
arrive at similar conclusions.
And then, I influence the process myself, so it's not like some of the
arguments I brought up here weren't taken into account while creating
the GPLv3, and adopted by its other proponents.
