Subject: Changed message for GPLONLY symbols

When insmod detects a non-GPL module with unresolved symbols it
currently says:
Note: modules without a GPL compatible license cannot use GPLONLY_ symbols
I thought that hint was self-explanatory, obviously it was not clear.
Never underestimate the ability of lusers to misread a message.  insmod
2.4.12 will say
Hint: You are trying to load a module without a GPL compatible license
      and it has unresolved symbols.  The module may be trying to access
      GPLONLY symbols but the problem is more likely to be a coding or
      user error.  Contact the module supplier for assistance.
Does anyone think that this message can be misunderstood by anybody
with the "intelligence" of the normal Windoze user?
