And they may work until someone changes something - like a CONFIG_*
name or directory structure.

I don't know what special flexibility are you thinking about.
DEPENDing on a symbol is as flexible and causes no such problems.
The user just needs to enable (in this case) WAN and HDLC
manually ((s)he has to select HDLC_* manually anyway). It could
even make SYNCLINK_*_HDLC unneeded, the added functionality could
(optionally) be selected automagically.
SELECTs are maybe good for small things but such inter-directory
ones are IMHO asking for trouble.
