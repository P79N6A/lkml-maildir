Hi,
    I'm totally new to this list... nice to meet you all. I don't know if it
will be of some use, or if you've already noticed it; I've downloaded and
compiled the kernel 2.3.99-pre3, and I get an error when I give
    make menuconfig
it says that I miss NCurses, but they are correctly installed on my system,
and infact the kernel 2.2.14 makes it correctly... make xconfig works just
fine, at least on MY own PC, but since I have to install linux on another PC
with a i810 graphic card, and I need agpgart to make X work, I cannot make
anything without menuconfig...
    Take care, and thanx for the GOOD work,
        Mano :)
PS: ah, yes... I have a Mandrake 7, with gcc 2.95.2, and RPMed NCurses 5, if
it means something... :))
