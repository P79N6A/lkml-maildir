The VP patches currently work on x86, x64, amd64, and ppc AFAIK.  As
stated in the docs, the MontaVista stuff is x86 only right now.
My tests show the worst case latency with the MontaVista patches is
about twice that of the VP patches.  Probably due to debug overhead and
a bug or two.  But, as expected, the average case latency is _much_
better.
Here's the top of the VP histogram, delay is in usecs:
