	Worse yet, some laptops are shipped with 15-heads setting and
backup/re{format|partition}/restore is not too pleasant option.

	IIRC one the laptop where I've seen that lossage BIOS geometry was
munged to ???*240*63.

Hmm... Laptop in question wasn't mine, so I'll just Cc the owner. Oleg,
could you give the model name of that sucker/give additional details?
Linux managed to boot with the unpatched ide-disk.c and mounted everything
OK, but fdisk was very unhappy until I did s/15/16/ in the function in
question. After that geometry was recoginzed and fdisk returned into sane
state.
So there... I don't have additional datapoints. I think that reasonable
course of actions would be to recognize 240 heads as valid munge and check
for this 0x3fff*15*63 bogosity, maybe informing happy owner about the
situation. But then I'm VFS/filesystems hacker, and underlying stuff is
*not* an area I'm comfortable with ;-)
