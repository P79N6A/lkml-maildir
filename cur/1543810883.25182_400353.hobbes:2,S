Here is the updated version of the patch, which changes
buffer_head.b_size to size_t to support mapping large
amount of disk blocks (for large IOs).
Thanks,
Badari
Increase the size of the buffer_head b_size field for 64 bit
platforms.  Update some old and moldy comments in and around
the structure as well.
The b_size increase allows us to perform larger mappings and
allocations for large I/O requests from userspace, which tie
in with other changes allowing the get_block_t() interface to
map multiple blocks at once.
