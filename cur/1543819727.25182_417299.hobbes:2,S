So, running with your "lazy unmounted" example for a bit.
The patch I proposed changes how d_path behaves when the task has chrooted 
relative to it's namespace.   So in your scenario what would calling d_path
on a dentry report (for !chrooted and chrooted) without this patch ?
I can't tell if you are claiming there is a fundamental problem calling d_path
*period* in this scenario. If so, I'd appreciate a little more concrete detail 
in the way of an actual example, this is a bit hand-wavy.
Or that you are just saying another version of "pathames are crap" which I'm 
not sure if appropos to this patch itself.
If it's the former, I'll happily go off and write some code to test your
assertion and it's ramifications if I can better understand what the actual
assertion is :-)
Thanks
Tony
