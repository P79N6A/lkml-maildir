If you need tmpfs the VFS layer is broken.  For 99% of everything
performance is determined by VFS layer caching.  A fs that
uses swap space as a backing store is not a big win.  You just have 
a fs that doesn't support sync and you can add a mount option to
a normal fs if you want that.
I've written the filesystem and it was a dumb idea.
Ramfs with (maybe) some basic limits has a place.  tmpfs is just
extra code to maintain.
