Could you please configure your editor to use tabs instead of spaces?
It would make the patch smaller and easier to read.

IMO it would be better to use a count, which limits to number of lookups
done with the spinlock held. This count could be put into nameidata, this
would change the prototype of cached_lookup/lookup_hash into using a
pointer to struct nameidata, but AFAICS it's not a really problem, as most
of the time the data is already available in a nameidata struct.
Since spinlocks are a dummy on UP, it would make sense to make this test a
inline function/macro, where it could be made a dummy as well.
bye, Roman
