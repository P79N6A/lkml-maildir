Ok.
The ac/battery status is used to guess the current brightness? Please
do not set suggested values automatically, IMO this is not a nice feature...
I am really looking forward to see a general /sys/../brightness.
Thanks a lot for working on this!
Just an idea for later:
Beside min/max there probably should be a /sys/../brightness_bat 
and /sys/../brightness_ac.
- If ac/battery brightness will not be set by kernel, userspace can write the
  right value to /sys/../brightness and the above two can be readonly.
- If ac/battery brightness will be set by kernel the above two should even be
  writeable so that people can avoid the need of pressing "brightness up"
  button without hacking the kernel.
I vote for letting userspace doing the stuff..., e.g. changing brightness behind
the back of some userspace tool will result in userspace tools starting to
poll.
