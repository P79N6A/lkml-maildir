The solution is simple:
The vendor or services provider submits his driver for inclusion into 
the kernel which is the best solution for everyone.

You didn't explicitely say whether the results of the contracted 
services you offer are free or non-free.
If the result is free, inclusion into the kernel is simply the optimal 
solution.
If the result is non-free, it;s kernel policy that there are no 
EXPORT_SYMBOL's specifically for non-free modules (and that a free 
module might some day use them is not a reason).
