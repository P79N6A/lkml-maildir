Yes, all the tools need to avoid /share.  Though at least it's a single
location we can avoid, and it is purely a system configuration issue,
whereas fixing deluser to watch for user mounts under /home involves (I
assume) rewriting a part of it.

The danger with relying on the pam module is that you have to plug it in
all the right places.  For instance, if we're talking about malicious
users, now we have to start worrying about an ftp daemon with user login
that isn't using pam, and happens to have an exploitable bug.
So it seems to me the per-mount flag you suggested really is the best
solution.  Now the pam module is still needed, but only to set things up
so that the user *can* do user mounts.  If there's a way to login
bypassing the pam module, then the user simply won't be able to do user
mounts anywhere but under /share, and as Miklos suggested the perms on
share can probably be set to 000.
