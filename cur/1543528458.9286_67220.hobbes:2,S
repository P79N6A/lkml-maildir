Sorry, non-kernel-related, but kernel related things are (occasionally)
being discussed on this thread.
Just to clear up some confusion: Linux works fine with DNS updates from
DHCP (using dynamic updates to bind).  Our whole network works this way.
Giving out DHCP leases with month durations makes a network pretty
indistinguishable from a static IP one.
On Debian Potato:
# apt-get install dhcp dhcp-dns
The days in which you had to have a static IP if someone wanted to ssh
to your machine are over.
