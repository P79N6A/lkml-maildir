Thanks for your answer. Since this board has linuxbios support and i plan to 
put it on this board, there has been a post which tells the right boot 
parameters:
apic=debug acpi_dbg_level=0xffffffff pci=noacpi,routeirq 
snd-hda-intel.enable_msi=1
I guess the "pci=noacpi,routeirq" makes the difference, but i haven't tried 
yet myself.
