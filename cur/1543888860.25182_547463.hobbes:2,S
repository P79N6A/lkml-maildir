You need to take into account that these features have been asked
about for years and we didn't respond. People interested in this have
turned to other solutions.
James Simmons maintained a multi-seat version of the 2.4 kernel for
years that had many happy users. I don't know the details about why it
never got merged. I believe two companies built special multi-head
video hardware for it (Appian and Matrox? it has been a while).
People needing Unicode console support can't speak English. How can
they complain on LKML? Linux is an OS for the world, we really should
make Unicode console work.
