Could anyone indicate to me the problems with PIIX controller support in
2.2.9 kernel, it appears to be lacking. PIIX controller Intel Chip set work
fine in 2.0.36, but I do not appear to see the support in the make
menuconfig areas. And all kernels detect the controller in 100% native mode,
which then breaks the use of hdc (atapi cdrom)
CC me personally any mail.. as I am not on this list.
Cheers
