We did the tests last month and used the stable version : vs2.0.2rc9 on a
2.6.15.4. Using benchmarks like dbench, tbench, lmbench, the vserver patch
has no impact, vserver overhead in a context is hardly measurable (<3%),
same results for a debian sarge running in a vserver.
It is pretty difficult to follow everyone patches. This makes the
comparisons difficult so we chose to normalize all the results with the
native kernel results. But in a way, this is good because the goal of these
tests isn't to compare technologies but to measure their overhead and
stability. And at the end, we don't care if openvz is faster than vserver,
we want containers in the linux kernel to be fast and stable, one day :)

I agree these are very different technologies but from a user point of
view, they provide a similar service. So, it is interesting to see what are
the drawbacks and the benefits of each solution. You want fault containment
and strict isolation, here's the price. You want performance, here's another.
Anyway, there's already enough focus on the virtual machines so we should
focus only on lightweight containers.

very interesting thanks.

we have these in the pipe also, we called them scalability test: trying to
run as much containers as possible and see how performance drops (when the
kernel survives the test :)
ok, now i guess we want to make some kind of test plan.
