I was going to ask about this - not being able to remount rw is a serious
problem because many users have only the root filesystem and this
limitation basically prevents this patch from being landable.
I'd suggest if the filesystem is going to be remounted read/write that
the journal mapping be discarded and the journal replayed.  Depending
on how you do the mapping it may be necessary to invalidate all of the
pages in the cache so that they don't reference the blocks in the journal.
Cheers, Andreas
