Being network device also has certain advantages since you can get direct
access to the driver through the packet interface. Implementing the
irdadump program (works like tcpdump) was very easy since I got almost
everything for free.
I guess that the issue of being char or net device is really about being
point-to-point or more like a multiple access MAC layer. IrDA is both and
can function in connected reliable, unconnected reliable, connected
unreliable, and unconnected unreliable mode. IrDA v2 known as AIR will also
support multipoint which is not that easy to put over the TTY abstraction.
Some people complain about the many and complicated layers of IrDA, so I
really don't understand why the same people wants to have the TTY subsystem
underneath ;-)

I have to run IrDA over 100 Mbps Ethernet until I get some VFIR equipment
(16Mbps), so I can test if the stack is working OK for such speeds as
well. Should be easy to write a small IrDA/Ethernet driver which wraps over
a the original Ethernet driver. Only need to set the frame type to IrDA, so
that the frames are delivered to the right handler. Haven't done it yet
tho'
