The problem with implementing this with a quirk is this line:
	res->end = limit + 0xfff;
That hard coded value of 0xfff is the problem.  I suppose I could make
it a variable and initialize it to 0xfff and then set it to 0x3ff in the
quirk.
I'll take a look at doing it that way (and try to fix my line wrap
problem).
Thanks,
Dan

Shouldn't this be made into a pci quirk somehow?

Your patch is linewrapped and can't be applied :(
