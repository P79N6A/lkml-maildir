You CC'd trivial@kernel.org, so you've probably read
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/bunk/trivial/
which clearly says that it most likely will go into 2.6.20(-rc1). So
your "git pull" tests tell nothing...
I have never submitted a patch to trivial@, so I have no idea if you get
any kind of confirmation that it will be included, but if you get none,
you should probably just assume that it will be included.
Also, you should just take David's reply as a confirmation that your
patch didn't get lost in the noise but was seen by someone. Of course
you should also remember to not re-submit patches that quick, especially
if there is only a weekend in between the two submissions...
