As Kumar has stated, people have tried to do this in the past.  Please
search the archives for the problems that will happen when you change
this.
I agree it should be fixed, but if you want to do this, you need to
audit a _lot_ of kernel code and fix it up everywhere.  Please start
with the old patches posted to lkml in the past and work from there.
good luck,
