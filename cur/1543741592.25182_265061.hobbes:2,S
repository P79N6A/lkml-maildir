it's very easy to explain it now that you spontanously used that concept
in 2.6: classzone is the piece of ram represented by what you previously
called alloc_type in 2.6.9 mainline alloc_pages function. You wrote that
code so you know what it means. If you prefer to still call that
alloc_type that's fine with me.
