Hi,
I have tried to set up quagga with tcp-md5 support from kernel. All seems ok
with a intel e100 NIC, but as i testetd with a intel e1000 NIC the tcp
packets have an invalid md5 digest.
If i run tcpdump on the mashine the packets are generated, it shows on the
outgoing interface invalid md5 digests.
Are there known issues about tcp-md5 and e1000 NICs?
Regards 
Marc
