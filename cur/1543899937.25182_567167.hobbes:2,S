Well, mkdumprd is RedHat specific. (We use the normal mkinitrd for
this.) 
Also, I don't want to rebuild the initrd of the kdump kernel just only
after changing the running kernel. That would require to rebuild the
initrd for the kdump kernel on *every* boot of a kernel that's another
version than the last booted kernel.
