Subject: [PATCH 0/6] IB/ehca: Assorted patches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here's a set of patches containing various improvements and bugfixes for the
IBM eHCA InfiniBand driver, bumping the version number to SVNEHCA_0023. The
patches are, in detail:
#1 - Serialize hypervisor calls in ehca_register_mr()
#2 - correctly set GRH mask bit in ehca_modify_qp()
#3 - Fix AQP0/1 QP number
#4 - remove _irqsave where it's not needed;
     move an #ifdef to where it makes even better sense
#5 - beautify sysfs attribute code and fix compiler warnings
#6 - disable scaling code by default and bump version number
The patches are ready for inclusion into 2.6.22 and apply on top of Roland's
git tree (which has been pulled by Linus recently, so they should apply there,
too).
Cheers,
  Joachim
