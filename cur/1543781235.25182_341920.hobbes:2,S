This should be diffable. You caught this regression relatively early.
But I'm afraid you have to go through the divide-by-half excercise.
If I were a betting man, I'd bet on this:

Remember that dmesg diff you sent? That's the one. If you strace
the digikamcameracl, it probably keels over after EBUSY.
