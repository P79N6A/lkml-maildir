Okay, now that I've realized my first idea is really dumb, I'd like to
confirm that DMA to an onboard/PCI device does actually work addressing
physical memory > 64MB.  Is this true?  I changed scsi_init_malloc() to
remove the GFP_DMA flag iff the first allocation w/GFP_DMA fails...it
seems to now work (but obviously it will blow up for ISA cards).  Is
GFP_DMA is used anywhere else other than to tell __get_free_pages() to
only allocate in areas < 64MB)?  I'm assuming this should be safe (for the
case of this one machine w/no ISA SCSI controllers) if not.
