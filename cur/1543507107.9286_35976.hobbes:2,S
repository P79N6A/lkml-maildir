Sounds like you're running into context switch time overhead, since
I've seen similar things when trying to sleep less than 10 ms on a
pentium 200 (i.e. you can't unless it's a busy sleep).  
Your test will probably fail no matter what you do.  I'd bet you'll
get a similar value if you do
time1=gettime() 
syscall()
syscall()
time2=gettime()
where syscall is some sort of syscall that requires little time to
complete ( like nanosleep for 1 nanosecond).  
How to improve this sort of depends on what you're trying to do.
