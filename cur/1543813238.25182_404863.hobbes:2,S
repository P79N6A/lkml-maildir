Just checked, yes prune_one_dentry() needs to be called once the parent
gets on to the LRU list, so we must call prune_dcache() again.
In -mm, the generic_shutdown_super() calls shrink_dcache_sb() which takes care
of looping till the lru-list is empty.
Your fix is correct, but the looping is probably not be required for -mm.
