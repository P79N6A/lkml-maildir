  We couldn't leave quota on when filesystem is remounted ro because we
need to modify quotafile when quota is being turned off. We could turn off
quotas when remounting read-only. As we turn them off during umount, it
probably makes sence to turn them off on remount-ro as well.

  Actually, I couldn't reproduce the hang on my testing machine so I don't
know exactly why it hangs. But my guess is that it's because we try to
write to the filesystem...
