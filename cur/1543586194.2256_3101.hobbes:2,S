This is all completely useless. Why not remove world rw permissions in the
first place. If the admin isn't even able to write a cron job that does
this, all help is lost.

Just as useless.

So? The virus will just redo the checksum. Sooner or later their will be a
routine to do this in libbfd and this all reduces to a single additional
line of code.

One sane way to do this is to store the sig on a ro medium and make the
kernel check the sig of every binary before it is run.
HOWEVER, this means no compilers will work, and you have to delete all
script languages like perl or python (or make all of them check the
signature).
Useless again, IMO.

Your best bet is to educate your users.
