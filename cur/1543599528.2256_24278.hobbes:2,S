   The patch below reserves an ioctl for getting the size in blocks of a
   device as a long long instead of long as the old ioctl did.  The patch for
   this to e2fsprogs sneaked in a bit too early.  There is a conflict with
   the ia64 get/set sector ioctls, but I that's less common than e2fsprogs.
Any problems with using "u64" or some other more strictly portable
type?  "long long" and other non-fixed sized types cause grief for
many dual-API platforms.
Later,
