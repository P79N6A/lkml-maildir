I had another closer look and it seems there are good chances to 
reconstruct the data in useable way (especially the rather recently 
added gnupatch and constant link should help). It's not my favourite 
solution, since it has to be pieced together from more parts than really 
necessary, but as proof of concept it should be interesting. So far I 
stayed away from this, because of the traffic this will cause and your 
previous disapproval of causing such traffic, but I can assure you I do my 
best to keep it to a minimum.

I'm still a little confused how this matches your earlier statement, if 
you had said this earlier, we could have cut the whole thing short and I 
could have avoided getting roasted by Linus.
Anyway, I don't really care and thanks for the offer, I certainly will 
come back to it (although not immediately).
bye, Roman
