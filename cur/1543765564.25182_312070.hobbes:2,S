/dev/urandom depends on the strength of the crypto primitives.
/dev/random does not.  All it needs is a good uniform hash.
Do a bit of reading on the subject of "unicity distance".
(And as for the endianness of the SHA-1, are you trying to imply
something?  Because it makes zero difference, and reduces the code
size and execution time.  Which is obviously a Good Thing.)
As for hacking Fortuna in, could you give a clear statement of what
you're trying to achieve?
Do you like:
- The neat name,
- The strong ciphers used in the pools, or
- The multi-pool reseeding strategy, or
- Something else?
If you're doing it just for hack value, or to learn how to write a
device driver or whatever, then fine.  But if you're proposing it as
a mainline patch, then could we discuss the technical goals?
I don't think anyone wants to draw and quarter *you*, but your
code is going to get some extremely critical examination.
