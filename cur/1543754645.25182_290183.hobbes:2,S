I do not feel qualified for a full review of this code. However, I
noticed the following minor issues:
> +config I2C_MV64XXX

0x170000 is reserved within the legacy i2c project for an USB algorithm,
and 0x180000 for virtual busses. Could you please use 0x190000 instead,
so as to avoid future collisions?

You have a tab instead of space before MV64XXX_I2C_CTLR_NAME, it seems.
Also, you want to align the numerical values using only tabs, no space.
