Thanks for the tip (it's good I got schedule_work right, it wasn't hard but 
1st time I use it), however the device is not later freed, it seems, in this 
context... even because it's an unlikely event (I reproduced it with a 
damn-bad configuration).
Not going to cause seeable leaks anyway, but yes, to correct.
However, network devices are created from the host only, so only the host 
should free them (as done by net_remove on "hot-unplug" request).
Maybe that's to fix too, however, but in a separate patch; Jeff, what about 
this?
