It's a microoptimisation - lru_add_drain() is always called with local irqs
enabled, so no need for irqsave.
I don't think spin_lock_irqsave() is notably more expensive than
spin_lock_irq() - the cost is in the irq disabling and in the atomic
operation.

Spose so.  If we cannot convince ourselves that local_irq_enable() in an
ipi handler is safe, we need to convert any called functions to use
irqsave.
