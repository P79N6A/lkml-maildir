Whenever an adapter reset is done (eg ifconfig up) on the same adapter
that SoL is using, you'll lose SoL.  SoL usually comes back, although
I've not had much luck ever since the Sun auto negotiation patch went
in.  One fix/workaround to not losing your SoL connection is having the
network go only over eth1 (assuming you have two switch modules).
Thanks,
Jake
