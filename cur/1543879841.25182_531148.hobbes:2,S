Actually there is now. I did something similar called subterfugue and
we solved this one.

You can't deny a system call, but you can turn it into getpid(), then
fake the return value. You probably could invent ptrace extensions,
like solaris did, to avoid context switches.

We got this solved in linux, I believe.

I think we actually have a flag for "kill this if tracer dies"... or
we could add it.

I'm not advocating it. I've done this before, see subterfugue.org. It
was a ugly hack, mostly because it was filename based. Unfortunately
AA is also filename-based.
