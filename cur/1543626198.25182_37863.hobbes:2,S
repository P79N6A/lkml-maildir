Yes, please do.
The more bug reports I can receive (in private or CC'd to lkml), the 
better picture I get.  If you have multiple tulips, feel free to email 
reports on those too :)
Best output is:
    lspci -vvvn
    dmesg, after updating drivers/net/tulip/tulip.h TULIP_DEBUG to 5, 
and recompiling
    tulip-diag -mmaavvveef
tulip-diag was written by Donald Becker, and is available from 
ftp://www.scyld.com/pub/diag/
  Compiling instructions are at the end of 
tulip-diag.c.  You should grab libmii.c as well.
    Jeff
