All ports under arch/powerpc are required to use a flat device tree  
to boot.  Look at Documentation/powerpc/booting-without-of.txt
  for details on how that is done.  Beyond that there isn't too much  
different from arch/ppc to arch/powerpc.  Take a look at the 83xx or  
85xx platforms for comparison examples between arch/ppc & arch/powerpc.
I'd suggest for working up your flat dev tree for the bridge on HPC2  
and post that to the linuxppc-dev list for review and then go from  
there.
