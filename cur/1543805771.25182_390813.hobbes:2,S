as far as I know, OpenZaurus 3.5.4 is comming soon, but the standard kernel is 
still 2.4.18-xyz. The Zaurus 5500 was not ported to newer kernels, because 
the implementation from sharp/lineo was just to ugly. Instead a direct 2.6 
port was started but not finished up to now (see 
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~lenz/zaurus
).
I don't know if netfilter is activated in the OpenZaurus kernels, but you can 
build a kernel yourself and activate it (see www.openzaurus.org and 
http://oe.handhelds.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/GettingStarted
 for the toolchain and 
buildsystem).
Pavel Machek has send some patches recently to lkml for the 2.6 kernel, but I 
don't know what the status is right now.
