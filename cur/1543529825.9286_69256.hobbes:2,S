I have two minor fixes I sent you in against 2.2.15pre13, they are still
pending for 2.2.15pre14, so I'm resending these.
They are:
1) fix drivers/char/Config.in so that the MSP3400 module can actually be
   configured (currently assumes MSP3400 is only found on BT848-style
   cards, if that's not sure, it needs changing)
2) fix compile date in kernel tag line to be of C locale rather than
   current user's locale (cosmetic, obviously correct).
Patches are attached below and can otherwise along with PGP-signed
MD5sum checks be found at:

Hi! I'm the infamous .signature virus!
Copy me into your ~/.signature to help me spread!
This is meant to allow for the MSP 3400 chip driver for v4l to be built.
To be applied against 2.2.15pre13
