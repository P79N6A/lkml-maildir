Sure. However, with this scenario, the amount of additional work would be
low, as the time-consuming things are done once for both trees.

Not sure about it - while I'm using 2.6.0test on my notebook (my personal
news/mail server + less important things), I also use official kernels
on some machines and patched trees on other ones.
What I _don't_ use is distribution kernel - not because it's bad, but
rather because i don't know it good enough.

-post, yes. But it only solves this one problem.
