Duh.  And here I was thinking that was a good thing.  That did it.  What exactly
does "Explicit Congestion Notification" do?  I figured it was going to put a
message in syslog if the wire is full and packets were being dropped.  There
weren't any docs in menuconfig - so I figured "what the hey?".  Boy - I was
wrong.  Thanks for the quick response.  I haven't even gotten the post back yet.
