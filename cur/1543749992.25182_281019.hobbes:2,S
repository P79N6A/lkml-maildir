I have no idea. But I can suggest, that in order to get meaningful
hints, you may want to mention exactly what kind of motherboards (and
bios levels) you're talking about, along with the top 50 lines of dmesg
output from both the 4 Gb and the 64 Gb kernel on the Tyan MB.
Nobody will know that 'a Tyan MB' is, unless it's the Illuminati and
you wouldn't want those on to you, right?
