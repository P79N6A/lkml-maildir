free bios hackers--
Johan Rydberg has kindly allowed me to posted his GPL's STPC BIOS
sources.  The code is early work and incomplete, but may be useful to
people here...
I have been hacking on this instead of OpenBIOS lately, as it seems
easier to use these stpc source to create a BIOS for the i430FX.

BIOS sources there too)
