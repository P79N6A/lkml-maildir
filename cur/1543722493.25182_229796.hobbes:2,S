Then it sounds like the smaller fix below may be better for you.

No, RHEL3. I'm not aware of any mm/oom_kill.c changes in any of the
Fedora snapshots.

During stress testing at Oracle to determine the maximum number of
clients 2.6 can service, it was discovered that the failure mode of
excessive numbers of clients was kernel deadlock. The following patch
removes the check if (nr_swap_pages > 0) from out_of_memory() as this
heuristic fails to detect memory exhaustion due to pinned allocations,
directly causing the aforementioned deadlock.
