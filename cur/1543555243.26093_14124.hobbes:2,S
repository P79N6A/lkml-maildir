Just like the first time after the kernel crashed, i pressed 
ctrl-alt-del, then another oops-message appeared.
After that i could only switch the system off. Reboot with the same result 
--> power off.
Switching on again (3rd time) --> system boots!!!
But again the kernel says at ide2, ide3 and ide4: Bios settings: hde:pio.
Now, when i boot next time the Bios settings will be dma again.
Best regards,
Oliver Poths
