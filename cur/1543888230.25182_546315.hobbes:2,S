While the BIOS can disable HT, the ability to *report* HT or the lack thereof is 
within the CPU itself.  I doubt my socket AM2 board has the faintest clue what 
HT is.
As for human-readable names, the model name in /proc/cpuinfo comes from the 
processor name string, and includes however much or little information the 
vendor thinks the lay user wants to know.  If you want more detail, you can 
always interpret the model, stepping, and other related fields to determine the 
model number.
If you don't want to manually look up model info on a CPU version table, x86info 
and dmidecode will give you more information.
