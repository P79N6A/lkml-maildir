I seriously doubt there would be a noticable power consumption or heat 
difference between two CPU's running HLT half the time, and one CPU running 
HLT all the time. And I'm downright certain it isn't worth the code 
complexity even if it was, there is very little (read: no) intersection 
between the SMP and low-power user base.
