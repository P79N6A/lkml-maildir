Adding a the idea of function here was proposed a while back and we
probably should do that but it needs to be a separate patch and some of
the other drivers probably need tweaking for consistency. I will take
care of this for the next merge window.

Hmm, there really is no way to just turn the LED on? :(

The Kconfig option shouldn't need to go into this much detail. If we
need this much detail, we should probably enhance the LED documentation
in Documentation/ instead.

Probably easiest to turn the two references to this into "return 0"
Other than that the driver looks ok and I'm happy to add a version with
the above minor tweaks to the LED tree.
