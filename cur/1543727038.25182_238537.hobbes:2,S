So what requirements have we collected so far?
  o device selection (presumably domain, bus, slot, function)
    i.e. select the device you'd like to manipulate
    ioctl?
  o per-domain & device VGA enable/disable
    need to disable VGA ports on cards in the same domain and/or bus
    ioctl?
  o legacy port I/O
    for properly routing I/O in multi-domain machines and machines where the
    kernel or firmware may need to trap master aborts
    read/write?
  o legacy memory mapping
    for mapping the legacy VGA framebuffer, may fail
    mmap?
Is that a complete list?  Of course, the interface mechanisms are up for 
debate too.  We might be able to do it with per-bus or per-domain files in 
sysfs for the legacy I/O and memory stuff, but that might not represent the 
fact that legacy devices have interdependencies very well (e.g. VGA ports 
must be disabled on device A before we poke device B, etc.).
Thanks,
Jesse
