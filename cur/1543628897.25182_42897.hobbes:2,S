Hi,
I've got some spare time to look at my all day problems / questions.
How far have the initramfs stuff got ? Is there any code yet ?
I have implementet some very very simple cpio image extraction in 
init/do_mounts.c and want to know if this could be usefull to somebody. 
Should it be possible to use initramfs without the ramdisk driver compiled in?
cu, Christian Koenig.
