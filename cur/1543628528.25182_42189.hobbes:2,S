Subject: File corruption when running VMware.

I have a repeatable problem when running VMware workstation 3.00 and
3.01.  The cause is still unknown, and could be VMware itself, the
hardware or the kernel.
When running VMware, a file read from disk can be corrupted and will
stay corrupted in memory in the disk cache.  It can be reproduced by
checking the md5sum of a large file (>200MB), with different results
each time when VMware is running.
Further tests shows the corruption occurs only at the 3rd byte of a
16-byte block, and only the LSB is affected.
Load on the machine is minimal and VMware is at the BIOS setup screen.
Has anyone encountered this problem before?  I can provide any
additional information that might be useful.
Cheers,
Hong-Gunn
