It depends on what you mean by "pure-BSD". If you're talking about the 
4-clause license with the advertising clause, then you are correct. Otherwise 
(IANAL) but my understanding is that BSD code can even be relicensed GPL by a 
third party contribution (though it is perhaps kind to ask for relicensing 
permission anyway).

Then would offering a 'stable API in disguise' not be a disaster and an 
irritation to these people? If the kernel doesn't specify that an in-kernel 
interface is stable, then there is no reason to expect it to be. It might not 
change, but there won't be too much sympathy for out-of-tree users if it 
does. The kernel comes with big warnings about the lack of a stable API for a 
reason.

If the driver is an old-tech Linux port, then it seems there isn't too much 
stopping them from doing this today (aside from the fact that some people 
think proprietary modules are murky anyway). In this case, we don't want a 
stable API/ABI, because then we leave them with little incentive to open the 
code.
And if the driver is new code, they're better off doing an open driver from 
the start (especially since writing a driver _for_ Linux, as opposed to 
porting one, might make it count as 'derived' and hence unlawful unless 
released GPL).

We're not as perfect as I wish we were. But the lack of stable API (dead 
horse) is something that is fairly well established and understood. I think 
most people feel that the cost-benefit analysis, for Linux anyway, strongly 
favors no stable API.
Thanks,
