Yes it gets regularly tested and works reliably on my test harware. I am
however using standards compliant hardware.

Do you have two cards here ?

This looks like you have both a CF adapter which does not properly handle
drive select, and a CFA card which incorrectly only allows a set
features/xfer mode to be done once.
The old IDE layer has a workaround to try and detect the former bug
(which sadly looks like it will be needed in libata), and through sheer
ignorance happens not to break in the second case.
Your card should work with the current -mm driver although not entirely
for the right reasons. Given you have such a marvellously buggy set of
hardware can I send you some test patches to try ?
