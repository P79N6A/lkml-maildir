This is a useful point, but doesn't address the intent of the original
proposal. The solution you propose gives VERY powerful capabilities to a
process, and if I undestand how it works gives them in every directory.
By putting them on a single directory like setgid, you allow any tool to
operate on files in the directory, given that the process has directory
access to do so. Think "groupware" and people working on a project.
Both are useful, of course, but they are NOT alternative solutions to the
same problem, but solutions to two problems.
