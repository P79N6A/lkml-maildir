Hey,
I've been trying to compile 2.4.3ac2 - ac4 and have had the same problem everytime.
It deals with pmac_pic.c (I sent this to Cort <cort@fsmlabs.com> as well)
As I never meddle with kernel source I'm sorta at a loss (hope to change this one day)
Error is as follows:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/2.4.3/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -D__powerpc__ -fsigned-char -msoft-float -pipe -ffixed-r2 -Wno-uninitialized -mmultiple -mstring    -c -o pmac_pic.o pmac_pic.c
In file included from /usr/src/2.4.3/include/linux/sched.h:9,
from pmac_pic.c:4:
/usr/src/2.4.3/include/linux/binfmts.h:45: warning: `struct mm_struct' declared inside parameter list
/usr/src/2.4.3/include/linux/binfmts.h:45: warning: its scope is only this definition or declaration, which is probably not what you want.
pmac_pic.c:47: parse error before `{'
make[1]: *** [pmac_pic.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/2.4.3/arch/ppc/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_arch/ppc/kernel] Error 2
I appreciate the help
