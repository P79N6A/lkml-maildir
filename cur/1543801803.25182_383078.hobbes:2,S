This is the usual chicken and egg problem:
Without a warning noone will fix the code.
And yes, some of the drivers affected seem to be maintained (and 
49 warnings come from OSS drivers with ALSA replacements another patch 
I sent removes from the kernel).
They might not show up in your all*config builds that set SMP=y, but the 
warnings with my patch aren't worse than the one's BROKEN_ON_SMP drivers 
are spitting.
