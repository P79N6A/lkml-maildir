You forgot "make oldconfig". When you copy in a .config file from a
different kernel, always do oldconfig (just get in the habbit, if the
.config from the same kernel it's harmless).

Compiling for a different CPU type will often change object file size,
but what you describe sounds extreme. I would have suspected something
along the lines of some debug options having been enabled - that would
more easily explain the large size difference.
