Well you need infinite memory for that :-)
But that is my point: Why go into the problem of storing absolute time 
when you can use relative time?

64 bit is also relative - just over a much longer period.
32 bit signed offset is relative - and you know it. But with 64 people 
think it is absolute and put in large values as Linus said above. With 32 
bit future developers will know it is relative and code for it. And they 
will get their corner cases tested, because the code soon will run 
into those corners.

I don't think those large values will be relavant. You can easily cut 
off sleep times at 30 min or even 1 min. But you need to detect that the 
task have indeed been sleeping 2^32+1 usec and not 1 usec. You can't do 
with a 32 bit timer alone. In that case you need to use a (at least) 64 bit
timer - which is needed in the OS anyways. But not internally in the
wait queue, where the repeated calculations are.
