4 times normal. You don't actually make the timer interrupt happen at 
250Hz, so the timer will be programmed to run at the full 1kHz.
You also need to actually change the LATCH define (in 
include/linux/jiffies.h) to take this into account (there might be 
something else too).
So 
	/* LATCH is used in the interval timer and ftape setup. */
	#define LATCH  ((CLOCK_TICK_RATE + HZ/2) / HZ)  /* For divider */
should become something like
	/* LATCH is used in the interval timer and ftape setup. */
	#define LATCH  ((CLOCK_TICK_RATE*jiffies_increment + HZ/2) / HZ)  /* For divider */
and you might be getting closer.
Of course, you need to make sure that LATCH is used only after 
jiffies_increment is set up. See "setup_pit_timer(void)" in
arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_pit.c for more details.
