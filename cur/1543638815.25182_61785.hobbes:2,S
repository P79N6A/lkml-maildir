01-relocation-4 deals with allowing reiserfs to use an external logging
device.  It isn't related to your problem, but 02-commit_super-8 is
diffed against it.
02-commit_super-8 does two things.  First it changes sync_supers() so
that it won't loop on a single filesystem while it's super is dirty. 
Before, if kupdate triggered a write_super call, and another FS writer
redirtied the super after write_super cleared it (but before it
returned), write_super gets called a second time.  Since a commit was
done for each write_super call, that gets expensive quickly.
Second, the patch adds a commit_super call, and changes sync() to use
that instead of write_super.  This allows the FS to skip the commit when
write_super is called.
This does lead to fewer commits and longer running transactions, but
does not increase the amount of time it takes the write() call to
complete.  It does increase the time between when you make a metadata
change and when that change actually goes to the disk.
