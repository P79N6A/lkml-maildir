Hi,
I use Linux kernel 2.0.36 and 2.1.132 on a dual PPro@200 with a Tyan board.
I have a PCI RTL8139-based NIC and it locks up the computer under heavy
traffic.
One suggestion I learned from Paul Gortmakers page, was to have the card
inserted to a bus master slot.
My NIC card is in PCI slot 1, so that should be OK.
Does anyone know about this problem?
Bas.
