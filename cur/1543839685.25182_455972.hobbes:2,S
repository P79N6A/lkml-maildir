No problem. The second URL pointed to a x86_64 version where I tried to
break out code to make some kind of generic NUMA emulation layer. At
that time no one seemed interested in that strategy as a simple resource
control solution so I gave that up.
For x86_64 I think it's only worth mucking around with the code if
people believe that it is the right way to go for in-kernel resource
control.
The x86_64 patches above include code to divide each real NUMA node into
several smaller emulated nodes, but that is kind of pointless if people
only use it for non-resource control purposes, ie just to play with
CPUSETS and NUMA on non-NUMA hardware. For simple purposes like that I
think the existing NUMA emulation code for x86_64 works perfectly well.
I still think that i386 users would benefit from NUMA emulation though.
If you want me to up-port the i386-specific code just let me know.
Thanks,
