I would prefer it if you could also merge in this patch at the same 
time:

With the aforementioned patch merged in, this will generate a 
warning for each dropped device.  The call to 
unregister_dropped_devices() should come after the up_write().
You might also consider adding a call to unregister_dropped_devices()  
in the error path of device_suspend() -- in theory even an aborted 
suspend might cause a device to malfunction.
Otherwise this looks okay.
