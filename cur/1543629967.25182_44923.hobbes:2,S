I said "in turn old 2.4 kernels were all wrong", that means the _old_ 2.4
kernels not recent 2.4.x, look at 2.4.7 for istance.

The change between 2.4.7 and 2.4.19pre8 doesn't look intentional, Hugh
just gone back to the old way of doing the flush in 2.4 that apparently
was buggy and that's why his patch his wrong (I assume this was the case
for him because I falled in the same trap too).

anything older than 2.4.10.

Fine with me if Marcelo drops it, but I guess sparc/m68k/mips users
won't like not be able to use 2.4 kernels anymore unless they first
rewrite the entere cache flushing in the middle of a stable series.
If you don't drop it in late 2.4 then my suggestion looks still a nice
common code cleanup and it's functional equivalent to the current
2.4.19pre8 code, so it cannot go wrong.
