Any sort of kernel space hooks for an x86 emulator would be awesome.  I
would use them immediately to get at some of the stuff S3 hides in its
BIOS.
In terms of which emulator to use,
Bochs is probably right out because it is non-free.  
The DOSemu/TWIN emulator only does 16-bit (some video BIOS need 32-bit
instructions)
The x86emu project is already fairly far along, FWIW, and x86emu is what
XFree86 uses when VM86 isn't available, such as on a non-x86 box. 
Ulrich Weigand also wrote an x86 binary emulator from scratch for the
WINE project, though alas he nor others have had time to integrate it
into WINE.  [digress: I'm surprised some enterprising hacker hasn't
already tried to get Windows EXEs running on their Alpha/PPC/Sparc box]
