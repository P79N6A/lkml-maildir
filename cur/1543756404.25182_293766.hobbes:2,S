The BitKeeper users sometimes make use of the SCCS rules.
BK installs itself in such a way as to provide the SCCS commands, and
Make will update things if you forget to do a bk -r get -Sq after a
pull.
From a totally clean tree, this doesn't work (I forget why, offhand, but
I think it's something to do with the *config targets), but it is
helpful at times from partially clean trees to automatically "get" from
the SCCS copy of the file.
