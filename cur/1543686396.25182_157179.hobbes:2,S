This is correct:  Intel dropped the RNG after the first few releases of
their ICH chipset (which is now up to ICH5).  Not much Dell can do about
it.
Intel's RNG was slow anyway, compared to the AMG and now VIA RNGs, so
you didn't want it anyway :)  I really like VIA's "xstore", which is an
RNG implemented via a CPU instruction.  That way you don't need a kernel
driver at all, really.
