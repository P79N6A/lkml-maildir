Well I suppose that's true if you're using the term in a cache-related
sense (which I gather is the convention).
OTOH, if you think about it from the view point of the PCI framework,
the terminology actually does make sense even in this odd case --
`consistent' memory is indeed consistent (both CPU and device see a
single image), but other memory used to communicate with the driver is
`inconsistent' (CPU and device see different things until a sync
operation is done).

Indeed.  What I'm doing is basically bounce-buffers.
