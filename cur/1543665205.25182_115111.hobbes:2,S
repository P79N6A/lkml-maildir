Exactly ... all this tweaking, and setting up every app individually is bad.
It should "just frigging work" ;-) We seem to be pretty close to that
at the moment - 2.5 feels *so* much better than 2.4 already (2.4 degenerates
into a total slug overnight, presumably when things like man page reindexes
thrash the page cache).
The fact that the debian renice of the X server actually breaks things is
probably good news ... we're actually paying real attention to the nice
value ;-)
