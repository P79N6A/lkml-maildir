I suspect all these kind of patches are introducing additional problems.
This one certainly is.  Who's auditing all these patches?  I mean _properly_
auditing them rather than just saying "that's a good idea"?
In this case, you're calling parport_serial_pci_remove() in the failure
path.  That's fine, but this opens the possibility of it being called
twice - once on resume failure and once when the device/driver is
removed.  If this happens, we dereference a NULL pointer. *BAD*.
So, the original without this resume fix is probably far better than
with the fix.
So, patch violently rejected.
