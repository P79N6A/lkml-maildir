OK, yet another comment on this update :)
Overall I like the idea of separating MSI and MSI-X support and
getting rid of the msi_alloc_vectors()/msi_free_vectors().  However it
seems there is a slight asymmetry in how MSI-X is handled now.
If a driver calls pci_enable_msix() (and the call succeeds), then the
device is immediately put into MSI-X mode -- that is, the enable bit
of its MSI-X capability is set.  However, this bit will not be cleared
until the driver calls free_irq() for the last MSI-X vector.
This means that for a driver to clear the MSI-X enable bit, it must
first do request_irq() on all the vectors it was assigned and then
call free_irq().  It seems quite possible to me that a driver may not
use all the MSI-X vectors it is assigned, so device cleanup becomes a
problem.  Also, there is no way for the driver to free its unused
MSI-X vectors.
It seems we need a pci_disable_msix() call to match the
pci_enable_msix() call.  (And remove the disabling of MSI-X from the
free_irq code path) 
I guess there is actually a similar problem with MSI -- if a driver
calls pci_enable_msi(), MSI will not be disabled until the driver does
request_irq/free_irq.  This is not quite as serious because a driver
is unlikely not to use the since MSI vector it gets, but it is still a
problem for error cleanup paths.  So maybe we need pci_disable_msi()
as well.
What do you think?
Thanks,
  Roland
