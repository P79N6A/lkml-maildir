Read it again. *Out* not *in*. Listening is usually done globally,
sometimes bound to specific *addresses*, rarely bound to specific
*interfaces*. That has nothing to do with the issue at hand.

IOS is not a general purpose OS though. Your argument appears to
be that your assumptions are correct because you think it's
right - even though others do not and can tell you why. Can we
get back to a discussion of why the current behaviour is inherently
"right" or not?
