Hi !
I usually play some mp3 while I'm working on my Linux based server. 2.0.x
kernels almost NEVER break the playing. Kernel 2.2.2 is not as good as
2.0.x but it's good enough. But 2.2.3 seems to be MORE "mp3-playing-breaker" :-)
Playing stops for a moment when I compiling programs. It has always never
happend with 2.2.2 and even more rarly with 2.0.x kernels.
What is the wrong about scheduler of 2.2.3 which cause this ? Or it's
something harddisk related (playing mp3 from harddisk) problem ?
Thanks, 
- Gabor
