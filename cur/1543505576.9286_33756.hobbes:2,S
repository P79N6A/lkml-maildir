Hi,
is there a proper way (or is there a way _at all_) for a process to
see (and modify in the case of authorized processes) the ulimits of
another process, especially RLIMIT_CPU? Something like sys_getrlimit()
with an additional PID-argument? I would expect this information to
show up somewhere in /proc/PID/stat, but the only ulimit present there
is RLIMIT_RSS. Would it be a possible security hole to give this
information in /proc/PID/stat?
And yet another question (but related for our purposes): are there
plans to include a cummulative CPU time limit for a process and all its
children into the kernel, as one needs it for a batch-queuing system to
be able to enforce a 'per request' CPU time limit?
Thank you in advance for your help.
Cheers,
Bernd
