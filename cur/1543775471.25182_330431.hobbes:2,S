So the open() hangs indefinately. but what if blackhat tries to install
a package from a no longer existing server on /net or via NFS?
A user supplied pathname is not to be trusted by any setuid (or full
root) program.
Another example: I'm not sure if there are still /dev/tty devices which
may block indefinately upon open() but:
-	I have yet to see a setuid program which always uses O_NONBLOCK
	when opening user supplied pathnames.
-	one cannot stat() and then open() because that gives a race.
