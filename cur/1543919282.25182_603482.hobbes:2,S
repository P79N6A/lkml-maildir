At a minimum, I think(?) we all agree that current upstream aic94xx 
behavior is nice:  allow the admin to override the WWN manually, even if 
the adapter already has one.
As to the question of request_firmware() versus sysfs, it's IMO largely 
a question of taste -- do you like the "get property" on-demand pull 
model, or a push model that presumes the property must be set before it 
is needed?  And which solution requires the least amount of additional 
userspace machinery in order to be usable?
