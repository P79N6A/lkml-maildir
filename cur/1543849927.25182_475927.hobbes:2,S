I agree _verifying_ this for all config and arch combinations is hard.
But my point is that right now we're `solving' this at the user (of the
include) level, which is an order of magnitude more work.
If the includes were (sufficiently) self-contained, the driver writers would
have to care less about config/arch dependencies.
