Have you thought about making it an 'rtc' replacement and getting it to
conform to the API of it to what ever degree makes sense ? then it would
be a general replacement for 'rtc' if it could be opened multipule times
(as with generic event interfaces) with different timing scenarios per
thread.

Don't worry about what I just said, really. The fact that this driver exists
make it possible for heavy modification of just about any sort.
