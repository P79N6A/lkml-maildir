From a legal standpoint, all Motorola has to do is to release the code 
under the terms of the GPL version 2.
Motorola (or whoever else has it) retains the copyright of the code and 
can even licence this code to other people under different terms. [1]
The mentioned "Developer's Certificate of Origin" only describes a 
formalized way to express that the code is available under the terms of 
the GPL and that you agree that the metadata will be stored 
indefinitely. Nothing interesting from a standpoint, and since you'll 
hopefully read Documentation/SubmittingPatches before submitting your 
code, you'll anyway see it when you need it.

[1] but after published under the GPL, it will be available under the 
    terms of the GPL forever for both the Linux kernel and other 
    projects
