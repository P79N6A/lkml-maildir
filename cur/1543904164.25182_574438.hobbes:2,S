Keith Owens did report an issue with the double probe, but I confess
I don't fully understand it.
The real problem was that the serial driver claimed a non-serial
device.  On many laptops, there's an IR device at 0x3e8, IRQ 3.
The serial driver claimed this as ttyS2, using IRQ 4.  So if you
wanted to use the IR device, you had to either:
  - use setserial to make the serial driver forget about ttyS2
    so an IR driver could claim it, or
  - use setserial to change the IRQ to 3 and just use the device
    in SIR mode, which is 16550-compatible so you can use the
    serial driver
I didn't express that very clearly in the changelog.
