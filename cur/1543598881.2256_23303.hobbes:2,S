Yes, Linux does have a nice chicken-and-egg process.  But unless you're
building a brand new arch, which means you have to fix glibc and gcc and
binutils to know about you, throwing in python isn't going to hurt you.
And if you're trying to do this on the machine you're trying to make
supported, you're going to have lots of fun.  In other words, I don't
see this as an issue.  If you're talking about bringing up a new board
for supported platform X, the only issue is getting Python2 onto the
system.  Which isn't nearly as painful as getting the kernel source, glibc
or gcc will be.  It'll only be maybe twice as painful as getting the bash
sources over (2.05) even. :)
