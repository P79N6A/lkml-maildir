All I've found so far is:
http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/als2000/full_papers/bryantscale/bryantscale.pdf
which is based on the 2.2.14-SMP -vs- 2.3.99-SMP kernels.

If you find anything else, or get forwarded any information, please post the relevant information where possible.  There are many of us looking for benchmark information on recent 2.4.x kernels.  Seems like a few companies/projects are currently looking at the costs/benefits/risks of moving up to the new kernel.
