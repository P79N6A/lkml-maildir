On this theme, I'd like to know:
    - are dnotify / lease / lock reliable indicators on this filesystem?
      (i.e. dnotify is reliable on all local filesystems, but not over any
      of the remote ones AFAIK).
    - is stat() reliable (local filesystems and many remote) or potentially
      out of date without open/close (NFS due to attribute cacheing)
