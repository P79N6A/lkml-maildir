Since i started using 2.2.14 i never could capture pictures or videos
anymore. I can watch tv just fine, its only when it starts to capture
that it hangs. It doesn't hang exactly, the application just sits
waiting for something and has to be killed. It does the same in every
app.
Is this fixed in the 2.2.15pre's ?
Please CC: me , im not in the list.
