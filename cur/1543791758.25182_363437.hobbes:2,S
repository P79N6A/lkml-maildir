IMHO the zero here is a bug because we do want the limit to be
MAX_NON_LFS. A null pointer should be acceptable as a parameter but as
we're already passing semi-arbitrary max values, why not make them
consistent.

I tried to replicate that check from vfs_sendfile() but it turned out
that while comparing *ppos and max both these values are unknown and
must be checked and computed, which is done in vfs_sendfile so there's
no need to do it again. Also if we caught an error in that check, we'd
screw something up (didn't trace it so I don't know what exactly but
something for sure) by not calling fput_light() near the exit point of
do_sendfile.
On a more optimistic note, this kernel with the sendfile fix survived
the night at load 40 (two vservers running bonnie++, another one with
a looped make -j8 of the kernel and about a dozen of mostly idle
ones). We had to stop the tests in the morning as the machine was
almost impossible to do any work on, but no signs of crashes. As I'm
facing another kernel build soon, are there any known issues with ACPI
on SMP with vservers? (AFAIK ACPI is needed to use HT on Intel CPUs
and I haven't compiled it in yet since I'm not currently using HT
CPUs)
