I disagree, I keeping the code separate (layering if you will) makes it 
easer to use and maintain.

What makes trace complicated?  It is just, open ,start/stop, close.  I 
can't see how an trace API could be any simpler.

No regression has occurred.  According the relay documentation if you 
use global bufferers you must use locking.  If you don't want to use 
locking use per-cpu bufferers.

If you don't approve of the locking then use per-cpu bufferers.  The 
example will do ether.

So the only way I should pass ASCII to user space is using printk?  I 
don't understand that.  Again nothing in trace limits you to ASCII data.

I impose no restriction on what type of data you can pass over trace's 
fast dedicated channels.

Is your complaint with the overhead of setting up a trace channel or the 
overhead of writing to a trace channel?   For the later, trace adds 
almost no overhead on top of relay.

I am using the layer definitions described in trace.txt.  In this 
definition relay is a buffering layer.

If by knobs you mean the trace controls.  The only one that has any 
effect on the "speed" of tracing is the control to start and stop 
tracing.  And that had been designed to impose the minimal impact 
possible (one "if" in the tracing path).
