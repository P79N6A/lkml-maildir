It's in -mm. The devpath for all block devices, like for all other
devices, will start with /devices/* if !SYSFS_DEPRECATED.

No, you have to use kobject_get_path() to get the path to the object.
This will also handle devices where the name contains '/' which needs to
be translated to '!', which is broken in this patch.

We expect the next kernel to have it.
Btw: BLKGETNAME should probably be renamed to something which contains
DEVPATH, to make clear that it's a path to, and not the name of the
device.
