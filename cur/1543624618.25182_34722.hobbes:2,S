You offer no reason why the routine in question _should_ be exported for use
by binary-only modules. EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() was invented to allow authors of
code to make their intentions clear; if you disagree with the decision in
this case then either take it up in private with the author of this code, or
switch to BSD, which doesn't suffer from this pesky GPL-thingy.
