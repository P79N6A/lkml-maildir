Subject: JFS resize=0 problem in 2.6.0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Let me know if I'm missing the goal of the code here, but lines 261-273
of linux-2.6.0/fs/jfs/super.c are:
case Opt_resize:
{
	char *resize = args[0].from;
	if (!resize || !*resize) {    /* LINE 264 HERE */
		*newLVSize = sb->s_bdev->bd_inode->i_size >>
			sb->s_blocksize_bits;
		if (*newLVSize == 0)
			printk(KERN_ERR
			"JFS: Cannot determine volume size\n");
	} else
		*newLVSize = simple_strtoull(resize, &resize, 0);
	break;
}
It seems to me that line 264 is attempting to test for the mount 
paramater "resize=0", and when it comes across this, resize to the full
size of the volume.  However, this doesn't work.  I believe it should
test for the char '0'  (*resize=='0'), not against literal zero.  
Let me know if I'm way off base here.  But the below patch does allow a
$ mount -o remount,resize=0 /mnt/test    
to resize the jfs filesystem to the full size of the volume.
Ok, I've never submitted a patch before, but here goes:
