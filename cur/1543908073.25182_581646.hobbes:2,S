fchdir doesn't pretend to do a lookup by passing the LOOKUP_CHDIR flag, it 
indicates that a chdir is being done. The lookup happened earlier at a time 
at which the kernel didn't know that a chdir would follow. If fchdir doesn't 
pass down the LOOKUP_CHDIR flag, then that flag is pretty pointless: it could 
be bypassed any time by an open followed by fchdir.

I'm sorry, but the dentry and vfsmnt in struct file is *not* only used for 
informational purposes: openat does a lookup relative to a file's dentry and 
vfsmnt, and there are other examples as well.
The dentry and vfsmnt identify a particular object in the filesystem 
hierarchy. As long as the file hasn't been deleted, they can be used to 
compute a pathname that leads to the file (if the file is reachable at all). 
You can used that pathname for more than informational purposes. It is real, 
and canonical too.

What you are saying doesn't make sense. It makes perfect sense to compute the 
pathname of an open file in some situations. Obviously it does not make sense 
when the file has been deleted, and you really do want to detect when a file 
has become unreachable (lazily unmounted, other namespace, whatever). You 
will always find that out when trying to compute its pathname, so that's not 
an issue. (Caveat: this requires the d_path fixes I have posted earlier.)
Thanks,
Andreas
