Hi Andrew, all.
I have the same problem here with 2.5.57/8/9 with a Toshiba 2410 Laptop. 
Very funny also. The exact system lockup varies according to printk's 
inserted in the code.

Yes it is.
do_IRQ() is called for irq line 9, calls handle_IRQ_event() which then 
calls acpi_irq and finally ev_sci_handler().
This repeats 'ad infinitum'. Didn't wait for more than a few minutes, 
but it looks like it will.
The interrupts are handled at acpi_ev_gpe_detect (), which returns 1. At 
this point in_irq() returns 0x00010000 (or 0x00001000, don't have a 
serial console :/)
Any ideas ??? Need some more debugging ?
Funny enough, without the printk's it usually hangs at 
create_workqueue(), while doing wait_for_completion() - seems the kernel 
thread simply fails to get run.
