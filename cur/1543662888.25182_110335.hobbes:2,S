No - this is exactly what is intended. Note that jiffies_msb_flips counts
flips of the MSB of jiffies, i.e., it's LSB should always be equal to the
MSB of jiffies.
We use it as a measure of whether jiffies_msb_flips is still up to date -
when the msb of jiffies flip, we have 2^31/HZ seconds to detect that
in the timer routine.
