Here is the implementation :-)
Comments are welcome.

To change it, we can dynamically overwrite the __mark_near_jump_select_##name
value (a byte) to (__mark_jump_call_##name - __mark_near_jump_##name).
So we have one architecture specific optimisation within the architecture
agnostic marking mechanism.
Comments are welcome.
