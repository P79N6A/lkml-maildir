I have an application (diablo dreader) where the header-info database
basically consists of ~40.000 files, one for each group (it's more
complicated that that, but never mind that now).
If you grow those files randomly by a few hundred bytes every update,
the filesystem gets hopelessly fragmented.
I'm using XFS with preallocation turned on, and biosize=18 (which
makes it preallocate in blocks of 256KB), and a homebrew patch that
leaves the preallocated space on disk preallocated even if the
file is closed .. and it helps enormously.
Mike.
