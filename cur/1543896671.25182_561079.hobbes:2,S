Err, re-read it, I hope you'll see that I agree with you - I actually just meant 
the --assume-clean workaround stuff :)
If you end up 'fiddling' in md because someone specified --assume-clean on a 
raid5 [in this case just to save a few minutes *testing time* on system with a 
heavily choked bus!] then that adds *even more* complexity and exception cases 
into all the stuff you described.
I'm very much for the fs layer reading the lower block structure so I don't have 
to fiddle with arcane tuning parameters - yes, *please* help make xfs self-tuning!
Keeping life as straightforward as possible low down makes the upwards interface 
more manageable and that goal more realistic...
