Very repeatable.  This workload is very steady and resolution in throughput
is repeatable down to 0.1%.  We toss everything below that level as noise.

This workload has been around for 10+ years and people at Intel studied the
characteristics of this workload inside out for 10+ years.  Every stones will
be turned at least more than once while we tune the entire setup making sure
everything is well balanced.  And we tune the system whenever there is a
hardware change.  Data layout on the disk spindle are very well balanced.

I sure will make my management know that Linus wants to see the performance
number on a daily bases (I will ask for a couple of million dollar to my
manager for this project :-))
