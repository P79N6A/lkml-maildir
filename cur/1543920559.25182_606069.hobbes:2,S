Hi,
As stated in the subject, I cannot boot the current -git (most recent commit
821f3eff7cdb9d6c7076effabd46c96c322daed1) using GRUB on x86-64 openSUSE 10.2.
The GRUB says that the kernel image is too big and doesn't fit into memory, but
the kernel has been built and installed in exactly the same way as all of the
previous -git kernels.
Greetings,
Rafael
