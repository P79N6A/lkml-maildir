Hello:
The 2.4.17 patch comes with a change to uaccess.h, which
contains the following:
- *  These functions have a non-standard call interface
+ *  These functions have standard call interface
Does it look familiar to anyone? The change is in Marcelo's
tree now, but I am curious what it actually does.
The 2.4.17 patch readme says "This patch contains the current
recommended kernel 2.4.7 code base (up to 2002-01-21),
adapted to kernel 2.4.17.", but I cannot find this change
in any published 2.4.7 patches. I am pretty sure there must
be a good reason for the change, and it's interesting to
know what it is.
