I know, it happens all the time: vulnerabilities are fixed because
they are bugs, and not because they are vulnerabilities.  It's
unfortunate if people are unnecessarily exposed to the vulnerability
(because they don't know about it and don't apply the fix as a result),
but it's better than carrying around the bug indefinitely.
But if there's considerable evidence that you might have fixed a
security bug, preserving this information (and other bits that are
immediately obvious to you as a developer, but not necessarily who
reviews the issue) seems worthwhile.  Maybe you don't want to put it
into the public commit message, but forwarding what you have to some
trusted group of volunteers would make sense.  The volunteers would
distill the information, add more data and assign a CVE if necessary,
and declassify the information as soon as the public is ready (in the
form of a short security advisory, like the ones you see for most
applications).
Does this sound too far-fetched?  Why don't you think this would be a
valuable service to all users, vanilla kernels or not?

It doesn't matter much if the fix is in the kernel.org tree, when I'm
supposed to use vendor kernels. 8-)
