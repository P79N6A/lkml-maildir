When they did crash they were under relativily low load.  I have 8 nodes in an LVS cluster all doing the same thing, mail (qmail,pop,imap), web(apache,java servlets), ftp, bind.  I actually capture top and ps outputs every minute, so I do have the last capture before the crash if you would like that.
