Whoopie from ThinkWiki just sent me an email, calling my attention to the
fact that the patch you submitted is in fact different from the one I
merged... something I should have triple-verified.  It appears the t60p has
the bay in a different ACPI node than some other *60 ThinkPads.  Either
that, or the node moves depending on ICHR mode set in the BIOS.
So I apologise for the screw up, and:

I am merging your patch into the ibm-acpi tree and will ask Len to push it
to Linus.  Now, please excuse me while I go look for a new brown-paperbag
hat...
