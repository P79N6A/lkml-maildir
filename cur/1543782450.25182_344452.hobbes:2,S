Hi folks,
We have ~2k of printf format specs like this:
"%s: Transmit timed out, status %4.4x, PHY status %4.4x, resetting...\n"
IIRC %04x and %4.4x is totally equivalent. I even tested that
(test program is not here at the moment).
I have patches to save that 2k, if anybody knows about
any subtle differences between %04x and %4.4x please speak up.
