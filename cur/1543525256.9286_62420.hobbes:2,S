Okay. Establishing a least upper bound for the cap_bound is hard so I
suspect that in practice this will be left as the full set on many systems.

I've just taken another look at what it does and now I understand why
he thinks that. It falls into roughly the same category as
cap_sys_ptrace - it allows you to cross a boundary between different
processes, even when those processes have different privileges (by
virtue of having running under different uids or by being chrooted to
different directories).
It's the kind of thing you want to give to the system administrator
(when they login interactively as root), but you don't want to give to
any system program. That's okay - whenever you start a system program,
you need to throw away unused capabities, otherwise the program has
full access to the system anyway.
On the grounds of orthogonality, is the any chance of having the
kernel start init with all+eip, and make it init's responsibility to
throw away undesirable capabilities? This moves policy from kernel- to
user-space, and it removes the special case code for init in
exec.c:compute_creds. If init then reads a configuration file for the
default capabilities, you will have no policy set in stone.

Thanks - I'd appreciate that.
