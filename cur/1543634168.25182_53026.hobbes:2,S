Not that, I hope.  Possibly it's the interaction between
block_write_full_pages's memset outside i_size, truncate and lookup.
It took me a ridiculous amount of time to get that "correct", so
it's a suspicion point.   Or possibly locking between lookup and
truncate (rmdir) and/or creat.
Dave, I assume this is with 8k pages and 4k blocks?
Is it repeatable enough to conduct a little experiment?  Like, lock the page
in ext2_find_entry?
