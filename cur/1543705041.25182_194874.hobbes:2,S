The alarm indicator is "sticky".  Even though the present
readings are within limits, the alarm says that the voltage
moved outside its limit since the last time you ran sensors.
Trying running sensors 5 times, at 2 second intervals.  If
the voltage always stays within the limits but the alarm
is not cleared, then maybe there is a problem with the
driver.  If that's the case, please follow up on the sensors
mailing list.
