Perhaps
	void sched_exit(struct task_struct *p)
	{
		task_t *t, *did_fork = p->parent;
		if (!thread_group_leader(p))
			list_for_each_entry(t, p->thread_group)
				if (!t->exit_state) {
					did_fork = t;
					break;
				}
		... give time_slice to did_fork ..
	}
may improve things a little bit, because the rest of time_slice doesn't leak
off the thread group.
However this is not very nice and we have the same problem with CLONE_PARENT.
