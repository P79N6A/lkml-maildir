That doesn't change anything, apart from adding a line "DEBUG_PAGEALLOC"
to the oopses. Do I have to enable the debugging manually? After a quick
grep over the sources and a google-session I think not but I'm no
kernel-hacker.

Unfortunately the only change seems to be, that the Keyboard-Leds don't
flash after the crash. Everything else is the same.
Could a hardware-error cause this?
Thanks again,
