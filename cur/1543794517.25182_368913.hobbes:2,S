No, that was really the point, even on multiple systems using spindown, 
I have no failures. I see four possible causes:
  1 - spindown
  2 - laptop mode
  3 - 1 + 2
  4 - bad hardware, kernel not at fault
Since I have a lot of (1) data I thought eliminating that as a cause by 
itself might be helpful.
