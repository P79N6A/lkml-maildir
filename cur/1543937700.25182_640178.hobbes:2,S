thanks Andi for porting your CPA queue ontop of PAT. Now that PAT 
support is getting into shape i've test-merged your CPA series to 
x86.git.
v2.6.25 merging of CPA is still somewhat in limbo but worst-case i think 
we can still get away with just doing wbinvd instead of clflush and get 
rid of most of the risks that way. Could you please add a boot option 
and Kconfig option that does that? Something like "noclflush" and a 
.config option to achieve the same - just like we do for PAT.
We've got way too much stuff going on at the moment - and the PAT bits 
are more fundamental and more important than nice but non-essential 
optimizations like CPA. There's still a lot of cruft all around this 
area.
One thing, you undid a cleanup patch:

|  Undo random white space changes. This reverts

this is perfectly fine as we do not want to make your merging harder via 
cleanups, as long as you redo the cleanups after your series. Your new 
code is pretty ugly to look at, and this very much shows in the 
checkpatch metrics too:
                                       errors   lines of code   errors/KLOC
 arch/x86/mm/pageattr_32.c                 29             419          69.2
 arch/x86/mm/pageattr_64.c                 31             384          80.7
prior the undo it was:
                                       errors   lines of code   errors/KLOC
 arch/x86/mm/pageattr_32.c                  0             294             0
 arch/x86/mm/pageattr_64.c                  0             275             0
please restore that cleanliness state. Thanks,
