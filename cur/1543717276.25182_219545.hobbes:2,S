Well, the question is why did those folks who care about it (Oracle it
seems) not do it 6-12 month ago?
This oh shit oracle needs it we need to come up with a hack mentality
sucks big time.  If oracle (or $ISV/$IHV) they should send patches in
time so we can discuss it.  In fact these patches don't even come from
Oracle but from Intel which shows something is seriously wrong with all
this.
