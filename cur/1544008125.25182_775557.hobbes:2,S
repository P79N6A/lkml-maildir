That's kinda (and by kinda I mean really) disgusting.  Hiding that two
levels deep in what is effectively the hash table code where no one will
ever see it is really bad.  It also makes you lazy thinking that the
hash code will just know how to take references on whatever you give to
it.
I think cr_obj_ref_grab() is hideous obfuscation and needs to die.
Let's just do the get_file() directly, please.
