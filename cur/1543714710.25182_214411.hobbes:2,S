You are wrong :)  Compare the underlying asm.
Proper use of barriers tells the compiler when it cannot cache certain 
loads and stores in registers.  'volatile' is an atomic bomb to the 
compiler, killing many valid optimizations while (sometimes) hiding 
bugs.  It almost always indicates that the programmer did not bother 
thinking about when and where DMA memory needs to be accessed.
