Look for info on irqbalance (depends which linux distribution you
are using). You might not be running it at all, and it is completely
optional. There is also a kernel level IRQ balancer that may or
may not be configured.

man irqbalance
Note: irqbalance has heuristics about device names and driver names,
it might be worthwhile to either update the source and teach it about
infiniband, or work with existing heuristics (ie. call your interrupt "eth0", "eth1",...)

MSIX is not directly related to affinity. But with MSIX you can have multiple
CPU's all working at once. The device needs to return some info, and the driver
has to register multiple times.
Regular round-robin of network IRQ's is cache hostile, and that is why
irqbalance tries to keep them on the same processor.
