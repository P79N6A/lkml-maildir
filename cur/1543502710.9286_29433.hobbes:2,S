Trond,
   I was messing with it some more and determined that if the hostname
was set to xxxx.math.duke.edu, the su fails every other time.  However,
if the hostname is xxxx instead, it works everytime.  In addition, the 
directory ~/.xauth is not created when the hostname is xxxx but is when 
the hostname is xxxx.math.duke.edu.
For now I'll just use the hostname without domain name and it appears to
work but hopefully this info will help you squash some bugs.
