Thanks for your patience with this, Yu, I know it's been a long haul. :)
I applied 1-9 to my linux-next branch; and at least patch #10 needs a respin, 
so can you re-do 10-13 as a new patch set?
On re-reading the last thread, there was a lot of smoke, but very little fire 
afaict.  The main questions I saw were:
  1) do we need SR-IOV at all?  why not just make each subsystem export
     devices to guests?
    This is a bit of a red herring.  Nothing about SR-IOV prevents us from
    making subsystems more v12n friendly.  And since SR-IOV is a hardware
    feature supported by devices these days, we should make Linux support it.
  2) should the PF/VF drivers be the same or not?
    Again, the SR-IOV patchset and PCI spec don't dictate this.  We're free to
    do what we want here.
  3) should VF devices be represented by pci_dev structs?
    Yes.  (This is an easy one :)
  4) can VF devices be used on the host?
    Yet again, SR-IOV doesn't dictate this.  Developers can make PF/VF combo
    drivers or split them, and export the resulting devices however they want. 
    Some subsystem work may be needed to make this efficient, but SR-IOV
    itself is agnostic about it.
So overall I didn't see many objections to the actual code in the last post, 
and the issues above certainly don't merit a NAK IMO...
Given a respin of 10-13 I think it's reasonable to merge this into 2.6.29, but 
I'd be much happier about it if we got some driver code along with it, so as 
not to have an unused interface sitting around for who knows how many 
releases.  Is that reasonable?  Do you know if any of the corresponding PF/VF 
driver bits are ready yet?
Thanks,
