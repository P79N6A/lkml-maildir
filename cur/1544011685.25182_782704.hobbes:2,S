Andrew, do you have any principial objections against having this in 
v2.6.29?
This dragged on for a long time, and i think the debug output is useful 
and it tells us something that we have no other tool for at the moment to 
figure out. We can tell stuck tasks, stuck files and other stuck resources 
easily - we can even see fast slab leaks, but we cannot really tell slow, 
long-term slab leaks apart from regular slab prints, and we cannot 
identify the source of them. The false positive rate of kmemleak has 
decreased substantially as well, over the earlier design.
