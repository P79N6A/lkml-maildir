I think a device daemon makes a lot of sense, as does a standard
kernel notification mechanism for it.  I do make the observation that
if you have a device node management daemon, there is no need for the
virtual device filesystem.  devfsd (devd) *does* make a lot of sense;
it is the rest of the filesystem that doesn't.  What I would like to
see is devd, but operating on a physical filesystem where data can be
retained.
