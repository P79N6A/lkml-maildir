	2.2.10 and 2.3.6 have a change to include/linux/lp.h that was apparently
	intended to fix a problem where some kernel routines were being
	exported even when __KERNEL__ was not defined.  However, it also
	accidentally disabled about half of the hardware related declarations,
	causing tunelp to fail to compile.  Here is the patch.
Hmm. I think andrea's tunelp source has a private lp.h.
I think recent util-linux tunelp source has a private lp.h.
So, if you need kernel patches to get tunelp to compile
then probably you have an outdated tunelp source.
