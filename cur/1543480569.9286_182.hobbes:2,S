I don't understand how you can have the kernel copy stuff to/from areas of
memory it does not have direct access to. 
In the case of the DMA issue, the hardware cannot access >16Mb so it
needs an ouside process (the kernel) to move the stuff to where it can
access it. the kernel has direct access to everything and can move it as
needed. 
almost need another process (memorykernel???) that would move the memory
around so that the kernel can access it.
