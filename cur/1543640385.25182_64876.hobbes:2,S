I took a run at writing generic single-linked list push and pop macros, to be 
used in the form:
	push_list(foo_list, foo_node);
and
	foo_node = pop_list(foo_list);
They came out predictably ugly:
#define push_list(_LIST_, _NODE_) \
	_NODE_->next = _LIST_; \
	_LIST_ =_NODE_;
#define pop_list(_LIST_) ({ \
	typeof(_LIST_) _NODE_ = _LIST_; \
	_LIST_ = _LIST_->next; \
	_NODE_; })
These work but imho, they are too ugly to live.  For one thing, they assume 
the link field is named 'next' and I don't see a nice way around that.
Before moving them to my scraps.c file I thought I'd let other people throw 
some tomatoes at them.
