 I agree with the BIOS theory. My computer (IBM dual PPro-180) lights a LED
during POST and this is where it hangs when I try to reboot. 
 Furthermore, two other LEDs show that the AP processor is stopped and the
boot processor is active.

P.S.
 It's a pity I can't verify this with NT, but NT just hangs when I try to
install it on this machine and even the guys at M$ don't know why. They just
say things like "Are you sure that this what's printed on the screen?" as if
they don't know their own error messages. :)
