Which weren't a regression or anything new.
Alan: regressions are what we don't do. Ever. If your second patch is 
found to have some other problems, we revert them both. It's that simple. 
It's better to stay in place than walk backwards, even if the "backwards" 
is just for a few people.
So far, it fixed at least Alessandro's problems, so here's to hoping there 
aren't any others..
