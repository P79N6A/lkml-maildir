that's quite a normal message, not sure why that would constitute a problem.

Have you tried to only `ifconfig ethX down` ? my own i965 board shuts down perfectly 
fine without unloading the e1000 driver.

first time I've heard of it!
I'm unsure my BIOS version will be the same as it's a devel system for our drivers, but 
still I have never heard of anyone requiring the full unload of the NIC driver to be 
able to shutdown.
Would you be able to debug a failed shutdown perhaps and capture the console output? 
when exactly does it `stall` ? What other interrupts are assigned on your system? Did 
other BIOS versions work correctly?
