OK, I'll take the last bits of your patches 5/6 that aren't already
cleaned up and send out a unified patchset for you to add your
acked/signed off by/reviewed by as appropriate.
These are:
-add stack_addr() macro
-I prefer the table defintion macros in mine as it avoids the need to
cast the pointer passed to test_bit, but if you want them
to be u32 as in your patch, I can change it.
-wrmsr/wrmsrl - use wrmsr() for both
-call is_IF_modifier with p->ainsn.insn in both
-check casting of jprobe_saved_sp, I get some compile warnings currently
with pointer comparisons to signed/unsigned types.
That will eliminate nearly all of the remaining ifdefs in my version,
let me work through this and I'll send out a set for review.
CHeers,
Harvey
