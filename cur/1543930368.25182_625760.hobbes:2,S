A fix for the most likely cause of this problem was merged (7eba5c9d
"[ALSA] hda-codec - Check PINCAP only for PIN widgets") but it seems
that setting CONFIG_SND_HDA_POWER_SAVE can cause the "azx_get_response
timeout, switching to polling mode" message sometimes too.  However
according to Takashi this is really just a cosmetic problem -- polling
mode is not so bad.
