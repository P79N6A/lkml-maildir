right, it means that this was a false report.

you shouldnt trust it anyways. At the moment ~11% of the
stuff we checked is marked as bug, ~24% as false or ignore,
5% pending, 4% resolved and 54% uninspected. If we count
pending and resolved to the bugs, that would mean a 50/50
split between bugs and false positives. So we should not trust
it blind and i try my best to avoid such mistakes.
But I wouldnt say coverity is that bad, and it already helped
us fixing several bugs.
Greetings, Eric
