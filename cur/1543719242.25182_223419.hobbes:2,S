With a 3c905C NIC, I get a kernel panic & hard lock while trying to 
bring up the interface at boot.
After reverting the following patch (introduced in 2.6.6-bk1) there are 
no more kernel panics.  2.6.6 and earlier work fine with this card.

The strange part?  The patch description shows that it tries to fix 
100baseTX-FD problems with 3c905C cards... which it precisely what works 
fine here WITHOUT the patch.
Yell if anyone needs the text of the panic.
(Andrew, this is directed at you because the changelog shows the patch 
came to Linus from you via -mm)
