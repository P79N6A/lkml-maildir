I too have the MSI K7D Master. As Alan mentioned, the 2.4.19-rc2-ac2
patch works fine. My machine has been rock solid and I'm running dual
XP 2000+. However, I'm running Radeon 8500 (I refused to give my money
to a company that doesn't release it's drivers). Bad memory is a
possibility, so run 'memtest' and see what happens as mentioned by
others. Also, I suggest you upgrade to v1.3 of the MSI 6501 BIOS which
is always a good idea. As far as your X crashes, you might try building
the latest X out of CVS and see if that helps at all, but it looks
like memory problems. Spend the money and buy good name brand like
Micron/Crucial has been good for me. Just my $0.02.
