Not true! Killing a getty or agetty or any other login
program cannot prevent a login! Init will just start another
one if there is enough RAM to fork()/exec(). If there isn't,
it has nothing to do with killing the getties and everything
to do with being completely out of RAM. In that case, you
need to enable quotas and not let fork-bombs or other deliberate
crashers be executed by root.

The above shows 4 getty's being killed. They are immediately
restarted by init. These getties become new shell-tasks in
the following order: exec /sbin/login, exec /bin/bash. There are
no additional forks so, in principle, you have nearly all the
resources needed for a shell as soon as a getty is started.
Cheers,
