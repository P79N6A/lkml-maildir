Subject: [PATCH] for sb_card.c in kernel 2.4.2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi folks.  I've never posted a kernel patch before, so I don't know if I
got it right.  I followed the instructions in the FAQ...  I'm not
subscribed, so if you could follow up to jmanson@wam.umd.edu, I would
appreciate it.
This patch adds support for my sound card, which was an OEM version of
the SB AWE32 PnP (Got it from Dell).  It is pretty boring.  I made it for
2.4.2, but none of the patches since then seem to have added this support,
so here it is.
I would appreciate it if it could find its way into the kernel, as
hand-modifying the code after every patch I get from now on would be a
pain.  And I am sure that there are a lot of mystified circa-1996 Dell
owners out there...
Thanks!
