Add bloat to make windows clients happy?

More bloat that does really solve Linux problems... sounds like nasty
hacks to make winduhs hacks work better.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against sane ACLs (POSIX ACLs are not) os
EAs, but justification of "it makes windows clients easier" is pretty
horrendous IMO.
I'd would at some point like to see decent ACLs, but I don't want to
see 'windows ACLs' and all the SID nonsense.
