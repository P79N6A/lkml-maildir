Unfortunately that wouldn't work as I actually have 3 host bridges
on these models, and the windows can be "mixed". One host can have
0x80000000 to 0x9ffffffff (and one region at 0xfx000000), The next
one can have 0xa0000000 to 0xaffffffff and another region at
0xfx000000, etc...

Agreed.

Well, I as pointed out, I may actually need all 4 regions of the host ;)
Anyway, since we agree on copying down the parent regions, and the pci_bus
stucture holds 4 resource slots, then let's copy them all down.
I'll write some code about that when I'm back from vacation and we'll
see what's up. I may end up adding a quirk call inside the
pci_read_bridge_bases
functions so that it's behaviour can be easily overriden if we ever meet
a non-strandard enough bridge to be transparent without having ProgIf code 1
