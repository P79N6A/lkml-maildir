Back when I worked on the HPRT (HPs PA risk real time system) I solved
this problem by embedding a C program in the asm code.  To asm it looked
like macros so ccp stripped it out.  The make rule (a real monster)
stripped out the C program, ran it and set its output down as an xxx.h
file which the asm code then included.  The result was fresh symbol
offsets, etc. but it was UGLY. 
There are two draw backs to these proposals/ implementations, that I
see:
1. They require one or more extra sources that must track the using
code.  HPUX had (has?) an OS wide C program that defines all the symbols
for asm.  Same problem, as symbols come and go it becomes hard to
maintain this code.
2. The symbols are defined as globals.  This means we need to be very
careful in how we name them to managed the global name pool.  It also
tends to push one toward the one file approach to prevent/control dups.
The i386 branch of the tree has only one or two *.S files so I don't see
any of this as a big drawback here, however, other branches have a lot
more *.S files, leading to more confusion.
I assume OFFSETOF is evaluated by cc and not ccp.  If it were otherwise,
we could get ccp to lay down the needed constants.
That said, I suspect that the C folks have hidden something in the
compiler that makes all this go away.  If only we knew where/what it is.
