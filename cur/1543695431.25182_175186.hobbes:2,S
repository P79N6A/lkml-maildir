  I don't have an ECDT either.  Is it possible that the setting of
ec_device_init = 1 is simply misplaced?  I can see why we wouldn't want
to call acpi_os_queue_for_execution() early in bootup, but there ought
to be a fixed point after which it's ok, regardless of whether the
system has the ECDT table.  Would it be sufficient to set ec_device_init
to 1 at the beginning of acpi_ec_add(), with no dependency on the ECDT
table?
