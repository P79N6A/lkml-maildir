Oh, give me a <bleep>ing break, already.
We demonstrably have *enough* trouble keeping the English-only contents of the
Documentation/ directory in sync with the source.  What do you propose to do if/
when some kernel change requires a document update, and we can't find somebody
who is qualified to translate to Swahili, or one of the Baltic languages(*),
and so on? Pretty soon, you have 15 or 20 slowly diverging versions due to
missed updates and the like.
As far as translating the COPYING file, I think you need to see what the FSF
thinks of translating the GPL into other languages:
http://www.fsf.org/licenses/licenses.html
(Bottom line - English is canonical, and the others are basically considered
study aids for the English-challenged).
(*) Don't look at me - although I went bughunting in the cpufreq code, and have
more relatives in Riga than I do in the US, and my Latvian is quite sufficient
to deal with a newspaper, dinner conversation, or television programming, I'd
hate to be the guy trying to understand my attempt to explain the cpufreq code
in Latvian.. ;)
