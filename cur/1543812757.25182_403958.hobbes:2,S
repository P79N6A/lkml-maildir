Im still running a 2.6.11 
Ever since some PCI changes (between 2.6.11 and 2.6.15) I have been
unable to build a kernel that will run with my machine on an 
Intel D945 Motherboard.
I just tried vmlinuz-2.6.16-rc5-git8 and still no luck, the kernel builds,
but during the first few lines of the boot you get the message:
    PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #6 ...
Ive tried stripping things down to just the video card, and still the same
result.
This Motherboard has been available for the better part of a year, and
still no Linux support.  Usually by the time I buy something, its supported.
Anyone working this problem?
