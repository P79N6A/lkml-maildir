Sigh, that took too long.
c000000001d29828 -- address of the struct device I register
c000000001d29818 -- address present in vio_bus_type.devices.list
I think the problem is that bus_add_device() adds a struct device to 
bus_type.devices.list, but that's a a kset! So it contains a list of 
kobjects, not devices. The obvious fix doesn't work because 
driver_attach() got it wrong too. However it seems bus_for_each_dev() 
got it right.
This patch compiles but I haven't tested the driver_attach() part yet. 
Oh also to_dev is different in bus.c than in core.c, so I don't think it 
will work here. I'm going home... I have a vague feeling that some other 
language might work better for all this list stuff..
