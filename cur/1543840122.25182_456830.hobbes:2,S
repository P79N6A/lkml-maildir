It looks like:
.macro note name, type
      .balign 4
      .int    2f - 1f            # n_namesz
      .int    4f - 3f            # n_descsz
      .int    \type            # n_type
      .balign 4
1:    .asciz "\name"
2:    .balign 4
3:
.endm
.macro enote
4:    .balign 4
.endm
so it allows you to put arbitrary stuff in the desc part of the note.  
The downside is that its a little more cumbersome syntactically for the 
common case.
