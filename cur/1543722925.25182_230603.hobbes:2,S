For a lot of them they shouldn't be polling. For those that do in
most cases something like
	struct timeout_timer t;
	timeout_set(t, 5 * HZ)
	timeout_cancel(t)
	if(timeout_expired(t))
Where timeout_timer is effectively an existing timer of add_timer
style and a single variable. The code to build that kind of timer
on top of add_timer is trivial.
