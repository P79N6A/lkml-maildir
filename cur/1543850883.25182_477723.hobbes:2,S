More or less. More concretely:
- there is a single hierarchy of process containers
- each process is a member of exactly one process container
- for each resource controller, there's a hierarchy of resource "nodes"
- each process container is associated with exactly one resource node
of each type
- by default, the process container hierarchy and the resource node
hierarchies are isomorphic, but that can be controlled by userspace.
