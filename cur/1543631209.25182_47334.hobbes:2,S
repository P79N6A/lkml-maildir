I think so. They're also hardlocked in memory which makes life easier.

Given that we're selling a new line of machines based on this now, I'd guess
it'll be 5 years before they're all upgraded. On the other hand, I think they'll
lynch us if Linux doesn't work properly on these type of machines within the
next year ;-) But, yes, I still think it's worth it. Hammer is a great promise, but
it's just not here right now, and I don't think we'll have production level 8-way
and 16-way machines for at least a year ...
