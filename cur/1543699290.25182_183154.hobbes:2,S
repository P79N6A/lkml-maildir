Hi!
I'm using 2.6.0-test11 on a production machine with 4 IDE disks in RAID0
and with xfs over them, and havent got any problems so far.
I thought you might be interested, because there are people who are having
problems with the setup above. If you're interested in my config, or
whatever, let me know, and I'll ship that info, too.
Regards,
