Sure, I can do this.  Wrt to trivial patches, will these patches that go into 
rusty's patch bot go into Linus's tree or into the -mm tree? 
The reason I ask that is because a trivial patch may fix an oops if there's an 
off-by-one problem and typically I'd submit that to the trivial patch bot.
That's why I was wondering about why this tree doesn't except trivial changes.
Thanks,
Shawn.
