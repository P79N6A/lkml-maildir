Probably.
I'm just trying to:
1)  Supplement an unstable "API sort-of-thing" with something
    that's stable and can last.
2)  Come up with a realistic idea that can be implemented, tested,
    and deemed "obviously correct" and "good" in finite time
3)  Not break stuff more than it already is, and allow for a gradual
    transition to something that won't break mysteriously every ten
    kernel releases.
The idea is that if the userland application does it's parsing wrong, it should
either not compile at all, or abort loudly at run-time, instead of getting bad
values "sometimes".
