There's basically no description of what the patch does here.  Patches
which turn up in the middle of an email discussion tend to not get applied.
Normally someone will send a new patch with a reworked description once the
discussion has come to a conclusion.

It's all there in bk somewhere ;)

Did it?
What was the testcase?

Two separate things are happening here.
a) We go all the way to the end of the range even if something went
   wrong partway through.  Why?
b) Remove the was_dirty logic.
   That's there to address the unmap-dirtyied-the-page-and-buffers
   problem described in the above changelog.  If that can happen then this
   patch will end up giving us a page which is marked clean but which in
   fact has dirty buffers.
