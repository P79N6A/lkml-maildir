Subject: [PATCH]  Built-in kernel debugger, version v0.3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

An updated version of the in-kernel debugger patch for linux 2.2.[34]
is now available at:
   
http://reality.sgi.com/slurn_engr/
Version v0.3 contains the following new features/bugfixes:
     * Include symbols from loadable modules in kdb symbol table 
     * Ensure that the register contents (rd command) are correct when 
       switching CPU's with cpu command. 
     * Ignore mouse events (Thanks to Richard Schaal) 
     * Add kdb_unregister function to be called from module cleanup function 
     * Move config entries for kdb to Kernel Hacking category 
     * Remove memory address validity checking in kdbgetword (for now) 
This version of kdb supports dynamic addition of commands 
using the insmod/rmmod module infrastructure.   A module containing
kernel debugger commands should call 'kdb_register' from its init
function to register the commands, and should call 'kdb_unregister'
from the cleanup function when the module is unloaded.   This could
be used, for example, to create a module of file system debugging
commands to display inodes, struct file, vma, buffer header, etc.
