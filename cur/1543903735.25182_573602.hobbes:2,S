Subject: What does irq_canonicalize mean?

I found this function, inside include/asm-i386/irq.h or
include/asm-x86_64/irq.h,
static __inline__ int irq_canonicalize(int irq)
{
	return ((irq == 2) ? 9 : irq);
}
there is no comments,so I am totally confused what does this function
mean, why there is a "2", and why there is a "9"?
Thanks
