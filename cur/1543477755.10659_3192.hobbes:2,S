Yes, if the count is not atomic_t, it could be really disastrous, as the
count might got screwed permanently. This way you.

Thanks, but I don't have a SMP box (unfortunately :).

There is no such way. If you need to use two or more resources atomically,
then you must protect the accesses by some kind of exclusive lock.

there - imagine an interrupt would arrive at the place you describe...
