Well in 64-bit mode it's still very very unstable at least with
the Adaptec dpt 2005/2010/2015 series adapters. Also it doesn't
support 32-bit legacy ioctls and the raidtools package doesn't
compile correctly on 64-bits (it compiles but doesn't work).
The 64-bit version of dpt_i2o that you can get from Adaptec on
request (unfortunately the 64 bit patches aren't in mainline (yet?))
works fine and is rock-stable.
Mike.
