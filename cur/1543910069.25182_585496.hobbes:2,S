I see you haven't got to this yet, probably because I used your old
email address, so to save hassle, here is the final patch and the
description.
Due to inconsistent locking in the VFS between calls to lookup and
revalidate deadlock can occur in the automounter.
The inconsistency is that the directory inode mutex is held for both
lookup and revalidate calls when called via lookup_hash whereas it is
held only for lookup during a path walk. Consequently, if the mutex
is held during a call to revalidate autofs4 can't release the mutex
to callback the daemon as it can't know whether it owns the mutex.
This situation happens when a process tries to create a directory
within an automount and a second process also tries to create the
same directory between the lookup and the mkdir. Since the first
process has dropped the mutex for the daemon callback, the second
process takes it during revalidate leading to deadlock between the
autofs daemon and the second process when the daemon tries to create
the mount point directory.
After spending quite a bit of time trying to resolve this on more than
one occassion, using rather complex and ulgy approaches, it turns out
that just delaying the hashing of the dentry until the create operation
work fine.
