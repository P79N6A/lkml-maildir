This patch addresses the issue with "osize too small" errors in mppe encryption.
The patch fixes the issue with wrong output buffer size being passed to ppp
decompression routine.

As pointed out by Suresh Mahalingam, the issue addressed by 
ppp-fix-osize-too-small-errors-when-decoding patch is not fully resolved yet.
The size of allocated output buffer is correct, however it size passed to
ppp->rcomp->decompress in ppp_generic.c if wrong. The patch fixes that.
