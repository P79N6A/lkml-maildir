Peter's argument was in essence that since using perfmon3 involves some
userspace computation that can be done by proprietary software instead
of a GPL'd library (libpfm), that makes perfmon3 a GPL-circumvention
device.
I was trying to point out that that argument is silly by applying it
to the kernel module loader.  There the userspace component is gcc and
binutils, and the computation they do can be done alternatively by
proprietary software such as icc or xlc.  That of itself doesn't make
the module loader a GPL-circumvention device (though it may be for
other reasons).
And if the argument is silly in that case (which it is), it is even
more silly in the case of perfmon3, where what is being computed and
passed to the kernel is just a few register values, not instructions.

FOSS is about freedom - we don't force anyone to use our code.  If
someone wants to use their own code instead of glibc or libpfm on the
user-space side of the syscall interface, that's fine.
