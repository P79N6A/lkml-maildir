OK, the patch below (which Linus applied to his tree yesterday) should
fix the oopses.
> BIOS EDD facility v0.16 2004-Jun-25, 16 devices found
but the patch to edd.S doesn't resolve that EDD believes you've got 16
devices (I would expect it to report 2, as you have only 2 disks).
Thanks for the quick testing.  Back to the drawing board though for
this second part.
Thanks,
Matt
