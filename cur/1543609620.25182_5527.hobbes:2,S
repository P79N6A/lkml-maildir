Hi
On what systems can Linux support file system block sizes above 4kB? I
read that it's not supported on ia32, so where is it? If I've understood
SCSI systems tuning right, a block size of 256kB would be perfect for the
hardware (see my last email). And - yes - I'm talking about serving large
files :-)
Thanks
roy
