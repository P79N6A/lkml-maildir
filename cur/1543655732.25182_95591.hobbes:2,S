An old, pre-BMDMA, "PCI IDE Controller Specification, rev 1.0, 3/4/94" 
I have here says on page 3, in chapter 2.4, second and third paragraphs say:
--
When a channel is in 'compatibility' mode, the controller can either 
disable the first four Base Address registers (i.e.; make them not 
writable and return 0's when read) or leave them fully programmable. In
either case the values in these registers are ignored as long as the 
channel is in 'compatibility' mode.
When a channel is in compatibility mode the IRQ used by the channel 
must be the 'compatibility' IRQ. PCI interrupt lines must not be effected 
by that channel's interrupt. Conversely, when the channel is in native-PCI 
mode the channel's interrupt should be connected to the appropriate INTx#. 
Compatibility IRQs should not be effected (i.e.; they should be tristated).

We should ignore BARs (and reported INT#) when chip is not in native mode, 
but I'm sure that it breaks something else (note that I do not know any
chip which honors BARs when using compatible mode; only problematic piece
of hardware I know is PDC20265, but this one does not report itself
as IDE hardware, so for this chip we have special cases in the code already;
maybe VIA uses IRQ number specified in PCI config space instead of
14/15?).
