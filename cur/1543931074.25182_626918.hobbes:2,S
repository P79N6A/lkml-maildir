OK, not difficult to try. (This is x86, BTW.) But I'm still baffled as to precisely why it is
hanging. Is it waiting for a value from the PCI bus that never appears, or something? Are there
any other PCI-related tests that I can do to check that the device has been initialised correctly
on the bus, please?

OK, I can build one of those kernels. Before then, I think that hostap was provided as an external
source package.
Cheers,
Chris
