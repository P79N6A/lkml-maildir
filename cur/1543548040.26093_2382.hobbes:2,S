Hmm.. my name is on the to line, so I guess that this is directed
at me too?
I have _no problem_ with Linus not liking/integrating KDB.  I only
suggested that it _could_ improve bug report quality and encourage
folks to try to solve problems if it were integrated.  I also pointed
out that debuggers are readily available for those who want them.
Now (having gotten the last word in) let's stop talking about something
that's _not going to happen_ and chase down bugs so 2.4 _can_ happen :)
