Hmm, I hoped md5sum 30_gig would finish before I finish work to start 
writing new data on tape...

So in my case it just died for some reason (the console didn't unblank; 
the md5sum process should have ended long time ago).
On the other hand, the machine was responding to pings, and the ports 
were open, so it wasn't totally dead.
Hmm, so we can just speculate what it was.
