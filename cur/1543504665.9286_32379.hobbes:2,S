The mapping depends on the order the files are created:
If you create longfilename_a.txt first and longfilename_b.txt second,
then longfi~1.txt=longfilename_a.txt and longfi~2.txt=longfilename_b.txt .
If you create longfilename_b.txt first and longfilename_a.txt second,
then longfi~1.txt=longfilename_b.txt and longfi~2.txt=longfilename_a.txt .
Do a backup without preserving both names and now some programs that rely
on short filenames are hosed.

It puts in both names, but the short name might be wrong if you're
restoring a backup.

I wouldn't mind if the short filenames went away, as long as there were
ioctls so that wine/dosemu/samba/whatever could get at them. I also
wouldn't be surprised if some people did not like such a change...
