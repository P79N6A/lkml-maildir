 In practice it is resources above 0x00ff that really matter here as using 
the motherboard range for device allocation is unsafe anyway (the whole 
range may be actively decoded by the south bridge).  So whatever is 
reported between 0x0000 and 0x00ff is mostly informational; with some 
protection against driver bugs perhaps (that assuming they have got error 
handling right for reservations).  I second it is not worth the hassle.
