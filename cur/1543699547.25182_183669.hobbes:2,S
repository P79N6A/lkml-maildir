I see.  So what about the networking core exporting an [inline] function
that recalculates tso_segs and tso_size (like the 'Hack zone' code
fragment in ip_queue_xmit() right now), called skb_tso_recalc() or
whatever name you prefer.
Or even better (since I assume TSO can only happen with
locally-originated datagrams), why don't we move the tso_size/tso_segs
calculation to happen after the LOCAL_OUT netfilter hook?  This way we
also get the ip_select_ident_more() right, which we couldn't easily
update from the proposed skb_tso_recalc() function.
yes, in that case we would need to have some fake code like
	if (skb->len > mtu && (sk->sk_route_caps&NETIF_F_TSO))
		skb_shinfo(skb)->tso_segs = 1;
in order to make the newly-created check for refragmentation in
conntrack still work.  Alternatively, create some inline function that 
gives a yes/no return if the skb would later become TSO or not.

There are no NAT helper modules as of now that touch the size of the TCP
header.  We have some experimental stuff in patch-o-matic (like
IPV3OPTSSTRIP target), but nothing in the stock kernel.  I will put a
review of those on our TODO list - but for the vanilla kernel there
shouldn't be a problem.

We now don't do that anymore and mangle the SACK options accordingly.
In any way, there is nothing that changes the size of the tcp or udp
header.

good news.
Please get back to me with any comments you might have, thanks.
