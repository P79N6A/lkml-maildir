I enabled CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT.
I still have that latency trace in <idle>-0 with that line at the end.
In fact, it is the most common trace on this system: 
I always get that trace immediately after resetting the latency 
tracer, always close to 9 ms (until an even longer latency happens).
Moreover, I looked up the address shown in asm_do_IRQ in the second
line of all those traces.
<idle>-0     0D..1    1us!: touch_critical_timing (default_idle)
<idle>-0     0D..2 8841us+: asm_do_IRQ (c021da44 1a 0)
It is always the same address, and it is in "cpu_idle".
However, CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT remains silent: No bugs, no warns,
just plain nothing in the syslog.
