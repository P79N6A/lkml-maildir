Anton's Oops showed that kmap_atomic(page, KM_USER0) is sometimes failing to 
return an address, something that we cannot accept in a networking bottom 
half (performance and reliability would suck if we had to delay and retry). 
That indicates that something is calling kmap_atomic() and then getting 
interrupted before it can call kunmap_atomic().
>From what I can see, the only other place where KM_USER0 is employed would be 
in the *_highpage() helper routines in include/linux/highmem.h. These 
routines are used in various places, but are usually not protected against 
(soft and hard) interrupts or kernel pre-emption. Could it be that the latter 
is what is causing trouble?
