Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Couple of I2O sysfs changes

Hi Markus,
I was looking at the users of class_interfaces and stumbled across
I2O subsystem. As far as I understand the purpose of class interfaces
was to provide different 'views' on the hardware, not just to have
a callback to finish initialization of sysfs structures. I think it
woudl be better to remove i2o_device_class_interface and create
user/parent links right after class device registration.
Also, it looks like i2o_device_class itself is not needed - correct
me if I am wrong, but all i2o devics reside on their own bus so
i2o_devices class simply mirrors iformation from the bus and can
also be safely removed.
Please consider applying the 2 pathes below (just compile-tested,
don't have proper hardware).
