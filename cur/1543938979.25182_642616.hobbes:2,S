Subject: [PATCH -mm 0/2] AVR32 PWM driver and example user
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Two patches from David Brownell follow. The first one implements a
low-level driver/library for the PWM controller integrated on some
newer AVR32- and ARM-based chips from Atmel. The second one uses this
library to implement a LED driver with variable brightness.
There's currently no user of this LED driver, but it can be tested on
the ATSTK1000 by following the instructions here:
http://avr32linux.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/AtmelPwmDriver
Also, PWM functionality in the kernel has been requested by several
AVR32 users with custom boards (which we hopefully will see support
for in mainline later), and some AT91-based boards may be able to use
the PWM LED driver by default given some suitable platform- and board
code (David mentioned AT91SAM9263EK.) I'd appreciate some feedback
from AT91 people about this.
