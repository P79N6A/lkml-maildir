In many cases I disagree. Garbage in - garbage out. That goes for
security policy decisions as well as the revenue. The security modules
must get data that is sufficient to make the decision, locked correctly
and with a defined scope and lifespan.
For example passing an ascii path without thought is useless because you
would race name lookups against things like symlinks. The same goes for
audit stuff which is one of the reasons snare needs a lot of work yet
