My ISA I/O board (tsio) driver seems to work well, but there is one
possible problem I foresee.  For a quick functional description, the
board is based on 4 8255 chips 4 * (3 usable i/o ports + 1 control
byte).  Each is assigned it's own node, so I have /dev/tsio0-15 with
minor number representing the offset of each port from io_base.  Here
is tsio_write():
ssize_t tsio_write (struct file *filp, 
                   const char *buf, 
                   size_t count, 
                   loff_t *loff)
{
  unsigned char c = buf [0];
  int offset = MINOR(filp->f_dentry->d_inode->i_rdev);
  get_user (c, buf);
  outb (c, io_base + offset);
#ifdef DEBUG
  printk ("getting user byte %-#12x\n", c);
  printk ("tsio write %-#12x\n", c);
  printk ("offset = %d\n", offset);
#endif
  return 1;
}
The problem is that if two processes try to write to different devices
simultaneously, offset could be set by process 1, then reset by
process 2 before process 1 completes the outb.  Does the kernel handle
this case or should the driver?  What mechanism would the driver use
to handle it.
