Thanks Ralf and Alan,
What if I allocate memory at boot-time using alloc_bootmem*(..)?
Imran.

On every sane platform the hardware performs better at keeping the
coherency than software ever could.  Don't even think about it unless
you for some reason absolutely must disable caching.  Aside and as Alan
already mentioned the allocation of uncached memory isn't supported.
