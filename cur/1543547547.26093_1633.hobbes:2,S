Subject: [PATCH] Magic SysRq help
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

On more than one occasion I have been hit by a situation where I wished
I could remember which Magic SysRq key to use. So I wrote the following
patch: Alt+SysRq+h to print the list of keys, taken from the SysRq
Documentation. I thought I'd share it here, hoping that other people 
would also find it useful. It's against 2.2.16 but probably works on 
many other kernel versions too.
