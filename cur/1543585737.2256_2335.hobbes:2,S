Yes.

get_sb_...() will do get_filesystem() even if superblock stays alive.
We get the filesystem twice, in get_fs_type() and get_sb_...(), but if
we goto 'fail:' and don't call kill_super(), we put the filesystem
only once (near fs_out).

foofs is a FS_SINGLE filesystem: 
(but the !nd.dentry->d_inode case should be no different)
# grep foofs /proc/modules 
foofs                 6736   0 (unused)
# mount NONE /mnt -t foofs
# grep foofs /proc/modules 
foofs                 6736   1
# mount NONE /mnt -t foofs
mount: NONE already mounted or /mnt busy
mount: according to mtab, NONE is already mounted on /mnt
# grep foofs /proc/modules 
foofs                 6736   2
# mount NONE /mnt -t foofs
mount: NONE already mounted or /mnt busy
mount: according to mtab, NONE is already mounted on /mnt
# grep foofs /proc/modules 
foofs                 6736   3
# umount /mnt
# grep foofs /proc/modules 
foofs                 6736   2
# umount /mnt
umount: /mnt: not mounted
# grep foofs /proc/modules 
foofs                 6736   2
# rmmod foofs
foofs: Device or resource busy
