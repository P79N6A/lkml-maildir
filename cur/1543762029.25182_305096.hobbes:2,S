Yes. agreed. But again nothing stops one of the many application
listening on the multicast events from stopping the fork-events.
Even though Guillame's application claims itself the main management
utility, nothing stops another application from assuming the management
role.
I think if the the connector infrastructure provides a administrative
kind of channel, (the one I mentioned in the reply to Guillame) that
should help get better control on the management aspects of the
event stream.
