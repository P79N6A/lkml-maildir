So, I have two question now, 
1. how to determine whether your kernel support SMP?
    Somebody taugh me that you can type  "uname -r", but it seems not
correct.
2. I remember in 2.2.x, when I rebuild the kernel which support SMP, the
compile
    argument will include -D__SMP__ , but this time, when I rebuild kernel
2.4.2-2 , it didn't  appear.
    Why? 
Anyway, thanks for  Vivek's answer.

This is just the label as defined by the entries in the top-level
Makefile, eg:
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 4
SUBLEVEL = 3
EXTRAVERSION = -ac5

You can edit the extraversion value if you want to label your smp kernels
differently, but you don't have to.
You'll probably find you _have_ compiled an SMP kernel - see what
/proc/cpuinfo says, for example.
