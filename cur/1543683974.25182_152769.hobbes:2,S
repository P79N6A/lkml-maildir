The errors below have been there for as long as I can remember, even
under 2.4. The binfmt_misc folder in proc is empty on boot, even though
I have the binfmt_misc module in the kernel (I think it didn't work
builtin as well, but I haven't tested recently).

/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register: No such file or directory
Jul 29 18:26:13 cobra wine: /etc/rc5.d/S98wine: line 17:
/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register: No such file or directory
So what's wrong? Is this a kernel issue.. I thought it probably is.
Or have I made a mistake somewhere...
