If above_background_load() were implemented inside sched.c instead of in 
sched.h there would be no need to export weighted_cpuload() would there? 
  This would allow weighted_cpuload() to be inline and the efficiency 
would be better as above_background_load() doesn't gain a lot by being 
inline as having weighted_cpulpad() non inline means that it's doing a 
function call several times in a loop i.e. it may save one function call 
by being inline but requires (up to) one function call for every CPU.
The other way around the cost would be just one function call.
