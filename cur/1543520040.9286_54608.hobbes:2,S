You are missing the point here. Just because your board runs
ok doesn't mean that you can dismiss everyone who has reported
a problem as technically imcompetent. Say half the reports are
due to incompetent owners - that still leaves a large number
of real problems. And remember, a lot of the s/w running on
these boards doesn't report the error, eg. NT, pre 2.3 Linux.
What we don't know is, are occasional APIC errors 'normal',
or is it a sign that something is not right with the board.
