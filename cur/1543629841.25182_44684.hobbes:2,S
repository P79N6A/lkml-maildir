Subject: [PATCH] Completely honor prctl(PR_SET_KEEPCAPS, 1)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Originally when a process set*uided all capabilities bits were cleared.  
Then sometime later (wish BK went back 3 years), the behaviour was
modified according to the comment "A process may, via prctl(), elect to
keep its capabilites when it calls setuid() and switches away from
uid==0. Both permitted and effective sets will be retained."
The current behavior/implementation doesn't match the comment. Only 
permitted capabilities are retained.
This patch against 2.4.18-3 (RHL7.3 kernel, should apply against stock)  
fixes it.  Now both permitted and effective capabilities are retained.
