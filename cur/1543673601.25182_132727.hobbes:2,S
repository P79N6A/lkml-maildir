Hi. Are you sure you didn't just get the IC7 instead of the IC7-G?
That's the only difference between the boards and the description
sort of describes the IC7. Check for markings on the board and
on the box and if you indeed have gotten an IC7 (but paid for the -G)
then complain to the people that sold it to you.
