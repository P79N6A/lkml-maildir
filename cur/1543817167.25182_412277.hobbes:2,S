It looks page caches in this array is hold by pipe until data is consumed.
So..this page cannot be reclaimd or migrated and hot-removed :).
I don't know about sendfile() but this looks client can hold server's memory,
when server uses sendfile() 64k/conn.
Is there a way to force these pages to be freed ? or page reclaimer can
know this page is held by splice ? (we need additional PG_flags to do this ?)
I think these pages are necessary to be held only when data in them is used.
