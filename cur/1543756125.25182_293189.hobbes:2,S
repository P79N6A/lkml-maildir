Did you check that issuing the POLL command in the middle of a mouse
packet does indeed reset the counter of the streaming mode? I'd expect
them to be separate, at least on some mice, if POLL is handled as a
normal mouse command, and after the three bytes from POLL are sent, the
mouse could just continue sending the packet like with any other
command.
