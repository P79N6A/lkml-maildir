Well the first thing I checked was vanilla 2.4.5, and I managed to
bring that down hard too. It has nothing at all to do with reiserfs,
but may be related to USB instead. I have been able to reproduce the
problem by doing the following:
a) Booting with X on vc/2
b) Logging into vc/6 instead
c) Mounting a filesystem on my USB Zip drive
d) Unmounting the filesystem again
e) Unmounting the NFS mount
f) Executing "rmmod -a" twice to clean out the now-unused modules
(e.g. sd_mod, scsi_mod, usb-storage)
g) Trying to switch back to vc/2
h) Oops!
2.4.4 seems OK; I guess I'll have to build those -pre kernels now.
