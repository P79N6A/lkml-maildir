It might be, depending on what the problem is. E.g. timeout might still mean the
card processed the command and will start sending data.
Anyway, CRC errors should be extremely rare so I'd guess that either the card or
the controller has gotten confused. In many cases the card will shut down when
it gets annoyed, so that might be what you're seeing here.
Other than that, I'm not sure I can help that much. The stop commands should
never wedge the card, so that isn't the issue (unless the card is buggy).
