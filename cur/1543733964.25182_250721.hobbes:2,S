That seems rather confusing. We must special-case for !CONFIG_MMU
anyway because field IDs are tied to meaning, i.e. systems export
different sets of fields depending on this configuration setting. The
proc filesystem does the same, the difference is that a changing set
is easier to handle with nproc.
