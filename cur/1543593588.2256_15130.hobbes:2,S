Hi,
Changes:
- merge 2.4.6-pre1 zone changes for zone-dma32-6
- correct qlogicfc can_dma_32 flag (Arjan van de Ven)
Arjan also reported that the kernel doesn't boot on a machine with 8GB
of RAM, I'm suspecting the zone-dma32-6 changes. If someone has access
to such a machine, please try it.
There are no bug fixes in this release either - apart from the above
problem, no known bugs exists. I'll be donating a virtual beer for the
first spotted bug.
The patch can be considered stable, it's received quite a bit of testing
on highend hardware. Here's a plug from one such tester:
"Regarding performance of this patch, it is providing us with the highest
aggregate throughput for reads of any of the recent kernels for multiple
IOs - up to 185MB/s continuous through both controllers :)"
