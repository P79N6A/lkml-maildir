Scripts, run by root, which are then given the wrong output file? Does
happen... Linus himself fried a partition table by dialing /dev/hda once ;-)

Never heard of anything like that happening. Or an accidental buffer
overflow reflashing a BIOS, or the SCSI controller's BIOS, or anything like
that. The real (much more frequent, that is) problems are quite mundane:
Overflows/following the wrong pointer inside the kernel has scribbled over
the disk and forced two or three complete reinstalls here during 2.3, core
files generated by overflows have clogged / on occasion, 2.4.0-testX NFS
doesn't work right with Red Hat 6.2 init scripts/programs (nfslock
complains and doesn't start, and running NFS this way screws up Solaris 2.6
machines serving files so they have to be rebooted), a couple of CDs I've
got give SCSI I/O errors on my SS4, and from then on more and more
processes freeze until in some 2 minutes the machine is dead. Those are
problems that do matter to me, not a theoretical way to kill a disk, given
that there are literally thousands of ways of doing so already.
