They are to reading like gaps in a road.
If you really need to keep unused code for reference
just do it in your LOCAL repository.
There are exceptions where you remove the last user of code 
in one patch and a different developer just needs this code
for his new stuff in another patch.
In this case an #if 0/#endif is quite common to reduce merging
conflicts.
