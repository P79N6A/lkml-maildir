Ok, I _am_ using the nVidia modules (on 2.4.21) but the fact that the agpgart 
driver can't sense my agp apature size is concerning... (its set to 256MB in 
the bios)

I'm running a GeForce FX 5600 128Mb with AGP 3.0 support enabled.
It seems to run ok, but its slower than the Ti 4200-4x I took out by a larger 
margin than it really should be (according to the benchmarks I've seen 
scattered through the internet.)
I'm also running with the Local APIC turned on (it doesnt seem to break 
anything).
Is anything actually broken or is this nothing to worry about?
Cheers,
Mark.
