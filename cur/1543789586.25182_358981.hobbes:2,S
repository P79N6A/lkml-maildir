   BTW, the reason 16MB fails is this test in __alloc_bootmem_core():
     if (bdata->last_success >= preferred)
            preferred = bdata->last_success;
That pretty much negates most of usefulness of passing in a goal other
than 0 or !0.  If I comment out this test, the 16MB goal works as
expected, but I get an uninitialized timer in the sym53c8xx driver.  Not
sure what's happening there, but apparently the test has some purpose
other than optimization.  Thanks,
