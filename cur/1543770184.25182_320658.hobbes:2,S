Unfortunately, I noticed that the ramdisk driver has to be compiled in (I
didn't try w/o initrd support).  Atleast I dropped ext2 from my compiled in
list (NO filesystems in my kernel!)
Now it would be nice if I could remove rd from the compiled in list as well
(even thought it would only save a few K)
