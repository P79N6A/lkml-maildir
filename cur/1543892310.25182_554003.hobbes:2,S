Well I'm too busy/lazy to reboot at the moment, but I've reproduced
this behavior with the following:
watchdelta.py:
import time
last = time.time()
while 1:
    t = time.time()
    delta = t - last
    if delta > .5:
        print delta
    last = t
$ nice -n 20 python watchdelta.py

At load=1 (the first several lines), this prints out messages
sporadically. At higher loads, every iteration is a >.5s delay. So
it's probably not particular to lguest at all.
