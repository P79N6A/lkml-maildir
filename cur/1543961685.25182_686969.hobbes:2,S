I suspect that something wrong happened on your compilation, or at linux-next
merge. Those three drivers (tea5767, tea5761 and tea829x) were moved
from /drivers/media/video to /drivers/common/tuners, but the above messages are
pointing to the old path.

Just for the records: Signed-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@infradead.org>
