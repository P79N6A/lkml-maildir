Hi all:)
I'm trying to make a Vela scsi decoder be recognized as a generic scsi
device under RH 5.2 (2.0.36)
The Vela card comes up as a device type 12.
<quick description of symptom>
I've modified drivers/scsi/scsi.c enough to have the card recognized, and
not simply reject it as an unknown device type.
I added it's device type to sg.c as a legitimate type.
But it still isn't coming up as /dev/sga:(
Any general pointers?

The ==> is from my modification
Obviously I've not quite figured out how to make sg_ attach to the deice:(
Here's a list of all I've done.
So far I've:
changed MAX_SCSI_DEVICE_CODE in drivers/scsi/scsi.h to 13
#def'd TYPE_VELA as 12 in scsi.c
updated the scsi_device_types table in scsi.c to include two
	"filler" slots and  "VELA MPEG DECODER" in the 13'th slot
and added it to: (scsi.c again)
 switch (type = (scsi_result[0] & 0x1f)) {
  case TYPE_TAPE:
  case TYPE_DISK:
  case TYPE_MOD:
  case TYPE_PROCESSOR:
  case TYPE_SCANNER:
  case TYPE_MEDIUM_CHANGER:
  case TYPE_VELA:
and added it to:
      /*
         * sd and sr drivers allocate scatterlists.
         * sr drivers may allocate for each command 1x2048 or 2x1024 extra
         * buffers for 2k sector size and 1k fs.
         * sg driver allocates buffers < 4k.
         * st driver does not need buffers from the dma pool.
         * estimate 4k buffer/command for devices of unknown type (should
panic).
         */
        if (SDpnt->type == TYPE_WORM || SDpnt->type == TYPE_ROM ||
                 SDpnt->type == TYPE_VELA ||
            SDpnt->type == TYPE_DISK || SDpnt->type == TYPE_MOD) {
            new_dma_sectors += ((host->sg_tablesize *
                                 sizeof(struct scatterlist) + 511) >> 9) *
                               SDpnt->queue_depth;
            if (SDpnt->type == TYPE_WORM || SDpnt->type == TYPE_ROM)
                new_dma_sectors += (2048 >> 9) * SDpnt->queue_depth;
        }
In sg.c I added TYPE_VELA to:
static int sg_detect(Scsi_Device * SDp){
    switch (SDp->type) {
        case TYPE_DISK:
        case TYPE_VELA:
        case TYPE_MOD:
        case TYPE_ROM:
        case TYPE_WORM:
        case TYPE_TAPE: break;
        default:
        printk("Detected scsi generic sg%c at scsi%d, channel %d, id %d,
lun %d\n",
           'a'+sg_template.dev_noticed,
           SDp->host->host_no, SDp->channel, SDp->id, SDp->lun);
    }
    sg_template.dev_noticed++;
    return 1;
