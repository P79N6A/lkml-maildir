Sound modules don't autoload - when you start what? I noticed a strange
thing too - when I start a light window-manager, like lfwm or fvwm2 and
THEN start, say, kmix - modules do get loaded, however, if I try starting
kde with sounds configured when the modules are NOT loaded, it complains
'no sound device available', and the modules don't get loaded. However, if
I then start kmix or smth - modules do get loaded and sound is ok. Are you
observing smth similar? If your modules don't get autoloaded ever... Well,
did you check depmod -ea? What kernel version? Sorry, can't help more so
far... Looks like you are using OSS drivers. Did you ever try ALSA? I had
problems, when I tried ALSA after OSS and then switched back - are all
your /dev-ices with char-major 14 ok?
Also, I think, it happens that some modules just can't be forced to
autoload with some kernel versions...
