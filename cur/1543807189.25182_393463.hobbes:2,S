My buildit26 script does a make oldconfig at the end of the tree build. 
Then my makeit script is run after I've run a make xconfig to dbl check 
the config, so menuconfig never gets involved 99.9% of the time.  
Anyway, its still running, and the log looks 100% normal so far.

People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
