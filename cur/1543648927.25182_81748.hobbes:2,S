And the task-specific fixmap entry would point to a page that makes the normal
system call?

Because its system calls are much slower than the host's.  It would benefit
more from vsyscalls.

And so much slower.

I don't plan on using ptrace forever.  That overhead is going to shrink, and
vsyscalls are one way to make it shrink.
I intend to make UML perform by grabbing whatever improvements from wherever
I can get them, and if I can't get vsyscalls because they're not virtualizable,
then, from my point of view, their design is broken.
