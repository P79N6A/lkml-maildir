Well, I think 64K is probably too large for a generic Linux config, but
16K is a lot more reasonable and would also nicely cut out most other
higher order allocations too.
The efficiency argument has always been there and is nothing new. Yeah,
I know it can be slightly more efficient to do most hardware operations
in larger chunks, and I didn't ever buy it before or now. Superpages can
also be used to use TLBs more efficiently sometimes, etc etc. This is
coming up now because of some specific big problems that are being
encountered which is absolutely not some fundamental hardware limit we
are seeing approach.
