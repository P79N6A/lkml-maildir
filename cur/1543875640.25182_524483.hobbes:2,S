I agree, I was only saying a option to override this check, for users who know that this is not the case.

Thanks a lot, it would take a lot of time to find that out to me,

This sounds great, where is it ? .... :-)
This will improve linux suspend to ram/disk a lot.

Big thanks, maybe usb stick I am going to buy will work with suspend to ram....

Hi,
	Thanks a lot for so quick reply,
	I want to note to myself that making a assumptions generally a bad idea,
	Until now I thought that linux always unplugs/re plugs usb devices on suspend/resume,
	that this is normal, but it looks that linux is better... :-)
	Best regards,
		Maxim Levitsky
