CFS naturally enforces cross-CPU fairness anyway, as Ingo demonstrated. 
Lowering the local CPU parameters should cause system-wide fairness to converge 
faster.  It might be worthwhile to create a more explicit knob for this, but I'm 
inclined to believe we could do it in much less than 700 lines.  Ingo's 
one-liner to improve the 10/8 balancing case, and the resulting improvement, 
were exactly what I was saying should be possible and desirable.  TCP Nagle 
aside, it generally shouldn't take 700 lines of code to speed up the rate of 
convergence of something that already converges.
Until now I've been watching the scheduler rewrite from the sidelines, but I'm 
digging into it now.  I'll try to give some more constructive criticism soon.
