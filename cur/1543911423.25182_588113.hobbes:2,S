We should probably keep it that way. I don't see why anybody should be
using __setup_param directly anyway, so this becomes a nice build-time
error to flag such errant usage :-)
Seriously speaking, though, we should probably just get rid of that
wrong line. It's just an init.h-internal macro to be used by early_param
and __setup, and because those are themselves empty when MODULE, there's
no issues in removing the (unused, broken) __setup_param either.
