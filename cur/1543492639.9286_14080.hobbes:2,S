hi,
I have a 13G Western digital IDE hard disk.
From what I read after I purchased the disk is that both the OS and the BIOS
should have support to support disks > 8G.
Does Linux have support for > 8G.
will fdisk in Linux partition disks > 8G.
Thanks in advance,
-)Bala.
P.S. I don't know if this is the appropriate mailing list, if this is the
wrong one pls. give me a pointer to the appropriate one.
