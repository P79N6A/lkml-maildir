Here is a small patchlet.
It is possible tasks were getting more sleep_avg credit on requeuing than they 
could burn off while running so I've removed the on runqueue bonus to 
requeuing task. 
Note this applies onto O16.3 or 2.6.0-test3-mm3 as O17 was dropped.
This patch is also available here along with a patch against 2.6.0-test3:
