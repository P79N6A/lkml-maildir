Ever heard about bound checking ?

At least, you can use libsafe on x86 machine.

search for libsafe on freshmeat.

yes, and non executable stack is really *not* a part of theses layer.

Now you're suggesting that people involving in some threads on lkml
are saying bullshit and do not know what they are talking about;
i've not seen any piece of code from you nor kernel nor user space...
i don't care, but if you think that what was said in such thread
is bullshit :

Or you didn't read the good thread
or you're simply an idiot.

That's not the problem,
non exec stack wasn't accepted because it give a false sence of security.

Yes, and bloat the kernel code, which is really the last thing to do.

     It is well known that M$ products don't call free() after a malloc().
     The Unix community wish them good luck for their future developments.
