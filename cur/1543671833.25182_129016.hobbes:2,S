This might also help highlight files that are not really in a natural
place in the tree. If people building for x86 platforms start finding
they need a file that is in the sparc part of the tree then that
suggests that said file is probably at least partly non-arch
specific. This would also apply to, say, the audio and video parts of
the drivers section of the tree.
While these things do get reported on here occasionally, and fixed,
making it possible to wholesale remove parts of the tree that people
naturally assume you *shouldn't* need for a particular config ought to
show these up more easily.
Of course it adds another variable into the mix when people report
build problems....
