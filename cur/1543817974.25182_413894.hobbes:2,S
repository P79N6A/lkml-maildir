Works well on my test machines - HP rx2600 and HP cx2600. Hopefully
others can test it on other machines.

This funtion terminates any outstanding interrupts. I found it to be
necessary for devices that use level interrupt. If a device, using level
interrupt, asserted its interrupt as kernel goes into panic, nobody
acknowledges its interrupt. As a result, this interrupt stays asserted
as the new kernel comes up. All drivers in their initialization routine
should clear any pending interrupts, but most do not. As a result, when
driver attempts to use the interrupt, it is unable to since the
interrupt was already asserted and any new interrupts from the device
simply cause interrupt line to continue to be asserted. terminate_irqs()
tries to acknowledge any pending interrupts so the interrupts will be
usable when the new kernel comes up. This is not specific to ia64 and I
would think this problem would show up on other architectures as well. I
happened to find it on ia64 because HP rx2600 uses level interrupts for
SCSI controller.
