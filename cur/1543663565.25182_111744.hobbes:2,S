The apeture is now set correctly. The ATI 4.2.0-2.5.1 drivers don't work but I 
think that is a dri problem. Everything works fine with the vesa drivers using XFree86 4.2.99.

	Done, also fixed warnings from previous patch, and what is most important 
fixed page locking, no more segmantation faults when unloading drm module.
All test for previous patch passed for this one too, except i've now tested it 
with GA-7VRX (KT333) too.
BTW code is backported from 2.5.62.
