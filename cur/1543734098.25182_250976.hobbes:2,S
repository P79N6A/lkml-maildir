It _does_ require initialization. And no, there is no difference between a 
"real" head and a entry "link" in the list. They both need to be 
initialized.

This one is ok without initialzing the entry, since it will do so itself.

This one is NOT ok. If list_del() is ever done on a link entry that hasn't 
been initialized, you crash. If "list_del()" is ever done twice on an 
entry, you will crash and/or corrupt memory elsewhere.

It's not "all safe". You had better explain _why_ it's safe. You do so 
later:

Good. _This_ is what I was after.

No, but it leaves _itself_ invalid. There had better not be anything that 
touches it ever after without an initialization. That wasn't obvious...
