Subject: [PATCH] Wrong errno out of memory in open syscall
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Running under very tight memory conditions, I've been getting a strange
EACCES returned by open(...) - strange because it's called as root, the
file exists and isn't immutable. The only point in execution I can see
where this can be returned is in ext2_lookup. As far as I can tell,
iget(...) returns NULL when it can't allocate pages for an inode, but
ext2_lookup takes this as a permissions problem.
It's a simple one line patch, below.
