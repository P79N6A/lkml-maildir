It does support compression now.  That part was finished, erm, about two
weeks ago.
Logfs on Smartmedia format (I assume most CompactFlash, USB, SD and MMC
media use that) will currently cause a nasty interaction.  Unlike JFFS2,
logfs will alternately write to several eraseblocks.  On real flash,
alternating between half-finished blocks is free.
Smartmedia standard requires to finish the last block before moving to
the next.  So the logfs write pattern will cause it to add an
erase/write overhead of - depending on erase size and compression - 4x
to 512x.  Pretty bad.
If Smartmedia was really stupid, there would be no overhead at all.  Any
manucaturers listening should seriously think about allowing raw flash
access to their devices. ;)
