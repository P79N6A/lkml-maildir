On the subject of write barriers... such a setup probably should have
a serial number field for each write barrier command, and a "WAIT FOR
WRITE BARRIER NUMBER #" command -- which will wait until all writes
preceeding the specified write barrier has been committed to stable
storage.  It might also be worthwhile to have the equivalent
nonblocking operation -- QUERY LAST WRITE BARRIER COMMITTED.
