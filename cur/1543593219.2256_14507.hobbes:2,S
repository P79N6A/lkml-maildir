Well since its not part of the standard or -ac kernel tree I can't evaluate
other solutions. I think the ARM folks can deal with the question when they
reach it

OHCI is specified for PCI. It is specified in terms of PCI config registers
in part. It could be that the code needs to have $CONFIG_PCI on the dep
rules for OHCI and UHCI and the ARM driver be seperate. When the ARM stuff is
merged its worth working out.
