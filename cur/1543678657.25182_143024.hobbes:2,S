Hello!
After compiling xfs on alpha i have one unresolved symbol:
/lib/modules/2.5.73-0.2/kernel/fs/xfs/xfs.ko needs unknown symbol
files_stat
At ia32 this problem is not exist.
I think that problem with xfs was earlier than 2.5.73, becouse 2.5.72
have it too (i've not tested older kernels).
Cheers
