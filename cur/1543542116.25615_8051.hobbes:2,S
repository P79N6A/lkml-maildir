Sorry, terminology was a bit unclear. I was thinking of a user level
thread, where many could be mapped to a kernel "scheduling entity". iirc 
UnixWare creates such a thing and they were surely measuring that.
It certainly doesn't need a kernel stack, but as Tigran noted has some other 
cost, e.g. in select() and signal handling. 
I think it would be possible to get the best of both (give up the kernel
stack when you're in poll or sigtimedwait). It still would be a bit more
costly at thread creation time.

IMHO these applications should use cooperative threading and save themself 
a lot of locking work and wasted brain cycles in the programmer's brain ... @)

The SGI scheduler patch fixes that iirc, just unfortunately it didn't get
merged :-/ Looks like it is an degenerated case of the fast path concept
(or is it less costly than manipulating a few counters/pointers during
the scheduler operations -- I don't know) 
There is other stuff like this, e.g. the loadavg computation in the timer tick.
