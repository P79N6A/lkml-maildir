actually, affinity still works just fine, users can bind tasks to logical
CPUs as well. What i meant was the affinity logic of the scheduler (ie.  
affinity decisions done by the scheduler), not the externally visible
affinity API.

i dont assume that. There's also a fair amount of code in the kernel that
relies on binding threads to particular CPUs, the patch does not break
that in any way.
