I don't have any HighPoint controllers here, but I did spot a bug in 
the patch that's easy to fix:

This isn't correct on current Athlon and P4 machines running kernels 
compiled for i686.  One approach is to only set the cache line size if 
the bios set it to something less than we expect it to, or to leave 
this kind of pci hackery to the generic pci layer.  It's important to
note that quite a few drivers share this bug at present.  Cheers,
