Richard,
We are looking at this from the M$GARBAGE side of the world.  The
problem is related to Microsoft's implementation of DHCP and whether or
not you have a Microsoft DHCP or WINS server on your network,  The data
being returned to Linux is causing severe network problems, incluing
DHCP broadcast storms.  Caldera's LIZARD utility gets into a state
whereby it starts flooding the network with DHCP broadcasts that will
crash local and remote networks (we have brought down our T1 with US
WEST twice this week).  I am running TCPDUMP and trapping the garbage
packets so we can determine why Linux is doing this.  This looks like a
Linux problem, since Linux is the one trashing the network and
generating the Broadcast storms.  Andy Bradford and Mark Oberg at
Caldera are looking at this right now with us.  I'll update the list
when we find out why Linux and Windows NT DHCP don't play well together.
We have also seen the ICMP problem as well, and both appear to be
related to a Linux server asking a Microsoft DHCP server for an
address.  I will post the TCPDUMP file to whomever owns this problem in
Linux.
