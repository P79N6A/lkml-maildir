The epoll API is deficient--it is subtly error prone and it forces work 
on user space that is better done in the kernel.  That the API is 
specified in a deficient way does not make it any less deficient.
Again, there is no rational justification for the kernel to not test the 
condition upon registration.  There is ample justification for it to do so.
