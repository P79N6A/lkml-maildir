Hi
I've just completed a kernel driver for the infra red remote control which
is supplied with the Illusion Hardware DVD decoder.  I believe it to be
the same unit that RealMagic supply.  (It's detector plugs in to the game
port).
The source and driver can be found at
http://www.defaid.demon.co.uk/linux/ir_remote/
It also includes a diff file for a patch to Mike Oliphant's grip/gcd to
allow it to use the remote.  It's a bit rough and ready but it works.
Any comments would be appreciated.
Melanie
