After the well-deserved sleep, would you (or Leonard) care to share the tip?
I've been involved in (fortunately, not responsible for) a situation where
attempt to extend a hardware raid set led into state where be had to
reformat the whole system and restore all from backups (what backups we
had). I wonder if that piece of information would have been applicable.
And I do wish to express my respect for the hard work you are doing on
kernel.org.
