Yes, that's exactly what this patch meant to prevent. That no use of
this platform driver in vanilla kernel doesn't mean the check is
unnecessary. Actually, from the code of this driver, the platform_data
is mandatory for the driver to work properly.  Well, if an oops is
on purpose when platform_data == NULL, this is, I agree, completely
unnecessary.
