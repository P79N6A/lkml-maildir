EGCS 1.1.1 does a better job of strength reduction in general;
previously we would create many artificially independant induction 
variables.  It has nothing to do with S_R_C except that they are
most likely to lose.
However: on x86 scaled index addressing is nearly free, and if use
can be made of it, we may be able to save registers.
