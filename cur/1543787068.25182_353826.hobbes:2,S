Let's not exaggerate, I've not suggested dropping VMA entirely.
It's just that UML is a workload suffering for the tree lookup, and Ulrich 
Drepper found another case where the tree lookup was a problem.
I also thought to the lookup function in itself, but I've no easy road to go 
(I've been thinking to radix trees, but they can be way worse on 64bit with 
many little mappings) and that is even more invasive (though it would 
theoretically be a cleaner solution).

For instance, replacing PROT_NONE vmas, which are inserted just to prevent 
mappings in those areas (which must be instead left as guard pages), with 
simple PROT_NONE ptes, is fairly simple.

? Not understood this part, ignoring it?
Maybe you mean "except one arch, x86_64, which supports exec protection?"

Yes, I see your point. Using VM_READ, especially, is often unneeded (I think 
we don't do "executable, not readable" or "writable, not readable"). I've now 
simplified the handling for the arches, allowing them to be changed much 
less.
However, I think it's better to leave the generic code as-is, while extending 
the wrapper, to pass VM_READ too. So, only archs wanting to do execute 
protection, or to support strange things as "write allowed, read disallowed", 
will need to use access_mask.

Exactly... I don't like it, even because it would disallow using 
r_f_p(PROT_NONE) in place of PROT_NONE vma for guard pages.

That is not an optimization, but a breakage, for the case where I have (say) a 
readable mapping, but a PROT_NONE page in it. I know because I've hit this 
problem with my testprogram.
Unless you use the "minimum prots" ideas, or there is something I'm missing in 
ia64 (it seems not - and IIRC it supports branch prediction hints from the 
compiler).

Don't worry for that, and I really appreciate your review on my first VM work. 
Thanks a lot!
