Hi Greg, Just letting you know this is resolved in 2.5. Also, the USB
controller onboard is 1.1.

Ouch.  Watch out when using a hub.  They generally want 1.1 support.

Do you only have a USB keyboard, and no PS2 keyboard attached?
Is the "Enable USB legacy" stuff enabled in your bios?
Does things work better if you load the usb host controller for your
machine?
