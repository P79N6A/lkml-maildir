Well, nowadays, most system have only flash because ROM does not enable
to do firmware upgrade. Second, putting it in the kernel or as a
separate flash section or in an initrd does not change the problem :
something has to be stored on non volatile memory whereas you do not
need that for devfs (except devfs code itself of course) but then you
have udev instead of devfs...

Nothing in /dev but with initramfs. Same cost...
