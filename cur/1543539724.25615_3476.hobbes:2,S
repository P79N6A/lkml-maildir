No. You're not supposed to get CRC errors with UDMA. Not a single one.
If you do, it'd mean you'd get data corruption without the CRCs.
MWDMA/16 runs at the same speed as UDMA/16 and doesn't have CRC
protection. Many people are using MWDMA/16. If your expectations (there
will be a bit error now and then) were true, many people would see
filesystem corruption.
