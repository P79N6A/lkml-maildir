Subject: [patch] remove weird pmd cast
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I don't know what this is trying to do.  It might be some kind of
artifact from when get_pgd_slow() was removed. 
The expanded expression with __pa() ends up looking something like this:
	(unsigned long)(u64)(u32)pmd-PAGE_OFFSET
and that is just nutty because pmd is a pointer now, anyway.
Attached patch removes the casts.
