Fix section mismatch in the Adaptec DPT SCSI Raid driver.
WARNING: vmlinux.o(.init.text+0x1fcd2): Section mismatch:
	reference to .exit.text:adpt_exit (between 'adpt_init' and 'ahc_linux_init')
This warning is due to adaptec device detection calling the exit routine
on failure to properly register the adaptec device.
The exit routine + call was added on July 30 by
