For the case of the cork'ed packet being at the beginning of the connection
(as http/1.0) then cork will not help much, because quickack will send an
ack immediately, but the write only occurs after the process got woken up.
For later cases it depends on the ack state -- 2.4 added more complicated
ack state (e.g "pingpong mode") to fix a few performance problems with the 
normal delack in uncommon situations.  In pingpong mode ack happens very
quickly, too fast for cork. 
I suspect at least persistent HTTP will be always affected by one of these
and generate more acks.
