This references its second argument twice, which can cause correctness
or efficiency problems.
There is no reason that this had to be implemented in cpp. 
Implementing it in C will fix the above problem.
To the reader of the code, a call to cnt32_to_63() looks exactly like a
plain old function call.  Hiding the instantiation of the state storage
inside this macro misleads the reader and hence is bad practice.  This
is one of the reasons why the management of that state should be
performed by the caller and made explicit.
I cannot think of any other cases in the kernel where this trick of
instantiating static storage at a macro expansion site is performed. 
It is unusual.  It will surprise readers.  Surprising readers is
undesirable.
