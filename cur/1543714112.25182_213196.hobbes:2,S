New in this version by popular demand:
- name change kpatchup -> ketchup
- automatic signature verification
- works with older versions of Python
Currently it defaults to trying to use gpg, which means you must have
gpg installed and the appropriate keys in your keyring. You can
disable this with the -g or --no-gpg options.
