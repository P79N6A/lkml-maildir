Right.

Specifically in the fake numa case, we want to make sure that we don't
carve fake nodes that only have IO holes in it.  Unlike the real NUMA
case, here we don't have SRAT etc. to know the memory layout beforehand.

The functions like splti_nodes_equal etc. can be abstracted out to arch
independent part.  I think the only API it needs from arch dependent
part is to find out how much real RAM is present in range without have
to first do add_active_range.
Though as a first step, let us fix the x86_64 (as it doesn't boot when
you have sizeable chunk of IO hole and nodes > 4).
I'm also not sure if other archs actually want to have this
functionality.

Are you saying first let the system find out real numa topology and then
build fake numa on top of it?
