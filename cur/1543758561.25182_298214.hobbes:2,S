It's probably a clash between the PCI updates and the PCMCIA updates.
The PCI updates change the prototype of a helper function for 
pci_bus_alloc_resource(), but don't touch the actual helper function
in PCMCIA.
This means that the PCI update is actually broken - if it's merged as
is into Linus' tree, PCMCIA will break there as well.
Can whoever did the PCI update please resolve this mismatch.  Moreover,
if 2.6.11 appears, please do not merge the PCI updates until this has
been resolved.  Thanks.
