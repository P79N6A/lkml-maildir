int kgdbeth_event(struct notifier_block * self, unsigned long val,
void * data)
{
        if (strcmp(((struct net_device *)data)->name, "eth0")) {
                goto out;
        }
        if (val!= NETDEV_UP)
                goto out;
Do I read it correctly as "eth0 is not to be used for debugging"? So
if I only have eth0 here, I have to comment it out, right?
