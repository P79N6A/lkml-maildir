 Sorry, this was an error on my part, I shouldn't reply to Richard's
posts until I've calmed down.

 Apart from this mailing list, not AFAIK.

 The last part of the path is still part of the follow_link, and thus
subject to the non-total link_count value. The only times you get the
bigger value is...
/a     -> /b/c
/b     -> /b.1     -> /b.2     -> /b.3     -> /b.4
/b.4/c -> /b.4/c.1 -> /b.4/c.2 -> /b.4/c.3 -> /b.4/c.4
...here you can open /a even if you'll follow more than ->link_count
links.
