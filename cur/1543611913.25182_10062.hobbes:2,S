No, it's not.  
Nobody wishes more than me that this had been possible, as the
parallel CML2 rulebase has been an energy sink you wouldn't believe --
it has eaten more of my time than any other single project I've been
involved with in the last two years.
Unfortunately, the syntax of CML1 is rebarbative, and its imperative 
semantics cannot be mechanically translated to CML2's declarative 
semantics by any means I'm aware of.

That's a different issue.  The CML2 rulebase does produce behavior 
substantially like that of the CML1 rulebase in most respects.  There
are divergences due to the single-apex tree, but nothing that has caused
any of the beta testers a problem.  I sweated blood to make it so.
