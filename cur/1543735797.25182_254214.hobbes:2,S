You can't count on library. On 32-bit only system, noone will debug
the library. Then 64-bit extensions came. 64-bit kernel has to be
binary compatible with 32-bit applications.

Well, you also get nasty sideeffects by simply catting the
file. ioctl() does not solve entire 32/64 bit problem, but it at least
makes the problem solvable.
