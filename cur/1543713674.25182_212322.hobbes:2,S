C is a high level language. If you don't like it, use C++, Perl, Ruby, TCL,
Guile, Common LISP, PostScript, ... It's userspace, program in whatever you
like most.

Yep.

Again.... use something written in C, Perl, Common LISP, even COBOL to
parse the description and generate a binary blob from it that you then
stuff into the kernel. No in-kernel runtime for high-level general purpose
languages needed at all.

Kernel gurus write C and think assembler. Wrong crowd selected ;-)

You certainly do. How do you protect the system from a mistaken policy that
takes away all rights from the user supposed to manage it, and gives them
to the local script kiddie instead?

It efficiency doesn't matter, do it in userland. If efficiency matters, do
it in hand-tuned C + assembly, inside the kernel only if there is no other
way.

Doing it in userland helps even more.

The environment isn't the same, so this doesn't help that much. Besides, if
the job _can_ be done in userland, it has no business being done in the
kernel. Stuff is being moved _out_ of the kernel (for example, finding
partitions and filesystems) as we speak...

So the idea is _userland_ code stuffed into the _kernel_ to be checked and
executed there? And if it is broken, and denies all access, it is a nice
DoS.
