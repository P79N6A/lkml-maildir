Yes, this issue happens when using an emulator to "run" the 32-bit
application.
Yoav's patch leaves it to each architecture to decide how to
identify the emulated case.  ia64 has been using PER_LINUX32
for this.  If other 64-bit architectures ever need to do the
same thing, they can provide their own force_o_largefile()
macro.  Right now, I don't think that any of them need this
because they aren't using emulators for 32-bit.
