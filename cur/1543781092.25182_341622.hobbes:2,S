 Even with Steven's patch applied, root cannot read from /dev/kmem with the
following program, which works on 2.6.9.  "Invalid argument" means that the
"fd is attached to an object that is unsuitable for reading."
# ./desc2
GDT is at 0xc13097a0
read /dev/kmem: Invalid argument
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#define perr(err) { perror(err), exit(1); }
struct {
        unsigned short limit;
        unsigned int base;
} __attribute__ ((packed)) dtr;
int kmem, i;
int buf[1024];
int main() {
        if ((kmem = open("/dev/kmem", O_RDONLY)) < 0)
                perr("open /dev/kmem");
        asm("sgdtl %0" : "=m"(dtr));
        printf("GDT is at 0x%x\n", dtr.base);
        dtr.limit++;  /* convert to size */
        if (lseek(kmem, dtr.base, SEEK_SET) != dtr.base)
                perr("lseek /dev/kmem");
        if (read(kmem, buf, dtr.limit) != dtr.limit)
                perr("read /dev/kmem");
        for (i = 0; i < dtr.limit / 4; i += 2)
                if (buf[i+1])
                        printf("entry %d(0x%x): 0x%x 0x%x\n",
                                i / 2, i / 2, buf[i], buf[i+1]);
        return 0;
}
