Subject: Kernel (>2.3.4x) oops on unloading ray_cs

I've found a kernel oops with many of the later 2.3.x (where x >
40-something and including 2.3.51) kernels.  I hadn't noticed it much
since I normally use 2.3.35, but with the freeze, it should be fixed.
The ray_cs driver works fine with my Webgear Aviator 2.4 card, but on
unloading I get various OOPSes scrolling acrosss the screen.  Since it
kills the kernel, and I don't have a serial console, I haven't captured
them.  It looks like it always ends with something about "killing the
Idle task"...
I'm running the latest unstable Debian release on a Toshiba Portege
3015CT.  It's got a ToPIC cardbus controller in it.
What other info can I report to help debugging this?
Thanks,
Stephen
