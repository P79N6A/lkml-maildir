I get worried when I see the word "should" in a changelog.

So that takes us back to the pre-March 31 code, which was allegedly broken
on big-endian.

And that swaps the little-endian and bit-endian implementations of
FB_BIT_NR().  So if it was previously broken on big-endian and was working
on little-endian then it's presumably now broken on little-endian and
working on big-endian.  Or something.
