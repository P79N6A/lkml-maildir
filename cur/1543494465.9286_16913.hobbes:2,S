I saw this mail on another list and thought I'd pass it on here.
Since it's not the first time I've seen attacks on linux's
reliability I thought it's worth bringing it up. I dont know
whether an electronic version of this interview exists...
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Ken Thompson is interviewed in this month's _IEEE Computer_
magazine on UNIX and developments.  At one point during the
interview, Computer asks him what he thinks of Linux.  Here's his
response (any typos are mine, and I show italics via <em> and
</em>):
"Thompson: I view Linux as something that's not Microsoft -- a backlash
against Microsoft, no more and no less.  I don't think it will be very
successful in the long run.  I've looked at the source, and there are
pieces that are good and pieces that are not.  A whole bunch of random
people have contributed to this source, and the quality varies
drastically.
    My experience and some of my friends' experience is that Linux is
quite unreliable.  Microsoft is <em>really</em> unreliable but Linux is
<em>worse</em>.  In a non-PC environment, it just won't hold up.  If
you're using it on a single box, that's one thing.  But if you want to use
Linux in firewalls, gateways, embedded systems, and so on, it has a long
way to go."
