I think this still has the same problem.  pci_get_device grabs lock,
walks list, gets ref, and drops lock.  But the ref doesn't hold it on the
list, right?.  So some pci_remove_* could do list_del(&dev->global_list),
poison the prev/next pointers.  Subsequent pci_get_device would do ->next
and oops.  It seems the lock needs to be held for entire start/next/stop
sequence, or the ref needs to keep it on list.

Heh, the hch in me notes that pci_{put,get}_dev already check NULL device ;-)
