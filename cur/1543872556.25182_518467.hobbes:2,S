It's just a minor touch-up. If Mathieu is okay with it, I'd rather
leave him as the author and just send along an Acked-by: with it.
I'm not terribly attached to it, either. I just choked on my soda

etc. go by. (Which reminds me, I really need to figure out how to
consolidate the UP and SMP cases for all this.)
