Yep, and task cpu dancing.  Everytime a High prio task preempts a lower
prio RT task, that RT task might be pushed to another CPU.

Yep, but the more important thing than latency, is to make your
deadline.  Sometimes people forget that and just concentrate on latency.
But that's another story.

Argh, terminology is killing us all.  For this to be wrong, B isn't
"sleeping" it's "waiting" while in the run state.  "Sleeping" means that
it's not on the run queue and is just waiting for some event.  Which
would be OK for C to run then.  But if B is on the run queue and in the
the TASK_RUNNING state, it would be wrong for C to be running somewhere
where B could be running.

And here I don't know of another way besides an IPI to preempt C.  If C
is in userspace, how would you preempt C right a way if B suddenly wakes
up on the runqueue of A?

It's as clear as my face was in High School ;)
