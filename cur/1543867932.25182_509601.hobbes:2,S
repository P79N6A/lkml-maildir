You will need to have implemented two types of operations - userspace
daemon, which will request some notifications (i.e. notify me when event
type:1, event:2 is ready), and that one which will mark such requests as
ready.
For exactly your purpose I would use userspace kevent notifications - 
although in documentation I say that such notifications can be
marked from userspace, you can mark them as ready from kernel too
(obviously, since kevent is kernel mechanism).
You can also create own kevent notification type and storage (userspace
notification requests are stored in the main kevent queue (kevent_user))
and compile them only for s390 arch and thus do not overlap with
possible usage of userspace notifications.
As another tool to do the same I would suggest netlink (raw netlink
usage is not appreciated, but instead you can use connector or
gennetlink).
Kevent is much more lightweight especially when event is marked as ready
compared to netlink allocation. From the other point, kevent requires
some requests from userspace which can be marked as ready, while netlink
allows to generate them from 'void' (i.e. withoug userspace creating
request).
