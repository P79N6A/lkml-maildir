But... if you have it in .config, then you have to rebuild the kernel each
time. Maybe on an Alpha that doesn't matter, on anything I use a kernel
build takes minutes and an initrd create take seconds.

Okay, now I see what you are doing, I guess you just have enough system
power to invest the time and disk space in building a kernel for each
config. When there was a working mkinitrd I was happily able to use fewer
of my resources to generate boot setups for all my systems, at least of a
given arch.
