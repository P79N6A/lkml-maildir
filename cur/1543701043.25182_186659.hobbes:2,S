Yep, same trick I use... Hmm, perhaps it should be written
somewhere. But that's why "noresume" makes sense.

With enough thrust, you can make pig fly...

Ahha, okay. On swsusp (swsusp.sf.net) list, there was some patch for
something pretty much unrelated; it put regular sys_reboot() into
swsusp. Any chance to try that?
