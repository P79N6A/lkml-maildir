OK. I did that here (inverting the logic from the if blah then bug form).
It goes just as well. Do you want this made up as a patch for 2.4.9?
Leaving code that thereby becomes non-compiling to its owner's tender
care?
What assertions on the types do you want, btw? People have been
saying that unequal size types are ok, and that it's just signed vs
unsigned that's the problem, and even then only when it's the longer
type that's unsigned and the shorter that's signed. I'd be inclined
to be paranoid and leave the alarms ringing when sizes or signs don't
match exactly.
