Right, which effectively turns it into a single interrupt
for multiple queues as far as NAPI is concerned.

If you cannot make use of it sanely in your driver, it's hard to
justify this patch just in the cleanup sense since it breaks
NAPI interfaces and makes driver maintainence harder than it would
need to be.
Whereas if it makes a straightforward implementation in drivers
like ibm_emac possible, this tends to tip things over the edge
such that we can justify the maintainence hassles to some extent.
I think the intention with these changes, is that you would
have a napi struct per-queue.  It would be embedded in some
private per-queue software state struct, and from which you
could also get to the device.  So you'd do the "container_of()"
bit a little bit differently at the beginning of your ->poll()
method.
This way you don't need the dummy netdevices.
Anyways, please let us know what you come up with once you get
a chance to investigate this.
Thanks!
