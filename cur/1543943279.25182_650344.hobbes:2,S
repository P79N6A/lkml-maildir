When trying to put some stress on qemu by running the xfs testsuite
I get the following:
debian:~/xfs-cmds/xfstests# sh check 
[  438.166822] SGI XFS with ACLs, security attributes, realtime, large block numbers, no debug enabled
[  438.185557] SGI XFS Quota Management subsystem
[  438.193150] hdb: task_no_data_intr: status=0x41 { DriveReady Error }
[  438.194018] hdb: task_no_data_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
[  438.194195] ide: failed opcode was: 0x9d
and after that the kernel seems to hang.  Qemu is emulating a piix3
device, and using the piix driver.  This is on a pretty old kvm (version
28) because newer ones don't even compile.
