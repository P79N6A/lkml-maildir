No I didn't :).  I just checked the build not the working as such.  
From what I could infer from the 2.6.7 tree, there is no kref_init()
in core/message.c.  Well I dunno what made me think destroy_serial
was used to init (kref_init) that refcounter at that time so I have 
even exported destroy_serial in the patch so that it builds.  
(expored as in changing static to non static .. I build all drivers 
into the kernel usually and so the build didn't break for me).
I now realise destroy_serial is the wrong release function.  I am no expert 
in usb-drivers area, but I should be more careful than that. 
Thanks,
Kiran
