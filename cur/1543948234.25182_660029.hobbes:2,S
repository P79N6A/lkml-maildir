Okay -- I'll look at it some more.  I am however loathe to drop the
term open file description, because POSIX uses, as well as a number of
other Linux man pages by now.

Oh -- I wasn't suggesting we could make the change now -- it would
break the ABI and all that.  I was just wondering why the decision
wasn't made to do it the other way to begin with.  The existing
semantics are somewhat couterintuitive, and potentially interact
libraries that do private manipulations with file descriptors.
