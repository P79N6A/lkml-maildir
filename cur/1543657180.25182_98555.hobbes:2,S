This patch updates UML to 2.5.53.  As far as UML itself is concerned,
this is identical to all recent 2.5 UML releases, except that I tossed in
a small fix for a race involving multiple xterms popping up at once.
I'm in the process of merging my recent 2.4 changes into my 2.5 tree, but
I figured I'd get this patch out first.
The 2.5.53 UML patch is available at
