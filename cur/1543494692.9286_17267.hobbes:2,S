I don't think so. You just use pipe and non-pipe fd's as your only event
sources, and do a single select on the whole set. Then make the
appropriate callbacks for any events on each fd. I have a
multithreaded app that does just this, and the only locks it needs to
grab in connection with event handling is for genuinely process-wide
structures (like the UI request queue, and the error message queue).
At first, I was really annoyed that you couldn't select on a
semaphore, but I eventually saw that pipes gave me everything the
semaphores did (for this purpose, anyway - i'm using pthreads for
actual inter-thread synchronization).
