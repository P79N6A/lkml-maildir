I did this inquery back in 11 Dec 1998.... here was the best response.

Extracting from a web page. See especially point 3.

Unsupported boards
Linux now supports almost every current-production PCI Fast and
Gigabit Ethernet chip!  
The exceptions are generally unique boards based on supported chips: 
- Boards using the Digital Tulip chip must have a correct media table
  in the EEPROM. (Some common boards do have explicit driver support.)
- There is no plan to support the obsolete Intel EtherExpressPro 100A,
  which hasn't been produced in years.
- No board with an on-board processor is supported, because these
  invariably have a proprietary/undocumented interface. (EEPro Server
  and Matrox multiport PCI switch cards fall into this category.)
- The Essential Communications Gigabit Ethernet board is not yet
  supported.
- The Alteon Gigabit Ethernet chip is not supported because of lack of
  programming information from Alteon. Similarly the 3Com 3c985
- Gigabit Ethernet board is not yet supported.
- The new Intel Gigabit Ethernet board is not supported because of
  lack of programming information from Intel.
- The announced (but not yet available) Sun "GEM" Gigabit Ethernet
  chip is not yet supported.

Linux and the Intel EtherExpress Pro 100
This page contains information on using Linux with the Intel PCI
EtherExpress Pro100B board, Pro100+, and other PCI boards using the
i82557 or i82558 chip. 
"i960(R) Processor" quite obviously is not i82557 or i82558. Pay
attention.
