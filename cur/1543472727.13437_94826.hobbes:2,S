It catches it in the nmi handler, prints a message and carries on (look
in arch/i386/kernel)

Reboot yes, sync maybe - nmi doesnt honour normal interrupt locking so
you might NMI in the middle of a disk block being written and then who
knows quite what sync would do other than probably lock. Better
to make NMI just reboot. Better yet if the card was wired to the reset line
