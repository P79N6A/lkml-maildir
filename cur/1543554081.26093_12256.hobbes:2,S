Subject: [Patch] QoS as modules in 2.4.0-test10 not compiling.

Greetings,
I've been trying to compile the kernel with the QoS code as modules.
The net/Makefile didn't have 'sched' listed as a module subdirectory,
so it wasntt getting walked in a make_modules... any way, the
following patch fixes the problem.
