Yep. And in 2.4.0 we will see StarOffice breakage. Wonderful. Just what
will it buy us? It's not like it was hard to fix where it's broken. I.e.
on their side. Either they can do it now, or they will not do it in 6
months. Depends on the presence of somebody with a half-clue around the
whole thing.

I'ld rather avoid such precedents. Moreover, I think that in such case we
might check task->comm and recommend users to whack the crapware authors
with clue-by-four. Again, they _had_ similar problem. It's not the first
time. Period. If Sun can't find somebody who would have a shred of clue
about portability - too bad. For them. Submit a bug report to Sun. It's
their problem.

Two words: nasty precedent. Again, it's not like a couple of days differed
from the 5-6 months in this case. Heck, the simplest fix would be
#!/bin/bash
echo "StarOffice is crap"
echo -ne "%d[yodda,yodda]\0" | dd of=$THEIR_BINARY seek=$LOCATION conv=notrunc
