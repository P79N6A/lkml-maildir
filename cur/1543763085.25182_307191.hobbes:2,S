Are you implying that "He don't know JACK!"
Sorry, couldn't resist. Move along now, nothing to see here :-)  God
it's late, I need to go to bed.
Is that an American phrase. If so, it might not be understood elsewhere.
So just in case others don't understand this stupid joke. There's a
phrase "You don't know Jack" which is equivalent to saying "you don't
know what you're talking about".  Which makes this kind of a pun.
