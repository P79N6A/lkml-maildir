Subject: false positive in checkpatch.pl (complex macro values)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/24/42

in some code that does like:
#define foo { a, b, c, \
    d, e, f, g }
...
int boo[] = foo;
...
checkpatch.pl throws a fit:
ERROR: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parenthesis
#10: FILE: ...
+#define foo {a, b, c, d}
perhaps the check should also allow {...} ?  or ignore lists like this ...
