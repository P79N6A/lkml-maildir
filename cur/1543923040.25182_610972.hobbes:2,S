Hmmm ... what? I assume you know that:
1) A file descriptor is a userspace view/handle of a kernel object
2) The kernel object has a use-count for as many file descriptors that 
   have been handed out to userspace
3) A close() decreases the internal counter by one
4) The kernel object gets effectively closed when the internal counter 
   goes to zero
5) A fork() acts as a dup() on the file descriptors by hence bumping up 
   its internal counter
6) Epoll removes the file from the set, when the *kernel* object gets 
   closed (internal use-count goes to zero)
With that in mind, how can the code snippet above trigger a removal from 
the epoll set?
