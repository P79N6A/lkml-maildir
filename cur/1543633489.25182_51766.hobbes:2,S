   /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/../{arp_filter,tag}
   are not documented.
   
Nobody had time to document them, that is all.
   /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_rate_limit is jiffies.
   Shouldn't this be HZ, i.e. jiffies shouldn't
   be exported to userspace as it's non portable?
What if you want to specify value smaller than HZ?
That is the most typical for this setting.
