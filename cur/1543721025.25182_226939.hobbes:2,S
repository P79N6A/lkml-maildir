Actually that's not the case.  The UID is currently insufficient to
describe the security domain that a process is running in.  The whole
of the LSM infrastructure is designed with this in mind.  So somehting
like SELinux may enforce a security domain change (w/out a UID change)
across an execve() of pagsh.  I was simply trying to ascertain if you
were storing this within task->user which I think would be wrong.
