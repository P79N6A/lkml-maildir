This isn't much of a surprise, nor is is likely a problem in your
lockmeter port.  The offender is ext3_delete_inode.  The BKL was only
taken here twice out of the 126172 lock_kernel() which were profiled.
The 51ms happened once and the other time, the lock was released much
more quickly.
  SPINLOCKS     HOLD        WAIT
  UTIL  CON  MEAN( MAX ) MEAN( MAX)(% CPU) TOTAL NOWAIT SPIN RJECT
 0.02%    0% 26ms( 51ms)  0us                  2   100%    0%    0%
The odds are that the 22ms wait in ext3_writepage and the 20ms wait in
schedule were due to this single hold.  Actually, the schedule one could
very well be caused by the reacquisiton after ext3_delete_inode() hit
something that made it sleep with the BKL held.
I've thought that it would be helpful to have lockmeter special-case the
reacquire_kernel() in schedule, to properly attribute the time to the
original offender.
