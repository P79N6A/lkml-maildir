Harald, I'm going to modify this to just use u_int64_t as that
should be totally sufficient.
It is the largest type, and will produce the desired results without
the silly structure.
Some malloc() implementations use "long double" to figure out the
largest type size and alignment requirements any C type might have
on the machine.  But there is no reason to use that here.
