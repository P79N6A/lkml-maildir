Hello all,
currently it seems that select keeps blocking when the USB device behind
ttyUSBx gets unplugged. My understanding is, that select should return
when the next call to one of the operations (read/write) will not block.
This is certainly true for failing with ENODEV. So, is this an issue
that will be fixed or should I poll (not the syscall) the device? Or is 
there another way to monitor for a vanishing tty (it should not be USB 
specific).
Thanks in advance
  Joerg
