My machines and the fedora rawhide machines using the 2.6.20-rcX
releases look nothing like what you pasted.  If they did, hald would
be working...  (I'll note that bugs have also been logged against
Pulse and HAL by users having trouble, so it's not just us.)
What you said you have:

In other words... no resemblance whatsoever, so something is obviously
very wrong.  That is a vanilla 2.6.20-rc5 build on a fedora rawhide
machine, the rawhide-tweaked kernel and 2.6.19-rc6-mm2 produces the
same results.
With my patch, at least the 'old' entries for the pcm devices are as
before (The patch doesn't 'correct' anything for the device types
other than pcm and control, adsp and audio are still messed):
