Search me, with 2.3.10-pre4 applied, the exploit works again (as expected,
really); therefore you won't be able to run secure multi-user systems with
2.3.10+.
Interestingly, 2.3.6 changed from the official work-around (setting
the NO_LOCK bit, whatever that does) to something else, which I haven't managed
to figure out as I don't have the Cyrix 6x86 data books kicking around.
Did this patch get fed into 2.2.x as well? I guess you can see where my
thoughts are leading..
Meantime set6x86 can used on start-up to implement either of the two work
arounds.
