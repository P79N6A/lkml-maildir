I'm getting the following errors trying to compile 2.2.13:
-----
In file included from init/version.c:12:
/usr/local/src/linux/linux-2.2.13/include/linux/compile.h:1: parse 
error before `-'
init/version.c:20: `UTS_VERSION' undeclared here (not in a function)
init/version.c:20: initializer element is not constant
init/version.c:20: (near initialization for `System_utsname.version')
init/version.c:26: parse error before `UTS_VERSION'
-----
2.2.13pre18 didn't seem to have any trouble... anyone else seeing this?
