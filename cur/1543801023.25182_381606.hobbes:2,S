Easy to revert 2.6.14.5 to 2.6.14 then patch to 2.6.15 if you follow 
the stable series.  Still saves ~30MB downloading source.
Because I'm also compiling the -rc? and -mm? I keep 2.6.14 tree and use 
hardlink trees, when 2.6.15 came out I patched the 2.6.14 to 2.6.15 
and deleted the development trees -- works for me ;)
And no, I'll not automate this, it's enough dealing with finger trouble 
let alone scripts doing things behind my back!  I have vim trained to 
break hardlink files on write, I don't get myself in trouble so much.
Grant.
