No, it is smarter than that. The exact algorithms are not obvious - even the
linux VM gurus don't quite agree on them :) If you really want to know how
it works, browse at 
http://www.linux-mm.org
 - there you can find many
documents on it and plenty of good links.

Through the tunables in /proc/sys/vm/.
You can find some explanation for these in beginning of
/usr/src/linux/vm/vmscan.c etc (as of 2.4.19rc3) I don't know if there's
better documentation somewhere.
If you use -ac, recent 2.5 or vendor a kernel, you may find yourself with
Rik van Riel's vm implementation. It may have better documentation - in
different place.

Yes, that's exactly where disk cache will help you.

Well, there can be more than one process allocating memory. You shell is
then competing with all of them to get memory. Swap is no magic bullet in
this case either - it just adds more leeway for you.

I stand corrected - I wrote that without thinking.
