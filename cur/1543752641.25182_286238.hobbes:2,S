Security researchers are an odd bunch. They're very attached to their
bugs in the sense they want to be the ones who get the glory for
having reported it.
As soon as bugs start getting forwarded around between lists, the
potential for leaks increases greatly. The recent fiasco surrounding
one of the isec.pl holes was believed to have been caused due to
someone 'sniffing upstream' for example.
When issues get leaked, the incentive for a researcher to use the
same process again goes away, which hurts us.  Basically, trying
to keep them happy is in our best interests.
