    Neither am I - but, according to comments from RedHat a while back,
    they repackage mount separately because they provide a NEWER version
    of mount than is in the util-linux package. This will ALSO result in
    `mount --version` giving the wrong answer...
There is no newer version.
In ancient times I came with frequent releases of mount, at a time
when util-linux was released very infrequently. These years mount
is part of util-linux, and util-linux is released frequently.
    Unless one can guarantee that the util-linux and mount packages are
    the SAME version, mount can't be guaranteed to report the version of
    the util-linux package installed. RedHat provide a NEWER version of
    mount to util-linux so that guarantee doesnae exist.
I do not think they do.

    {Shrug} Please explain why I was unable to get ver_linux to report a
When other people can and you cannot, why should I explain your failure?
Let me just check. A version from 1993:
  % ./loadkeys -h 2>&1 | head -1
  loadkeys version 0.81
A version from 2001:
  % ./loadkeys -h 2>&1 | head -1
  loadkeys version 1.06
Maybe nothing has changed here the past eight years. It just works.
Perhaps you tried some modified version.
