The reason is that this key is not the ordinary backslash-bar key, it's
the so-called 103rd key on some european keyboards. It generates a
different scancode.
2.4 used the same keycode for both the scancodes, 2.6 does not, so that
it's possible to differentiate between the keys on keyboards that have
both this one and also the standard backslash-bar.
