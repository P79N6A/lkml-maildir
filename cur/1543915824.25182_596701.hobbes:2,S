chroot with having open directories outside the chroot is a convenience
feature, allowing e.g. to install programs into a different root while
opening the archives from another root tree. Only if there is a working
capability system preventing root from accessing the hardware*, a chroot
may become a security feature.
Off cause having the new fchdir, you might run "chroot /var/foo 3< /" in
order to pass a dir filehandle and compromise your own security, but this
is nothin a system should protect against.
The only problem I'm concerned about is passing a file descriptor to a
privileged, compromised process using an abstract unix socket. This combines
two different privileges, possibly increasing the impact of the attack.
I think it may be enough to not allow passing directory fds if the two
processes have different device/inode/namespace, but I'm not sure about
device fds.
*) chmod u+s binary; su nobody; exec binary; mount tmpfs /; mknod dev_mem
   should be enough to void most root-in-chroot setups. Very untested.
