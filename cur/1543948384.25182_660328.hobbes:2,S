My suggestion is merely to make the number of concurrent page reclaim 
threads be a function of how many online cpus there are.  Threads can 
easily be added or removed for cpu hotplug events by callback functions.
That's different than allowing users to change the number of threads with 
yet another sysctl.  Unless there are situations that can be presented 
where tuning the number of threads is advantageous to reduce lock 
contention, for example, and not simply working around other VM problems, 
then I see no point for an additional sysctl.
So my suggestion is to implement this in terms of 
CONFIG_NUM_RECLAIM_THREADS_PER_CPU and add callback functions for cpu 
hotplug events that add or remove this number of threads.
