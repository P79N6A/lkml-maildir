Oh, just the NFSv3 client makes lots of sense. It's made our day here.
Gone are problems with communication vs Solaris & AIX servers. Gone are
the speed-problems. All in all, just the client made us party. Because
our web-server get's its data via NFS.
Of course, we'd be happy to get the NFSv3 server patches in too, but
I think Alan is right here; be careful and take one step at a time.

I'd opt for early in v2.2.19pre instead. + the NLM4 support. I'm quite
annoyed by now getting all those "Service not supported" messages.
