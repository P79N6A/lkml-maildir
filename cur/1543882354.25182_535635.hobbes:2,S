Yea. Its a little odd in this case, because Peter sent me the signed off
code, then I've made tweaks to it and signed it off, then peter picked
that up and has made further improvements.
So I don't think it is inaccurate, but I see how it could be confusing.
Maybe Peter should add an extra signed-off so its more clear?
