Total agreement.  But note that this specifically doesn't mean that
there is a `main file' plus `associated data'.  I'd propose the following
example of forks:
	.bundle/bin
	.bundle/man
	.bundle/lib
	.bundle/etc
Wait, let's call it `package' instead of `.bundle'.
I have this really funny feeling that I've already seen it somewhere.
	Stefan
