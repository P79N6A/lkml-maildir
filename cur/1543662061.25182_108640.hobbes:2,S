However, looking at the definition of clone_list[], it's pretty obvious
that this was intended:
    for (i=0; clone_list[i].vendor_id != 0; i++) {...
It's searching through a zero-terminated table of vendor_id's.
It's possible it started off life as
     i < sizeof(clone_list) && clone_list[i].vendor_id != 0
or some such.
