I think the number of other "correct" OSes that actually step the time 
on leap seconds is not that large (at least doing the announcement via 
NTP). According to 
http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-algo-real.htm#AEN2499
 
leap seconds are only changed via stepping if you have the right kernel 
discipline (notes on how to check whether a given OS has the kernel 
kernel discipline are mentioned on 
http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-algo-kernel.htm#AEN2220
 ).
I have a feeling that OSX doesn't do it (there's a mailing list post 
from 2005 where someone was trying to add FreeBSD's ntp_adjtime to 
Darwin 
http://lists.apple.com/archives/Darwin-kernel/2005/Jan/msg00004.html
 ). 
Additionally folks I know using ntpd synchronized OSX machines said 
their machines were off by one second right after the new year.
Windows is also known not to do it without slewing:
