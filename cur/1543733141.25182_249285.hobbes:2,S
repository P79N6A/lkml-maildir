Hey, i wonder which scheduler you people have the best experiences with,
staircase or nicksched?
personally i were using nicksched for a long time, but then i tried
staircase, and i like it overall more,
with nicksched its like, 1 process gets good prioity, so that if tvtime
is running, it runs perfect, but moving windows and stuff will be not so
fluid.
with staircase, the overall performance is not as fast, but
interactivity is really good, like tvtime runs fine, moving windows are
fast as lightening, setiathome can also run perfect.
