Specifically, (at the API) upon an error -1 (nothing else) is to be
returned and 'errno' set appropriately. The results of a successful ioctl()
operation is supposed to have been returned in the parameter list (via
pointer). So, you have found a design bug. I wonder how much stuff
gets broken if this gets fixed?
I suggest you just fix it and see what breaks. Maybe sombody's
CD writer will break, but a patch will quickly be made by the
maintainer(s).
Cheers,
