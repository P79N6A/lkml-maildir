Description:
- there are already __cpuinit* annotations in the kernel
- on UP kernels supporting suspend/resume, such annotated code
  currently gets freed after booting (and this works)
- with your patch applied, this code no longer gets freed
Whether or not this is a problem depends on whether you care about the 
memory used by the kernel or not...
My other issues with your patch were:
- whatever warning this patch was supposed to fixed was not shown
  (the patch description didn't mention any warning at all) - and
  understanding a fix gets easier when you know the problem it's
  supposed to fix
- this patch shouldn't be x86 specific since the issue how to 
  annotate suspend and CPU hotplug code isn't x86 specific
