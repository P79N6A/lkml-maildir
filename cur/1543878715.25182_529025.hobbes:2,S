From another piece of this thread.

So it looks like there were about 1500 kernel threads that started up before
kthread started.
So the kernel threads appear to have init as their parent is because
they started before kthread for the most part.
At 10 kernel threads per cpu there may be a little bloat but it isn't
out of control.  It is mostly that we are observing the kernel as
NR_CPUS approaches infinity.  4096 isn't infinity yet but it's easily
a 1000 fold bigger then most people are used to :)
