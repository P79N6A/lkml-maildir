This should have gone to the linux-arm-kernel mailing list as well,
so that all the people interested in ARM can see it as soon as
possible. See linux-arm-kernel@lists.arm.linux.org.uk
The only suggestion I could think of would to be change to having
an check_tag_mem32() function, or put each check on its own line
to make it easier to read what each check is doing.
ie:
	if (meminfo.nr_banks >= NR_BANKS ||
	    tag->u.mem.size & ~PAGE_MASK || /* size is unaligned */
	    tag->u.mem.size == 0 ||	    /* no memory here */
	    tag->u.mem.start & ~PAGE_MASK)  /* start is unaligned */ 
	{
(even without the comments it makes it easier to see what each test
is.
