Hello, I just installed RedHat-5.2, fully updated it, and hand/configured 
compiled linux kernel 2.0.36 (final of course)..., the same errors with
2.0.36-pre7 (module), 2.0.36 final precompiled (module) and included in
the RedHat-5.2 updates...
The network card is a NE2000 PCI and works great when using Windoze98 in
linux it does not work at all and it keeps crying "eth0: timeout waiting
for Tx RDC." about 1 time in 2 seconds.... The driver is compiled into the
kernel...
The same netcard works perfect with 2.0.34 on the same machine ...!!??@!?!?@
The sistem is a iPII-450, one CPU, all IDE, 6,4 GB Quantum Fireball EX,
Sony-CDU721 ATAPI cdrom, 128MB RAM, Matrox Millenium G200...

ne2l-pci.c: PCI NE2000 clone 'Via 82C926' at I/O 0xe400, IRQ 9.
eth0: PCI NE2000 found at 0xe400, IRQ 9, 08:00:31:00:38:C9
Sorry I don't know P. Gortmaker's e-mail address...
IS This is a BUG? I think so...
