the two are obviously related (just that the 'restrict' keyword can be 
used for same-type pointers so it gives even broader leeway) so i used the 
0.17% figure i already had to give a ballpark figure about what such type 
of optimizations can bring us in general.
(Different-type pointer uses are a common pattern: we have a lot of places 
where we have pointers to structures with different types so 
strict-aliasing optimization opportunities apply quite broadly already.)
