Yeah, well, started out that way, as G. Bevin who wrote it at the
time, came from ROCK Linux (user I think).  I do not think it resembles
it much, if at all anymore though, and I know some additions have
been added that you guys might think about, like also hooking execve
(meaning subsequent bash's will still have LD_PRELOAD=sandboxlib
 in env, and if make/whatever sets LD_PRELOAD, the wrapper will add
 the sandboxlib back, etc), and one or two others I think.
