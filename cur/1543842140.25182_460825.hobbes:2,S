You are effectively approaching seeky writes, I bet it's just the drive
firmware biting you. Repeat the test on a different drive, and see if
you see an identical pattern.

I don't think the io path has anything to do with this. Why are you
expecting non-sequential writes to continue to be fast? They wont be.
