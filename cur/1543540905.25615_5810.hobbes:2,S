What if the data changes before your background thread have finished
updating the ACLs?
1. change ACLs for /dir recursively
2. chage ACL for /dir/file
3. thread executing (1) changes ACL of /dir/file
Is the time spent in the change-acl systemcall an issue at all? If the
user wants this to be a background task, ha can just fork, right?
(Yes, I know it will not be atomic - is that an issue?)
