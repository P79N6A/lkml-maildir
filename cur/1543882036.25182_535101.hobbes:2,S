I have a hard time believe that device hardware limits don't allow them
to have enough space to handle larger requests.  If so it was a poor
design by the hardware manufacturers.

Splitting the blocks doesn't change the transfer effort one iota.
The bus pci/pcie/hypertransport already have block sizes below 4KB.
Reading a longer list of descriptors might slow things down, but I would
be surprised.
The physical medium is the primary disk bottleneck.
Thinking about it the fastest thing I can do with a filesystem or disk
is to not use it.  That is to cache it efficiently. Having page sized
chunks in my cache increases my caching efficiency.   Large order
pages work directly against my caching efficiency.

Perhaps this is just a matter of cleaning them up so they are no
longer hacks?
You are trying to couple something that has no business being coupled
as it reduces the system usability when you couple them.

This is fundamental.  Fragmentation when you multiple chunk sizes
cannot be solved without a the ability to move things in memory,
whereas it doesn't exist when you only have a single chunk size.

The reason they are different is that they have very different
fundamental properties.  Flash devices have essentially no seek time
so random access if fast.  However the have a maximum number of erases
per sector so you have to be careful to do wear leveling.  Flash
devices are distinctly different, and using the block layer for them
while they do not behave like block devices is the wrong thing to do.

I agree that less meta data helps.  But switching to extents can reduce the
meta data much more, and still doesn't penalize you for small files if
you have them.

Lots of small requests are fundamental.  If lots of small requests were
not fundamental we would gets large requests scatter gather requests.

Freak no.  You teach the code how to have a block in multiple physical
pages.

No. I propose to avoid all designs that have the concept of
fragmentation.
There is an argument for having struct page control more than 4K
of memory even when the hardware page size is 4K.  But that is a
separate problem.  And by only having one size we still don't
get fragmentation.
