This is slightly off topic, as it isn't a kernel implementation.  But in
regards to encryption options above the filesystem, there are user-space
tools for doing this.
For example (ahem, shamelessly plugging my own work)
pobox.com/~vgough/encfs.html - an encrypted filesystem in user-space
which uses the Linux kernel module FUSE (sf.net/projects/avf) to export
a filesystem interface to userland.  As a side note, FUSE also has
python, perl, and Java bindings for your programming pleasure.  
EncFS acts as a pass-thru layer to an existing filesystem, so it does
not require allocating space ahead of time.  But it does not do what the
original email asked, of encrypting on a file by file basis.  It is more
like a reimplementation of CFS, but without NFS being involved.  What
was asked for sounds more like TCFS (for 2.0.x and 2.2.x kernels).
