The local statd process is supposed to decode the notification from the
remote client/server, and then notify the kernel. It already sends that
notification on a per-nlm_host basis (i.e. it the call down to the
kernel contains the <address,version,transport protocol>.
If we need to mark more than one <address,version,transport protocol>
tuple as rebooting when we get a notification from the remote
client/server, then why not fix statd so that it does so. Why perform
these extra mappings in the kernel, which doesn't have the benefit of
reverse DNS lookups etc to help it out?
