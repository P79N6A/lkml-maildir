I think you missed one of the main points - you don't get any extra 
space until you mark some of your files as elastic.
You're right - under this system, nobody would get any space from 
deletion of your files because you would use the system as a normal hard 
quota system - you would mark no files as elastic, and would therefore 
be limited to your quota (in the example you gave, you would not be 
using 110M, because your quota would have limited you to 100M).  If you 
were so kind as to mark something as elastic (say, that recently 
doneloaded install tarball of the Gimp), then you would remove the 
storage taken by those files from your quota usage and would have more 
space available, with the risk that the elastic files might not stick 
around.
Under no circumstance would you lose any file that fits under your quota.

Controlled by you using one of the methods that have been suggested:
a .elastic file/directory structure
/scratch/ space usage
a filesystem that can keep track of these things, and a program like chmod
xattrs and other userspace tools
etc.
