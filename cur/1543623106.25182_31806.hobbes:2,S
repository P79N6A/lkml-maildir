	The rp_filter value of 2 is not support from Linux and
after reading the "5.3.8 Source Address Validation" paragraph
from rfc1812 it seems rp_filter 1 covers it. What exactly do
you mean by value of 2? Note that the remote box does not want to
spoof, it was directed from BOX1 to a wrong MAC where the traffic is 
spoofed, the remote hosts are not guilty. They connect to the MAC we 
provide by broadcasts.
	To Erich, rfc1812, 5.3.8 Source Address Validation:
If this feature is implemented, it MUST be disabled by default
