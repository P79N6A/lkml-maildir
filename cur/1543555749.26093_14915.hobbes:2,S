Wrong.  The initial value is well-defined.  Go and read any C standard you
choose.  Any C standard you care.  You will find out something really
interesting.  I can guarantee that you will find out that it will be
initialised to zero.  Unconditionally.  No question.  Absolutely.

Why?  Again, it is WELL defined, and is WELL defined in any C standard.

Your point here is as clear as mud.

There is absolutely NO destabilisation going on here.  Get a grip, read the
C standards, read the C startup code.  Then come back with something more
relevent.
