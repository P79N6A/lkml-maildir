I'm having the exact same problem, on 2.3.48.  It complains that I might
not own the console.  /dev/tty0 exists, and is a link to /dev/vc/0.  The
permissions on it are a little weird:
lr-xr-xr-x   1 root     root            0 Feb 29 15:50 /dev/tty0 -> vc/0
I've tried changing them with a PERMISSIONS string in devfsd.conf and
directly, but of course chmod does not work on links--only on the file
that the link points to.  And evidently, X thinks that it cannot write
to tty0, because tty0 (and *all* the symlinks, every last one of them
under /dev) do not have the write bit set.  Admittedly, this is not a
problem on such devices as /dev/cdrom, or other read-only media, but
when you have apps with the old names hard-coded (like X), and want to
make symlinks to satisfy those hard-codings, but the symlinks won't let
you make them lrwxrwxrwx, you can get rather frustrated.
root@reliant:/dev$ ls -l tty0
lr-xr-xr-x   1 root     root            0 Feb 29 15:50 tty0 -> vc/0
root@reliant:/dev$ rm -f tty0
root@reliant:/dev$ ls -l tty0
ls: tty0: No such file or directory
root@reliant:/dev$ ln -sf vc/0 tty0
root@reliant:/dev$ ls -l tty0
lr-xr-xr-x   1 root     root            0 Feb 29 23:07 tty0 -> vc/0
This would seem to be a fairly major failing in either devfs or devfsd. 
Is it a known bug, or really a bug?  How do we fix it?  It doesn't seem
to be documented anywhere.  I've tried playing with the umask, and
deleting/recreating symlinks, but nothing seems to work.  Is there some
undocumented configuration option that I should know about?
TIA for answers.  devfs has gone through some extreme changes since
2.2.x.  Once upon a time, it was fairly effortless and bug-free, and
compiling the patch into the kernel was really all that was required.
Now, it seems needlessly complicated.  For systems developers, I guess
that's not an issue--as they like to spend extraordinary amounts of time
in making a system work, as opposed to the rest of us who just want to
use the system.
