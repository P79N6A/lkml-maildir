That's the bprm_secureexec logic change that has already been mentioned;
that determines the AT_SECURE value, and glibc then just acts based on
that value provided by the kernel.  Just a matter of extending
cap_bprm_secureexec to compare the capability sets.  Already on Serge's
todo list, but it is necessary for this to be a safe change, and should
happen before this patch goes anywhere (even -mm), IMHO.
