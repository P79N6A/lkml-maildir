I'm not sure, I was hoping you or Ingo could comment on this. But some
kind of locking seems to required at least on 32-bit platforms, since
sum_exec_runtime is a 64-bit number.

Good point - cgroups certainly prevents a cgroup itself from being
freed while a control file is being read in an RCU section, and
prevents a task group from being destroyed when that task group has
been read via a task's cgroups pointer and the reader is still in an
RCU section, but we need a generic protection for subsystem state
objects being accessed via control files too.
Using cgroup_mutex is certainly possible for now, although more
heavy-weight than I'd like long term. Using css_get isn't the right
approach, I think - we shouldn't be able to cause an rmdir to fail due
to a concurrent read.
