...I compiled 2.4.15 + Tim Hockin's HPT370 patch. I let it run the test over
night, but
   dd if=/dev/md0 bs=1048576 skip=65536 count=1024 | md5sum
had stalled at _second_ run. The first, identical run had gone through.
The point where it happened is after dd has read the last (not whole GB) and
is trying to skip slightly more than the size of md0:

This never happened with 2.2.*
What's more, the md5sum of 1st and 2nd run differ at 31GB:

There's two BadCRC errors in the log:
hdg: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdg: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
hdg: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdg: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
Bleah. I'll try 2.4.15 vanilla (no hpt patch) and UDMA33 (instead of UDMA66)
next.
