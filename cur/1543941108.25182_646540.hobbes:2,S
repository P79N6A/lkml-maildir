I think this would be a good long term thing, but would require restructuring 
of all the kallsyms scripts, as well as everything in the kernel...

I can put something together if Rusty agrees this is the way to go.

Hmmm - I would need to defer to Ingo to understand the dependencies in lockdep 
and init labels/addresses in kallsyms_addresses.

Maybe the lockdep needs to keep track of the label, not the address.

That seems a little cumbersome to me...
