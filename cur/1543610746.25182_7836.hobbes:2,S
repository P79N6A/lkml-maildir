Examining the code :
                         if (i810_dev == NULL) {
                                 printk(KERN_ERR PFX "agpgart: Detected an "
                                        "Intel i815, but could not find the"
                                        " secondary device. Assuming a "
                                        "non-integrated video card.\n");
                                 break;
This leads me to believe the "secondary device"  could be the integrated
graphics component on the i810/815.
As the i830M doesn't have one (the i830MG does), I suppose this could
lead to the aforementioned error message, and hence failure of the
agpgart modprobe ?
Could it be that one has to differentiate between i830MG (secondary
device, and hence analoguous to i810/i815) and i830M (no secondary
device, and possibly analoguous to i830/i840/i845/... : no check for 2nd
device needed ) ?
Offcourse, I could be utterly wrong.
Regards,
Didier
