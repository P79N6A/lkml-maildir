Huh? Isn't there a backup superblock always at block 131072? (Unless the
disk is smaller than 128M).
On the other hand, if the superblock is hosed, it's quite unlikely
that the "root dir" and other stuff near the beginning of the disk are
in good enough shape to recover the filesystem without "expert"
(human) help.
Oh, and let me say in public again: 
	1k blocks ->  8k blocks/group ->   8M groups
	2k blocks -> 16k blocks/group ->  32M groups
	4k blocks -> 32k blocks/group -> 128M groups
(That's why it REALLY helps in the "delete speed" and "fsck speed" to
have larger blocks.)
