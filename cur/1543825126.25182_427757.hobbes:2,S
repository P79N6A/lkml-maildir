You are also ignoring the fact that not all distros store configs
there (and/or under that name).

My personal favorite is /proc/config.gz . It has the very nice
property that even if I misplace my config file (or rebuild my tree
several times with different configs and don't save the one for my
running kernel) then I can always get the config for any of the
kernels I have installed, simply by booting it (or extracting it from
the kernel image).
