Whilst calling it the e1000 problem (that was how it was originally 
reported) I should say that this was related to the sysfs change in the 
following patches:
     gregkh-driver-network-class_device-to-device.patch
     gregkh-driver-class_device_rename-remove.patch
I have two boxes under test which were failing on -mm1 similar to teh 
following (from userland):
     eth-id-00:02:55:d3:37:4a            No interface found
Both are booting -mm2 fine.
I can only see two outstanding issues.  An IDE lost interrupt issue on a 
blade we have under test which I believe benh is looking at, and what 
looks like an s390 tool chain issue which I am told is being looked at.
