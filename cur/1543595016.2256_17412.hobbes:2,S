Not to mention utterly unenforceable. Consider:
1) Oracle Corp. builds their database for Linux on a Linux system.
2) Said system comes with standard header files, which happen in this case to
   be GPL'd header files.
3) Oracle Corp.'s database becomes GPL.
There's not a court in the civilised world that would uphold the GPL in that
scenario.
