Con,
I have been using SCHED_BATCH on two machines now with expected
results. So this you might consider this as another success report :-)
Do you think that these schedulers could come into the mainline
soon? Would you submit them to Linus without the staircase scheduler
or would you rather wait for the whole bunch of changes to get
rock-stable ?
Best regards,
Maciej
