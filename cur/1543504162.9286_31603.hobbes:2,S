Read the text again:
 kernel messages will appear on both the VGA console and the 2nd serial port
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
"echo bar > /dev/console" is not a kernel message. You're just
opening /dev/console in usermode. The docs say:
The last device will be used when you open /dev/console
    ^^^^^^^^^^^                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the kernel messages do not appear either - did you turn on the
serial console option when compiling the kernel ?
