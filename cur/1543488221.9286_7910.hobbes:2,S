Hi,
yesterday, my 2.2.1 kernel crashed again without any further information.
No oops, no useful syslog entries, no high load....
What I was doing before the crash:
#fdisk -l > /tmp/fdisk
#lpr /tmp/fdisk
#mwrite /tmp/fdisk a:
The printing was finished, but during the writing process on the disk,
Linux hang an uninterruptibly, the keyboard and everything else was
left dead. 
It's pretty interesting, that I was using my system before for several
hours, doing harddisk recording, burining CDs (so, a lot of disk
activity), reading files from a floppy and even compiling. There were
absolutely no anomalies. So, the only conclusion, I can draw, is, that
the printing process was harmful. (You remember my posting from monday,
when lpd completely killed my system).
The last two entries in /var/adm/syslog were:
modprobe: can't locate block-major-22
kernel: lp0 using parport0 (polling)
The first line (block-major-22 is ide-probe) seems to come from the
"fdisk -l" statement, which showed my the partition table entries from
my SCSI and from my IDE disk. It successfully queried my IDE disk, despite
of the error message.
The second line came, when I printed the partition tables.
Does anyone have a clue, what is wrong here? Maybe, it's really time
to switch to 2.2.2 ??
Ciao and thank you all in advance
  Christoph
