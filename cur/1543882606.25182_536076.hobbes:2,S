Hello,
I am did compile those kernels to the best available hardware in a
P-III machine. (Research experiment - P-III box is a part of Wireless
stuff).
I have this enigma called Hardware Monitoring support on many boards. Because:
a) Vendors don't give enough info - which chips are meant for Hardware
Monitoring in a particular board, say in this case a P-III 810E or P4
945 or Core2Duo 965/975 boards.
b) Unfortunately, there isn't any reference available in the Config to
select the chips for the respective boards. Example - for 810E - some
x chip is to be enabled in that tree.
How to solve this problem? How to know in Linux (any commands) whether
H/W Mon is supported by 810E board or 945 board? (apart from digging
from the manuals to narrow down the problem).
I am willing to do something for this task (volunteer). Comments?
