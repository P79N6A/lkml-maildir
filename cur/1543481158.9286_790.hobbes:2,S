Maybe, one function at a time --one carefully checked function at a time.
For instance, the way we were 'taught` to write code (by instuctors and
professors who never built actual products, BTW) goes something like
this...
funct()
{
    if(funct1()) {
        if(funct2()) {
            if(funct3()) {
                if(funct4())
                   do_something();
                else
                    compain_about_funct4();
            }
            else
               complain_about_funct3();
        }
        else
            complain_about_funct2();
     }
     else
        complain_about_funct1();
   }
}
...... produces absolutely rotten code on every compiler I've ever
used. This is because it jumps on the normal-flow condition.
That's why it is often written as:
funct()
{
     if(!funct1())
        goto quit;
     if(!funct2())
        goto quit;
     if(!funct3())
        goto quit;
     if(!funct4())
        goto quit;
     do_something();
     return GOOD;
  quit:;
     complain();
     return BAD;
}
This jumps only on the error conditions.
Sometimes gotos can be removed as:
   if(!funct1())
       return BAD;
Even the usual loop-counters often produce bad, bad, bad code.
    for(i=0; i< MAX; i++)
        do_something();
You would think that, since this construct is so often used, the 'C'
compilers would at least optimize this. Nope, guess again. Even telling
the compiler to use 'register int i`, even if it does, the loop test
and the increment end up being in the wrong order, forcing extra code
to determine the terminating condition.
You see, if `i` is used only as a count, not as an index, and if the
value of `i` is not used after the loop terminates, the compiler could
decrement a starting value to zero instead of starting at zero and
incrementing to some limit. In this case there would be no need to
compare against a final value because on most/many/(all?) processors
the flags change automatically when decrementing to zero or decrementing
to a negative number.
To get around the bad code generation, programmers who understand
these things often code....
	while(i--)
            ;
However, gcc will usually mess with this and end up decrementing a
value on the stack or in the register-variable case, add extra code.
Like:
void foo()
{
   puts("Do not optimize this away!");
}
main()
{
    register int i;
    i = 10;
    while(i--)
        foo();
}
	.file	"xxx.c"
	.version	"01.01"
gcc2_compiled.:
.section	.rodata
.LC0:
	.string	"Do not optimize this away!"
.text
	.align 4
.globl foo
	.type	 foo,@function
foo:
	pushl %ebp
	movl %esp,%ebp
	pushl $.LC0
	call puts
	addl $4,%esp
.L1:
	movl %ebp,%esp
	popl %ebp
	ret
.Lfe1:
	.size	 foo,.Lfe1-foo
	.align 4
.globl main
	.type	 main,@function
main:
	pushl %ebp
	movl %esp,%ebp
	pushl %ebx
	movl $10,%ebx
.L3:
	decl %ebx	# This changes the sign flag.
	cmpl $-1,%ebx	# This is NOT necessary
	jne .L5		# Should be js .L4 (terminating condition)
	jmp .L4		# Should fall through to `call foo`
	.align 4	# Should not exist
.L5:
	call foo
	jmp .L3
	.align 4
.L4:
.L2:
	movl -4(%ebp),%ebx
	movl %ebp,%esp
	popl %ebp
	ret
.Lfe2:
	.size	 main,.Lfe2-main
	.ident	"GCC: (GNU) 2.8.1"
    
So, to have a fast Operating System, one must often compromise asthetics
and get down and dirty, mucking with the registers.
