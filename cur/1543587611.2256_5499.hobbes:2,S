The latest version is always available at 
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/cml2/
Release 1.1.1: Sat Apr 14 23:41:34 EDT 2001
	* Synchronized with 2.4.4-pre1.
	* Adam Lackorzynski's patch to make install-cml2 do the right thing 
	  with relative installation paths.
	* The old menuconfig shortcut that 'm' in a boolean entry field
	  sets 'y' is now implemented. 
	* Simplified color scheme.
	* Added fast-mode command to suppress side-effect computation 
	  on slow machines.
I'd appreciate it if some of you with slow machines would try running 
with fast mode on and seeing if that addresses the sluggishness.
