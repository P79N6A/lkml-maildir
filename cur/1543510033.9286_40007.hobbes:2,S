What I am doing is providing (giving) the source-code for the module
necessary to communicate with our proprietary hardware away. We WANT
customers to write other applications and the module (driver) is the API
to the hardware. The API could simply be written without a module, since
the hardware is memory-mapped. However, you'd lose the ability to
poll for completion (interrupts).
The other stuff (a network server that communicates with the API) will
probably be given away also.
Basically, my embeded system communicates as a server via GPIB, RS-232C,
and a TCP/IP socket. A monitor allows one to set the IP address, etc.,
and the port number as well as the GPIB address and the RS-232C baud-
rate. This is pretty simple stuff.
The most complicated stuff is booting from NVRAM, with a BIOS module that
replaces a boot-drive on startup. This is complicated because the NVRAM
chosen by the hardware engineers can only be read sequentially so the
virtual heads/sectors/cylinders have to be 'munged'. The NVRAM is
read as a sequential stream of bits (not even bytes) -- gawd they
make this difficult. Basically, I have 1 bit of assessible NVRAM.
It sits at the `game-port` address. 
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
