Looking closer, the problem aren't the FOO_CONSOLE options themselves, 
the problem is that with FOO_CONSOLE=n sunserial_console_match() still 
gets called.

If a module calls sunserial_console_match() that's an Oops.
I removed the EXPORT_SYMBOL(sunserial_console_match), and this is the 
result:
  MODPOST 136 modules
ERROR: "sunserial_console_match" [drivers/serial/sunzilog.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "sunserial_console_match" [drivers/serial/sunsu.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "sunserial_console_match" [drivers/serial/sunsab.ko] undefined!
-ENOHARDWARE, but looking at the code you could call me _very_ surprised 
if you manage to load a modular sunsab from 2.6.24-rc6 on a machine with 
the hardware without getting an Oops.
