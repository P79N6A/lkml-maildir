It really would be nothing to invent, and that would be worth doing if
the notifier.h isn't quite right for this jon.

I tried plugging headphones into one, and the output was horrible.  I'm
surprised, because through the sound card, via two unshielded cables
draped across the whole computer, it sounded pretty good.
Another drive doesn't have a headphone socket or volume control.
Just a play button, oddly.

I was thinking of a specific drive, the one I have at work.  It's an
idea drive.  All cd player apps with a volume slider, ranging from 0% to
100%, give this behaviour: 0% == no sound, 1-99% == fixed volume.

Precisely.  You'd want the specific volume from the application that's
calling the uniform CD-ROM layer, so you can pass it to the audio mixer
in the case that the drive only supports on/off.
So my question is: can you detect the difference between a drive that
only does on/off and a drive that has its own volume control?
have a nice day,
