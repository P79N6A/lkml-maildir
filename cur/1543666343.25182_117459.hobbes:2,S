Hmm. I'm just trying to spawn enough tasks to keep the cpus busy to get
a large enough thread pool to have something to run when someone sleeps.
There's enough idle time now that this sounds like the wrong direction
to move the task count in...

Why? The adapter is "vaguely modern" (actually acquired as part of a
hunt for an HBA w/a less buggy driver) but the box and disks and so on
are still pretty ancient, so the absolute numbers aren't useful.
To get a real comparison we'd have to compare spindles, HBA's, and
cpus, and attempt to factor them out. The disks are actually only
capable of doing 30MB/s or 40MB/s, the buses can only do 40MB/s, and
the cpus are 700MHz P-III's. Where dbench gets its numbers faster than
wirespeed I have no idea...
This locking issue may just need more cpus to bring out.

I'll have trouble as there won't be enough tasks to keep the cpus busy.
Why do you think reducing the client count gets io out of the picture?
Why do you think reducing the client count will reduce idle time?

Sorry, 1s.

Well, the timer interrupt is a killer. 1KHz*num_cpus_online() blows
goats for sufficiently large num_cpus_online(), but for some reason
things are slower without it. I suspect that scheduling response
time is somehow dependent on it.
I got a hold of an aic7xxx so io throughput is slightly better than my
usual NUMA-Q runs (i.e. oopsen). The disks are still clockwork, though.
