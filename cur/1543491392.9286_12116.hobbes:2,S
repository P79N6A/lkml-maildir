I believe Larry is talking about tar as a concept, rather than an 
implementation (from earlier posts).  Basically 'an archiver, such as tar'.
Also, consider 'tar b 1' is a valid use of tar (the option b specifies the
blocking factor in 512 byte blocks, default is 20).  Even if you were 
compressing, if you were actually using tar as the file format, you'd probably 
want --block-compress (block the output of compression program for tape use)
to hopefully avoid some fragmentation horror from a completely non-blocked 
format.
David.
