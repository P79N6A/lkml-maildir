If you have a Pentium you may care to look at the timepeg code at
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/
 - this will provide you with the
measurement tools.

The network send path is quite complex.  This rather depends on
precisely what you're trying to do.  You could simply drop a timepeg in
(for example) sys_sendto() and then another in your driver's
hard_start_xmit() method.  Or you could dive in the middle somewhere
like net/ipv4/ip_output.c:output_maybe_reroute().

That's a bit tricky because there's no way that software can tell the
time interval between the hardware's interrupt assertion and the entry
to the ISR (interupts may be blocked somewhere). The best you can do is
to put a timepeg at the start of the driver's Rx ISR and others at the
various points of interest back up through netif_rx().
