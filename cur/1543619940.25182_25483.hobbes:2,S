In net/ipv4/netfilter/ipfwadm_core.c on lines like 691, 735, and a few
others there's an incorrect call to MOD_INC_USE_COUNT and
MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT.  That macro is being called incorrectly and causes the
compiler to get confused.  I think what the author meant to do was
'MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT' (which implies THIS_MODULE) but (s)he really did
MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT().
At any rate, shall I submit a patch to fix this typo or has someone
already patched this?
