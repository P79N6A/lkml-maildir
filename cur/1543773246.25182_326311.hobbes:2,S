Yes, git creates tar-archives that use the extended pax headers, and I 
think you need tar-1.14 to fully understand them. They should not hurt 
(apart from the warning) on older versions of tar.
The extended header just contains a hidden comment record that tells the
git commit ID that was used to generate the tar-tree.
Because it's extracted as a regular file (instead of tar knowing that it's 
a comment header), you will now have a file called "pax_global_header" 
that has the contents
	52 comment=9ee1c939d1cb936b1f98e8d81aeffab57bae46ab
in it (where "9ee1c939d1cb936b1f98e8d81aeffab57bae46ab" is the git SHA1
name of the Linux-2.6.12 commit).
So it's not entirely "harmless" in that it causes a bogus file to be
created, but it's not like it's a huge problem either, and that bogus file
actually does contain real information (although it's not useful unless
you're a git user).
