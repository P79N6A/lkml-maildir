Hi.
I've merged the latest version of the radix-tree pagecache patch
into my 2.4.19-pre4-ac2 kernel. The patch includes nearly all the
modifications listed in the following message ...
http://asimov.lib.uaa.alaska.edu/linux-kernel/archive/2002-Week-12/0188.html
The radix-tree patch was first merged back at 2.4.19-pre3-ac6, then had
a few modifications made to it at the suggestion of one of the
initial patch authors. I've been using it since then on my
machine without trouble, and know at least one other person
has used it successfully. So know it's time to post it to
the kernel mailing list and see what happens ...
My thanks to everyone working on the kernel and the authors
of the radix-tree pagecache. Enjoy!
