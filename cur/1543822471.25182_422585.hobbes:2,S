Few reasons:
1) I added .aio_read/.aio_write methods for all the filesystems that
are not currently having this, just to make their .read/.write to
do_sync_*().
2) Its just not possible for filesystems ONLY to provide
only .aio_read/.aio_write() interfaces. They have to have .read/.write()
also to handle direct callers :(
3) sys_read/sys_write() will now have an extra indirection:
	sys_read() -> vfs_read() -> do_sync_read() -> .aio_read()
where as current code..
	sys_read() -> vfs_read() -> .write()
We now have an extra do_sync_read() code, but may be okay.

Okay. I will take your word for it - I won't bother trying for now :)

I need to take a closer look at generic_file_write_nolock() since I
couldn't eliminate it easily in my first dumb pass. I will also look
at cleanups you suggested. Thanks.
Thanks,
