Thanks for the report.  If you are using 10base2 that's definitely a
bug.
Can you please change DE_DEF_MSG_ENABLE in de2104x.c as shown below, and
[privately] e-mail me /bin/dmesg and "lspci -vvv" output?
-#define DE_DEF_MSG_ENABLE       (NETIF_MSG_DRV          | \
-                                 NETIF_MSG_PROBE        | \
-                                 NETIF_MSG_LINK         | \
-                                 NETIF_MSG_TIMER        | \
-                                 NETIF_MSG_IFDOWN       | \

-                                 NETIF_MSG_TX_ERR)
+#define DE_DEF_MSG_ENABLE       0xffffffff
