Glad you've seen why I put the uninterruptible sleep logic in there. In 
essence this is why the NFS client interactive case is not as nice - the NFS 
code doesn't do "work on behalf of" a cpu hog with the TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE 
state. The uninterruptible sleep detection logic made a massive difference to 
interactivity when cpu bound tasks do disk I/O.
Cheers,
