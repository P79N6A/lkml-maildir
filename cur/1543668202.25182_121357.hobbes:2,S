The system in question is actually SMP but currently running with a 
single CPU because of a fan failure. So I think that option is enabled
by default. 
In fact it was a dumb error on my side. I did /not/ enable PIIX_TUNING
while I was sure I did. With that option the kernel configure the bus
just fine for whatever DMA the board supports. 
Currently I got another problem: When rebuilding the raid5 it fails
with an I/O error. The IDE message is not very helpful but it seems
the second disk in the raid is defective. But I guess I am down to 
pure hardware problems.
Thanks, Guys
