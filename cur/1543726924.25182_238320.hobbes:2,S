So that's where we vehemently disagree - it fits the kernel role, if you
allow it to control policy all of a sudden. And it's not easy, unless
you do it per specific device (not just type, make and model).

Until there's a new valid command for some device, in which case you
have to update your kernel?

Sorry, I think this model is totally bogus and I'd absolutely refuse to
merge any such beast into the block layer sg code.
