Adding a new counter to a vma may cause a bouncing cacheline etc. I 
would think that such a counter is far more expensive than occasional 
scans through the page table because someone is curious about the 
number of page in use. /proc/<pid>/numa_maps also uses these scans to 
determine dirty pages etc.
