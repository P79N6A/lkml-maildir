Hi,
Is this still broken?  How do you test it?
In 2.6.0-testN I can change [current] console_loglevel via:
echo 7 > /proc/sysrq-trigger
or
Alt-SysRq-8
or
echo "9 4 1 7" > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
The latter form can also change any of
  (current console_loglevel, default_message_loglevel,
   minimum_console_loglevel, default_console_loglevel}
and is the only way that I know of to change the latter 3 of these.
