Thanks for drawing my attention to this function. It's where the
proc_info functions are called from. Unless I am mad, its logic is
either weird or incorrect. It certainly needs attention. But ...
just setting start to the number of bytes returned each time seems
to do the trick for me. No patching required. Full data returned
and no truncation. I don't completely see why. That section
of code is awful!
