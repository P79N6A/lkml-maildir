Sorry, I wrote that late at night and quickly. I should have said 
"design decision" rather than "limitation," For systems which don't do 
multiple kernels it's not an issue.
I certainly would not have made the same decision, but I didn't write 
the code. It seems more robust to save everything than to try to 
identify what has and hasn't changed in a modular kernel.
