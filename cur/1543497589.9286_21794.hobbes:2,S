If the CPU can queue posted writes for the data and is still able to feed
itself without stalling, and there is enough bandwidth left for any other
bus masters _in the unlikely event it hits main memory_ then the write is 
pretty cheap. Since we are going to want the data again for the actual
I/O transaction in most cases its extremely close to zero cost.
