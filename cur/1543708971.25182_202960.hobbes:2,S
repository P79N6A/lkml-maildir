Working from the premise that there is a current (old-style with mostly 
chip dependent code), libsensors has 2.4 /proc support, and each 
specific release supports one of 2.6.[0123]...
I'm glad I'm not the maintainer of libsensors for a distribution.  Since 
you have effectively pushed the compatibility work to them.  Just think 
of angry customer complaints about this. :(
Since there is going to be an effective libsensors-new library with chip 
independent code, I suggest you put the compat code into the old library.
