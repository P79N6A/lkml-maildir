In fact I think it's pretty good solution :-) You need ability to
distingush /dev/pts/0 , /dev/vc/0 and [perhaps] /devfs/x/y/z/0 or
/usb/A/B/C/0 while retaining compatibility with old scheme (where
/dev/tty1 is just tty1 ). It works:
/dev/tty1      => tty1
/dev/pts/0     => pts/0
/dev/vc/0      => vc/0
/devfs/x/y/z/0 => /devfs/x/y/z/0
/usb/A/B/C/0   => /usb/A/B/C/0
All is pretty clear: if your device is in /dev then strip /dev and use
path relative to /dev, if not - use full name. To me it looks better then
any other scheme (it's possible to make a clash if you'll create
/dev/devfs/x/y/z/0 AND you'll use /dev//devfs/x/y/z/0 in inittab; in this
situation answer is simple: DON'T DO IT! And if you are using full
canonical pathnames clash is not possible anymore with ANY structure of
device names).
