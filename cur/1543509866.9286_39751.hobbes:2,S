.config attached...
I agree with the assessment that the driver gets into a mode where it doesn't
deliver 'data sent' events or something similar.  When this happens, I've noticed
that while using remote connections (always with ssh (1) for me) that I must cause
new data to be sent to get the previously sent data.  I have to work a line behind
where it's currently at.
This also may explain occasional delays in completing web requests.  I suppose I
can just test for this and cycle the interface/routes, but this is obviously very
unsatisfactory.
