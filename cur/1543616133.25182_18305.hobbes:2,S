I would add that preemption simply gives a felling of more speed with
interactive usage (with one single user on the system), and also has some
advantages for dedicated servers, but except of those conditions it never
showed in my experience to be a real and decisive advantage.
Of course we are supposing that the preemptive scheduler is very well
done, because otherway (bad working scheduler) there is nothing worse than
preemption.

agreed. Obviously this choice depends on what you want to do with your
system. If you have more than a couple of interactive users (and here I
have also 50 interactive users at the same time on every single system),
preemption is not what you want, period. If you have a desktop system,
well, it is a different situation.
