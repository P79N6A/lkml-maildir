A little question. AFAIK Linux needs less memory than FreeBSD. The new
FreeBSD like VM will casue Linux won't work on little machines which
uses Linux at our Univ because they're too powerless for running FreeBSD
(the pervious sysadm ran FreeBSD everywhere and only that machines couldn't
run FreeBSD as fast as Linux).
