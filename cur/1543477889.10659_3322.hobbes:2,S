On 2.2.0pre6, I managed to create a raid1 device with /dev/hdd1 
and /dev/sda4, I mount it on /mnt, and was able to mount /dev/sda4 
on /mnt2.
And all changed done in /dev/sda4 wasn't visible on /dev/md0,
after removing all files on /dev/sda4, I umounted /dev/sda4 and
/dev/md0 didn't complain. I could umount and mount it, it could
see mirrors where not in sync. All files deleted on /dev/sda4 are 
still present on /dev/md0. 
I had to run ckraid to resync md device,
