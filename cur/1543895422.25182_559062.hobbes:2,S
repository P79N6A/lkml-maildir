You can bound the worst case on this and I think stay within the specs
(as the specs don't say a lot about it). One way would be to make
unix_gc() kick off a thread/tasklet and if the last unix_gc was within 5
seconds then use a timer to defer it - that prevents any user driven
"lets cause a ton of gc" cases.
