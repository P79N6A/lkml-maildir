    Hi Marcelo!
Yes, I have been testing them with userspace applications (most notably 
User Mode Linux).
The following program's output gets truncated on a pty running on a normal
kernel, but works fine when the patch is applied:
   www.corewars.org/pollout.c
Also, the version I'd sent you earlier did not have a fix for serial.c, which
exhibits the same problems. I've posted another version earlier today which 
includes this as well as a minor change to the second bug fix.
Please use the new version instead of the earlier one.
      Cheers,
    Sapan
