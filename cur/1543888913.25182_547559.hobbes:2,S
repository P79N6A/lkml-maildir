yep. The correct patch is the one below.

Subject: Prevent going idle with softirq pending
From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>
 
The NOHZ patch contains a check for softirqs pending when a CPU goes 
idle. The BUG is unrelated to NOHZ, it just was made visible by the NOHZ 
patch. The BUG showed up mainly on P4 / hyperthreading enabled machines 
which lead the investigations into the wrong direction in the first 
place.  The real cause is in cond_resched_softirq():
 
cond_resched_softirq() is enabling softirqs without invoking the softirq 
daemon when softirqs are pending.  This leads to the warning message in 
the NOHZ idle code:
 
t1 runs softirq disabled code on CPU#0
interrupt happens, softirq is raised, but deferred (softirqs disabled)
t1 calls cond_resched_softirq()
	enables softirqs via _local_bh_enable()
	calls schedule()
t2 runs
t1 is migrated to CPU#1
t2 is done and invokes idle()
NOHZ detects the pending softirq
 
Fix: change _local_bh_enable() to local_bh_enable() so the softirq
daemon is invoked.
 
Thanks to Anant Nitya for debugging this with great patience !
