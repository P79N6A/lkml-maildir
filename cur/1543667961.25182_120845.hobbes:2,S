I ended up finding a solution to my problem myself, so I will post it
here for the record.
First, a summary of the problem I had with kernel 2.4.20-ac2 and
2.4.21-pre5-ac2 and Lilo 22.4:

The problem turned out to be a combination of LILO and an apparently
buggy BIOS. 
I switched from using LILO to using GRUB as a boot loader, and the
problem went away.  I found that loading a kernel with SYSLINUX (from
CDROM), LoadLin (from DOS), PXE (over the net) all works fine.  It is
only when loading it with LILO when the CRC error appears.  I read
somewhere on the net that the problem may be related to a buggy BIOS in
the machine.   
The problem was the USB keyb + buggy BIOS + LILO + large kernel    
(apparently this does not happen on small kernels, as I read somewhere
else on the net).
cheers,
