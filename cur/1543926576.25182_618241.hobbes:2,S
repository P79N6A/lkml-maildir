There is no assembly code required. I overdid it in the patch that I sent 
you trying to make sparc64 use large mappings like x86_64 NUMA. You really 
do not need that. Look at the IA64 and i386 configurations. There is no C 
code required. The x86_64 code only adds some special C code for the NUMA 
case.

VMEMMAP is something different from the cpu allocator. All MMU platforms 
have vmalloc support and you even suggested the use of vmalloc.
