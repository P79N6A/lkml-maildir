Ah, I bet you didn't live through the truly atrocious 3Com drivers of
the past. ;)  The new 3Com stuff seems passable for desktops, but having
been bitten dozens of times, I'm about 4^4^4^4 times shy.

Haven't had any issues at all with eepro100 or e100 under production
load for years.  Since Tulip went out of the mainstream (poor Digital)
the EtherExpress has been the most stable everywhere I've been.  I've
written too many scripts for 3Com boxes that grep dmesg for "fatal"
errors and unload/reload the 3com module.

Yes, and the fact that it "can't" be compiled-in.

That's all logged (dmesg, etc), if not distinctly queryable.  Don't the
iANS tools allow this functionality, and more?

Uhm, "nobody" is certainly not the proper word in this context.  We've
pulled many 3Com cards because of issues, including ARP deafness,
overruns, hangs, etc.  I have fully-saturated IDS systems running
eepro100 and e100 without issue, so heavy use may be necessary but is
not sufficient.
Oh, and six years of production on hundreds of EtherExpress NICs with
zero (0) issues.  Obviously, not everyone sees every bug, but the
preponderance of evidence I've seen in production environments puts the
EE way ahead of 3Com.  3Com for Windows desktops works just fine.
I'd like to try existing Tulip hardware though for another option.
Though 8139too seems to work well.
