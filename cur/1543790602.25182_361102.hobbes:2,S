Obviously it needs an DBUS over netlink interface with an user space daemon to open 
a window on the desktop. Then the user needs to click ok to make sure they 
understood they did something wrong (either by buying broken hardware or by simply 
typing).
You get bonus points when that window first opens another window with a "Did you 
know ..." message with a little dancing pink penguin that gives you helpful tips 
regarding typing on keyboards and offers you links to buy new keyboards on the web.
Wouldn't that be great?
