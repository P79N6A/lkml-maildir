Greetings,
While testing 2.6.0-test2-mm3-1, I ran into a problem with artsd failing 
during X/KDE startup, leaving an error message "cpu overload, 
aborting".  It takes about 20 seconds to fail, and after X finally does 
come up, all seems well with the exception of artsd being AWOL.  (I don't 
know what artsd has to do with sound, but whatever it is, it doesn't seem 
to be terribly important, because xmms seems to work fine without 
it)  After the initial failure, dropping back to the shell and restarting 
X/KDE _usually_ results in artsd starting just fine, though once in a while 
I'll get the same hang and failure that I always get the first time around.
Using the "brute-ignorance" method (pick something at random, patch -R it), 
I narrowed it down a little.  Exactly what I reverted is attached for 
reference.  Box is a piii/500 with an onboard ymf-740c, and I'm using oss 
emulation.
