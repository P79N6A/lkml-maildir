That still leaves the initialization issue. The link pointers need to all 
be initialized at SG allocation time (and not just the last one for the 
case where it's a linked entry).
And if you initialize them at allocation time, does an allocation ever get 
re-used without being free'd in between (if it does, you do indeed need to 
initialize the non-link pointers each time - but I don't see it being the 
case, so ..)
