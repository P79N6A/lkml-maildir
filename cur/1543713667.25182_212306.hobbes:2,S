UID is stored in a task structure in the kernel as
well as what to do with it. With VXE both policy and
capability are in a file (out of the kernel), though
there is an option to preload it into the kernel
before execution of particular system starts.

I though I did. Here is a link to the site with
detailed description of the system. It works since
1999. - 
http://vxe.quercitron.com
It's not an example - it's working system.
There was an article in LinuxFocus - it's less
technical and more compact -
