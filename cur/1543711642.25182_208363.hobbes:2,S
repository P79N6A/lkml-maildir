It's a live lock, not a deadlock. I didn't wait more than a few minutes
every time before declaring the kernel broken and rebooting the machine.
still if the prio_tree fixed my problem it means at the very least it
reduced the contention on the locks a lot ;)
It would be curious to test it after changing the return 1 to return 0
in the page_referenced trylock failures?
the results looks great, thanks.
what about the cost of a tree rebalance, is that O(log(N)) like with the
rbtrees?
