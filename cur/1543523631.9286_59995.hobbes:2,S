Hi,
 I was looking at sys_modify_ldt, and the comments
basically say that if a "cloned" thread uses 
sys_modify_ldt when the parent "bootup" thread has not
done anything with the ldt until then, strange things 
can happen. i.e., if cloned threads want to use the 
ldt, the parent has to touch the ldt _before_ doing
any clone. But from the code and the comments, I felt
that sys_modify_ldt will not cause a problem even when
the parent has not touched the ldt, _if_ we are 
running on a Uni-machine.  On an SMP machine, I can 
see how this is an issue, but  on a Uni, things should
work fine just the way it is. Am I right?
Thanks a lot in advance
