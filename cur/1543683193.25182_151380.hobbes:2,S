Nope. Kernel strlcpy implementation is crap and I do not believe that there
is single place in the kernel which can live with current implementation. 
Take a look at 
ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/src/lib/libc/string/strlcpy.c
 
or at 
http://www.courtesan.com/todd/papers/strlcpy.html
 - it copies
at most size-1 characters. Nothing about characters beyond specified size 
in the article.
Kernel should use strnlen() to get string length, if coding loop like
OpenBSD does is unacceptable.
