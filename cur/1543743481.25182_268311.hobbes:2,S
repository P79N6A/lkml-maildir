Ick, no new sysctls please.  Make this a per-bus attribute that gets
written to in sysfs.  Much nicer and much finer control then.

Make this a different sysfs file.  "rescan" would be good.
Look at how pci can handle adding new devices to their drivers from
sysfs.  If we can move that kind of functionality to the driver core, so
that all busses get it (it will require a new per-bus callback though,
se the other patches recently posted to lkml for an example of this),
that would be what I would like to see happen.

How does a device know what drivers could be bound to it?  It's the
other way around, drivers know what kind of devices they can bind to.
Let's add the ability to add more devices to a driver through sysfs,
again, like PCI does.

No, do it the other way, attach a driver to a device.
thanks,
