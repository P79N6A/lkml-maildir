Must be some of your changes, end_that_request_last is the one that
increments the index and that is not called for loop requests.

Well that change has absolutely zero impact on loop, so you cannot
possibly see any changes from that. Besides, _if_ it would have an
effect you did not limit the segment size to 512 bytes -- there is no
splitting going on, so you would still receive up to 4k of data at the
time per segment.
