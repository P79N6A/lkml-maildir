Yes, true. In the part where I bias placements of unmovable pages at
lower PFNs, additional steps would need to be taken. Specifically, the
lowest block MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES used for movable pages would need to be
reclaimed for unmovable allocations.

It's simply more complex. I believe it's doable. The main plus going for
the zone is that it is a clearly understood concept and it gives hard
guarantees.
