I saw "no match for command buffer" interrupt storms when I was fixing 
up aic7xxx for S3. The problem was due to not reprogramming the address 
of our SCB's on resume. Needed to tell the card the base address for all 
the DMA structures.
Just to speculate about what would be required for swsusp: you probably 
need to be using a SCSI LLD that properly implements pci suspend/resume, 
which implies you need to make sure the card's DMA state machine is 
flushed and idle before suspend completes. I've got a patch that fixes 
this much up for aic7xxx. And my other midlayer-level patch may also 
help... What happens during resume is interesting. I think maybe the 
problem is not what the drive is expecting, but what the card's state 
engine is expecting when it tries to map commands to command buffers in 
DMA space.  Maybe you need to suspend the LLD from the context of the 
kernel that is doing the image load, and then resume from the context of 
the kernel that was just loaded.
Sounds like this is why Pavel is asking about DMA. So he'll need to 
manage calling the host adapter's suspend callbacks, not just 
generic_scsi_suspend. DMA base addresses are likely to change when you 
load the new kernel image

Right, though you also need to get the host adapter's struct device, if 
you're not already doing so, that is. Many IDE host drivers don't bother 
with suspend/resume callbacks at the pci_driver level, but SCSI needs 
callbacks because the BIOS usually doesn't handle things for us.
