Subject: ACPI C-States [Was: Re: [PATCH] i386 No Idle HZ aka dynticks 051217]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

A few improvements and bugfixes to the ACPI C-States management based on
what's already in your dyn-tick patchset:
- last_sleep needs to be per-CPU
- cx->time for C1-type sleep is meaningless, remove support for it.
- Add a fast-path demotion: if dynticks are enabled, we can relax a bit
  and use a more responsive sleep type if we're going to sleep only
  for a short period of time (<1 tick), as long as we get back to deep
  sleep soon (quick_promotion).
