Lots of devices don't need that delay, but enough of them do that we 
decided to add it.  The value of 5 seconds was more or less arbitrary; it 
was long enough for every device we could test and it didn't seem _too_ 
long.  Maybe 1 second would be long enough -- we just didn't know so we 
were conservative.
