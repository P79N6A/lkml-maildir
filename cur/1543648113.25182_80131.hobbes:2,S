The infrastructure in the docbook makefile has changed since 2.4.
Took a look in the journal-api.sgml file, based on the comments you gave.
I had to do a little more to crete .html without warnings.
I've submitted this to Linus and trivial.. as well.
Browsing the resulting file I wonder why there are references to several
jbd files, but they do not include docgen comments.
Are there some patches missing in 2.5 that updates the comments?
