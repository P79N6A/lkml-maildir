Clearly that is easy to work around, because all you need to do is have a 
small GPL wrapper module that includes the Linux kernel headers and would 
end up having GPL code linked into it, and build the wrapper such that it 
makes calls via an API *you* define into your code. Then your code is 
simply interfacing via your own API to the GPL wrapper module and none of 
your code would be tainted. 
At least via direct inclusion and use of Linux kernel API header files 
anyway. There is still the issue of whether the specific binary module 
code you are linking into the kernel is Linux specific or not and would 
be considered a dervived work. If it is only for Linux and is not very 
useful for other platforms, one could argue that it is a derived work and 
hence should be GPL regardless of what API or GPL wrapper it uses.
Then again, if a module is completely Linux specific and the source for 
it has no use outside of Linux, I doubt a vendor could care less about 
keeping it proprietary anyway ;-)
