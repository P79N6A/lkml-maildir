Yeah, it says 196, and that's bizarre.  196 whats?  From looking at other
example output, the '1441854' number is usually the true deg. C of the
machine.  But I'm reasonably sure that it's not at a million and a half
centigrade.
I can open the case up and put my hand on the drive.  It feels cooler to the
touch than the 10k SCSI drives in the next machine over...
Thanks though;
Erik
