Hi !
I'm unable to get multicast to work with the via-rhine driver.
Outgoing multicast works but no incoming multicast traffic
can be seen on the interface (I have verified this by snooping
from another machine on the same subnet).=20
Unicast seem to work as expected.
I'm having this problem with 2.2.12 and with 2.2.10
(the only two I've tested).
I've also tested with the v1.02b version of the driver with
the same result.
