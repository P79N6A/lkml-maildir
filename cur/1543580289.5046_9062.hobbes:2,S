Greetings. I've just procured myself a copy of 2.4.1, and tried to build
it. At the tail end of a make modules_install, the following error occurs:
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.1/kernel/drivers/md/md.o
depmod:         name_to_kdev_t
My first assumption was that this occurred because I'm running 2.2.15 with
a collection of patches. Except I've never seen this happen before with
upgrades.
Thanks,
jdm

Getting a SCSI chain working is perfectly simple if you remember that
there must be exactly three terminations: one on one end of the cable, one
on the other end, and the goat, terminated over the SCSI chain with
a silver-handled knife whilst burning *black* candles. --- Anthony
