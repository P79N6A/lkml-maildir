Subject: ANNOUNCE: [PATCH] Rewritten AX.25 for 2.3.9
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello all,
This announces public availability of the new, rewritten AX.25
implementation for linux-2.3. The patch has been sent to linux-kernel
already, however it contained a small bug that is corrected in this
release.
I've uploaded a fixed patch to 
ftp://ftp.hes.iki.fi/incoming,
 it should
be available at 
ftp://ftp.hes.iki.fi/pub/ham/linux/ax25
 soon. 
Caveat: This is not a drop-in replacement. It is supposed to break
stuff, namely device drivers for amateur radio hardware. Also some of
the ax25-utils (and netstat) will have to be modified. Contact me for
further information.
I'll also try to set up a webpage to report status and known issues with
this release. However my time is limited.
Gruss,
	Matthias
