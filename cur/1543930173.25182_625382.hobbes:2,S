The normal kexec based hibernation procedure is as follow:
1. kexec_load the kernel image and initramfs
2. jump to hibernating kernel
3. the normal boot process of kexeced kernel
4. jump back to hibernated kernel
5. execute ACPI methods
6. jump to hibernating kernel
7. write memory image of hibernated kernel
8. go to ACPI S4 state
With kimgcore:
A. Prepare a memory image of hibernation kernel:
A.1 kexec_load the kernel image and initramfs
A.2 jump to hibernating kernel
A.3 the normal boot process of kexeced kernel
A.4 jump back to hibernated kernel
A.5 save the memory image of hibernating kernel via kimgcore
The normal hibernate process is as follow:
1. kexec load the kimgcore of hibernatin kernel
2. jump to the hibernating kernel
3. execute ACPI methods
4. jump to hibernating kernel
5. write memory image of hibernated kernel
6. go to ACPI S4 state
So the boot process of hibernating kernel needs only once unless the
hardware configuration is changed.
