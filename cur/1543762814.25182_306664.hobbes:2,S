Eric,
I have some more interesting tests showing that it's not a matter
of hard real-time latency. Everyone here knows the vmstat program.
If I only start 2 'lat3 4000' programs in parallel, it literally
freezes vmstat for up to 7.7 seconds. That is, the simple program
designed to observe system activity becomes unusable, as shown
below. Starting 4 processes gets worse, pauses reach 8.3-11 seconds,
and it's very hard to stop them because the console responds at
the same speed.
What's more interesting is that vmstat sees more processes in the
runqueue than there really are : with 2 'lat3', we often see 4
processes. With 4 'lat3', we see between 0 and 7 processes. It's
just as if vmstat sees several times the same processes, or as if
the processes really appeared several times in the queue.
$ ./lat3 4000 >/dev/null & ./lat3 4000 >/dev/null &
$ vmstat 1

The 'in' column shows the number of interrupts since the previous line. As the
system timer is at 1 kHz, it shows that when the system does nothing, vmstat
sleeps 1 second between each line. When I start the two processes above, I get
long pauses, up to 7.7 seconds.
I will not copy the 4 process output, I will not be able to get access to
the machine and will have to sysrq-k it.
Cheers,
Willy
