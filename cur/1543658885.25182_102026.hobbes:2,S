I consider them to be old drivers, the same way "hd.c" was. Not
necessarily useful for most people, but neither was hd.c. And it was
around for a _long_ time (heh. I needed to check. The config option is 
still there ;)
So I don't see a huge reason to remove them from the sources, but we might
well make them harder to select by mistake, for example. Right now the
config help files aren't exactly helpful, and the OSS choice is before the
ALSA one, which looks wrong. 
They should probably be marked deprecated, and if they don't get a lot of 
maintenance, that's fine.
