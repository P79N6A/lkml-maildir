i didnt want to add it to thunk.S because right now it would cause an 
unnecessary slowdown for the slowpath, by quite a number of 
instructions: due to the indiscriminate register-saving/restoring done 
in thunk.S.
even though it's a "slow path" relative to the fastpath, we shouldnt 
slow it down unnecessarily. So if someone wants to play with more 
inlining later on, this has to be done in context of that effort.
