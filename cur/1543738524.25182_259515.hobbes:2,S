hi,
Now that readw(), writew() etc family of routines are inline
functions, looks like this change
has resulted in gcc spewing out lots of warnings about not type
casting the args for these
routines.
is typecasting all the concerned args to (void __iomem *) the only
solution to this ? if yes,
there are a lot of places to fix this in the drivers/ subdir. I can go
ahead and submit a patch.
did i miss anything by the way ???
