Of course they should do something to make spoofing their bots useless.
Adding such sites to blacklist look good. Perhaps they should add way to
find out what's wrong with particular host: is it relay or is it ORBS
blocking host. I will not use such information (to me rlaying and spoofing
ORBS bots are equil) but someone will.

They are supposed to be list of open relays. The only way to make such list
usefull you MUST do something for peoples who spoof bots. Adding spoofers in
blacklist looks great for me, but perhaps it should be separate list...

And I do not want to hear then then I have my reasons :-) ORBS can not force
anyone to use it.
