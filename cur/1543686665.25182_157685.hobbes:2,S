Then how am I getting infinitely repeating keys with a USB keyboard? I
recently switched to a kinesis ergo USB keyboard, and I had to disable
autorepeat in X because I had problems with keys occasionally repeating
infinitely until I hit something else to make it stop. I haven't tracked
down whether that's a hardware problem or in software.
Are you aware of that happening with USB keyboards?
