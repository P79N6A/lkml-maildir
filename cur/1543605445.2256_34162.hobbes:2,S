Subject: Is writing to /dev/ramdom a security flaw (vserver project)

I have announced a project (see my signature) to run several virtual servers
on a single box (single kernel as well). The vservers are real linux distribution
running in a chroot/chbind/chcontext and capability limited environment.
While looking at the kernel we found out that writing to /dev/random is
not controlled by any capability. We are providing a /dev/random in
the vservers with permission 644, so it can be used.
Is this a security issue if an administrator of a vserver is allowed to write
in /dev/random ?
Looking at the source, it seems that it just increase the entropy and should
not be an issue. I am no expert in randomness.
If this is an issue, then a capability must exist to limit that (CAP_SYS_ADMIN
I guess).
Thanks!
