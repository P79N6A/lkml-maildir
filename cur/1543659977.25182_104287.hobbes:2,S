It doesn't require that you distribute the tools for editing the
source, though.  For example I believe it is fine to distribute a
program for Microsoft Visual Studio, in the form of the files you
would actually use with Visual Studio, even though the format of some
of those files is not documented.

I disagree, because the BK file format is actually quite well
documented - it is SCCS with some annotations that do not seem
essential if you are using a different tool.
The data is easily extracted using an SCCS-compatible tool.  It is
certainly not encrypted, and I had no difficulty writing a Perl script
to extract any version of the source, although I have yet to look if
changesets are so easy as individual files.
Credit to Larry, for choosing an easily read file format.
(Although not perfectly - see the CSSC documentation for some things
that they are not sure how to decode in an SCCS file - and yes, those
do appear in BK-generated SCCS files from time to time).

Linus and other people have said repeatedly that BitKeeper is _not_
essential to working with them on the kernel.
That said, it does seem that if you can't read bkbits.net, then you
are at a disadvantage sometimes.
