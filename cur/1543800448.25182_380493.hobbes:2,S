It's not about the GPL, it's simply a matter of fact that noone can 
debug a kernel if any binary-onluy module was ever loaded.
There have been too many problems in the past where after hours of 
debugging it turned out that it wasn't reproducible without the nvidia 
module.

A kernel module can do _anything it wants_ in the whole kernel.
If the nvidia module did something in a strange and completely 
unsupported way or if the nvidia module contained a bug that only
wasn't triggered before a bug might not be in the changed kernel.
In your case the bug was in the kernel, but who can debug such bugs?
We don't have the sources for the nvidia module.
The nvidia developers have the source of the kernel.
Guess who has the source of everything involved and can therefore 
debug the problem...
