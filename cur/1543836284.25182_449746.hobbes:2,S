You won't usually know, unless you run a consistency check: RAID-1 will
only read from one of the two drives for speed - except if you make the
system check consistency as it goes, which would imply waiting for both
disks at the same time. And in that case, you'd better look for drives
that allow to synchronize their platter staples in order to avoid the
read access penalty that waiting for two drives entails.

If it's decent and detects a bad block, it'll log it and rewrite it with
data from the mirror and let the drive do the remapping through ARWE.

Berkeley DB can, since version 4.1 (IIRC), write checksums (newer
versions document this as SHA1) on its database pages, to detect
corruptions and writes that were supposed to be atomic but failed
(because you cannot write 4K or 16K atomically on a disk drive).
