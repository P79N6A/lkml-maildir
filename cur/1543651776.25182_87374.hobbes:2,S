I got the same error, but on reboot, the journal was played and
then the fsck found no errors.
All I did on that filesystem was
	log in
	make modules_install in a kernel tree
	edit a file in the kernel tree (this file had at least two links)
	make modules - which discovered the files system read only.
After the reboot, the file was as I had changed it, so I lost nothing.
