Ok, thus you want to increase it from 32k to 64k, but not beyond, correct?
You'd have to check that there are no hidden signed/unsigned assumptions 
in ipc/sem.c

_If_ there are no signed/unsigned problems and if Oracle wants 64K, then 
I would increase SEMVMX to 64K, without making it tunable. Dito for SEMAEM.
