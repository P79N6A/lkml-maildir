Which structs are 'indexed' by the UID? If the quota_time_limits
are only stored once, you could better add them to the header
struct to have one header and many quota_blocks...

Isn't it possible to code the uid/gid in the struct too, this way
we dont have to write a 1GB(?) file for 2 users, one at UID0 and
one at UID 131072... Since this struct is read into memory-structs
some small handeling shouldn't really matter in performance...
