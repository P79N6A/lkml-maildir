umm linux kernel 2.5? Umm, given that a stable linux 2.6/3.0 might be
years away ... and this seems 'minor', wouldn't it be better to 
submit this as a teeny-weeny new kind of mouse device driver as a 2.4.x
patch?  e.g. CONFIG_MOUSE_PSAUX_SUPERSYNC or something?   I mean this
cant be more than a few hundred lines of code? Requireing no other
changes to the kernel?
