Unfortunatly, the memory is just fine.  Both 2.2 *and* two versions of
windows run just fine on the same machine, so it's probably not that.

Daniel:
Have you tried swapping in a different stick of RAM and/or running a
boot-time memory tester? Does it boot on 2.2 or any other OSs?
I had a problem like this once before - turned out one of the two 128MB
CAS2
modules were bad. I replaced it and 2.4 booted wonderfully.
Good Luck,
- Dave
