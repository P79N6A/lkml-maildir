OK,
I believe that this would look like the following on ptx (omitting all the
obvious stuff :-)
	lock_t bdflush_lock;
	sema_t bdflush_request;
	sema_t bdflush_waiters;
	...
	init_lock(&bdflush_lock);
	init_sema(&bdflush_request, 0);
	init_sema(&bdflush_waiters, 0);
	...
wakeup_bdflush(...)
{
	...
	(void) p_lock(&bdflush_lock, SPLBUF);
	v_sema(&bdflush_request);
	p_sema_v_lock(&bdflush_waiters, PZERO, &bdflush_lock);
}
bdflush(...)
{
	spl_t s;
	...
	s = p_lock(&bdflush_lock, SPLFS);
	vall_sema(&bdflush_waiters);
	v_lock(&bdflush_lock, s);
	if (!flushed || ...
	...
}
Once more, the use of p_sema_v_lock() avoids races.

The above hopefully elaborates a little. I'm more than happy to give further
details etc. assuming it's not boring everybody to tears :-)
I agree with you that your changes improve the readability significantly.
