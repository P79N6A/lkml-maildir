That's very cool. Thanks a lot.
Would it be possible to add 2.4.30 numbers and perhaps one or two 
distro kernels (let's say RHEL3/4, SLES8/9) to the graphs 
as data points for comparison? These are all very tuned
kernels and would show where mainline is worse than them.
Also how did you run netperf? Locally or to some other machine? 
Perhaps that should be documented.
Some oprofile listings from a few of the test runs would be also nice.
