Why don't you just have a private version of the macros?
syscall(2) is, again, a horrible botch -- on architectures which 
requires alignment for register pairs, the extra register buggers up the 
alignment.  One *can* work around it by making the syscall number 64 
bits, but I think it's safe to say that no libc does that currently.
