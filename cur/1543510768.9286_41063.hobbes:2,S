Hi,
For a very particular thing, I need to decompress a bzImage in order to
get the uncompressed kernel  ( I need an uncompressed kernel for a bootp
client on a linux bootp server, but I don't have enough place to store
two kernels on it : compressed and uncompressed, so I will uncompress
its kernel).
I take the bzImage, remove the bootsect.s and setup.s header to get the
compressed kernel. but I can't unzip it because the extracted kernel
does not begin with gzip magic number (0x1f,0x8b|| 0x9e). But it should
(if I look to arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c and gunzip() ).
Why ??
thanx for any clue or advice.
/pascal.
