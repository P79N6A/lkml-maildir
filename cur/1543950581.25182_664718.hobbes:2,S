Currently, it's like the following.
* Explicit unplug request via sysfs or whatever: ATA device stays online
till slave_destroy finishes.
* Hot unplugging: Nothing much libata can do.  ATA device is yanked out
by the user.
* Driver unload: Dealt the same way as hot unplugging.
Making driver unload like explicit unplug request is possible but it
will mean that drives will be spun down on driver unload, which can be
annoying to developers.  In addition, the code path is shared with
controller hot unplug in which case it's probably best not to issue any
new command.  So, I've been reluctant to make the change.  If the change
is required, I think it can be done by adding a few lines at the top of
ata_port_detach().  Jeff, what do you think?
