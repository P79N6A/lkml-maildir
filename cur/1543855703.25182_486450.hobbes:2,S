Let me change the subject of this thread.
I just read our private version of crashme. It's based on crashme
version 2.4 and add some logging capability, no other enhancement. So
it should be the same as crashme in LTP.
It is solidly reproducible within 3 minutes of running crashme.
The current status is: we know it's a commit between 2.6.16.4 and
2.6.16.5 that introduce this bug.
Our network is very slow(only 5-6K/second). So we'll start the
git-bisect tomorrow after finishing downloading the 2.6.16 stable git
tree.
Thanks,
Forrest
