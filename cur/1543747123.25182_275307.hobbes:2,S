Subject: odd behavior with r8169 and pcap

Hi all,
I'm seeing some very strange behavior with the r8169 driver
in 2.6.9. (Also observed in FC2's 2.6.5-1).
Throughput is generally dog slow, less than 100Mb/s. But if
I fire up any libpcap-based monitoring utility (ethereal,
iftop, etc) the throughput suddenly jumps an order of magnitude
to near 1Gb/s. As soon as I quit from the monitoring utility
the throughput drops back back to where it was before. This can
be repeated over an over.
I created a dummy libpcap monitoring program (below). This
is enough to trigger the behavior.
So the obvious questions are: Is this a known problem? Why the
heck does it do this? Is there a fix or workaround to get the
high rate all the time other than running a pcap utility 24x7?
Thanks,
Terry Griffin

    char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
    if( argc == 1 )
        iface = "eth0";
    else
        iface = argv[1];
    pd = pcap_open_live(iface,CAPTURE_LENGTH,0,1000,errbuf);
    pcap_loop(pd,-1,(pcap_handler)null_handler,NULL);
    return 0;
}
