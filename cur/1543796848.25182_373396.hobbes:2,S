Dave, the Orinoco is a wireless card that has a hardware MAC, plust
firmware. 
I do agree with Jiri that there basically is no support for softmac
devices in the ieee80211 code.
I'm also in favor of merging the devicescape code, but I don't see it
happening without somebody taking care to provide all the required
levels of interfaces (I see at least three levels of API's that a wireless
driver would need, depending on how much stuff is done in
hardware/firmware and how much in software.
I also think that there is a lack of knowledge on the architecture of
802.11 low-level protocols and drivers among many people (including
myself) in the network community.  Only this way I can explain why there
are always people who claim that the kernel already has a 802.11
'stack'.
