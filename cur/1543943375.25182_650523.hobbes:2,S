Subject: [x86_64] Cannot get the NMI watchdog to work

Please CC me when replying.
Kernel is a 2.6.24-rt1.
Summary:
- 0 NMI interrupts occur by default (this remains true for any
situation encountered).
- nmi_watchdog=1 disables lapic for some reason.
- I have no hpet it seems, hpet=force doesn't do any good (the oposite
actually).
- I never get any reference of hpet in my dmesg.
- oprofile module is not loaded.
- My interrupts seem to have IO-APIC-* mode.
- My chipset is a nvidia CK804.
Can anyone shed some light on what is needed to get a working NMI watchdog?
Sincerely,
Maarten Maathuis.
