If we turn idx in a signed int, isn't it true that
in kernel/trace/ftrace.c, line 806:
retry:
if (iter->idx >= iter->pg->index) {
	...
} else {
	iter->idx++;
	if ( a certain rec-> and iter->flags )
		goto retry;
}
since iter->pg->index is an unsigned long, when larger than INT_MAX this
could result in an endless loop?
