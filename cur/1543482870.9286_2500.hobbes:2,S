I promise to never release a patch without trying to compile the result.
Please accept my apologies!
Here's what I just posted:

My apologies, but the PPSkit-0.4.2.tar.gz needs a fix
(PPSkit-0.4.2.fix.gz) that is in the same directory. The fix is only a
few hundred bytes, but you need it after the patch from the kit.
Lame excuses: I was tried, it was late, I wanted to get it out, others
were waiting for it, I had already compiled a kernel and rebooted that
night, I thought the change made was trivial, I was thinking of
someone else, ...
Regards,
Ulrich
