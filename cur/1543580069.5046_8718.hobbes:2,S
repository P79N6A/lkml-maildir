Are you sure that it did not run out of horizontal sync, or something
like that? vesa:400 == vesa:0x190 == 1152x864/60Hz... And it powers
up in 60Hz, at least here ;-)
See timmings array in drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_base.c - all videomodes
except XXXx400 powerups in fv=60Hz unless you specified fh/fv/pixclock.
XXXx400 powerups with fv=70Hz, like standard VGA does.
