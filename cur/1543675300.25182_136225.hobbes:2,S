I believe it depends on what process happens to be current at time of
suspend. That can be randomly kernel thread or user process.
Some people use APM, some people use ACPI, and sometimes APM suspend
is triggered because of BIOS, sometimes because user said apm -s...

Yes, we want system to be similar state it was when we suspended, to
prevent heisenbugs.
