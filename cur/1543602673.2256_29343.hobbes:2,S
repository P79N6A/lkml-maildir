What is the status of tcp and nfs with the 2.4 kernel?  The sourceforge
site (regarding this) has not changed for a while and the NFS FAQ at 
sourceforge simply states:
nfsv3 over tcp does not work - the code for 2.4.x is as yet to be merged
What progress is being made toward this end?
Thanks,
Jamie Strandboge
