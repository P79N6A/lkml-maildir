So as for taking the proc_ prefix off I don't see a real problem with
that but that should really be a different increment patch.  Although removing
a little magic from my macros might be reasonable.
The only macro whose name really seems to terse is INF short for info,
so adding the O would be ok.  What I would really like to see however
is all of these proc info things just go away.  I seem to recall
they all have some pretty weird corner cases and a seq file implementation
is probably better there.
The other half of this is that I would very much like to see some of
these things moved out of base.c
