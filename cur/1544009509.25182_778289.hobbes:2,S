Replace paragraph with:
On newly created files, explicitely calling fsync on a file descriptor
for a directory is also needed, because calling fsync() on file does
not necessarily ensure that the entry in the directory containing the
file has reached disk.

I'd add:
After I/O error, fsync() only returns error condition to the first
process that finishes fsync(). Therefore special care must be taken to
coordinate different processes trying to write data to file/directory.
