What dual P4 motherboard(s) are actually working w/ linux 2.4.x-preN-anything?
For that matter, what single P4 motherboards are working well?
I downloaded 2.4.19-pre5 to look at the Documentation directory, but I 
don't really think found the info I need.
grep chipset * 
gives lots of info in Configure.help, is this the only location to look for
motherboard/chipset compatibility?
Searching the web for "linux hardware compatibility" turns up a lot of 
old (ca. 1997 - 2000) info.
Is there a better place to look?  Redhat, Suse, Mandrake h/w compat info
seems pretty thin on the ground for recent/new hardware.
thanks,
-chuck
