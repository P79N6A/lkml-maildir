Actually, the patch is wrong.  It will wreak havoc with SCSI's use of sysfs.  
The device_register has to be done in scsi_add_host, which is called after all 
the driver specific sysfs setup has been done.  The correct fix is to move the 
corresponding device_unregister into scsi_remove_host so that they match.
I've attached it below.  I'll also commit it to the scsi-misc-2.5 BK tree.
