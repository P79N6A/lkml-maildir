First! Fix your mailer. There wasn't a '\n' in the entire bunch
of text above. Unix/Linux people use the [Enter] key and don't
just auto-warp around the screen.

Well the "standard way" to start up a module is to allocate
resources for the module (like RAM), then register the module.
Then if the device isn't found, it's unregistered and the resources
freed. If the code to which you refer doesn't free its resources,
including unregistering if the device isn't found, then it's a bug.
Otherwise it doesn't make any difference. You can certainly probe
the PCI bus for your device first, and if it isn't found, you just
return -ENODEV or whatever. It's entirely up to you.
What is important is to make sure that you free any resources
that you acquired (like address space) if you decide not to
install the module. This makes it so you can write the module,
debug it, and add functionality without ever having to re-boot.
Cheers,
