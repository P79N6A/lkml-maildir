Subject: [PATCH 05/18] [PATCH] BLOCK: Don't call block_sync_page() from AFS [try #4]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/25/305

From: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
The AFS filesystem specifies block_sync_page() as its sync_page address op,
which needs to be checked, and so is commented out for the moment.
