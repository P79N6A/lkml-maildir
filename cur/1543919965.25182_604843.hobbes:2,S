That makes sense, but does it really make more sense to set-up proper
IOMMU translation tables for DMA's which have been triggered from the
first kernel than to either quiesce the device ASAP (this means before
enabling IOMMU translation...) or to trap such DMA's and continue,
rather than letting them go through?

I worry about two cases: the first is TCE table corruption, the second
is DMA's to areas which were fine in the first kernel but are wrong
for the second kernel.

We don't have a way to do that, but we should be able to trap the DMA,
figure out that we're in a kdump kernel, and then just ignore it and
continue.

That's a good point - how do PPC (or other architectures with an
isolation-capable IOMMU) handle this whole issue?
