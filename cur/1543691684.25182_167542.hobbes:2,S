Would this MCE message be of the same flavour as the one this
thread is about?
Message from syslogd@lexx at Mon Sep 22 21:38:01 2003 ...
lexx kernel: MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal, correctable incident occurred on CPU 0.
Message from syslogd@lexx at Mon Sep 22 21:38:01 2003 ...
lexx kernel: Bank 2: 940040000000017a
I don't have my stick of RAM plugged into the first RAM slot but rather
the 3rd of 4. I guess this correspends to bank 2 above. I've been ignoring
them uptil now but is this a linux hassle or a h/w one?
