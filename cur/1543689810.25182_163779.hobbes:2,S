Hello,
I have been testing swsusp to disk on my computer using kernel
2.6.0-test4 + Patrick Mochel's main PM patch (posted on lkml on aug 31) +
IDE PM fix from benh (posted on lkml by P. Mochel on sep 2)
I found that my computer is able to suspend to disk if I boot with
init=/bin/sh, but not with a normal boot. I tried swsusp with a normal
boot (Xfree, kde, ...) but after removing several modules form
/lib/modules, to see which modules make problems. What I found:
* swsusp doesn't like accelerated graphics. If the following modules are
  loaded:
    i830                   68120  20
    intel_agp              14744  1
    agpgart                25640  3 intel_agp
  resuming fails. (Different kind of failures, from spontaneous reboot to
  kernel panic.) I could try to pinpoint more precisely which module
  causes trouble.
* Apart from that, the computer can suspend and come back to life !
  Modules loaded:
    snd_mixer_oss          16768  3
    binfmt_misc             8200  1

    usbcore                91348  5 hid,ehci_hcd,uhci_hcd
  However, the mouse is not working anymore (mouse is usb, the only usb
  device connected) nor network on eth1 (I haven't tried eth0.)
  Here are the last lines of the log after resuming:

A last point; lates patch from P. Mochel (posted on Sep 3, supposed to
fix configuration with preempt enabled) completely prevents me from
suspending to disk.
