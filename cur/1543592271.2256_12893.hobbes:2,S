I suspect that bit can be fixed if need be. Its nice to keep a constant 
naming between cisco/ppp modes. cisco/ppp autodetect is also possible and would

Assuming this is a 'when 2.5 starts' discussion I'd like initially to keep the
syncppp api is but the pppd code going via generic ppp - and yes it would
break configs.
Clearly thats not 2.4 acceptable
