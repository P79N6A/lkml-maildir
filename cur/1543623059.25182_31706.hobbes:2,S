That's a good reason to object.

The patch turns on the reception for larger frames.
It only works for some chip revisions.  Specifically, the i82557 does
not document this bit.
It should have been handled like all of the other interface- and
chip-specific settings -- modifying a copy of the table, not
the original static table.

Have you tried sending slightly oversized non-VLAN frames?
What about testing with '557, '558 and '559 chips?  
I have a similar objection to the Tulip modification: the change
just disables the overlength packet protection.  This won't work as you
expect with all chips.

The reason for the magic numbers is twofold: I got the documentation only
with a negotiated NDA, and even with the documentation many of the bits
have specified-but-undocumented values.  Others bits are fundamentally
uninteresting modifications of standard Ethernet: disabling preamble,
extending the IFG1/IFG2 period, changing to linear back-off. 
OTOH, this patch is a case where the setting should be documented.  It is a
change from the default/recommended value.
