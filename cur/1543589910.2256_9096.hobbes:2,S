There are two cases where the substitution is problematic:
Array:
	char tmparray[500];
	strcpy(tmparray, str);
	/* for (p = strtok(tmparray, "n"); p; p = strtok(NULL, "n")) { */
	while ((p = strsep(&tmparray, ","))) {
This is clearly wrong, and invokes a compiler warning.  &tmparray ==
tmparray (a cute C oddity I've never really liked).  You are blowing
away the first few characters in tmparray, and your parser won't work
properly.
Dynamic:
	char *tmp = strdup(str);
	/* for (p = strtok(tmp, "n"); p; p = strtok(NULL, "n")) { */
	while ((p = strsep(&tmp, ","))) {
	...
	}
	kfree(tmp);
Here, tmp has changed in the strsep implementation, and kfree will do
bad things.
There is a real reason to avoid strtok, and that is SMP and multple
threads calling it at once (that said, I don't know of a problem yet).
But this patch is a step backwards.
Rusty.
