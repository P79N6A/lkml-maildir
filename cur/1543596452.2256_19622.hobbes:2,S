ext3 has three modes:
data=journal
	Data is journalled.  Yes, this slows things down
	significantly.
data=ordered
	The default mode and the most popular.  All data is written
	to disk prior to a commit.  Write throughput is good, and
	you don't have uninitialised data in your files after a
	crash.
data=writeback
	Metadata-only.   Better write throughput (in dbench, anyway),
	but only metadata integrity is preserved after a crash. ie:
	fsck says the fs is fine, but files can (and almost always do)
	contain random stuff after a crash.
Ordered data mode is really nice.  It's not magical though - for example,
if you reset the machine during a kernel build, a subsequent `make' will
fail because you have a number of .o files which have zero length.
That's the length they happened to have when the machine went down.
For ordered-data mode we need to keep track of all the buffers which
are associated with a transaction's journalled metadata and ensure that
they are written out before the transaction commits.  That is done with
a little structure which hangs off ->b_private.

Yup.  metadata-only journalling is all-round much, much simpler.
