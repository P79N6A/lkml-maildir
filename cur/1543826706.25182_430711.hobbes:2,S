Hi all,
How is it possible that on an IA64 machine, the address returned by
pci_map_single() is above 4G (32 bits) when I have only 2G of physical
memory?
The DMA mask is set to 64 bits (using pci_set_dma_mask()). When I change
it to 32 bit DMA mask, the problem goes away.
This problem does not appear on i388/x86_64 machines.
Thanks,
Adhiraj.
