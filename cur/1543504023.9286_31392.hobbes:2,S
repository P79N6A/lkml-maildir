But using a ("normal") workstation (even low end class) as a host
for a DSP might be a solution. You can run Linux there to do all
the OS stuff and just do "number-crunching" stuff and may be some
little scheduling or ISRs at the DSP.
This seems a reasonable solution to me, and there is some work in
progress to allow linux users to take advantage of these external
processing services a DSP offers.
