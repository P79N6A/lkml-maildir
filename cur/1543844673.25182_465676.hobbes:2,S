My way of handling this has been to wait until you've acted on my
first merge request before sending another one.  I also don't touch my
published "for-linus" branch in git until you've pulled it.  I just
batch up pending changes in my "for-2.6.19" branch until my next merge
(and I also encourage people interested in Infiniband to run my
for-2.6.19 branch)
If I do see you merging other trees (in "merge mode") and skipping my
merge requests, I'll send a gentle reminder of my first merge request.
