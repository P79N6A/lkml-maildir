Have a look at 
http://csua.berkeley.edu/~gam3/knfsd.
  You'll need to
download the NFS daemones etc. from there.
To get support for knfsd in the kernel you need to enable configuration
for experimental drivers and then you should have a few more options in
the Filesystems/Networked Filesystems configuration section.
I've not managed to apply the patches from the above WWW pages cleanly to
2.2.2ac7 yet, though it looks at first sight like they may be needed.
James.
