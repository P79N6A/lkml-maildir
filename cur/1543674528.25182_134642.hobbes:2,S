Serial APICs have always had a spl-like effect built into them.  The effective 
TPR value of a given local APIC is:
	max(TPR, highest vector currently in progress) & 0xF0
Parallel APICs don't do that because they don't have serial priority 
arbitration; instead they use the xTPRs in the bridge chips.
So, I suppose an argument could be made for setting the TPR to the vector 
number on entry of do_IRQ.  I don't think that would be a good idea.  It 
could interfere with IRQ nesting during a non-DMA IDE interrupt handler.  And 
of course, an IRQ's vector has little to do with the IRQ itself, thanks to 
the vector hashing scheme used to avoid the (stupid) 2 latches per APIC level 
HW limitation of most i586 and i686 CPUs.
