For the first time since 1997 I have a machine (Mac Mini) running a 
stock kernel which I am suspending/resuming for 2 days now without any 
problems. Amongst the various hardware and kernel versions that I've 
used so far this combination is the first to suspend/resume without issues!
But one thing that annoys me a bit is that the load averages spike up 
quite a bit after resume although it doesn't feel like the machine is 
loaded  -
Before Resume -
parag@parag-desktop:~$ uptime
 09:35:14 up  5:18,  2 users,  load average: 0.08, 0.87, 1.00
After Resume -
parag@parag-desktop:~$ uptime
 09:36:37 up  5:18,  2 users,  load average: 12.53, 3.83, 1.98
parag@parag-desktop:~$
Is this a known problem? Worth fixing?
Thanks
Parag
