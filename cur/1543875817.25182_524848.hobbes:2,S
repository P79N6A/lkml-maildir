Agreed, except about "probably as a system device".
Last I checked, there was no good reason to use sysdev suspend()/resume()
rather than platform_device suspend_late()/early_resume().  Which more
or less means no good reason to use sysdev in new code...
Also, making HPET use the legacy mode seems like a step backwards.
