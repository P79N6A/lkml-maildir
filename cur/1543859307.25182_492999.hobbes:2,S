I had a bug in my dev tree which got picked up by the patch
when I diffed against master:
-           scsi_end_request(cmd, 1, good_bytes, !!result) == NULL)
+           scsi_end_request(cmd, 1, good_bytes, result == 0) == NULL)
                return;
As james explained, the other chunk of the patch is still good.
