Subject: [PATCH 0/3] i386 VMI fix for lazy MMU bug, take 3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In light of objections to the original fix I proposed for lazy MMU
interactions between VMI and kmap_atomic in interrupt context, I
have an updated patch series.
The first is for 2.6.21; it is an urgent bugfix, please apply.
The second backs out the first; it is required to avoid conflicts
  with later work which has been done on the paravirt-ops code.
  It should be added to subsystem queues which are being held
  for 2.6.22.
The third illustrates the form the fix will likely take after the paravirt-ops
  queue is applied, but is for demonstration purposes only.
