That's not the same thing at all.
I think that David is suggesting that the reinsertion logic
should pretend that the task used up all of the CPU time it
was offered in the slot leading up to the sched_yield() call.
If it did that, then the task would be far more likely not to
end up as the next task chosen to run.
Without doing that, the task is highly likely to be chosen
to run again immediately, as it will appear to have done
nothing since it was previously chosen -- and so the same 
criteria will result in it being chosen again, and again,
and again, until it finally wastes enough cycles to not
be reinserted into the "currently active" slot of the tree.
