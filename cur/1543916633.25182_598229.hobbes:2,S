Yes, it has to be integrated into the build system, no doubt.
We really need to give Mathieu and David Wilder an answer so that they
can make progress (and I'm willing to help with this).
To do this, here's my test question:
How much of David's "trace code and documentation" patch can be put
into a samples/ directory?
 Documentation/trace/src/Makefile     |    7 +

All of the trace/src/ subdirectory?
