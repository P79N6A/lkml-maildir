I have the impression 2.6 builds are more convenient, if not faster (sorry, no
hard data around due to ccache).
Perhaps you need to start using ccache (but that's true for building 2.4.x,
too)?
BTW, _if_ the build system got much slower, people who use ccache a lot would
notice, since the relative impact of the build system on the build time is
higher when using ccache.

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
