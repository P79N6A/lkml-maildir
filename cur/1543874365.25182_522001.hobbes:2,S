I don't _think_ there's anything funny in my system, and Con said it was
the expected behavior with my testcase, but I won't rule it out.
Moving right along to the bugs part, I hope others are looking as well,
and not only talking.
One area that looks pretty fishy to me is cross-cpu wakeups and task
migration.  p->rotation appears to lose all meaning when you cross the
cpu boundary, and try_to_wake_up()is using that information in the
cross-cpu case.  In pull_task() OTOH, it checks to see if the task ran
on the remote cpu (at all, hmm), and if so tags the task accordingly.
It is not immediately obvious to me why this would be a good thing
though, because quotas of one runqueue don't appear to have any relation
to quotas of some other runqueue.  (i'm going to it that this old
information is meaningless)
