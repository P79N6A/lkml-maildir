i checked that bit
http://www.openbios.org/viewvc/trunk/LinuxBIOSv2/src/northbridge/amd/amdk8/coherent_ht.c?revision=2596&view=markup
static void enable_apic_ext_id(u8 node)
{
#if ENABLE_APIC_EXT_ID==1
#warning "FIXME Is the right place to enable apic ext id here?"
      u32 val;
        val = pci_read_config32(NODE_HT(node), 0x68);
        val |= (HTTC_APIC_EXT_SPUR | HTTC_APIC_EXT_ID | HTTC_APIC_EXT_BRD_CST);
        pci_write_config32(NODE_HT(node), 0x68, val);
#endif
}
that bit only be should be set when apic id is lifted and cpu apid is
using 8 bits and that mean broadcast is 0xff instead 0x0f.
for example 8 socket dual core system or 4 socket quad core
system,that you should make BSP start from 0x04, so cpus apic id will
be [0x04, 0x13)
So if you want to enable that in early_quirk, you need to
make sure apic id is using 8 bits by check if the bit 16 (HTTC_APIC_ID) is set.
most BIOS already did that. You may ask Supermicro fix their broken
BIOS instead.
