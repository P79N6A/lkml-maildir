There is no need for the regularity.  When I use a word processor, I
use it very irregularly.  Sometimes I type text, and wants each letter
typed to appear instantly.  This fits well with "low cpu usage" and
sudden short bursts.  There may be lots of long delays though while
I think about stuff to write.  So the intervals are irregular, I still
believe I should get the boosts as long as the bursts are small.
Doing something big (such as invoking latex on a big document)
is cpu-heavy, but then it is ok not to get the boost.
Current schedulers based on io-waiting gets this right already.

Well, perhaps you could give a slightly bigge boost to a very regular
thing like xmms.  But even that might have some snags, the load
might change a lot when doing midi in software, depending on how
many instruments are active simultaneously. There goes the
constant-size bursts.
