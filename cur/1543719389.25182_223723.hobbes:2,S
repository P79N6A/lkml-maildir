This is all a matter of semantics and I have no argument with it.
I think your aims of simplifying the scheduler are admirable but I hope you 
don't suffer the quagmire that is manipulating the interactivity stuff. 
Changing one value and saying it has no apparent effect is almost certainly 
wrong; surely it was put there for a reason - or rather I put it there for a 
reason.
