It's parsing things with the wrong byte order. 
I gave a patch to the ksymoops maintainer and it was rejected --
"What if you want to decode little-endian oopses on a big-endian
machine?" -- and he had some plan to revamp oops generation so
that it was more common between the machines and didn't have these
problems.
In the mean time it doesn't work native.
