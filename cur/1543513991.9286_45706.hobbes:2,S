  Hi, all. I've just released version 1.2.4 of my devfsd (devfs
daemon) at: 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This works with devfs-patch-v112 (or later) and devfs-patch-v99.4 (or
later).
The main changes are:
- syslog(3) is not called until /dev/log is created by syslogd(8)
- device tree is scanned when daemon starts and synthetic REGISTER
  events are generated.
				Regards,
					Richard....
