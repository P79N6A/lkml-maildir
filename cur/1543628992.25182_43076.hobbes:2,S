Hi,
1. PIO ide is broken again, very quickly the driver stops with "hda: lost
interrupt". Martin could please also test PIO modes, before releasing a
new patch?
2. Why was ide_request_region removed? I see the changelog entry, but I
somehow doubt you contacted any of the affected architectures or even
really tested it. request_region will fail on most archs without ioports
and no "hack" will change that.
bye, Roman
