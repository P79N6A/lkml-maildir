I am running Volanomark in a loopback mode on a 2P woodcrest box 
(4 cores).  So the configuration is a bit different.  
In my testing, the CPU utilization is at 100%.  So
increase in ACKs will cost CPU to devote more
time to process those ACKs and reduce throughput.

As I'm running in loopback mode, there are no dropped packets.
Thanks.
