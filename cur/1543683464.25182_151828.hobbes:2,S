good.

no, i dont find it strange, as the -5..5 integer range is only the end
result. What we really want is an accurate sleep average, the integral of
sleep times done over the last N seconds. Given that tasks can schedule at
very high frequencies these days, this needs accurate measurements. I used
to hope that a 1 msec sampling frequency would to be enough for this, but
when we fix the statistics cornercase you mention, another cornercase pops
up. And it's not _that_ hard to use the cycle counter and still have a
reasonably fast algorithm, anyway.
