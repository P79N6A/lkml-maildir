Already there, modprobe -c.  You are looking at the wrong program.
depmod only builds the inter-module dependency list, modprobe reads the
options, load the modules and applies the options.

modutils is a generic tool.  It is up to each user of modutils to
specify the options required for their product.  There should be
working examples for sound, ppp, isdn, serial, pcmcia etc., but those
have to be written by the authors of each component.  This
documentation exists to some extent, search the linux/Documentation
subtree and all README files under linux/.
