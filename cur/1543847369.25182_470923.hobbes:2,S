Actually this ALIGN(4096) was already present present before symbol
__smp_alt_end that's why we kept it even when we moved __smp_alt_end
inside the section.
But now thinking about it, it looks like this ALIGN(4096) might not be
required. There is already one ALIGN(4086) present after this section
which should take care of protecting other data while this page is freed.
Please find attached a patch for the same. I am also copying Gerd Hoffmann,
who introduced this ALIGN. Gerd, can you please confirm that above ALIGN()
is not required and the patch attached should be fine.
As a side effect, above warning also disappears. Looks like there is no
data in the section .smp_altinstr_replacement but above ALIGN() forced
the linker to create a non-empty allocatable section. The type of the
section is NOBITS and probably that's why linker is emitting the warning.
I will write a separate mail to linker folks to find more about it.
Thanks
Vivek
o There seems to be one extra ALIGN(4096) before symbol __smp_alt_end. The
  only usage of __smp_alt_end is to mark the end of smp alternative
  sections so that this memory can be freed. As a physical page is freed
  one has to just make sure that there is no other data on the same page
  where __smp_alt_end is pointing. There is already a ALIGN(4096) after
  this section which should take care of the above issue. Hence it looks
  like the ALIGN(4096) before __smp_alt_end is redundant and not required.
