Then put "DEPRECATED" there, because you deprecate the enabling of the
option.
However, actual users of such a kernel option need the full explanation
of what's wrong with the option in order to decide whether to switch it
off.  The terse label alone is *insufficient*.   It's insufficient even
if you develop a scheme with two or more different labels for different
flavors of deprecation.  In fact, generically defined finer-grained
flavors of "deprecated" will be too fine-grained to be sensibly used in
/real/ feature removal processes.
It doesn't lead us anywhere to discuss about deprecation on an abstract
level.  Discuss concrete features (like the raw driver) with the people
who used that feature --- only then you get to know how to proceed with
that feature appropriately.
