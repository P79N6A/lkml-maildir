I assume with "slab external fragmentation" you mean allocating a
whole page for a slab when there are not enough objects to fill the
whole thing thus wasting memory? We could try to combat that by
packing multiple variable-sized slabs within a single page. Also,
adding some non-power-of-two kmalloc caches might help with internal
fragmentation.
In any case, SLUB needs some serious tuning for smaller machines
before we can get rid of SLOB.
