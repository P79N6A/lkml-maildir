Subject: Compaq Alpha: missing i-cache invalidates in ptrace (2.2.18, 2.4.0) ?

I've been seeing some peculiar effects on Alpha boxes (particularly on
SMPs) where threads run right past breakpoints planted by a debugger.
(This on 2.2 series kernels).
Looking at the code in arch/alpha/kernel/ptrace.c there appears to be
nowhere where flush_icache_range is called. According to the Alpha
architecture manual you must execute a "call_pal imb" (which is what
flush_icache_range turns into) after changing the I-stream.
So :-
1) Anyone agree with me that flush_icache_range ought to be called
   after any ptrace write which modifies an executable page ?
   (Or have I missed something which has this effect ?)
2) If so, would patches be accepted ?
The same problem also appears to exist in 2.4...
Thanks
