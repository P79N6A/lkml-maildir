What's quite interesting is that there is a very noticeable surge in 
load_balance with staircase in the early stage of the test, but there appears 
to be -no- direct policy changes to load-balance at all in Con's patch (or at 
least I didn't notice it -please tell me if you did!).  You can see it in 
busy load_balance, sched_balance_exec, and pull_task.  The runslice and 
latency stats confirm this -no-staircase does not balance early on, and the 
tasks suffer, waiting on a cpu already loaded up.  I do not have an 
explanation for this; perhaps it has something to do with eliminating expired 
queue.
I would be nice to have per cpu runqueue lengths logged to see how this plays 
out -do the cpus on staircase obtain a runqueue length close to 
nr_running()/nr_online_cpus sooner than no-staircase?
Also, one big change apparent to me, the elimination of TIMESLICE_GRANULARITY.  
Do you have cswitch data?  I would not be surprised if it's a lot higher on 
-no-staircase, and cache is thrashed a lot more.  This may be something you 
can pull out of the -no-staircase kernel quite easily.
