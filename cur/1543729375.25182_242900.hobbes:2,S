If all you want is the time try
clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, struct time_spec *tv)
Should work fine on 2.6.x kernels.  This is good to what ever the fine structure 
is on the box, e.g. TCP cycles on most x86 or pm_timer cycles on some, in any 
case it is good to better than a micro second.

   If you want a timer, look into the posix clocks & timers which were added at 
2.6.
