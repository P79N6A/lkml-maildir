Subject: [PATCH] Fix memory corruption in console selection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

[ I don't know who is the console maintainer or if there is any, so I'm 
posting this to Linus ]
Fix an off-by-two memory error in console selection.
The loop below goes from sel_start to sel_end (inclusive), so it writes 
one more character. This one more character was added to the allocated 
size (+1), but it was not multiplied by an UTF-8 multiplier.
This patch fixes a memory corruption when UTF-8 console is used and the 
user selects a few characters, all of them 3-byte in UTF-8 (for example a 
frame line).
When memory redzones are enabled, a redzone corruption is reported. When 
they are not enabled, trashing of random memory occurs.
