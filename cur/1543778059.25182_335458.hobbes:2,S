I am also using Debian sarge. I extracted the tarfile to /usr/local/bin
end executed "kmake menuconfig". Everything seemed fine so far. But a
few seconds after starting the compilation (kmake bzImage) I got this
error message:
In file included from <snip>
...
<snip>
include/asm/mpspec.h:6:25: mach_mpspec.h: No such file or directory
Hm. I understand why that file cannot be found: It only exists in the
asm-i386 directory. But why does the compilation process look for a file
that belongs to i386, but not to x86_64?
