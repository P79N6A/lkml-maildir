   Not unless it was added in after I submitted the patch that was
   finally accepted(tm);  The original patch didn't do any special
   handling of the e820 data, assuming (foolishly) that the Bios
   wouldn't lie too much.
   This turns out, like my trust in e801, not to be the case.  But,
   alas, it wasn't caught on my processor farm unlike e801 and the
   PA2103 motherboard :-(
