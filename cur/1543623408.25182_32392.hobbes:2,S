No, this is not true. As the gcc info pages says: 
   For example, if the target machine requires a `double' value to be
   aligned on an 8-byte boundary, then `__alignof__ (double)' is 8.  This
   is true on many RISC machines.  On more traditional machine designs,
   `__alignof__ (double)' is 4 or even 2.
A later example shows situations where alignof>sizeof.
