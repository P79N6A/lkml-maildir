Reading the documentation (ie. source code) it appears the problem is 
triggered by the line
WARN_ON(in_interrupt());
Looks like the driver calls pci_find_subsys() from inside an interrupt on 
occasions which apparently it shouldn't. The problem seems to be on 
nvidia's side, not kernel development. I have emailed nvidia about it some 
time ago, so far no reaction... 
I got the problem with nvidia modules 4496, 5328, 5336 and with kernels 
2.6.0, 2.6.1, 2.6.2, never with 2.4.X. I have stopped using the nvidia 
kernel module for now.

Is this www.nvnews.net you are talking about? I can't find any proper 
contacts on the nvidia web site. I'll go over and add a comment right 
now. ;-)
