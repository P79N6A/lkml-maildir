Stop argueing. You can shape only outgoing packets, which means that the
shaper must have a big uplink pipe and then shape that into a thin downlink
pipe. In Larrys' case, the shaper must be on the ISP network before the T1.
Once the packets hit the T1 (or your ISDN link), you've already
lost. No matter how much shaping, dropping, non-acking you're doing on
your side of the link.
