There actually haven't been that many attempts to "get this fixed". It's 
been more a) people complaining about it and nothing being done about 
the problems and b) adding hacks to blindly disable it because of 
reported problems without root-causing why those problems were showing 
up. With such approaches no wonder it has not been reliable to try  and 
use MMCONFIG in the past..
