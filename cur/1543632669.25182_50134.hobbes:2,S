Subject: How to get a gcc for RedHat 6.2 that will build the development kernel.

Recently, support for building with egcs was removed, IIRC.
I don't have enough disk space on my laptop to compile gcc 
and haven't located rpm files for a supported version
of gcc for RedHat 6.2.  Do any of you know where I might
locate such packages?  I have checked the ftp.redhat.com
and www.rpmfind.net sites.
I notice that RedHat 6.2 is listed as one of the test 
platforms for gcc 3.1, but no rpm packages are made available.
Thanks,
	Miles
