Subject: [PATCH] remove sb->s_files and file_list_lock usage in dquot.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/6/133

Iterate over sb->s_inodes instead of sb->s_files in add_dquot_ref.
This reduces list search and lock hold time aswell as getting rid of
one of the few uses of file_list_lock which Ingo identified as a
scalability problem.
Previously we called dq_op->initialize for every inode handing of
a writeable file that wasn't initialized before.  Now we're calling
it for every inode that has a non-zero i_writecount, aka a writeable
file descriptor refering to it.
Thanks a lot to Jan Kara for running this patch through his quota
test harness.
Note:  this is ontop of '[PATCH] move remove_dquot_ref to dqout.c'
which I sent out yesterday.
