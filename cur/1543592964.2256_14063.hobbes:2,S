Since I don't actually know what you're talking about, I'll just make picky
little comments about the grammar, etc. ;)

This is usually "say Y here." Minor, I know, but it'd be nice to get the
nomenclature standardized.
(Actually, "...to be selected in order to use some drivers, such as the DS1302
realtime clock driver, that access the I2C I/O pins directly instead of going
through the I2C driver." might scan better.)
