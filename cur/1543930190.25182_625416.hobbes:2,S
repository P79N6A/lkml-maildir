tests with 2.6.22 including CFS  show the same results.
This means the pressure on page cache is much higher when all processes 
run in parallel.
We see this behavior as well with iozone when writing on many disks with 
many threads and just 256 MB memory.
This means the scheduler schedules as it should - fair.
