Yes, we were starting to go around in circles weren't we?

I'd do scan through LKML from about 18 months ago looking for mention of 
runtime configurable version of plugsched.  Some students at a 
university (in Germany, I think) posted some patches adding this feature 
to plugsched around about then.
I never added them to plugsched proper as I knew (from previous 
experience when the company I worked for posted patches with similar 
functionality) that Linux would like this idea less than he did the 
current plugsched mechanism.
Unfortunately, my own cache of the relevant e-mails got overwritten 
during a Fedora Core upgrade (I've since moved /var onto a separate 
drive to avoid a repetition) or I would dig them out and send them to 
you.  I'd provided with copies of the company's patches to use as a 
guide to how to overcome the problems associated with changing 
schedulers on a running system (a few non trivial locking issues pop up).
Maybe if one of the students still reads LKML he will provide a pointer.
