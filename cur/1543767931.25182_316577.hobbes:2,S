Subject: Re: [PATCH] kfree cleanups (remove redundant NULL checks) in drivers/telephony/ (actually ixj.c only)

This patch adds behavioural changes:
-		if (j->read_buffer) {
-			kfree(j->read_buffer);
-			j->read_buffer = NULL;
-			j->read_buffer_size = 0;
-		}
+		j->read_buffer = NULL;
+		j->read_buffer_size = 0;
Now we'll zero ->read_buffer_size even if ->read_buffer was already NULL.
It's hard to believe that this could cause any problems, but please check
that.
