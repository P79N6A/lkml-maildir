It is very unlikely that you see "Coma" bug. It can be triggered only
by deliberately coded tight endless loop. "Ugly tokens on the screen"
suggest that you see something else.
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/changelog says:

               Remove Cyrix "coma bug" workaround from here.
               Moved to linux/arch/i386/kernel/setup.c and
               linux/include/asm-i386/bugs.h
but neither of those files mention "coma"...
PS: "coma" bug won't trigger if automatic locking of
xchg insn is disabled (yes, Cyrix can be configured to do this).
This shall be done for performance reasons too.
No SMP dangers since Cyrix CPUs aren't used in SMP...
So grep the source / google Inet for this if you are still interested.
