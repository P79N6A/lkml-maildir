Youch.  That card's actually breaking the PCI spec, but never mind, it exists.

In words, what the algorithm is doing is:
	for_each_rom_image
		get_the_pci_data_structure
		get_the_rom_length_from_pds
At the end of the algorithm, 'image' should be pointing to the end of the
ROM data.
I'm just tracking down another bug with the current code -- it maps the
ROMs into the wrong address range on my ia64 zx1 box.  I'll send more
mail once I've fixed that.

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
