As is, these sites are a bug in -rt and we'll need to fix them anyway.
As for the code you pointed me to, the i8042 driver, it seems to play
way to funny tricks for a simple 'slow' driver.
If you replace the spin_lock() + sync_sched(), with rcu_read_lock() +
rcu_call() it should work again without adding an extra lock.
