AFAICS, we can move d_add() right before taking the spinlock.  It's there
to protect the ->proc_dentry assignment.
*However*, I would like to point out that we are holding ->i_sem on the
procfs root at that point, so any blocking code in d_instantiate() would
better be careful to avoid deadlocks if it wants to play with procfs itself -
we are not in a locking-neutral situation here, spinlock or not.
