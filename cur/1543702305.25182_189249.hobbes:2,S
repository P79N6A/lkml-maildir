If it's so ugly, why do Solaris and Irix not have a problem in making a
device graph that looks somewhat like that as well?  The idea is *not*
so crazy as to discard out-of-hand.  Perhaps what you need is:
/dev/hda/disk  whole-disk access
/dev/hda/0     partition 0
/dev/hda/1     partition 1
... etc

You think that was ugly, you should have seen it around the F17 level when
there were still some bugs in there (you haven't lived till you see the ooglyness
of an 'rsh' between TCF cluster members of different flavors - it propagated
the environment variable that controlled that stuff.. :)
Incidentally, I'm told that HP/UX has a similar concept, at least in some
releases...
