That link just gives me a search page.  Got a better link?

Other uses include tons of embedded systems using Linux,
primarily those that handle any kind of A/V record/playback
(think "Tivo", MP3 player, video players, ...).
These are about as rare as a fileserver, when counting the installed base.
I think that the ATA streaming feature set cannot be done
efficiently (which is the whole point of it!) without some kernel support.
The device driver has to know about it, at a minimum so that it can
select a different EH protocol for the streams.  Which in turn means
that the streaming commands should be known to the driver as well.
But how to handle it all nicely is the real question.
A new block driver, if libata cannot handle it?
Cheers
