There is one thing though when a newie come's over say to Linux Kernel 
2.6/3.0 and is starting out using the new CML2 system he could acidentialy 
hit the wroung key and all the other option's for the other Linux Kernel 
port's will show up and he could click on one of the and try to make a kernel 
that is for a x86 and he could be clicking in the IA64 port menu on acident.
Do you see what I'm saying?
I have done it before and I downloaded CML2 2.0.3 and I did it again
