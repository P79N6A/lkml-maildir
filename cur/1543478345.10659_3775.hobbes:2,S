Hello,
there probably exists one more problem with NTFS.
I have run some script with a large find through the whole
tree, including mounted NTFS partitions. After some time
I found that the process blocks. I have explored
where it blocks and it was one specific directory,
not unusual in any way compared to other directories
on the fs (compressed, 8 levels, path length ca. 52,
35 files inside). Any operation that tried to list
the contents of the directory blocked the process
in the kernel - no kill -9, complaints during
reboot etc.
No messages were produced by the kernel at the time
of blocking (but I have probably overlooked an oops
which happened long before).
After the reboot the problem dismissed. I have run
the same script more times. One find failed (probably
with an oops described later). Next time the block
happened again, this time in another directory,
but relatively near the previous one.
echo 4095 > /proc/sys/fs/ntfs reports nothing
when doing the blocking 'ls', although there
are things reported in directories that do
function.
There were mysterious oopses in the find, which
probably indicate a problem, but I don't see what
sys_newlstat has to do with cleanup_module.
The 'ls' exhibits no such oops.

The environment is 2.2.0-pre6, NTFS as module, kmod, egcs 1.0.3.
This seems like an oops leaving some directory information
in locked state, but I am surely no expert in Linux filesystem
code. Do you have some more ideas what I could try
to further help in finding what happens here?
Regards
