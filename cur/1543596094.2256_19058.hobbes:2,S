For quite some time now I've wanted to try and do something in the kernel.  
And I need a simple project to start with, so I decided to create a 
filesystem that reads and writes to a XML file.  It's really basic right now 
(does not support permissions, but that should not be too hard to add) and 
does not like XML files with errors in them.
If any of you want to try it (and possibly lock your system in the process) 
you can download it from 
http://sethstoybox.org/projects/xmlfs/xmlfs.tgz.
  
I've had it compile under 2.4.2, 2.4.3, 2.4.5 on Debian and Mandrake systems.
I know it's kinda pointless (and really silly to put an XML parser in the 
kernel), but I had fun.  Comments (outside of "this is totally stupid") are 
greatly appreciated.
thanks
