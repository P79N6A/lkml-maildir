Replacing all bforget with brelse can't harm. It will only be far slower
as you'll risk to waste time flushing garbage to disk and you'll risk to
go into the shrink_mmap path to get some new buffer (while you are caching
buffers that are containing garbage). BTW, in 2.3.x you only need bforget
for the metadata as flushpage will take care of invalidating the dirty
page-cache and to kill their buffers during truncate_inode_pages.
