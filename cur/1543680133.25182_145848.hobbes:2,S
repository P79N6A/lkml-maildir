Subject: [RFC] [PATCH] LIRC drivers for 2.5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/7/120

The patch can be grabbed from
http://flameeyes.web.ctonet.it/patch-2.5.72-lirc.diff.bz2
This patch (that apply over .72+ but probably also in previous
versions), adds the LIRC drivers (
http://lirc.sf.net/
) from the cvs to
the kernel.
As userland tools can be used lirc (from cvs) build against a 2.4
kernel.
I've tested it with my tv card for some weeks and it works perfectly.
I hope can be useful.
[Sorry if this is a double message, my isp's mailserver has some problems, I receive an error back from it, but i'm not sure if it's true or a false warning. In case, sorry]
