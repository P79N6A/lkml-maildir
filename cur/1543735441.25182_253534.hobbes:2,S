Hi Marcelo,
there are a lot of sprintf() in gdth_get_info(). There are a few overflow
checks, but they're being done *after* the problem happens, so it may
be possible that people experiencing problems get some data overwritten
which prevents something else from been released later.
Moreover, when some of those checks decide that the buffer is full, they
jump to stop_output without calling gdth_ioctl_free(). So it may also be
possible that this user who regularly reads /proc has his output truncated
and some memory never freed.
Regards,
Willy
