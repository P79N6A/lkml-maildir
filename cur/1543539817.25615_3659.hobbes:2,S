Which one?  They all look well formed on my machine.

I think I can fix this.  I've added it to my to-do list.

Alas, I can't fix this yet.  I can't find the right tk method to give
me the fractional height of the corner of the visible region. which is
what I need to do a restorative scrolling operation when you pop back.
I've sent a query off to a Python-Tk expert I know.

That sounds like a low-level Tk error.  What version are you running?

Hm.  Sounds like a problem with the screen-motion optimizer inside 
ncurses.  Happens I wrote that code, years ago...I'll take a look at it.

Great.  Thanks for the excellent feedback!
