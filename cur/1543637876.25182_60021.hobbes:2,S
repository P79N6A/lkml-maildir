This is actually one of the same issues I was looking at this morning. 
I noticed that the Linux Test Project tests pread02 and pwrite02 were
failing because of this.  However I also had to do some typecasting to
make it work correctly.  I'm not sure this is the best way to do it, but
without the typecasting, the tests still fail.
