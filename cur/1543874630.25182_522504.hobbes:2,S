Are you sure there is no difference? Would this message
below be written? Would you waste youre time to write
the patch in this thread? Maybe even repostal of this
bug would be unnecessary - because somebody would have
seen in a minute something you analyzed at least 0,5h.
I don't say it's the best proposal - but at least:
1. we know the rules,
2. we save the diagnosing time for the real problem.
With  __kmem_cache_free you would set #1 I hope, but if
nobody would use this - debugging time wouldn't change.
This could be acceptable, if there were no problems
with fixing the errors. But there are problems - bugs
like this aren't fixed on time - maybe because people
waste too much time per bug?
If this path is so hot, there is other possibility:
- to write a comment about NULLs here,
- to require such checks were inserted earlier.
Why after this all there is no change in the bio_free?
This bio_free still is waiting to pass NULL bi_io_vecs
without any warning!
Why still no "nr_pages > 0" check in scsi_req_map_sg?
Was this patch so obvious - authors weren't so sure
(not talking about time)?
I think optimizations are good and possible: if there
is no bug in some place for 2 or 3 years - then OK.
But until there are such bugs - let from 1 driver only -
checks should definitely be added, even at a cost of
speed.
Cheers,
Jarek P.
