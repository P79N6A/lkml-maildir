Since we submit a whole cluster of (1 << page_cluster)
size at once, your change would mean that the VM can
only do one IO at a time...
Have you actually measured your changes or is it just
a gut feeling that the current default is too much?
(I can agree with 1/2 MB being a bit much, but doing
just one IO at a time is probably wrong too...)
The cleanup part of your patch is nice. I think that
one should be submitted as soon as the 2.4 bugfix
period is over ...
(and yes, I'm not submitting any of my own trivial
patches either unless they're REALLY needed, lets make
sure Linus has enough time to focus on the real bugfixes)
regards,
Rik
