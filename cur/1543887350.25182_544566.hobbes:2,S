But kprefetchd runs as SCHED_BATCH.  Doesn't that mean that some low-prio
background thing (seti?) will disable swap-prefetch?
I mean, if swap-prefetch is actually useful, then it'll still be useful if
the machine happens to be doing some computational work.  It's not obvious
to me that there is linkage between "doing CPU work" and "prefetching is
presently undesirable".
