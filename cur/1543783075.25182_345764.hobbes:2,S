Subject: MAX_ARG_PAGES has no effect?

The other day I was running a grep on a big directory tree and got a 
"Argument list too long" error.  Since I'd like to have this work 
without messing with find and xargs each time, I went into 
include/linux/binfmts.h and changed
#define MAX_ARG_PAGES 32
to
#define MAX_ARG_PAGES 64
I recompiled and installed the kernel, but there's no change (getconf 
ARG_MAX still gives 131072.)  What am I missing?
I am running 2.6.13 on amd64.
Thanks,
Nick Matteo
