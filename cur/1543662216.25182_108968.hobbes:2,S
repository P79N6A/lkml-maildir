[...] I have no real interest in vm86 mode, perhaps one of the people
interested in dosemu etc. could take care of it. I'm very glad it doesn't
exist on my main architecture - x86-64 - given how many hacks it needs to be 
supported.
I would like to have fast context switch on IA32 though so it would be nice 
if someone deeply familiar with sys_vm86 could review my patch.
Avoiding the SYSCALL_CS MSR is independent from the issues Linus raised.
