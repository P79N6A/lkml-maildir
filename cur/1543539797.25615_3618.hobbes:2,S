Well, then we have 2 issues here.  The "grand OS" issue, and the
"real world I don't want my system to fry" issue.  I fully stand
for the grand OS issue (or else I wouldn't be using Linux in the
first place), but I don't want my system to fry either.
I can't enforce that on anyone else though, but thanks to Linux
being GPL, I can always fix my own system how I see fit.  I
suppose the vendors can apply the patch on their own as well,
since they patch everything allready usually anyways.
