Yes, I'm booting in a runlevel without a session manager and starting
my X session with xinit.
(slackware: console->runlevel 3; sessionmanager->runlevel 4 )

No, since I'm using capabilities and I'm very happy with it, I grant
cap_kill to xinit. For myself the problem is solved ...

... but if some user decides to configure capabilities into the 2.6.24
kernel or just uses such a kernel and
1) is not granting cap_kill to xinit, and
2) starts X by issuing xinit on the console
3) ends after some time his X session, to come back to the console
he will see a different behavior compared to 2.6.23 exiting his X
session and (I think) believes to have a bug in the X package.
Andrew Morton describes the problem here, too:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/23/15
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/23/19
Am I wrong in the assumption, but should one not accept an unchanged
behavior with or without capabilities in the kernel regarding the
behavior of applications, when he is not actually using (by not setting
the xattr capability) capabilities with this application?
If I'm wrong, maybe a warning or hint should be given that one has to
grant cap_kill to xinit to come back to the console if the X session
was started by xinit.
