Hello!
I wrote an init replacement (cinit), which is now in the beta-phase.
The only problem I do have currently is that when calling
'loadkeys dvorak' directly from init (without a shell or anything)
it will leave behind a gzip zombie (which was forked by loadkeys).
Now my question is: Is that a problem of loadkeys or from my init
and what could be the reasons that it's still there?
cinit forks() loadkeys and does waitpid() for it. There is no
loadkeys zombie, only gzip.
Thanks for any input,
Nico
P.S.: Replying to me directly will result in a confirmation mail,
      I'll read lkml directly anyhow.
