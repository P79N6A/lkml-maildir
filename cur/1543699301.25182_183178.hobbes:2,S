Andre - before you get involved in a flame war, take a deep breath. You
know you get too excited about things.
Go back and read what I said. I said _nothing_ like the above. Quite the
reverse.
Also, I don't see what the "API" discussion is. That's a _total_ red
herring. There is no "module API", and never has been. Modules have always
been about linking against internal kernel functions, and it's always been
very clear that there is no API, and that those internal kernel interfaces
change _all_ the time.
