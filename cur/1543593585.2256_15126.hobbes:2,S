Hmm.  Unless I am mistaken the complexity is O(SwapPages*VMSize)
Which is very bad, but no where near exponentially horrible.

Definitely.  I played following the page tables in a good way a while
back, and even when you do it right the process is slow.  Is 
if (need_resched) {
        schedule();
}
A good idiom to use when you know you have a loop that will take a
long time.  Because even if we do this right we should do our best to
avoid starving other processes in the system 
Hmm.  There is a nasty case with turning the walk inside out.  When we
read a page into RAM there could still be other users of that page
that still refer to the swap entry.  So we cannot immediately remove
the page from the swap cache.  Unless we want to break sharing and
increase the demands upon the virtual memory when we are shrinking
it...

I'm trying to remember the advantages.  Besides not having to care
that a page is a swap page in free_pte.  If there really is some value
in not handling the pages there (and I seem to recall something about
pages under I/O).  It might at least be worth putting the pages on
their own LRU list.  So that kswapd can cruch through the list
whenever it wakes up and gives a bunch of free pages.
