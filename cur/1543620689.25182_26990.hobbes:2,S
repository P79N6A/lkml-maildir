I have GRUB installed with RH 7.2.  I build and test 
the development kernel series.  How can I get "make install"
to work with GRUB?  It seems like maybe we need a "install-grub"
target or we need to have a way to automatically determine the
bootloader being used and then do corresponding install method.
