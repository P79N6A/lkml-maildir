Yes.
But if user has sh, cat and single writable location,
he can just type in any ELF executable, provided (s)he
is clever/mad enough.
That is the exact reason why I abolished [/usr]/sbin

into corresponding bin/ and chmod'ed a+rx.
I keep symlinks (sbin -> bin) just in case some silly
script expects them to exist.
