  Partition Surprise could handle the conversions in userspace but not
in-kernel ones (which I think are discussed above)... We had only set
of patches for online ext2 resizing and that was already non-trivial
(especially shifting block descriptors and such). Conversion could be
actually done in a similar way in principle - one could establish some
block remapper which would map metadata of new filesystem into free
space of the other one and could be moving files by deleting it from
one filesystem and creating them in the other one... But it would not
volunteer to write that (it would be really hard to do it atomicly and
almost impossible to not make garbage of your data when power fails..)
