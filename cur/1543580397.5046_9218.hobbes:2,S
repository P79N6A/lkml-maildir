Make sure you compile wireless-tools using the right headers.  You must
manually insert -I/path/to/running-linux-version/include in the Makefile.
This is due to a bad (non-existing) ioctl backward and forward
compatibility, and is being worked on.  Basically, you cannot use the
tools compiled with one version of the wireless extension headers on a
kernel with another version of the wireless extensions.  The symptom is at
best a SEGV, but you may also get strange values.
