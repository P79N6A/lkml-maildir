In less than 6 hours since I turned on the machine I have been getting
these message (spread over different times) in my dmesg:
Machine A (AMD Athlon 4200, 3G RAM):

b.   Seemingly repeatable ..... how to generate a BUG() stack trace at
the point of error - recompiling really needed?
c.   Kernel version 2.6.28-rc6, with FTRACE compiled option turned on.
