He's referring to EMU DSP manager.  (emudspmgr I think it's called).
The ALSA equivalent is ld10k1.  It might not be as mature as the OSS
equivalent, but are we really going to keep obsolete drivers in the
kernel just because the userspace tools for the old driver are more
mature?

I guess he's referring to the well known "Master volume only controls
front output" problem.  This really does need to be resolved, as many
other ALSA drivers are effected.
