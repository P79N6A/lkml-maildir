A. Where can I get wireless-dev, please?
B. Against what kernel can I apply it?
C. How must this stuff be applied?
Three clear questions, three clear answers please, if we want get forward.
Apart from that I do not owe a wireless device, and i more and more get the 
impression that you simply do not want to rework your code.
You rather search hungrily for excuses to point to some voluntary other side 
as soon as your code does not seem to work as expected and as soon as 
responsibilty issues are concerned.
So what tester would enjoy such a stubborn behaviour?
And additionally: Without getting paid for all the time effort?

I think you can easily compare your wireless-dev code (where can I download 
it?) with the patch in the mm-tree. A simple diff will do I suppose.

As I stated already, debugging is not impossible!
In fact your responses didn't even mention real debugging as a choice.
To debug the issue I need the debug command line parametres for both ssb and 
b44. I cannot guess them, as there is no documentation available, neither for 
b44 nor for ssb. So what are the debug parametres please?

It is not my primary goal to leave you alone with this......

No, we need simply friendlier code developers without that immense arrogance 
behaviour that you show. That's it.

Yes. And I am doing this in my spare time too. And what I do not like is 
simply guessing around (ACPI bug, typo errors at DNS and nonsense like that 
etc.) plus this gesture going: "You are dumb, you are not understanding 
anything etc."
Cheers and happy reflection
Uwe
P. S.: My door is open, although the whole issue starts to nerve me due to 
your behaviour.
