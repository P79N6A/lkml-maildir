Mauro,
First of all, Manu is not a machine shitting out solutions on other one's pressure.
And he is doing right so far, as far as what happened.
Second: You should do some self-reflection on the damage you did on the human layer.
You appear like not even having any intention or idea on how to do that, you just behave technocratic and cold, you are just doing "I-AM-THE-BOSS, AND-NOTHING-GOES-WITHOUT-ME"-politics, that's all. 
Even if you do not have at least partially any idea about it all, you just try to rule "godlike", you know. Not everybody agrees with that ruling style, just a hint for you that you do not ever want to see, because you prefer to be blind in order to rule, to move on to the daily dayplan, as if nothing happened. But there happened many things. But you just prefer to be blind.
Currently me and Manu are working on a long lasting project very harmonizing, which I never believed to be possible at all, but we do work together :-).
And as long as the the ruler behaviour and the ruling structure of linuxtv.org keeps on behaving like this (including all the nasty people like mrechberger for instance), then let me tell you that I care a shit about what is being pulled into the kernel and what is not, man!
Now if you cannot take that I feel sorry, but he whole system around here gotta be changed as far as maintainership is concerned.
You cannot go on like this, Mr. Chehab, and even if you keep on ignoring this message you will be producing nothing but damage in the end.
Noone was born to act and behave like a nodding nigger in front of you - and if you do not want to take that, well, then you're strictly obsolete, man!
Without any politeness
Uwe
