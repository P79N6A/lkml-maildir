Shall e-mail you rightway, thanks.
OffTopic: pic was 145KB, any good tool to compress with ease without
much loss of quality on linux? Tried some, couldn't crop images
easily!

Yep, till September 2006 I was active with Kernel building with
another group in my Labs. I think I have built 2.6.18 sucessfully for
my IBM ThinkCentre A51 Workstation (Non HT) that time. Should I post
that .config here?
Now I have resumed Kernel building activities after a gap....all hell
broke loose for me....problems are cropping up with this P4-HT
machine!
I have compared my present .config with the distro's updated 2.6.18
kernel config, made changes. No differences. But I really wonder
what's wrong with my 2.6.19/2.6.20-rc4 building efforts :( I still
have one my Dual Core Laptop in the que, god knows...
