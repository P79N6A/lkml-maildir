as far as I've understood Herbert's patch, at least TCP connect can be fixed 
so that non blocking connect() will neither fail nor block, but just use the 
first or second retransmission of the SYN packet to complete the handshake 
after IPSEC is up. As this will fix the common breakage case, just do so and 
keep UDP sendmsg() etc for later.
You are looking at this issue too much from the kernel side. Admitted, this is 
a corner case, but therefore nobody cares if connection completion takes two 
SYNs and three seconds instead of one SYN and may be two seconds. But 
application developers and users will validly complain if their applications 
block unexpectedly for hours just because some random provider has a network 
outage and IPSEC cannot come up.
