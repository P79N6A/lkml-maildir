You might want to take a look at the onboard video market.  Providing an 
open-source 2D rendering engine and the PCI glue logic that work on an 
FPGA would probably revolutionize embedded PC applicatiuons that rely on 
a graphical interface.  Providing support to motherboard manufaturers 
who might want a low-cost onboard video solution (micro-ITX, etc) is 
another possibility.
You also might want to look at PC/104 and CompactPCI form factors - I 
think the industrial market will be a great target, and, after all, if 
you have to move 80% industrial equipment to justify the 20% AGP sales, 
it makes good sense.  There might even be a market for ISA, SBus, and 
MCA cards, for people stuck supporting seriously old machines (386, 486, 
SPARC) where it's almost impossible to find working graphics cards. 
Even if it's a DOS machine, hardware is hardware, and a brand-new VL-bus 
card for someone's 486 would be pretty cool :)
