Then trigger this action when a program exits and when you know there was 
enough freed up to justify such an action. However, this is still a 
heuristic. No one knows if the pages read from swap will be of any use at 
all. For all I know a process may want to allocate some memory and fail 
because the memory was needlessly spend to read in pages that no one 
needs.
