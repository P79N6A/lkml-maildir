Each iommu has multiple domains, where each domain represents an 
address space. PCIexpress endpoints can be located on its own domain
for addr protection reasons, and also have its own tag for iotlb cache.
each addr space can be either a 3 or 4 level. So it would be hard to predict
how much to setup ahead of time for each domain/device.
Its not a simple single level table with a small window like the gart case.
Just keeping a pool of page sized pages its easy to respond and use where its
really necessary without having to lock pages down without knowing real demand.
The addr space is plenty, so growing on demand is the best use of memory 
available.
