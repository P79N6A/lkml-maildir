Where did that GPLv1.1 nonsense come from?
There is no GPLv1.1 code in the tree. By the time I selected the GPL for 
the kernel license, the GPLv1.1 had long since been discontinued. The 
kernel was *never* GPLv1.1-only compatible. That's just total nonsense.
There was indeed a kernel license before the GPLv2, but it wasn't the GPL 
at all, it was my own made-up thing. Appended here, for those who are too 
lazy to actually look up and check the original Linux-0.01 announcement.

This kernel is (C) 1991 Linus Torvalds, but all or part of it may be
redistributed provided you do the following:
	- Full source must be available (and free), if not with the
	  distribution then at least on asking for it.
	- Copyright notices must be intact. (In fact, if you distribute
	  only parts of it you may have to add copyrights, as there aren't
	  (C)'s in all files.) Small partial excerpts may be copied
	  without bothering with copyrights.
	- You may not distibute this for a fee, not even "handling"
	  costs.
