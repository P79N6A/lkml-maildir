Really? An UltraSparc is a PC?

bash compiles on numerous systems other than Linux, from DG/UX to AIX to
Cray to WinNT (with Mumit Khan's cygwin system).
readline is even more portable.
It would be a very bad idea to assume that GNU == Linux == PC when
changing GNU utilities; GNU stuff works on a superset of Linux runs on a
superset of PC.
obArgh: The idiots at work are dumping Netware for NT. This despite NT
not doing many things we rely on Netware doing (quotas foremost). Why?
Marketing :(
