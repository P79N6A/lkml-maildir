However, these allocations are not of the "easy to reclaim" type, in
which case they just use the regular fragmented-to-shit areas. If no
contiguous pages are available from there, then an easy-reclaim area
needs to be stolen, right?
In which case I don't see why these patches don't have similar long
term failure cases if there is strong demand for higher order
allocations. Prolong things a bit, perhaps, but...

Regardless, I think we need to continue our steady move away from
higher order allocation requirements.
