I can only speak for 2.4-Kernel
I burn DVDs since more than 2 years now. Starting with 2.4.4 and i had
NEVER problems with the size, i never used the split-option of mkisofs
(and i don't even know the correct(tm) name of it. I only know that it
exists).
The maximum is 4489MB, (>4.700.000.000 bytes) and the biggest images i
had are only a few KB smaller that that.
Since about 2 month i use reiserfs on the "source" and on the
"target"-HDD. No changes, except that reiserfs is slower then ext2.
