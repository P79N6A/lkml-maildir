Subject: [patch 2/2] [PATCH] br: fix race on bridge del if
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Stephen Hemminger <shemminger@osdl.org>
This fixes the RCU race on bridge delete interface.  Basically,
the network device has to be detached from the bridge in the first
step (pre-RCU), rather than later. At that point, no more bridge traffic
will come in, and the other code will not think that network device
is part of a bridge.
This should also fix the XEN test problems. If there is another
2.6.13-stable, add it as well.
