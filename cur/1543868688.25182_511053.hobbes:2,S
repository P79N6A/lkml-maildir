No that is not the case:
@@ -875,6 +878,11 @@ force_reclaim_mapped:
 		pagevec_strip(&pvec);
 		spin_lock_irq(&zone->lru_lock);
 	}

So you do the swap free on the pages leftover from moving to the inactive 
list and not to the pages that will be moved to the active list. It does 
not do what you wanted to be done.
You need to
1. Do the pagevec_swap_free in the loop over the active pages
2. At end of the loop over the active pages do something like the above.
