Well, after a kernel crash, you'll "only" have to wait for fsck to finish.
But it is no fun at all to come up in 2055 (or so) because hwclock's
fallback method (which is to access the ISA bus, I think) fails (no RTC..).
After this, "make" will fail, accounting systems report very strange times
and so on... That's really not nice;( I think for these reasons, the
RTC drivers should be fixed. Some architectures use different RTCs. In this
case, I think that a module is the best solution since you can supply some
options;) But unfortunately module support (at least for Alpha?) seems
to be falling off the desk right now;(
