Hi,
Trying to compile the current kernel (test10-pre4) with:
> make clean
> make -j 2 bzImages modules modules_install 
will try to install the modules before they are built...
This has previously been working (at least in early testX kernels).
make --version
  GNU Make version 3.79.1, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.
