Ah. That's because you're using [u]swsusp. If you used Suspend2, your
git trees would be in the cache, your system wouldn't be slow and you'd
still be back up in that half a minute or so - probably less time. Give
it a try for a week, and then go back to rebooting. After that, tell me
rebooting is better and I've wasted the last 5 or 6 years improving the
code.
