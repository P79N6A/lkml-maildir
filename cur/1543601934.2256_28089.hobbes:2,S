I have tried it both ways, but I think only with 2.4.2.  I've only tried
one 2.4.9 build, and that was with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82CXXX=y.  I've
just done another build with slightly different config settings
(suggestion from Mark Hahn), but haven't tried it yet.  It still has
both the VIA and Promise (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX=y) support enabled.
I'll report back when I've tried this kernel build.
