What do you have in mind?  Still using slabs for kmalloc, but adding
non-power-of-two-sizes?  Adding buckets of size (2^n)*1.5 would be
straightforward, and should get most of the benefit, if there is
benefit to be had.

Yes, this would be help the cases which use kmalloc because they don't
allocate enough objects to make use of a slab cache worthwhile (other
remaining cases of kmalloc with constant size should be converted to
use their own slab caches, no?).  But since those cases are not doing
a lot of allocations, the overall benefit might not be that great.
My "hack" should help with things like the kmalloc done by alloc_skb
(though a slab cache of 1500 byte buffers might be even better for the
high performance network drivers; (2^n)*1.5 byte buckets should also
work well for this case).
