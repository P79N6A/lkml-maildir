Hi,
I am not sure that my problem is because of the Kernel but I want to
ask to you.
I have a 40 GB HDD Maxtor DiamondMax.
I can reach this HDD with a special software (EZ-Disk) which is
installed into boot sector. 
After this program strats Lilo comes and my RedHat 6.1 system starts.
I can see my disk partition (10 Gb & 30 Gb) disk as /dev/hda1 and
/dev/hda2 on Linuxconf.
But when I  want to mount this partiton I got error msg.
Are there anybody who can success define  such a big HDD into RedHat. ?
Thanks,
Oguz
