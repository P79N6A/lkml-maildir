I am not sure... that BTN_TOUCH - look slike it works off a single
flag reported by hardware. You porobably do not need to change it.
Try loading mousedev module (after adding input_sync back to your
driver) - it provides cooked PS/2 protocol to userspace - it should
bind to your driver. Then you can use GPM or X (read from
/dev/input/mice) to test the touchscreen and see if you have issue
with double clicks.
