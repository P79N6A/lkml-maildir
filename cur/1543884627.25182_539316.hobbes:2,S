Serial drivers?  Well you saw me drop a bunch of them.  I now have:
serial-driver-pmc-msp71xx.patch
rm9000-serial-driver.patch
serial-define-fixed_port-flag-for-serial_core.patch
mpsc-serial-driver-tx-locking.patch
serial-serial_core-use-pr_debug.patch
I'll also be holding off on MADV_FREE - Nick has some performance things to
share and I'm assuming they're not as good as he'd like.
