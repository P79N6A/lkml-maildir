Hi,
It's quite possible that I misunderstand your question,
but anyway:
Alt-Sysrq-<key> is a route into the kernel sysrq handler instead
of a route into the shell that the serial console is connected to,
so something needs to signal that condition (like a BREAK).
Or a specialized (serial) console app could know other ways of
recognizing sysrq keys.  Or you could use /proc/sysrq-trigger:
	echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger
