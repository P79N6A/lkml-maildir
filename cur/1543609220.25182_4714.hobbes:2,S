You don't have job control on /dev/console because it will never
become a controlling tty automatically. But if you make it your
controlling tty with the right ioctl() you'll have job control.
In fact the latest sysvinit does this for process spawned from
the 'sysinit', 'bootwait' and 'wait' type lines in /etc/inittab
and that works fine.

That would be extremely c00l ;)
