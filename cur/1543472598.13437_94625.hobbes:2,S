The cost of I/O is in seek time and not in disk read/througput
time. Compression will only reduce the already cheap part but
does nothing about the expensive seek times...
If you want cheaper swap I/O, use proper I/O clustering and
readahead. There is some (rather primitive) code for this in
the kernel and it is due for a revamp for 2.3...
