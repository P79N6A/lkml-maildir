 Ignoring the fact that most people don't use a tty based desktop, and
that I'm pretty happy having my desktop die in flames when OOM (my DNS
or smtp server on the other hand...).

 I fail to see why, stack usage can be limited (and possibly cleanly
handled by having a prctl() to say make sure X pages are available on
the stack).
 If you want overcommit great, and I think it's a valid default
... but it'd be nice if I could say I don't want it for apps that
aren't written using glib etc.
