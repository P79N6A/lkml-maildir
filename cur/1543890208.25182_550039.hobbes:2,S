Figuring out how a userspace/kernelspace interface works should not  
rely on having to read kernelspace code. Unfortunately, in the case  
of hotplug / uevents, there is no such documentation. Thus, what  
kernelspace / userspace interactions actually are and what they  
should be is unclear, leading to confusion over corner cases, such as  
this one.
