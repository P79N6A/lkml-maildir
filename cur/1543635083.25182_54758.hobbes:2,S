I'll try that.   Though I'm running bios v1.11 on the TP560, not v1.20
(which apparently requires CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS to be set).
For now, I've found that to get hibernate/suspend working again, I
don't even need to have a floppy drive attached or even use
mount/umount.  All I have to do is:
% modprobe -r floppy
% modprobe floppy
then I can suspend or hibernate with no problem.
