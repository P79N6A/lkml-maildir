depending on what type of timeout you are using you'll also need to chrt 
the softirq-timer kernel thread(s) to prio 99. Otherwise the timer fn 
will have no chance to be executed. There's work going on by Thomas to 
make such things automatic, by prioritizing timers. If you have HRT 
enabled in the .config then it should mostly be automatic already 
though.
