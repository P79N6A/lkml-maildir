Simple solution is to have kernel fall-back to LBA style
translations instead of kernel "basic" translations.
This would make it match the first two "BIOS" drives
on most systems, and not really hurt anything in most cases.
Even better would be to add a stage in front of the fall-back,
which queries the BIOS (from kernel startup code) for translation
info on ALL drives.
