i goess throug 2.2.10ac10 to current 2.2.10ac12 and my batch picture
convertor (as mentioned in my other posts) still leads to system crash.
latest message (when running job from my local CD-ROM copying files to NFS
filesystem and converting them there):

X windows crashed, system works but i rebooted it while earlier it 
completely locks up machine after aditional time.
whe shuting down, file-systems were not unmounted properly because they
were busy.
