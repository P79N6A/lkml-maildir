Just for the fun (?) of it, I made a grep/visual inspection for all
occurences of suser/fsuser, and found the following:
./fs/ufs/balloc.c -- 1 occurence of fsuser
./include/linux/sched.h -- def. of suser/fsuser
./include/linux/compatmac.h -- compability-macro for suser
./drivers/net/wan/lmc/lmc_main.c -- 7 occurences of suser
./drivers/net/pcmcia/xircom_tulip_cb.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/block/cciss.c -- 2 occurences of suser
./drivers/block/cpqarray.c -- 3 occurences of suser
./drivers/block/swim3.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/block/swim_iop.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/char/console.c -- 2 occurences of suser
./drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c -- 4 occurences of suser
./drivers/char/tty_io.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/char/lp.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/char/vt.c -- 4 occurences of suser
./drivers/char/esp.c -- 1 occurences of suser
./drivers/char/tpqic02.c -- 2 occurences of suser
./drivers/char/rocket.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/char/sx.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/char/dz.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/char/isicom.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/char/mxser.c -- 2 occurence of suser
./drivers/char/serial167.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/char/ip2main.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/char/rio/rio_linux.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/char/moxa.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/scsi/cpqfcTSinit.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/sbus/char/vfc_dev.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/sbus/char/aurora.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/tc/zs.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/pcmcia/ds.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./drivers/s390/block/mdisk.c -- 2 occurences of suser
./drivers/media/video/zr36120.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./arch/i386/kernel/mtrr.c --  9 occurences of suser
./arch/sparc/kernel/pcic.c -- 2 occurences of suser
./arch/m68k/bvme6000/rtc.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./arch/m68k/mvme16x/rtc.c -- 1 occurence of suser
./arch/sparc64/kernel/ioctl32.c -- 1 occurence of suser
Anyone who recognises his/her area of responsibility here or feels
guilty about it anyway, should have a look to see what capability is
best to replace it with.
A goal that isn't too unrealistic IMHO is to have all calls to suser/fsuser
and the calls themselves removed by v2.4.5 or so.
