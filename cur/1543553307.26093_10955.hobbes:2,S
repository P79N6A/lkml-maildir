 This is the legacy 8254 timer source, used for the system time, i.e. 
gettimeofday() and friends.

 This is the NMI watchdog at work.  Every tick of the legacy timer all
CPUs receive an NMI unless overridden by the "nmi_watchdog" command line
argument.

 This is the internal local APIC timer used for scheduling.  Every CPU is
equipped with such a private timer.
