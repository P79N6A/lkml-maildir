But that _wasn't_ in this idiotic thread.
The subject line of my announcement was
	Subject: Linux 2.6.9-rc4 - pls test (and no more patches)
and the body was
	Ok, 
	 trying to make ready for the real 2.6.9 in a week or so, so please give
	this a beating, and if you have pending patches, please hold on to them
	for a bit longer, until after the 2.6.9 release. It would be good to have
	a 2.6.9 that doesn't need a dot-release immediately ;)
	The appended shortlog gives a pretty good idea of what has been going on. 
	Mostly small stuff, with some architecture updates and an ACPI update 
	thrown in for good measure.
(plus the shortlog).
Not exactly "hidden", was it?
And to everybody complaining about "-rcX" - people don't want to break 
existing scripts, so the naming possibilities are either "-pre" or "-rc". 
And we've used "-rc" for the whole 2.6.x series, so there had better be a 
_good_ reason to change the naming.
So far, nobody has had a good reason. People are just complaining, because 
this is an area where you can complain without actually having any real 
hard technical input. It's "easy" to have an opinion.
So guys, look at the big picture. Is this really worth worrying over?
