Hi
Thanks for the netdev Cc, I didn't know where to write to the "network 
guys".
By the way thanks for replying. It's hard to explain and describe a 
problem when you know people will ask you hundreds of questions related 
to application-level problems, or not reply because web/mysql problems 
are so common and generally not related to any kernel issue.

I used to use TCP offloading one time, and by the way never had a 
problem with it. Besides just to be sure, I have been able to reproduce 
the problem without any offload engine enabled (= not compiled into the 
kernel, mainly because it seems to hang the kernel at boot in 2.6.24.3). 
So I assume that is not the problem
I use wireshark to analyse my pcap files and it says the checksum is 
correct on all packets.

I have the conntrack  on both the client and server, and unfortunately 
can't disable it now on the client (I use it only for the REDIRECT 
target on a precise destination address and port, not MySQL related), 
however I will test today and disable it on the server, after I get some 
sleep (although I think the issue is on the client).
