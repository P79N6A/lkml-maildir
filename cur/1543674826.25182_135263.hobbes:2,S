Ditto the Inspiron 8500 - no apic at all (which is different from
known-broken, since nothing bad happened.)  
For cleanliness sake it would be nice to have specific model info in the
blacklist ("your hardware doesn't have a frobber" is nicer than "the
frobber on your hardware causes your pets to catch fire"), but since the
hardware doesn't exist anyway the end result is the same. (And the code
is a lot more readable.)
Perhaps just a comment above those entries:
/* Latitude C840 and Inspiron 8500 have no APIC support in hardware */
Eventually it might even turn into a proper whitelist/blacklist
collection.
