If you allow CUSTOM_CFLAGS and friends (as an open-ended set of flags for
the compiler) then yes, having config options like CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
is redundant and should be removed.
Alternately, don't have a CUSTOM_CFLAGS and expand on the set of config
options which set individual compiler flags.  They could be in their
own menu, a bunch of checkboxes to tweak GCC's various optimisation
algorithms and/or warnings. That's certainly going to be friendlier
for the not-very-experienced kernel builder, if less flexible than
CUSTOM_CFLAGS.

I think that's a very interesting idea. Yes, you can test the flags by
compiling and linking a simple program. If it fails, your flags are
bad. You can stop the build right there and say "fix your flags".
The build could also capture the GCC warning/error output and
post-process it. Certain types of warnings might be suppressed,
or cause the build to fail (based on selected config options). My
kernel builds always show a handful of "may be used uninitialised" or
similar ... I just assume that those warnings are harmless. It is best
of course that these warnings don't occur at all, and I expect kernel
developers to fix them when they get a chance.  The idea in this
paragraph would be desirable to me, independent of how the CFLAGS are
specified.

No, I think I understood correctly. If you tell the user to go to that
long URL then you run the risk of pointing to the documentation for a
different version of GCC. On the other hand, if you tell them to type
"info gcc" then they will see the documentation for the version of GCC
which they have installed. And it's also a lot friendlier to write:
"Type 'info gcc' to see a full list of the compiler options".

I'm looking to find a balance among the competing objectives. Time
will tell with any improvements. I'm also hoping for an aesthetically
pleasing config menu -- perhaps someone else can take on the challenge of
restructuring it to improve the ordering, structure and names of options.

No prob.
