stringifying?
The whole point of the original change was to not do any string
concatenation of __FUNCTION__, but it is a string already.
However, could you try this change instead:
-# define PARANOIA(f, a...) printk(KERN_NOTICE "%s: " f, __FUNCTION__, ## a)
+# define PARANOIA(f, a...) printk(KERN_NOTICE "%s: " f, __FUNCTION__ , ## a)
Apparently an extra space before the comma before ## is supposed to
matter. Several of the macros I pointed at before already do that.
