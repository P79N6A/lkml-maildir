I too like this suggestion.  The current duplication of cpus_allowed and
mems_allowed between task and cpuset is a fragile design, forced on us
by incremental feature addition and the need to maintain backwards
compatibility.

Do you mean kernel or application compile time?  The current affinity
mechanisms have enough field penetration that the kernel will have to
support or emulate these calls for a long period of deprecation at best.
So I guess you mean application compile time.  However, the current user
level support, in glibc and other libraries, for these calls is
sufficiently confused, at least in my view, that rather than have that
same API mean two things, depending on a compile time switch, I'd rather
explore (1) emulating the existing calls, just as they are, (2) adding
new calls that are try these API's again, in line with our kernel
changes, and (3) eventually deprecate and remove the old calls, over a
multi-year period.
