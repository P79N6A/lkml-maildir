That is unfortunate.  I view CPUSET is a "first class" option that
happens to be built on CONTAINERS.  IMO, I shouldn't have to know this
implementation detail in order to select CPUSET--indeed, even to be
offered the optio--in 'make *config'.  However, it will be hidden if I
haven't already selected containers.  Or do I misunderstand the
implications of "depends on"?
Andrew:  is the problem with select something fatal or just too
difficult to fix?
