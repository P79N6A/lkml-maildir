I wasn't going to be too picky here, but if you volunteer
to make things even better, I'll be happy!  :)

If you're willing to fix all the in-tree users, I'd think
not needing MODULE_ALIAS is best in the long term.
For these I2C drivers, the conversion to support "new style"
driver binding is new in 2.6.23, yes?  If so, I don't see any
real downside to making the driver and module names match.
