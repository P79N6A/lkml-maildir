If you could help that would be great. You needn't do anything
other than test. The patch sort of enables run cloned thread
last which allows us to remove balance on clone, which is important.

The patch I just sent (which is on top of -mm6) should hopefully
work... if you feel like testing a solution that may still get
vetoed by Ingo.
Also, what compile errors are you getting? i386 seems to compile
kernel/ fine with only the first sched- patch applied.
