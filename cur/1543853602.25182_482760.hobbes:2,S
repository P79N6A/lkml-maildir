Andi, your "blame game" doesn't matter.
The fact is, it used to work, and the kernel changed interfaces, so now it 
doesn't. 
In other words, a kernel interface to user land changed. THAT IS ALWAYS A 
BUG. We don't change UI.
Yes, "oprofile" should be fixed to not depend on that, but the kernel 
shouldn't change the interfaces, and we should add back the zero entry.
