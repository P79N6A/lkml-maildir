The reason people post their patches for review is to get good feedback
on them. The problems you list above are mostly nitpicks. They must be
fixed before inclusion of the patch, but only make sense to start fixing
once the patch does a reasonable change.
Often patches have deeper problems (like "this won't ever work", "there
is a nice race hidden in there", "why do we need this part at all"), and
spotting those is much more valuable for both the sumbitter and the
progress of development.
Obviously, it's much harder to do that than to comment on a misplaced
brace.
It's an utter waste of effort to force a first time patch author to fix
all the style issues in his patch, just to see it rejected by the
maintainer because it is fundamentally wrong later.
Just something to consider.
