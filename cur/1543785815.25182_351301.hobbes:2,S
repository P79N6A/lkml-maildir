I understood that fact - but I fail to see the point. If you mean to
imply "people did not use ISO-2022, therefore, they will never use
encoding declarations", I think this implication is false. People
do use encoding declarations.
If you mean to imply "people did not use ISO-2022, therefore, they
will never use the UTF-8 signature", I think this implications is
also false. People do use the UTF-8 signature, even outside Japan.
The primary reason is that the UTF-8 signature is much easier to
implement than ISO-2022: if you support UTF-8 in your tool (say,
a text editor), anyway, adding support for the UTF-8 signature
is almost trivial. Therefore, many more editors support the UTF-8
signature today than ever supported ISO-2022.
