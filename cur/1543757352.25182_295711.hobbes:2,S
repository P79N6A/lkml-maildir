The last time I looked at this, the issue was that the user software did 
a large read and the ide-cd didn't properly return a small data block 
with no error, but rather returned an error with no data. If you get the 
size of the ISO image, you can read that with any program which doesn't 
try to read MORE than that.
I don't consider this correct behaviour, but at least I know how to get 
by it for iso-9660 CDs. For other formats which don't allow 
determination of data set size except by the contents of the data, this 
works poorly.
