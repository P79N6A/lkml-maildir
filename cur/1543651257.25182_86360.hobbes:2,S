net/ipv6/netfilter/ip6_queue.c says:
/*
 * Taken from net/ipv6/ip6_output.c
 * We should use the one there, but is defined static
 * so we put this just here and let the things as
 * they are now.
 *
 * If that one is modified, this one should be modified too.
 */
So, the reason why the copy of route6_me_harder() 
lives there is because net/ipv6/ip6_output.c has not been 
exported it.
Is this something to do with parser of extension headers?
Parser of extension headers is different thing, isn't it?
Yes, since duplication of code is bad unless there're really 
strong reasons.  I believe that there would be a better 
design for filtering.
