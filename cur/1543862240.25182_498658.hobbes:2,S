No, because the semantics are entirely different.  An application using 
read/write with O_DIRECT expects read() to block until data is 
physically fetched from the device.  fadvise() does not FORCE the kernel 
to discard cache, it only hints that it should, so a read() or mmap() 
very well may reuse a cached page instead of fetching from the disk 
again.  The application also expects write() to block until the data is 
on the disk.  In the case of a blocking write, you could splice/msync, 
but what about aio?
