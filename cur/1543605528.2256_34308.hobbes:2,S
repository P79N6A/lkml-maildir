What code base did you start from?  Linus' official 2.4.11-pre5
release, or the linuxppc_2_4_devel PPC development tree at
ppc.bkserver.net?  See 
http://www.penguinppc.org/dev/kernel.shtml
 for
details on how to access the PPC development tree.  That tree would
have the most up-to-date support for the MPC860T processor.

Hmmm, I don't know where that symbol would have come from, sorry.  It
doesn't appear anywhere in the kernel source that I can find.  Did you
add it?

I suggest you ask on the linuxppc-dev@lists.linuxppc.org mailing list,
you will find other hackers working on Linux for MPC8xx processors
there.
