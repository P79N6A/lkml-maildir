Well, maybe it makes sense to reduce flow of non-features patches
for a couple of days to let Linus feel less buried in email?
I think VM tweaking and such... It could be done after Linus
say what got in and what did not.
Although I doubt we can keep akpm/acme/davem/etc/etc/etc from hacking,
maybe there's a way to block SMTP traffic from them? ;)
(just kidding. They develop features as well)
