Conceptually, both patches are compatible.
Whether they are technically is for someone else to say...
Ingo's patch in effect lowers the number of jiffies taken per second in the
scheduler (by making each task use several jiffies).
Davide's patch can take the default scheduler (even Ingo's enhanced
scheduler) and make it per processor, with his extra layer of scheduling
between individual processors.
I think that together, they both win.  Davide's patch keeps a task from
switching CPUs very often, and Ingo's patch will make each task on each CPU
use the cache to the best extent for that task.
It remains to be proven whether the coarser scheduling approach (Ingo's) will
actually help when looking at cache properties....  When each task takes a
longer time slice, that allows the other tasks to be flushed out of the
caches during that time.  When the next task comes back in, it will have to
re-populate the cache again.  And the same for the next and etc...
