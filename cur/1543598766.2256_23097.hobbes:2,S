Well, at least on my system (RH 7.1) in rc.sysinit there's a fragment
that checks if ide-scsi is asked for and if so loads ide-cd first, so
it can grab CD drives that are not targeted for scsi emulation.
Personally, I've added a modprobe of ide-tape there so that ide-scsi 
can't grab any tape drives it is not supposed to either.

Right. And it is not limited to ide-scsi but impacts drivers that
connect to ide-scsi such as the osst tape driver I maintain which
would have to allow a device to be ht0 and osst0 at the user's choice...
