Uhmmm... that was my point.  Please re-read my post.

Chicken and egg problem.  Users have hardware and they want to run Linux
on it.  It's not always feasible for them to verify Linux compatibility
before they buy.  And some vendors like BenQ even ship a Linux CD with
their laptops even though the sound doesn't work on any BenQ system -
they obviously did not even try it.  So we have a large population of
users who would love to run Linux but can't until we support their
hardware.

There are many users who *really* want their hardware supported but
don't have the funds or the know-how to do any of these.  Like all of
these users:
