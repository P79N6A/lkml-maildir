I don't see what could be wrong. The PCI table has this PCI ID:
#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82810E_MC	0x7124
	...
	#define ID(x)						\
	{ 						\
	.class		= (PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_HOST << 8),	\
	.class_mask	= ~0,				\
	.vendor		= PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL,		\
	.device		= x,				\
	.subvendor	= PCI_ANY_ID,			\
	.subdevice	= PCI_ANY_ID,			\
	}
	...
	ID(PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82810E_MC),
We also tested it on some other machines and it worked.
Does anyone else see a problem in the patches? 
Sean, can you double check that when you compile the AGP driver as module
that the 7124 PCI ID appears in modinfo intel-agp ? 
And does the module also refuse to load ?
