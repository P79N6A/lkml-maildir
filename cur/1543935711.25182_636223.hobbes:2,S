Hello,
This patchset does fix iwl3945's races and some other stuff.
For now it works for just iwl3945 but if some of them is needed for iwl4965, I would work for it.

[PATCH 1/5] iwlwifi: iwl3945 flush interrupt mask
[PATCH 2/5] iwlwifi: iwl3945 synchronize interrupt and tasklet for down iwlwifi
[PATCH 3/5] iwlwifi: iwl3945 fix oops while pci remove
[PATCH 4/5] iwlwifi: iwl3945 eliminate sleepable task queue from context
[PATCH 5/5] iwlwifi: iwl3945 switch private workqueue to ieee80211->workqueue
