Test results of latest patch:
It seems that it works great for initrd, and for general ramdisk, but only
as long as CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD is defined.
However, the file won't even compile if ramdisk is configured without
initrd.  This is apparently due to initrd_fops being used outside of the
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD part.
The fact that RD_LOADER and BUILD_CRAMDISK are always defined at the top of
rd.c (except if MODULE is defined) also strikes me as very odd (but that is
not due to this particular fix).  Maybe the relationship between RD_LOADER
and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD is complicating things?
Regards,
Brad
