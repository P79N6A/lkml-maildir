It all looks quite nice, thanks.  Couple of things...
You've presumably run a kernel with these various things enabled.  What
happens?  Does the kernel run really slowly?  Does userspace collapse in a
heap?  Does it oops and die?
Also, one place where this infrastructure could be of benefit is in device
drivers: simulate a bad sector on the disk, a pulled cable, a timeout
reading from a status register, etc.  If that works well and is useful then
I can see us encouraging driver developers to wire up fault-injection in
the major drivers.
Hence it would be useful at some stage to go in and to actually do all this
for a particular driver.  As an example implementation for others to
emulate and as a test for the fault-injection infrastructure itself - we
may discover that new capabilities are needed as this work is done.
I wouldn't say this is an urgent thing to be doing, but it is a logical
next step..
