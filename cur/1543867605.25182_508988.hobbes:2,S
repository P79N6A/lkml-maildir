Yeah, this is a recurrent debate, and the positions are mixed. Linus
said that the nvidia driver isn't developed only for linux but also for
windows, so it's not a true derivative of the kernel, so the GPL doesn't
really apply. But not everyone (I mean core developpers) fully agrees
IIRC.
But that's not the case with VJ's drivers, which are apparently solely
for linux, so should be distributed under the GPL.
