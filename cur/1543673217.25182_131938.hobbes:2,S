There are none for MPPE.  It's just MPPC that has patent problems.

I have the compressor return a 3-valued return code (<0, 0, >0) instead of
two-valued (>0, other).  A negative value tells ppp_generic to drop the
packet.  0 means the same as it does now--the compressor failed for some
reason.  (All current compressors always return 0 or >0, so the negative
return is compatible.)
0 could also mean that CCP isn't up yet, but pppd userland doesn't allow
NCP's to come up until CCP completes (iff trying to negotiate MPPE).
Note that ECP would have this same problem, it's addressed the same way.
