Ok, have you _read_ the documentation on the driver model?  In it,
classes and devices are clearly spelled out as to what the differences
are, and what shows up where.
See Pat's linux.conf.au 2003 paper for much more detail.
And yes, I need to fix up the Documentation/driver_model/class.txt with
the most recent info...
In short, devices describe physical things that are present in the
computer system.  Classes describe a type of device, be it virtual or
physical.  Almost always, classes refer to something a user uses through
the /dev filesystem (like mice, tty, block, audio, etc.)
So no, there is not always a 1:1 mapping from classes to devices, that
is why the driver model does not enforce such a mapping at all.  You can
have multiple "struct class_device" structures that point to the same
"struct device" or no "struct device" at all.
Hope this helps to clear up the confusion that seems to be happening.
thanks,
