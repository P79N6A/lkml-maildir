Yes, exactly. Up to the first time need_resched() returns true and
the outer while(1){ } loop loops to update the idle-variable. Unfortunately
this never was the case on my system for a long time...
Probably the idle loop uses this local variable to be more cache-friendly,
but then any module updating pm_idle should probably set need_resched
to force an update of the idle function pointer?
