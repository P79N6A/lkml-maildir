Subject: Puzzled: Memory alignment is struct stat

In the kernel, the st_mode field of struct stat is 16 bit (unsigned
short).
In userland, it is unsigned int (32 bit on my machine). There must be
some
conversion between the two types, but I can't find it.
It's not in fs/stat.c...
I couldn't find it in glibc...
HELP!
Andreas
