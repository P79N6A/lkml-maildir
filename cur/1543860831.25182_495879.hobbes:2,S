As I have shown... no, that's not right. 32*2^32 operations is small
enough not to have problems with cosmic radiation.

I guess that is the way to go. samefile(path1, path2) is unfortunately
inherently racy.

How will that work for FAT?
Or maybe we can relax that "inode may not change over rename" and
"zero length files need unique inode numbers"...
