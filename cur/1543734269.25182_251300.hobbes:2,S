Yeah, that seems to be the case... the prism54 and usb-hcd drivers
might expect the irq to already be allocated, and when it's not on
resume they freak out.

alas, no. 
Unloading and reloading doesn't help. 
It looks like they don't re-allocate their irq resources on reload, so
they freak out. 
See the dmesg output I just posted showing the issue.
