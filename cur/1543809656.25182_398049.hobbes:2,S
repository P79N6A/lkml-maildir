Correct, this is precisely what happens.
Furthermore, the new exit-time futex code within the kernel will do only 
one, very limited thing with userspace memory: it will atomically set 
bit 30 of a word at a userspace address (if the word is accessible to 
and writable by userspace), if and only if that word is equal to 
current->pid. This is really not the sort of memory writing capability 
attackers are looking for :-)
Btw., we already have a similar mechanism in the kernel (and had for 
years): the current->clear_child_tid pointer will be overwritten with 0 
by the kernel at do_exit() time, and causes a futex wakeup. See 
kernel/fork.c:mm_release():
        if (tsk->clear_child_tid && atomic_read(&mm->mm_users) > 1) {
                u32 __user * tidptr = tsk->clear_child_tid;
                tsk->clear_child_tid = NULL;
                /*
                 * We don't check the error code - if userspace has
                 * not set up a proper pointer then tough luck.
                 */
                put_user(0, tidptr);
                sys_futex(tidptr, FUTEX_WAKE, 1, NULL, NULL, 0);
So the concept is not unprecedented at all, nor did it ever cause any 
security problems [and i think i'd know - i wrote the above code too].  
And 'write 0' is slightly more interesting to attackers than 'set bit 30 
if word equals to TID'.
