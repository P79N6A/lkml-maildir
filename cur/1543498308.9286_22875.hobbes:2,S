No, PCI is little endian. AD[1:0] addresses BE0#, the low order byte,
when addressing devices in I/O address space.
Memory mode devices do not interpret A[1:0] as address bits and instead
must use the BE# signals. Same for configuration space.
However, for all the things we do nowadays, PCI is pretty much endian
neutral in the domain of memory space.
