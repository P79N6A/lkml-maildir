thanks. your last comment about updatedb reminds me of my "server"'s kind of

Not counting hard drive spin-down or even standby, I find no reason for 
increased power consumption on swap prefetch mechanism, except for page 
syncing (swap&mem) and perhaps upon process killing...
Question: Imagine some big app like firefox completely swapped. killing it 
implies swapping out the process memory entirely to free allocated pages?
- If it does, then your swap prefetch may not increase power consumption by a 
measurable margin, because some of that swapped information was prefetched.
- If it does not, than prefetched swapped pages could be useless if the 
applications dies.
I don't know enough about the kernel VM to answer this on my own.

pedro venda.
