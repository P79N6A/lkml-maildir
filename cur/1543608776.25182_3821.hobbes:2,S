Absolutly true. 
You can get a 90% solution by testing for tty and for proces that has a
connection to a tcp port between 6000 and 6100 somewhere or has a unix
socket to /tmp/.X11-unix/X0 (or whereever X chooses to place the unix
socket). 
But thats definitly not good enough to base your scheduling on.

    It depends whether you're looking for an idea of who's on, or you want a definitive count. The lattter is basically almost impossible. What if a logged-in user nohups two xterms to different X-servers, then logs out - how many people are logged in? I've spent a hell of a long time working on this on AIX for a certain German bank, and the bottom line is that it can't be done. What is 'logged on' anyway? Someone running bash or ksh, that's cool, but what about someone running /home/fred/myprog? Is it a shell?
    Basically once Unix went beyond serial terminals connected to dumb serial ports, we lost the ability to track users.
