How large was Netscape at this point? I find it's a horrible
application that leaks like a sieve at times so I always wrap it with
something like the attached script.

#!/bin/bash
export MOZILLA_HOME=/usr/local/netscape
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/netscape/lib
# netscape should normally not use this much memory

ulimit -v 40960
# sigh, netscape dumps core often
