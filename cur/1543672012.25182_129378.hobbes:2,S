A patch against 2.5.68-bk11 plus your patch is attached.
I removed all references to blk.h and blk.h does now #error. If people 
want their drivers to run unmodified under 2.4 it might be necessary to 
do a
  #if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,69)
  #include <linux/blk.h>
  #endif
I've tested the compilation with a .config that tries to compile as much 
drivers as possible.
