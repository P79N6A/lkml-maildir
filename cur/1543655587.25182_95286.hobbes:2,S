This assumption is wrong.  It is totally possible for TASK_SIZE
to be the entire 64-bit address space on sparc64 and thus larger
than SIZE_MAX - PAGE_SIZE, and I definitely plan on supporting
that.
User processes live entirely in their very own address space seperate
from the kernel, so kernel stuff does not take up any part of the user
virtual addresses.
Please revert this change, it adds absolutely nothing.
