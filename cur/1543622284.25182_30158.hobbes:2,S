Hi!
After some more careful testing, I was able to identify the exact moment
when the changes in the Linux kernel broke SPDIF passthru of Emu10k1
cards. I tested all the pre-patches between kernels 2.4.12 and 2.4.13
and I found that kernel 2.4.13-pre2 was the one that broke it. Up until
2.4.13-pre1, everything works fine. From 2.4.13-pre2 on, passthru sound
is broken (if kernel option CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G or CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G is
used).
According to the kernel Changelog, it appears that one of these changes
was the responsible for it:
2.4.13-pre2:
- Alan Cox: more merging
- Ben Fennema: UDF module license
- Jeff Mahoney: reiserfs endian safeness
- Chris Mason: reiserfs O_SYNC/fsync performance improvements
- Jean Tourrilhes: wireless extension update
- Joerg Reuter: AX.25 updates
- David Miller: 64-bit DMA interfaces
I hope this helps and I hope you can fix it soon.
Regards
Zé
