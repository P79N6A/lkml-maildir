   No, it will slow down ia64 and you haven't shown that it helps others.
That's crap.  You haven't shown this yet, it didn't slow down sparc64
so I doubt you'll be able to.
You don't have any facts, you just "think" it will slow things down
because of the pointer dereference.  I challenge you to show it
actually shows up on the performance radar.
The thing is going to be fully hot in the cache all the time, there
is no way you'll take a cache miss for this dereference.
