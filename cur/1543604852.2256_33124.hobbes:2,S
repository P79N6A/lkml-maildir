I simply meant that with the application in control of packet size, you
simply can't make a reliable estimate of maximum receive MSS unless our
assumption that only maximum sized segments don't have PSH.

Whatever.

I know.

I know. It's a difficult tradeoff between saving bandwidth on the return
path, trying to maintain self clocking, and avoiding bursts caused by
ack compression.

Why? This one has me stumped.
