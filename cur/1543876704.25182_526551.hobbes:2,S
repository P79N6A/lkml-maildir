This is not about efficiency.  When have I *ever* posted optimization
patches?
This is about clarity.  We have a standard convention for
register/unregister.  And they can't fail.  Either of these would be
sufficient to justify a change.
Too many people doing cool new things in the kernel, not enough
polishing of the crap that's already there 8(

Sure, I'll apply on top of that patch.
Thanks!
