And GCC does not care about that, i.e. it still prints foritfy warnings, 
as in:
$ svn co 
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ttyrpld/trunk
 a && cd a
$ make user/rpld.o EXT_CFLAGS="-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2"
user/rpld.c:425: warning: ignoring return value of ‘write’, declared 
with attribute warn_unused_result
Adding (void) to the front to line 425 does not get rid of the warning. 
So doing so does not seem to be the right way to let others know you 
intentionally want to discard the return value. Plus, on top, many 
(sometimes older) C books advise to cast to (void) just because 
something does not return it.
