Hi,
I'd like to have an idea of how the powerop would evolve to address:
a) exporting all operating points to sysfs - that would be useful for
a policy manager in user space, or the user policy will already be
aware of the ops?
b) Constraints: if I would like to change to a op and such a
transition is not allowed in hardware, what part of the software will
test it? The set/get powerop functions, the higher layers or even some
lower layer (don't know if expected) ?
thanks,
Daniel
