The kernel doesn't actually do anything with the
"tainted" flag, insmod does. So you have to compile
things as module and insmod them, and insmod will
dump a message if the MODULE_LICENSE thing isn't
in the module. If you compile things inside the
kernel instead of modules, you will see nothing and
/proc/sys/kernel/tainted will contain 0, which
is wrong.
