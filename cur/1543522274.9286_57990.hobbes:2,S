Indeed, I just wonder about the possibility of a process getting a
pid of 40K or thereabouts from an IPC structure -- then sign
extending it and using it for kill(2)
Ouch.

Hmm... how about we fix the pid_t width in the IPC structure if it
has not been done so already, then in 2.5.x we can raise the limit;
that way -- 2.5.x testers will find these problems and hopefully fix
them, whether or not authors do. This is what I was alluding too.
Commercial vendors will need more prodding, and sadly because even
the glibc-2.1.2 IPC structures need updating, things like Oracle
_will_ break...
