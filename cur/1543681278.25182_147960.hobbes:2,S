Hmmm... Starvation is back for me (Pentium III 700Mhz + ACPI):
1. Log on to X/KDE
2. Launch Konqueror
3. Launch XMMS
4. Make XMMS play a song
5. Move the Konqueror window all over the desktop.
Step 5 causes XMMS to completely starve for exactly 5 seconds. After
those 5 seconds, the XMMS priority gets adjusted and sound comes back
from my speakers.
Another way to starve XMMS for 5 seconds:
1. Launch XMMS
2. Make it play
3. Run a standard CPU hogger: "while true; do a=2; done"
Step 3 will make XMMS starve for exactly 5 seconds. Also, during those 5
seconds, X is completely jerky and moving the mouse makes the pointer
goes jumping all over the screen.
Do you want additional information? Any patch trying?
Thanks!
