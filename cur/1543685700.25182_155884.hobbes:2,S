Re,
Assuming some people are willing to test but don't want to play with a stack
of patches, there is a single patch including the whole serie of changes at:
<URL:
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/linux/kernel/2.6.x/2.6.0-test3/extra/atm-seq_file.patch>
Patch should be 2.6.0-test2-xxx agnostic.
Please test and send full content of /proc/net/atm before/after the patch if
things change.
