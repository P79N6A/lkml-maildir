Yes, or the reverse, to avoid two loops and possible sum errors (Sum of c<proc>=count different than the global count)
Since text##_show is going to be too big, you could use one function instead of several ones ?
(and char *buf is PAGE_SIZE, so you should add a limit ?)
Note I used for_each_possible_cpu() here instead of 'online' variant, or stats might be corrupted when a cpu goes offline.
static ssize_t text_show(struct kmem_cache *s, char *buf, unsigned int si)
{								
	unsigned long val, sum = 0;					
	int cpu;
	size_t off = 0;						
	size_t buflen = PAGE_SIZE;
								
	for_each_possible_cpu(cpu) {				
		val = get_cpu_slab(s, cpu)->stat[si];
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
		if (val)
			off += snprintf(buf + off, buflen - off, "c%d=%lu ", cpu, val);
#endif
		sum += val;		
        }
	off += snprintf(buf + off, buflen - off, "%lu\n", sum);			
	return off;
}
