The newest ac is always what is recommended.  Right now that is
2.4.10-ac11.  You will need linux-2.4.10.tar.bz2 and
patch-2.4.10-ac11.bz2.
That code is very stable and has Rik's VM.  It should have the newest
netfilter code -- Alan is very up to date.
This isn't to say not to use Linus's tree, though.  You may want to give
2.4.12 a try, too.
