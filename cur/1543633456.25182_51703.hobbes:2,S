Thank you! Andreas,
I do directly login at the console as root and
e2fsprogs-1.27 is used. ulimit is not set.

<< You must log in directly at the console as root
(no su or sudo), or disable any ulimit from being
set.
Alternately, if you get the very latest e2fsprogs
(1.27) then it
should also be able to work around this problem. >>
