sys_free_node_memory() - nice.
Does it make sense to also have it be able to free up slab cache,
calling shrink_slab()?
Did you mean to pass a nodemask, or a single node id?  Passing a single
node id is easier - we've shown that it is difficult to pass bitmaps
across the user/kernel boundary without confusions.  But if only a
single node id is passed, then you get the thread per node that you just
argued was sometimes overkill.
I'd prefer the single node id, because it's easier to get right.
