Just a small nitpick...
Can you please drop the "- exploit attempt" from the error?  Buffer
overflows aren't always exploits.
I already have a problem with jumpy users to blame everything on "hackers"
I'd much rather have someone qualified come to that conclusion rather than
the kernel making a bad guess at it.
