Indeed. 'ndiswrapper' is intentionally tainted by kernel/module.c because it 
is used to load and run unknown binary / proprietary code in kernel-space. If 
this unknown binary / proprietary code were to contain a bug (which all code 
of that complexity tends to), it might write to memory it doesn't own, or 
coerce a device to do so on its behalf, making a kernel crash dump analysis 
into a wild goose chase (hence the reason for kernel taint).

Are you saying ndiswrapper voluntarily calls add_taint() whenever it loads an 
NDIS driver?
Are there even any examples of GPL-licensed NDIS drivers?
