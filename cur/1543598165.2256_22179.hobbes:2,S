Hmm.  The numbers were off the top of my head and I've been messing
with DDR SDRAM quite a bit so I may have doubled it.   Hmm.
Nope.  I was remember something close to the typical streams numbers
on an Athlon with DDR SDRAM.  Since those are read-modify-write
numbers they should be close to the write numbers for normal SDRAM.
With a PII/PIII and PC100 SDRAM I have measured about 640 MB/s writes.

However just looking at your numbers, I would guess that there is
something off.  Read numbers should almost always be worse then write
numbers on SDRAM, because reads have a latency between the command and
the first data cycle.  Writes do not have that delay.  
Compare what you have to streams.  But those numbers from Memtest.c
don't look correct at all.
