For some reason, the interpretation of the mem= kernel parameter was
changed. I ran into this myself. The value is now used to limit the
memory size, not overrule it. There is a different syntax for adding
memory. One of my computers has 128 Mb, of which only 64 Mb are
detected. I had to add the "mem=63m@65m" kernel parameter, resulting in:
BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
BIOS-88: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009f000 (usable)
BIOS-88: 0000000000100000 - 00000000040ffc00 (usable)
128MB LOWMEM available.
On node 0 totalpages: 32768
zone(0): 4096 pages.
zone(1): 28672 pages.
zone(2): 0 pages.
Unfortunately, this is not documented. Look at arch/i386/kernel/setup.c
for details.
