I see that this fix was committed to mainline as commit
be852795e1c8d3829ddf3cb1ce806113611fa555
The commit didn't "Cc: <stable@kernel.org>", and it doesn't appear to
be queued for 2.6.24.x.  Should it be?
If I understand you correctly, SLAB doesn't create this particular
cache thrashing on 32bit systems?  Is SLAB ok on other architectures
too?  Can you (or others) comment on the importance of this fix
relative to x86_64 (64byte cacheline) and SLAB?
I'm particularly interested in this given the use of percpu_counters
with the per bdi write throttling.
