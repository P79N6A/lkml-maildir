Sorry to disappoint you, but it just hung for me again.
After seeing the backport of commit  c59697e06058fc2361da8cefcfa3de85ac107582 as
"sky2: restore workarounds for lost interrupts" going into 2.6.22.5 I
decided to give it another try.
First tests worked and for two days I had no trouble, but today the
network hung again, until I removed and reinserted the sky2 module.
I'm using the Gentoo kernel 2.6.22-gentoo-r6 which is based on
2.6.22.6. (All patches at
http://dev.gentoo.org/~dsd/genpatches/patches-2.6.22-7.htm
 )
This is as x86_64 kernel but with a 32bit userland.

Now the network was up again, but around one hour later it hung again.
Again after removing and reinserting the module it started to work
again, this time until I went home.
I switched back to the Realtek 8139, as that card works.
I can provide more info about the hardware, but I can't test any
patches, as this server is needed for work and random hangs after
hours of working are not really the nicest things to debug.
