Perhaps some of these fixes should be a configure-time
option? Most of the distros would compile them in, but those
who wish for the sleekest kernel possible would take them
out?
Precedence for this is buggy MB chipsets--CMD640, for
example.
Personally, I think it is very cool when Linux can work with
something else which is buggy.
