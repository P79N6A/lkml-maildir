So it's an incompatible extension, which tells me that you'll need to
set another incompatibility flag in case there's any >2TB file (like
ext3 does that when the filesystem's journal contains data).

...but consider what's happening in the case you're first running a
patched kernel, create some >2TB files, then start an unpatched kernel
and work with those (formerly >2TB) files.
First of all, the files will look like being %= 2TB (albeit that, I
think with any >2TB file, you'd need to set an incompatibility flag so
that an unpatched ext3fs actually *refuses* to mount any FS containing a
file >2TB). What happens if you rename() such a file? What happens if
you use a pre-2TB ext2fs with it?
Sounds like an incompatible extension, so you need to mark it as one:)

If you were "offered" several chooses, why did you take this one, which
is used by the HURD? Were other possibilities already used for other
purposes?

They're "compatible" as long as there's no data in the journal; with
data in the journal, ext3 marks itself as being incompatible ext2. This
is what >2TB filesize support probably needs to do, too.
