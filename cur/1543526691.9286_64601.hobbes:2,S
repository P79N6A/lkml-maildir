Ok IP_RCVERR seems to help. Except of course that its not back compatible,
while the SO_BSDCOMPAT option is very much so and if the libc folks have
been paying attention is automatic for code built FAVOUR_BSD.
glibc doesn't use IP_RECVERR nor do the NIS libraries. If we make this change
the C libraries will need fixing, and for some dialup configurations libc5
will also need fixing really.
So why not use the existing API SO_BSDCOMPAT option. Its been there for four
years and doesn't break back compatibility of the BSD cases.
