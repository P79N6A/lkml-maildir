It's a bit disappointing to route around the newly-added
/proc/pid/coredump_filter.  It's inherited across fork so where's the
problem?  Just set init's mask appropriately at boot if that's what you
want.
Plus making it system-wide is fairly sucky compared to making it settable
per-process-tree.
And you had to add considerably more code this way.

hm, I'm now wondering whether testing i_nlink was the best (or official)
way of determining whether a MAP_SHARED vma is anonymous or file-backed.
Hugh will know.

It was peculiar of us to use bitops against a local variable - normally
we'd use open-coded &'s here.  Maybe it's OK - test_bit() is pretty cheap
(on x86, at least), but one wonders whether gcc could do better if it knew
what was going on.

The above makes elf_core_dump_sysctls[] inaccessible from here on.  It will
warn, surely?
