It's not MY patch.  It's Alan & Arjans works, and I stated that clearly in
the thread a few days ago, where someone posted a patch to bring the XFree
crap in.  I expect from someone who thinks of himself as kerneltree
maintainer that he atleast follows lkml, and watching the most important
secondary tree (-ac) won't hurt either.
