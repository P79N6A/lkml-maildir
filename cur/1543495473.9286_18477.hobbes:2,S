I have a patch (I'm planning to submit in early 2.3) that causes
a.out binaries that ar 1kB aligned to be read totally into anonymous memory
when they are started, keeping functionality but not optimum memory sharing...
That way in 2.3 we can just drop support for them.
But if you want the patch sooner I can pick it up and send it to you.
