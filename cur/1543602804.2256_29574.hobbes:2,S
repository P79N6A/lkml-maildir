Hello!
Is there a way to map user space memory into kernel address space, e.g.
that i don't have to call get_user(var,...) but simply use var =
*user_space_ptr?
What i intend to do (as the next step) is to DMA-transfer data directly
between a PCI device and user space memory. The buffer in user space
should be allocated with malloc(), so allocating a buffer in kernel and
mmap()-ping it to user space is not the solution..
I guess this has been asked before, any links to further information
would be great.
Thanks
Norbert
