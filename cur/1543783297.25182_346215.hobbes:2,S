The problem is that x86_cpu_to_apicid[] only gets set for processors
that successfully came online in do_boot_cpu():
        ... 
        if (boot_error) {
                /* Try to put things back the way they were before ...
*/
                unmap_cpu_to_logical_apicid(cpu);
                cpu_clear(cpu, cpu_callout_map); /* was set here
(do_boot_cpu()) */
                cpu_clear(cpu, cpu_initialized); /* was set by
cpu_init() */
                cpucount--;
        } else {
                x86_cpu_to_apicid[cpu] = apicid;
                cpu_set(cpu, cpu_present_map);
        }
        ...
And in case of the "new" CPU the "inactive" APIC ID is needed, which was
recorded in bios_cpu_apicid[].

I changed it from present to possible CPUS to create nodes for both
present and absent CPUs, the latter have online=0. This way we can bring
them up if they become physically available.

I think that would be great. And maybe __cpu_up() should log a message.
