You can't tell who the user is. ANY user would be able to do that.

And just how is it prevented? quotas are applied based on either group
or user. Normally it is based on user. Once the uid is set, then the
quotas start being deducted. If the the user procedes to store 10 G of
music files, who is charged? And how do you know who put them there.

Then use FreeBSD.
