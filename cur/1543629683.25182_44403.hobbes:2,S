Hm, interesting.  When Ingo removed the sync variants of wake_up he did
it believing the load balancer would handle the case.  Apparently, at
least in this case, that assumption was wrong.
I agree with your earlier statement, though - this benchmark may be a
case where it shows up negatively but in general the balancing is
preferred.  I can think of plenty of workloads where that is the case. 
I also wonder if over time the load balancer would end up putting the
tasks on the same CPU.  That is something the quick pipe benchmark would
not show.

In 2.5 nor the 2.4 backport I did (what is in -ac) I don't think the
sync flag is being passed down since the functionality was removed.  The
functions were rewritten I believe to not have that parameter at all.
It is just for pipes we previously used sync, no?
