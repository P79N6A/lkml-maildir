To be more precise, a platform has every right to return some kind of
"token" from ioport_map/pci_iomap that encodes the type of address, and
that is -different- from what a normal ioremap does. In which case, you
will -not- be able to use readb/writeb & cie on such a token.
The fact that current implementations seem to return something for MMIO
that is equivalent to what ioremap returns is an accident and cannot be
relied upon.
Cheers,
Ben.
