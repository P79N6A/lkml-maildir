No. The size of the headers depends on the allocation size: 8 bytes for 
allocs < 4088 bytes, 60 bytes for larger allocs. I don't want to expose 
that implementation detail outside of util.c.
ipc_rcu_alloc allocates an arbitrary sized refcounted memory block that 
is released through the rcu framework. Everything else is hidden in util.c.
