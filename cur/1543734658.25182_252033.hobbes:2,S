Yeah, the !CONFIG_MMU code behind this is probably a little stale.
The thinking has mostly been to keep things as much the same as
possible, even if the fields didn't have a sensible meaning in
non-mmu space.

In at least one case this is true now, as you mention for the
VmXxx fields. But looking at these now I think we could actually
implement most of them in a sensible way for the no-mmu case.
Size, Exe, Lib, Stk, etc  all apply with their conventional
meanings.

Reality for non-mmu targets is that most apps just won't be fixed
for them, so we try real hard to make the world look like it is
just like any other linux architecture.
I think !CONFIG_MMU case can be cleaned up to make it almost identical
to the CONFIG_MMU case, and reporting sensible values for just about
all fields.
