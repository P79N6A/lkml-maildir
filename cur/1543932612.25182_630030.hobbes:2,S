why would this patch reduce wakeups even more than round_jiffies()? Does it make
our ~2 second update interval not reliable? can you quantify "shows it reduces" ?
Or timer only runs once every two seconds...
maybe I just don't understand the effect of timer_set_deferrable() - we're already
deferring it ourselves when we want to. If that is not working then I suggest that
we fix that first instead of postponing the critical first run of the e1000
watchdog task.
People in the datacenter really don't want to see more delays when bringing up
link, and we get frequent calls about it already being long on gigabit (not even
minding spanning tree). Adding 25% to that time isn't going to down very nicely
with them.
