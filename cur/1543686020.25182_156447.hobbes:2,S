It was plus and minus. I've improved my hacks, but the A3 patch nanosecond 
timing will add extra overhead/locking. I'm not sure how you can compare 
these to the last ones you posted:
                              Elapsed      System        User         CPU
              2.6.0-test2       46.05      115.20      571.75     1491.25
          2.6.0-test2-con       46.98      121.02      583.55     1498.75
          2.6.0-test2-mm1       46.95      121.18      582.00     1497.50
I'll take a stab in the dark and say the nanosecond timing is a big part now. 
Backing out all the O*int patches in broken-out of 2.6.0-test3-mm1 should 
help identify that. 
I have an idea on how to trim the nanosecond overhead as well. The sched clock 
should be called if the timing is less than say two jiffies only. That will 
mean it will be called far less frequently.
