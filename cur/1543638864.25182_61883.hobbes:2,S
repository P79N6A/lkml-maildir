Makes sense to me. Martin?

Right. I guess this one falls more in the category "If anyone wants to build
an s390 2.4.19 kernel, use this patch, because it's what we have tested at 
IBM".
Since the 18 patches reflect what our recommended 2.4.17 patch contains 
(roughly sorted by relevance), not all of it is necessarily good for 2.4.20.
You can see it as "this is all we have -- take what you like". Of course,
anything that gets merged makes life easier for us.
