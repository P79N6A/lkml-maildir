Subject: random failure mounting root fs

I'm have an entire self-installing app on a bootable cd created using mkisofs.  I use isolinux bootloader to boot from cd with root=/dev/hda (my cdrom drive).  Sometimes the process works fine, root is mounted and INIT starts up.  Others I get this
attempt to access beyond end of device
03:00: rw=0, want=33, limit=2
isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=03:00, iso_blknum=16, block=32
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:00
I am not understanding why I would get such a random failure.  Does this have to do with the CDROM drive speed?  Is it preventable?
mkisofs v1.13
isolinux v1.76
2.2 and 2.4 kernels
Thanks
Lee
