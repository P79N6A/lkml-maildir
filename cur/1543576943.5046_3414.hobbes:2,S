Looks good here in most respects, but still needs makefile fixes -
# modprobe tdfx
/lib/modules/2.4.0-prerelease/kernel/drivers/char/drm/tdfx.o: unresolved
symbol remap_page_range
/lib/modules/2.4.0-prerelease/kernel/drivers/char/drm/tdfx.o: unresolved
symbol __wake_up
/lib/modules/2.4.0-prerelease/kernel/drivers/char/drm/tdfx.o: unresolved
symbol mtrr_add
.... etc, etc
Of course, adding
#include <linux/modversions.h>
to drivers/char/drm/drmP.h makes it all work....
