So the sensible thing to do is, again, to criticize the code, not the
coder.
There are multiple reasons for that:
a) The code is what counts.
b) People take personal attacks, well, personally.  It causes
   unnecessary bad blood.
c) There are people who will produce beautiful code one minute, and
   complete shitpiles the next one.
If a certain piece of code is a shitpile, go ahead and say so.  Please
do, however, explain why that is, and please give the maintainer a
chance to listen before being flamed publically.
