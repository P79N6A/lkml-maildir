Any halfway decent jail will let you control access to all of those
things, thereby preventing an 0wned httpd from breaking out of the jail.
(For instance, Janus did.  So does Systrace.)
Are you saying AppArmor does not allow that kind of control?  Specifics
would be useful.

I don't understand what you are saying.  Yes, the AppArmor policy
