I've tried kernel version 2.6.16 (with version 7 of the aic7xxx
driver).  Same problem.

I've tried two different PCI slots and two different SCSI cables.
Same problem.  I've enabled PCI parity checking via the pci_parity
option to the aic7xxx driver, but I don't see any parity errors in the
kernel messages.
I'm having trouble believing that this could be a hardware problem
because I can consistently read data from the SCSI disks, the
corruption only seems to happen during writes.
Thanks for your suggestions.
