Can we have more descriptive patch summaries in future?  At least
include the subsystem!
Here's the description I dug out of the web interface to git:
"netlink overrun was broken while improvement of netlink. Destination
socket is used in the place where it was meant to be source socket, so
that now overrun is never sent to user netlink sockets, when it should
be, and it even can be set on kernel socket, which results in complete
deadlock of rtnetlink."
