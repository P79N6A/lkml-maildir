Yes indeed, that tripped me up. Have been using the "=A" locally for a while 
for similar timing tests. Will use a manual "=a" (lo), "=d" (hi) I guess for 
amd64 compatibility from now on.
If I'd care deeply I'd probably categorize this as a backwards compatibility 
bug in GCC though. Things were probably never guaranteed but they certainly 
worked that way...
