When I mentioned 820 that was just what was missing from the histogram 
data vs. the total samples. As for why this number showed up again, dumb 
luck? What the histogram represents is usecs (left column) between 
interrupt and read. The right column is the number of occurrences. What 
this tells me is that you had 820 samples that were greater than 9.999ms.
I took a brief look at the tvtime code. I noticed several things:
1) tvtime sets the interrupt frequency for the rtc to 1024 Hz which 
would imply that you should have had roughly 30000 samples in a 30 
second run, minus initial setup time. The histogram only shows 10430 
samples. I have no way of knowing if the setup time is really that long 
or if you are missing some interrupts. Unfortunately the rtc histogram 
stuff doesn't currently track missed interrupts except to print out the 
messages you were seeing
"<some process> is being piggy... Read missed before next interrupt"
2) tvtime is probably running at a RT priority of 99. The IRQ handler 
for the rtc defaults to 48-49 (I think). If you didn't already do so, 
you should bump the priority up as in:
chrt -f -p 99 `/sbin/pidof 'IRQ 8'`
Try that and see if it helps at all.
