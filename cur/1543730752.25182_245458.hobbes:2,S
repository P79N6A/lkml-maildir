Hello,
Sorry to post to the list without being subscribed, but I've searched the
web for information on this and I can't find anything useful.  I'm currenty
building a realtime visualization system for a Space Shuttle landing
simulator at NASA.  I'm using a small network of 5 Pentium 4 computers
running RedHat's 2.4.20-31.9 kernel.  I'm easily running 60 frames/second on
my systems, but I'm having a problem because the kscand/Normal thread comes
in every 25 seconds and causes me to drop a frame (very annoying).  I've
looked into the kernel source and found where the kscand threads are
spawned.  I also see where the 25 second period is coming from.  What I'm
wondering is what would happen if I disabled the kscand/Normal thread?  I've
got plenty of memory, and my process is the only thing running on the
system.  Would I eventually see problems, or would I be OK since I'm not
running low on memory?  What if I modified the kernel to allow me to
temporarily disable the thread while my application is running (using a
/proc file or something similar)?  Sorry if this is a bad question, but I
figure the people on this list are the best source of info.
Please CC: me directly since I'm not subscribed to the list. 
Thanks for any help or suggestions,
Corbin
