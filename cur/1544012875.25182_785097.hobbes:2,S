It might be possible, but for correctness DEFINE_TRACE() should use
__always_inline instead of inline.
But it is quite pointless. Sometimes we need _RET_IP_, sometimes
_THIS_IP_ and sometimes a parameter we've been passed. That's because we
want the IP of the caller, so it depends on whether this slab function
is __always_inline, non-inlined or deeply nested within other functions
(which can be as well __always_inline or non-inlined).
