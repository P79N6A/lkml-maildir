Well what would need in a general case situation here would be task_lock,
for the two tasks.  Having that as long as all of the operations happened
under the lock it wouldn't matter.  In this case the init_task is known
not to change, and no one else should be messing with current.
I am beginning to suspect that we will want to fix kernel_thread so it
creates copies of the init_task rather than copies of whatever random
user space process we happen to be a member of at the time.  With an
enhanced kernel_thread this problem could more easily avoided, as
we add additional namespaces to the kernel.
The problem with a kernel thread running in a private namespace like this
is that you can't kill the kernel thread and when it is the last user
of a private namespace.  So you can never free up your mounts etc.
As for this patch in particular matching the style that is already there for
a bug fix seems to make a lot of sense :)
