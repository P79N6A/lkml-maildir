I'm not sure.  What about a chip driver that would belong to more than
one class?  What about the eeprom driver which will belong to all
classes?  With a numeric value, a simple binary operation handles all
the cases.  With text strings we would end having to parse a possibly
multi-valued string, and do string comparisons, with at least one
exception to handle.  This is likely to require much more resources,
don't you think?
