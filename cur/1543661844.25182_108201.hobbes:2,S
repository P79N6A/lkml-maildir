Interesting. Especially as the last thing exit_notify() does (just a few 
lines above the schedule()) is to do
        tsk->state = TASK_ZOMBIE;
and that schedule() _really_ really shouldn't return. Regardless of any 
signal handler changes.
By then we also have local interrupts disabled, and we've explicitly 
disabled preemption, so I don't see how anything could ever wake us up any 
more. 
But yes, I'd agree with your line-up, if for no other reason than the fact 
that I don't really see anything else even _remotely_ likely to muck 
around with process state.
I don't see this (obviously), but could you make "try_to_wake_up()" (in 
kernel/sched.c) do a
	BUG_ON(p->state & TASK_ZOMBIE);
to see if somebody tries to wake up a zombie task (maybe the signal 
handler stuff does that under some unlucky circumstances).
And then the call trace would be very interesting indeed if the above bug 
triggers.. (and unlike the do_exit() bug, the tri_to_wake_up() thing 
should clearly pinpoint where the problem actually happens, knock wood).
