Just to clarify: define "small".  My current laptop has half a gigabyte of 
ram.  (Yeah, I broke down and bought a real machine, and even kept a World of 
Warcraft partition this time...)
Does small mean "this is better for laptops with < 4gig"?  In which case, 
possibly this should be tied to CONFIG_HIGHMEM or some such?
