Aha, thanks ;-)
$ dpkg -S /usr/lib/libasound.so.2.0.0
libasound2: /usr/lib/libasound.so.2.0.0
Package: libasound2
Versions: 
0.9.0beta10a-3(/var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.debian.org_debian_dists_stable_main_binary-i386_Packages)(/var/lib/dpkg/status)
Which is probably horribly old, knowing Debian stable ;-)

Thanks, it was on OSS - there's no ALSA selection, nor can I find one.
There's probably one in unstable somewhere, but ... see below.

I'll play with it - should narrow things down. However, fundamentally,
it used to work in 2.5.74, and is broken as of test3 ... that strongly
implies to me there's a kernel problem. I'd rather fix OSS emulation
if possible, and save everybody migrating to 2.6 from this pain ... ;-)
