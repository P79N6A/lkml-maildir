"Power off during write operations may make an incomplete sector which
will report hard data error when read. The sector can be recovered by a
rewrite operation."

Deskstar 60GXP specifications, section 6.0
The above quote and URL are IBM's official word, from their OEM
specification manual.  FWIW, I checked the OEM manual for the 73LZX as
well (not that that drive is available anywhere, but I wanted to see
what IBM did/is doing for that drive), and the corresponding section in
that manual mentions nothing about incomplete sectors causing hard
errors. I just checked the 36LZX OEM spec as well and that also omits
the same clause.
OTOH, A few hours ago I checked the specs for several TravelStars and they
mentioned this incomplete sector thing. So, I guess IBM's position on
this is that this failure mode is OK for IDE drives but not for SCSI.
Here's a starting point for finding the IBM manuals:

(Just for my curiosity, I checked for the microdrives too. The phrasing
is different there: "There is a possibility that power off during a
write operation might make a maximum of 1 sector of data unreadable.
This state can be recovered by a rewrite operation.")
