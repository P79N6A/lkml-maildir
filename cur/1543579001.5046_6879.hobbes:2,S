Got that in the other mail subjected "More information ... ". In the
meantime it seems the filesystem is unhurt because of this, but reiserfsck
says
uread_super_block: bad block is found at a new superblock location
uread_super_block: bad block is found at an old superblock location
which seems bogus. This is reiserfsck from the same suite that mkreiserfs
came from ("reiserfsprogs 3.x") so they should be talking about the same
sort of filesystem.
