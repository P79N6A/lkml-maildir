I also note that part of the problem that motivates the even/odd thing 
is a tacit acknowledgement that people only _really_ test the official 
releases.
Which IMHO backs up my opinion that we simply need more frequent releases.
Part of this is a scalability problem.  Linux probably has more changes 
flowing into it than any other OS kernel on the planet.  We must deal 
with an ever-increasing number of changesets in a way that produces a 
usable kernel for our users.
