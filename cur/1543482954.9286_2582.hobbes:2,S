Incorrect, see my previous email. It may not be strictly necessary right
now due to us probably holding the kernel lock everywhere, but it is
conceptually necessary, and it is _not_ an argument for a spinlock.
The /proc code has to be fixed, but the easy fix is to just revert to the
old one as far as I can see. I shouldn't have accepted the /proc patches
in the first place, and I'm sorry I did.
