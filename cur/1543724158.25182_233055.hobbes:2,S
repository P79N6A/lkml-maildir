Well, I have the same system (board is Deluxe version) and no such situation.

Hmm, I don't have this though. "IO-APIC-edge  timer" is the closest in my box.

Well, the "usual answer" is try enable/disable PREEMPT, upgrade BIOS.
Also IO-APIC and APIC as a whole.
Here is my board:
$ cat /proc/interrupts 
           CPU0

  9:          0   IO-APIC-level  acpi
 14:     865112    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
 15:       9195    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
