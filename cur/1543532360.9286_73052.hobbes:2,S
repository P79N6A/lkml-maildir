Hmm... I should have been clearer with my english. If I use
SIGEV_THREAD, in sigevent I set a function (sigev_notify_function) and
thread attributes (sigev_notify_attributes). When the signal occurs,
instead of going through a signal handler, the sigev_notify_function
is invoked with sigval as an argument in a thread with attributes
which match sigev_notify_attributes. It's like having a signal handler
that invokes pthread_create(), only much faster, and of course, POSIX
makes no guarantees that you can actually invoke pthread_create() in a
signal handler.
While it's undoubtedly doable in user-space, the whole idea of that
feature is to avoid signal-handling overhead (and replace it with
thread creation overhead I guess ;-). I'm not sure how one would do
THAT in user space without some kind of kernel support.
