In most countries nowadays, this is correct.

No, but since you own the copyright, you can give rights to the material to the operator of the Open Logging server.
Why don't we have a system whereby we automatically assign copyright to one person, (I.E. Linus), who can then assign us GPL rights in return, so that by submitting material to any server, we are not able to assign anything other than GPL rights to it's owner.
This is, I believe, although I could be wrong, the reason that the Free Software Foundation allows you to assign copyrights to them.
