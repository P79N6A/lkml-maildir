No it doesn't. That's the point.
Unless I'm mistaken, in which case would you be so kind as to point me at
an example of userspace code which accesses HFS forks, NTFS streams,
as well as HPFS and BeFS EAs, without resorting to direct manipulation of
the device (hence rendering any compatibility with filesystem
implementation changes null and void)?
If so, then I'm happy, because this is what I want. If not, then it'd seem
you're arguing against the very concept of this, not the method of
interfacing with filesystems which support it already. 
While "Are streams/forks a good idea?" is a very interesting topic with
plenty of arguments both for and against, it isn't the topic at
hand.
