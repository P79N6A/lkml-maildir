I'll save you the trouble. I just checked myself and indeed the load is only 
1. What this means is that although there are 2 tasks running, only one is 
running at any time making a total load of 1. So, if we add two other tasks 
that add 2 more to the load the total load is 3. However if we weight the 
other two tasks at nice 5, they only add .75 each to the load making a 
weighted total of 2.5. This means that X+Gforce together should get a total 
of 1/2.5 or 40% of the overall cpu. That sounds like exactly what you're 
describing is happening.
