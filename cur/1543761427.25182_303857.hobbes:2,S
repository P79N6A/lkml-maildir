Yes indeed!

Correct.

Ummm. Big loads are our real-worldish workloads here.

I switched off the page-zeroing hardware for the tests.

Without zeroing hardware the eroing actions are moved to idle
system time (load < /proc/sys/vm/scrub_load). Its shifting the cpu load.
But I just fixed things up so that the kernel can return hot zeroed
pages to the pool for quicklist management. This yields zeroed pages
without kscrubd.
