One more question...
I had my Mouse working on my previous Linix,
but now I can't get anything except erratic movements.
I used >mouseconfig and specified 'MouseSystems'
and /dev/cua0 for Serial-port-1.
Also, I included ClearDTS and ClearRTS,
besides Protocol "MouseSystems" and Device "/dev/cua0"
in XF86Config.
What am I missing?
Do I need to disable GPM and how?
