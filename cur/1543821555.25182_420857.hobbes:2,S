No, I did not change the code in any way, it is exactly the version they 
mailed me. But I don't really understand what you are saying about the usbnet 
module. They gave me the sourcecode for a yet not available kernel module 
"mcs7830", not usbnet. Or did they just modify usbnet? I don't know enough 
about such things to distinguish from both.

I personally have the feeling that they didn't do this by purpose. They were 
very willing to help me with the driver and don't seem to understand much of 
kernel development. Anyway, if this IS a copyright violation, they should 
really change it quickly.

Sorry this isn't useful for me, I'm not a developer, more than ever no kernel 
developer. ;)

Maybe you should do this, since I don't know much about the details of GPL and 
my english is really bad. *g*

This is comprehensible. But, nevertheless this is the possibility of 
supporting another hardware device in linux, and we shouldn't forsake it.
