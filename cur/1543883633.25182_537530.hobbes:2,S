Subject: [PATCH 16/36] Use menuconfig objects II - MD
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/30/168

Change Kconfig objects from "menu, config" into "menuconfig" so
that the user can disable the whole feature without having to
enter the menu first.
