In this case why is this a module parameter at all ? If it doesn't
matter at all then it should get removed from all places.
In fact, I do think that all module parameter should be exposed in
/sys, and that a '0' in module_param() should really mean 0400.
It can be useful to know what parameters have been passed to a module,
and I cannot think of a single case where we want to hide this 
information (and no, security doesn't really apply here. If you have
root rights than you can also look into the kernel memory and find
out the value by yourself).
The only questions one should ask himself about a module parameter is
whether:
	- it is a R/O or a R/W value (and this is determined by
	  the code who uses this value, if it is dynamic then let
	  the parameter be R/W, if it's only used to make assumptions
	  in the init phase then it must be R/O).
	- it can be shown to everybody, or only root should be able
	  to read the value (0400 vs 0440/0444). I'm not sure this is
	  really useful since /etc/modprobe.conf is generaly 0644,
	  but it could be in some cases...
Stelian.
