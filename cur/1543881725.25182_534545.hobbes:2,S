The 'promise' is 'if you can get echo disk > /sys/power/state working,
uswsusp will work. too'. IOW it should be ok to debug the in-kernel
parts, only.
Even I am running in-kernel swsusp, but my managers were pretty clear
they want graphical progress bar hiding all the 'ugly' swsusp
messages... and in the end the same uswsusp enables compression, too.

Well, it is a bit more complex than that.
suspend-to-disk is a workaround for
	'suspend-to-ram eats too much power' (plus some details like
	being able to replace battery).
suspend-to-ram is a workaround for
	'idle machine takes way too much power' (plus some details
	like don't spin the disk so that machine is safe to carry).
I'm starting to think that we should fix the idle power consumption
problem. Cell phones do it right. They pretend to be ready/idle all
the time, yet they have _days_ of standby.
OLPC can do something like that, too: it is capable of entering
suspend-to-ram with screen on and input devices ready to wake the
system up.
And with right network card (and right userland) ... I think normal
PCs could enter suspend-to-ram during screensaver, too. When you are
about to turn off the screen, machine should enable WOL on any packet,
arm RTC wakeup for the next packet, and s2ram happily.
(Obviously we are far away from that on PC.)
