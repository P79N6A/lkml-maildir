There will be at least two new devices in the future, which again will 
need (at least) two new demod(and maybe tuner)-modules.
Prakash, if it is just the i2c_xfer failed, that could be easily turned 
into a debug-message, but I rather have these as errors, because they are.
I don't see the need for the ifdef - on the contrary: the number of people 
asking for which demod they shall load dropped significantly after 
FE_REFACTORING starting one year ago - now reintroducing that again is not 
a good idea, IMO.
best regards,
Patrick.
