No, with just this patch it still fails on pread02 and pwrite02.
# ./pread02
pread02     1  PASS  :  pread() fails, file descriptor is a PIPE or
FIFO, errno:29
pread02     2  FAIL  :  pread() returned 0, expected -1, errno:22
# ./pwrite02
pwrite02    1  PASS  :  file descriptor is a PIPE or FIFO, errno:29
caught SIGXFSZ
pwrite02    2  FAIL  :  specified offset is -ve or invalid, unexpected
errno:27, expected:22
pwrite02    3  PASS  :  file descriptor is bad, errno:9
