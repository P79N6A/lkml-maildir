That is not the point.  It is kernel bloat because it is
something that can be done in userland, and quite well in fact.
It can cause various problems as well if you're not careful.
Also, as stated it makes the code more difficult to maintain.
I'd like to see it go for all filesystems.  Userland tools can
deal with it.  The mount option does not remove the bloat from
the kernel.
