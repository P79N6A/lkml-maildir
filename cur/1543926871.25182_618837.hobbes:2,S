I finally got 2.6.24-rc2-mm1 working.  Andrew, how come those two
recent patches from Greg and Kay (the ones changing alloc_disk_node()  
and system_bus_init()) aren't in your hot-fixes directory?
There's still a problem.  During bootup I get this:
	floppy0: Floppy io-port 0x03f2 in use
That's not supposed to happen; the floppy disk should be working 
perfectly.  Is this a known problem?
Back to the main topic...  My system hibernates and resumes with no
apparent problem.  Jiri, it looks like you'll have to do some debug
tracing of the routines in drivers/base/power/main.c.
