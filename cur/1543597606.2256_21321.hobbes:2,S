More detailed report indicates that it is actually on ext2. Which would be
really really bad. It doesn't make the patch correct, but the patch might
be a starting point for some debugging session (ie instead of refusing to
merge them, print out the state of the overlapping buffers to see if there
is some pattern to it..)
