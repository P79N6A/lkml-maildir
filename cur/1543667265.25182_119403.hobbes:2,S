00:06.0 SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AIC-7880U
Onboard SCSI controller, MPS 1.4 enabled Intel 440 LX chipset (i.e. IRQ 
rerouting and stuff) Kernel is recompiled now (processor type change takes a 
while, for you need to recompile everything from scatch) to test the 
different IRQ settings, have dealt with problems like these before.
Note that I'm testing the official,plain Linus-2.5.65
