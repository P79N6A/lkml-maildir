I've been using Linux for about two years, and I'm a fairly competant C
programmer.  It's time for those two worlds to collide.  I have a question: 
When you hit ALT-F1,2,3,4,5,6 to switch consoles, is that handled by a routine
in the kernel, or an early-loaded userspace program?  If it's handled by the
kernel then where?  I've rgrep-ed a hole in my disk trying to find it.
The ultimate goal is to add a special ALT-F12 function, so finding the ALT-F?
handler would be very helpfull as an example.
Thanks,
