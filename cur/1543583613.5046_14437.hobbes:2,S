One data point on my hang -- I increased
/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_{max,default} from 64k to 256k, and then increased
/proc/sys/net/ipv5/tcp_wmem from "4096 16384 131072" to "16384 65536
262144", and the hangs seem to have either stopped or (more likely)
drastically reduced in frequency.  I was able to rsync a couple GB without
stalling.
I can perform more tests, if anyone has anything in particular that they'd
like to see.
