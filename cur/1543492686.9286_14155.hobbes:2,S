ksymoops reads the stack trace and code fragment straight from input,
in the order they are printed.  So it really depends on
arch/xxx/kernel/traps.c.  For ix86, stack is latest first, code is
printed from the EIP onwards.  Just to confuse the issue, some other
architectures print code either side of EIP, some even print code bytes
in words which have to be byte swapped to make any sense (see the -c
option in ksymoops/README).

First figure is offset within proc, second is length of proc.  By
default they are in hex but, because both gdb and klogd use decimal,
ksymoops has a -x toggle to switch between hex and decimal
offsets/lengths.

Deduction.  From the Oops decide which register is at fault.  Use gdb
to dissassemble the proc, see how that register got loaded.  Work out
which structure or passed variable is incorrect.  Then try to find out
how the bad value was created in the first place.  The last step is the
hardest.

You can get something like that with the Integrated Kernel Debugging
patch, 
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/patch-ikd-arca,
 current is
patch-ikd-arca-2.2.5.bz2.

The question of taking a kernel core dump has been been raised before
on Linux.  The big stumbling block has always been "can we trust the
I/O layer after an Oops?".  If the fault affects disk I/O then writing
to a kernel core file could easily corrupt your entire disk.  AFAIK,
nobody has though the benefit worth the risk.
