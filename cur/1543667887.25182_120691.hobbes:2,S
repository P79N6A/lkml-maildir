I'd like to keep the hash for all those addresses that aren't wildcards
and that aren't regexps -- we have fast, that is O(1) to O(log n),
access to the hash (depending on Perl's implementation) and we have
worse than O(n) for regexp, where n is the count of address strings or
regexps.
Would you agree to a version that has a set of fixed addresses and a
separate list of regexps, tries the hash first and then a list of
regexps?  That sounds like a) easy addition, b) good performance to me
(before implementing it). If so, I could add some code for that feature.
