Whatever. I've already told you why it's a dontcare. I'm basically
done with this thread until some actual memory usage numbers are
injected into it.

Not without at least a bit per-object of overhead. So you can either
fit 512 objects in 4160 bytes or 504 objects in 4k.

I've already explained this to you once tonight and there's only 8k of
code to read. It's also explained in the comment at the top:
 * SLAB is emulated on top of SLOB by simply calling constructors and
 * destructors for every SLAB allocation. Objects are returned with
 * the 8-byte alignment unless the SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN flag is
 * set, in which case the low-level allocator will fragment blocks to
 * create the proper alignment. Again, objects of page-size or greater
 * are allocated by calling __get_free_pages. As SLAB objects know
 * their size, no separate size bookkeeping is necessary and there is
 * essentially no allocation space overhead.
For the kmalloc case, we do have an 8-byte header, which works out to
be about 1/8th of the slop that mainline kmalloc over SLAB has on
average due to power of two cache sizes. So in both cases, less
overhead than SLAB and different-sized objects can be comingled. SLUB
would be awfully hard-pressed to have lower space overhead.
Compare:
void *kmem_cache_alloc(struct kmem_cache *c, gfp_t flags)
{
...
                b = slob_alloc(c->size, flags, c->align);
...
}
void kmem_cache_free(struct kmem_cache *c, void *b)
{
...
                slob_free(b, c->size);
...
}
vs.
void *__kmalloc(size_t size, gfp_t gfp)
{
...
                m = slob_alloc(size + SLOB_UNIT, gfp, 0);
                return m ? (void *)(m + 1) : 0;
...
}
void kfree(const void *block)
{
...
        slob_free((slob_t *)block - 1, 0);
...
}
