Is it okay to allow Hcold to lap Hhot?
In my understanding of CLOCK-Pro, such lapping causes sudden increase
in the distance between Hhot and Hcold.  As that distance is an
important parameter of page aging/replacement decisions, I'm afraid
that such lapping would result in incorrect page aging and bad
performance.
I guess the alternative is to advance Hhot together with Hcold, but
I'm not sure this is correct, either.
Please enlighten me.
