I found that each FS doesn't touch page->mapping so much as I expected.
(except for ReiserFS)
But ok, I admit changing this will confuse people.

Yes, if extra field in page struct is not hazard to push memory controller,
I don't have much motivation. 
Because extra 8 bytes makes page struct to be 64 bytes(in 64bit), extra 8 bytes
is the last space, I think.

There is a bit difference. My purpose is "avoid making struct page larger",
not "making struct page smaller".

 will conflict with my idea ?

Anyway, I'm not in hurry about this patch-set. I'll see what memory controller
will go. Other people seems to have an idea to implement 
pfn <-> container_info_per_page function.
(But this kind of function is not welcomed always.)
Thank you for comments.
