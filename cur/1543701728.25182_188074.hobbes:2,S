Good catch.  The module removal should refuse to remove it without --force.
I opened this hole when I dropped the sem around mod->init() (because
some modules load other modules in their init routine).
Andrew, please apply patch below.

No, it's OK.  We only care about the *total* being zero.
Thanks,

Name: Prevent Removal of Module During Init
Author: Rusty Russell
Status: Trivial
D: Vatsa spotted this: you can remove a module while it's being
D: initialized, and that will be bad.  Hole was opened when I dropped
D: the sem around the init routine (which can probe for other
D: modules).
