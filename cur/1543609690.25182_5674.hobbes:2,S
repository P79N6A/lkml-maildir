     I started by debugging this program where I was getting a segmentation fault.  I used gdb and traced the bug to a call instruction.  I dissasembled the code and stepped through the instructions.  The program  got a segmentation fault when it executed an assembly language call instruction. Using gdb I was able to disassemble the instructions at the called address. Why can gdb disasemble instructions at a call address and a call to that address fails with a segmentation fault?  Is this a kernel problem?  I am using kernel version 2.2.15.  Any suggestions would be appreciated. I tried kernel 2.4.4 and the same thing happens.  I have searched this mailing list archive and did find some posts about segmentation faults/ kernel bugs, but they did not resolve this problem.  I use egcs 1.1-2 and ld 2.9.5 versions.
