Well, I've taken the easy way out and simply used ditched ACPI, and
used APM support, which works just fine on IBM Thinkpads.  It would be
nice if ACPI worked, and every so often I put in a day or two worth of
futile frustration trying to improve ACPI support on my T40 laptop,
but with so many things being broken, and my only having limited
number of hours in the day, so it was much easier to simply fall back
ten yards and punt.
This is not a particularly satisfing solution for people who are stuck
with Dell or Sony laptops that don't have APM support, and who only
have ACPI, but this might have something to do with why I know a lot
of kernel developers who use IBM Thinkpads.  :-P
