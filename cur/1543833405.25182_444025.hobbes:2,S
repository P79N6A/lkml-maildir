You must honour throttle. That has always been the case. At all times
you should attempt to homour tty->receive_room and also ->throttle. If
you don't it breaks. There will always be some "reaction time" overruns.

Might be a good idea to put a limiter in before 2.6.18 proper just to
trap any other drivers that have that bug. At least printk a warning and
refuse the allocation once there is say 64K queued. That way the driver
author gets a hint all is not well.
