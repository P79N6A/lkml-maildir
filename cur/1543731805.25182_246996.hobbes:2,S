Argh, sorry about that.  My ignorance.

I'll fix this anyway - but, doesn't it make sense to change the
argument type to more reasonable one for 64bit architectures (as wli 
posted)?

Calling io_remap_page_range() in the PCM layer is provided only for
certain PCI drivers such as nm256, so disabling this isn't a problem
in general.  Indeed, this feature should be disabled for architectures
like sparc.
Or even better, as Russell King suggested before, we can hide
arch-specific things by creating a generic mmap method for struct
device.  I see that sparc already has pci_mmap_page_range() for a
similar purpose.

I'll try to set up.
