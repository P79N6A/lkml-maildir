And now I remember why I didn't go down that path earlier. Relayfs is one-way
kernel->user and lacks the ability to send query commands from user space
that we need. Either we would need to send commands up through a separate interface
(even a syscall) or try and ensure that the exiting genetlink interface can
scale better with message volume (including throttling).
