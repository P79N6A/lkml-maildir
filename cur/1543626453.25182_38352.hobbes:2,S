No.
I've only submitted the 2.4.x backport to Marcelo, and the only reason
I've export it as _GPL there is that it is _GPL in 2.5.x.  Having that
symbol without _GPL in 2.4 and with _GPL in 2.5 would be very bad style
and would upset people who start using that function in 2.4 and notice
later on that it is exported more strict in 2.5 ...
I'll happily submit a patch to Marcelo to remove the _GPL once it is
gone in Linus 2.5 tree.
The 2.5.x code (which I grabbed for the backport) was submitted by Ingo
and updated by Linus says my BK tree changelog.  Ingo obviously did
*not* a simple cut&paste of DaveM's code from bttv.  The 2.5.x
vmalloc_to_page() function handles pte-highmem and preemtable kernels,
that code was never in bttv.

Ingo is happy with removing _GPL, Linus too, where exactly is the
problem?
