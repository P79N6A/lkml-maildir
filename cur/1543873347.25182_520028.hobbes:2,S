The problem is the BIOS is busted on these machines. How much effort
do we want to put into dealing with systems with broken BIOS?
I would rather have the root cause fixed than creating a bandaid that
has to be maintained for all the other architectures and platforms.
What if the device with the IRQ problem is never loaded? Sometimes
devices aren't loaded until after boot.
If you use MSI interrupts, they aren't shared so there isn't a problem.
Maybe the root cause of this is bad MSI emulation handling in BIOS.
Any change like this has to be done without changing device drivers.
Changing the skge/sky2 drivers as special case is not acceptable.
