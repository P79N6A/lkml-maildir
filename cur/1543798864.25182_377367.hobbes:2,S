Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Uml: basic fixups for 2.6.15
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/18/58

These are some important fixes for 2.6.15 to merge. A couple of them are
already in -mm, but I'm resending them anyway since they haven't been merged,
and since akpm is "non-functional". They are:
uml-arch-um-scripts-makefilerules-remove-duplicated-code.patch
uml-fix-dynamic-linking-on-some-64-bit-distros.patch

Inform me of my mistakes, so I can keep imitating Homer Simpson's "Doh!".
