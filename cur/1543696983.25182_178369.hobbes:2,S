I had no idea but it is still a huge improvement over my HP 755MHz
Celleron that I am replacing ;) Might I as why so and am I wasting my
time when a non-SMP kernel builds and works just fine?

Hmm... Let's have a look. I started by loading the
kernel-2.4.20-i686-smp.config file that came with the RH9 distro into
xconfig. I just turned on ntfs and a couple of other things and saved.
The comparision is strange. My new config file has:
# CONFIG_ACPI is not set
however the RH9 config file has:
# CONFIG_ACPI is not set
# CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG is not set
# CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI is not set
# CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY is not s
CONFIG_ACPI_BUSMGR=m
CONFIG_ACPI_SYS=m
CONFIG_ACPI_CPU=m
CONFIG_ACPI_BUTTON=m
CONFIG_ACPI_AC=m
CONFIG_ACPI_EC=m
CONFIG_ACPI_CMBATT=m
CONFIG_ACPI_THERMAL=m
CONFIG_ACPI_RELAXED_AML=y
So should I have all this or no?

Rgr. I got this.

It does boot and everything else "seems" fine. Just that I still only
get one virtual CPU showing up in /proc/cpuinfo.

I still don't understand. So am I wasting my time with HT?
Thanks,
