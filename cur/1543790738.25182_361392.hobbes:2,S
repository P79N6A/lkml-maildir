Looks right to me.  exit_signal really could use a comment explaining that
the error path is the only place it gets called, or perhaps it would be
cleaner just to do away with it and have do_fork do that work directly in
its error path (i.e. at bad_fork_cleanup_signal: label).  It's less than
obvious when we have the inc in fork.c, the normal case dec in exit.c, and
the error path dec in signal.c.  The following is the same as Oleg's except
for this cosmetic cleanup.
Thanks,
Roland

    Fix signal->live leak in copy_process
    
    Oleg Nesterov pointed out that ->signal->live will be incremented and then
    never decremented in certain error paths out of do_fork, leading to leaks
    when cleanup is never done after the last thread in the group dies.
    
    This patch fixes that with a bit of cleanup.  The only caller of
    exit_signal was in this error path.  I've removed that function and moved
    its replacement into fork.c, so the decrement and the increment are done in
    the same source file where it's easier to follow what's going on.
