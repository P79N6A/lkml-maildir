Yes, I already understood this, the easy part.

Ok, I didn't imagine this (looks reasonable though).
Apart the fact that the "race with truncate" check is a bit different: this is 
is in __set_page_dirty_nobuffers(mm/page-writeback.c) and probably wants 
being added to the _buffers version, since it does cannot do anything else 
than triggering a BUG (which you don't see currently, I guess):
[...]
                        mapping2 = page_mapping(page);
                        if (mapping2) { /* Race with truncate? */
                                BUG_ON(mapping2 != mapping);
[...]

It can compile without 
#include <linux/buffer_head.h>
(even if the include is there), and it never seem to set any page as buffer 
(by setting the PG_private bit, which can have other meanings too I guess in 
other contexts).
So I guessed this right the first time - I was not sure if it was so 
straightforward.

If it is a speedup only, then I'm happier - I was especially worried if it was 
going to create possible bugs, even because there are someone has reported 
problems in listing large folders... never reproduced it here and most users 
don't see it, so not yet any clues.
Thanks a lot for the help!
