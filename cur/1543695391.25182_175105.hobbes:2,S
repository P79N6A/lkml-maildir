kjournald is wait for the current pending transaction to stop.

That is right.

This guy is waiting the journal commit to be finished, seems harmless
to me.

That seems wrong to me. It should get the lock before it start the
transasction. For the same reason that you can't lock_page inside
journal transasction, it is a ranking error. BTW, it seems that
current bk tree, truncate still do lock_page inside journal
transasction.

That is right.

I think you want to put ext3_sync_dquot to be atomic on power failure.  
The journal handle can get from ext3_current_journal_handle, which
used by writepage etc.
