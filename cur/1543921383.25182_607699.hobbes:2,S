Hello.
Whenever I log into xfce with gdm my computer will freeze when i use 
reiserfs as my /home on 2.6.23-mm1. Logging into the VT works perfectly 
fine. Previously my system would crash when logging into the VT but the
make-reiserfs-stop-using-struct-file-for-internal.patch patch fixed the 
issue(and possibly introduced the issue I currently have). My system 
works perfectly fine using 2.6.23-rc6-mm1 and prior. /home is mounted 
with the following options: /dev/sda3 on /home type reiserfs 
(rw,nosuid,nodev,noatime,acl)
