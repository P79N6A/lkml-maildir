Make sure the boot-time floppy seek option is enabled in your BIOS. While
it shouldn't be necessary nowadays in theory, I've seen some
motherboard/(1.44MB 3.5") floppy drive combinations that require it to be
enabled for the floppy drive to work with any level of consistency.
Also, if a particular disk is acting really strange, try ejecting it,
reinserting it, and trying again.
Both of these pieces of advice apply to Windows as well as Linux, FWIW.
