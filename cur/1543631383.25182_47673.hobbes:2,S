That's not a productive approach, Martin.
Yes, with open source you can do whatever you want.
HOWEVER, there is a huge amount of advantage to having a common base that 
is big enough to matter: why do you think MS does well commercially? 
It's important to _not_ have to force people to do site-specific (or 
problem-specific) hacks, even if they could do so. Because having to have 
site-specific hacks detracts from the general usability of the code.
So when simplifying, it's not just important to say "we could do without 
this". You have to also say "and nobody can reasonably expect to need it".
Which doesn't seem to be the case with /dev/ports. So it stays.
