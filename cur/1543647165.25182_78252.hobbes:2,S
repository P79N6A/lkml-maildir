-emm. Maybe he needs just a bit more. There's s book by Richard A.
Burgess, "Developing your own 32-bit Operating System". Howard W Sams.
ISBN 0-672-30655-7. It comes with a CDROM and a small OS that works.
In fact, it seems that a well-known, expensive 32-bit OS used by a
lot of the embedded companies is is DIRECT COPY of this! In many
procedures they didn't even change the variable names. The only thing
they did was... oh well I don't want to get sued ... 
Cheers,
