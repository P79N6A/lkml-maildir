I still haven't seen anything that might get us a
"universally correct" balancing between swap_out()
and refill_inactive_scan().
We either scan both categories at the same relative
rate, which gives mapped pages an advantage because
they may get unmapped later than the unmapped pages
get deactivated.
Alternatively, you do the scanning between these two
at different rates, which gives an advantage to one
or the other.
(or am I overlooking something stupid here?)

Rik
