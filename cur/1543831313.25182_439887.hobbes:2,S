Logical CPUs were just an artifact to get dense CPU maps, which is now
no longer necessary.  There are architectures which have never used
logical CPUs.  For them, the boot CPU is whatever the BIOS says it is.

That's not at all safe:  one of the standard times for CPUs to be
deconfigured is on boot.  It's really not a good idea to rely on finding
the same CPU back again to boot on.

The kernel has never had an abstraction requiring logical CPUs, let
alone one requiring that the boot CPU be numbered zero.
