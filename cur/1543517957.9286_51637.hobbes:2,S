part of the issue is that Linux inlines a lot of heavily-used kernel code.
but suppose gcc/ld could defer this inlining until link time?
in this case, module-load time.  compilers from at least HP and DEC have done
something like this; are there any efforts to do this kind of thing for gcc?
there would be major wins well beyond the kernel...
