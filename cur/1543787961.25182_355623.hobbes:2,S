Seems like gentoo has merged loop-AES' util-linux patch which has always
used better defaults.
Mainline util-linux compatible mount options for /etc/fstab
    encryption=twofish256,phash=unhashed2
Mainline util-linux compatible losetup command options
    losetup -e twofish256 -H unhashed2 ......
kerneli.org compatible mount options for /etc/fstab
    encryption=twofish256,phash=rmd160
kerneli.org compatible losetup command options
    losetup -e twofish256 -H rmd160 ......
mount and losetup programs don't enforce 20 character minimum passphrase
length when using 'rmd160' or 'unhashed2' hash functions.
Both mainline util-linux and kerneli.org compatible setups are broken
securitywise. If there still are file systems using such broken setups, now
is good time to re-encrypt them using stronger crypto.
