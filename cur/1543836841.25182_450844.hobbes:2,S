Well I've narroed it down to the following patch from Andrew:
x86_64-mm-early-param.patch
Basically, that leads setup_arch to return saved_command_line as _the_ 
command_line.  We then run parse_args() against it which assumes it may 
irrevocabaly change command_line.  Previous to this patch 
saved_command_line and command_line were separate and this was not an issue.
It feels like we should be following the model in the newly added 
parse_early_parms() and taking a local copy of the command_line here.
