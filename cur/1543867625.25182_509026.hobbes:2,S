So I think tonight I'll start adding try_to_freeze() to the kernel threads that
set PF_NOFREEZE.

Ah, thanks for the explanation.

Yes, but I think this is inevitable anyway, because we have moved the
disabling of nonboot CPUs after the suspending of devices (for
ACPI-related reasons).
Currently, we have, roughly:
freeze_processes();
shrink_memory(); (swsusp only)
suspend_devices();
disable_nonboot_cpus();
suspend
and the reverse during the resume.
Still, the second pass will be quick, since the majority of tasks are frozen
when disable_nonboot_cpus() is called.

No problem with that. ;-)
Speaking of the classification, do you think it would be practical to use
some kind of "freezing levels"?  I mean, for each task we can define the
"freezing level" at which it should be frozen and each user of the freezer
can call it with a specific "freezing level" as a parameter.  Of course for
this purpose the tasks frozen at level 1 have to be a subset of the tasks
frozen at level 2 etc. and I'm not sure if this requirement can be satisfied.
