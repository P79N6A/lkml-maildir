Hi,
I wrote an app that reads /proc/net/dev for net interface monitoring.
A user reported eth0 not working so I had him send me /proc/net/dev
contents.  He had this (cut down):
Inter-|   Receive                                                |  Transmit
 face |bytes    packets errs drop fifo frame compressed multicast|bytes    pa
    lo:   16205     187    0    0    0     0          0         0    16205
  eth0:       0   19346    0    2    0     0          0     12247        0
My question is, how can eth0 be reporting 0 bytes when obviously packet
traffic is occurring?  Is this something that can be affected by any
configuration program or was this a bug in 2.2.5?  His machine is
straight out of the box RedHat 6.0.
Thanks,
