This issue is fixed in 2.2.18 AFAIK (never seen it since).

Latest 2.2.19-pre has merged in Andrea's VM-global patch, which in my
experience makes life much easier on loaded servers. This patch is also
available as a 2.2.18-patch at
ftp://ftp
.<countrycode>.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/2.
2.18/VM-global-2.2.18pre25-7.bz2
(some mirrors lack this, so skipping the countrycode could be wise)
The latest 2.2.18 pre-version of this patch applied cleanly on my 2.2.18
final, and I've had no problems with it to date (as it's essentially the
same kernel, with just the version number bumped).
