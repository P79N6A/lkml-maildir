However, relatime has the POSIX behavior without the overhead. Therefore 
that (and maybe reldiratime?) are a far better choice. I don't see a big 
problem with some version of utils not supporting it, since it can be in 
the kernel and will be in the utils soon enough. We have lived without 
it this long, sounds as if we could live a bit longer.
