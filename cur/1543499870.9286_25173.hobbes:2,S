the lowlevel API from the kernel-internal pagecache to filesystems has
changed in an incompatible way in 2.3.7, to support the new pagecache and
to scale better on SMP. All 'not yet converted' filesystems break safely
at compilation time, instead of crashing and/or corrupting files. If you
still want to try 2.3.7 then you'll have compile a kernel with turned off
dosfs.
