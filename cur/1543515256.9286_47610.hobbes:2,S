Subject: 2.3.26: CONFIG_NTFS_FS & CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD problems

  A few problems with my typical kernel build:
    o	linux-2.3.26 (+CONFIG_NTFS_FS=y):
    	fs/filesystems.a(ntfs.o): In function `ntfs_statfs':
	ntfs.o(.text+0xc56): undefined reference to `__divdi3'
  This one is new since -2.3.25.
    o	linux-2.3.26 (+CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y):
	init/main.c:490: `memory_start' undeclared (first use in this function)
  This one started in -2.3.22 I believe.  Someone just posted a "fix"
for this one by deleting the whole #ifdef chunk, which can't be right.
  Disabling those two options lets me compile the kernel.
