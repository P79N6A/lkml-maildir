There are two options for AES cipher algorithms under
the Cryptographic API.  They read:
_ AES Cipher algorithms
_ AES Cipher algorithms (i586)
---
I assume(?) the i586 is for pentiums of some nature -- but is
that any machine pentium(i586) or "newer"(686, P4, Core2, Centrino?).
If both options are selected (mod or compiled in), will the
loading of the AES cipher automatically select the better choice?
Thanks,
Lin
