Hello Marcelo,
the system is up and running, currently:
  7:40pm  up 4 days  2:34,  21 users,  load average: 2.07, 2.10, 2.06
there is still the verification issue, today I added another 50 GB to the data
stream, and therefore got additional 3 verification  errors. But this seems to
have no influence on the stability. Box feels ok, reacts completely normal, no
strange output in any logs.
Regards,
Stephan
