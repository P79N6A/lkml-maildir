I've found it:
It's BIOS setting "USB legacy support", which I had on
"Auto" (default setting).
As soon as I disable "USB legacy support", system time
is now in sync with wall clock time!
root@setup:~ {508} $ ntpdate ntp.xss.co.at; sleep 60; ntpdate ntp.xss.co.at

 3 Jun 14:36:32 ntpdate[1146]: adjust time server 194.152.162.17 offset -0.002158 sec
Uaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!
Linux also now reports an interesting error on bootup, which
isn't there when booting with "USB legacy support=Auto"

..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
[...]
(This is 2.4.21-rc6-ac1 booting with "acpi=off")
What the hell does USB legacy support have to do with all this???
This is weird!
