It's unfortunate that Linus didn't want to accept the (admittedly)
large patch to bring 2.2 up to date with the development version,
and _does_ accept patches to the code from someone who apparently
didn't make much effort to communicate with the other isdn4linux
people.

It doesn't work with Cisco's?  Curious. I _know_ that isdn4linux
callback works fine with Ascends.
