A later patch in that series, "cpuidle: re-write", reverted
the documentation from the intermediate patch that you refer to:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git;a=commit;h=2305a5920fb8ee6ccec1c62ade05aa8351091d71
The cpuidle branch on git.kernel.org looks okay to me:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git;a=shortlog;h=cpuidle
the top commit is this one:
commit 8975059a2c1e56cfe83d1bcf031bcf4cb39be743

    CPUIDLE: load ACPI properly when CPUIDLE is disabled
And this top patch is indeed included in the latest acpi test branch,
as well as the latest ACPI test patch here:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/test/2.6.23/acpi-test-20070126-2.6.23-rc5.diff.gz
Note that there were some merge conflicts when pulling cpuidle into 2.6.23,
so you are best off running either the acpi patch above on top of 2.6.23-rc5,
or the acpi test  branch, or the mm tree so you won't have to merge the
cpuidle branch onto your latest kernel again.
cheers,
