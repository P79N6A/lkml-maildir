We definitely want that chipset to be on the whitelist.   It's used in
supermicro systems, the Mac systems with the 970 chip, and some large
vendor systems as well.
The detection of MSI not being enabled in the config space is 
a good thing to do (and warn about), of course, no problem with that.
I've seen no MSI-related issues with the ST2000 on 3 different
platforms, so far.
