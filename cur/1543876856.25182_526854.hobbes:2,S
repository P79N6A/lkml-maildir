It just leads to the problem ethernet has on BSD/Solaris/etc. You have
to ask yourself "is the ethernet on this system le0 or hme0 or maybe
something else entirely?" in this case. I agree it does solve the issue
of detection order breaking the configuration, but it is less than ideal.
I think the issue of the devices shuffling around is less likely to be
a problem on serial, although we don't have the nice uniqueness of
hardware identifiers that was used to do device renaming in ethernet.
I suppose my opinion on this shows that I didn't come from the x86
side of Linux. The breakdown on this argument seems to have always
been that the x86 people wanted 8250 to own ttyS* and most others
wanted it shared. I know it was that way when m68k tried to merge
in their serial framework that did allow such sharing across any
number of hardware drivers.
