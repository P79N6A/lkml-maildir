Yes. The DMA interface davem/et al introduce in linux-2.4 only
supported "PCI-Like" busses. Ie the API required struct pci_dev.

Besides 32-bit PCI devices, I expect legacy 24-bit E/ISA DMA will
need it.  Is ISA ~= PCI? I never got a clear answer on that.
I'm inclined to say it's not.
But since swiotlb complies with DMA-API interface and is not related
to any particular type of bus, I'd rather it go into lib/ instead of
drivers/pci.
