Funny, I was puzzling over this last night, before I looked at this
thread.
On my NEC VersSX notebook there does not seem to be a screen blank key
combination.  Instead, I had success with FN-F4 ("display") which
switches between external monitor, LCD, and both at once.  The LCD
screen can be blanked by switching to just the external monitor (even
if there isn't one).
Unfortunately, if X is running, the screen gets curdled into garbled
repeating columns.  Any idea what is going on?
What normally does screen blanking in non-X mode?  Can it be taught to
turn off the backlight (I don't think it does so now)?
On another topic, I find that the regular sync calls from update keep
my system from leaving the disk off for a reasonable amount of time
(at least I think that is what is going on). I suspect that if there
were an option to suppress inode flushing if the only change were to
the access time, these syncs would not actually require disk activity.
Is this guess right?  Is there a way to specify that sync should
behave this way?  Would it be easy to add?
