Hm, what's device_create_file(), device_remove_file(), and DEVICE_ATTR()
for?  A number of drivers use these functions today to add their own
driver specific attributes to a device they control.
Then, userspace can just do a simple:
	ls /sys/bus/pci/drivers/my_foo_driver/
to see all devices on the PCI bus that are controlled by that driver.
Then it can go into those directories and cat out the specific
information if needed.
Is there something that is lacking in the current code that you would
like to see present?  I don't think that adding another layer on top of
a device would help out much here.
thanks,
