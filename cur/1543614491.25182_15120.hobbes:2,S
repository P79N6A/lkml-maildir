I am having the following problem:
Sometimes, when my wife's laptop comes out of suspend mode, it causes my
nfs server to lock up hard -- I have to hit the reset button. Even after
I reset the server, it will just lock up again a few seconds after knfsd
starts, as long as the laptop is still on the net. If I suspend the
laptop, then start the server, it will start fine, and I can usually
unsuspend the laptop after that without problems. Up until yesterday,
there was never anything in the logs.
Yesterday, after the laptop unsuspended, the nfs service died. This time
however, the server itself didn't lock up, and this was in the kernel
log:

I couldn't restart nfsd and had to reboot the server, and of course it
locked up hard during reboot, and I had to suspend the laptop before I
could bring the server up.
The server is running 2.4.16 with XFS patches. The nfs-exported
directories are both xfs and rieserfs. The laptop runs kernel autofs,
and probably would have both of the server's xfs and reiserfs
filesystems mounted at suspend time, because Nautilus tends to keep some
filesystems permanently mounted.
The laptop is also running 2.4.16. Both systems are using the tulip.o
driver from 2.4.14, but the same problem was occurring when I had the
2.4.16 tulip driver on each system. 
I'm fairly certain that I saw this problem with 2.4.14 on the server as
well, but I don't recall for sure. The laptop's only been running linux
for a couple of weeks, so I can't say if this affected any older
kernels.
I will be happy to provide more information or do any special
troubleshooting for anyone who wants it.
