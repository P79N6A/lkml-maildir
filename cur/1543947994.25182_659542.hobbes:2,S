  Hmm, this patch is certainly safe from a kernel POV but changes a
behavior WRT userspace. Previously, user could do:
  quotaon /
  mount -o remount,ro /
  <be lucky>
  mount -o remount,rw /
  <have quotas still turned on>
  But with the patch, the quotas will be turned off. So I'm not sure
whether it's acceptable as a -stable thing...
