Hmm... I've tried using mutt/IMAP over GPRS connection, and I find it
extremely unpleasant, myself.  My solution is to use isync to provide
a local cached copy of the IMAP server on my laptop, and then run mutt
against the local cached copy.  
I have a patch to isync which allows it to issue multiple IMAP
commands in parallel (instead of operating in lockstep fashion):

With this patch, isync works very well, even over high latency, slow
speed links.
