As long as you make sure you save the LR in case you need it, you
can call asm functions. macros are _evil_ :)
Also, you can remove the code playing with BATs for now, they don't
really need to be saved. If the boot kernel sets them up any differently
than the saved kernel, we are in trouble anyway. And the G5 has no BATs.
