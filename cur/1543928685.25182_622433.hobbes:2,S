Part of your sentence seems to be missing, but I guess I understand your
point. How many files did you annotate this way? I can see it as being
useful to have the namespace explicit in each symbol, but doing it once
per module sounds like the 80% solution for 20% of the work, and the
two don't even conflict. In the current kernel, I count 12644 exported
symbols in 1646 files, in 540 directories.
One problem I can see with annotating every symbol is that it conflicts
with other patches that add more exported functions to a file without
adding the namespace, or that simply break because of context changes.
