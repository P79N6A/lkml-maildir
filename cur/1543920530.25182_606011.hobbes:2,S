Subject: [PATCH/RFA] sch_generic: fix carrier-on bug?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

While looking at a net driver with the following construct,
	if (!netif_carrier_ok(dev))
		netif_carrier_on(dev);
it stuck me that the netif_carrier_ok() check was redundant, since
netif_carrier_on() checks bit __LINK_STATE_NOCARRIER anyway.  This is
the same reason why netif_queue_stopped() need not be called prior to
netif_wake_queue().
This is true, but there is however an unwanted side effect from assuming
that netif_carrier_on() can be called multiple times:  it touches the
watchdog, regardless of pre-existing carrier state.
The fix:  move watchdog-up inside the bit-cleared code path.

This looks like an obvious bug fix to me, but I found it by reading code
rather than hitting it in the field.  Review appreciated.
