There are currently 2 files in the kernel tree that contain DOC:
sections.  These are not used in the docbooks, but you can see what
they look like here:
./drivers/net/3c501.c: * DOC: 3c501 Card Notes
./drivers/net/3c501.c: * DOC: Problems
./drivers/net/3c527.c: * DOC: Traps for the unwary
./drivers/net/3c527.c: * DOC: Theory Of Operation
./drivers/net/3c527.c: * DOC: Notes
Also, Johannes has patches to use DOC: in mac80211 files.
