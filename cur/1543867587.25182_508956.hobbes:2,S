Real stack looks to be:
 xfs_trans_cancel
 xfs_mkdir
 xfs_vn_mknod
 xfs_vn_mkdir
 vfs_mkdir
 sys_mkdirat
 sys_mkdir
We aborted a transaction for some reason. We got an error somewhere in
a mkdir while we had a dirty transaction.  Unfortunately, this tells us very
little about the error that actually caused the shutdown.
What is your filessytem layout? (xfs_info <mntpt>) How much memory
do you have and were you near enomem conditions?

Risky to run a production system on a filesystem that might be corrupted.
You risk further problems if you don't run repair....

So that's not a "new" filesystem at all...
FWIW, did you do any offline testing before you put it into production?

Can you describe your dm/md volume layout?

It might be. You didn't run xfs_check or xfs_repair, so we don't know if
there is any on disk corruption here.

If you want to know if you haven't left any landmines around for the
filesystem to trip over again. i.e. You should run repair after any
sort of XFS shutdown to make sure nothing is corrupted on disk.
If nothing is corrupted on disk, then we are looking at an in-memory
problem....

Not yet.

Yes. Do you have ECC memory on your server? Have you run memtest86?
Were there any I/O errors in the log prior to the shutdown message?
Cheers,
Dave.
