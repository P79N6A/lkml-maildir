All of these taken and will be incorporated in B3, but not in B2 going out
today

Will do. Please see the follow up question below

We did not want to use pci_alloc_consistent because it would give one page
even if we need 16 bytes (and we need a lot of these). Also, the
pci_poo_create and pci_pool_alloc would fail on some setups - maybe because
the driver requires lots of small chunks of DMAable buffers. So we decided
to write wrapper functions over pci_alloc_consistent..
