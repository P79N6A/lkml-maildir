  You can access tha disk via the bios, that is how the kernel in first
place can loaded.
Next we can make a kernel with initrd support. It gives the boot loader
(note not the kernel) the possibility to load a RAM disk (with bios
calls), which the kernel can mount as root. The kernel can then load
the required scsi driver as a module and then mount the real root fs
from disk.
