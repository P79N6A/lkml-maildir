Hm,
As this question arose may I ask where this timeout is configured ?
There is tcp_fin_timeout  configuration but I found nothing
corresponding to TIME_WAIT.
Here is how it bothers me.  On the Web sites using Apache/PHP and MySQL 
on different hosts I often see  "Sleep" connections hanging for many
minutes on MySQL hosts.    Tracking remote host and port shows this
connection is not assigned to any process on other end any more but
rather being in TIME_WAIT state. 
I do not care about TIME_WAIT  connection on client site itself, what
concerns me is, until connection is not fully closed server side does
not seems to be informed connection is dead and so  server resources are
not deallocated.    
Any ideas ?
