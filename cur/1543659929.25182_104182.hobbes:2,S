Subject: kswapd in D uninterruptible sleep on 2.4.21-pre3-ac2

I've got an SMP system running 2.4.21-pre3-ac2 with some odd behavior. 
 It's basically completely idle, but with a load average of 1.00, which 
I believe is due to "kswapd" being stuck in uninterruptible sleep:
040 D     0     7     1  0  75   0    -     0 down   ?        00:00:00 
kswapd
Can someone explain this behavior?
