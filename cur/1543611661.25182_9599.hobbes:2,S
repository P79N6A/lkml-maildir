I destroyed a  hard  disk  yesterday  with  2.4.16,  using  ext3.  A  heavy load
(compiling The gimp and several other things)  and everything came bad, symlinks
didn't work... (for exemple ln -s linux-2.4.17-pre2  linux did a link from linux
to linux either using linux-2.4.17-pre2 and /usr/src/linux-2.4.17-pre2.

I had only one partition mounted at the moment (/dev/hda1 on / type ext3)
Just in case : debian sid, gcc 2.95.4, everything up to date.
We're living in a dangerous world, since 2.4.10...
