Hmm. I read in my copy of ATA7:
 6.16.55 Words (103:100): Maximum user LBA for 48-bit Address feature set
 Words (103:100) contain a value that is one greater than the maximum LBA
 in user accessable space when the 48-bit Addressing feature set is supported.
 The maximum value that shall be placed in this field is 0000FFFFFFFFFFFFh.
 Support of these words is mandatory if the 48-bit Address feature set is supported.
Do you read differently?
