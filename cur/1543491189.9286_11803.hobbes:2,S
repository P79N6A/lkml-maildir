Hi all,
Disclaimer: My current contact with Linux is limited
 to reading this list and other internet sources. I
 will install and try the real thing when there is
 a release from one of the distributors.
D2: Swedish is my preferred language...
Quite a lot about the messages on this list are about
how to handle/optimize IO request and memory handling.
And related bugs...
There are several areas of interest:
- SCSI drivers
- SW-RAID drivers
- Huge file support (64 bit)
- Direct disk handling
- Optimal memory usage
- More threading, nice for SMP
- Media players and hold ups, due to read ahead and swap
  - - - (the list goes on forever)
Could it be time for a rewrite of the device handling
middle ware? (I have some ideas)
But before starting I think a summary of file usage
patterns and device types are in order... :-)
Please feel free to add patterns, correct notation...
File usage patterns	Example
-------------------------------------------
File access order patterns:
 sequential access	source code, multimedia during play
 random access		data bases, swap file
 reread after close	header files during compilation
File read/write patterns:
 read only		most system files, multimedia files
 read mostly (dominant)	source code
 write mostly		log files
 write only		/dev/null :-)
 read/write mix		swap file
File use frequency patterns:
 never			some yet to learn tool: vi (for me)
 infrequent		last projects document
 frequent		error sound :-(, current documents
File con currency patterns:
 one thread per file	application level read ahead
 single thread use	
 multi-thread use	threaded database? (find v. generate report)
 multi-program use	header files during parallel make
(more patterns?)
Other observations
 a file may exist on several devices	SW RAID
 a file might be a device		disc direct access!
 a device might be a file		encrypted disc
 programs may treat all files similar	tar, grep (sequential)
 usage patterns varies			server v. workstation
==============================================================
Device usage patterns	Examples
----------------------------------------------------------
Page access order:
 random access		RAM disks, Flash disks
 - - -
 strictly sequential	tape drives
IQ:
 dumb and lazy		CPU required to do everything (most old stuff)
 simple minded		one requests is handled, DMA
 smart			optimizes request orders, Scatter/Gather
Other observations:
 speed differences	like HD v. solid state HD -> different needs
 inter device depend.	using two EIDE devices on the same controller
 physical RAM		might be treated like a device!
Comments?
