Yes, that would also work, as I already mentioned (or tried to)
in one of my earlier comments. I would prefer to have this patch
though, because in the long term, I think we should migrate more
stuff away from the hash table and having the function there
means that others can use it as well.

This copies the correct data down to user space now, but might result
in returning an invalid error code.
In the second line you now have 'err != __put_user(...);', which is
a comparison, not an assignment!
For readability, I would simply write that as:
	ret = 0;
	if (put_user(sk->sk_stamp.tv_sec, &ctv->tv_sec) |
	    put_user(sk->sk_stamp.tv_usec, &ctv->tv_usec))
		err = -EFAULT;
You can also write it like your code, but with '|' instead of '!', but
that requires the additional knowledge that __put_user can only ever
return '0' or '-EFAULT' itself and that the bitwise or of those is
therefore also one of these two.
