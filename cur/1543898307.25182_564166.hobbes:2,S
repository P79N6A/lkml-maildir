It has been a total disaster from beginning to end.
It wastes power.
It hangs machines when it tries to blink.
To quote an earlier thread:
  "The driver uses panic_blink - something that we expect to work after 
   panic. It rapidly polls KBC status register to detect when it accepted 
   led command and does it without taking i8042_lock (because it may have 
   been taken before kernel panicked) so it is quite possible that that 
   interferes with atkbd operation."
and it has been confirmed to render unusable at least some thinkpads. I 
think it was Pavel who reported it last.

No, its main problem is that PEOPLE SHOULD NOT USE IT, but it sounds cool, 
so people end up configuring the damn thing even though they shouldn't.
Which is why I think it should be marked broken.
And yes, it *does* hurt people.
