So let the user set the background color too.  I find gray backgrounds
a mortal pain (the "standard" 75% gray of browsers, e.g., is a bad
compromise between pictures, which want 50% gray, and text, which wants
100% gray = white).
When I write HTML, my only concession to non-Strictness is a
"bgcolor='white'" attribute in every <body> start-tag.

There's no way to get it Good and Right for all, without more work
than you are willing to put in, following the hacker *mabla*-tradition
of basically ignoring UI/HF issues.
But it is still possible to make it Bad and Right, using such a hack as
described above.  What you have now is Good and Right for some and Bad
and Wrong for others, and the number of "others" can only grow --- no
matter how much you dink the colors in Brownian motion, responding to
random electromagnetic forces from randoms.

Don't say you weren't warned, nag, nag, nag, ...
My strategy here is to make sufficient fuss that you are motivated to
get off your duff to shut me up. :-) Better me than some irate
newbie who decides that configuring kernels "can make you blind, man".
And whilst you are implementing this, make sure a range of font sizes
is allowed in the X version.  My middle-aged eyes are more and more
happy with the "huge" setting in the xterm control-rightbutton menu,
especially on SuperVGA screen sizes.
