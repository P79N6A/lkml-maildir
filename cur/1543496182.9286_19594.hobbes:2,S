While preparing a patch for 2.3, I happened to notice that
mremap (if it moves the mapping changes the offset into whats mapped)!
It does this with got 2.2.9 & 2.0.32.
The fact that this hasn't shown up before amazes me.  The only
explanation I can think of this is both a linux specifc syscall
(so doesn't get used much) and only really useful for anonymous
pages (where the offset into the mapping doesn't matter anyway.
