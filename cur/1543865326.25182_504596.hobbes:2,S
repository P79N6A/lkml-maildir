Subject: [patch 23/59] SELinux: fix an oops with NetLabel and non-MLS SELinux policy
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From:  <paul.moore@hp.com>
In the case where a user has configured NetLabel in the kernel but is not
using a SELinux policy with the MLS/MCS feature enabled there is a bug in
mls_export_cat() where a NULL pointer is used.  The initial problem report and
discussion can be found here (this patch has been ACK'd by Stephen Smalley and
 James Morris in the discussion thread below):

http://marc2.theaimsgroup.com/?t=116920302500004&r=1&w=2
This patch is specific to the 2.6.19.y kernel series as the mls_export_cat()
function has been replaced in the 2.6.20 kernel.
