No, it does not help. If there is any difference, it is too small to be 
measured on
my system ... and my system does run at 1000 Hz.
After 2.6.12 fb_pad_aligned_buffer() was changed to use memcpy() instead 
of a
bytewise copy. That slowed things down a lot, some weeks ago that was 
reverted.
fb_pad_aligned _buffer() isn´t that slow, it´s just an external function 
to be called
and that means a lot of unnecessary code.
How could I make it an inline function? It is used in console/bitblit.c, 
nvidia/nvidia.c,
riva/fbdev.c and softcursor.c.
cu,
 Knut
