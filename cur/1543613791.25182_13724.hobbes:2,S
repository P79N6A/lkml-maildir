Yes, it's a VIA board. I thought, it could be depending on disk io. But 
I have the problem without havy disk io, too.
Another thing I suspect is the memory usage: If the memory (only RAM) is 
used at about one hundred percent, it seems to be more likely.
On the other hand, I can force the problem by doing some restarts of X 
directly after rebooting (about ten or twenty times). The memory usage 
is at this moment very low.

Andreas
