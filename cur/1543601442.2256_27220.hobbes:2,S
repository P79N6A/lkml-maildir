Ok, I just killed top. And it still is skiping lots although I do
not have any reniced jobs running. And yes, I had top running reniced
too on -pre10. I will boot -pre10 and check if it is skipping because
alsaplayer is currently skipping as hell (running make -j4 in the
background). Still no swap used. Strange. I will check xmms also and
let you know.
