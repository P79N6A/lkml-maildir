The argument is made that Linux could be improved by doing X. Not only do
we see Linux do better than another system using X, but we also can see a
simulation exercise that shows, X is worse in principle.

Are there really many such devices in use for non RT sorts of things?
What use do they have?

Isn't  problem here unfocused interrupts. If you are having lock contention,
speeding up locks is perhaps not the correct first approach.
