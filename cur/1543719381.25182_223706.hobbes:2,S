Oh, and another corner case. 
Say you have a cpu-bound process on an SMP box.
Say you're also using a large chunk of a CPU processing
interrupts from a single IRQ.
What stops the cpu-bound process being scheduled onto
the same CPU as the interrupt handlers?
Now you've got one idle CPU, and one seriously overloaded
CPU.
