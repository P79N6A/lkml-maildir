	I understand by this that you could not have, let's say, 60k
interrupts in Linux on a slower machine, which is interesting because we
have two systems here that handle about 60k interrupts/sec on average
(coming from two sources) and the system load is low.

	I've tried also with procinfo -D -n1 and there are about 30k
interrupts from each source.
