Feel free to profile it. I challenge you to find a real-life application
where the above is actually a performance problem.

The latter is something you can do with keyrings anyway. As for the
former, that too is completely solvable in userspace. For instance, CITI
has a scheme for issuing X509 proxy certificates given a kerberos key.
ssh can log you in automatically given the same kerberos key,...
This sort of problem is simply not a reason for sticking dsa into the
kernel.
