we should unexport it. Wakeups should be done via waitqueues - that way we
can do wakeup optimizations (eg. avoid taking the runqueue and waitqueue
lock if the waitqueue is empty) on the waitqueue level which are not done
at the wake_up_process level. It should be renamed to __wake_up_process()
rather. I understand the one-kernel-thread special case, but these
optimizations apply even in that case, and by using waitqueues the
multiple-kernel-threads case can be implemented much more easily.
plus, using wake_up_process on a thread pointer is not SMP-safe wrt.
module-removals - so only the 'in-kernel' kernel threads like bdflush
(which never exit) should use it.
