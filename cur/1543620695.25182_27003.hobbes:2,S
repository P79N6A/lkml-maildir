What's the difference here with "bk send"?
I have worked with a few BK patches in email, and I have to say that I
pretty much detest them. The less I have to work with them, the better,
although that may just because I don't yet have the same kind of
infrastructure for them as I have for regulat patches.
Making the infrastructure is not that hard, so if people start sending me
bk patches by email, I can improve it, and I'll probably not dislike bk
send as much as I do now.
(But _please_ do a "bk send" to a file, and edit the file before you send
it, instead of sending directly with that "Bitkeeper patch" subject line.
It looks like "bk send" was really designed for automatic merges, not for
humans)
