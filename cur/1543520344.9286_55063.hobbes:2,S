I've been cleaning it up and greatly increasing its capabilities over the
last few weeks.  I'll need real beta testers in a small number of weeks.
Please toss me some mail if you have a high volume site and are
willing to get your hands dirty.
yes, I fall into the camp that doesn't like khttpd, I'll happily admit it. 
We do not want httpd parsing in kernel space, full stop.  Ever looked at
what is required to be a full 1.1 implementation?  and yes, for true http
performance you do want 1.1's streaming and multiplexing and such, even if
its a pain. 
what we _do_ want is a nice API for doing async bulk file->file transfers.
Thats all the meat of khttpd really is.  We can get this with a bit of
thinking and proper async io.  This will happen in time.
I'll have more meat for people soon.
