The uhci-hcd driver _does_ restore the config space for its devices 
properly.

Just because the before and after values are different doesn't mean 
anything is wrong.  Those particular bits are set by the hardware in 
response to various events.  They are used only by the BIOS, to provide 
USB keyboard and mouse services.  They don't affect the device's function 
or the Linux driver at all.
