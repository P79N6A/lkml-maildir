set_pte is used even to mark the pte non present, so you can forget
about using BUG_ON(pte_present(*ptep)) anywhere in set_pte regardless of
how we fix this race (see mm/objrmap.c:unmap_pte_page()). If you want to
trap for it you should add a set_pte_present and use it at least in
objrmap.c during the paging.

unless you are generating page faults if the young bit is clear, this
will only slowdown compared to my simpler approch.
However if some arch is using page faults to set the young bit in
hardware (not in software), then slowing micro-down x86 and others might
be an option to share all the common code, but we could easily avoid
smp locking in x86 and alpha by threating the young-bit-page-fault archs
differently too. 
Would be nice to hear from the ia64 folks what they're doing w.r.t. to
the young bit, I think ia64 is the only one providing the young bit with
an hardware page fault.
