Umm... OK, I think that I can do it. Prerequisit: two new fields in
address_space that make sense by themselves:
	(i_size + PAGE_CACHE_SIZE - 1) >> PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT
	(i_size & ~PAGE_CACHE_MASK) ? : PAGE_CACHE_SIZE
Can we add it now? I mean the following: we have _very_ few places where
i_size is being changed. We could easily calculate these two expressions
at such points and put them into ->i_mapping. That kills quite a few long
long shifts (Good Thing, IMO) in places where we are using these values.
_If_ we can have it on that stage - devices in pagecache are trivial.
Frankly, I think that caching them makes sense regardless of
device-related stuff.
I can do the proof-of-concept patch (below 10Kb, ext2 + generic code, with
the need to repeat the fs-specific parts for other filesystems) in an
hour. Clearance?
Notice that said fields do _not_ replace i_size. They mirror it and allow
to
	* avoid costly recaclulation
	* have generic_file_read / filemap_nopage free from references to
inode->i_size, thus making them more usable for devices.
