To test the supposedly happy new buffer modifications, I typed the
following on my 96MB K6 233 box:
head -c128m /dev/zero > foo ; rm foo
While running "vmstat 1" in another console.  It looked pretty happy until
"rm" started to run -- it kept "rmming" forever, in fact.  vmstat showed a
solid ~850kb/sec being written out to disk (previously about 10MB/sec when
the file was being created), and it wouldn't stop.  The system was very
responsive, however -- logging in to a new console, etc, was all pretty
good.
I hit sysreq-e, sysreq-i, and it still kept going.  I hit sysreq-u
(unmount) and it _still_ kept going (!!!), even though sysreq-s said all
buffers were flushed multiple times.  A shift-scrolllock showed that there
were no dirty buffers after unmount, even though it was still going (not
100% sure on this).
Luckily it didn't seem to destroy anything, so I'm guessing it's stuck
somehow flushing out the same buffers over and over again.
I reproduced this twice on a clean 2.2.2pre4 tree.  It does not happen
with 2.2.1ac5 (includes pre2) or 2.2.1.
