"It's the latency, stupid". I wouldn't care to argue whether CVS is slower
than BK or not, but consider that if you had a router between you and the
CVS server that was dropping even 5% of your packets, or even just bumping
the latency by a quarter second (and I've seen routers that do that. evil
things), the timing numbers will jump *significantly*.
The best way to test network performance between the two protocols would be
to get yourself a good ol'fasioned serial cable and connect your test
client and test server to eachother via PPP at about ~9600bps or so, *then*
do your tests. Equal (though low) latency, equal (definatley low)
bandwidth, equal server and client performance.
Of course, all the CVS work I do is either over local 10/100 ethernet or
through my 6d/1uMbit cablemodem (which actually gets 6d/1u, up here in the
great white north), so what do I care? 8)
