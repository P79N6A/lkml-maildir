so if you power off your laptop the fan doesn't work when you turn it back 
on?????

given that we don't have a pure "shutdown" option available to try I don't 
see how this can be said to have been tested.
currently any attempts to do a shutdown type hibernate are tangled in the 
other code that is there for the suspend modes. this makes it _very_ hard 
to say that the hardware requires something as opposed to the strong 
possibility that the software is doing something wrong.
there are also a _lot_ of people who are not able to reliably use the 
existing "platform" mode hibernation, so it's not a fair statement to say 
that it's the 'right' thing to do. If you want to make it an option, fine. 
But please give those of us who don't care about these other wakeup 
options, and who want to be able to use other OS's while linux is stopped 
an option as well.
