There should never have been a return value from a function
called bcopy() anyway.

This whole thing is bogus. bcopy() is supposed to handle
copies of overlapping buffers (IEEE Std 1003.1-2001).
This means that if destination is at a greater offset than the
source, the data has to be copied backwards. The code above
is broken.
