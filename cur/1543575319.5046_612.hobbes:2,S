I had the exact same problem. Jumper-clipping doesn't work, so the 
solution to this problem is applying the IDE patch to the kernel 
(www.linux-ide.org), and then use IBM's Disk Manager utilities to 
software-clip the drive (don't set the jumper).
Software-clipping does exactly the same as hardware clipping, except that
a jumper isn't involved, and the drive can be clipped back to full 
capacity. Each drive has a flash memory is once you do it you don't have
to do it again.
