[... snip cpuinfo, dmesg, config ...]
Same problem with 2.6.23.8.
Are there any specific (TSC related?) patches I should try reverting?
Would it help if I captured the dmesg/SysRq output from one of the
hanging boots?
Any other information that might be useful in getting to the bottom of this?
Thanks.
