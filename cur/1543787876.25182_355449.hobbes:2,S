As has _always_ been the case in UNIX:  Provide capability,
not policy.
The more things are off loaded to userspace the better.
Look at it this way: the deadbolt on your house door does
not _eliminate_ the possibility of someone cleaning out
your house, even if you have a security system and/or
a guard dog.
Same thing here.
