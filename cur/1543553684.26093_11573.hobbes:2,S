I prefer a requirement that all net drivers upgrade to the new
interface, otherwise we have odd drivers using the old interface
forever and being at risk of module unload.  That is why I coded my
patch as returning -ENODEV if there was no dev->open.  However I have
to accept that just before a 2.4 release is not the best time to have a
flag day.  Put it down for 2.5.
