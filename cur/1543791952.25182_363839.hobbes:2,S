This is what I reported earlier and is the same behavior I am seeing on 
he 9500. I don't think its related
to the firmwae, but something in the driver because I can reproduce it 
on 8000 series controllers as well.
What's common between the two is it's on a 2.6.9 kernel with the 
drivers. Eventually, the init proceeds
and completes, but it's related to the INIT state not getting tripped 
into running.
