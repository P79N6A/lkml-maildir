Actually there is a lot more fishy here.  This code is duplicated over
every single architecture.  It uses a notifier chain that only ever has
one actual uaesr.  It exports interfaces that are potential harmful.
Please do the right thing to optimize this instead and rip out the brandead
notifier chain mechanisms and directly call into the krobes handler if
kprobes are active, in particular the DIE_PAGE_FAULT: case of 
kprobe_exceptions_notify.  That allows you to optimize the path both
if kprobes are active, and even further if they're not.
The same should be done for all other architectures, and the other
(ab-)uses of  the kprobes notifiers.
