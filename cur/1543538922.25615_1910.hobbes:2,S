I don't need the lock_kernel, but I considered that approach for the use 
count handling. I'll probably put it into my CVS tree but (try to) leave it 
out of the patches I send to Linus.
I already have a fairly large set of additions to compatmac.h - see 
mtd/compatmac.h 
...

Probably. But _only_ if the merge gets into 2.2.17 too - if not then I 
still need to keep my own copy, and there's no point in doing it.
