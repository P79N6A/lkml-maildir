	Then the kernel is broken. It must not block an operation indefinitely when
that operation can complete without blocking.
	It is, however, perfectly legal to say an operation can complete without
blocking (say, through 'select' or 'poll') and later return EWOULDBLOCK. (So
long as some operation could have completed, not necessarily the one you
tried.) Just as a 'poll may return that write is okay for a TCP connection
but a 64Kb write will definitely block.
