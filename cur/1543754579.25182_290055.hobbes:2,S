Not clear. I would expect the eMac to run with a fairly recent revision
of UniNorth with no issue, and since it's not an SMP machine there
should be no problem...
On the other hand, I also suspect that the whole NAP thing does have a
small impact on performances, so that may be the reason they chose not
to do it on this HW...
