Actually, the paging hardware makes 0/1/2 equivalent; some *other* 
primitives make 1/2/3 equivalent...

No doubt.  However, I wish they would have at least taken the few useful 
thing they had in the i286 botch, like the RPL, and made them available 
to the paging system.  That way i386 would have had "access this as from 
user space" like most architectures have.
