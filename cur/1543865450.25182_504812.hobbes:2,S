It's not a bug, there's no rational alternative. What would two indepedent
file descriptors for the same end of a TCP connection be? What happens when
you call 'dup' on a file descriptor? The behavior is both the only logical
behavior and consistent with other cases where a file descriptor is
split/duplicated.
