Hi
I've been looking at the fam and imon stuff at
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/
It seems to be something that can be quite useful.
Is thare a reason why this is not part of the kernel?
Is there an imon patch that can be used with the 2.4.10 kernels?
I looked at imon for the 2.4.0 kernel and it seem to be a set of new
files plus a patch to linux/fs/namei.c
namei.c has changed since the 2.4.0 kernel so the patch won't work. I
did try to isolate what need to be done and found that I could get it to
compile by adding an include of a header file. The problem is that doing
this seems to break the iptables stuff.
Any help appreciated
John
