   Please reconsider your opinion.  Both Sun and SGI scale past 100 CPUs on
   reasonable workloads in shared memory.  Where "reasonable" != easy to do.
Also consider that if you start having performed so badly in the
uniprocessor case like Solaris does, it doesn't take so much effort to
get good scalability percentages as you add cpus because there isn't
much to scale. :-)
To Sun's credit, they have on their side the fact that in the x86
world there still has never has been a very good large scale SMP
backplane as of yet.  At least not on the order of what you'd find
on one of Sun's big boxes.
But in the same breath this is what will kill Sun in the end.  Over
time, the commodity stuff inches closer and closer to what Sun's "high
end" is.
