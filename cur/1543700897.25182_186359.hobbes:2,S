Debian doesn't seem to have an alsa-lib exactly.
Package: libalsaplayer0
Versions: 
0.99.59-5(/var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.debian.org_debian_dists_stable_main_binary-i386_Packages)(/var/lib/dpkg/status)
(provides /usr/lib/libalsaplayer.so.0.0.1)
$ apt-cache showpkg alsaplayer-alsa     
Package: alsaplayer-alsa
Versions:

(provides /usr/lib/alsaplayer/output/libalsa.so)
