As of 1541 anyway (haven't tried anything newer, assuming newer exists), the 
make install of the nvidia driver also runs makedevices.sh (a vendor sp 
script that makes the devnodes. This may also have been put in the 
initscripts (mine isn't, but i tend to use the tar.gz fmt, not using the RPMs)
Perhaps there is no check for devfs (likely will be fixed in the next 
release, as this is a new situation)

<snip> AFAIK, the nvidia scipt does not make the devnodes persistent (if so, 
it's b0rken on my box)
