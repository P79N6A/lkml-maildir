That's just the point!  The hardware manufacturers are going to implement the
crypto so that only valid digitally signed files can be played on that hardware,
and there will be crypto at every step to try and prevent people from getting at

They want to keep us from doing cd/mp3 or DVD/DivX type conversions.
