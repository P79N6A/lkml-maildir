The harm is that stable release patches will eventually start being 
maintained and we'll have to add another stable release "dot" to the end 
of the growing width of the release version moniker. This stable branch 
was meant only for "one-off" fixes to a stable release, not for adding 
fixes upon fixes upon fixes that eventually turn into features that have 
to be maintained. A new stable release means we change our focus to it and 
ignore the old stable release.
