And I violently agree. But I also add the _other_ requirement:
 * I contend that user-visible behaviour of a mapping should be 100% the

Put the two together, and see what you get. You get the requirement that 
if MAP_SHARED works, then MAP_PRIVATE also has to work.
That's my requirement. Consistency.
