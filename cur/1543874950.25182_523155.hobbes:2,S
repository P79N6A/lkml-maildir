I have one comment :)

Unfortunatly this part is wrong.
You should check num_possible_nodes(), or nr_node_ids (this one is cheaper, 
its a variable instead of a function call)
I wonder if we could add a new SLAB_NUMA_BYPASS, so that we can declare some 
kmem_cache as non NUMA aware (for example, I feel network skb dont need the 
NUMA overhead)
