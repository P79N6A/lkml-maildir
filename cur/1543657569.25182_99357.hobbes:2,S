Found the problem, don't know how to fix it.  2.4.20 kernel.
The bad drive is returning "NOT READY" to sd.  According to this code in
scsi_lib.c/scsi_io_completion():
               if ((SCpnt->sense_buffer[0] & 0x7f) == 0x70) {
                        /*
                         * If the device is in the process of becoming ready,
                         * retry.
                         */
                        if (SCpnt->sense_buffer[12] == 0x04 &&
                            SCpnt->sense_buffer[13] == 0x01) {
                                scsi_queue_next_request(q, SCpnt);
                                return;
                        }
My sense is [0] = 0x70, [2] = 0x2 (not ready) [12] = 4 [13] = 1.
Unfortunately, the drive never becomes ready.  Therefore the request is
resubmitted, forever.  Therefore the sector read never returns success,
therefore you hang on read or write of a drive that returns NOT_READY
forever.  Therefore I'm hanging on the read of the partition table,
therefore my kernel won't start with a bad drive in the system.
2.2 behavior was different.  A not ready would be labeled as a SCSI error
and the failure to read was passed up through the layers.
Now, I could put that beahavior back, where a NOT_READY is a fatal error,
but I'm afraid to screw up other situations where NOT_READY means you
should wait a little longer. (hot plug, removables, etc?)
What is the correct behavior that I should implement?
a.  if !removable && not ready then error
b.  if not ready then increase count until threshold then error
c   if not ready then error
d.  none of the above
Thanks!
