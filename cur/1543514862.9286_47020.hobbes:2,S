What exactly is it that ioremap() returns?

This would be part of the problem I mentioned.
It also totally destroys Alan Cox's and other peoples statements in the past
about Linux being faster than something like UDI because it doesn't have to
go through a routine just to access the bus.

I/O space as in marked as I/O in the PCI configuration registers. I think

I thought they got rid of that sparse addressing junk. It was always a
kludge to work around lack of a true access of less than one word.

Check a more recent copy of the file.
Documentation/pci.txt does state that the old pcibios functions are
depreciated. It also includes warning about having to use the values from
struct pci_dev for ioremap(), although the description could be improved.
In rereading it, I see that the IO-mapping.txt file does mention that you
need to use the readl/w/b and writel/w/b functions. This statement really
needs to be added to section 4 of the pci.txt file, since most of the
documentation is talking about things needed for PCI DMA masters.
I'm really getting to dislike Linux because of this kind of stuff. 
It is no surprise to me that many of the drivers don't do things correctly,
considering how tough it is to determine what correct is.
