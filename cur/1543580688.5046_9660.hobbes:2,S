I think I'm starting to get a hold on this.  Can you do a test
for me?
Write a small test program, similar to your TCP one, which instead
uses UDP and let me know what FreeBSD and Solaris do in that case.
Of course, skip the listen part.
I think the test for port reuse in tcp_{v4,v6}_get_port is buggy.
I'll go study this and fix it up... but please do the test I asked
anyways.
