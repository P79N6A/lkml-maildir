: But those were just done under SunOS, right? I wonder whether your
: results reflect that tarfs is a very good idea, or that SunOS is
: slow. This reminds me of the recurrent "let's implement swapfs for
: Linux" thread. Swapfs is good for SunOS because SunOS is slow. Swapfs
: for Linux is probably pointless because ext2fs and Linux are so fast.
Do the math.  If you did the math, instead of asking me to do the math,
then you would already know the answer.  I find this whole conversation
extremely frustrating.  Nothing I tell you is good enough and when I
tell you to go reason it out and come up with the same (or different,
I could care less which) answers on your own, you come back and ask
me to tell you again what I've already told you.  That's an endless
loop and only you can break out of it - go think about it.  Model it.
Figure out exactly how long it takes to read a bunch of little files
all in their own blocks and contrast that with how long it would take
to read all those blocks in one large I/O.
I can't think for you.  Please think for yourself and then we can have
a reasonable (and very enjoyable, I might add) conversation.
