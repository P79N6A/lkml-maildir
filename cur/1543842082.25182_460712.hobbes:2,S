yes ext3_get_blocks_handle() will return the number of data blocks 
allocated(not including the indirect/double indirecto blocks), and that 
number should not than maxblocks. In this case, it should return 1 instead.
The ext3_get_blocks_handle() behavior was changed when multiple blocks 
map/allocation was added to ext3 via this function. Previously, the 
behavior of ext3_get_blokc_handle() returns 0 for success case, and 
returns non-zero(nagive) for error case. While with new behavior, the 
success case is the thre returned value should > 0.
How many blocks is being mapped in this case? > 1? or 0? If it failed to 
map the block (ext3_get_blocks_handle() returns 0), ext3_getblk() will 
also WARN_ON().
