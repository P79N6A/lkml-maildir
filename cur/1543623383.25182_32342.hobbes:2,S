Yes, but no allocation is even better than on-demand allocation, if you can
get away with it.

Well, it's pretty easy to allow other values than -1/1 later as required.
I don't think the switch() overhead will be measurable for the first dozen
lock types 8).

Sorry, my bad.  I use -EINTR, so they don't get restarted, for exactly that
reason (eg. implementing timeouts on mutexes).
Cheers!
