It looks like 2.6.13-rc4-mm1 is fine and dandy on two of AMD64 boxes I have
access to.  In particular, all of the problems that I've had recently with Asus L5D
seem to be gone now. :-))
I only had a problem with this kernel on a NUMA-enabled dual-Opteron box,
which hanged solid when I started to copy huge amounts of data from it over
the network.  If I'm able to reproduce it, I'll investigate it a bit more and let you
know.
Greets,
Rafael
