Hello,
I'm a bit puzzled because vdso doesn't seem to be used on my fedora 7:
I just compiled a trivial program which just call gettimeofday() and
ld.so resolves this call with vsyscall's gettimeofday.
Now I'm wondering when vdso is used, could anybody give me a clue ?
Another question: is vdso going to replace vsyscall at all ? If so how
are statically programs going to be handled ?
Thanks,
