This looks like a high-level thing to me.
Ideally something like ansi escape sequences to switch between
left-to-right, right-to-left, and up-to-down advancing of
the cursor.  Then the same multilingual apps will work with
fbdev, xterm, and other terminals and emulators that
implement those operations.
