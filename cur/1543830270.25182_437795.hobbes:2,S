Y'all,
I have had a look at the changes to the 2.6.1{6,7} kernel to do with the 
buffering and I think that this driver will benefit greatly from the 
changes away from the flip/flop scheme.
When Steve and I originally wrote the driver it always seemed to be 
limited throughput wise, due to the inefficient char handling it did.
Good luck in the 'hacking it for 2.6.1{6,7} department' let me know if I 
can help at all :)
BTW: Can someone tell me the version that you are changing - I may have 
a later version that fixes a problem with the V2 PCMCIA cards from 
IPWireless/T-Mobile.
