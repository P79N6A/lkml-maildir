Abuse is a possible problem but you can deal with that. If you don't
inherit endian changes then the problem doesn't occur. If you must
inherit them then drop the inheritance when an suid/sgid exec occurs as
we do with some other properties.
Can you explain however why you can't do this simply by using a binary
magic number in the executable to indicate which endian it is, or do you
really need to flip it ?
