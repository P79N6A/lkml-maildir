I plan to do something much like that.  An auxiliary streaming channel
is required for things like dial/busy tone detection, because I've found
(non-RT) user space scheduling isn't fine grained enough for simple "is
there a tone now?" questions to distinguish different patterns.  At
least, according to certain country-specific parameters.

Of course ;-)
