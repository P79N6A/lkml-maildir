OK, in some contexts, sure. Larry wrote, for example:

But so what? That's $16 worth of DRAM (I just checked). Not so bad 
*if* threads are otherwise a great solution. I grant that one might 
have a pretty tough time making the case, but again, for the right 
application, say some app with a dedicated server, 73MB isn't the end 
of the world (though I suppose it was at the time...).
Regardless, these discussions tend to end up sounding like (in this 
case) "use threads for everything" vs "never ever use threads", 
neither of which is likely to fairly represent the views of the 
participants. Threads have their place, they can be misused, and 
overusing resources is only one of the possible ways to misuse them.
