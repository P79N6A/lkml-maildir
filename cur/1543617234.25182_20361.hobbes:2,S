It is wokring fine for me, under 2.4.18-pre3 + NVidia. The difference is
that I am using version 0.7.87 (see 
http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~magallon/linux/2.4.18-pre3/
)
I have just checked the bttv page (
http://bytesex.org/bttv/
) and there is
a newer version (0.7.88). What comes in .17 is 0.7.83. I have not
noticed anything relevant in changelog, but you can try...
