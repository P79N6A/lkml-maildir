hello,
a few days ago I replaced my old MB by a QDI Advance 10F-board (VT82C694X 
+ VT82C686B). Since that time I am running into trouble when writing on my 
IDE-Floppy (/dev/hdb), read-access is ok, all other IDE-devices are working 
fine.
/var/log/messages reports:
cosanostra kernel: hdb: ATAPI reset complete
Jun 20 14:45:29 cosanostra kernel: hdb: lost interrupt
Jun 20 14:45:29 cosanostra kernel: ide-floppy: CoD != 0 in idefloppy_pc_intr
These problems occurr running 2.4.5-ac15 as well as W98. QDI seems to know 
about this problem because they recommend to upgrade to the latest 
VIA-chipset-drivers, which did not help (W98). At this point I am not sure 
wether the "ide-floppy"-issue is MB-specific or chipset-related. Could anyone 
familiar with the VIA-chipset-driver comment on that, maybe its a 
development-aspect for the via-driver ?
Thanks in advance
