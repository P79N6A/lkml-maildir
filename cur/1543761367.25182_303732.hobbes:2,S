On laptops, 25-pin ports tend to be parallel, rather than serial. At
least, that's my experience.

Hook a printer up to the 25-pin port (the other end of the cable will
most likely have 36 pins), then use (I think, it's been a while)
/dev/lp0 as your console device, rather than /dev/ttyS#. This assumes
that your kernel has parallel console support compiled in, and that
the parallel port support is compiled in (as opposed to being a module).
And if you do the above, make sure to have lots of paper handy. Also,
this trick probably won't work with all printers, but it stands a good
chance of working.
