I had sent a private mail to davidm for inclusion in ia64 tree, he mentioned 
that it would be preferable to cook akpm tree to make sure no build breaks, 
and then he would consider those for inclusion in his tree. especially -mm gets
more testing, but iam not sure how may would really try this hotplug :-)
anytime now seems appropriate...
until David pickup's these it would be great to leave the here for anyone 
interested in testing...
Cheers,
Ashok
