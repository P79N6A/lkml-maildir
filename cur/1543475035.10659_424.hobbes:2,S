Hi, I've search the kernel archive and I can't seem to come up with any 
answers to this problem.  If I do cat sound.au > /dev/audio it sounds find,
but if I do dd if=sound.au of=/dev/audio it doesn't sound right.  It sounds
as if it's been over amplified - very harsh and loud. dd worked just fine 
for me in 2.0.36.  I even upgraded dd from 3.12 to 4.0, it didn't help.
I have a true Sound Blaster 16 (CT1440 I think).  Please CC me any replies,
I'm not on the list.  Thanks for any help.
