I want to read from serial port (I mean the port, which is called
/dev/ttyS0 in user-space). Then I want copy_to_user() it through
/proc/serialPort
This is just to get familiar with driver programming (in kernelspace),
it could be better done in userspace - I know. But this is for learning.
It is a kind of synthetic problem, but after this, I hope too know how
to handle further ones.
Understood? It is a little bit strange, but hope it is explained well. ;)
If tell me that for /dev/ttyS0 I can adept it to /dev/ttyS1 etc..
thx
