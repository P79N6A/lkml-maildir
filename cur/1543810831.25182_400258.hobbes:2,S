Following your advice, I've set CONFIG_ACPI, and now, isolcpus works
fine, when hyperthreading is activated.
But, I'm trying to build a real time system where hyperthreading is not
desired. So, I've tried to disable HT in BIOS, and the result is the
same as when ACPI is not enabled in kernel config: isolated cpu is
always cpu0.
On the same machine, which is originally a Scientific Linux 4, I've
tried with distribution supplied kernel (a customized 2.6.9 with smp/HT
enabled): isolcpus works fine, even with HT disabled at BIOS level.
It seems there's a regression between 2.6.9 and 2.6.15. 
I've attached config file of scientific linux 4.
