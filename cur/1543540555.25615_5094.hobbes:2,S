David, all,
  Just noticed this.
  getblk() (fs/buffer.c) can now be called without the BLK being held.
  After searching the hash table (get_hash_table()), a free buffer-head
can be claimed off the freelist and inserted into the hash-table without
re-checking the hash-table (the hash-table lock is dropped between the
original search and new insert).  This gives serious problems on SMP.
