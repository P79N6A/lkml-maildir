The first important point here is that vger rejects mail in SMTP
DATA phase, thus making the forgery irrelevant WRT such bounces.
Second, being on the list isn't enough for the message to go
through, it has to pass the filters as everyone else.
Third, while I think "normal" autoresponders (vacation etc.)
are perfectly reasonable (not in mailing list context of course),
ones which by design respond mostly to forged addresses (do you
think antivirus and antispam qualify?) are aimed at the wrong,
innocent person.
