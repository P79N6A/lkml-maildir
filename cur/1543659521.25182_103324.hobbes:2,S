Hello all,
    I'm a computer science grad student, and I would
like to know some suggestions about links, docs and
books to start study the kernel linux, if wouldn't
bother anyone.
    I like assembly a lot too. Is there some good
place to work with assembly in Linux that is very
applicable ?
  Thanks a lot
