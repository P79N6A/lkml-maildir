   Sparse superblocks can be turn on/off by the current tune2fs.
   You follow it by a fsck to clean up, then it's done.
   I was hoping they'd speed up the mount but its still takes an age...
Until I get the patch in, just do "mount -o check=none"; it's what I've
been doing forever,
   Why does 4k blocksize check faster?  (I've never tried it).  Does it use
   fewer superblocks?
The indirect blocks are bigger, so a single indirect block can hold more
block numbers; futhermore, each block is bigger, so the number of
indirect blocks needed goes down by a factor of 16.

   And much more waste. I recently discovered that a ~5GB 4K ext2 source 
   code partition has ~480MB wasted in file tails. The same fileset
   (about 192k files) would only waste ~108MB with 1K blocks.
It depends on what you're putting in the filesystem.  If it's mostly
smallish files. such as you might expect on a source partition, then the
fragmentation overhead is much more of an issue; a 1k block size is
probably more appropriate.  But if you have a filesystem with really
large files, then a 4k blocksize is really what you want.
