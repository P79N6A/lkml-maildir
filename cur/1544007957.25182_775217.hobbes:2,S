Subject: [PATCH 0/8] badpage: more resilient bad page pte and rmap
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Here's a batch of 8 mm patches, intended for 2.6.29: revisiting
bad_page() and print_bad_pte() and the page_remove_rmap() Eeek BUG.
Diffed to slot in to the mmotm series just before "mmend".
The only clash with later mmotm patches is with Manfred's
mm-debug-dump-pageframes-on-bad_page.patch
which puts a hexdump in there.  Trivial to fix up, but I've never
actually found that patch helpful - perhaps because it isn't an -mm
tree that "Bad page state" reporters are running.  Time to drop it?
