  There is another solution.  And that is never allocate memory unless
you have swap space.  Yes, the issue is that you need to have lots of
disk allocated to swap but on a big machine you will have that space.
  This way the offending process that asks for more memory will be
the one that gets killed.  Even if the 1st couple of ones aren't the
misbehaving process eventually it will ask for more memory and suffer
process execution.  
  Of course you don't allocate swap every time somebody asks for
a byte but you do it on some big boundary and do it when somebody
crosses that line.
