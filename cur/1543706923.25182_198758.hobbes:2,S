Do you use ECC memory, is ECC enabled in the BIOS [and does it work - 
some vendors lie about ECC support]?
I would bet that it's a soft memory error: 00000000 means not used. One 
bit differs, and the kernel complains about the invalid value. I think 
the following oops is a side effect of the bad swap entry.
Do you have timestaps in the system log? Is the swap error just before 
the BUG in buffer.c?
