	Nope, it was question of 0.5G mailer spool filling with
	a flood of about 5MB error messages ...
	Setting input message size limit to 1 MB, and killing all
	spooled message files which size exceeded 1MB did get us
	out of the tight spot..
	As a result, you can't send thru VGER any message which size
	exceeds that 1MB -- not that you would want to, either..
	Digests may grow up to 100 kB, most messages are under 5 kB
	in size.
