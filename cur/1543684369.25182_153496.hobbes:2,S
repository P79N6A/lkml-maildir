Yes, I assume that need_resched() is always false because kernel preemption
cuts in first.  Can you please confirm that you're using CONFIG_PREEMPT,
and that the problem goes away if CONFIG_PREEMPT is disabled?
The problem which you identify will also invalidate the idle_timestamp
instrumentation so I think we should move that inside as well.
