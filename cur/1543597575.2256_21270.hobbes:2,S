DocBook is more "bookish" complete with chapters and all.  I've used it 
before, it's nice, but not for this, in my opinion.  Also, the backend just 
moves the XML data into a temporary MySQL database for easy searching, and 
sorting, and something like that, I think, would be much more difficult with 
docbook.
