Subject: netdump netpoll bug?

Every time my system panics and  my client is dumping the vmcore to
the netdump-server, I get error "netpoll_start_netdump: called
recursively. rebooting". and my client reboots. And I get a
vmcore-incomplete file. I did a fresh install of Linux RHEL4-WS and
still get the same problem. Any ideas how to proceed?
google search for "netpoll_start_netdump" .. "netdump bug recursively"
etc dint return any perceivable results.. any leads would be
appreciated..
also if this is the wrong place to post, I would appriciate it if i
coudl know the right place to post this message?
Thanks a lot,
Rohan Mutagi
