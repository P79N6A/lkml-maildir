I haven't tried that. Is that a safe thing to do ?
We do now disable mastering on all pci devices around the transition
as mandated in the spec, but that didn't really do much either.
Here's the patch I got from one user, which 'worked'...
Subject: [CPUFREQ] longhaul - avoid ide timeouts when bus mastering is off.
I really don't like this. Really.
Unfortunatly its necessary, otherwise after the transition, we live
for just a few minutes, and then just lockup.  In an ideal world,
the pm layer would allow some means of walking the device tree
quiescing DMA. Sadly, we don't live in an ideal world.
I'm open to suggestions on better ways to do this, as I'd rather
not push this to Linus' tree.

Whilst it may work fine, and 99.9% of VIA systems are likely IDE, it does
nothing about SCSI, so it's not quite perfect.
That said, even a 99% coverage is better than a 0% coverage we currently have.
It also seems quite racy, as it does nothing to prevent new transactions
from beginning after the drive has become idle.
