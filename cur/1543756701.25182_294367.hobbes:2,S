the big difference to mlock is that for mlock there _is_ a _limit_. For
RT scheduling the priority is _NOT_ a _limit_. Okay? So you give the
false pretense of this being some kind of resource 'limit', while in
fact allowing SCHED_FIFO prio 1 alone enables unprivileged users to lock
up the system.
so i could agree with RLIMIT_NICE (which _is_ a limit), but
RLIMIT_RTPRIO sends the wrong message. The proper rlimit would be
RLIMIT_RT_CPU (the patch i did).
