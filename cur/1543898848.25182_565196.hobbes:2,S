Just fine, on those machines where we know how to reinitialize the
video card.  We currently require userspace to offline all except the
boot cpu before suspending, but that could be moved into the kernel.
I have no particular attachment to that way of doing it; it was just a
"don't do things in the kernel that can be reasonably be done in
userspace" kind of thing.
