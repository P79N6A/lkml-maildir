for the records I worked-around it:
- problem seems to be the interface 'bond0', which is started first,
stops the ability to create another device named 'eth0' (WHY?)
- so I shifted all of the interface names: 0->1, 1->2,...
now it is ok. still I do not understand why bond0 seems to interfere
with eth0...
