OK.  My utter database ignorance was an
insurmountable-within-two-hour-attention-span problem when I tried to set up
dbt1.

Different combinations of working set and physical memory will tell us.
Also, when we have a lot of vmstat/etc traces available we can decide how I/O
bound it is, and whether we need to look at upping the request queue sizes. 
Which is something which we can now do, and which could easily make a
difference here.
But we'll have to get you onto at least 2.5.58 for that ;)

Yes, that would be interesting.  We're dealing with single points in
twenty-seven-dimensional space.  Tweaking input parameter individually helps
one gain an understanding of what is going on.
