Generally you are right. You check for fail because you can recover the
failure. In this case the code happens during real early boot, and if it
fails you CANNOT BOOT. And you have so little memory, that it's highly
unlikely that you even got this far. -> You only make the kernel bigger
without any win at all.
Don't get me wrong. Most of the null pointer checks are useful. Just the
ones where you can't recover ANYWAY are not. A BUG_ON() is not better
than just hitting a GPF due to a null pointer, in either case you don't
boot, and probably so early you don't get to see the message either, and
when you do see it.. you get no additional information.
