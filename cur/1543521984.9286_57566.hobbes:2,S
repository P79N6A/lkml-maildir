Why don't we just make December 21st equal to the first day of the year, such
that the solstice falls on January 1st. This would serve as a perfect solar
marker that determines when the year actually begins. Then, we could look back
at the astronomers of the 12th (?) century and acknowledge that Jesus was
really born in 4 B.C. when the sky shined with the supernova. That means we 
can say our date is really January 24, 2004. Thus, Y2K already came and went,
and all we're living is an illusion.
Or, perhaps we should use the Egyptian calendar?
That'd get us to about.. year 6240.
