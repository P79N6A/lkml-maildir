Some hypervisors don't emulate the traditional physical layout of the 
first 1M of memory, so those pages might never get physical mappings 
established during the boot process, causing access to them to fault.  
Presumably, if the first page is there with a good signature, the entire 
ROM is mapped.  I think Jeremy added this for Xen, and it's harmless on 
native hardware.
