Hi Pavel,
> AFAICS, sysfs should be mounted on /sys these days...
we can remove the hotplug-script from 2.4 and 2.6 completly, because the
firmware.agent script is now part of the linux-hotplug scripts and there
is no need to write one. You only have to put the firmware file into the
firmware directory, which is by default /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/ and
everything works as expected.
Regards
Marcel
