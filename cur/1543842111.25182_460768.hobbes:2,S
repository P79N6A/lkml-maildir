Silly question, why can't you do all this from stop_machine_run context (or
your SMI) that doesn't have to worry about other CPUs dirtying memory?

Given that it doesn't touch core mm/ code, I don't really care about it[*]
except that it doesn't make sense to have the tracking hooks in generic code
because it is pretty specific to your module.
Also, as far as a "notifier" goes, it is of course completely broken unless
your module is the only one that is ever going to use it. Which I suspect
may be the case ;) But you do really need to at least WARN_ON or fail if
someone is going to break it like this.
[*] Though if it gets included, it would not stop me lamenting the
proliferation of complexities to support *tiny* obscure userbases. Can
we wait until your hardware is smart enough to snoop the cc? :)
