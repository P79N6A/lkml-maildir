The problem is the aac based cards generate events (AIFs) that are
picked up by the driver. To go all the way to userland to interpret
these events and back to the driver is a waste and a source of failures.
Only the Firmware knows when an array zeroing has completed in order to
bring the device online.

I would need to emulate an SES to propagate array changes?

What was wrong with scsi_scan_single_target (add), scsi_rescan_device
(remove/change)?
