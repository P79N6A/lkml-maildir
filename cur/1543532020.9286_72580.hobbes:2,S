Here's the contents of(Slack7) /var/log/XFree86.0.log
Removing /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/ from the valid list of

XFree86-Bigfont extension: shmget() failed, size = 4096, errno = 22
XFree86-Bigfont extension: shmget() failed, size = 4096, errno = 22
XFree86-Bigfont extension: shmget() failed, size = 4096, errno = 22
XFree86-Bigfont extension: shmget() failed, size = 4096, errno = 22
