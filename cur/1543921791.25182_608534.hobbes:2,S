It is just not feasible to add ACLs to all million files in /home,
also because ACLs are limited to around 25 entries.
And it is obvious I do not want <prof> to have UID 0, because
then you cannot distinguish who created what file.
So the requirement to the task is to have unique UIDs.
The next logical step would be to give capabilities to those UIDs.
*Is that wrong*? Who says that only UID 0 is allowed to have
all 31 capability bits turned on, and that all non-UID 0 users
need to have all 31 capability bits turned off?
So, we give caps to the subadmins (which is IMHO a natural task),
and then, as per LSM design (wonder where that is written) deny
some of the rights that the capabilities raised for subadmins grant,
because that is obviously too much.
