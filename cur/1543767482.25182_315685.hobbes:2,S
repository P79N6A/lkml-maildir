I'm doing it by hand at every reboot. Just discovered this stupid Gentoo 
default setting:
# If you want to sync the system clock to the hardware clock during
# shutdown, then say "yes" here.
CLOCK_SYSTOHC="no"
In other words, the kernel does not auto-adjusts the hardware clock? Well, 
that's not nice... (maybe only the Gentoo setting).
Regards.
