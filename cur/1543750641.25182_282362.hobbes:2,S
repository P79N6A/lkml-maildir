Hi,
Seems our cards are very similar, out of interest what kernel are you 
running, and whats your kernel .config, Would it be anything to do with 
running it in a pci-x slot, although that shouldent be an issue. What is 
the possiblity of a hardware fault, dont want to organise an RMA then 
them tell me its fine under winblows, is there anyway to spew out a bit 
more info on the error, or run a test on it?
Thanks
Joel
