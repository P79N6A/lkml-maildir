Subject: [PATCH 6/28] remove RPM_BUILD_ROOT from asm-offsets.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Olaf Hering <olh@suse.de>
No file in rpm binary package should have the RPM_BUILD_ROOT string in it.
To simplify building of external modules, our kernel-source package
contains some temp files from the Kbuild system.  asm/asm-offsets.h is one
of the files that contains the absolute path if make O=$O is used.
  * This file was generated by /var/tmp/kernel-source-2.6.14_rc4-build/usr/src/linux-2.6.14-rc4-2/Kbuild
Remove the $RPM_BUILD_ROOT string in the shipped tempfile.
