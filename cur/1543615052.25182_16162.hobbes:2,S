keeping a terminal with ssh open all day is feasible (and is what I
and a lot of others probably do). Keeping mozilla open all day is
not practical. (and no, w3m/lynx etc are not practical for using
bugzilla imo).

both mua's I use have comprehensive indexing/searching abilities.
s25<enter> saves a patch for applying later.
cat ~/25 | patch -p1  is all I need to do, plus I have an archive
of patches applied on what date, along with the descriptive mails
that went with them.
Effortless.
If a patch needs reversing, I load the mua, move the mail to another
folder, and do the same with patch -R
