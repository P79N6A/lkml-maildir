Spec is here:

  (Horribly long URL and registration required,
unfortunately).
In this case, the controller needs to be specifically told what command
and response type it should expect, thus the opcode switch.
I don't really think this is an  unreasonable demand to be put on the 
hardware driver, and its certainly way more HW specific then the upper 
layers need to be.
As for Russell's comments - yes, the mm_remove_host() should be called
first, thats my ugly.  As for the second one - we haven't had problems
so far with enabling the interrupt after the mmc_add_host() command -
but I can see how its entirely possible thats just a result of luck, and
not skill.   I'll look in to ways to fix that up.
