Memtest did not find anything after 16 passes so I finally stopped it
applied your patch and used
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB_LEAK=y
and booted into the new kernel.
A few hours later the machine hung (due to nmi watchdog rebooted), so I
restarted and disabled the watchdog and while compiling a kernel with a
``more minimal'' config I got this (not sure whether this is related/the
cause .../ note that I don't use a swapfile/partition).
I would need more guidance on what to try now...
Thanks!
