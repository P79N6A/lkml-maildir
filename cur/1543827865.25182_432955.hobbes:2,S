I could have sworn that DSL uses its own framing protocol that is 
similar to the frame/superframe structure of HDSL ( T1 ) lines and over 
that you can run ATM or ethernet.  Or is it typically ethernet -> ATM -> 
HDSL?
In any case, why does the kernel care about the exact time that the IP 
packet has been received and reassembled on the headend?
