updatedb & cat /dev/random
is how you write it in /bin/sh, an empty statement such as between
the & and the ; in your example isn't allowed

Yes, only some drivers add to the randomness pool.  I belive
the original problem was that the driver for his SCSI controller
doesn't add randomness, so nothing but keyboard input and mouse 
input would give him more randomness.  What he ought to do is
to modify the request_irq call in the SCSI driver and add 
SA_RANDOM to the flags, otherwise running updatedb won't help.
