If that were true, anyone who could send those packets to your machine would
be able to cause the system to hang too. Perhaps you are feeding the packets
back in at too high a layer.

What object is this queue logically associated with? If the socket, you
should probably hook 'release' so you can purge the queue when the socket is
removed.
