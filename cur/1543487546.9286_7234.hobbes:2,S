When multiple applications issue a select on the same device (driver), 
Is there any way to notify only one of the application from the driver?
For ex.
Application0                             Application1
fd0 = open("/dev/dev1");                 fd1 = open("/dev/dev1");
select(fd0, ..);                         select(fd1,...)
-----------------
Kernel space
static int select(struct inode *inode, struct file *filep)
{
	interruptible_sleep_on(&wq); 
}
When I do a wake_up on the "wq", how *only Application0* can be notified?
(Application0 should not be notified);
Thanks,
jalaja
