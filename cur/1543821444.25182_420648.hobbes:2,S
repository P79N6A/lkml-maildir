Yeah, stupid cut-and-paste error (the eisa_set_level_irq() call _is_ 
already there in the PCI irq setting, for the case where we actually have 
to set up routing that didn't exist before).
That's also why I'm a bit nervous even about my stupid one-liner patch: if 
the irq routing is already set up, and we just use the irq we're told to 
use, I'm not sure we should touch ELCR even if it "looks wrong". It 
obviously works on your machine, but I wonder what could break on others..
