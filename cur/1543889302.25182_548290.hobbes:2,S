Subject: [RFC 4/5] inode reservation v0.1 (benchmark result)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Current patch avoids inodes from different directories mixed together in
the inode table. Therefore the benchmakr emulate a situation that mixes
inodes of different sub-directories together. and record the time on
removing them all.
In the first part, reserving 16 inodes for each new created directory.
Therefore 14 files can only use 1 reserved block for each directory in
inode table, obviously, the result of benchmark is the best case :-)
Enviornment:
1) create 9890 directory, create files in each directory alternatively
2) kernel version 2.6.20-mm, the ext4 subdir-inode-reservation is
patched based on 2.6.20-mm
3) 14 files in each subdirectory. 9890 sub directories in
mount_point/mailbox/
4) mount with option data=writeback
5) each operation followed by a reboot
6) EXT4_INIT_RESERVE_INODES = 16
===================== data=writeback ================================
remove directories and files by rm -rf:

Due to the bad design of magic inode and the on-disk layout of magic
inode. When 30 files created alternatively in each directory, no
performance advantage exists. When 50 files created alternatively in
each directory, the patched ext4 will use double time on removing all
the files and directories.
Therefore, in the next version a new on-disk layout will be used.
