The fact is, these days nobody wants to be a stable-release maintainer
anymore. It's boring.
I don't agree that the new development is "better" in the sense of keeping
stability and quality, but I can't blame Andrew for that. Let people do
whatever they like to do, and they'll do a better job.
So unless someone steps up and does it, there is no point in arguing. Of
course, s/he won't be an "official maintainer" as endorsed/appointed by
Linus like previous releases, but that might be better as it's more like
"people choose XXX" instead of "Linus forces XXX onto people"? :)
