Hi,
after booting a 2.4.0 (any testx-release I've tried so far, including
test11-pre2) on a Dual-Pentium III box, the system works ok, but the
console gets filled with
APIC error on CPU0: 08(08)
every couple of seconds, occasionally some lines in between say
APIC error on CPU0: 08(02)
and
APIC error on CPU0: 02(08)
This doesn't happen with 2.2.x, but I've seen "unexpected IRQ vector 208
on CPU0" in 2.2.18 occasionally (nowhere near as often, maybe once a
month).
This is an ASUS P2-D board (Intel 440BX chipset), 2 Pentium III-700
processors.
The same kernel works perfectly on a similar (but slower) system, Gigabyte
P2B-D board (Intel 440BX chipset), 2 Pentium III-450 processors.
