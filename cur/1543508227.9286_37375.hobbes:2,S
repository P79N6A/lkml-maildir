   When I perform "search files" action in Midnight Commander 
   sometimes I see a lot of messages on the console:
 ...
   Sep  4 16:57:18 localhost kernel: iput: Aieee, semaphore in use inode
   00:00/10969, count=2 
   Sometimes I can reproduce this behaviour, sometimes not. 
   It happens for example when I search files in the kernel tree.
Is this operation scanning over a CDROM/iso9660 filesystem?
If yes, we are working on this problem.
Later,
