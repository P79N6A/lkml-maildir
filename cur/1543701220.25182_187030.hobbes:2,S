With thanks to Arjan, I think we've proven that this is not the change
which is causing the problem by testing various Red Hat and Fedora 2.4
kernels on the machine (which have various 2.6 NPTL backports.)
I'm now back to being completely out of my depth on this issue; a 2.4
kernel booted through to init=/bin/bash suspends, but a 2.6 kernel
with the same hardware support booted to the same point refuses to
suspend via APM.
I think I'm going to have to resort to a binary search of the 2.5
kernel series to find out exactly what broke and when.
