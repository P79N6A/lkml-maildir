David has a good point here.  It is worth emphasizing that what you believe
to be true may not be legally true.  Everyone believes certain things about
the GPL but those beliefs are just opinions.
If David is correct, and what he is saying seems plausible, then because
there is no click through, shrink wrap, or written agreement to the GPL,
if you had the rights to the software *before* it was modified then
you had those rights, end of story.  And the GPL grants those rights
to everyone.  This is why almost 100% of the other licenses in the world
start out with "XYZ expressly  reserves  all  rights  in  the Software
not specifically granted to Licensee."
I think people should read his posting below carefully, which is why I
quoted it.
