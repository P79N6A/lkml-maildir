I think the 'more urgent things to be fixed' point is important.
Only a certain amount of patches can go in to 2.4.23 if we want to
keep this a short development cycle, and efforts to stabilise 2.4 so
that embedded users who are still using 2.2 have something to migrate
to are important.
I'd like to see 2.4 become the stable choice for embedded users that
2.2 is now, before 2.6 becomes the standard for new non-embedded
machines within a year.
John.
