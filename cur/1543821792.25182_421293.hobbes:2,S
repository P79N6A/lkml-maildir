Well, when it happened to me it was because I switched from a distro
kernel to a custom build and so the error was entirely on my part. I
still think that some kind of warning in the dmesg or appropriate
wording in the help for the framebuffer devices or for fbcon would
help sort this FAQ out.
OTOH, if the OP made oldconfig it would be interesting to see what
caused the change in configuration ...
