Subject: Makefile dependancies: scripts depending on configured kernel?

Hey,
the top level Makefile specifies that the scripts depend on the kernel 
being configured before the scripts can be built:
scripts: scripts_basic include/config/MARKER
	$(Q)$(MAKE) $(build)=$(@)
I think that this is probably a problem, because it means people can't 
build any of the documentation targets without having configured the kernel.
Do any of the scripts actually depend on a configured kernel to build? 
How can I verify that none of them need a configured kernel? Commenting 
out the dependancy didn't break anything.
Thanks,
Mikal
