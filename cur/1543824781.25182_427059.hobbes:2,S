Oh please keep them, I have fixed the code to work with the direct
data :)
Now I have removed the radix tree look-aside cache, and cut down the
new radix tree functions to three core ones:
        - __radix_tree_lookup_parent()
        - radix_tree_scan_hole_backward()
        - radix_tree_scan_hole()
In the hope that it be easier for you to work with.
