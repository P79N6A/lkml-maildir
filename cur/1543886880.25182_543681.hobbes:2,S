HPA is both right and wrong on this.  The safe sequence for entering
protected mode requires a jump immediately after setting PE in %cr0.
To serialize the instruction stream and to be on an execution that
is tested and guaranteed to work in cpus.
On a lot of processors you can get away with more then that, but
Intel at least explicitly states in their "Software Developers Manual
Volume 3: System Programming" in 9.9.1 "Switching to Protected Mode"
that you need the jump immediately following enabling PE in cr0.
So while I was debugging and instrumenting code I would happily
place an instruction before the jump so I could get output.
However in production grade code I would not place anything
between the setting of PE in cr0 and the first jump instruction.
