I agree.
Further, while there is an RFC for SPF, it is an RFC for an
experimental protocol. In addition to what David points out in his web
site, SPF is controversial, and is in competition with other
approaches.  (See RFC 4408.)
It's not widely deployed. It doesn't work. It'll break standard-abiding email.
Do you really want that?
