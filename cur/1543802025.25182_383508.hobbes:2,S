How about this usage (branch == tree):
Tree A    (your tree)
  Tree B     (project B, dependent on Tree A)
     Tree C     (project C, dependent on project B)
(i.e. diff(C-A) = diff(C-B) + diff(B-A))
Your tree is pulled into Tree A as often as your tree
changes and it just fast forwards.
If I want to run project B with your latest tree, then
I resolve/merge from tree A to tree B, compile B
and run it.
If I want to run project C and project B with your
latest tree, I resolve/merge from tree A to tree B
and from tree B to tree C, compile C and run it.
In such cases, are you saying that you'd prefer to
pull from Tree B and Tree C (depending on your needs)?
Another question:
Sometimes, a fix for project B finds its way into
tree C (project C) (since C depended on that fix in B).
Now I'd like to pull that particular fix, identified by
its SHA, into project B, and nothing else, for this I can
use git-cherry-pick, right?
And lastly, is there a tool whereby I can "see" changes
between repos, kind of like git-diff but being able to
give URLs too?
