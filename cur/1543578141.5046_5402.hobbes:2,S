Hi - 
	Based on my quick reading of this patch:
+
+empty:
+	spin_lock(&mmlist_lock);
+	return 0;
The above should actually be spin_UNlock?
Also the test for !inactive_shortage() seems to be inverted?
+		/* If refill_inactive_scan failed, try to page stuff out.. */
+		swap_out(priority, gfp_mask);
+	} while (!inactive_shortage());
