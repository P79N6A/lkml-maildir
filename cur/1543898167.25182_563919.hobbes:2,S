Don't aim for perfection.
If your program also accepts a path or file as input (instead of 
extracting it from a patch) you'll get it with nearly zero extra effort.

checkpatch.pl checks a patch, not an email.
And e.g. in my workflow there isn't any technical correlation between 
some "Cc:" field in a patch and the recipients of the email containing 
it since I'm not using any fancy scripts for maintaining and sending 
patches.

A tool that simply would output some email addresses to Cc when given a 
patch is something I would most likely use since it would fit in my 
workflow and replace manual looks at MAINTAINERS.
Something big is less likely to be adapted unless it nearly perfectly 
suits the needs of the people intended to use it.
But it's your program, so it's your choice what you implement and in 
what language you implement it.
