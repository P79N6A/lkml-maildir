I presume that the intention here is to allow a newly woken task that 
preempts the current task to stop the load balancing?
As I see it (and I may be wrong), for this to happen, the task must have 
woken before the run queue locks were taken (otherwise it wouldn't have 
got as far as activation) i.e. before move_tasks() is called and 
therefore you may as well just do this check at the start of move_tasks().
However, a newly woken task that preempts the current task isn't the 
only way that needs_resched() can become true just before load balancing 
is started.  E.g. scheduler_tick() calls set_tsk_need_resched(p) when a 
task finishes a time slice and this patch would cause rebalance_tick() 
to be aborted after a lot of work has been done in this case.
In summary, I think that the bail out is badly placed and needs some way 
of knowing if the reason need_resched() has become true is because of 
preemption of a newly woken task and not some other reason.

PS I've added Nick Piggin to the CC list as he is interested in load 
balancing issues.
