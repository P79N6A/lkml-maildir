Trond,
An old problem seems to reappear with linux-2.2.12-nfsv3-0.11.8.dif
applied.  I'm able to copy files to a share mounted from an NT 4.0sp3
server, but all processes concerned hang hard when attempting to delete
the same file.  'ps' shows them hung in a 'D' state.
This happened a few months back with one of your earlier patches, but I
don't remember what the fix consisted of.
I backed out the diffs, and the problem went away.  Can you take a look at
this?
Steve
