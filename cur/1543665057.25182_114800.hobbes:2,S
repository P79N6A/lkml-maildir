The compiler was in both cases:
gcc version 3.2.3 20030228 (Debian prerelease)
2.4.20:
2271565 Feb 25 17:08 vmlinux
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
1730302  112564  176676 2019542  1ed0d6 vmlinux
2.5.63:
2561828 Mar  4 16:50 vmlinux
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
1867787  167450  140292 2175529  213229 vmlinux
As I said, the 2.4 kernel has almost everything built in while 2.5 was
stripped down to minimum size possible. The latter is still unusable
since modules do not work. :/
