In this case, I think it would be entirely appropriate.  It's hardly a 
hardship to maintain the legacy names for backwards compatibility; since 
those names are nonsensical it is unlikely they'll ever want to be 
claimed, in which case they can be maintained indefinitely.
However, I would find it much, much worse if names that are *actively 
misleading and confusing* to the programmer would be included in an 
international standard and therefore forced upon the rest of the world 
forever.
