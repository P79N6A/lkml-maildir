Subject: [PATCH] 2.4: updated preemptive kernel patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is the preemptive kernel patch, supported by MontaVista.  Updated
patches for 2.4.18, 2.4.19-pre5, and 2.4.19-pre4-ac3 are now available
at:
	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/preempt-kernel
as well as older patches for older kernel revisions.
The only major change aside from the sync up is some simple debug code
that will catch most any preempt_count oddity without much overhead,
courtesy of Andrew Morton.  Basically just check the preempt_count for a
non-zero value on do_exit.
Nothing pending in the 2.4 codebase.  I have a bunch of changes queued
for preempt-stats which I will get out real soon now.  For 2.5, there
are a couple of indirect preempt-related optimizations and lock-fixings
in store soon.
