Then it looks like the oops report isn't very helpful, as it's
pointing us to the results of the corrupted list rather than the place
where the list is being corrupted in the first place?
Is there any way we can pinpoint where things are going awry?  Like I
said, this is on a uniprocessor machine, it's persisted through two
kernel revisions, it only occurs during one type of activity (IP
Masqing of certain connections) and it's easily repeatable.  I'm not
above printk debugging (or is there a linux kernel equivalent of
assert()?) if there was some likely place to look.
