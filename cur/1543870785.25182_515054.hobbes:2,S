Ingo defined them as "plain function calls as long as they do not block".
But when/what function could block?
(1) File descriptors. Read. If data are in cache it wouldn't block.
Otherwise it would. Write. If there is space in cache it wouldn't
block. Otherwise it would.
(2) Network sockets. Recv. If data are in buffer they wouldn't block.
Otherwise they would. Send. If there is space in send buffer it
wouldn't block. Otherwise it would.
(3) Pipes, fifos & unix sockets. Unfortunately gain nothing since the
reliable local communication used mostly for control information
passing. If you have to block on such socket it most likely important
information anyway. (e.g. X server communication or sql query to SQL
server). (Or even less important here case of shell pipes.) And most
users here are all single threaded and I/O bound: they would gain
nothing from multi-threading - only PITA of added locking.
What I'm trying to get to: keep things simple. The proposed
optimization by Ingo does nothing else but allowing AIO to probe file
cache - if data there to go with fast path. So why not to implement
what the people want - probing of cache? Because it sounds bad? But
they are in fact proposing precisely that just masked with "fast
threads".
