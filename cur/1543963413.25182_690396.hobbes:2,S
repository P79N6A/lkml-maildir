Especially with an MCE versus evidence of random bit flipping, I would 
also check to verify that all your memory modules are seated correctly. 
  If you are only using one of the DIMMs with LOWMEM only then you may 
be avoiding one which has a flakey connection.
I have solved at least one other mysterious MCE problem by reseating the 
DIMMS.
Cheers,
Dan
