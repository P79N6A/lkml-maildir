Technically speaking, a single filename can be as large as PATH_MAX-1.
The comment is just a warning, though, to explain the dreary theoretical
side of the world.  Pragmatism demands that we just use
INOTIFY_FILENAME_MAX, which is a more reasonable 256.

Indeed!  Although we define MAX_INOTIFY_DEV_WATCHERS right above and it
is a power of two.

Probably should just be an 'unsigned int' everywhere.
But there are a few variables that have the same name in various
structures.  That confuses me to no end, but I am jumpy like that.

Oh, dude, inotify is a godsend.
