No, SD does nothing different in this regard. There is no notion of who made 
the thread and who the remaining timeslice should go to. As you say, some 
decision on sched_exit should probably be used to decide where to send it. In 
the absence of yet more fields in task_struct, the easiest thing to do would 
be to check if the the thread id is equal to the pid and if not, send it to 
the pid (or any parent of that if it no longer exists). Whether it's worth 
adding yet another field to task_struct to track this or not I do not have 
enough information to make an informed choice in this regard. Either way I'm 
low on patch-creation cycles so please feel free to provide your solution.
