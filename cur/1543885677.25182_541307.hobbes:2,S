I guess the main reason, at least for me, is that there is only one 
distro that properly supports LE ARM: Debian.
It greatly simplifies management/administration of a higher number of 
devices, given the fact that Debian also supports other architectures 
(not just x86/64, sometimes PPC, like most distros do).
Not always network performance is to most important factor.
