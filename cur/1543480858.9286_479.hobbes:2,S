Hi HJ,
You would certainly be well-advised to check 2.2.0 yourself, but I can
report no problems whatever using Linus's current code.  Alan Cox went
through his usual heroic efforts and fed them in bit-by-bit <g>.
Historically, if there any features to be tripped over in the nfs client
or server, I'll be guaranteed to stumble on them.  All looks good here.
Steve
