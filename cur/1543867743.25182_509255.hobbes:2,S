LTTng is using the marker infrastructure since last november. Me and my
users have been very happy with it.

I think the final agreement was the need for some kind of code marking
system, which I tried to implement as best as I could. It gives very
good performances while tracing (advantage of static tracing), has a
very very minimal performance and binary size impact when disabled
(advantage of dynamic tracing) and it can be activated dynamically
(advantage of dynamic tracing).
