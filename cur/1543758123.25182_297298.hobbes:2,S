Subject: [PATCH 2.6.11-rc4] oom_kill.c: Kill obvious processes first
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/2/25/5

oom_kill.c misses very obvious targets - For example, a process occupying > 
80% memory, not superuser and not having hardware access gets ignored by it. 
Logically, such a process, if killed , is going to make things return to 
normal thereby eliminating the need for oom killer to further scan for more 
processes.
This patch calculates the approximate integer percentage of memory occupied by 
the process by looking at num_physpages and p->mm->total_vm. If this process 
is not super user and doesn't have hardware access, and the percentage of 
occupied memory is more than 60%, it immediately selects this process for 
killing by returning unusually high points from badness().
Without this patch, when KDevelop running as non root user gobbles up 90% 
memory, the OOM killer kills many other irrelevant processes but not KDevelop 
And machine never recovers.. (Pls see LKML for my previous message with 
subject "2.6.11-rc4 OOM Killer - Kill the Innocent".) 
With this patch OOM killer immediately kills kdevelop and machine recovers.
