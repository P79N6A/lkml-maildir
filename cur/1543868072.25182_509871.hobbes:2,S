Oh that's not a bad idea of course. I've been testing it like that for ages, 
and there are many -ck users who have testified to swap prefetch helping in 
low memory situations for real as well. Now how do you turn those testimonies 
into convincing arguments? Maintainers are far too busy off testing code for 
16+ cpus, petabytes of disk storage and so on to try it for themselves.  Plus 
they worry incessantly that my patches may harm those precious machines' 
performance...
