Based on only a quick look at the code: if the Windows host is present,
don't call pci_common_init() in ixdp425_pci_init(). You then need to
write the entire CONFIG_PCI_GADGET code, and ensure that you only enable
it if the Windows host is present.
The greater problem is that these changes may work all the way up into
your application. If the Windows host is present, then you need its
cooperation to find other devices on the PCI bus.
