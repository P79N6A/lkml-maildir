Hmm, I think my question was badly worded. :)
I guess this is a *distribution* thing as opposed to a kernel thing, if
it really is just a matter of including it in a keymap.
I guess I mean: In a standard VGA console, can you bring up a Euro symbol
by pressing the right keyboard combination?  Anyone know what this 
combination *is*?  Keyboards nowadays are having the "Euro" symbol printed
on the "E" key...
Tris.
