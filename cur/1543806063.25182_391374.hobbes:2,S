It ensures that you get the logic of the reference counting correctly.
It forces you to do the logic of the get and put and release properly.
To roughly quote Andrew Morton, "When I see a kref, I know it is used
properly, otherwise I am forced to read through the code to see if the
author got the reference counting logic correct."
It costs _nothing_ to use it, and let's everyone know you got the logic
correct.
So don't feel it is a "abstraction", it's a helper for both the author
(who doesn't have to get the atomic_t calls correct), and for everyone
else who has to read the code.
