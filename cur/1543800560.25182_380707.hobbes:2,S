As a general rule a driver should push as much functionality to
libraries and the infrastructure code as possible.

I haven't looked closely enough at the state of the openib tree but
you should not need an additional interface to send/receive standard
IB subnet management packets.  That is something that should be provided
the same way by all infiniband drivers.
The only case I can think of where this might not already exist
is the code that responds to the subnet manager.  If the current
interfaces are not sufficient then the infiniband layer needs
more work.

Given Linus's comments and looking at where you are getting stuck I
would recommend you split out support for the nonstandard ipath
protocol from the rest of the driver.  If the standard infiniband
interfaces for kernel bypass are not sufficient for flinging packets
then we need to re-examine them.
