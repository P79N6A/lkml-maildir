It is simple enough, and it does fixe real bug. However at the time it
was decided that the change should not go into 2.4 because it breaks the
VFS API for 3rd party filesystems. Basically anyone that might be using
iget4 and/or read_inode2 will have to change their filesystem in the
middle of a supposedly stable series.
I believe that argument still stands. Ofcourse anyone using the existing
iget4/read_inode[2] interface is pretty much guaranteed to have broken
code.

Yeah, I actually hit that bug while working on Coda which prompted the
whole iget5_locked implementation. The fix I used for 2.4 is trivial but
inefficient. Just grab a lock around any call to iget4. I think I used a
semaphore as I wasn't sure whether the iget4 code would sleep.
