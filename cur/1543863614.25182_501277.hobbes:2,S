Yes,... but as I've just told Alan,... it happens even when just
mounting (an not using libdvdcss at all).

That was already done (by factory I assume):
# regionset /dev/hdb
regionset version 0.1 -- reads/sets region code on DVD drives
Current Region Code settings:
RPC Phase: II
type: SET
vendor resets available: 4
user controlled changes resets available: 4
drive plays discs from region(s): 2, mask=0xFD
Would you like to change the region setting of your drive? [y/n]:n

Playing just works normal (even without recreation of the dvdcss cache)
it's just the syslog message when mounting that makes me nervous ;)
Thanks,
