EXPORT_SYMBOL() is a no-op when modules are disabled:
$ size arch/i386/kernel/i386_ksyms.o
    text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
       0       0       0       0       0 arch/i386/kernel/i386_ksyms.o
Although, what really should be done is to move the exports to the 
appropriate files instead of keeping them lumped together.
