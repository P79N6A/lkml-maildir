Thanks, Chris.
Am I right that is chipset on mainboard, who is saying - "I know....", not 
CPU itself? Is it better to switch off HT support in BIOS?
Is it possible to generate CPU name as: "Pentium D 930" in /proc/cpuinfo?
On the other server I have some 2GHz HT Xeons which can't be identified on 
Intel site because of strange naming pattern.
I tried to find any utility for Linux to solve this, but it looks like 
everybody are using /pros/cpuinfo, which is not enough :)
