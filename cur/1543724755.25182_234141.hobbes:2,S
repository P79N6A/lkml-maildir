David,
there are 2 reports about breakage by this patch. One is on lkml, and
another one is in my bugzilla inbox. How can we fix that one? I assume
that handoff patch is correct.
  <6>NET: Registered protocol family 17
  <3>ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: BIOS handoff failed (104, 1010001)
  <3>ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: can't reset
  <3>ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: init 0000:00:1d.7 fail, -95
  <4>ehci_hcd: probe of 0000:00:1d.7 failed with error -95
this is a FSC Amilo D7830 notebook, the guy on lkml has a  Asus P4P800 board.
