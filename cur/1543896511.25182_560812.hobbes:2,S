I'm pretty sure others do it too.
Maybe not on an OS level (but I actually doubt that - I'd be surprised if 
Windows doesn't do the exact same thing), but I know for a fact that a lot 
of people in threaded libraries end up depending very much on the "simple 
store closes a locked section".
Just googling for "xchg" "mov" "spinlock" "-linux" shows discussion boards 
for Windows developers with open-coded spinlocks like
	int ResourceFlag = 0; // 0=Free, 1=Inuse
	...
	// Wait until we get the resource
	while(InterlockedExchange(&ResourceFlag, 1) != 0) {
	   Sleep(0); } // Wait a tad
	// Have the resource
	... // do your thing
	ResourceFlag = 0; // Release the resource
and that's definitely Windows code, not some Linux person doing it.
And this is from an OS2 forum
	unsigned owned=0;
	void request() {
	  while(LockedExchanged(&owned,1)!=0)
	    ;
	}
	void release() {
	  owned = 0;
	}
so it's not even something unusual.
So while arguably these people don't know (and don't care) about subtle 
issues like memory ordering, I can *guarantee* that a lot of programs 
depend on them, even if that dependency may often come from a lack of 
knowledge, rather than actively understanding what we do like in the Linux 
kernel community.
(And yes, they rely on compilers not reordering either. Tough.)
