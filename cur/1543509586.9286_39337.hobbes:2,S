Hi Bob,
there's a _big_ problem with the advansys driver as
included with the newer kernels. They don't detect
my APB940U card, not even if I explicity tell the
address (which seems to be illigal for PCI cards
anyway).
The latest kernel that I've successfully tested is
2.2.12-pre1. There might be working ones after that,
but I haven't tested that.
regards,
Rik
