"Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff...."
is almost always indicative of a kernel bug and not a memory error.
Please gather bug reporting data and report it as described in the
file: REPORTING-BUGS in the kernel source tree's top-level directory.
However:  if the kernel is very old, the answer may be just to use a
newer kernel version.  Or if the kernel is a vendor-supported kernel
version, then that vendor is probably where the bug report should go.
