Subject: new driver to replace LMC

To whom it may concern,
I work with linux drivers for wan cards (etc.), and
there is a driver currently in the kernel (for some of
the devices I work with) which is way old. 
I'd be happy to submit the new driver (at least the
replacement for the stale stuff being passed around)
to be wrapped in new kernel versions ... but I don't
know who would be best to write re this subject.
I would appreciate help in being pointed to the right
direction for this.
The "old" driver that I'm talking about is the Lan
Meadia, Corp driver.  LMC was bought-out awhile ago,
and since then many bug fixes have been made, etc.
Thanks in advance,
David
