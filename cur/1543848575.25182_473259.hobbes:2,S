It isn't misbehaving it just isn't available. MWI is rather different to
say pci_set_master() in that it makes a lot of sense for many drivers to
ask for it but not care about the results. Something like pci_set_master
failing is a big problem and has to be handled (although as we often
don't use BIOS PCI services we see fake success in some cases).
MWI is an "extra cheese" option not a "no pizza" case
