You know, a more concise way of stating my underlying question might be:
	Does POSIX require that programs be aware of signals, in the
	"returning EINTR" sense, if they do not use signals, and only use
	pthreads?
I might want to write a program that uses pthreads instead of signals to
handle asynchronous program behavior so that said program might be
portable to a system that implements pthreads but not signals.
