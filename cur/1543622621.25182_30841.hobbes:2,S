Besides IPsec, what crypto is there for the kernel?  I've never really
understood what "crypto in the kernel means" since it all should be a
userspace thing.
Except IPsec, of course, and adding Freeswan would be a Good Thing. 
Freeswan people?
One thing I've heard in the past is "Yes, the US is safe now wrt
encryption but <country> is not" -- and I've seen country=France,etc
i.e. (self) important places.
