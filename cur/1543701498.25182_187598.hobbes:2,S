That would be either xemacs's or indent's fault. Can't be my
fault. No sir. Anyway, unless whitespace-mode is lying to me now, no
line has more than at most one character of whitespace added. If it
bugs you, I'll clean it up - it's a slow night tonight ;-)

Sure thing: 
- switch lock_set_fmt() and unlock_set_fmt() from macros to inline
functions. Macros that call return() are EVIL.
- simplify lock_set_fmt() and implement it via test_and_set_bit()
rather than a spinlock protecting an int.
- fix a bug wherein we would do an up() on a semaphore that hasn't
been down()ed if a signal happened after timeout in trident_write().
- fix a bug where we would not release the open_sem on OOM.
- make the arguments for prog_dmabuf clearer (int -> enum), and add
two wrapper functions around it, one for record and one for playback. 
- fix a bug where we would call VALIDATE_STATE after
lock_kernel(). Since VALIDATE_STATE does 'return' if validation fails,
bad things can happen. Thanks to Dawson Engler <engler@stanford.edu>
and the Stanford checker for spotting.
- remove the calls to lock_kernel() from trident_release() and
trident_mmap(). trident_release() appears to be covered by the
open_sem, and trident_mmap() is covered by state->sem.

Entirely my pleasure.
