Subject: [2.6 patch] document that 8139TOO supports 8129/8130
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/22/120

The 8129/8130 support is a sub-option that is not visible if the user 
hasn't enabled the 8139 support.
Let's make it a bit easier for users to find the driver for their nic.
