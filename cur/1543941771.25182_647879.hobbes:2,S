Subject: Coexistence of EXPORT_SYMBOL() and __cpuinit

In kernel/cpu.c, there exists API that is declared as __cpuinit, and
at the same time exported via EXPORT_SYMBOL().
Can these two attribute coexists at the same time?   I mean, when it
is declared with EXPORT_SYMBOL, according to include/linux/module.h,
it is placed in a __ksymtab section, and when compiled with with
__cpuinit, according to include/linux/init.h, into a __cpuinit
section.
Can gcc compiled ELF support this feature?
Anyway, logical speaking, if it is EXPORT_SYMBOL, it is meant to be
long-lasting, and not short-live as __cpuinit is meant to be, right?
Please comment, thanks.
If ok, I will modify the cpu.c to remove all the __cpuinit whenever
EXPORT_SYMBOL is encountered for it (or any __init in general :-)).
