Yeah, I actually spotted that one too a few months ago, but it looks like
I forgot to send out an email about it (oops).  I'd recommend removing
the loop entirely, because:
  * It doesn't seem to be common to re-try setting the latency timer in
    other drivers
  * Since the "break" was running unconditionally (due to the bug) the
    driver was never re-trying anyway, and we seem to have survived.
