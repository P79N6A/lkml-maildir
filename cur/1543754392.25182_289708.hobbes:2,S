i do believe it is not robust to give unprivileged users RT priorities,
without safeguards installed. Most normal desktops have some sort of
audio playback capability, so this problem needs a robust, API-neutral
and configurable/flexible solution.
RT-LSM and rlimit privileges are configurable, API-neutral but not
robust, while rt_cpu_limit is robust but not flexible. SCHED_ISO meets
all those needs.
there's a fourth option which is simpler than SCHED_ISO: in the previous
mail i've announced the RLIMIT_RT_CPU_RATIO feature, which should meet
all these requirements as well: the security and API ease-of-use of
rt_cpu_limit, and the maximum flexibility of rlimits. (It also has the
extra bonus of enabling the tweaking/securing of existing RT classes,
which SCHED_ISO doesnt do.)
