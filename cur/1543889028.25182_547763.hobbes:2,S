Can you dump the memory BAR for this device?  I guess lspci hides it by 
default.  You may also be able to see it using 'od -t 
x4 /sys/devices/pci0000\:00/0000:02:02.0/config'.  I'm not sure how much 
that'll help though, you may be able to see which device its resources are 
overlapping with, but unless your BIOS gives you an option to disable it 
or change the way PCI space is allocated, you may be stuck...
