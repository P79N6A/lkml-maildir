I completely agree with that aswell.

And replacing the existing aio code is exactly we I want you to do.  We
can't keep adding more and more code without getting rid of old mess forever.
And yes, the asynchronous pagecache population bit in your patchkit has a lot
to do with aio.  It's same variant of aio done right (or at least less bad).
I suspect the right way to go ahead is to drop that bit for now (it's the
by far worst code in the patchkit anyway) and then we can redo it later to
not get abstractions wrong and duplicate lots of code but also replace the
aio code.  I don't expect you to do that alone, you'll probably need quite
a bit help from us FS and VM people.
