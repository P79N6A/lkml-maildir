Subject: 2.6.9-bb2 released.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/10/161

You can find all on 
http://www.user-mode-linux.org/~blaisorblade/.
Changes in both 2.6.9-bb2 against 2.6.9-bb1:
- updated most bugs of -bb1 which were reported
- fixed the Gentoo/NPTL issue, thanks to Bodo Stroesser (sorry for forgetting 
the credit on the changelog, but I'm leaving for one day in a few minutes):
but you must still compile Uml disabling CONFIG_MODE_TT (and obviously use the 
SKAS patch you find on the same site).
More info on the website "Changelog" page.
Distribution (like -bb1):
* the patch are also in split-out form, both web-browsable and tarballed.
* md5sums are available (to test with "md5sum -c *.md5").
Any testing and report is welcome.
Hope It Rocks!
