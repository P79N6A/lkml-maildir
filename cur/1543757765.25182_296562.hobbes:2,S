The 'enhanced acct data collection' patches that were added to
2-6-11-rc* tree still do collection of per process data.
CSA added those per-process data to per-aggregation ("job") data
structure at do_exit() time when a process termintes.

These data are now collected in 2.6.11-rc* code. Note that these data
are still per-process.

I totally agree with this! Actually that was what we have done. The data
collection part of code has been unified.

This sounds good. I am interested in learning how ELSA saves off
the per-process accounting data before the data got disposed. If
that scheme works for CSA, we would be very happy to adopt the
scheme. The current BSD scheme is very insufficient. The code is
very BSD centric and it provides no way to handle process-aggregation.
