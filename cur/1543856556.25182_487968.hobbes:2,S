We have code like this:
 static void tv_disconnect(struct usb_interface *interface)
{
	struct trancevibrator *dev;
	dev = usb_get_intfdata (interface);
	device_remove_file(&interface->dev, &dev_attr_speed);
	usb_set_intfdata(interface, NULL);
	usb_put_dev(dev->udev);
	kfree(dev);
}
This has a race:
CPU A				CPU B
open sysfs
					device_remove_file
					kfree
reading attr
We cannot do refcounting as sysfs doesn't export open/close. Therefore
we must be sure that device_remove_file() makes sure that sysfs will
leave a driver alone after the return of device_remove_file(). Currently
open will fail, but IO on an already opened file will work. The patch makes
sure it will fail with -ENODEV without calling into the driver, which may
indeed be already unloaded.
