A kiobuf simply provides that tuple plus the completion callback.  Stick a
bunch of them together and you've got a kiovec.  I don't see the advantage
of moving to simpler primatives if they don't provide needed
functionality.

Please tell me what you think the right interface is that provides a hook
on io completion and is asynchronous.
