Subject: [PATCH] remove truncate mapped BUG
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

It's time to remove truncate_complete_page's BUG_ON(page_mapped(page)):
it was there to give confidence in the new vm_truncate_count mechanism.
Earlier releases had no such check, and it wouldn't be at all helpful
if it ever bugged up file truncation on a production system - though
we don't know of any scenario in which that could happen now.
