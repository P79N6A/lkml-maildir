It is unfortunate that the same #define is used for signals and
for kernel interrupts. They are not related. As you noticed,i
SA_INTERRUPT with respect to signals is a no-op since it doesn't change
the nature of signals. However, with respect to IRQ handling within the
kernel, it does enable interrupts before your possible bottom-half ISR
is checked to see if it exists and executed.
See line 726 (about) in ../arch/i386/kernel/irq.c
