Hi Arnd,
Sorry I didn't comment on this when you sent it, I wasn't paying enough
attention. This patch confuses me, you say we should make sure we always
disable the master control when we're not inside spu_run, but I see
several exit paths where we leave the master run bit enabled - or maybe
I'm reading it wrong.
I think I've also seen it happen:
[root@localhost dma5]# ./put-test 
10963.13
[root@localhost dma5]# find /spu
/spu
[root@localhost dma5]# echo x > /proc/sysrq-trigger 
SysRq : Entering xmon
0:mon> ss
..
Stopped spu 06, was running (mfc_sr1: 0x32 runcntl: 0x1)
Stopped spu 07, was running (mfc_sr1: 0x32 runcntl: 0x1)
..
cheers
