Subject: RE: Bug in serial.c 
 Did something change between 2.4.2 & 2.4.3? Under 2.4.2 I did not have
to init the terminal (are you refering to the host or client side?) and
just accepted the defaults (9600, 8n1) which was fine for debug and
terminal I/O.  
My issue is with 2.4.2 it works with 2.4.3 (same .config) it does not.
So in my mind this is a bug of some type.....  :-) 
Which kernel are you using in your embedded project??

It is not broken. It is used all the while in our embeded systems.

Did you ever initialize the terminal? And I'm not talking about
baud-rate.
There is a termios structure of information necessary to configure a
terminal for I/O.

You refer to a BUG?  There isn't any of the kind you describe.
