Hmm, I could not get swap-over-ata-over-ethernet to break. Maybe I
should not have local / filesystem, because it allows kernel to get
rid of some memory pressure by dropping clean pages? Plus I guess
ata-over-ethernet has some significant advantages, as it works over
ethernet directly, not over IP.
