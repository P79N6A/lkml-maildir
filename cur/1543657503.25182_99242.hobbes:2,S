Hmmm.
uname -r tells you the base-kernel and what you have to write into
"EXTRAVERSION".
uname -v tells you if you have a SMP or UP-Kernel.
Then you "guess" what CPU-Type was used.
A start-point for this guess is "uname -m".
For a non-specific kernel i would guess i386 (=i386) or Pentium (=i586).
For i686 you can normaly use the CPU from "/proc/cpuinfo".
This way you SHOULD be able to create a module that matches (more or
less) for the kernel you want to load it in.
At least i had luck with this method so far. :-)
