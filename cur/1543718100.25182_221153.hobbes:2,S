Subject: i810fb cursor not working properly

I've noticed when the i810fb has been running under 2.6.5 that the 
cursor does not follow any keyboard commands (e.g. h/j/k/l in vi), but 
instead sits at its last known location.
However, if you start typing at a console or in Insert mode in vi, the 
cursor then moves with the text that you are typing.
Any ideas?
Thanks.
