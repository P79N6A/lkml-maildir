This is the start of the stable review cycle for the 2.6.23.9 release.
There are 29 patches in this series, all will be posted as a response to
this one.  If anyone has any issues with these being applied, please let
us know.  If anyone is a maintainer of the proper subsystem, and wants
to add a Signed-off-by: line to the patch, please respond with it.
I would especially like people who experienced the softlockup messages
in their kernel logs on 2.6.23.8 to test this series to make sure that
everything is now working properly.
These patches are sent out with a number of different people on the Cc:
line.  If you wish to be a reviewer, please email stable@kernel.org to
add your name to the list.  If you want to be off the reviewer list,
also email us.
Responses should be made by Friday, Nov 23, 00:00:00 UTC.  Anything
received after that time might be too late.
thanks,
greg k-h
