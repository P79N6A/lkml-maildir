As your machine is quite old, you would probably get a noticable speed
increase from mounting your filesystems with noatime, which is very
straightforward and shouldn't cause any problems - just edit
/etc/fstab, and add the option noatime after each disk partition, for
example, you might have something like:
/dev/hda2	/	ext3	defaults		1  1
which you can change to
/dev/hda2	/	ext3	defaults, noatime	1  1
This is a bit off-topic, but in my experience is about the best way to
increase performance on old, (and not so old), hardware, apart from
compiling a custom kernel.  Without noatime, every time you read a
file, the current date and time is written to the disk.  With noatime,
it's only recorded for a write.  Almost no programs use the access
time data.

Are you sure there isn't a correct slot that it should be in?  Most
motherboard manuals specify that the slots should be used in a
specific order.

I seriously doubt that a single RAM module should be installed in the
middle slot of three.  One of the end slotf would seem more likely.

It might have been disconnecting and reconnecting the RAM that
improved things, not the change of slot.  Try both end slots.
