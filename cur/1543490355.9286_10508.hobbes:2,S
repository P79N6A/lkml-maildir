Hi all,
I'm starting to feel quite confident after fixing some bugs,
rewamping depmod and getting very positive feedback on -pre2.
So, unless there are some last minute bugs cropping up,
I think this might be the last pre-release of modutils-2.2.2.
TODO:
- Check option suggestions received from Alon Ziv
- Wish that there are no serious problems on Alpha
- Wait for negative response on wordexp() (commented away in -pre3)
- Read test reports from YOU...
You should read the ChangeLog for more info.
Upgrade via cvs
	export CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@cvs.on.openprojects.net:/cvs/linux'
	cvs login	# Press <RETURN> at the prompt
	cvs -z3 checkout modutils
or via:
	<
http://www.pi.se/blox/modutils/>
       patches are available too...
Cheers,
Bjorn Ekwall <bj0rn@blox.se>
