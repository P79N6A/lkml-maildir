That would appear to require cycle detection, but it sounds like a
potential breakthrough usage of graph algorithms in the kernel.
(I've always been told graph algorithms would come back to haunt me.)
Or maybe not, deadlock detection has been done before.
A separate patch/feature/whatever for deadlock detection could do that
nicely, though. What I've presented here is meant only to flag far more
trivial errors with interrupt enablement/disablement than the full
deadlock detection problem.
