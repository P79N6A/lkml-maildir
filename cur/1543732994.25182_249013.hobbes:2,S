Is it? Pity. The nvidia module compiles fine with the non mm kernel but will 
not compile with the mm patches for me. So I guess I will have to join the 
nvidia forum to keep up with problems with the mm patch and nvidia... Thanks 
anyway for the person being off topic so I knew about the problem :)
It's been driving me nuts and I figured it was just me.
