err... It grew.  More like 50 now reiserfs is in there.  That's counting
real instances - it's not counting ones which are expanded multiple times
as "1".
It could be brought down to 20-25 with good results.  It seems to have
a 1/x distribution - double the reschedule count, halve the latency.
We're currently doing 300-400 usecs.
I think a 1.5-millisecond @ 500MHz kernel would be a good, maintainable
solution and a sensible compromise.
