Things like this...
+#ifdef CONFIG_VOYAGER
+       }
+#endif
*really* gross me out. One thing I intend to do at some point in
2.5 also is to split out the visws setup code to setup-visws.c or
the likes, as a, it's more or less unmaintained, and b, more
noisy ifdef's.
I'd be *so* much happier to see your patch with setup-voyager.c,
and a single ifdef in setup.c wrapping setup_voyager() or the likes.
On another related topic, the bootmem stuff in setup.c would be
so much nicer to be split into a bootmem.c imho.
This would also make sharing the x86 bootmem code with the x86-64
bootmem code a lot simpler.
comments ?
