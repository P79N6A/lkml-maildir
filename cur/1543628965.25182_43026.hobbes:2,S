The problem remains the same also going from phys to page, the problem
is that it's not a contigous mem_map and it choked when the phys addr
was above the max ram physaddr. The patch I posted a few days ago will
fix it (modulo for ununused ram space, but attempting to map into the
address space unused ram space is a bug in the first place).

I maybe wrong because I only had a short look at it so far, but the
"non-numa" is what I noticed too and that's what renders it not a very
interesting option IMHO. Most discontigmem needs numa too. If it cannot
handle numa it doesn't worth to add the complexity there, with numa we
must view those chunks differently, not linearly. Also there's nothing
magic that says mem_map must have a magical meaning, doesn't worth to
preserve the mem_map thing, virt_to_page is a much cleaner abstraction
than doing mem_map + pfn by hand.
