It means that you can define:
struct bla {
	int x;
};
struct blu {
	int x;
	float y;
};
and then use a pointer to a struct blu as if it was a pointer to a
struct bla. This trick is useful on very large project, where you want
to enhance some structures and test the code without recompiling every
code that uses such structures (somehow...).
Therefore, also ANSI C does not require any thing such as a ram, people
who implement a C compiler on a real machine should preserve the
ordering and padding of the fields in structures independantly of the
following fields.
