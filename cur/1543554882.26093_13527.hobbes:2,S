The full name of this operation is: "Decrement the value given
and test the result for equality with zero in one atomic operation".
So basically: 
#define dec_and_test(i) ( (--i) ? 0 : 1)
but atomically.
This is implemented in hardware for some archs and a required
operation for proper and fast refcounting.
