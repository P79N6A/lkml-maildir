Start by reading Documentation/HOWTO from a recent copy of the kernel source.

There's lots of good kernel related material to be found online. See
for example :
http://kernelnewbies.org/
http://janitor.kernelnewbies.org/
http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/
http://lwn.net/Kernel/
http://kerneltrap.org/
http://kerneltraffic.org/

Most people start out fixing small bugs, cleanups etc or by
implementing some small feature or driver that they need. There's no
fixed way.
