IMO, it's the reverse selection from sound to V4L that makes things
complicated.  I believe it's better to fix it as a normal dependency.
How about the patch below?

Fix kconfig dependency mess of fm801-tea575x
FM801-tea575x tuner has a reverse selection to V4L1 and this causes
dependency problem.  The patch simplifies the dependency with a
normal depend on VIDEO_V4L1.
