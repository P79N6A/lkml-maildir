I had no problems with the kernel-source.*.rpm approach.

The problem, that automation of such a task depend on various factors
(which
may be somewhat private):
- you have a linux-$VERSION:tar.bz2
- optionally, you have patches. And some distributions have *lots* of.
- you need a .config (and run `make oldconfig`).
You have to decide on each (independent if you build an RPM or a script)
of
them.
If you need regularly .rpm from ongoing development, you probably need
to figure out first which procedure is the best.
It's from a conceptual view different if you either have your kernel
source
and produce new kernels every other day for testing, etc. (then simple
scripts
are more than enough) or you produce a .rpm every other day to install
it and
keep it for months (for whatever reason).

A .spec file is a just set of "scripts", some meta-information and
produces
a container. And you have a package management at install time.
I can't decide if the more effort for the .rpm pays off for you - that
also
depends on factors like "geek value", "number of installations", ....
And that the reason for me to suggest to find a recent SuSEs
kernel.src.rpm
and start from there or find the one behind the "make rpm" thingy.

Yup, but these (usually) don't change at run-time. So I would put them
into
the .rpm like any other sym-link (or delete and create them in the
pre-rm and
post-install scripts if it's not fixed at rpm-build-time).

Sorry, the correct sym-links. Since I have no experience with recent
SuSE,
I didn't know that's the same as in the RedHat world (but they point
somewhere else).
