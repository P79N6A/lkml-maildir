As we've seen elsewhere in this thread, things break
when you go above 0xffff anyway. So 128 KiB of RAM
should do the job. With a 4-digit PID, 20000 bytes
would be enough.
Supposing you fix rwsem counts and /proc inodes and so on,
a large machine could handle 4 million objects easily.
A small machine has far, far, less need to support that.

That's too unwieldy for the users, it breaks glibc,
and you'll still hit the problems after wrap-around.
Besides, Linus vetoed this a year or two ago.
Reducing the dangers of a small PID space allows for
just the opposite size change, which is much nicer for
the users.
