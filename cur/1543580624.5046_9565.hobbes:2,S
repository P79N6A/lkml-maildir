And in terms of casual usage, I've nearly always used 'disk' in
reference to media that can be mounted read-write, and 'disc' to media
that can only be mounted read-only.
More technically, 'disc' is a single media layer (usually a CD-ROM) and
'disk' is a removable media device with a protective casing.
Non-removable storage are generally refered to as 'drives'.
Yes, it's confusing.
