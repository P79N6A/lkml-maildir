I second this wholeheartedly. And I believe there are still more
motivations for providing asynchronous interfaces for all I/O in
the realm of assisting the userland:
(1) It would simplify the ways applications have and the kernel
	overhead of responding to user input while I/O is in progress.
(2) It would provide a more efficient way to do M:N threading than
	watchdogs and nonblocking poll/select in itimers.
Cheers,
Bill
