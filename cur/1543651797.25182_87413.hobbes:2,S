Diff between 2.4.20pre11aa1 and 2.4.20rc1aa1:
Only in 2.4.20rc1aa1: 00_elevator-backmerge-1
	Allow merging at the end when latency is zero.
Only in 2.4.20pre11aa1: 00_extraversion-11
Only in 2.4.20rc1aa1: 00_extraversion-12
	Rediffed.
Only in 2.4.20pre11aa1: 00_module-locking-fix-1
Only in 2.4.20rc1aa1: 00_module-locking-fix-2
	Readd the BKL too, to serialize against module callbacks
	(thanks to Andrew for noticing).
Only in 2.4.20pre11aa1: 00_reduce-module-races-1
Only in 2.4.20rc1aa1: 20_reduce-module-races-1
	Rename.
Only in 2.4.20pre11aa1: 08_qlogicfc-template-aa-4
Only in 2.4.20rc1aa1: 08_qlogicfc-template-aa-5
	Fix qlogic compilation.
Only in 2.4.20pre11aa1: 20_sched-o1-fixes-5
Only in 2.4.20rc1aa1: 20_sched-o1-fixes-8
	Further o1 sched fixes and improvements (on all the benchmarks).
Only in 2.4.20pre11aa1: 9900_aio-12.gz
Only in 2.4.20rc1aa1: 9900_aio-13.gz
	Further fixes, now fully functional with fs and rawio.
	More optimizations coming soon.
Only in 2.4.20pre11aa1: 9910_shm-largepage-5.gz
Only in 2.4.20rc1aa1: 9910_shm-largepage-6.gz
	Fixed, apparently ipc shm just couldn't use largepages at all in the
	original version (VM_BIGPAGE would never be set in the vma so it was
	only a fake that forbidden the vm to touch the SGA possibly showing
	improvements with bad VM algorithms, equivalent to mlock/SHM_LOCK), now
	ipcshm will use real large tlb entries too if the alignment/size
	suggested by userspace is correct (same as in shmfs).
Only in 2.4.20pre11aa1: 9920_kgdb-3.gz
Only in 2.4.20rc1aa1: 9920_kgdb-4.gz
	Allow only the admin to invoke kgdb (noticed by Andrew).
Only in 2.4.20rc1aa1: 9941_ocfs-20021012.gz
Only in 2.4.20rc1aa1: 9942_ocfs-compile-1
	Updated to a recent snapshot.
