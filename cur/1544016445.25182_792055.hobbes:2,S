Calling the ISR twice isn't a problem, is it?  We're talking about
PCI interrupts, which are shareable, so ISRs have to handle being
called extra times.
There's still the problem that the core will disable an IRQ if we
take it too many times without any ISR that cares about it.  But that's
a core issue, not an ISR issue.
