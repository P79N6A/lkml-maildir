Boot with the command line option

Unless you have more than one SCSI channel, or devices outside the SCSI Id 
range 0-7, in which case read README.aic7xxx and alter appropriately.
If that fixes it, then complain bitterly that tagged queueing was enabled by 
default so close to the release of 2.2, and hope that it gets disabled again 
before lots more people get bitten by it.
Defaulting to tagged queueing is a reasonable plan for 2.3, but IMHO we need
time to make the device blacklist fairly comprehensive before doing it in a
release kernel.
