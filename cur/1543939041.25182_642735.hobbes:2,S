I can live with that - if anything, a force-loaded GPL module deserves to lose
even more than a non-GPL module built against the current kernel.  Quite
frankly, given that one of the reasons given for not liking closed modules is
"it's not maintainable", you'd *expect* that the infrastructure for allowing
a force-load of a module would have been thrown out entirely - is there anything
more unmaintainable than a module you *know* was built against different headers
and thus is using the wrong offsets for things?
