FYI I am also getting "Unlink of SHM id ?????? failed (-1)" with
2.3.99p3. It happens at random moments under XFree86-4.0 and XFree86
dies. I get the following error from gnome-name-server around the same
time of the Unlink failed messages:
 gnome-name-server[338]: input condition is: 0x10, exiting
Will try out mode=511 now to see if it helps....
