	To be honest, I'd like to see more delayed allocation
infrastructure in the VFS itself.  XFS has to maintain an entire chunk
of state for it, and I suspect ext4 will as well.  I'd love to get
delayed allocation into OCFS2 someday.  Why not move to where we can
share the in-memory accounting code?
	Now, we'd probably want to start by prototyping it in ext4
directly.  Once it's stable as a filesystem feature, we can see where
XFS and ext4 overlap, etc, etc.  But I'd like to keep a more generic
direction in mind.
