Oh, ok.  I'll just go back to writing code instead of arguing...

No, but one could argue that it should :)

Then, when you want to access it, a simple 'modprobe floppy' would work
for you, right?
Anyway, I'm not going to drag this thread out anymore.  If you want to
use devfs, do it.  Just realize that it is an obsolete kernel feature
and is marked for probable removal in 2.7.  It also has known bad
problems that could cause your machine to lock up.  Use it at your own
risk, you have been warned...
