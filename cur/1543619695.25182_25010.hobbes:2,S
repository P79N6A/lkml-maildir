Do I have to understand that you're using : "vga=ask scan" ?
this can't work, cause it doesn't mean anything.
The syntax is "vga=ask" _or_ "vga=scan"
Or, if you prefer, 'ask' is a special scan code you can put, that will ask 
you (at boot time) which one you want (you'll get a list of scancode 
supported by your graphic card to choose from)
best wishes,
Thomas
