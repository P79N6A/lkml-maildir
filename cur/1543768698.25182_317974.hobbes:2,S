This in fact was the reason that we added lock_cpu_hotplug in sched_setaffinity.
Also guarantee_online_cpus seems to be accessing cpu_online_map with preemption 
enabled (& no hotplug lock taken). This is highly not recommended.

I agree that taking the hotplug lock seems reasonable here.

Given the fact that CPU/Memory hotplug and cpuset operation may
be infrequent events, this will probably be not a concern.
