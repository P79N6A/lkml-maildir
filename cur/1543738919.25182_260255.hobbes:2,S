I can't see the harm in sending it after 2.6.9 if it defaults
to off (maybe also make it CONFIG_NUMA).
OTOH, if it is going to be painful to remove later on, then
maybe leave it local to your tree.
It's true that I have something a bit more sophisticated in
the pipe, but it is going to be an uphill battle to get it
and everything it depends on merged - so don't count on it for
2.6.10 :P
