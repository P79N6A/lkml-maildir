Subject: xmm2 - monitor Linux MM active/inactive lists graphically
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/10/24/6

New version is out and can be found at the same URL:
<URL:
http://linux.inet.hr/>
As Linus' MM lost inactive dirty/clean lists in favour of just one
inactive list, the application needed to be modified to support that.
You can still continue to use the older one for kernels <= 2.4.9
and/or Alan's (-ac) kernels, which continued to use older Rik's VM
system.
Enjoy and, as usual, all comments welcome!

P.S. BTW, 2.4.13 still has very unoptimal writeout performance and
     andrea@suse.de is redirected to /dev/null. <g>
