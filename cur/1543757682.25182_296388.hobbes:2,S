Also, one of the things mentioned in that thread is that whenever a driver 
is waiting on I/O from a piece of hardware, there should always be some 
timeout code.  Is that the root of the permanent D state?  Is it always a 
process waiting on a piece of hardware that should be eventually timing out, 
except the timeout code isn't there?
