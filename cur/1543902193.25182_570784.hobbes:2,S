It would be okay to switch the "hibernated" kernel in order to
e.g. initiate a suspend to ram provided that everything is done
atomically with interrupts off, for instance.  It is not clear, though,
that it is possible to suspend to ram atomically like that.
There is also the question of what state the devices will be in when
switching back from the "save image" kernel to the "hibernated" kernel.
