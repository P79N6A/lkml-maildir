Hmpf.  I'll try the clock=tsc switch next.  I did boot using the clock=pit 
switch and the clock was normal...but I had also changed the append statement 
acpi=on to acpi=off as well.  I'll set it back to "on" and try "clock=tsc" in 
combination.
My bios is very limited.  This is a rather old laptop and there is just not a 
lot I can do.  I'll check it one more time as I reboot.
Thanks for the help.
