It's difficult, but perhaps providing a link to the latest "stable team" 
release in addition to Linus's release would solve the problem.
At least then you can do what Nick wanted (assuming the kernel.org FAQ gets 
fixed) and download the "patch" for 2.6.14.5, say, revert it, then apply 
Linus's latest and greatest (one or more times as required).
Bloats the front page though. I think as long as something is documented 
properly it doesn't really matter. Currently it isn't.
