Note that in some cases, you have different architectures having different 
sizes, and it could potentially be the case that one architecture has a 
1-byte thing, and another has a 2-byte thing.
It's unlikely to be an issue for single-byte cases, but it definitely 
happens for other equivalent things (ie "get_user()" often has 2 vs 4-byte 
accesses, and obviously the 4- vs 8-byte thing through 32/64-bit values 
depending on the size of the machine).
So at least in _theory_ it's quite possible that a single-byte access can 
make sense, simply because the size might depend on a config option.
