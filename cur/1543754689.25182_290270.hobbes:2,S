:) So far my little grkernsec module hasn't hit any bumps like that;
though so far I haven't copied much of spender's code.  I'm sure the
chroot() restrictions will easily be make for a loadable module.
At this point, I should be making more important design decisions.  For
example, why am I still doing this?  Isn't there something better for me
to do than clone LSM and GrSecurity, attempt (*cough*) to improve on the
original designs, and then harass kernel devs about problems I'm having
with things that are just meant to be toys for me anyway?
