i'd like to force all interrupts to happen on just one processor, or
rather more precisely, to stop them from happening on one processor
(in a dual system, these are equivalent).
can this be done right now ? if not, how hard would it be ? i want to
use the pset patches, bind a thread to a processor, and stop all 
interrupt activity on that processor. well, i think i do :)
