I think that's another problem --- when RAID-5 is operating in degraded
mode, the machine must not crash or volume will be damaged (sectors
that were not written may be damaged this way). Did anybody develop some
method to care about this (i.e. something like journaling on raid)? What
do hardware RAID controllers do in this situation?

I can't because mdadm is on that volume ... I solved it by booting from
floppy and editing raid superblocks with disk hexeditor but not every user
wants to do it; there should be at least kernel boot parameter for it.

I meant mechanical failure which is more common. Of course --- everything
can happen in case of electrical failure in disk/controller/bus/mainboard
...
