Well, Jörg's questions, although ridiculously exaggerated and quixotic,
show a general problem in Linux: documentation is constantly outdated,
missing, and not part of the kernel package.
If Linux were based in Utopia, it would ship with a complete set of
kernel-related manual pages and HOWTOs.
I appreciate the efforts of the old and new man-pages maintainers, and I
know the problems in motivation when writing documentation and keeping
it up to date distracts people from writing code -- but those people
know their code best.

And that is the key problem. magazine here, conference there, talk
(perhaps only slides available) somewhere else -- a manual that was in
/usr/src/linux/Documentation might make a real difference. Even a
commented link list in Documentation/* might be a good starting point.
Patrick Mochel added some bits three years ago, but they were internals
and thus a bit less interesting.
