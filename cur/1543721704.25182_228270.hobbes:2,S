Yep. I'm not interested in the file contents, but in behavior of poll
on that file (which fires when device is plugged or unplugged).
Only thing which is at least simillar is dnotify on
/sys/bus/usb/devices, but as dnotify needs (preferrably RT) signal, it
is not trivial to use it from libraries due to problems with allocating
unused RT signal (and then you need some pipe to deliver notifications
from signal handler to "safe" process context).
Or do I miss some nice and simple interface which can be used for
notifications about newly plugged (USB) devices?
