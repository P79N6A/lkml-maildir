I have no objections.

But I don't want to carry the patch in -mm - I'm not well set up for
large file movement patches and they're a pita to carry.
git does a good job of this and perhaps we can persuade Al to carry
this patch in the vfs tree.  Otherwise I'd suggest that you send it in
to Linus lateish in the 2.6.29-rc1 merge window.  Please remember to cc
me on that email.
