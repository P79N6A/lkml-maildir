   2.88?
   From this distributer's point of view, a 2.88mb boot image would be
   the promised land;   I'm still trying to fit everything on a 1.44mb
   boot image so people can boot off a floppy as well as off the CD. A
   2.88 boot image would give me another meg and a half for kernel
   and/or pcmcia+ethernet lkms, which would probably solve my disk
   space woes for another 2 years (3 more major releases, each adding
   100+k to the basic kernel size, plus another 100+k per version for
   lkms.)     But if I did that, I'd be screwed on machines that don't
   allow CD booting (which I may be anyway when I rev Mastodon from
   a 2.0.28 kernel to 2.4/3.0 :-()
