I'd have thought that a more appropriate communication mechanism would be
something which uses a file descriptor: a pipe, or a /dev node or whatever.
That way, the endpoints are more tightly defined and the
daemon-didnt-send-quit problem gets solved.  In fact, the quit message
might become unneeded: just use close()?
