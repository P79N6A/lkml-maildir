Hmm, with a bit more thought I think that does indeed DTRT. Because, if
the cpu belongs to a disjoint cpuset, the highest sd (with
load-balancing enabled) would be that. Right?
[ Just a bit of a shame we have all cgroups represented on each cpu. ]
Also, might be a nice idea to split the daemon up if there are indeed
disjoint sets - currently there is only a single daemon which touches
the whole system.
