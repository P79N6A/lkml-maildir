FYI.  The standard instructions:
ldr = load register
str = store register
The new (ARM architecture v6 and above) atomic instructions:
ldrex = load register exclusive
strex = store register exclusive
Previous architecture versions only have the 32-bit and 8 bit
unconditional swap instructions.  Luckily they're unlikely to be
used for SMP in the field.
