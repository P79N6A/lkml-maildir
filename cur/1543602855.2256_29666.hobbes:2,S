Hi,
I have a dual pentium III 550Mhz box and a parallel port ZIP-plus drive.
Under 2.2.19 SMP, with imm compiled as a module, everything works fine.
With 2.4.9-ac16 (plus the swapoff patch) SMP, with imm compiled as a
module I get a hard lock when I load the module.  It successfully
determines which mode to use (EPP-32 bit) but, at the point where it
probes, everything dies.
The same kernel 2.4.9-ac16 compiled for uniprocessor with imm compiled
as a module also works fine.
A quick diff of the 2.2.19 imm source-code and the 2.4.9-ac16 imm
source-code reveals that the only major difference is the introduction
of:
spin_unlock_irq(&io_request_lock);
and
spin_lock_irq(&io_request_lock);
in various places.
The parallel port code is compiled into the kernel at build time.
That's all the info I have right now, any thoughts/suggestions/more info
required?
Thanks,
Dan.
