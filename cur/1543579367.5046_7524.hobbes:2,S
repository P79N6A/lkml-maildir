Yes, PPPoE works fine with 2.4.0. PLEASE read
$YOUR_KERNEL_SOURCE/Documentation/CHANGES and setup your alias
correctly.
For example (my System):
/etc/modules.conf:
---------------cut-----------------
# Ok, here we start with 2.4.x stuff !
# LVM 0.9
alias alias block-major-58      lvm-mod
alias char-major-109            lvm-mod
#CPU
alias char-major-10-184 microcode
#PPP
alias char-major-108    ppp_generic
alias /dev/ppp          ppp_generic
alias tty-ldisc-3       ppp_async
alias tty-ldisc-14      ppp_synctty
alias ppp-compress-21   bsd_comp
alias ppp-compress-24   ppp_deflate
alias ppp-compress-26   ppp_deflate
#end 2.4.0
---------------cut--------------------
