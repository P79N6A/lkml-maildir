Most likely the problem is CONFIG_I2C=m and the fact that FB_RADEON_I2C
is a bool.
I don't know whether there's a better way to express this, but something 
like the following is required:
--- linux-2.6.3-rc4/drivers/video/Kconfig.old	2004-02-17 21:00:24.000000000 +0100
+++ linux-2.6.3-rc4/drivers/video/Kconfig	2004-02-17 21:01:53.000000000 +0100
