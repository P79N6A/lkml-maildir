Sorry about that. The reason for this submission is to make the listxattr
code in fs/xattr.c a little cleaner (as well as to clean up some code in
Unionfs.)
Currently, Unionfs has vfs_listxattr defined in its code. I think that's
very ugly, and I'd like to see it (re)moved. The logical place to put it, is
along side of all the other vfs_*xattr functions. Overall, I think this
patch is benefitial for both kernel.org kernel and Unionfs.
