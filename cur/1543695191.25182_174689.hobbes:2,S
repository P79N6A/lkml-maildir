As reported earlier, this still fails to boot on my P-II (to recap,
pre6, pre7 and pre8 fail to boot - no messages after Uncompressing
kernel).
Reverting the ACPI changes in pre6 fixes it - note that I have ACPI
turned off in the config, so the CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT thing is causing the
problem, and it seems to be impossible to compile a kernel without it.
