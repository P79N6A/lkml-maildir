lvm can do linear and raid0 (striping in two or more disks), and it supports
live snapshotting of the logical volume (but it's a not a persistent snapshot
at the moment so you lose its data when you reboot). It's still useful for
backups of a raw logical volume though. Checkpoint and block, snapshot, unblock
and then backup from the snapshot and then drop the snapshot when the backup
completes.
