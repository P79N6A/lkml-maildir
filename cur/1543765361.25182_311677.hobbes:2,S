Obviously I don't.  However that's hardly an argument for providing
even less information.
And stat() btw pretty much covers what information there is to present
for network filesystems and archives, since there _is_ a real
filesystem where the information originated from (though sometimes
it's not a UNIX type of filesystem, in which case there has to be some
mapping of the info).
