ok. I'd expect there to be a whole lot of bugs triggered in this area. 
We have to shape it in a way that puts the most useful bits to the head 
and the riskiest bits to the end, so that we can do reverts in a 
sensible and least destructive way - if the need arises.

ok, i thought you might have had some higher rationale too. Frankly, 
WBINVD wont ever go away from the x86 instruction set, and while i am 
very symphathetic to rt and latency issues, it's still a risky change in 
a historically fragile area of code.
What is very real though are the hard limitations of MTRRs. So i'd 
rather first like to see a clean PAT approach (which all other modern 
OSs have already migrated to in the past 10 years), with all the 
structural cleanups and bugfixes you did as well, which would allow us 
to phase out MTRR use (of the DRM drivers, etc.), and _then_ layer an 
(optional) cflush approach basically as the final step. Right now cflush 
is mixed inextractably into the CPA patchset. WBINVD latency is really 
the last of our problems here.

but that is plain stupid. If it can be WC mapped, why not map it WB and 
use cflush when updating memory? That gives cache-coherency on demand 
_and_ true read side caching - so it's faster as well. Modern GX cards 
can take that just fine. The best of both worlds. Unconditional WC is 
way overrated.

as i see it, the utility of PAT comes from going away from MTRRs, and 
the resulting flexibility it gives system designers to shape memory and 
IO BARs.

yes, 'quite slow or corrupt data' is what i meant:

i expect usage to not change in pattern. ioremap()ping on the fly is not 
too smart.

thanks. I've test-merged the PAT patchset from Venki/Suresh to have a 
look, and to me the most logical way to layer these changes would be:
 - PAT
 - non-cflush bits of CPA
 - cflush bits of CPA
 - GBPAGES
hm?
