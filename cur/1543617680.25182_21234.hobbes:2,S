I meant that I  had run fsck one week ago, because the filesystem was
corrupt (but this was my fault).
At that same time (but after the fsck) I decided to switch to kernel 2.4.17.
But this shouldn't cause such errors with file-loss...
I don't know if it is save for me to run 2.4.17. For now I switched back to
2.4.10.
Tomorrow I'll start an new backup of the data and then try again the.17.
If the error occurs again, I'll post again.... :-)
