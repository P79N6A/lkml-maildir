Subject: [no patch] Remove more double inclusions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
Pipes for the world...
	find . -type f -iname "*.[ch]" -print0 | \
	xargs -0 grep -P '#\s*include' /dev/null | \
	sort | \
	uniq -c | \
	sort -gr | \
	less -MSi
turns up all the double-inclusions. Needs someone to review, because odd 
things like
	/* meh */
	#if defined(ABC)
	#	include "foo.h"
	#elif defined(DEF)
	#	include "foo.h"
	#else
	#	whatever
	#endif
are done. Or, that <foo.h> actually changes its meaning depending on a 
macro...
	/* ugly */
	#define FOO expand_me
	#include <foo.h>
	#undef FOO
	#define FOO something_else
	#include <foo.h>
	#undef FOO
happy hunting.
	Jan
