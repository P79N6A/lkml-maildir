Brad,
My problem is one of the infamous nforce2 hardlockups.  You don't get any
kernel panic or anything that useful.  The system just locks up completely
and has to be manually reset.
The problem is known to associate with IDE activity and is thought (as far
as I know) to originate somewhere in the IDE driver.
Cheers,
Ross

Hmm, interesting. The patches I submitted were strictly
for IDE/ATA133 improvements, apparently your problems don't
lie there.  I'd assume this was a kernel panic you had, any
output available that would tell you where it paniced ?
