What parameter settings do you use in the X driver? If you have
SHMConfig enabled, you can run "synclient -l" to find out. Does
increasing MaxTapTime help?

Probably because 2.6.10 didn't have the kernel ALPS driver, so you got
whatever features the firmware emulates in its PS/2 compatibility
mode. With the kernel ALPS driver, the touchpad is put into "raw"
mode, so you instead get whatever features the kernel or the X driver
implements.

The problem is that mousedev.c doesn't implement "tap and drag"
emulation, so all Synaptics and ALPS touchpads that have firmware
support for dragging have seen a regression compared to a 2.4 kernel.
(For synaptics, the regression happened at ~2.5.7x, for ALPS it
happened at 2.6.11.)
The situation is the same with scroll emulation that some touchpads do
in firmware.
