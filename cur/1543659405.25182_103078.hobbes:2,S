Hi,
I am not sure this is the right place for such a question - we have a Compaq 
gs80 box (8-way alpha) which is currently running tru64 - I am considering 
switching it over to Linux in the near future. How stable is Linux on these 
boxes? Has it been done before? How well does it scale? If anyone has any 
experiences, please email me.
Thank you,
Ognen
