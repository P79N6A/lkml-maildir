I was looking for the same thing a few weeks ago :-)
Finding it is one problem.  Compiling it is another :-)

PS: Personally, what you (and me too) are trying to do is best defined as
    a switch.  Putting a wavelan adapter and a 10M ethernet (or worse, 100M)
    in promisc mode could be a Very Bad Thing (tm).  I was previously using
    weird proxy arp ethernet tricks, but that's just ugly.
