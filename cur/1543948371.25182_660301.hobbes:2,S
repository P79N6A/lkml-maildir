I disagree, the config option is indeed static but so is the NUMA topology 
of the machine.  It represents the maximum number of page reclaim threads 
that should be allowed for that specific topology; a maximum should not 
need to be redefined with yet another sysctl and should remain independent 
of various workloads.
However, I would recommend adding the word "MAX" to the config option.
