After looking at vfb.c again, it seems the default is for vfb to be
enabled and you have to actively disable vfb either with
video=vfb:disable or video=vfb:off
I have to change this behavior. In the meantime, try one of the above
options.
(I was also under the impression that vfb must be explicitly enabled
with a boot option...I remember now, the option vfb_enable defaults to
false when compiled as a module, and to true if compiled statically.)
