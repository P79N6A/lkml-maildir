I'm stupid - first I was certains that your description is wrong, I 
started a long mail, but the I confused myself and accepted your 
description.
Your description can't be correct: The store to q->lock_ptr can't 
overwrite ar.bspstore. As long as q->lock_ptr is not NULL, unqueue_me 
will spin and prevent a race. But the other race seems to be possible_ 
q->lock_ptr is set to NULL early, and then the spin_unlock_irqrestore() 
in __wake_up could overwrite ar.bspstore.
