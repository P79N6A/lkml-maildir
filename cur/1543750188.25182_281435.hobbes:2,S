More likely it is a core problem. I'm still stomping 400nS timing
violations and you don't have all of those let alone the other locking
stuff. Nor are we anywhere remotely near fixing them. Blaming the host
driver at this point seems a bit early for any IDE bug.
There certainly are corner cases where APIC timing for PIII especially
would radically change behaviour. We also exercise IRQ masking far
harder than any other driver with IDE.
