I think that the only way shared access could work is if different
hosts controlled different slices of the device.  The hosts would have
to some-how negotiate and record who was managing which bit.  It is
quite appropriate that this information be stored on the raid array,
and quite possibly in a superblock.  But I think that this is a
sufficiently major departure from how md/raid normally works that I
would want it to go in a secondary superblock.
There is 60K free at the end of each device on an MD array.  Whoever
was implementing this scheme could just have a flag in the main
superblock to say "there is a secondary superblock" and then read the
info about who owns what from somewhere in that extra 60K
So in short, I think the metadata needed for this sort of thing is
sufficiently large and sufficiently unknown that I wouldn't make any
allowance for it in the primary superblock.
Does that sound reasonable?
