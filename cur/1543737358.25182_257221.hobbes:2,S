I've started on a merged fbdev and DRM driver model. 
It doesn't work yet but here's what the modules look like:
Module                  Size  Used by
fbcon                  38080  0
radeon                123598  1
fb                     34344  2 fbcon,radeon
drm                    59044  1 radeon
fbcon and fb modules are almost unmodified from the kernel source.
radeonfb and radeondrm have been merged into a single driver. The
merged driver uses both the drm and fb modules as libraries. It wasn't
possible to build this model until drm supported drm-core.
The radeon and fb modules will get smaller, I'm just beginning to use
the delete key on them. There is still a lot of duplicated code inside
the radeon driver.
In this model a non-drm, fb only driver like cyber2000 could load only
the fb and fbcon modules. I need to do some work rearranging generic
library support functions to allow this.
This is the next phase in the work described in this email:
