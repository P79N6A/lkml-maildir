Here its alot worse, just playing an ogg with ogg123 even without
anything reniced (X is 0), just pressing a link in konqueror can make
audio skip (ogg123 fails to fill the alsa buffer, and thus it skips).
this is something that simply does not happen for me on vanilla,
staircase or SD.
it just doesent seem to work properly..
