This should (IMO) be done anyway; the manager is responsible for
implementing POSIX signal semantics (unless someone truly prefers the
kludge of `signal-one process groups'... yuck.) [*]
Anyhow, any thread in the program that calls getpid() should get the
original task's pid--- that's what POSIX says.  So, when we use pthreads
compatibility, if I write the result of getpid() somewhere, the task that
gets this signal should know what to do with it.  And even gettid()
shouldn't really map to the getpid() syscall; it should access
thread-specific memory.  So the thread may be `retasked' (ie moved to a
different kernel task) without its knowledge.

So?
The thread will do the above sequence when it's detached.  (Sure, whoever
detaches it will need a way to tell it to go away, but it's doable.
Threads communicate all the time anyway...  Just send it an RT signal with
enough data that it knows what to do now.)

Well, if the thread is detached, I see no reason to keep it in the
manager's list anymore.  Or am I wrong?
