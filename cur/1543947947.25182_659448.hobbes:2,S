I can't seem to get these warnings in Debian gcc 4.2.3-1.  But the code is
broken alright.  I will send in a fix in a short while, as it will take a
small while to make sure there is nothing else wrong before I send in the
fix.   I have to figure out how the heck that got past the testing in the
first place, as well...
