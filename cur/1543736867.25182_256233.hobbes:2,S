This isn't an oops, it's a state transition warning.  Apparently the
customary attempt to cancel the commands failed.  This is really only a
warning and will probably go away eventually (we'll just silently fail
the transition attempt).

No, the patch is wrong.  we do forget first to make the host
inaccessible from above then cancel the outstanding commands.
The key to the solution of this problem is to know what USB is trying to
do with the dead device.  SCSI is trying to be polite and explicitly
kill the outstanding commands before it removes the HBA.  Presumably USB
is returning something that says this can't be done so the EH gets all
the way up to offlining.
Also, please at least cc linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org on SCSI problems.
Thanks,
James
