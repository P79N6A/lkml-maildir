1.7.1.1->1.7.1.2, I assume?

Aha, so that's why my `mergetree' script (which basically is some directory
recursion around plain RCS merge, with additional support for hardlinking
identical files) works better than CVS, when I merge e.g. linux-2.5.64 and
linux-m68k-2.5.63 into linux-m68k-2.5.64. It always uses the latest common
ancestor (linux-2.5.63)...
