I'm certainly seeing burst/pause/burst/pause behaviour. I wasn't sure which
log to check, but there aren't any timeouts seen by grep'ing through
/var/log/*
On the 2.0.36 machine (MACHINE 1) /sbin/ifconfig gives (eth1 to the adsl
modem. they're both PCI Ne2k)
On the receiving machine (MACHINE 2) the number of errors/frame increases
quite steadily.
cheers
