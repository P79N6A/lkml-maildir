It pulls the latest git release plus any extra commits that have been made
since, if any.   Now, if you have a specific reason to test a -gitX
release you can simply lookup which commit corresponds to the -gitX
release and check it out of the git repository and build it.   Actually, I
just posted a script that lets you check out a build by -gitX name instead
of having to manually lookup the corresponding commit id.

There are cases where using the -gitX release helps a bit.  But there's
nothing magic about a -gitX release, it's just a collection of whatever
commits existed when the timed build procedure ran.
Using git you get the choice of using -gitX builds or tracking directly
from the most recent commit as the situation demands.   Therefore if Linus
commits a fix beyond the latest -gitX release you happen to need, you're
good to go.  If you want to track the latest -gitX release, you can do
that with git too.
