Subject: possible spinlock optimizations

I think there are 2 possible optimizations for spinlocks:
1) spin_lock_irq(): What about enabling interrupts while spinning?
CPU1 owns the spinlock, ie it runs with disabled interrupts.
Now CPU2 tries to acquire the spinlock, it fails and it starts to spin.
- while spinning, there are no atomicity requirements.
- it would improve the interrupt responsiveness. Currently, both CPU's are
waiting/running with disabled interrupts.
- the change only affects the "slow path", it doesn't slow down the normal
case.
I'm only talking about spin_lock_irq(), obviously this is impossible for
spin_lock_irqsave().
2) Have you read this note about W2K spinlock?
http://www.numega.com/drivercentral/resources/spinlocks.shtml
They claim their implementation has better SMP memory bus characteristics.
Has anyone tried to implement something like this?
