Compare 'depmod -V' from your user login prompt to
'depmod -V' when logged in (or 'su') as root.
There shouldn't be these depmod errors, and I've seen at least one
case of root's depmod being the old modutils one instead of
the one from module-init-tools (this being a $PATH issue).

| No module mptbase found for kernel 2.6.0-test7
Someone else also reported this problem with mptbase and mkinitrd....
I'll look at the mkinitrd script to see if anything pokes me in the eye.
