Does anyone know why the system calls having to do with sockets were
multiplexed together into 'socketcall'?  This seems kind of noxious.
I can't seem to find any comments about it, but I have the feeling that it was
done to save on syscall entries.  Is this true?  Is there some reason why
linux is limited to ~256 syscalls?
Thanks for any hints,
--Mike
