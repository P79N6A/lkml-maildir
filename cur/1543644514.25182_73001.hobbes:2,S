Not so -- we do so care! I get the same behavior on 2.4.19-ac4. 
I ran hdparm -Y /dev/hdd on an IBM 120GB DeskStar. The specs sheet 
recommends no more than 8 hours of power-on a day, so I use it as a backup 
drive. The machine it's on is never turned off.
Clarification: is it the case that hdparm -Y (sleep) will cool the drive 
off better than hdparm -y (suspend)?
I read somewhere that -Y only works on unmounted drives. This appears to 
be false. Comments?
Cheers,
Peter
