Yes.
I think that if you remove everything that is not used inside the kernel,
the rest fits problemless into 0..255.

True. In the long run more may be needed. (If we really want to assign
a different keycode to each possible picture on a key.)
I would be happy if we could pass smoothly from old to new - no new
ioctls for 2.6.0 yet, a kbd package that only changes the NR_KEYS define,
and later worry about whether we really need lots of keycodes.
Everything we add will never go away, so we must be slow in adding.
