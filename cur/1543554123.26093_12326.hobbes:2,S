This touches the places where I saw hangs, so I'm testing.
Too soon to have statistics, but with this patch I have
observed no more failures to wake (what I referred  to as
"soft hangs").
I have seen a total I/O lockup, but no info escapes to
indicate its source. No NMI wakeup available, maybe I should
rig a pushbutton.
