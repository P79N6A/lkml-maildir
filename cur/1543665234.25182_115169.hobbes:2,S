I'm getting "unable to handle kernel NULL Pointer dereference at virtual
address 00000354" (actual address varies).
This happens only with kernels I have compiled in the last few hours -
kernels made last night boot just fine (as far as I can tell the only
differences are in SCSI and Parport).
Any clues?
Geordie.
