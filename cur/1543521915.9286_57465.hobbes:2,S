Hmm.. This actually looks like a bug that has been there forever. I don't
know why it hasn't shown itself with the old code, because it looks like
it was there since day 1.
Try changing drivers/pcmcia/cs.c, alloc_io_space(), line 746 or so, which
looks like
	if ((*base & ~(align-1)) {
		..
to
	if (align && (*base & (align-1)) {
and see if that makes it work for you.

It is. The old code was a "let's make this work" with not much design, and
definitely broken for CardBus devices.
The new code has a clearer design, but is new. New code always has bugs,
and I'm trying to track them down. In this case, it was the OLD code that
had bugs, but it looks like something else hid the bug when used with
other old kernels.

I appreciate bug reports, but keep the profanity down.
If you don't want new features, then stay at a 2.2.x kernel. Forever.
If you want Linux to become a better system, and you want to take
advantage of new improvements, then help by testing (and coding if you
can), and by making bug-reports.
David Hinds agrees with you. He'd rather not touch the PCMCIA subsystem,
because the old one works, and is held together with years of duct-tape,
added to make it work. 
It may actually be that for 2.4.x I'll have to split off the new code and
revert to the old code as a backup option, but I _wanted_ to break things
in order to find the breakage. In order to get bug-reports, and in order
to make people aware that the thing is changing to more seamlessly support
CardBus as a real PCI subsystem rather than as an afterthought.
So keep your temper, and send me bug-reports. Tell me if the above fix
makes any difference, and I'll figure out why the hell it was EVER
supposed to work (the code is plain buggy, clean and simple, and has been
since long before I started making changes).
Or decide that you don't want to upgrade, and don't complain when you
don't get new features.
