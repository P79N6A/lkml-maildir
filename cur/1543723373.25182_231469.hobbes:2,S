Which PG_again check are you talking about?
I think BUG_ON()s in file backed page codes should be kept for now.
For swap pages, one possibility to reserve a special swap entry
constant (SWAP_AGAIN) and check page->private instead of PageAgain
check, but I'm not sure if this is a good idea.
#define	SWAP_AGAIN	~0UL
...
static int do_swap_page(struct mm_struct * mm,
        struct vm_area_struct * vma, unsigned long address,
        pte_t *page_table, pmd_t *pmd, pte_t orig_pte, int write_access)
{
...
again:
        page = lookup_swap_cache(entry);
...
        mark_page_accessed(page);
        lock_page(page);
        if (page->private == SWAP_AGAIN) {
		...
		goto again;
	}
