I also thought about tainting the kernel from a userspace program that
messes with runtime power management - switch off and on various devices
at runtime (which is not recommended by anyone) - and you are clearly in
Unsupportedland.
So yes, this is a good idea (although i just would have written a module
without MODULE_LICENSE that just printk'ed "Tainting kernel, we will use
runtime power management" on load.)
