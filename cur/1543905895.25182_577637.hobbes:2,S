... and so the current behaviour is more or less correct, even if not
optimal.
But this patch in fact adds a bug. We don't even need the "special"
signals like SIGSTOP/SIGCONT or freezer to hit this bug.
Suppose that sys_poll() was interrupted by a "normal" signal which
has a handler. It is quite possible that another thread can steal
this signal before us. Now, ERESTARTNOHAND means we restart sys_poll()
with the same (old) timeout, this means that sys_poll() does _not_
return when timeout expired (if no fds ready), and this is bug.
Also, the false signal_wake_up() is possible, and again, the spurious
-EINTR is better than restart with the same timeout.
What we need is ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK, and restart_block.arg2 should
have the new timeout value, which takes the time we already slept
into account.
Oleg.
