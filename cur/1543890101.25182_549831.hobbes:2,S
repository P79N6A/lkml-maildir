I don't know any, most older kernels did work fine for me, but I never user 
iperf there so I guess if the bug is there also I simply didn't trigger it.
If you think it's usefull I could go back and try different kernels, but that 
would take some time.
Except the iperf bug 2.6.21.1 and 2.6.22-rc3 work fine.
