I know these are specific examples, but:
- profile time is a periodic thingie, so if you have it, forget about
  having a tickless system. Periodic interrupt for this guy, get it 
  out of the equation.
- slice time vs runtime limit. I don't remember what is the granularity of
  the runtime limit, but it could be expressed in slice terms. If not,
  we are talking (along with any other times) of min() operations, which
  are just a few cycles each [granted, they add up].

This is just talking out of my ass, but I guess that for each invocation
they will have more or less the same overhead in execution time, let's
say T. For the periodic tick, the total overhead (in a second) is T*HZ;
with tickless, it'd be T*number_of_context_switches_per_second, right?
Now, the ugly case would be if number_of_context_swiches_per_second > HZ.
In HZ = 100, this could be happening, but in HZ=1000, in a single CPU
...well, that would be TOO weird [of course, a real-time app with a 
1ms period would do that, but it'd require at least an HZ of 10000 to
work more or less ok and we'd be below the watermark].
So in most cases, and given the assumptions, we'd end up winning,
beause number_of_context..., even if variable, is going to be bound
on the upper side by HZ.
Well, you know way more than I do about this, so here is the question:
what is the error in that line of reasoning?
