i'd have no problem with going to atomic_dec_return() on i386 too.  
atomic_dec_call_if_*() is just working around a gcc limitation: there's 
no way to pass a condition from inline assembly into C code, it has to 
go over a register. But the difference is small, just 1 extra 'sete' 
instruction. So x86 would be just fine with atomic_dec_return() too.
anyway, it seems like everyone would like to hack a few instructions 
from the fastpath, so we might as well go with your approach. As long as 
the state is well-defined (and it has to be well-defined because it all 
hits the common slowpath), and the function names are descriptive of 
what happens, it's fine with me.
