Sorry for that. It's not my code (except to the pad resolution scaling). ;)

Well, there is a reason. You usually want to be able to get to the other
edge of the screen with a few moves of the finger. So the preferred
final sensitivity depends on the screen size.
But, since we don't know the screen size, we can't do this properly and
thus it's better not to do it at all.

I agree. We should give it the same perceived resolution as a standard
400 DPI mouse (which is what the firmware does in mouse emulation mode)
regardless of the screen size. That's actually the only way how it can
mix with normal mouse data properly.

It's different hardware. While the ALPS pad delivers X axis in the range
of 0 to 1000, the Synaptics pad will give X axis values from approx 1500
to approx 5500. This is four times the resolution - the size of the pad
is mostly the same.
Synaptics or ALPS don't deliver deltas in native mode. They deliver
absolute coordinates of the finger touching. That's why there is any
math delivered at all.

The policy of input drivers is not to scale or otherwise modify the
data. That's why the input_dev struct contains the ranges of the axes.
Btw, what do you mean by "synaptics mode of alps"?

Neither are broken. But mousedev.c (and similarly the X touchpad driver)
must take the pad resolution into account, otherwise the cursor will
move four times faster with Synaptics than with ALPS.

I added the scaling code, because my ALPS pad was *unbearably* slow.
The original code in mousedev divided by 8 (instead of 2), because it
was tuned for Synaptics.
We need to divide by 2 for ALPS and by 8 for Synaptics, and that's
basically all we need to do. But we must not do that by checking the pad
manufacturer, because when a third pad type comes in (Say Logitech
TouchPad 3), we shouldn't need to modify mousedev.c
