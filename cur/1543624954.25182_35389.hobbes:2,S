Truning bus masters off is easy enough, and could just be done by some
generic PCI reboot code. But for a linux-linux boot I think you also want
to turn off interrupt generation to make sure some device isn't screaming
on some irq, and that definitely requires explicit help by the driver
itself.
One question that hasn't come up: do we actually want to use the "remove"
function for this, or have a separate shutdown function? Are there reasons
to not use "remove" for shutdown?
