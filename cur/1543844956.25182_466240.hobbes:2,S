Ok, I will do the diff against a vanilla kernel, good point.

Ok, good idea.

Ok, now only :
CONFIG_MARKERS
and
CONFIG_MARKERS_FORCE_DIRECT_CALL (only appears is EMBEDDED is enabled)
I have rewritted almost everything else, I will post a patch soon (currently
cleaning up). It now supports inline function, unrolled loops and multiple
definitions of the same marker.
Supporting inline functions has proven more important than I first thought
because of gcc 4.0+ optimisations where it takes a static-only function and
inline it automatically in the body of the caller. It removes the symbols of the
inlined function when it does that.
My new approach is a separate .markers section, everything is there.
