Subject: [RFC][PATCH] UDF filesystem uid fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
I would appreciate if someone with file system knowledge could review
this patch from Phillip Susi.
From: Phillip Susi <psusi@cfl.rr.com>
The UDF filesystem refused to update the file's uid and gid on the
disk if the in memory inode's id matched the values in the uid= and
gid= mount options.  This was causing the owner to change from the
desktop user to root when the volume was ejected and remounted.  I
changed this so that if the inode's id matches the mount option, it
writes a -1 to disk, because when the filesystem reads a -1 from disk,
it uses the mount option for the in memory inode.  This allows you to
use the uid/gid mount options in the way you would expect.
