Why remove a working driver?  Who gets to decide that everyone must go
use this gpio api based system that isn't yet supported by all
platforms?  If someone thinks the old drivers should be replaced by new
ones using the new GPIO API then they should go implement it, and then
when it works they can remove the old one.  You can't just declare that
you think the old one sucks and should be removed and if anyone else
cares they should go make a working driver to replace it.
