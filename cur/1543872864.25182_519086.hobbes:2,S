Hi,
I'm running a slackware 10.2 on a HP/Compaq nx5000.
With kernels <= 2.6.17.3 I didn't have problems.
Starting from 2.6.19 if I close the notebook's video,
or if I press the lid switch,
after a couple of time, or after a few seconds, the o.s. hangs
completely. The only thing to do is a brute power off
by pressing for 5 seconds the power button
(If I press for few it should do a clean shutdown -h).
I've tried 2.6.19, 2.6.19.1, 2.6.19.2, 2.6.20, 2.6.20.1, 2.6.20.2,
and all of them seem to give problems.
I don't have KERNEL_DEBUG set, so I haven't any debug informations,
I will be happy to activate it and provide more info if someone suggests
me which debug parameters I should set.
There's nothing in /var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog,
except for the message "LID switch" added by me
with a logger command in /etc/acpi/acpi_handler.sh.
I've put it after noticing the problem, in order to be sure the event was
detected, and it was.
