Well, why not use them since we have them (C99 standard and over a year 
in the kernel). ;)
What is "preferred" in a group of a few thousands, is hard to say, but I 
believe it is the way to go. The only "resistance" to it I know, is "it 
is not a C idiom". A quite illogical statement, at best. However, the 
0/1 vs false/true is just a preference. (I like false/true, since I also 
say "true AND false = false" for example... (NOT true = false, makes 
sense to me, NOT 1 = 0 seem strange, why can't it be 2, or -1 ;) ))

I believe I have heard they can be a problem in some situations. It also 
have the benefit of uniforming the kernel-code.
