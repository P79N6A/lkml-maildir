That's exactly why you want the bitmap. Fortunately you can add it after 
the array is created. Now the bad news, you should read and understand 
the meaning of the "far" layout. Part of the information is in the mdadm 
man page under -p, some in the md man page. Use of "far" layout will 
effect the performance of the array, the balance of read vs. write 
performance, and (maybe) the reliability.
Two hours is a pretty short time to invest if you find that you have 
your layout wrong and would be better off for the life of the array with 
some other data layout. And the time to do the reading is worth if if 
you wind up convinced that the default settings are fine for you.
