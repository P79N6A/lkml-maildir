It means you have more lockdep classes (lock instantiation sites,
explicit class keys etc..) that we have static storage reserved for.
One way to quickly achieve this is load/unload modules. Zapping the
classes on module unload does not make the space available again.
Sadly most setups these days try to load every module under the sun,
wasting valuable boot time, and causing this head-ache.
Someone reported to me increasing MAX_LOCKDEP_KEYS_BITS to 15 (IIRC)
made his distro build work again. Of course, cycle reloading a module
will eventually run you out of space anyway.

Not sure I fully understand what you mean here, but I've never seen this
result in anything but a warning, the kernel will just continue..
Or are you trying to debug a deadlock and can't because lockdep runs out
of classes before it gets to the offending code?
Something you can do is build a kernel without (or very few modules) - a
good idea anyway as turning off all that unused stuff will significantly
improve build times too :-)
