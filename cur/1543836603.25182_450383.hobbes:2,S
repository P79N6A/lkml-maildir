Because the non-boot CPUs are taken off early, before anything else, and the
system is effectively non-SMP during the entire suspend-resume cycle
(well, almost).  If SMP-related things go wrong during the suspend, CPU
hotplug is the first suspect. ;-)

Yes, it would, but I have a little experience with these things.
Well, looks like on_each_cpu() is run via flush_tlb_all() from
__smp_prepare_cpu() which is called by __cpu_up() and that's used by the CPU
hotplug.  Not that I can tell what goes wrong here, if anything.
