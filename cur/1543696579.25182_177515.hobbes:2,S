Hello,
I have been searching for information on fibre channel HBA support for the
2.6.0 kernel. I was hoping to use the LSIFC919, but my search seems to
indicate this driver is not yet supported in the 2.6.0 kernel.
I did find the HP Fibre Channel HBA is supported. Can anyone please advise
me about any other Fibre Channel HBA support in the 2.6.0 kernel?
Thanks,
