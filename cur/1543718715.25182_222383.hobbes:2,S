No, it doesn't. It tests it, if !present, it goes to do_no_page,
do_file_page or do_swap_page, but the,i if present, it does:
	entry = pte_mkyoung(entry);
	ptep_establish(vma, address, pte, entry);
	update_mmu_cache(vma, address, entry);
	pte_unmap(pte);
	spin_unlock(&mm->page_table_lock);
	return VM_FAULT_MINOR;
Which is, I think, the software PAGE_ACCESSED path used on some archs.
(ptep_establish does set_pte)
