I'm talking about the geometry of the disk.  If the disk has 16 sectors 
and 8 heads, then the maximum value allowed for any valid address is 16 
in the sector field and 7 in the heads field.  This influences the 
translation to/from LBA.  A sector with LBA of 1234 would have a CHS 
address using this geometry of 9/5/3.  If the disk reports a geometry of 
x/8/16 but the bios is using a geometry of x/255/63, then when you pass 
9/5/3 to int 13 it will fetch LBA 144902 which is clearly not going to 
give you what you wanted.
This is why you must use the same geometry that the bios exposes, NOT 
what the disk reports in its inquiry command.  It is quite typical for a 
disk to report that it uses 8 heads and has a number of cylinders that 
is > 1024.  The bios will typically present a view of the disk with 255 
heads ( though it very well may use a smaller value ).  If you generate 
CHS addresses when you write the MBR using 8 heads, they will be wrong 
when you try to pass them to the bios.

Yes, they do require the same geometry, see above.

The bios will not accept values that are larger than it's idea of the 
disk's geometry.  If the bios thinks the disk only has 8 heads, you 
can't ask it to fetch a sector on head 17.

Not sure why you pasted the example bios code, maybe you could explain?
