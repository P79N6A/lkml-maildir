Subject: How to dump stack for kernel threads

In a driver that I am debugging, there is a periodic task that runs every minute. Intermittently, it 
destructively interrupts some other activity in the driver, but I have not been able to find the 
section that is not thread-safe. I have included a dump_stack call at the point where the problem is 
evident, but the current thread is OK. How would I generate a stack dump of the rest of this 
driver's kernel threads? Dumping all kernel threads would also be OK.
Thanks,
Larry
