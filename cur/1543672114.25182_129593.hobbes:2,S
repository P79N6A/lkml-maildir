       -R --random
              When assigning addresses to libraries, start with random
              address within architecture dependant virtual address
              space range.  This can make some buffer overflow attacks
              slightly harder to exploit, because libraries are not
              present on the same addresses accross different
              machines.  Normally, assigning virtual addresses starts
              at the bottom of architecture dependant range.
