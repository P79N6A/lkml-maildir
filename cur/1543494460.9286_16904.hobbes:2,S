  Hello.
  So because it seems my patches fixed the problems of some people with quotas
and testers didn't noticed any other problems I'm submitting the patches. The diff
is against 2.2.6.
							Bye Honza.
PS: The world doesn't like this mail ;-) First time typo in address second time
not enough memory on vger. I wonder what will be next :-).
