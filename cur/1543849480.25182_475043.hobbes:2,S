Sorry but it did not help. Both errors (pcmcia ioctl and drm) are still there. 
It is hard to trigger these errors when debugging is enabled. I did something 
like 10 or more reboots with no error seen. When I recompiled the kernel 
without debugging support almost every reboot triggers error. The good thing 
is that beside these errors system is usable and wifi works just fine.
