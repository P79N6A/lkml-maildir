Yes, I was under the impression that the external initramfs was the 
'special case' and I seem to forget about it, I guess that's what most  
kernel distribution still do (I haven't been using a distribution-supplied 
kernel for quite a while...).
Anyway, the patches I contributed in one the previous mail (didn't reach 
the kexec list due to moderation but available on LKML) can help with 
what Bernhard is aiming for. I took quite a dive into makedumpfile's code 
to figure out what's the best way to integrate it. What I was thinking 
was something in the lines of:
 * early on, detect if /proc/vmcore has a LINUX elf note 
   * if it has, then don't require '-x' or '-i' on the command line,
     extract it to a temporary file and treat it as a CONFIGFILE for 
     the rest of the code flow.
   * otherwise, continue with the regular flow.
For just extracting OSRELEASE, it is possible to write a simple program or 
script that searches for it at the first few kilobytes of the file.
