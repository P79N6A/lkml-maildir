You're doing very well. The parent of the process may have disappeared
so you won't be able to trace it back in the way you suggest.
It might actually be possible nowadays to provide backing space on disk for the
stacks of live processes. Nearly everyone will have 2GB spare for 256*8MB
of emergency stack space. That about takes care of everyones problems,
since not walking malloced memory when you get it to make sure its
there is the programmers decision.
