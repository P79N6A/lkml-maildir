I still object to #2.  We should have the flexibility to have 'struct
resource's that are not in this array in the pci_dev.  I would like to
see the SR-IOV resources _not_ in this array (and indeed, I'd like to
see PCI bridges keep their producer resources somewhere other than in
this array).  I accept that there are still some problems with this, but
patch #2 moves us further from being able to achieve this goal, not
closer.
