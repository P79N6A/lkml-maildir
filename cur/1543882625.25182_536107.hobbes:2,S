From a quick grep, DEBUG_KERNEL will only increase the kernel size on PARISC 
(arch/parisc/mm/init.c), so setting it won't have any adverse affect on your 
kernel size (if you disable all the options under it).

I agree with this. It's also quite interesting to see that one can enable 
DEBUG_KERNEL, increase CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT, and then disable DEBUG_KERNEL, 
and the changed value is still used.
I think it should be easier to change this value, as anybody with it set too 
low has a useless kernel log buffer and it can make reporting more difficult.
