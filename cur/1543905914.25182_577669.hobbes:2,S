Hi all,
eventhough people often write only when they have something to complain
about, I for once would like to congratulate Matti and David, our mail
admins, for the wonderful job they've done with the spams lately. This
month, I might have seen maybe one or two instead of perhaps 30 per day
earlier. While it did not bother me that much earlier, I can say that
the list is more pleasant to read every day, and I think that's great.
Kudos guys !
Willy
