Note that BUG() can be a no-op so dumping something on disk might not make 
sense there. This seems useful, but you probably need to make this bit 
more generic so that using BUG() proper in your filesystem code does the 
right thing. Inventing your own wrapper should be avoided.

No need for upper case in function names.

Please drop this wrapper function. It's better to open-code the error
handling in the callers (there are total of three of them).

This looks fishy. All reads and writes are serialized by compr_mutex 
because they share a scratch buffer for compression and uncompression?

Indeed. And I think you're getting some more trouble because of this...

Seems wasteful to first read the data in a scratch buffer and then 
memcpy() it immediately for the COMPR_NONE case. Any reason why we can't 
read a full struct page, for example, and simply use that if we don't need 
to uncompress anything?

Not claiming to undestand your on-disk format, but wouldn't it make more 
sense if we knew whether a given segment is compressed or not _before_ we 
actually read it?
