The new interface that supercedes these is ->get_sset_count(), which was 
added to provide additional functionality without having to add a new 
hook each time we want to return a new integer value.  This new 
interface also (intentionally) aligns with the existing ->get_strings() 
interface.  ("sset" in get_sset_count stands for "string set")
