Cirtainly I can see why we want this
warning out there and very much in the submitters face, it just feels a
little heavy handed to make them change option to get the result.
Would not just always appending this message in --file mode always be
just as effective?  Perhaps suppressing it with -q, or with some new "i
know what I am doing" option?
