This is very brutal way of doing things, that somebody forced to do
against unwilling e-mails. I have it enabled in exim also as an
experiment (thus, see reply-to/mail-follow-up). It doesn't stop, but
reduces spam.
Especially this is wrong WRT mailing list. That's why i've proposed
* trivial checking for `in-reply-to/references' (SHOULD in rfc2822)
  (see, wizard -- no hands!)
* starting new threads will require valid ticket-requesting message
  first (as part of patch bomb of something like that, for instance).
My experiments show, that spam doesn't have any hint of mail header
magic, only stupid ms outlook stuff. Thus i don't think that idea is
very insecure and all that kind of things. Conversely developers like
Alan will not spend time and energy arguing about `modern ways of
dealing with reality' :)
