Sorry, but I think I was educated yesterday that ->fault() (only in 
-mm) is where we'd be heading. Nopfn is deprecated. But conceptually, 
this does'nt change things.

The new path via fault works in both cases with and without struct 
page behind. No need to keep the old one as far as I see.

Good. Let me see if I can come up with a patch on this.

I fear I am not the right person to answer that question. In the good 
old days before discontigmem/sparse mem/vmem map where invented we 
used to have a hack for that in arch/. Heiko then decided my hack is a 
mess and came up with a good solution to the problem.
so long,
