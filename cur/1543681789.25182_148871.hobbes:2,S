The default kernel can spend very large amounts of time in IDE code.
With DMA it can be seconds.
With PIO it can be minutes.
This means that with PIO one may think that the system crashed, and see
(under X) keyboard or mouse actions only after for example two minutes.
With DMA things are much better, but still a delay of seconds
is very noticeable.
The input code used to have
        if (psmouse->pktcnt && time_after(jiffies, psmouse->last + HZ/20)) {
                printk(KERN_WARNING "psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing \
%d bytes away.\n", psmouse->pktcnt);
                psmouse->pktcnt = 0;
        }
and I patched it to HZ/2, that helps, but is still not good enough.
