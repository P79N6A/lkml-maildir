Hi,
I posted these numbers since they help show that Davide's scheduler, on my
rather extreme, data point helps.  The goal of the program use is NOT to be
the fastest and most efficient.  Rather its to port a very usefull tool to
a very portable solution.  This puts stress on the context switching code 
in the various OSes (BTW NT is the fastest at this so far).
Instead of questioning the code I strongly suggest that more numbers are
gathered.  If this scheduler is faster in the common case, and will scale
better on loaded systems, then its a win. 
Lets get some numbers and see.
