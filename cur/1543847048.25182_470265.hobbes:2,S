Does this mean, you cannot find the config because /proc/config.gz
doesn't exist?  Then try /boot/config-2.6.8.  Maybe I misunderstood you?

I think offically the initcalls are in no particular order, but in
practice in depends on the linking order.  For my kernel the next line
is
	IP route cache hash table entries: 32768 (order: 5, 131072 bytes)

You can try the "initcall_debug" kernel parameter to see which init
functions are called.
