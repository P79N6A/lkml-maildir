No, that's a bug.
You have to realize that there are architectures that need special
initialization and page allocation for semaphores: they need special flags
in the TLB for "careful access", for example (sometimes the careful access
ends up being non-cached).
You can't just put semaphores anywhere and tell the kernel to try to fix
up whatever happened.
