A proper assert does not return a value, by definition.  It relies purely
on side effects, that is, it causes a screeching halt if the logical
expression was false.  It's always wrong to use an asssert in an expression,
and since BUG_ON is just assert(!expression) this applies to BUG_ON as
well.  The compiler should prevent you from making this mistake.
What I *thought* you meant was: "if the next fool that comes along is
exactly the same as the last fool, run away screaming".  There's some wisdom
in that.
