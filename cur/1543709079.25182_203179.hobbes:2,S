correct, on those machines the IDE bus is wired "reversed" and we take
the data without any correction, except for IDENTIFY and atapi requests.
That means that quite a few ioctls (SMART etc) are most likely broken
right now.

that would be the perfect solution. Note that atapi transfers are
already correct the way they are - nothing to fix here.
