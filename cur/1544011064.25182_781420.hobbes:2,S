Quite similar, yes :)
Looking at tracing_mark_write(), I am wondering if the fact that it
returns a count including the added \n is an expected side effect ? A
write() returning a count larger than the number of bytes written seems
to be a bit unexpected... But if we remove the \n from the count, then
the case where one write \0 into the event content would end up doing an
endless loop.
