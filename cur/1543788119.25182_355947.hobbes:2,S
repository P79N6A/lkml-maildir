If you lend someone linux, you're _distributing_ linux. The
GPL is about _distribution_ I believe, it doesn't have to be a _sale_.
You can't _lend_ someone windows (as a way of doing business) without
satisfying ms licencing terms either.

Well, the wifi driver may or may not be under the GPL licence.
Check that first.  The linux kernel itself is GPL of course.

Check where it is downloaded from, that is where linux
is being distributed from. Likely the same company though.

They don't need to keep the kernel secret for security.  Of course they 
can still
keep their scripts secret, their (non-GPL) userland utilities secret, their
proprietary drivers secret and the hw specs secret. Good or bad, it is
up to them.  But it seems to me they have to offer the kernel source,
at least.
