If it's really important to not have patches depend on eachother until
we get to the non-lite core, i386 (and soon ppc, x86_64) patches, then
we should put all of the Kconfig bits in the main patch, so long as we
think all of the related drivers will be able to make it in as well (or
will move those bits out again when it's time).  Or we could just
document dependancies and move on.
