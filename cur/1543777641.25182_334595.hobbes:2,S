Hi , i have kernel 2.4.29 at slack 10.1 and when I upgrade my kernel to
2.6.11 I get these erros on booting
VFS: Cannot open a root device "301" or unknow block
please append a correct "root" boot option
KERNEL PANIC :  not syncing; VFS; Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block
(3,1)
I have compiled my kernel with my IDE support and also with my file system
support with built-in option.
My LILO.CONF
image = /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.11
root = /dev/hda1
label = 2.6.11
initrd = /boot/initrd.gz
read-only
I googled this problem, and I think is a kind of bug, and i tryed to patch
the kernel with Alan Cox patch 2.6.11-ac7.bzip  and I get these ::
bzip2 -dc /usr/src/patch-2.6.11.ac7.bzip | patch -p1 -s
1 out of hunk FAILED --saving rejects to file Makefike.rej
and I cat the file Makefile.rej

this problem ...
