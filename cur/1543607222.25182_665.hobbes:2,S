The latest 3dmd from the 3ware site doesn't seem to work on recent
kernels, at least on 2.4.12-ac{2,6}.  The driver/array work fine.
3dmd starts up, but bringing up the page gives:
  Error: No Controllers Found
I get the following in syslog:
  Oct 23 09:28:35 nova 3dmd: ioctl(4) failed: No such file or directory
  Oct 23 09:28:35 nova 3dm: 3dmd startup succeeded
Doing an strace on 3dmd (which succeeds only partly, due to threads?)
yields the following, which may be related:
  1649  open("/dev/sda", O_RDWR)          = 4
  1649  ioctl(4, FIBMAP, 0xbffff2a0)      = 327680
  1649  fstat64(1, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(136, 2), ...}) = 0
  1649  old_mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, 
-1,
        0) = 0x40000000
  1649  ioctl(1, TCGETS, {B38400 opost isig icanon echo ...}) = 0
  1649  write(1, "ioctl(4) failed: No such file or"..., 43) = 43
  1649  close(4)                          = 0
Anyone else run into this?  Any ideas on how to fix?
