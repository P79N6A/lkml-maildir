I was talking about a different scenario:
        add_wait_queue_exclusive(&q->wait_for_request, &wait);
        for (;;) {
                __set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
	/* WINDOW */
                spin_lock_irq(&io_request_lock);
                rq = get_request(q, rw);
                spin_unlock_irq(&io_request_lock);
                if (rq)
                        break;
                generic_unplug_device(q);
                schedule();
        }
        remove_wait_queue(&q->wait_for_request, &wait);
Suppose there are two tasks sleeping in the schedule().
A wakeup comes.  One task wakes.  It loops aound and reaches
the window.  At this point in time, another wakeup gets sent
to the waitqueue. It gets directed to the task which just
woke up!  It should have been directed to a sleeping task,
not the current one which just *looks* like it's sleeping,
because it's in state TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE.
This can happen in test4.

No, I think it's the same in test4 and test1X.  In current kernels
it's still the case that the woken task gets atomically switched into
state TASK_RUNNING, and then becomes "hidden" from the wakeup code.
The problem is, the task bogusly sets itself back into
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE for a very short period and becomes
eligible for another wakeup.
There's not much which ll_rw_blk.c can do about this.

The above scenario can happen in all kernels.

Yes, but I haven't seen a "stuck in D state" report for a while.
I assume this is because this waitqueue gets lots of wakeups sent to it.
The ones in networking I expect are protected by other locking
which serialises the wakeups.
The one in the x86 semaphores avoids it by sending an extra wakeup
to the waitqueue on the way out.

Linus suggested at one point that we clear the waitqueue's
WQ_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE bit when we wake it up, so it falls back
to non-exclusive mode.  This was to address one of the
task-on-two-waitqueues problems...
