Hm, very strange. I don't have an SMP machine here, but I must admit
that Trond's patch (in it's v0.9 incarnation) runs rock solid here.
Also, I have a feeling that Trond's code is the best thing that
happened to Linux NFS, ever!
In 2.0 era, I was writing at 20-50KB/sec (sic!). When knfs got
introduced in 2.1, performance slightly raised but never above
~300KB/sec. And that data comes from 100MBps fdx connection!, between
fast machines, unloaded network.
Now, I'm spending last few days constantly writing and writing at
~1MB/sec. Unbelievable. It's becoming addictive. :) If only I could
utilize wsize of 32768, I bet it would be even faster (currently, code
allows me to raise wsize up to 16384, and I can't find where the limit
is).
Whatever tests I ran, kernel didn't even hickup, and I never saw such
good and stable NFS code in 2.1/2.2 kernels. As always, YMMV.
OK, that's it. Probably code should be double checked wrt SMP issues,
but I'm very glad Alan put it in his -ac patches, so it gets more
thoroughly tested, on various setups.
