There are permanent and transient errors.
Removing a device is ENODEV and I think this is not closely related to any 
filesystem. Only Windows seems to detect this properly (the error messages 
are perhaps mistranslated by cygwin?)
If the device hits bad sectors then NTFS adds them to the $BadClust list 
on-the-fly and won't try to use them anymore, users don't notice anything 
unless asked. _Some_ bad sectors don't mean the disk is dying: not all 
disks have reserved zone, remapping or it's too small, etc. Many people
use NTFS having defected sectors without issues and no new ones develop
in time.
Thanks for your work. I think it's is important.
Cheers,
