Ok, __block_fsync is much better than just fsync_dev.
Are there other parts of blkdev_close you want merged into 
blkdev_put? Without changing the reread blocks on last close 
semantics, I think this is all we can do.
As far as I can tell, bdev->bd_inode is valid to send 
to __block_fsync, am I missing something?
