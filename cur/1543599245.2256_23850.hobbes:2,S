Your point being? This is power yeah. However I can get 50W with 1V@50A
and with 50V@1A ... tell me which will be easier for a regulator when
going from 10 to 50W while trying to keep the voltage steady.
So to rephrase myself the condition of less power dissipation (and that is
thermal output, not power consumption which isvoltage times current... )
is the result of less current draw of ~30A. This is a huge difference. And
this is the problem. There are regulators on certain motherboards which
can't cope with this. And they increase (not that bad unless you fry a 
chip) when current drops, or decrease voltage when there is current need
(crash) of the tolerance limmits.
Sorry for the OT.
