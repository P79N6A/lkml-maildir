With kernel.org 2.6.15.7 (uni-processor) I've not seen NBD hang in the
kernel like I am with RHEL5 and SLES10.  This hang (tcp timeout) is
indefinite oh RHEL5 and ~5min on SLES10.
Should/can I be playing with TCP timeout values?  Why was this not a
concern with kernel.org 2.6.15.7; I was able to "feel" the nbd
connection break immediately; no MD superblock update hangs, no
longwinded (or indefinite) TCP timeout.
regards,
Mike
