Sorry to bring up a topic that should have been settled a long time ago.
I found that the interface consisting of
 - open a handle
 - add a file descriptor with an event mask to handle
 - remove a file/watch descriptor from handle
 - wait on handle, get events
 - close handle
in inotify is _very_ similar to how epoll is represented to user
space. Is there a good reason that epoll is a set of syscalls while
inotify is a character device, or is one of them simply wrong?
