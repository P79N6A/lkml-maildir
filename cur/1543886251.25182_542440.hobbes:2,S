The bug was reported by Florin Iucha (on lkml!) on Saturday. It has only
just been debugged, and I was in fact in the middle of marshalling the
fixes.

Probably my fault. I've had a couple of weeks of heavy travel due to
various circumstances that were beyond my control, and so I had little
time in which to test the stuff and push it out.
Another factor that is affecting us is the slow but gradual collapse of
the OSDL NFSv4 regression testing effort.
