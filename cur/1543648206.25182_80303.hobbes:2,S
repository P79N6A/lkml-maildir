That's exactly the reason why you don't want to use many threads. Typical
applications that uses multiplex interfaces uses only one task (
eventually for each CPU ) that handles many connections. And again, you
can also use threads, if you design your application correctly. It is not
that expensive having service threads popping from an array. Yes, you have
a lock to be acquired but this is a price you have to pay as soon as you
choose threads.
