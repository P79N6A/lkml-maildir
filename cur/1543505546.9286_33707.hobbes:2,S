Subject: Memory leak/OOM in 2.2.11

Note: Sorry if this is already known problem. I am not on the linux-kernel
mailing list, please Cc replies directly to me.
2.2.11 seems to be leaking memory somewhere (probably in the networking code)
for me. Seems to be 100% reproducible.
Running my server program (described later) on my dual P3 running 2.2.11
and bombing it with requests from 2 Sparcstations running Solaris 2.7
(each running 30 clients in parallel) for a while my machine seems to run
out of memory in kernel-space and OOM-kills every process which tries to
run. Situation doesn't get any better even when I kill the clients on the
Suns, only thing I can do is cold-reboot the machine. Kernel doesn't lock
up nor panic nor give any error messages.
Shift-scroll lock output from one of the "crashes":

(This was typed in from a videocam-snapshot of the screen, right edge cut
some numbers in the middle.)
On the last try I was running "free" on 1sec intervals, the last output
before it got OOM-killed was this:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        257688     255052       2636       1612       2188       4652

Swap:       259232       3276     255956
I couldn't get the full meminfo output from this run but got one line which
seemed quite interesting:
Networking buffers in use          : 774499
Tested 2.2.10-ac12 on the same machine, worked fine. 2.2.10 on a single
processor P2, worked ok.
Description of the server program:
Mainloop listens on an UDP socket for requests and forks off children to
serve them.
Child processes work like this:
s = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,IPPROTO_TCP);
connect(s,remote_host_address);
f = open(file_path,O_RDONLY);
while (!eof(f))
{
  read(f,data);
  write(s,data);
}
close(s);
close(f);
All machines are connected to a relatively lightly loaded 100Mbit segment,
both Linux machines that I've tested this on have a 3Com 905B network adapter.
Kernel .config for the kernel that has trouble attached.
I can provide more information if necessary and run tests with different
kernels too.
