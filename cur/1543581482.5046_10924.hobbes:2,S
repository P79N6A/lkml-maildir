Hello all, forgive me if this has already been discovered...
I think I have found a bug in the AMI Megatrends RAID controller driver,
scsi/megaraid.c.
If I look in the old, 2.2.x code, in the routine mega_findCard, I find:
    if (flag != BOARD_QUARTZ) {
      /* Request our IO Range */
      if (check_region (megaBase, 16)) {
        printk (KERN_WARNING "megaraid: Couldn't register I/O range!" ...
        scsi_unregister (host);
        continue;
      }
     request_region (megaBase, 16, "megaraid");
And in the 2.4.1 code, same routine, I find:
         if (flag != BOARD_QUARTZ) {
      /* Request our IO Range */
      if (request_region (megaBase, 16, "megaraid")) {
        printk (KERN_WARNING "megaraid: Couldn't register I/O range!" ...
        scsi_unregister (host);
        continue;
      }
    }
I think the code is missing a "!" in front of request_region(). It seems
that the 2.4.1 kernel does not recognize my RAID controller where as
2.2.x does. 
L8r,
Mark G.
