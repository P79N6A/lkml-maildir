It doesn't. I'm currently working on board support for the Toradex Colibri
module, plus one board that uses that module. It works for me now, but 
still needs some testing and cleanup. I'll probably post my patch to the
linux-arm-kernel list next week and try to get it into mainline.

Yes - please _don't_ use the 2.6.12-something stuff available somewhere
for the Colibri. It contains a serious bug that cost me days to find,
and it's hopelessly out of date.
Step 1.1: Apply my board support patch. Either wait until I post it to
the list or contact me by private mail.
Step 1.2: If your board has an LCD or other extra hardware, add support 
for it in colibri.c.

Depending on your bootloader, you might need to perform extra 
steps, e.g. for U-Boot you need to convert zImage to uImage.

I'd recommend to ask this question again on the linux-arm-kernel
list. We shouldn't flood linux-kernel list with arch specific stuff.
It would also be interesting to know which toolchain and/or
distribution you intend to use. Note that you do not only need
a kernel, but also a root file system. The colibri module has only
32MB flash, which means you have to handcraft a small rfs. If you
don't have any plans yet, have a look at www.busybox.net, and
www.scratchbox.org. I used scratchbox to cross compile my kernel
and the packages for my root file system.

True. See you there,
