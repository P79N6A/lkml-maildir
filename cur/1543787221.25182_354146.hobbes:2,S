Another data point:
I'm unable to reproduce on a PATA install.  Specifically, booting on a
PATA HD with sata_nv as a module.  When booting on a SATA HD with
sata_nv compiled in, I get the race.  Setting irq 1,5 (keyboard and
libata) handlers to cpu0 affinity and X affinity to cpu0 solves the
problem.
I haven't had time to try booting SATA with sata_nv as a module in initrd.
