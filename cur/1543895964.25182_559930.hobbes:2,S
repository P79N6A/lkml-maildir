This logic has been proven already. Apple used KHTML and KJS as the backend 
systems for Safari. While Safari was in development they held onto all their 
changes and modifications. When they released Safari, they contributed it all 
back, making both things better. Fact: KHTML and KJS are also the core of 
Apples "WebKit" and "WebCore" technologies - both KHTML and KJS are Open 
Source projects, making up a part of KDE.
