ouch. So you want/need to wait for a specific type of interrupt, in a 
section of code that has all interrupts disabled? Is this the only form 
of communication to the hypervisor, for this particular purpose? It 
seems to me that polling a bit in a buffer shared between the hypervisor 
and the guest OS [combined with cpu_relax()] would fit this scenario 
alot better (and wouldnt cause any such gymnastics to avoid regular 
Linux irq processing) than waiting for an interrupt to be injected by 
the hypervisor. Or is this interrupt-based interface an ABI property and 
the only way to do it?
