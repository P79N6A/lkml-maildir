Well, the scsi-dledford-2.4 tree is intended to be someplace I can put
all the stuff I'm having to carry forward in our kernels, so that's
distinctly different than a driver update only tree.  I could do that
separately and I have no problem doing that.  As for the other stuff,
I'm not pushing to necessarily get any of my changes into mainline.  I
would be happy if they make it there sometime as that would relieve load
off of me, but at the same time I *am* making some changes to the core
code (sorry Jens, but there are some ways in which the 2.4 core scsi
code is just too broken to believe and leaving it broken just means
dealing with everyone that points it out in bugzilla entries) and I know
people are loath to change core code in mainline, so I kinda figured a
lot of that stuff would either A) stay separate or B) only after myself
and other interested parties agree on a patch and that patch is widely
tested and known good then maybe it might get moved over, up to Marcelo.
