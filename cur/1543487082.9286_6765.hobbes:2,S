	Suppose that the absence of a generation number (or timestamp)
(internally represented as, say, the value 0) acted as a wildcard?
Couldn't you then upgrade the server without disrupting service on the
clients?
	You'd want the wildcard feature to be configurable, of course,
so you could turn it off when all the clients have been upgraded.
	Straightening out kernel NFS sounds like an important service
improvement... perhaps later in 2.2.x?
