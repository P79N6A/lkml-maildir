Could you please explain? I see no socket in state listening in the code
I wrote from the inspiration given by Roderich. For me it just looks
like a simultanous open. IMO it's not a good idea to get a socket
connected to itself. Atleast it does not crash the system as it did in
MS Windows.
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int sk;
struct sockaddr_in sin;
int r;
int main(void)
{
    sk = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if ( sk < 0 ) {
        perror("socket");
        return 1;
    }
    memset(&sin, 0, sizeof sin);
    sin.sin_family = AF_INET;
    sin.sin_port = htons(4444);
    sin.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("0.0.0.0");
    r = bind(sk, (struct sockaddr *)&sin, sizeof sin);
    if ( r < 0 ) {
        perror("bind");
        return 2;
    }
    system("/bin/bash -c \"netstat -ntua\"");
    memset(&sin, 0, sizeof sin);
    sin.sin_family = AF_INET;
    sin.sin_port = htons(4444);
    sin.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");
    r = connect(sk, (struct sockaddr *)&sin, sizeof sin);
    if ( r < 0 ) {
        perror("connect");
        return 3;
    }
    system("/bin/bash -c \"netstat -ntua\"");
    return 0;
}
The kernel(*) source does state in tcp_input.c:tcp_rcv_state_process:
        if(th->ack) {
...
        } else {
            if(th->syn && !th->rst) {
                /* The previous version of the code
                 * checked for "connecting to self"
                 * here. that check is done now in
                 * tcp_connect.
                 */
Seems the connect to itself is not what we want but the check fails. I
can not even find the check in tcp_connect. As I far as I understand the
usage of this function it even would not block connects with source
address fake to equal destination.
