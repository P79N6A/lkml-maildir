There is at least one architecture supported by 2.6.9 that has no alignment
restrictions what so ever and no struct padding added by the compiler. 
The patch named "rmaplock: PageAnon in mapping" in 2.6.9 doesn't work for
this architecture because it assumes that the address of a member in a
struct can't be odd. 
One possible but ugly patch below. Another possible patch would be to move
i_data above i_bytes and i_sock. I would really like a cleaner patch but I
guess its a bad idea to add a new field to struct page?

Anyone who knows about similar usage of bit 0 and/or 1 in pointers
anywhere?

PS. The architecture I'm referring to is CRIS but there may be more with the
same sloppyness regarding alignment. DS
