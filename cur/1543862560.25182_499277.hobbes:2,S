Ok, 7 seconds for FLUSH_CACHE would have been nice for us too though, as
it would pretty much guarentee lower latencies for random writes and
write back caching. The concern is the barrier code, of course. I guess
I should do some timings on potential worst case patterns some day. Alan
may have done that sometime in the past, iirc.
