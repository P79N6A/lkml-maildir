Still you want to group them as much as possible - each time you lock
a futex you are pinning the containing page into physical memory, that
would cause that if you have, for example, 4000 futexes locked in 4000 
different pages, there is going to be 4 MB of memory locked in ... it
helps to have an allocator that ties them together.
