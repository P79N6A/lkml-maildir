It fixes a bug exposed by a -mm only patch, not by the net tree
(and 2.6.23-rc3-mm1 doesn't contain the net tree at all).

It's about parsers like the Sun C compiler and the C parser shipped 
with genksyms.
We can fix the C parser shipped with genksyms, but we have nearly the 
same problem with userspace C parsers:
These are userspace headers, and we had a bug report that the Sun C 
compiler was not able to compile some userspace code.
