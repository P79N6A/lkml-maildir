I don't understand what you mean by this.
Do you mean that the writes are forced to appear on a different CPU in
the same order that they were written?  That isn't true on x86, for
two reasons: 1. writes aren't always in processor order (see
CONFIG_X86_OOSTORE and CONFIG_X86_PPRO_FENCE); 2. reads on the other
processor are out of order anyway.

Not true.  Take a look at __copy_user() in arch/i386/lib/usercopy.c.
The first few bytes are copied using "rep;movsb", which is not
guaranteed to use a word write for the aligned pair, nor is it
guaranteed a particular timing (there could be an interrupt between
each byte).
Other architectures are similar.
