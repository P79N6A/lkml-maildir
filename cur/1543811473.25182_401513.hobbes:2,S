I haven't yet seen any RCU-based code that does this. Can you point out
what patches you are talking about ? As of 2.6.16-rc4 and -rt15,
AFAICS, you can count tasks by holding the read side of tasklist_lock.
Granted it is a bit ugly to repeat this in order to overcome
the race on dropping tasklist_lock for allocation.

This could be a problem for contexts where sleeping cannot be permitted,
not to mention fast paths where blocking may introduce a skew. It seems
simpler to just let this happen during sysctl time.
