Seeing the same thing here on a Dell Latitude C840.
.  -test4-mm6 was OK, -test5-mm1 was NOT
The card in question is a Xircom 10/100Ethernet/56K modem card.
Under -test4-mm6, it does:

Under -test5-mm1 it says "Socket status: 30000020" after the *first* one (02:01.0)
and locks up hard, not even a SysRq.  Is it perhaps upset about the fact it's
a multifunction card?
