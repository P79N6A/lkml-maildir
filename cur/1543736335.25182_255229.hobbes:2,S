The "old pagefault requirement": the code in there used to perform
readaround at pagefault time as well as readahead at read() time.  Hence it
had to work well for single-page requests.  That requirement isn't there
any more but some of the code to support it is still there, perhaps.

SDET would be interesting, as well as explicit testing of lots of processes
reading the same fully-cached file.

As long as readahead gets fully disabled at some stage, we should be OK.
We should probably compare i_size with mapping->nrpages at open() time,
too.  No point in enabling readahead if it's all cached.  But doing that
would make performance testing harder, so do it later.

It's an application-specified readahead hint.  It should ideally be
asynchronous so the application can get some I/O underway while it's
crunching on something else.  If the queue is contested then the
application will accidentally block when launching the readahead, which
kinda defeats the purpose.
Yes, the application will block when it does the subsequent read() anyway,
but applications expect to block in read().  Seems saner this way.
