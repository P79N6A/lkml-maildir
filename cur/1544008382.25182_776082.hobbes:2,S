No. Linux can swap out COW shared memory too. see swap cache related code.
Also, Linux can discard non-dirty and file mapped shared page.
but, yes.
Linux can't discart dirty or anonymous mapped page.

No.
Linux manage page reference count.
forrk increment it. exit decrement it.
So, when process exiting, Linux can discard non used page immediately.
IOW, reclaim provide "page discard/swap although page is still used" mechanism.
