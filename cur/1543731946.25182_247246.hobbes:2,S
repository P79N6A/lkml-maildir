Actually, I don't think it was broken at all.  It has an old kludge to
avoid considering trace-stopped threads as stopped for purposes of deciding
to generate signals for an orphaned process group.  I think that the useful
thing is for it not to consider any TASK_TRACED thread as stopped here either.
That's what it will already do, and the old kludge can go now:
--- linux-2.6-ptracefix/kernel/exit.c.~1~
