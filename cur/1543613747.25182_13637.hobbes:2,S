Hmm, I _do_ notice a pop when the sound hardware is first initialized at
boot time, but not when mpg123 starts/stops (without esd running) so I
personally don't get any benefit from "the sound of silence".  That said,
asside from the 190 interrupts/sec from esd, it doesn't appear to use any
measurable CPU time by itself.

Hmm, something seems very strange there.  On an idle system, I get about
100 context switches/sec, and about 150/sec when playing sound (up to 400/sec
when moving the mouse between windows).  9000 cswitches/sec is _very_ high.
This is with a text-only player which has screen output (other than the
ID3 info from the currently played song).
Cheers, Andreas
