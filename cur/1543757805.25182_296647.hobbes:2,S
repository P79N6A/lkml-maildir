Hugh: I'll have more of a look through your patch when I get
some time... to be honest I'm not too worried either way, so
long as one or the other gets in.
Very trivial point, but I'm not sure that I like the name
p?d_limit... maybe p?d_span or _span_end... hmm, they're not
really pleasing either.
You _are_ repeating a bit of mindless loop accounting in every
page table walk, and it isn't completely clear to me that it is
giving you much more flexibility (than for_each_*). But my loops
_are_ a bit contorted.

David: just an implementation detail that I had meant to bring
up earlier - would it feel like less of a hack to put these in
pmd_populate and pgd_populate?
