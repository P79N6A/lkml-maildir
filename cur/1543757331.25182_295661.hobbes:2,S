Yes, and there _is_ no ARM equivalent.  Modern CPUs generaly won't
bother with a separate physical I/O space, and special instructions
to access it.  So Linux drivers use macros that always boil down to
normal memory-mapped I/O accessors ... that's what ARM does, and
oddly enough all current users of this driver are on PXA hardware.
I'm not sure what the CFU1U(*) CF/PCMCIA support will need; if that
card maps those registers to I/O space, this driver will need some
minor tweaks (in addition to the PCMCIA framework glue that registers
a new platform_device).  That is, the registers would normally be
memory-mapped, but on some boards they might need to be in I/O space.
All your platform should need to do is initialize a platform_device
with the three resources (two memory, one IRQ), and platform_data
initialized to match the structure defined for that purpose.

If your board is wired to support a separate chip reset (maybe
through a GPIO or something), yes; otherwise, I suppose in this
case I meant the port_power() routine should be handling that.
This driver doesn't have a separate hc_driver.reset() entry, it
does the analagous stuff as part of powering up the chip ... but
as you've noted, that approach is a bit troublesome on boards
that don't have that level of control over the hardware.
It's best to ask questions about USB drivers on linux-usb-devel,
not all USB developers make time to swim through LKML.
