No.
At the moment, I have an option that modifies the codepath so that prior
to saving the LRU, I calculate MD5 checksums for the LRU pages, then
prior to do the atomic copy (ie after saving them), calculate the
checksums again and compare. If the checksum varies, the relevant pages
are also resaved in the atomic copy and not restored from the LRU copy
when we reload the LRU pages at resume time. 
I want to put time into finding what changes the pages. I assume it's
filesystem or raid related because raid users also occasionally report
that raid code is submitting I/O after we've started saving LRU pages
(haven't had such reports from non-raid users).

Nigel
