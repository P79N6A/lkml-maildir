No, that's much clearer.  It's a pity that the anonymous struct/union
syntax isn't general enough to allow:
struct desc_packed {
               u16 limit0;
               u16 base0;
               unsigned base1 : 8, type : 4, s : 1, dpl : 2, p : 1;
               unsigned limit : 4, avl : 1, l : 1, d : 1, g : 1, base2 :8;
};
struct desc {
	struct desc_packed;
};
