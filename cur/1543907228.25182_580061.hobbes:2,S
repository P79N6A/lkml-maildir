That's not quite right.  OHCI-1394 implementations can go beyond 4GB bus
address space.  (Although I don't know if there are such implementations
available.  At least there are two implementations which can set the
so-called Physical Range bigger than 4GB.)
Sbp2 however requires that everything which it DMA-maps resides in the
Physical Range of the controller.  This way the CPU is not involved in
most of the data transfers.  The OHCI-1394 controller acts as bus bridge
between IEEE 1394 bus and local bus, with a 1:1 mapping of IEEE 1394 bus
addresses to and from local bus addresses --- but not in the whole 48
bits white IEEE 1394 bus address range, only in the
implementation-dependent Physical Range.  The minimum Physical Range
that all OHCI-1394 implementations guarantee is 4GB.  I could actually
have set a bigger mask in sbp2 when the controller supports a
programmable bigger range.
So that's the story why that dma_set_mask went into sbp2:  Sbp2 wants
mappings in a _subset_ of the OHCI-1394 controllers DMA range.
Anyway.  For now I will simply go with what 2.6.23-rc has and what
2.6.21 had:  No dma_set_mask anywhere in the 1394 subsystem.  We can
revisit this whenever an actual need arises.
