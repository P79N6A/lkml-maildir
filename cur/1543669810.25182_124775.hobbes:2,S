Too bad for me, I was hoping to use that data structure as a complete list
of email -> name translations for changelog entries. Maybe you could
include them anyway as commented out entries in the data structure? That
would give your script the added benefit of being harvestable for other
purposes, but wouldn't sacrifice the regex speed enhancements.
Not that it's not harvestable now, but folks wouldn't have to maintain
their own addenda.
Be well,
