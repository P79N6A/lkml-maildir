There are still a few things hanging around.
I have these queued:
aio-fix-buggy-put_ioctx-call-in-aio_complete-v2.patch
kexec-avoid-migration-of-already-disabled-irqs-ia64.patch
net-smc911x-match-up-spin-lock-unlock.patch
rtc-pcf8563-detect-polarity-of-century-bit-automatically.patch
alpha-fix-epoll-syscall-enumerations.patch
revert-blockdev-direct-io-back-to-2619-version.patch
scsi-sd-udev-accessing-an-uninitialized-scsi_disk-results-in-a-crash.patch
altix-more-acpi-prt-support.patch
which I'll get through to Linus later today.  Plus:
- x86_64-irq-simplfy-__assign_irq_vector.patch and
  x86_64-irq-handle-irqs-pending-in-irr-during-irq-migration.patch which
  are big and scary.  Am awaiting feedback from Andi and Eric on what to do
  with these.
- A fix from Trond for 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7923.
 
  Am awaiting acks to merge that.
- sky2-flow-control-off.patch from shemminger which I assume Linus will
  be merging anyway.
- v9fs_vfs_mkdir-fix-a-double-free.patch which I guess I'll merge unless
  Eric suddenly nacks it.
- I have r8169-fix-a-race-between-pci-probe-and-dev_open.patch floating
  about, but I forget its status.  
- I have efi-x86-pass-firmware-call-parameters-on-the-stack.patch, but
  I'm not sure it's right and unless something really rapid happens, we'll
  ship with that bug unfixed.
- enable-mouse-button-23-emulation-for-x86-macs.patch looks simple
  enough, but I'm waiting for Ben to wake up.
- x86-fix-vdso-mapping-for-aout-executables.patch probably works OK, but
  Andi points out that it'd be better to implement this with
  attribute-weak.  So I guess 2.6.20 will ship with non-functional a.out on
  i386, like 2.6.29.
