I get a similar problem with bzImage on one of my systems, with
the exception that I don't see the above error message. Debugging
showed that the problem ONLY occurs if the bzImage code is an
exact multiple of 16k in size when compressed, and thus that it
is not exclusively a BIOS problem.
As far as I can tell, when this occurs, the code to copy the boot
code to the 1M mark is getting things wrong in this case. My
investigations suggest that it fails to copy the second and
seventh 16k block from disk to memory in this case, but I can't
be certain about this.

In this case, the machine is a 386dx/40 with 32M of RAM and a
1.5G hard drive, and serves as my network print server. As a
result, the feature set installed basically consists of an ISA
NE2000 network adapter, the parallel port and printer drivers,
and just sufficient extra to enable ghostscript to run.
Best wishes from Riley.
