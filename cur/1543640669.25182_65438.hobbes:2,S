The correct code has two potential branches instead of one and also
need to stack one register when I have them in functions, but that might
change if the function is inlined in add_timer_randomness().
I can shave off a few instruction if I don't scale it to ns but instead
transform it to a plain 25MHz counter which is what we want anyway I guess.
BTW: I think the trust_pct approach looks nice adn I hope it gets included.
