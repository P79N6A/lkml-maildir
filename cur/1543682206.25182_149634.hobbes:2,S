Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.22-pre6-ac1 add five USB help texts to Configure.help
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/18/266

This patch adds help texts for the following:
CONFIG_USB_BRLVGER
CONFIG_USB_KBTAB
CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_EDGEPORT_TI
CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_KEYSPAN_MPR
CONFIG_USB_SPEEDTOUCH
The patch was made for 2.4.22-pre6-ac1, but can be applied to Marcelo's
tree if the first hunk for CONFIG_USB_SPEEDTOUCH is removed.  Help for
that option is already in Marcelo's Configure.help.  This patch places
that help text in the same position (following USB_DSBR) as in Marcelo's
tree.
The help texts were obtained from the 2.6 Kconfig usb file.
