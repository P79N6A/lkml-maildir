Easy. You have a user-program open the device and send it
parameters via ioctl(). That's the way it's supposed to be
done in a Unix environment. Devices get their parameters via
ioctls.
I have modules that get the entire contents of ASICs from
the contents of user-mode files. Something, at some time,
needs to `insmod` the module anyway. The exact same procedure
that does that can run a program that configures the module
dynamicaly, based, not only on the contents of files, but also
anything else. Do not make hacks to read files from the kernel.
Cheers,
