Why do you start an ad hominem attack every time somebody shows you're
wrong for technical reasons?

It has no relevance. st_dev holds the device number of the device
containing the file. That means that if /dev/hda (3,01) is on /dev, it
contains the device number of filesystem of /dev, 0x0b in my case (udev
using tmpfs):
  root@arthur:/home # stat /dev/hda
    File: `/dev/hda'
    Size: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   block special file
  Device: bh/11d  Inode: 548         Links: 1     Device type: 3,0
  [...]
If I create that same special file "hda" in /home, I get:
  root@arthur:/home # mknod hda b 3 0
  root@arthur:/home # stat hda
    File: `hda'
    Size: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   block special file
  Device: 308h/776d       Inode: 3026        Links: 1     Device type: 3,0
  [...]
It's the same device because st_rdev is the same in both cases, it just
lives on a different filesystem. You can use either device to operate
on.
