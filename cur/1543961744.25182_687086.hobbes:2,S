Yeah, ascii-only is a crappy design. :-/ 
I don't know if mandriva is broken by design - I only use debian.
It would not surprise me if some distros  botch utf-8 through negligence.
They are based in english-speaking countries and have their biggest
user bases there - the majority of their customers aren't going to use 
more than
ascii so why should they bother. 
Someone made a "cool" terminal emulator? Transparency and effects?
Distribute it, despite the fact that it won't work in all cases.
Distro contains xterm anyway for those that need a fallback.
Machine owner thinks one terminal emulator is enough and
install the default or cool one only.

I don't see how wrong characters are better than backspace eating
the prompt or 80-col overflowing when it shouldn't. It is all breakage 
either way.
Stuff break if TERM is set wrong for the terminal in use too, or if the
app in use don't _use_ the TERM variable. This happens too, and you only
notice if the app runs on  a terminal incompatible with TERM=linux.

Amusing and accurate. I use Norwegian which has 3 non-ascii vowels. As well
as some accented characters, but they don't crop up in _every other 
sentence_.

It had to be done in an ascii-compatible way. That way, a userland 
containing
a mix of ascii-only apps,  fully utf-8 supporting apps, and apps with 
partial
utf-8 support will work flawlessly for ascii-only stuff. Like C source and
english language tools. Of course utf-8 only works in the apps 
supporting it,
but utf-8 users keeps fixing this in the apps they need.
Breaking ascii compatibility was not an option, because that means
replacing the entire userland in one operation.  That cannot be done
unless a single authority control everything, and the open source world
isn't like that.
Variable length encoding is necessary, given that:
* Ascii should work as before, i.e. one "char" per ascii character
* One single encoding so a plain text file can contain the symbols of
   any writing system in use. There are way more than 256 symbols.

No, I don't have a utf-8 patch for vt320 terminals. Using one is your 
choice.
Either you don't work with utf-8 stuff on it, or you
use intermediate software that translate the utf-8 to something the
terminal can display in an acceptable matter.

If you _cannot_ accept utf-8, then your computer world will shrink with 
time.
Or you can live with a few things you don't like - most of us have to, 
given that
the computer world has so many people with differing opinions.
