It works on startup... Why should it become misconfigured during
use? The only thing I can think of is that something is touching the
programmable setup... 
Looking through 8390.c, I see:
/* Remove one frame from the ring.  Boundary is always a page behind. */
 
this_frame = inb_p(e8390_base + EN0_BOUNDARY) + 1;
if (this_frame >= ei_local->stop_page)
        this_frame = ei_local->rx_start_page;
/* Someday we'll omit the previous, iff we never get this message.
   (There is at least one clone claimed to have a problem.)  */
if (ei_debug > 0  &&  this_frame != ei_local->current_page)
        printk(KERN_ERR "%s: mismatched read page pointers %2x vs %2x.\n",
                   dev->name, this_frame, ei_local->current_page);
Well... I guess you can't ommit it just yet (not that it helps much
- it still crashes).

Again - sounds like something messed up the settings. But what??? Linux
of course, as it should prevent any other programs from accessing the
card.
Something I just noticed. When warm rebooting from a crash, I get the following
message:
Sep 28 08:47:50 snoopy kernel: ne.c:v1.10 9/23/94 Donald Becker (becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov)
Sep 28 08:47:50 snoopy kernel: NE*000 ethercard probe at 0x300: 00 40 33 29 11 55
Sep 28 08:47:50 snoopy kernel: eth0: NE2000 found at 0x300, using IRQ 3.
But my card is 0x340 on IRQ 15!!!!
Whats special about 0x300 and 3?
This is how it should look:
Sep 28 08:53:39 snoopy kernel: ne.c:v1.10 9/23/94 Donald Becker (becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov)

Sep 28 08:53:39 snoopy kernel: eth0: NE2000 found at 0x340, using IRQ 15.
Something really screwy there!
Some signature, so it really does look like it has been reconfigured.

No, the disk is not PnP. To configure it, you boot DOS, run a special
program that allows you to setup IO and IRQ values, and optionally save
them to EEPROM.
I don't have the foggiest idea how these cards are programmed (how
can the software program it when it doesn't know its IO address in
advance???). I think other cards do the same thing though.

All settings look conservative (perhaps too conservative) to me:
Auto Configuration    : Enabled
AT Bus Clock          : PCICLKI/4         (this is as slow as it will get)
DRAM Read Wait States : 2
DRAM Write Wait Sates : 1
Cache Burst Read      : 2-1-1-1
Internal Cache WB/WT  : Write Thru
External Cache WB/WT  : Write Back
[...]
Ext-Cache with Dirty Bit : Yes
I think that is everything relevant. There are more settings for PCI.
CPU Clock / PCI Clock : 1 : 1
This computer is 100MHz. Does that really mean that the PCI Clock is
100MHz. This sounds so unrealistic (compared with the age of this
computer), I will just assume I am mistaken

I have another ne2k card, some brand. It seems to work fine in another
computer, but that might just be since it isn't transmitting as much (it
was receiving the data at the time the transmitting device failed). I
think I previously swapped the cards with the same result. Should I try
again (just to make sure)?
Also, I have a 3Com Etherlink III card (not mine, but at least I can
use it for testing). Maybe I should try it??? (After I work out how to
program it).

Does that card use 8390.o??? (eg like NE2k?) Just curious.

How do you fix the problem? Does warm reset help? cold reset? Removing
the PCMCIA card and replacing it? What PCMCIA chipset do you have?
I don't understand much about PCMCIA autoconfig, but if this is the same
problem, it doesn't look like my problem is due to the configuration
being currupted...
Is PCMCIA configuration likely to become currupted?
