My laptop has a dodgy trackpoint attached to the passthrough port,
although the touchpad works fine.  Before 2.6.1 this didn't matter,
because whether by accident or design, the passthrough was disabled.
Does this patch disable the passthrough port by default?  If not,
would it be possible to add a boot parameter or something to allow it
to be disabled?
