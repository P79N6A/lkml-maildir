Actually, you can send invalid packets. root has the ability to do so
with raw sockets.
ioctl's are really no different.

Not the point. I don't think anyone disagrees that a small patch to fix
accidental hardware destruction is good.
However, Andre is trying to say that this will fix the problem forever.
This is absolutely incorrect. root is god. He can do anything. He can
reimplement this ioctl call in several different ways that you cannot
stop.
Fixing bugs is nice, but don't pretend it fixes things it doesn't.
This would only fix accidental problems. It only makes it harder to fry
your HD. It does not solve it completely.
