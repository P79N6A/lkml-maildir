hello, everyone
I'm looking for method of call to EFI-RuntimeService, under DOS env.
in my understanding, if i get an entry-point of EFI-RuntimeService,
 i can call to EFI-RT. 
I am reading linux kernel(2.4.14) source code , to find how to get 
an entry-point of EFI-RuntimeService.
and I found it in 'efi_systab' member of ia64_boot_param.
but, i can't find code efi_systab is initialize with phisical addresses.
please tell me how do I get entry-point for EFI-RuntimeService functions as
 linux-kernel do it, or where it.
i'd read section Overview of EFI-specification1.02 but, i can't found they...
# i'm sorry that my lisp...
