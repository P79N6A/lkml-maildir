it was Linus who decreed this to be the standard;)

yes, and most of the time you want to compile against the currently
running kernel, at which point `uname -r` comes in handy; for other
kernels you just change the path a bit.
make install and make modules_install make the symlink right already....
it's a 99% solution, sure, but it's ok for all but a few cases.
