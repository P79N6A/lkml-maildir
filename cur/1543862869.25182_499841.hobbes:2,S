Hi Eric,
In physical destination mode, the destination APIC is determined by 
APIC ID and in logical destination mode, destination apics are determined
by the configurations based on LDR and DFR registers in APIC (Depending
on Flat mode or cluster mode).
Looks like previously one supported only 4bit apic ids if system is
operating in physical mode and 8bit ids if IOAPIC is put in logical
destination mode. That's why, struct IO_APIC_route_entry is containing
4bits for physical apic id.
http://www.intel.com/design/chipsets/datashts/290566.htm
And now newer systems have switched to 8bit apic ids in physical mode.
That's why if somebody is crashing on a cpu whose apic id is more than
16, kexec/kdump code will fail as 4bits are not sufficient.
Hence above change makes sense. Given the fact that logical and physical
apic id is basically a union, it will work even for older systems where
physical apic ids were 4bits only.
OTOH, I think down the line we can get rid of physical dest
field all together in struct IO_APIC_route_entry and use logical dest
field.
Thanks
Vivek
