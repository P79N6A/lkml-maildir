Looking at the ext2 code, that's obviously the case. 
However, looking some more, it's also obviously the case that the ext2
code is being really really bad at doing this, and has a ton of
assumptions about not only how bforget() used to work, but also about how
find_buffer() works.
In particular, as far as I can tell, ext2fs will _busywait_ for the buffer
becoming unlocked if it was locked. Uhhuh. Shades of Windows NT.
And I can't even blame anybody: back when that code was written,
brelse() used to be rather inefficient and do a "wait_on_buffer()" that
caused us to re-schedule if the buffer was locked. Since then, the buffer
handling has been cleaned up quite a bit, and now the loop is just a busy
loop in kernel space.
But it's certainly an example of a filesystem that is being rather
incestuous with the VFS layer, abusing undocumented knowledge of just
exactly how brelse() and bforget() used to work (and in this case about
exactly what the limitations were). 
Anyway, it's probably not a serious problem, because even when it does
busy-wait, it eventually does the right thing so it's not actually a
correctness bug, and the busy-wait should be so rare as to not really be a
performance issue either. 
I should probably just remove the re-try logic, and change the busy loop
to do a "wait_on_bh()" instead (because we do need to wait on the buffer,
otherwise we'd mark the thing free without having finished all the IO on
the disk, which has similar race conditions - except now the races are on
the disk platter instead of in kernel data structures).
