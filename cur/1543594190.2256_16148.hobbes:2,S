Well, it seems that problem is not in muted device ->
before starting realproducer :
# aumix -q
vol 94, 94
pcm 94, 94
speaker 0, 0
line 93, 93, R
mic 0, 0, P
cd 0, 0, P
pcm2 0, 0
igain 0, 0, P
line1 0, 0, P
phin 0, 0, P
phout 0, 0
video 0, 0, P
after starting realproducer :
# aumix -q
vol 94, 94
pcm 50, 0
speaker 0, 0
line 93, 93, R
mic 0, 0, P
cd 0, 0, P
pcm2 0, 0
igain 0, 0, P
line1 0, 0, P
phin 0, 0, P
phout 0, 0
video 0, 0, P
if I get back those values with aumix I still don't get audio from radio device so it
must be something with bt8x8 radio part ->
# radio 88.1 <> /dev/null 
open /dev/radio: Device or resource busy
Gerd, can you help here please !?
