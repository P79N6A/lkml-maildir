I added it, with a warning in the documentation and changelog
Also all the other patches except for the #DF one. Thanks.
BTW I think there is a reasonable cheap way to avoid the interrupt race: 
If pda->irqcount was split into two 16bit words and irq entry code increases the upper 
16bit word (that should be nearly free because because both are in L1 cache; 
with some luck the CPU can even dual-issue). Then the traps code could save
the irq count early and then in the no_context case disable interrupts,
compare and only print LER if there were no interrupts inbetween.
