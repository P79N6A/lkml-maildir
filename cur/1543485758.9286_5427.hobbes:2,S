Hello all.
This is *not* kernel related, but rather kernel-list related. This
should've gone to the maintainer of lkml, but I am not too sure who
(s)he is, as different people seem to be doing different things.
The problem is this: I cannot post to the list using my POP account
from the uni. I can, however, reach anybody else using that account.
Does the list filter out in any way messages coming from
hal.famaf.unc.edu.ar
or famaf.fis.uncor.edu? At least in December I was able to post no
problem, and I believe the problem started about mid January. If
If there's anything I should look out for in my current setup, please
let me know.
John.
