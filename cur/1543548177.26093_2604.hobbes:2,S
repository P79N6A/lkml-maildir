FWIW, this can be done with relatively low overhead by creating a
miscelaneous character device, and just using write() to write in the
arguments.  This is a bit worse than passing things through registers,
but doesn't seem all that bad.
Nonetheless, having some entries in the syscall table that are
designated as "dynamically allocatable" would be a nifty trick.  If the
kernel managed these, modules coluld safely grab a few at load time, and
then declare which indices to use via a /proc file.
