Subject: [OFFTOPIC] Surprise MS endorsement of Linux on BBC radio 4

I was pleased to turn on my radio the other day and hear a Linux
report on BBC Radio 4, including an interview with Eric Raymond.
Imagine my surprise when the European Marketing director from
Microsoft came on and said "Our aim is to try and make our products as 
good as the linux products or better".  Sounds like yet another
unintentional glowing endorsement from the boys at the big corporation 
we all love to hate.
