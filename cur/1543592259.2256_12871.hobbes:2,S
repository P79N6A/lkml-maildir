Indeed.  And let me just throw out another thought.  A clean abstraction
of the various portions of the PPP functionality is beneficial in other
ways.  My personal pet project being to add L2TP support to the kernel
eventually.  A good abstraction of the framing capabilities and basic
PPP processing would be rather useful in that project.

I would agree that such a project would be 2.5 material.
I'll try to keep up with things on the list, but if this goes off-list,
I would appreciate being kept in the loop if possible.  :)  Thanks!
