I know at least that the Bluetooth TTY emulation (RFCOMM) will break
since I have a big fat warning in my code:
        /* We don't leak this refcount. For reasons which are not entirely
           clear, the TTY layer will call our ->close() method even if the
           open fails. We decrease the refcount there, and decreasing it
           here too would cause breakage. */
        dev = rfcomm_dev_get(id);
        if (!dev)
                return -ENODEV;
Regards
Marcel
