Hi,
Here are some i2c driver fixes for 2.6.0-test3.  They include a fix for
the i2c-dev driver that has gone into 2.4 and a pii4x bugfix from Tom
Rini.  I've also added adapter and client "name" files in sysfs as the
driver core no longer supplies them.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/i2c-2.5
thanks,
greg k-h
