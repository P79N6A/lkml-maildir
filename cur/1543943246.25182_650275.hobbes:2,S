Hmm, if you told me it got lost somewhere, sorry.

Ok we can keep the HPET check if that makes you more happy.

The list only contains IDs where the override should be ignored; so
if it has a correct one and it's not there everything is fine.
I'm appending a revised patch. Does it work for you?

Replace nvidia timer override quirk with pci id list v2
[This patch was originally in the old ff tree and was intended for .24; but
somehow got lost in the arch merge. Has also shipped with OpenSUSE 10.3.
I think it should go into .25] 
This replaces the old NF3/NF4 reference BIOS timer override quirk with a device 
ID list. We need to ignore the timer override on these systems, but not 
ignore it on NF5 based systems. Previously this was distingushed by checking
for HPET, but a lot of BIOS vendors didn't enable HPET in their pre Vista 
BIOSes.
Replace the old "for all of nvidia" quirk with a quirk containing pci device
ID. I goobled this list together from pci.ids and googling and it may be 
incomplete, but so far I haven't had complaints.
I also straightened out the ifdef jungle a bit.
v1->v2: Readd the HPET check to handle a NF4 system of Prakash Punnoor.
	This means with HPET we always assume timer overrides are ok.
