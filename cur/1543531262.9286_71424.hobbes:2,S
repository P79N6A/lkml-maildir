G'day all,
be gentle, I'm not a C programmer by any standard,
this patch is a modified version of the same patch in the ALSA
drivers to enable the audio amp on a Gateway 2000 Solo 2150 Laptop.
Please take this with a grain of salt, it works for me..
Does not solve the strange codec/pci problems I'm having though.
