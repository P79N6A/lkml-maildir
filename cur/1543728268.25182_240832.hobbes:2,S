No, it really checks the _pointer_ for NULL. 
A NULL ptr means that it's not a pread interface, but that we should use 
f_pos. It's for when the user doesn't pass in any ppos thing: see 
sys_sendfile() for the two cases.

Yes, this part is probably worth doing. It's probably _also_ worth doing
something similar for the in-file f_pos thing (ie pass in a copy of f_pos
the same way read/write does these days).
