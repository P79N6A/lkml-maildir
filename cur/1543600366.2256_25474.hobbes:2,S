Hi,
You may use pseudo-terminals (pty) to pass open/close/read/write/ioctl requests
to user space.
Your monitoring application opens master side of the pseudo terminal and
monitored application opens slave side.
Ptys are mainly used to redirect serial device communications (tty) to user
space but they can also be used to emulate other types of devices.
Check pty man pages for details.
Hope this helps
