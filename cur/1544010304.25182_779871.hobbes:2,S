But, there are also no arguments to implement it not in userspace.

I agree with Stephane. There are already many different PMU
descriptions depending on family, model and steppping and with *every*
new cpu revision you will get one more update. Implementing this in
the kernel would require kernel updates where otherwise no changes
would be necessary.
If you look at current pmu implementations, there are tons of
descriptions files and code you don't want to have in the kernel.
Also, a profiling tool that needs a certain pmu feature would depend
then on its kernel implementation. (Actually, it is impossible to have
a 100% implementation coverage.) If the pmu could be programmed from
userspace, the tool could provide the feature itself.

At least this would require a kernel with modules enabled.

It does not make sense to close the eyes to reality. There are systems
where it is not possible to update the kernel frequently. Probably you
have one running yourself.
