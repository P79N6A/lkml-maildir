As I said, YMMV. I haven't been able to find a single set of
parameters for the demo program which cause the problem to occur 100%
of the time on all systems.
In general, boosting the MAINTHREAD_PRIORITY even more and increasing
the WAKE_HZ should exaggerate the problem. These parameters reproduce
the problem very reliably on my system:
#define NUM_BUSY_THREADS            2
#define MAINTHREAD_PRIORITY       -20
#define MAINTHREAD_WAKE_HZ       1024
#define MAINTHREAD_LOAD_PERCENT     5
#define MAINTHREAD_LOAD_CYCLES      2
It's also possible this problem doesn't occur on 2.6.17. I have only
tested this example on 2.6.23.1 and 2.6.20 so far.
Thanks,
