That's a fair point. The "noprefix" option was really only added for
backwards-compatibility when mounting as the "cpuset" filesystem type,
so it shouldn't end up getting used directly. But you're right that
this does mean that populate can fail and we should handle that, or
else make the "noprefix" option only usable from within the kernel
when mounting cpusets.
