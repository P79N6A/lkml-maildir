Right now I have one vga card in my system. I wanted to test to see if
mdacon initialization would failed if the system lacked a mda card. For
my system it didn;t fail but seen my vga card as a mda card :-( I also
wanted to test this so if I do have vga and mda card that the mdacon
driver doesn't go for the wrong card. 
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
