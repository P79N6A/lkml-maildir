That's a start, but the 2.5 modutils don't handle them ...

Those won't work with the current 2.5 module syscalls though ...
the latest 2.5-usable modutils seems to be
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/module-init-tools-0.7.tar.bz2
but I've seen comments on LKML referring to a "0.8" version with
essential bugfixes.
