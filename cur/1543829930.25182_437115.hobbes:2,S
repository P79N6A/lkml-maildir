Subject: [Suspend2][ 1/2] [Suspend2] Disable load updating during suspending.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Suspend2 uses the cpu very intensively, with the result that the load
average can be quite high when a cycle has just completed. This in turn can
cause problems with mail delivery and other activities that suspend
activities when the load average gets too high. To avoid this, we suspend
updates of the load average while the freezer is on.
