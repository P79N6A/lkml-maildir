This is intentional behavior.  Otherwise, if it were entered into the routing
table, it would remain there essentially permanently (unless forced out by
a 'route -f' command or perhaps another ICMP redirect).  In general, if
your default router is telling you to go someplace else, one of two situations
applies:
1) This is a temporary condition caused by a router flap, in which case we
should only cache it, so later we will re-learn a better path.
2) The router is trying to tell you that you should be fixing your routing
table, either by adding static routes or running a full routing protocol.
