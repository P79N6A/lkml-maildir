Hi,
On 
http://www.rhdv.cistron.nl/sigqueue.html
 you will find a patch adds the
capability to cloned processes to have a shared signal queue. This enables
the LinuxThreads implementation of POSIX threads to have POSIX compliant
signal delivery behaviour.
In order to POSIX compliant, signals sent to a threaded program can be
received by any thread. Currently, a signal sent to one of the threads of
such a program is received only by that thread.
Attached you will find the patch. I have gzipped it because it is 100 kB
uncompressed.
On the web page I have written some more about the specific
implementation.
	Robert
