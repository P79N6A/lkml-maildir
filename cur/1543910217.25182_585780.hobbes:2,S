That's the tradeoff:  optimize for development boards, or
instead for more fixed-function product boards.

That's not uncommon, although I'm more used to seeing the
on-chip ROMs relying on a second stage loader for stuff like
getting memory and other clocks going at optimal speeds,
and loading "big" images (that won't fit on-chip SRAM).
