I just checked the BIOS' between the two machines and
there was one slight difference.  Working machine I
had serial port turned off and the parallel port setup
differently, so I made changes to the broken machines
BIOS so they are identical.  After making the change I
checked 'lspci -vvv' on the broken one and it's the
same output as before.  
I tested the Marvell interface to see if it made any
difference and the line died after about a second of
transfering data.  dmesg reported this:
sky2 eth1: enabling interface
sky2 eth1: ram buffer 0K
sky2 eth1: Link is up at 100 Mbps, full duplex, flow
control both
sky2 0000:04:00.0: error interrupt status=0x80000000
sky2 eth1: hw error interrupt status 0x8
sky2 eth1: MAC parity error
sky2 0000:04:00.0: error interrupt status=0x80000000
sky2 eth1: hw error interrupt status 0x8
sky2 eth1: MAC parity error
sky2 eth1: disabling interface
