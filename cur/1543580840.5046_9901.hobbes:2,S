Subject: [UPDATE] Zerocopy 2.4.1 rev 3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/2/3/6

You know where to get it:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davem/zerocopy-2.4.1-3.diff.gz
Fixes:
1) pskb_expand_tail could corrupt SKB frag lists in some
   cases, leading to OOPS
2) Need to check for out of window data even in the
   partial packet cases of tcp_data_queue
3) Merged in some small net fixes from the AC patches.
As of this moment, I know of no bugs (ie. corrupts data or crashes
kernel) in the zerocopy patches.
Some people have asked me about making a patch against the AC
patches.  It is doable, but would be quite a bit of work for me.
If someone would like to do this and put those patches up somewhere,
they can feel free to do so.  Just let everyone on linux-kernel
and netdev know about it.  Probably, after the next zerocopy patch
revision, I will ask Alan to add the zerocopy stuff to his tree
anyways.  Things really look good right now.
Thanks.
Later,
David S. Miller
