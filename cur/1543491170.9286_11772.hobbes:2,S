Subject: Linux 2.2.x kernel pre-patches don't use EXTRAVERSION Makefile variable

Linux 2.2.0-pre1 added the Makefile variable 'EXTRAVERSION' which
allowed
to append a string to the kernel version, such as "-pre1", "-ac1", ...
While EXTRAVERSION has been used to donate a pre-patch in the 2.2.0-pre
series
and is used in Alan Cox's kernel patches, it does not appear to be used
in Linus's
current kernel pre-patches. Can someone please enlighten me why is this
so?
