Please don't forget:
  *     without an extremely good reason, they don't want to spend the
        time and money involved in writing and distributing the
        documentation and sample code needed to interface with their card.

You'll have to sell the company on the idea, and I mean that quite
literally. A company exists to make a product, and it has to make money to
continue to exist so that it can continue to make that product. You have
to show them how documenting the hardware is a net win for them. Telling
them that you won't buy their product for X reason isn't very focussed --
there are billions of people in the world who won't be buying their
product.
