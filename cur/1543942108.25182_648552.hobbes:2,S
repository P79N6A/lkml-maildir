the surprise also will be when gcc reorders your .data section for optimization,
and the variable you think is last.. no longer isn't.

it's for sure only few; this is the second known case is 5 years
that made this dicey assumption (RHEL/Fedora ship with this for 5 years or so now)
Various "secure" distros ship with brk detached as well (albeit via other methods)
for even longer.

sadly elfnotes are a sparse commodity.

setarch works. If the apps come in source form they need fixing anyway (since I'd not be
surprised of current gcc reorders variables), if not.. we only have 2 cases,
the other case was the build process of emacs (which got fixed 5 years ago).
My personal guess is, if there's nothing more than "columns", lets swallow it.
If more show up, we need to rethink it. I somehow doubt more real apps will show
up given how widespread and long this patch was deployed... but turning of randomization
already exists via various methods, both global and per process.
