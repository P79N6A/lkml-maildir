Yep, they're queued up for 2.6.19.  Since it was a race found
only on testing with a ramdisk (iirc) it didn't really seem to
me like they needed to be rushed through for a 2.6.18-rc.  The
race has also been there for the entire lifetime of the Linux
XFS port... so, not urgent (and not risk free either).
cheers.
