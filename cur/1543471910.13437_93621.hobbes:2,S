If I may chip in...
(1) is not too relevant, we should strive for the cleanest source
    (including Makefiles) possible. Question is, is this a real cleanup?
    BTW, you can arrange for "directory static" (not C's "file static")
    symbols this way, if needed. Is this relevant?
    Sure, it's a lot of work.
(2) is a killer. But then, why is there unneeded stuff in the *.a's? Sure,
    I can think of situations where it does make sense. Are they present
    here? 
(3) again, a good point.
