Haven't heard of it before. Will look into it. But I doubt it will help
pinpoint the semaphore holder, if all I can do is sysrq stuff.

Very good! Yes, I left out that piece of detail in my original posting.
There is a real low priority (4) SCHED_FIFO (hence still higher than any
SCHED_OTHER) task spinning. But it is not the semaphore holder. I am
trying to identify which kernel thread (because that's most likely)
running at SCHED_OTHER real low priority (too nice) is holding the
semaphore, locking out a priority 50 SCHED_FIFO task in its sys_write()
as a result.
Thanks
