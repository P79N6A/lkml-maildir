Subject: [PATCH 000 of 4] knfsd: revised patches to fix IPv6/sunrpc link error and other fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/5/486

Revised version of previous patches:
 - Fixed the 'nfsd hang when stopped' problem
 - Dropped the 'avoid checking udp checksum' as I'm no longer convinced it is
   the right way to go.
 - Added a paranoia check that the control message returned by recvfrom
   is in-fact a PKTINFO message.
Tested that a udp mount still works, and the the nfsd server can be stopped and
restarted successfully.  Found that it still doesn't if there is active
traffic so fixed that.
Also patch from Greg Banks to make the thread-pool stuff non-default as
it is not optimal on all machines, and often needs tuning where it can
be optimal.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
