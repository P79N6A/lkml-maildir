Hello brethren,
Thank you for all the replies I received. However, since all of them were
incorrect, I feel it is my duty to clarify the situation and answer my own
question as I have figured it out at home where I examined the source more
closely.
The trick here is done via module_init()/module_exit() macros which for a
module (if MODULE defined) evaluates to the
init_module()/cleanup_module(), i.e. init_elf_binfmt()/exit_elf_binfmt()
become init_module()/cleanup_module().
If the module (i.e. compilation unit) is compiled into the kernel
statically, then module_init() generates some static variable which is
initialized with the return value of the function. And module_exit(), of
course, generates /* Nothing */ :)
Very impressive but not immediately obvious.
Regards,
