well...
to be honest, I need my computer to work during usual daily business
at the moment I can afford to do a compile and test a new kernel once a day,
but if it introduces instabilities that make my computer unusable for
productive work (which means programming, running heavy java applications
and  and TeXing) I can't run it for more than a few minutes.
I started a bisection last weekend but had to give up after three
compile-reboot cycles.
so, please don't expect too much, but I will do my best to help
