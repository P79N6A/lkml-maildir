-ETOOMUCHMAGIC.  We should either expose all the XX interfaces (but this isn't 
a high-speed interface, so let's not) or not "sometimes" convert endianness.  
Getting surprises because a field happens to be packed into 4 bytes is 
counter-intuitive.
Since your most trivial implementation is to do a byte at a time, I don't 
think you have a good argument on that basis either.
Cheers,
Rusty.
