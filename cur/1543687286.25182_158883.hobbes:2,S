It's unfortunate if there are some keyboards that only work properly
in one mode, and others that need the other mode, given that there is
no way to automatically detect which keyboard is which.
If your keyboard requires Set 3 to operate fully, how does it behave
under Windows?  I think it was Andries who said Windows uses translated set 2.
