There is hardly anything interesting remaining in 
arch/powerpc/kernel/binfmt_elf32.c after your patch.
Do you think it's reasonable to go one step further and
turn the file into a completely generic fs/binfmt_elf32.c
that can be used by all 32/64 compat architectures?
I tried that in the past, but failed because I don't
really understand enough of the ELF loader to know
which architectures do it right and which don't -- I only
saw them all being very different in this file ;-)
