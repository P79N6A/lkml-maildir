I'm unable to access any USB devices on a 4 port USB hub in 2.5; it
works fine in 2.4.
Initially /proc/bus/usb/devices will list all devices, including those
(printer,scanner,camera) on the hub as well as the directly connected
USB mouse.
A simple program to open the scanner device gives:
 Unable to open scanner device: No such device
Unplugging/Plugging the hub or its devices gives a load of log
messages like:
drivers/usb/core/hub.c: usb_hub_port_status(00:07.2-1) failed (err = -110)
drivers/usb/core/hub.c: new USB device 00:07.2-1.3, assigned address 6
drivers/usb/image/scanner.c: probe_scanner: User specified USB scanner -- Vendor:Product - 4b8:110
drivers/usb/core/hub.c: usb_hub_port_status(00:07.2-1) failed (err = -110)
drivers/usb/core/hub.c: usb_hub_port_status(00:07.2-1) failed (err = -110)
drivers/usb/core/hub.c: usb_hub_port_status(00:07.2-1) failed (err = -110)
drivers/usb/core/hub.c: usb_hub_port_status(00:07.2-1) failed (err = -110)
Is this a known problem ? Further info on request. Back to 2.4, where
it all works.
