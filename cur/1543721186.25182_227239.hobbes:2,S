I'm slightly scared of this.  Historically, there's already pressure
from boot loader people on ARM to include random file formats to suit
their own boot loaders.
In the first place, ARM had Image and zImage and that was it.  It was
well defined.  Then people decided that gzipped Image would be nice
and they'd merge the zlib code into their boot loader.  I think there's
even some people who use gzipped zImage...!
Then ARMboot came along and we eventually ended up with uboot-style
wrappings to support uboot / ARMboot, which require an external program
to be installed on the host system called "mkimage" (which, incidentally
is an incredibly bad choice of name.)
People also came up with the idea of using the ELF file directly and
having the boot loader parse the ELF file.  I wouldn't put it past
someone to want gzipped ELF as well.
There's also srec to support serially downloaded images as well.
So, in total, we have boot loaders which want:
  - Image
  - zImage
  - gzipped Image
  - gzipped zImage
  - uboot
  - ELF
  - srec
Basically this is somewhere I don't want to go.  My position is that
if boot loaders want to have their own proprietary formats, they
should do whatever manipulation to the kernel image is necessary as
a post processing step themselves from one of the two standard kernel
formats - Image or zImage.
However, the problem of offering users all these options is that their
first question will be "huh, which one of these 7 do I want?" rather
than everyone knowing that they need the kernel build to produce either
an Image or zImage and the boot loader documentation telling them what
to do with it next.
