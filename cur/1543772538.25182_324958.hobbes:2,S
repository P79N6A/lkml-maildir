Sorry Herbert, but both RFC793 page 32 figure 9 and my Linux box disagree
with this statement. Look: at line 5, A rejects the SYN-ACK because the
ACK is wrong during the session setup.
And if you send the SYN-ACK on an established session, either it's in the
window in which case the other end will send an RST, or it's outside the
window, in which case the other end will resend an ACK to tell you what
it expects. So I maintain my statement that the SYN-ACK must be within the
window to cause a session reset. That's why I considered cisco's approach
a total bullshit, because they mangled the TCP implementation to protect
against in-window RSTs, but they failed to see that SYN-ACK would do exactly
the same.
I fail to find a case where both the SEQ and the ACK are ignored. This
is why I believe that the simultaneous connect mode introduces a weakness.
Cheers,
Willy
