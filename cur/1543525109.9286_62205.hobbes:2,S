Thanks Andrea!  (I was thanking you for the release notes, heh).
I was informed by Brian C Doyle that NFSv2 for Linux is broken
when using non-linux NFS clients.  I have applied the patch he suggested,
and so far so good.
Thanks for the info.  The NFS will probably solve what I am seeing NFS
related (oops wise/kernel panic), and it sounds like 2.2.15 will help as well.

Thank Andrea, he figured it out.

The TCP/SMP problem goes back to 2.1.x somewhere. It does cause complete
hangs on SMP boxes, it could be what you see under high load.
