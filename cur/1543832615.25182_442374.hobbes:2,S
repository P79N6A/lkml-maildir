I see the merge window closed and swap prefetch got bypassed again. I'd like 
to believe it was an oversight but far more likely that Andrew remains 
undecided about whether it should go in or not.
No bug reports have come from it in 6 months, the code has remained unchanged 
for 3 months, it is as unobtrusive as a driver that is not compiled in 
when !CONFIGed and there are numerous reports from satisfied users (even ones 
that made it to the scary grounds of lkml). The only thing that happens is 
Nick keeps threatening to review it over and over and over and....
I'm not sure what else needs to happen?
