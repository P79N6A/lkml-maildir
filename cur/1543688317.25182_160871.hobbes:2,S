I have been using this patch for some time now. At HZ=1000, I had to set 
tick=10200 or more to keep ntpd happy (even with the PM timer as a time 
source).
I broke down and changed HZ to 100, and it seems to be holding steady 
(still with the PM timer, though). This leads me to believe that the C2 
idle/resume process takes longer than 1 ms in the worst case.
Wasn't there a patch pending to allow HZ to be changed via the config 
interface?
