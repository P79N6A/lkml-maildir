Hello.
When attempting to boot Linux kernel v2.2.17 from a Compact Flash (CF) device I
am getting the errors shown below.  This CF device is in a PCMCIA form factor
and is the Master device on the secondary IDE controller
Before we get to the errors, though, a little background.  I can reproduce this
boot error on 2 different systems, and have seen the same error messages
(non-booting) on a 3rd system.  For both boot systems the CF device is the only
IDE device and is the Master on the secondary IDE controller (/dev/hdc).  For
the non-booting system the device is in a PCMCIA slot (/dev/hde).
This is what I see at boot time:

Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 16:00
That's it.  I've listed the (U)MSDOS complaints for completeness, but as I get
the same drive_cmd messages when simply inserting the device in a PCMCIA slot
(that is, before attempting to mount any filesystem), I don't think that it is a
factor.
This is definately an OS issue.  I've booted many OSes (DOS, Win95, VxWorks,
LynxOS) from this same configuration (CF = IDE1/Master as the sole IDE device)
and have seen no complaints like the ones shown above.
So... what can I do to work around this problem?  Thank you.
