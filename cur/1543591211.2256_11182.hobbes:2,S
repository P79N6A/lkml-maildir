Yep, sorry that was uml with debugging info.

-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         8656 May 16 20:27 fs/ramfs/ramfs.o
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root        11688 May 16 20:24 mm/shmem.o-tmpfs

That's an -ac kernel, so ramfs does accounting and is a little bigger

So the read/write support in tmpfs is about the same size as ramfs.
