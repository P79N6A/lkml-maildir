I don't keep my emails any more, but you *never* fixed the problems in 
arch/*/kernel/traps.c.
Yes, the kernel/unwind.c issues generally got fixed. The infinite loops in 
the *callers* never did.

Still in denial, I see.
Do you still claim that "the fallback position always did the right 
thing"? Despite the fact that the unwinder had sometimes *corrupted* the 
incoming information so much that the fallback position was the one that 
oopsed? And no, you didn't fix that.
And no, IT DID NOT use probe_kernel_address like you still claim.
Anyway, you work for Suse, I don't care what you do to the Suse kernel. 
Maybe it will get stable some day. Somehow, I doubt it.
