In other times when I implemented this....
You need to be careful on the power-up. Many JBODs share a single
"enclosure" and that enclosure has a limited power supply. If all
drives were spun up in parallel (and a drive may take 10-15seconds
to spin up), then they can overload the enclosure's power limit.
This issue, which normally occurs when an enclosure is first powered
on, was solved by injecting sequence delays based on either jumpers
or delays based on address/slot. But this won't help the software
suspend/resume.
There were not a lot of great answers on how to solve this as it usually
required knowledge of how the hardware was packaged. What we defaulted
to was limiting spin up to never concurrently start more than N drives
on a scsi bus. N defaulted to 1, but allowed the admin to tune it.
