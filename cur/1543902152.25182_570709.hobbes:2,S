Is there any real reason for this?
I think that patch is bogus. Either it should stay at 1, or the whole work 
should be a non-scheduled one instead.
Do we really need to handle it asap for the console, or is it ok to wait 
for the next tick, like the regular tty case used to?
And if we need to handle it asap, why the "delayed"?
