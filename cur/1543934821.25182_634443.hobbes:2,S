If you've got the very latest git, after
	cd linux-2.6/
	echo "* whitespace" >.gitattributes
it'll treat any spaces in initial whitespace that could have been tabs
as bad whitespace, for the purposes of commands like git-am.  (So e.g.
	git-am --whitespace=fix mbox
will rewrite such stuff with tabs.)  For details search for whitespace
in the gitattributes, git-config, and git-apply man pages....
