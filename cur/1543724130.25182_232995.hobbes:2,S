There was a recent security announcment regarding a vulnerability with 
the fchown function.
Only a few distrobutions (red hat/suse) have fixed the issue, but I've 
yet to see a general patch for it.
Information regarding the issue is here:

I searched around the archive databases, but did not come up with it 
(unless I skipped over something accidentaly)
Thank you for your time and appologies if this is a duplicate.
