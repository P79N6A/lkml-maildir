You should be able to run it on any SMP machine assuming you write the
arch specific code (PPC could be used as an example). Of course it isn't
very interesting if the hardware doesn't support hot swap :)
As soon as I get the SMP ultra booting again (I arrived one morning to
hear the disk was making loud grinding noises) I'll code up sparc (ie E10K)
support. It sounds like S390 support will be trivial, I'd love to get my
hands on one of those :)
