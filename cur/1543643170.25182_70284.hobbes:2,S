 If enclosure in "major" distribuitons defines mainline for you, I have 
to agree. Otherwise, how do you get "a  proven track record in 
mainline" without having it in the mainline kernel ? :-)
 In any case, one could always mark XFS as "experimental" for some time.

 sure, if you can live with the fsck time on your 200 GB (or bigger) 
filesystem after the occasional crash.
