If the machine is suppose to support a 32-bit OS, then yeah, it's
a BIOS bug. It all depends on who defines the support matrix.
One way to support that behavior is use u64 in struct resource (ioport.h)
(NOT dma_addr_t) instead of "unsigned long".
The other way is to reassign "invalid" resources (above 4GB) with 
"valid" ones (below 4GB).  I suspect windows is doing this and
I'd rather see linux take this route as well if possible.
