I'm afraid there is no 100% working kernel. Problems were reported as 
far back as 2.6.11, and I never found a single thread in mailing lists 
ending with "problem solved" (not counting PSU and thermal issues).

Unfortunately right now I have no yet-untested machine - both I have 
show same problems.
Time permitting I'll test 2.6.23 kernel, libata-dev branch, 
SATA300/SATA150 modes and agressive card cooling as you suggested in 
your other email and  document all this on a separate page or maybe a wiki.
