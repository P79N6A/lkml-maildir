Per-directory indices of ->d_subdirs. Hash tries (spelled correctly)
and B+ trees hung off dentries corresponding to directories are
plausible. There are plenty of other possibilities; just do it on a
per-directory basis so you don't intermix children of different parents
in some boot-time -allocated global trainwreck and you're home free.
Benchmarking is probably needed to gauge which performs best.
