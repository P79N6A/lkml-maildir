Applications do not care, humans do. :-)
What's about applications they just need to see exactly the same device
after migration. Not only name, but f.e. also its ifindex. If you do not
create a separate namespace for netdevices, you will inevitably end up
with some strange hack sort of VPIDs to translate (or to partition) ifindices
or to tell that "ping -I eth858354 xxx" is too coimplicated application
to survive migration.
