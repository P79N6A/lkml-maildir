Hi,
In checkstack.pl, do you recall the reason for this code snippet:
		if ($size > 0x80000000) {
			$size = - $size;
			$size += 0x80000000;
			$size += 0x80000000;
		}
There is one (unusual:) case where it fails.  Is it needed?
For arch/i386/kernel/efi_stub.S, checkstack reports:
0xc0116f5d efi_call_phys:				1073741824
which is 0x4000_0000 (_ added for readability only), however the
actual change in %esp there is __PAGE_OFFSET (0xc000_0000 on ia32),
so if I alter the "if" test above to check for > 0xf000_0000,
checkstack reports the correct value:
0xc0116f5d efi_call_phys:				3221225472
which is 0xc000_0000.
from objdump of efi_stub.o:
    5:	81 ea 00 00 00 c0    	sub    $0xc0000000,%edx
or I can just ignore it, like I've been doing for awhile...
