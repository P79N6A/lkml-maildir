The above is an example of an application covering up for
a filesystem that breaks the general expactions for the
operating environment. Remember your precursor with a broken
driver who received his beating a couple of months ago.
He also had an appliction which processed his errors from
close just fine. A workaround can be done in every specific
instance, but it does not make this practice any smarter.
What AFS designers should have done if they had a brain larger
than a pea was:
 1. Make close to block indefinitely, retrying writes.
    Allow overlapping writes, let clients to sort it out.
 2. Provide an ioctl to flush writes before close() or
    make fsync() work right. Your "smart" applications have had
    to use that, so that no ambiguity existed between tearing down
    the descriptor and writing out the data.
This way, naive applications such as cat and cc would
continue to work. There is no reason to penalize them just
because some application _could_ possibly post idiotic alerts
(Abort, Retry, Fail).
