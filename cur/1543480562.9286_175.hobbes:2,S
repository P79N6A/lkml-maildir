I have just tried 2.2.0pre6ac2 on my alpha (udb using tgafb (640x480x8),
softcursor, UP kernel), and am getting the same cursor behaviour (several
cursors on the screen after switching, or no cursor at all until I type).
After trying for a few minutes I was able to get one line of text intended
for the heavy-scrolling vc to appear on another vc (to do this I am not
switching back and forth rapidly, I am sitting at the heavy scrolling vc
and waiting for the 'right time' to switch to an idle one..).  I catted
/dev/fb0 to a file after this happened..  It is at
http://blue.netnation.com/~nop/alpha.sdump.gz
 (~1.8k).  I was using
different fonts on the scrolling and idle vcs in this case,
but I was not when this happened on my p100 so I don't think the font
change has to do with the problem.  Let know if you want me to try this on
my sparc..
Thanks,
Kevin
