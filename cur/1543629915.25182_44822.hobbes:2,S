Subject: cmap problems with aty128fb.c

I have been having difficulties with aty128fb.c in 2.5.14.  The
version in Linus' tree crashes on boot for me with a null pointer
dereference in memcpy, called from fb_copy_cmap from gen_set_cmap,
from fbcon_show_logo via the fbops->fb_set_cmap pointer.
At the lowest level the null pointer dereference is caused by a
signed/unsigned bug in fb_copy_cmap.  We are ending up with size > 0
even when to->start and to->len were both zero.  The patch below fixes
that.
At the next level up, the problem seems to be that info->cmap is never
getting initialized.  How and where is it supposed to be initialized?
Paul.
