I don't get it.  The benchmark data isn't explained in plain English
what it means, that I could find, so I am just guessing.  But looking
at the last (17500) column of the fork results, after applying patch
1/9, I see a number of 18565, and looking at that same column in patch
9/9, I see a number of 18142.
I guess that means a drop of (18565 - 18142 / 18565) == 2% in the fork
rate, to make the code "more readable".
And I'm not even sure it makes it more readable.  Looks to me like another
layer of apparatus, which is one more thing to figure out before a reader
understands what is going on.
I'd gladly put in a few long days to improve the fork rate 2%, and I am
grateful to those who have already done so - whoever they are.
Somewhere I must have missed the memo explaining why this patch is a
good idea - sorry.
