As a start, I would slot out 50 Hz, 60 Hz (for people in the US and 
US-engineered power systems in other countries), 4 kHz and 
harmonics.  Actually, if you are sampling at roughly random intervals you 
would get about four to six bits per sample of somewhat random values, and 
that would give you entropy as good as you get from mouse movement.
If someone were playing a CD at the time you were sampling the sound card, 
you would get considerably more bits of entropy, but using the six bottom 
bits would still be useful.
Hey, people, it's just a thought.  Turning lemons into lemonade, if you will.
