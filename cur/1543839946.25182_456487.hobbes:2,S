Every machine has hrtimers - not necessarily with high resolution timer
support, but the core code is there in any case and it is designed to
provide fine grained timers. 
In case of high resolution time support one would expect that the "fine
grained" timer event is actually fine grained.

If you think out your argument then everything which is fine grained or
high responsive should be removed from userspace access for the very
same reason. Please look at the existing users of the hrtimer subsystem
- all of them are exposed to userspace.
