Well ... really no.  Kernel development isn't about distro releases.
Most of them pull from the upstream git trees anyway, so the problem
shouldn't arise.
There's precedent for putting relatively uncontroversial drivers into
the -rc tree.  However, arcmsr has had a rather difficult path into the
kernel.  Moving it into scsi-misc is a signal that it goes from being
out of tree to in-tree candidate (i.e. I'm happy with the quality now,
but I'll give other people a chance to voice concerns), but on a slow
path that allows people time to find problems and fix them.  This path
also dictates a time line for any final objections arising (i.e. up
until 2.6.18 is declared).
