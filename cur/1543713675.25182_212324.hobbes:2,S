more bad news, it did not.
It compiled and the module loaded, but with the error again.
I copied over tht sis-agp.c from 2.6.5-rc3 that was modified with your patches 
last week and AGP is now working again.
I did a diff between the modified sis-agp.c from 2.6.5 (sis-agp.bak, without 
the else) and the working sis-agp.c from 2.6.5-rc3 (now in 2.6.5):
bash-2.05b$ diff 
-u /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/agp/sis-agp.bak /usr/src/linux-2.6.5-rc3/drivers/char/agp/sis-agp.c

Conclusions 
 In a straight-up fight, the Empire squashes the Federation like a bug. Even 
with its numerical advantage removed, the Empire would still squash the 
Federation like a bug. Accept it. -Michael Wong
