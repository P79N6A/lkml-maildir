Yes, there is known problems in egcs (&nbsp;backward compatibles)&nbsp;with
inline
<br>asm (clobber registers). But i compile everything (kernel, glibc)&nbsp;with
<br>pgcc-2.91.60&nbsp;(egcs-1.1.1) even with -O6 and has no problems. Including
<br>2.0.xx series.&nbsp; Just for sure use -O2.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>2.0.xx will _not_ be modified for egcs (too great
risk of instability for
<br>little gain), use gcc-2.7.2.3 with it.</blockquote>
There is a patch - it's attached bellow.
