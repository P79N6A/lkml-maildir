this was just a suggestion. It seems a remote-rlimit syscall is
possible, so there's no need to change Jack if you dont want to - that
syscall enables a utility that will change the rlimit for all running
tasks, so you'll get the 'simplicity of experimentation' of a global
sysctl.
(what you wont get is the ultra-fast time-to-market property of sysctl
hacks. I know that you'd probably prefer a global sysctl that you could
start using tomorrow, and i also know that the global sysctl would
suffice current Jackd needs, but we cannot sacrifice flexibility and
future utility for the sake of a couple of weeks/months of time
advantage...)
