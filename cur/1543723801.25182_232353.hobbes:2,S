It is also _abused_ for less legitimate purposes.

We can at least consider adding BLKPARTSTART and deprecating
HDIO_GETGEO so people at least will know that they should upgrade.

According to szaka the "the new situation" is similar. :(

This is just sick: same ioctl - different returned values.
Please never ever do it again - we can avoid such problems in future.

Yep, 2.7.1 should remove HDIO_GETGEO.
We should have done this in 2.5, really.

What about people running old parted and new vanilla kernels?

What about people using old versions of these tools (if any).
What I'm only worried is that there might be cases when 2.4 worked
and 2.6 doesn't which with combination with bugs in the tools cause
"where is my data?" issue.

Yep.
