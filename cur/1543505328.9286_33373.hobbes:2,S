Hi Jeremy.

I also have an ES1371 on one of my systems, and I discovered that the
ES1371 driver doesn't manage to register its io ports or its irq
unless the ES1370 driver is also present. Not sure why.
I will add that I have still not managed to get it to work, but having
both of the above compiled in at least lets it register its ports...
Best wishes from Riley.
