There's also another project, as of now unknown to most of the world,
to port Linux to a i386 simulator running in user space.  This simulator
runs user processes as usual, and implements privileged instructions
using Unix system calls (MMU -> mmap(), timer interrupt -> setitimer(),
syscalls -> ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL), etc).  Some info about the CPU
simulator can be found at
