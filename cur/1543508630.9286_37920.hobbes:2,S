I agree that it's a hassle. That's why I'd like to see the changes get
into 2.3 which I'd like to see frozen as soon as possible so that we can
have these features in 2.4.

Huh?!?  The only people who limit what goes into the kernels are Linus
and Alan.  What I recommend to my clients does not impose a limitation on
you.

We do all of that. In fact, some of us even read this list. But that does
not make it ok to deliberately break existing functionality within a
"stable" kernel series. Consider that we must often upgrade kernels on an
emergency basis as security vulnerabilities are fixed.
