If you would like to refresh your memory (which is obviously faulty)
you'll see that my involvement in this thread was merely to answer
a simple question about structure sizes.
It was not a bug report about USB breaking.  Therefore, I have no
case to present.
(And WTF do soo many people assume that I'm somehow always reporting
a bloody bug and have to present such cases when I get copied on
emails to answer questions?  I don't understand the stupid mentality
there - this is _not_ the first time this has happened in the 12 days
of 2006 so far.)
