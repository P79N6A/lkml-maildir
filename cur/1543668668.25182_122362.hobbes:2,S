i did some searching around and only found that this
problem started during 2.3.x because of a scsi rewrite
anyways, i did try the loop method, it did not work,
i got a segmentation fault when i did the following:
    losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/scd0
    mount -r -t hfs /dev/loop0 /cdrom
oh well, i'll just use my IDE drive for now..
thx anyways, Nehal
