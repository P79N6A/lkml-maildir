Nobody is forcing you to hit the power switch in the middle of a build. 
But now that you mention it, you've provided a good example of a broken
application.  Make with its reliance on timestamps for determining build
status is both painfully slow and unreliable.  What happens if you
adjust your system clock?  That said, Tux2 can preserve the per-write
atomicity quite easily, or better, make could take advantage of the new
journal-oriented transaction api that's being cooked up and specify its
requirement for atomicity in a precise way.
Do you have any other examples of programs that would be hurt by sudden
termination?  Certainly we'd consider a desktop gui broken if it failed
to come up again just because you bailed out with the power switch
instead of logging out nicely.
