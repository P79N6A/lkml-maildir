> This isn't the right fix:
The cache thing you may be right on. The core fix is not about caching
its about fixing races on IPI replay. We have to handle an IPI reoccuring
potentially with a small time delay due to a retransmit of a message
lost by one party on the bus. Furthermore it seems other messages can
pass the message that then gets retransmitted.

I'm not sure I follow why it explains a missed IPI. Please explain in
more detail.
