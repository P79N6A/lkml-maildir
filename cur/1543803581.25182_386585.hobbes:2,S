Either way, we can remove it from the tree for now.
But I'm almost sure such a user would be wrong too. The reason it is
required is very specific and it is because taking lru_lock and then
looking up a page on the LRU uniquely does not pin the page. If you
find the page via any other means other than simply looking on the
LRU, then get_page_testone is wrong and you should either pin it or
take a normal reference to it instead.
