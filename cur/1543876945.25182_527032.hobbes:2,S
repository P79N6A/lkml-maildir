How do you propose they do that?  Neither kppp nor gnome-ppp seem to
be able to do that currently.  Gnome-ppp offers just /dev/modem and
/dev/ttyS[0123].  Kppp offers those plus a whole pile of others, but
neither found the /dev/ttyPZ[01] that I get with your patch applied.
Gnome-ppp at least let me type in /dev/ttyPZ0, but kppp didn't seem to
have that facility.

Sure I can do that, but that's beyond a non-technical user, who is
precisely the person who won't know (and shouldn't have to know) that
their computer has an 85C30 chip rather than a 16C550, or even what
those numbers refer to.
Paul.
