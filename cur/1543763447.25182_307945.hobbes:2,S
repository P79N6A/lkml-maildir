What are the "proper places"?  What other control paths could be inspecting
the refcount at this time?  (That's the problem with barriers - you can't
tell what they are barriering against).

But there's a time window on entry to cn_queue_wrapper() where the recsount
hasn't been incremented yet, and there's no locking.  If
cn_queue_free_callback() inspects the refcount in that window it will free
the cn_callback_entry() while cn_queue_wrapper() is playing with it?

Not controversial - the timer can have expired and have been successfully
deleted but the work_struct which the timer handler scheduled is still
pending, or has just started to run.
