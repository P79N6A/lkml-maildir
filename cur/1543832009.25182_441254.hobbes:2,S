Yes, it certainly looks like it, idling at full clock speed. But that's a server CPU!
I think this may have to do with latency to get back to useful work.

That's a mobile processor, so I would expect it to use more aggressive
power-saving scheme while idle, at the cost of higher latency to get
back to full speed. 
The good thing about this is that it was not too hard to figure out what is
going using pfmon. Where you specifically looking for this? Is this a documented
behavior of the Turion64?
