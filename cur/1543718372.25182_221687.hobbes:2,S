Step 1: Buy a machine that has 16 CPUs and 32G of memory.
Step 2: cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.6 && make -j20
Step 3: Stand back :)
Seriously - the only way to do a kernel build in 20 seconds is to use 'make
-j20' or so, and have enough processors to handle it, and enough RAM so that
you can basically do the whole thing in the fin-core cache rather than beating
on the disk....
