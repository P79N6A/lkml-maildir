I think it would be fine.  The issue is that currently for directories 
tmpfs doesn't have it's own set of operations--it reuses the 
simple_dir_operations set of file ops from libfs.
We could make a tmpfs-specific set of operations that is identical to 
simple_dir_operations but with the addition of setting the fsync 
function to simple_sync_file().
Alternately, if it makes sense for all the users of 
simple_dir_operations we could modify it directly and all of the other 
users of simple_dir_operations would get the change for free.  I don't 
know enough about the other filesystems to know if this makes sense or not.
