then that would not be just anomaly.h, that would be the entire mach
header subdirs:
include/asm-blackfin/mach-bf533/
include/asm-blackfin/mach-bf535/
include/asm-blackfin/mach-bf537/
include/asm-blackfin/mach-bf561/
relocated to the dirs:
arch/blackfin/mach-bf533/
arch/blackfin/mach-bf535/
arch/blackfin/mach-bf537/
arch/blackfin/mach-bf561/
