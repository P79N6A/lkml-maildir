Umm, why do these faults happen at all?  When all the hugetlb code went
in it we allocated at mmap time.  Later it was converted to demand faulting
but under the premise that we keep the strict overcommit accounting.  When
did that part go away aswell?  With strict overcommit handling for huge
pages no fault should happen when the pool is exausted.
