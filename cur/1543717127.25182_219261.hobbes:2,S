That worked.  The interrupts got redistributed like so:
  6:        172          XT-PIC  Intel 82801DB-ICH4, yenta
  7:       3014          XT-PIC  uhci_hcd, yenta, ndiswrapper
  8:          4          XT-PIC  rtc
  9:        188          XT-PIC  acpi
 12:       1028          XT-PIC  i8042

It piles the sound and cardbus onto IRQ 5, along with a USB that I'm
actually using.  For some reason it doesn't touch IRQ 6.  Here are dmesg
and /proc/interrupts from 2.6.1, 2.6.6 w/ acpi_irq_isa=12, and 2.6.6 w/
your patch:

That also worked and produced the same IRQ mapping as acpi_irq_isa=12.
Thanks!  If you want any more logs, etc, let me know.
