Hi Linus,
I've seen 3 user land lockups with test10pre4 so far on my UP K6-400, running
it for a day.  test9 which ran before for more than a week
was rock stable. They all happened during some IO load (e.g. a gcc compile
or a loop mke2fs), usually with some CPU eaters running in the background.
I unfortunately did not catch any logs, because all crashes happened with
X active. The machine did usually still answer to ping, but the userland
seemed to be dead (ssh not answering). In the first case I managed to log in
but it locked during a ps ax.
The machine has an ALI IDE chipset with IDE disks.
