Hi!
In linux-2.6.11/include/linux/limits.h , I see :
#define NAME_MAX         255    /* # chars in a file name */
#define PATH_MAX        4096    /* # chars in a path name including nul */
Is it really "chars" or actually "bytes" ?
AFAIK, the kernel does not care about the meaning of the data,
so it does not (need to) know how many chars it represents.
BTW, isn't 4096 a bit low ? WiXXXXX supports 32000 ;-)
(OK, it isn't low, but some apps and/or APIs enforce a lower
limit, like 1024, right ?)
Best regards,
David Balazic
