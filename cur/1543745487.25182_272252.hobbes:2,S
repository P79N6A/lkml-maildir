Hello Rusty,
The broken part I encountered is from the latest module-init-tools 3.1. Is that possible to restore the allowable parameter length as it for 2.4.x, at least increase it from 1K to 4K?
Regards,
Eddie

Well, the quote handling in insmod was ripped out after 3.0, exactly
because it was broken like this.  But modprobe will use the latter form,
since it will paste it straight from the modprobe.conf file (which needs
quotes in options lines).
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
PS. module-init-tools 3.1 just out...
