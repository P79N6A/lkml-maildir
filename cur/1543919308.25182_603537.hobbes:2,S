Sam mipslet 'parisc-linux' in the first mail ... so i replied to the
second mail ... without checking l-k was still cc'd.

He doesn't have a compiler installed that can target parisc.  It doesn't
seem obvious to me that this should work.

OK.

OK, killed.  I don't think anyone still uses that.

Actually, this looks utterly unstandardised:
arch/cris/Makefile:LIBGCC = $(shell $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -print-file-name=libgcc.a)
arch/h8300/Makefile:LIBGCC := $(shell $(CROSS-COMPILE)$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -print-libgcc-file-name)
arch/m32r/Makefile:LIBGCC       := $(shell $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -print-libgcc-file-name)
arch/parisc/Makefile:libs-y     += arch/parisc/lib/ `$(CC) -print-libgcc-file-name`
arch/sh64/Makefile:LIBGCC := $(shell $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -print-libgcc-file-name)
arch/sh/Makefile:LIBGCC := $(shell $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -print-libgcc-file-name)
arch/xtensa/Makefile:LIBGCC := $(shell $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -print-libgcc-file-name)
How about we set it in the main Makefile, or one of the ones in
scripts/?  That way we don't have to learn why $(shell $(CC) $(CFLAGS)
-print-libgcc-file-name) is superior to `$(CC) -print-libgcc-file-name`

Huh.  Looks like the sense of the test is reversed too.  That should
probably be:
	@if [ ! -x $(PALO) ]; then \

One issue is that we don't have native 64-bit userspace on parisc.
And we don't have a toolchain that you can pass -m32/-m64 to; you have
to explicitly build a hppa64-linux-gnu toolchain.  Another thing we try
and make user-friendly is that if you're building the parisc kernel on
a non-parisc machine, you need to use a cross-compiler, so we autodetect
that case for you.
