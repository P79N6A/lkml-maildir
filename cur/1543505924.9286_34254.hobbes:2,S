Count me as one more voice for having readl_ns etc...
I added this for PCMCIA a long time ago because it was the most concise
way to handle the big/little-endian issue for my drivers.  Defining
big-endian variants for read*/write* calls clearly provides equivalent
functionality, of course... so it is just a syntax issue...
> #ifdef BIG_ENDIAN
>  #define gfx_readl(x)    bigendian_readl(x)
>  #define gfx_writel(x,y) bigendian_writel(x,y)
> #else
>  #define gfx_readl(x)    readl(x)
>  #define gfx_writel(x,y) writel(x,y)
> #endif
So you're saying that the driver actually wants *_ns calls (since
that's what you're #defining here).  If the main use of bigendian_*
calls is to create macros for the *_ns calls that drivers need, why
not just give them these calls in the first place?
