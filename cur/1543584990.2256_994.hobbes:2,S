Yesterday I discovered that the load I can throw out to network seems to
depend on other activities running on machine. I was able to get
throughput of 33M/s with ATM when machine was idle, while I compiled
kernel at same time, the throughput was 135M/s.
So, I suggest you try to compile kernel while running your UDP stream!
