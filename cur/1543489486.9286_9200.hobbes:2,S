Hi,
   I was trying to run 2.2.3 (same problem with all 2.[12].* kernel I tried)
on an old 386SX machine with an ISA memory extention board inside
(4MB in SIMMs + 3.5 MB on the memory board) and received a series of:
> NMI: IOCK error (debug interrupt?)
...
> Process init (pid 1, process number 1, stackpage=c0003000)
...
> NMI: IOCK error (debug interrupt?)
...
> Process init (pid 1, process number 1, stackpage=c0003000)
...
etc. (system is dead, of course)
just after (or even during) starting init. No matter what the init process
is, init=/bin/bash give same result. Works fine with mem=4m, so the problem
must be related with the memory extention board. 
I can restore (manually - don't have serial console) all data but I'm not
sure if they would be usefull...
The machine works stable with 2.0.3* kernels, however a mesage:
> Uhhuh. NMI received. Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
> You probably have a hardware problem with your RAM chips or a
> power saving mode enabled.
appeared during boot (while starting INIT).
Is there any chance to get it working with 2.2 or do I have broken 
hardware ?
I don't know if it is related, but this machine often has problem with 
rebooting (hangs before reboot, or after reboot BIOS reports all possible 
BIOS-detectable errors)
Regards
    Andrzej
