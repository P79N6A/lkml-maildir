And how about people who, for some reason, don't want the modules 
installed?
Sure, you can just copy the files you want by hand, which is what I do 
personally, but I find it nice that installing the kernel image and 
modules are two sepperate steps. If a user wants both done automagically, 
then that user could just create a 2 line shell script.
Or how about leaving "make install" and "make modules_install" as is and 
add a new target, say, "make install_all" or similar?
