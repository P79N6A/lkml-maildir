It certainly would be nice to have that.  Not nessesarely in the
kernel through, people tend not to like such complex stuff like cpu
emulation in the kernel for good reasons.  The kernel can run
userspace apps (modprobe, hotplug), that mechanism could be used to
invoke a userspace tool which does the boot / mode switching.  Having
it in userspace likely also makes it easier to share code with X11.
Have you talked to the powermanagement guys btw.?  One of the major
issues with suspend-to-ram is to get the graphics card back online,
and SNAPBoot might help to fix this too.  I'm not sure a userspace
solution would work for *that* through.
