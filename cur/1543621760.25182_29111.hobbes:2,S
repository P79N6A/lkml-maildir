Apart from not really liking this approach, you've made the strtry()
function inlined. Any saving you might make with removing code from
the callers is probably more than lost due to all the extra inlined
code.
Did you compare the sizes of the stripped binary to see what the
effect of your patch is?

But you've inserted calls to strrchr in cases where it's not really
needed.
BTW: linux-kernel isn't the right place to discuss devfsd
development. The right place is devfs@oss.sgi.com (I've set Reply-To:
to do this).
