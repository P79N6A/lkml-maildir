Just out of curiosity what architecture are you using, is it one that 
doesn't support PnP BIOS?
Here they are:
/driverfs/device/pnp
/driverfs/device/pnp/01
/driverfs/device/pnp/02
/driverfs/device/pnp/03
etc.
/driverfs/bus/pnp
/driverfs/bus/pnp/devices
etc.
/driverfs/bus/pnp/drivers
etc.

alloc_pnpbios_root is now static.  I'm going to leave bus_type as it is 
because I want it open to other files at least for now.

Thanks for pointing it out, fixed it.

The pnpbios driver will not compile without these changes, it was broken 
a few versions back.  I also made some improvements to insert_device.

I did some serious restructuring here and in pnpbios_device_probe.  Also 
I made it a bit more like the one used by pci.  Hopefully it's all right 
now.

pnpbios_device_probe now returns a negative number on failure.  I'm 
creating a more flexible pnpbios specific device data structure that can 
be used instead of pci_dev in my next patch.  I should be able to clean 
some of this up once I do that.  I'll take care of the device specific 
info then.

Yep, I'm getting a new isp and email address soon, then I'll be able to 
use Mutt instead of Mozzila.  It turns out netscape mail doesn't really 
use imap like it appeared to, so it's incompatible.  For now this is the 
only safe way I can send patches.

Thank you for reviewing my patch.  I appreciate it.  If there are any 
other issues please let me know.
thanks,
