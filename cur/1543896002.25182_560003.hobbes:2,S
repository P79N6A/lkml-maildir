Hi,
first of all I'm happy to see that people are still working on unionfs;
I'd love to have functionality like this show up in Linux.
I'll not claim to have any VFS knowledge whatsoever, but I was just
wondering what happens in the following scenario:
FS A is mounted twice, in /mnt/A and /mnt/union
FS B is mounted twice, in /mnt/B and as topmost union mount
on /mnt/union
lets for simplicity say both filesystems are entirely empty
user does on FS A: 
mkdir  /mnt/A/somedir
touch /mnt/A/somedir/somefile
and then 2 things happen in parallel
1) touch /mnt/B/somefile
2) mv /mnt/union/somedir /mnt/union/somefile
since the underlying FS for 2) is FS A... how will this work out locking
wise? Will the VS lock the union directory only? Or will this operate
only on the underlying FS? How is dcache consistency guaranteed for
scenarios like this?
Greetings,
