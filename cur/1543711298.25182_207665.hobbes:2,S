Subject: [2/3] Use insert_resource in pci_claim_resource

On ia64, the parent resources are not necessarily PCI resources and
so won't get found by pci_find_parent_resource.  Use the shiny new
insert_resource() function instead, which I think we would have used
here had it been available at the time.

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
