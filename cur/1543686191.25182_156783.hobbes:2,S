Well if thats what you intend, yes. Or set poll to be non-blocking.

This is the CPU scheduler though. A program could be a disk/network
hog and use a few % cpu. Its obviously not a cpu hog, and should get
the cpu again soon after it is woken. Sooner than non running cpu hogs,
anyway.

Yeah, I know Con is trying to detect this. Its just that detecting
it using TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE/TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE may not be the best
way. Suddenly your kernel compile on an NFS mount becomes interactive
for example. Then again, the way things are, Con might not have any
other option.
Mostly I agree with what you've said above.
