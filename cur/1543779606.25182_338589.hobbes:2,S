I think you'd have to follow the "transparent" case down.. And even then 
you'd have the half-transparent case to worry about it.
So I think it would be much easier to just make the change in
"pci_bus_alloc_resource()", and say that if the parent resource that we're
testing starts at some non-zero value, we just use that instead of "min"  
when we call down to allocate_resource(). That gets it for MEM resources 
too.
Something like the following (also _totally_ untested, but even simpler 
than yours). It basically says: if the parent resource starts at non-zero, 
we use that as the starting point for allocations, otherwise the passed-in 
value.
That, together with changing PCIBIOS_MIN_IO to 0x2000 (or even 0x4000)  
might be the ticket...
