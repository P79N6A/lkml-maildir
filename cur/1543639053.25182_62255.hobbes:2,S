If you see the pci code as a bus device driver, it becomes a problem. I
looked at the remaining initcalls in my kernel and most of them are for
pci. I think pci is rather abusing the initcall system.
I have that idea that pci (like other buses) could become a "normal"
driver module (one will probably never compile it as a module, but one
could at least manage it like one).
So if we integrate the bus initalizations into the device initializations,
there isn't much left of the current initcalls.

I agree that it's currently a mess, maybe your solution is the better in
the short term to make the dependencies explicit, I'm not sure about that.
My idea is to handle as much as possible over the module/driver
initialization mechanisms and leave initcalls as special cases.
