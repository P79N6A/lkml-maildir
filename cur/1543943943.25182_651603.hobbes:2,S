Just for the record, Hungarian notation would have it like:
  ulTrueEnd
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation
And the kernel doesn't do that, to wit (from Documentation/CodingStyle):
 Linus Torvalds (against systems Hungarian): Encoding the type of a
function into the name (so-called Hungarian notation) is brain damaged -
the compiler knows the types anyway and can check those, and it only
confuses the programmer.
