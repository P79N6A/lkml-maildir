Using a block cipher as a hash algorithm isn't nessesarily more secure.  The
"less moving parts" argument is quickly pushed aside by the "round peg in a
round hole" argument.
SHA-1/SHA-256/384/512 were *designed* to be message digests.  AES was not (as
a requirement anyways).
I have a CTR mode patch ready for crypto/cipher.c.  I would like to implement
OMAC (the 6th AES approved mode of opereation) before giving the patch, but
you can't use OMAC the way you use ECB/CBC/CTR mode.
The analogy of:
for (i=0; i<len; i++)
  omac_encrypt(tfm, dst[i], src[i], nbytes);
Will not work with OMAC since it creates a MAC and not a ciphertext stream
like the other modes.
for (i=0; i<len; i++)
  omac_encrypt(tfm, dst[0], src[i], nbytes);
/*                      ^ see here!           */
memcpy(mac, dest, ...); /* store the mac */
Is more appropriate.  James - is this possible?

Oooh, Jari.
