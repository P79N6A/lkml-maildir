I have a habit of copying .config to /etc, and if I jump to another tree,
I just "cp /etc/.config ." and do a "make oldconfig" since my kernel options
don't change that much. /etc was chosen by me but just about any directory
will do.
My big box compiles all the kernels for my small boxes so I do a (on each
one individually, not duplicating all config files on all machines):
'cp .config /etc/.config.tristessa',
'cp .config /etc/.config.lucretia',
'cp .config /etc/.config.multiameal',
'cp .config /etc/.config.glynis',
'cp .config /etc/.config.magnolia'
Works well with each compiling over nfs.
