Nope. 
What works:
1) _Both_ joysticks (one that uses the analog driver, the other that uses the 
sidewinder driver) work fine under Win2k.
2) Sound works under both Linux and Win2k.
3) The analog joystick (I didn't have the sidewinder yet) use to work at some 
point in the past on this system with a 2.6 kernel.
What doesn't work:
1) Either the analog or sidewinder joysticks using any kernel I've tested so 
far, loading snd_ens1371 using either joystick=1 or joystick_port=1 (I test 
both out of habit). (Loaded in the order of snd_ens1371 (which loads 
gameport), joydev, and then analog or sidewinder. Putting joydev or gameport 
or both before snd_ens1371 doesn't improve the situation.)
