There is a fundamental misunderstanding here: GFP_DMA allocations have 
nothing to do with DMA. Rather GFP_DMA means allocate memory in a special 
range of physical memory that is required by legacy devices that cannot 
use the high address bits for one or the other reason. Any regular 
memory can be used for DMA.
Could you refactor the patch a bit? This is quite a big patch.
