   The issue is that you really want to do prefetching in these loops
   (waiting for the hardware prefetch is too slow because it needs several
   cache misses to trigger) so for cache hints on reading only prefetch
   instructions are interesting.
   
I'm talking about using this to bypass the cache on the stores.
The prefetches are a seperate issue and I agree with you on that.
