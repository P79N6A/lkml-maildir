It's a fortigate 60.  We put our secure web servers behind a netscreen 5 
firewall which plugs into the fortigate and that's when the problems 
started.  I remember reading some stuff on lkm about recent tcp changes 
but I couldn't remember exactly what it was. Thanks for reminding me !
Here is how it's layed out now
secure_web_servers->netscreen->fortigate->rest_of_network
Thanks !
