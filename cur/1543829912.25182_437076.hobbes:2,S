The problem is that if you start at the routes you have to do things
at layer 3 and you can't do anything at layer 2.  (i.e. You can't use DHCP).
You loose a whole lot of flexibility and power when you make it a
layer 3 only mechanism.

The problem is that you have to add a lot of new logic which is very
hard to get right and has some really weird corner cases that are very
hard to understand.  
- That makes the patches hard to review.  
- It makes it hard for the implementors to get it right.
- It means that there will be corner cases that the users don't
  understand.
- It is less flexible/powerful in what you can express?
I've been down that route it sucks.  Anything more than the simple
filter at bind time is asking for real trouble until you do the whole
thing.
