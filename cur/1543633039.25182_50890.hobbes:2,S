GFP_KERKEL is OK on the readpages() path, but on the writepages()
path it can go infinitely recursive - it needs to be GFP_NOFS.
So another arg is needed here.  I suspect this function ends up adding
more complexity than it takes away, frankly.

Here we're allocating a new BIO before submitting the old one.
This increases the risk of oom deadlocks on the vm_writeback()
path.
I'd prefer that the bio alloc/submit code paths be left as-is...

I believe it's cleaner to allow get_block() to decide which
blockdevice belongs to this mapping, really.
