v2.0.6? There's quite some differences between v2.0.6 and v2.0.38... I'm
not really sure that those patches would port cleanly.

Hmmm. My first response would be not to use a close-source proprietary
program such as RealAudio, but I guess that's not the answer you want...
Is there really no v2.2 version of RA?
I won't spend time porting the es137[01]-driver myself, as I haven't got
such a card, but as a sound-driver is totally separated from the rest of
the system, it won't affect users who doesn't compile that driver into the
kernel. Thus I will at least consider adding the driver if you send
me a patch that applies cleanly onto v2.0.38, that has been tested
*thoroughly*.
