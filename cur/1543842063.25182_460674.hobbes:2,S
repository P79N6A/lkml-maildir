please re-read my email and the initial thread about MODULE_FIRMWARE.
The MODULE_FIRMWARE extension only export the pattern used by
request_firmware(), because otherwise some tools don't know what a
kernel driver actually expects.
It happens to be a 1:1 mapping, but that is pure coincidence and a
little bit of laziness from the early users (mainly me) when providing
the first firmware script for the hotplug package. For all my drivers, I
don't need any fancy mapping.

No. We need to make the actual file for loading the firmware appear
under the device in sysfs. So the userspace can read extra information
from the driver or device and then make its decision on which firmware
to load.

I say, leave this up to the driver. For a couple of drivers this works
perfectly fine and I don't see any need to change my drivers and make
them more complex if it is not needed.
>From my point I don't see any advantage to make firmware loading more
complex from the kernel perspective. All this weird stuff needs to be
done in userspace. Our current way works quite good for a number devices
that need binary firmware.
I think it is better to first collect the needs of the driver authors
and make sure they understand their own needs. This is not always true.
And then we can discuss any extensions to change something. And I prefer
to have actual hardware and their drivers as an example.
The MODULE_FIRMWARE() extension is an easy and simple extension that
goes along with the current idea of request_firmware().
