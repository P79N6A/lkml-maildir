This was not meant to say that I have not read your patch. Of course, I
have read it and already commented that you seem to be suggesting a new
policy for reserved file allocation, namely to allow touching the slab
cache for the sake of satisfying the root'd allocation requests. This,
imho, is unnecessary because the current design of
get_empty_filp() makes use of the freelist for this purpose -- there is no
need to extend or drop this constraint -- the simple check if freelist has
elements still, is quite sufficient.
