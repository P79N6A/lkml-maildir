Sorry for the late reply. I was away from Email for the whole week.
Scsi host numbers (for both regstered and unregistered hosts)
are preserved in scsi_host_no_list.
The list is used in the function scsi_register (in drivers/scsi/hosts.c).
Same function also adds new hosts to the list.
The list can be initialized (from boot parameters ?) by 
the function scsi_host_no_init (drivers/scsi/scsi.c).
