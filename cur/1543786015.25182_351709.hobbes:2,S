That's pretty bold, coming from someone who cannot even figure out how
to follow the style guidelines of the kernel.
The elevator core api is so trivial, I don't believe you find this hard
to read. The individual io schedulers tend to have comments in functions
that aren't immediately obvious. So I'm curious, what do part makes you
go 'ugh'?
So please explain or refrain from making stupid unwarranted comments
about other peoples code.

Then why do you insist on commenting your code differently than everyone
else ('everyone' means the kernel here, since that is your target)?
