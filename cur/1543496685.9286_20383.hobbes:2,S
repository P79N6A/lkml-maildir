I'm currently working with a Panasonic LF-D101 DVD-RAM device. It
works well, apart from the following two issues:
1.) You have to patch Linux to have it recognize the LF-D101 as
    optical (writeable) device. In short, all you do is to add
    another device to the SCSI device blacklist, and put some
    magic around it.
2.) You need a kernel with 2048 Byte blocksize support. I'm using
    Linux-2.2.9. I couldn't get partition-table support to work
    yet, though (so I'm using the whole /dev/sda device). Anyone
    with experience in 2k blocksize & partition tables out there?
I can send you my patch if you are interested (but it's floating
around in mailing-lists in one or another version anyway)
I'll try to fix it all up and to present a reasonable clean solution
to be integrated into the kernel in the near future. Stay tuned!
The LF-D101 seems to be a cool device. It works reasonable fast, and
the media are really _cheap_ (you get 1GB of direct accessible,
removable storage capacity for about EUR 7,- excluding taxes!)
