I recommend resubmitting this question to a mailing list that actually 
focuses on this topic:
video4linux-list@redhat.com
However, I highly recommend that you subscribe before you post, as the 
redhat server adds a REPLY-TO header to the video4linux list emails, and 
has been known to drop cc's:
http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list
See you there!
