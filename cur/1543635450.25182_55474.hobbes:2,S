Hello Linux experts,
I don`t know i a came to the right place.
I need a little help. On my router i have 2 ethernet cards Realtek 
8029/bnc+utp.
I read the documentation found on 
http://www.scyld.com/network/ne2k-pci.html
 and according to this i 
configured:
cat /etc/modules.conf
alias eth0 ne2k-pci
options ne2k-pci full_duplex=1
alias eth1 ne2k-pci
options ne2k-pci full_duplex=1
The problem is that i don`t know with this settings my ethenets works in 
full duplex mode. How can i check?
I compilled and executed as root: ./net2k-pci-diag -a and i saw that 
booth cards are still in half-duplex!
Are my settings correct or no. If no, what else i can do.
Any suggestion will be appreciatted.
Mihai
