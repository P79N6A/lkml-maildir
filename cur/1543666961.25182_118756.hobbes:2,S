Hi Andrew,
No I haven't, so I will try this.
I have downloaded the scsirastools and get the following mode page dump:
Device [3] is ready for modepage
Starting modepage process for 1 disk.
Getting mode sense pages from disk 3
Block Descriptor & Mode Pages:
04 45 dc cc 00 00 02 00    :Block Descriptor
01 0a c0 0b ff 00 00 00 05 00 ff ff
02 0e 80 80 00 0a 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

00 06 00 00 0f 00 00 00
I'm not up on SCSI mode pages, do I just have to change the "line"
1c 0a 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01
to
1c 0a 88 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01
??
Cheers
