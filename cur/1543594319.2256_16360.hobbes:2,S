There are places in the world where a i486sx is viewed with awe... and i386
are commonplace. Don't fall into the trap of "All Linux PCs are in the US".
Besides, if the piece of junk does its job well, why buy an expensive,
completely overqualified new machine for it? Sure would make PC makers
happy, but I'm not _that_ interested in their happiness to tell the truth.

... and a nightmare where nobody knows the state of <favorite driver> in
<targeted kernel tree> and has to cross-port all kind of stuff to get
<random machine> to work.

Bingo!
