No it's not.
What I'm asking for is a simple
	if (vma->vm_flags & VM_READ)
		make_pages_readable();
kind of thing. A couple of one-liners in the _callers_, not a horribly 
ugly change way down the stack.
Flags are ugly. Multi-value flags that have magic constants are worse. 
This patch deserves to die.
