Subject: [PATCH 09/25] make access() use mnt check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/20/365

It is OK to let access() go without using a mnt_want/drop_write()
pair because it doesn't actually do writes to the filesystem,
and it is inherently racy anyway.  This is a rare case when it is
OK to use __mnt_is_readonly() directly.
