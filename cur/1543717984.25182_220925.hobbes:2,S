Hm, 13.16.3 in my version, but indeed: all logical processors should
be put asleep in the same way ;)

Probably true for some motherboards, but Asus got a WinXP program
called 'AiBooster' which is a program to under/overclock from -50% to
+33% runtime (butt-ugly UI can be seen in
http://www.asuscom.de/pub/ASUS/mb/sock478/p4p800/AIBooster_u.pdf
). Could
Wine be used (given the right permissions) to run or disect such a
utility to make underclocking reality under Linux?
*hopeful* Or has Asus released the specification of its motherboard?
