I'd say "neither", because both
    signed void *ptr; and
    unsigned void *xyz;
are impossible (and dull at that). That's why you explicitly will
have to cast one operand in a comparison to make it evident
what sort of comparison is intended, i.e.
    if((unsigned long)ptr < PAGE_OFFSET)
Further, giving again answer to the question whether they generate signed or
unsigned comparisons: Have you ever seen a computer which addresses memory with
negative numbers? Since the answer is most likely no, signed comparisons would
not make sense for me.
