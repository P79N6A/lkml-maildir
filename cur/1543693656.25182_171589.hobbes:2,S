It can lead to funny quirks when doing df: Used + Available != Total
Granted the effects won't be enormous (typically you'll see between 1
and 63 blocks off in the case of NFS w/ 32kwsize and 512byte frsize)
but people get upset about this. That was the reason for adding an
f_frsize field in the first place...
Note: one solution might be to swap the positions of f_frsize and
f_bsize in the kernel struct that is passed up to userland. I.e. pass
up
 struct statfs {
         __u32 f_type;
-         __u32 f_bsize;
+         __u32 f_frsize;
         __u32 f_blocks;
         __u32 f_bfree;
         __u32 f_bavail;
         __u32 f_files;
         __u32 f_ffree;
         __kernel_fsid_t f_fsid;
         __u32 f_namelen;
-         __u32 f_frsize;
+         __u32 f_bsize;
         __u32 f_spare[5];
 };
That will give correct values for the f_bfree, f_bavail,... in the
legacy statfs() case for all existing filesystems.
glibc's statvfs() can then do the correct thing if it detects a >=2.6.0
kernel. It needs to do a copy to its private statvfs struct anyway.
Cheers,
