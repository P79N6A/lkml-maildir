Yes, but the definition of the LINK hasn't been specified yet -
something like the command
	(cd /lib/modules; ln -s 2.2.14 boot)
would do, but that defines the link. The path to the appropriate modules
is would be /lib/modules/boot/module_name. It would appear to simplify
the loader a bit by not requiring it to retrieve the uname -r (or uname
-m, or ...) and add flexibility to it as well since the actual link
might be created by:
	(cd /lib/modules; ln -s `uname -m`/`uname -r` boot)
That would allow for variations in the directory structure while maintaining
compatiblility for all module loaders/build procedures that would need it.
