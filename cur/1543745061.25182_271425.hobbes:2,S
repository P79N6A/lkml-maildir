With these patches and a new test where I periodically put on mild
but diminishing memory pressure, I have been able to get the number
of inodes up to 31 Million.  I would really like to find a way to
reduce limit the number of inodes or am I seeing a problem where
none exists?  After putting on constant mild memory pressure, I have
seen then number of inodes stabilize at 17-18 Million.
