Yes, the user sees a string of characters, but the octet 0x2f ('/') and 
the terminating NUL character '\0' are still perfectly normal characters 
and there is no confusion.
The reason: UTF-8. It's the only sane encoding (apart from a pure extended
ASCII setup, which is also sane, but is obviously unacceptable for a large
portion of the world).
If some misguided person has told you about UCS-2 and horrors like UTF-9,
just ignore them. They are crazy and deluded, and - perhaps more
importantly - stupid.
In short: the kernel talks bytestreams, and that implies that if you want 
to talk to the kernel, you HAVE TO USE UTF-8.
At which point there are no locale issues any more. The only locale issue 
you can have is user space mistaking a stream of bytes as extended ASCII, 
which will cause all your pretty UTF-8 characters to be shown as strange 
latin1 (or other) squiggles.

People understand the problem. And UTF-8 is the solution.
It's getting there. I think even Microsoft has seen the light, and is
phasing out their crapola (UCS-2LE? Whatever).

No. Things like "iocharset" are not the solution. They are literally the
_problem_. The solution is to use something that not only acts as ASCII,
but also has a wide enough range to cover the whole required space (UCS-2
fails _both_ of these fundamental tests). At which point "iocharset" makes 
no sense any more, and only exists as a way to translate legacy crap into 
the one true format.
And that one true format is UTF-8. End of story. If you try to talk to the 
kernel in UCS-2 or anything else, you _will_ fail.
