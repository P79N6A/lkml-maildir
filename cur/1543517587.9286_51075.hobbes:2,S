Hi,
I have a small query regarding passing of user data into kernel mode. I 
have an inplementation in the kernel which requires user data. AFAIK, the 
three methods are system calls, ioctls and setsockopts. Am I correct in 
this regard and are there any other ways to do this job. Also, please tell 
me which is the most efficient method to do the same. Any links will be 
great.
And after receiving user data is it sufficient if I just call "verify_area" 
.
TIA and rgds,
Vinu
