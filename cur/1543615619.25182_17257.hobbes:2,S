Only place I've seen that (not sure it was true SCSI though) was on a
Cray file server - each target (4) was itself a raid 5, with 5 transports.
That would be total of 20 disks. The four targets were striped together in
software to form a single filesystem. I think that was our first over 300GB
filesystem (several years ago). Now we are using 1 TB to 5TB filesystems
with nearly 5 million files each.
