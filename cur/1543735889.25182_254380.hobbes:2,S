OK. Bad things seem to happen with this patch. Each time I booted it 
(twice) several telnet connections get dropped before I get a prompt 
(this is without any load on the system). The system SEEMED a bit less 
responsive. I can't be sure about that because I booted it remotely. 
After starting stress-kernel and logging out, I couldn't get back into 
the system remotely. Telnet and ssh both would just hang indefinitely. 
The console was still useable I think (according to my wife being my 
remote hands and eyes.) I saw no indications in the log of any 
unhappiness or any indications of why connections were dropping and 
hanging. Also the highest latency reported was 252 usec.
