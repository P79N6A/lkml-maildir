This found its way into 2.4 on 13 Mar 2002, with the comment
"Revert tulip changes which were apparently causing slowdowns"
by some guy called Jeff Garzik.
It was part of a larger cset. The other part touched tulip_core.c
in a part that no longer seems to be there in 2.5 (See the
DC21041 part of tulip_up in 2.4).
