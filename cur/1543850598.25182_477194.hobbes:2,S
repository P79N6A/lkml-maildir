Subject: [RFC] kswapd: Kernel Swapper performance

One thing that has improved in 2.6, wrt 2.4, is swapper performance.  And the 
difference isn't small either: ~5 fold increase in swapin performance.
But swapin performance still lags swapout performance by 50%, which is a bit 
odd, considering swapin to be a read from disk, usually faster, and swapout 
to be a write to disk, usually slower.
Now, this slowdown could be explained by additional seek action, caused by 
different apps paging-in at different times with different locations on 
swap.
Yet, even a single app paging-out consecutive pages, and paging-in the same 
pages in one go, exhibits this upside-down swapout/swapin performance ratio.
Improving this ratio could possibly yield a dramatic improvement in system 
performance under memory load (think tmpfs/swsusp/...).
Thanks!
