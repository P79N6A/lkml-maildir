It can also be enabled/disabled at runtime, Documentation/sysrq.txt says
that the default now is on (but that it used to default to off). Perhaps
it is getting turned off somewhere in your boot scripts etc. 
You can check with
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq

Documentation/sysrq.txt also says:
*  How do I use the magic SysRq key?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On x86   - You press the key combo 'ALT-SysRq-<command key>'. Note - Some
           keyboards may not have a key labeled 'SysRq'. The 'SysRq' key is
           also known as the 'Print Screen' key. Also some keyboards cannot
           handle so many keys being pressed at the same time, so you might
           have better luck with "press Alt", "press SysRq", "release Alt",
           "press <command key>", release everything.
Perhaps your keyboard is one of those that can't cope with all those
keys?
Ian.
