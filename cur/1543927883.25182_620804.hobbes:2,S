In this case, getting sensors installed is the opposite of what you want to do.
The idea is to simplify the system until it works, then figure out what
simplification made it work.
ie. disable sensors entirely by building a kernel with CONFIG_HWMON=n
If that makes things work, then it is a clue.
If that was disabled already, then just keep it disabled.
