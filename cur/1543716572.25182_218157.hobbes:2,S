Even if thread creation normally never fails, we still check for its
return code and have some error recovery code! In that case, 
I dont understand the point behind continuing the loop once thread
destruction fails for some CPU. Lets say on a 128 CPU machine, if
thread creation fails for the 1st CPU (because of say ENOMEM?), then
why continue trying to create threads for the rest of 126 CPUs and
_then_ destroy? Why not just break at the first occurence of failure 
and cleanup then and there?
