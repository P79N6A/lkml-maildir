This is what you are doing anyway. You seem to slander Linux whenever you
get the chance. (Do I need to mention the forum at www.heise.de?)
OTOH you are even distributing *binary patches* for the all-perfect
Solaris in the cdrecord distribution. And while you talk about writing
free software, you encourage people to use an operating system (Solaris)
whose license prohibits the publication of benchmark results and user
experiences.
