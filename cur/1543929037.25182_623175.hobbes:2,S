Crap, I forgot to add the sign-off, so here it goes again:

Subject: HWMON: coretemp, suspend fix
 
It's not permitted to unregister a device after devices have been suspended.
It causes deadlocks to appear on systems with coretemp hwmon loaded.  To avoid
this, we can make coretemp_cpu_callback() do nothing if the _FROZEN bit is set
in action.
 
Also, in other cases it's generally to late to unregister the coretemp device
if the CPU is already dead, so it should be unregistered on CPU_DOWN_PREPARE.
