Actually it originally there to support a backport of that version
to the 2.4 kernel, which has periodically worked.  That was the
downside of that particular patch of yours ... it didn't wrap the
dev_* calls as ohci_* calls, so the backport effort went up.
But OK, I'll remove that for now and resend.
