I don't get it. If the adapter is isolated, there is no way the i2c-core
will probe it anyway. As Adrian Cox underlined, it should be far easier
and more efficient to separate these adapters from the main i2c adapters
list from the beginning than leaving them in the main list and then try
and prevent future probings using a flag.
Also, how does this proposal interact with the work on the i2c classes?
Although the classes carry more information than a simple flag or a
complete separation, both were/may be introduced to achieve the same
goal, isn't it?
Thanks,
