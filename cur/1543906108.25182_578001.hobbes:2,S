Tweaking kernel ptes is prohibitive during clone() because that's
kernel memory and it would require a flush tlb all with IPIs that
won't scale (IPIs are really the blocker). Basically vmalloc already
does what you suggest with the gap page and yet we can't use it for
performance reasons. Kernel stack should be readable by any context to
allow sysrq+t kind of things, so I doubt it's feasible to do tricks to
avoid ipis.
