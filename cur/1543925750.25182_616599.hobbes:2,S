Right now, one of the limitations of the CPU controller is that
the moment you create another control group, the bandwidth gets
divided by the default number of shares. We can't create groups
just for monitoring. cpu_acct fills this gap. I think in the
long run, we should move the helper functions into cpu_acct.c
and the interface logic into kernel/sched.c (cpu controller).
