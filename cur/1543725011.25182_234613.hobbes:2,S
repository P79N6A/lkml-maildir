The naming is bad, I agree. But as Dipankar pointed out earlier, there
was no kref when I did this.  We (Dipankar and myslef) had a discussion
and decided:
1. I will make a patch to shrink kref and feed it to Greg
2. Add new set kref api for lockfree refcounting --
	kref_lf_xxx.  (kref_lf_get, kref_lf_get_rcu etc.,)
3. Change the fd lookup patch to use kref_lf_xxx api
Does that sound ok?
Thanks,
Kiran
