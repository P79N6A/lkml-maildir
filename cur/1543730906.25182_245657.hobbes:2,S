In traditional UNIX filesystems, copy loses some info too
(owner,group,mode bits). cp and tar was taught about this
and they now can preserve that info.
However, I do not think that hacking on cp, tar, etc everytime
we need to add something to our filesystems (xattrs, ACLs,
whatever) is a terribly attractive idea.
I think reiserfs is going to handle that by giving uniform access
to such ancillary data. It will be visible as file/meta/*
filelets ('small files') or something like that and can be saved/restored
by e.g. tar *without* needing to know what data is stored there, and
in what format.
I think Hans is not planning turning old "file is a stream of bytes"
into eight-stream octopus. One stream will remain as a 'main' one,
which contains actual data. Others will keep metadata, etc...
Note that even today's files aren't simple "streams of bytes"
because they also have names,mode bits etc.
