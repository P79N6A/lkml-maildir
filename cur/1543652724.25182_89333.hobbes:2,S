Hello!
Is there any way to activate again secondary IDE channel from kernel (or
user space), if I has disabled it from bios?
My problem is that:
The bios won't boot at all if I have over 32G hard disk connected, but if
I disabled secondary IDE channel, it will.
So is it possible to re-activate this IDE channel, and if it is possible,
how this should be done and would this cause any trouble afterward?
At the moment my kernel version is 2.4.20-rc1.
My IDE controller is:
00:01.1 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01)
(prog-if 80 [Master])
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32
        I/O ports at e000 [size=16]
Any advices are highly appreciate,
Jani
