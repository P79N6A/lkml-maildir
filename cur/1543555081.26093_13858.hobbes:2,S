Thanks. I tried to do "by hand" the inlining (just cut and paste, the proc
seemed
not to be used anywhere but time.c), but the result was the same. So looked at
the
gcc info and saw that the function was being inlined from opt level 3.
Also realized that the 'O4' level does not exist in gcc ( I think i 'ported' it
from
use of IRIX cc), so just O2 is right.
Anyway, you can compile somehing with -O9751, and gcc says nothing. If max opt
level
is 3, any higher level should trig a warning at least...
