Strange.  What does your msr 0x482 look like?  If you have 
/dev/cpu/0/msr, the following will spit it out:
-------------
#!/usr/bin/python
import struct
msrs = file('/dev/cpu/0/msr')
msrs.seek(0x482)
msr = msrs.read(8)
msr = struct.unpack('Q', msr)[0]
print '%x' % (msr,)
----------------
(that msr can force trapping of the pause instruction, even though 
there's no good reason to do it, and kvm wouldn't inject a gp if it did 
anyway).
