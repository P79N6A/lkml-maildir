kexec 1.101 released 15 February 2005

Yes and no.
I just booted 2.6.24 on a diskless system (Mandriva) I normally use with 
2.6.18 kernel, did kexec -e... And it executed the kernel immediately, 
without any syncing.
On Debian, with the same 2.6.24 kernel, it does sync.
So what user space part does the syncing (and how to prevent it)?

It does seem to help, thanks.
Why it has to be the last option specified?
I tried -f option before (don't call shutdown), but it didn't help.

Good to have a newer version, I'll try that, too.
