So you're worried about our code?  OK, if you look, you'll see we only
have to flush one address in the mmap_shared list, (which is usually the
long list).
I'd constructed it on the predicate that flushing a non-current space is
more expensive than finding a current one, but I can alter it to flush
the first vma it comes to with a present translation.
The mmap list is usually empty.  We only excite that case for multiple
private mappings of a file which for some reason gets updated.
I'd be very surprised if flush_dcache_page executes more than a few
hundred instructions all told...that's certainly nowhere close to a
timeslice.
