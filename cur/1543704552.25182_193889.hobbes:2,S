airo.ko does not support this Airo device, but with the addition of this 
patch it recognizes the device.

I am guessing that the *'s rather than hex characters displayed are 
because it is unable to read the key from the card.  The card itself 
appears to be completely inoperative.  It was suggested to me to try 
both "open" and "restricted" mode, both seem to not help the situation.
Any suggestions?
