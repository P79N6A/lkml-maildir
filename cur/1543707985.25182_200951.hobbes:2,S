This is the incremental min logic doing its work though. Maybe
that should be fixed up to be less aggressive instead of putting
more complexity in the scanner to work around it.
Anyway could you post the patch you're using to fix it?

The logical extension of that is: "we want to reclaim *lowmem* in
response to highmem reclaim pressure because any ..."
If this isn't what the scanner is doing then it should be fixed in
a more generic way.
