And you would cripple the 99% usage to aid those users who move disk 
drives physically over to a sparc box AND have more than 31k links to a 
file?
Or is there some usage pattern that I don't appreciate that makes it 
highly likely that people will swap disks into a sparc?  Maybe these hot 
plug ruggedized with plastic covers IDE disks that there was some press 
about being a substitute for DVDs a few months ago?
Frankly, I had doubts about our code that causes CPU order to not be 
used in the disk format, but I was persuaded that it was not a 
measurable performance loss to do it and said yes.
I recognize that you may see things from a perspective that I have not 
experienced, so please articulate on that if so.
