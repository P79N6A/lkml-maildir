Mmm, is it enough for X to just save/restore the registers it modifies ?
Also, i suppose if i am comming from fbdev, what X saves or restores
does not really count, since fbdev knows what relevant thing to save.
Still i sense that there may be some issues involved here, especially
if you switch from text mode to fbdev or between fbdevs while not in X.
