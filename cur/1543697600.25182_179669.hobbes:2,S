I've recently run across CHPOX, Checkpointing for Linux 
(
http://www.cluster.kiev.ua/tasks/chpx_eng.html
). I was wondering if 
anyone else could illuminate me further about using this module with 
2.6.0? I'll probably try this myself later today, after I get test10 
running.
Has any condieration been made for integrating checkpointing directly 
into the main kernel build? I'm thinking 2.7, not 2.6, of course.
