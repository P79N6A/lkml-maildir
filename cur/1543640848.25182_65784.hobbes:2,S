I'm sorry, but I find what you just did extremely offensive.  I
specifically did not copy lkml with my reply.  You therefore have
no right to copy bits from my reply and post them to a public forum.

Where is the user feedback normally associated with the action of
pressing "1-1-1-pause" ?  Most keypads I know display "a" then "b"
then "c" so the user knows what character they're going to get.
