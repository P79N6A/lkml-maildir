Why? There are cases where you may really want to get the work done asap,
so the regular "schedule_work()" is the right thing. While the "delayed"  
thing is for stuff that explicitly doesn't want to happen immediately,
because we expect to aggregate more into it.
Having done a few serial drivers (not because I want to, but because 
nobody else seems to be doing them), I definitely see the need for both. 
For example, the hangup case wants to be done asap, not delayed.
