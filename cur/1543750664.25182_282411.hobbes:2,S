That's not always true, 2.4.x development has not been exactly what I'd
call "stable". IIRC 2.4.15 - the 2.6 fork I think - could corrupt your
filesystems and I don't remember right now if there were more, personally
I've suffered of "weird" behaviours until the new VM was stabilized, and
I've heard of lots of reiser and ext3 problems until both filesystems got
stabilized. I've lost my filesystems 3 times with 2.4, 0 times running 2.5
since 2.5.3x (of course that could be just good luck or bad luck but...)
Of course that only proves your point: that changes may cause bugs 8) but
for me 2.6 has been by far the stablest release linux has ever had, with
some minor issues in each release while at the same time incorporating "big"
changes which is something I can accept as "desktop user". Perhaps 2.6 will
become "rock stable" or "to be used only by servers not desktops" when 2.7
forks?
