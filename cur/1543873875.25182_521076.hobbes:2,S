I'm interested in understanding the state of Linux with regard to
_really_ forcing a filesystem to unmount.
There is a (stale) project at OSDL that has various implementations:
http://developer.osdl.org/dev/fumount/
Its fairly clear that these efforts (e.g. badfs patches) haven't been
given serious consideration for upstream inclusion.  Do others see
value in the ability to _reliably_ force a umount by having Linux
discard all IOs, open files, dirty inode buffers, etc of a "bad"
blockdevice?  The goal is to not impact the availability or integrity
of Linux while doing so.
Is this forced umount work even considered worthwhile by the greater
Linux community?  Is anyone actively working on this?
Mike
