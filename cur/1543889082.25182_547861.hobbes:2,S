more buggy than with the use of a semaphore?

as far as i understand only the thread that locked the mutex can
unlock it (as opposed to semaphores, which can be released by any
thread/process). obviously this doesn't make the code be more
correct. what i don't know is how the kernel behaves when
trying to unlock a mutex the thread doesn't own. another and possibly
more important problem of the code is that in case of being
interrupted by a signal the data that should be protected by the
mutex/semaphore can be accessed/changed by two threads at the same
time.
would the following resolve the problem?
if(mutex_lock_interruptible(&info->write_mtx)) 
        return -ERESTARTSYS
thanks for your comments
