I enable and build my kernel with driver (staticly):
Multi-IO cards (parallel and serial) (in Device Drivers-> Parallel port support 
)
This is what my board say (in console mode) about serial address:
0x08 COM1             DUART8245    0xfc004500 0x07a12000 0x00000001 0x01effc70
0x09 COM2             DUART8245    0xfc004600 0x07a12000 0x00000001 0x01e107d0

Yes, i enable " Support for console on virtual terminal" but i enable
"Non-standard serial port support" option too...
So i recompile without the last one... and i recompile "with Serial drivers
--->" "[*]   Console on 8250/16550 and compatible serial port" perhaps it's
that... And i came back to you.
But, perhaps i've allready tested... i ll check.. it's not a default option ?

I pass parameter directly to the kernel;
Another option i set :
 Default bootloader kernel arguments  x x  x x(console=ttyS0,9600 console=tty0

My image seems to be ok...
