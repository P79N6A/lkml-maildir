The fact that someone can deduce how many hosts are hidden behind
a NAT gateway may, or may not, be a bug ... depending on whether you
think that the NAT is supposed to keep this number a secret.  But there
is a real bug here too.  Suppose you have two hosts behind your NAT
that both have connections to the same host out in internet-land. And
further suppose that both those hosts have the same value for their
incrementing counter that they use for IPID.  And finally suppose that
they both send a fragmented packet to the same port on the same host.
If your NAT router isn't re-writing the IPID, can't the target host get
confused when it sees two fragments that have a source address from your
NAT machine, that have the same IPID ... but really don't belong together?
