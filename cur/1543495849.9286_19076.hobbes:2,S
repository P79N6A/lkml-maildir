Hi Sylvia.

On a network I recently set up for an impoverished school, there are
the following Linux systems:
 1. 386dx/40 with 2x130M hard drive and 16M of RAM which is acting
    as a firewall blocking access to the school's administration
    computers from the computers the school's pupils use.
 2. 486sx/33 with 4.3G hard drive and 80M of RAM which is acting as
    the gateway to the outside world, and also as a bridging firewall
    linking the school's inter-office network to the computing dept
    network. This machine is also running squid as a cacheing web
    proxy for the whole school, and sendmail as the school's email
    mailhost.
 3. 486dx/25 with 3x6.4G hard drives, a 24xCD drive and 128M of RAM
    which is acting as the school's file server.
Personally, I don't believe any of those could even run NT, never mind
serve their designated purposes...
My verdict:   LONG LIVE LINU[SX]
Best wishes from Riley.
