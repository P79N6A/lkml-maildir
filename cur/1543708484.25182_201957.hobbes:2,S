That's a gdb bug, surely?
My gdb seems to work okay:
(gdb) b time.c:3
Breakpoint 1 at 0xc01e8b30: file fs/ntfs/time.c, line 3.
(gdb) b kernel/time.c:3
Breakpoint 2 at 0xc0122540: file kernel/time.c, line 3.
(gdb)
....that seems more or less right.

You can't have that, anyway.. Filenames are already repeating.
Well, I already commited it. It is possible to revert last change, and
we'll get kernel/kgdbstub.c but arch/*/kernel/kgdb.c.
