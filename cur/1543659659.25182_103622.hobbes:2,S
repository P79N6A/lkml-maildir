What about
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
 if (argc != 2 || (argv == 2 && !strcmp(argv[1], "--very-magic"))) {
  char argv0[512];
  memcpy(argv0, 'a', 511);
  argv0[511] = 0;
  char *const args[] = { argv0, "--very-magic", 0 };
  execv(argv[0], args);
 }
 strcpy(argv[0], "my proggy");
 /* your code here */
}
This should ensure that you have 511 bytes of argv[0] storage available,
if I read the previous posts correctly.
For the same effect without the --very-magic argument, you could simply
do an "if (argc != 2 || strlen(argv[0]) != 511)" instead.
Am I smoking crack, or could the above work?
