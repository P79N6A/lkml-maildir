I havn't received the patch but, on Byron Stanoszek's suggestion, I
have compiled 2.4.4 with gcc-2.95.3 to run on it a few days to see if
it is any better.  So far, it appears at least as stable as with
egcs-1.1.2 and most of the swap was freed up this morning for the
first time since 2.4.0.  However, it is pretty full tonight.  I should
know tomorrow if it really made a difference.  This is usually the
state in which I find it locked up the next morning.  It has been up a
little over 2 days now.  Byron actually suggested I use the ac7 patch
but I first wanted to see if the compiler had anything to do with it
without changing anything else.
