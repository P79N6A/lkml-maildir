Does this really need a new device driver?  The existing raid-1
mirroring code allows you to hot-add new disks to the array already.
It also allows you to add hot-add spare disks, so that if one of the
main disks fails the kernel will automatically bring in one of the
spares and start using it as a primary mirror disk.
