OK.  Please try 2.6 and let us know how it changes things.

It will have munched everything else.

Yup.  We don't have any large-streaming-file heuristics in there.
It is the case that if you have recently accessed a file *twice* then its
pages will be preferred over the large streaming file.  But if you've
accessed the valuable file only once, the streaming I/O will evict it.

We have a new syscall in 2.6 (fadvise) with which an app can provide hints
about its access patterns and its desired cache usage.  So, for example,
tar or rsync or whatever could (if told to do so by the user) deliberately
throw away the pagecache after having accessed the file.  But that does
require application modifications.  They're pretty simple though:
+	if (user said to throw away the cache)
+		posix_fadvise64(fd, 0, -1, POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED);
	close(fd);

It's in 2.4 also.  I think 2.4 tends to do the wrong thing because dirty
pages easily make it to the tail of the VM LRU's, which eventually causes
the VM to go off and hunt down mapped pages instead.  2.6 takes more care
to prevent dirty pages from hitting the tail of the LRU.

2.6.6-rc3 would be suitable.
