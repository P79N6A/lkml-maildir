Hello lists,
Just for the archive records: we solved it this way (with the good help of IBM):
# ip route add 10.0.24.0/24 dev eth1 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.24.xxx table 1
# ip route add default via 10.0.24.1 dev eth1 table 1 
# ip rule add from 10.0.24.xxx/32 table 1 priority 500
# ip route flush cache
Which is now run at bootup on the affected servers, giving us the solve we need.
Thanks everyone who replied.
Jan
