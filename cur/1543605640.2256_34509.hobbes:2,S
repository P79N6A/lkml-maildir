It's difficult to say exactly as it's broken already for a rather long time:
	kernels beginning 2.4.9 (if I remeber correctly) have trouble with  
		i810_audio under KDE-2.2
	the same about 2.4.6-ac2 and later ones
Earlier I found some combination (some 2.4.8-ac or soimething similar with 
reverted one of the patches between 2.4.6-ac1 and 2.4.6-ac2) which mostly 
works for KDE with fragment size up to 512 bytes. 2.4.7 worked with any fragment 
size set in kcontrol.
I haven't tested much under GNOME, as I'm starting it very seldom
