Look at drivers/net/tulip/* in 2.4.x kernels.  And submit patches, if
you have an idea :)
For 2.2.x, I am pretty much staying away from tulip.c.  For most
chipsets it is rock solid stable, and I have no desire to change it... 
For a few new or really elcheapo NIC, you need Don Becker's tulip.c
replacement.  Other that that, 2.2.x's tulip.c is golden.
