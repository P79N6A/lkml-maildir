Hi,
I am working on a fix to address this problem. Do you have any testcases
to reproduce the problem ? I have been running bunch of tests with
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB with WARN_ON() and I haven't seen it yet :(
Wondering, if there is any special thing I need to do to reproduce
the problem ? Please let me know.
Thanks,
Badari
