Ahh okay, I wasn't aware of that.  We use a SCSI burner anyways, but most of my
friends who have burners under Linux use IDE burners with Linux 2.4.x, and
therefore need ide-scsi.
I shall keep this in mid should I need to upgrade the burner at all {as it is
getting a bit long in the tooth -- its a Matsushita CR-7502 or something like that)
