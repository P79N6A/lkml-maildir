What if we create a top level category called Patches(or something) and
have a components under that for each tree, patch set.  So anything
thats not from Linus' tree could be put into one of these components.
The natural owner for each of these components would be the maintainer
of the named tree/patch.  Perhaps that is what you are suggesting above
and I have misread it?
