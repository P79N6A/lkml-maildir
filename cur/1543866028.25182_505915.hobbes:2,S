It shows _ALL_ used interrupts in the system. There is no point to let
it show NR_IRQ interrupts with a event count = 0.

PIT is a clock event device and uses IRQ0, where the interrupt count is
displayed:
0:    3022812          0   IO-APIC-edge      timer
Local APIC timer is a clock event device too and the interrupt count is
displayed as well:
LOC:     177795    1755941 
There are no other clock event devices in a PC system at the moment
and /proc/interrupt does not care, whether the interrupt was setup for a
clock event device or something else. It displays the name which is
given in the irqaction struct and does not care what it means. I did not
change the name in the IRQ#0 setup, so it still displays "timer" (which
can either be PIT or HPET), but this is something the interrupt layer
does not know and does not care about.
The special interrupts, which are not handled by the generic IRQ layer
(LOC, NMI) are displayed to have the complete statistics available.
We did not change anything on that. The changed behavior you are
observing (IRQ#0 is not incrementing) is reflecting the reality of the
system. IRQ#0 is not firing, so it does not increment.
