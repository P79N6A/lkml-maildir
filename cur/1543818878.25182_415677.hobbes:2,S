I am using select with a timeout value of 90 ms. But for some reason
occasionally  it comes out of select after more than one second . I
checked the man page but it does not help in concluding if this is ok
or not. Is this expected  or it is a bug. Most of this time is
consumed in   schedule_timeout . I am using 2.5.45 kernel but I
believe the same would  be the true for the latest kernel too. Any
thoughts or suggestion are welcome.
Thanks
Ram Gupta
