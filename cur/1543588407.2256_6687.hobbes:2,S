That's an optimization, not a correctness issue.

This works regardless of what the open() returns. What does not work
is using MAX_LOG (assuming it is constant) later in the following form:

I see no way around computing the maximum of the inlogfd[i] values +1.
(Which can of course be done just after the opens above. Note that the
last opened fd _is_ guaranteed to get the highest number; FD_SET is
one of the library routines where you can be pretty confident they
don't open fds...)
Btw. there are two problems even assuming you do get contiguous fds:
- an off by one error in the case of argc > MAX_LOG, the first
  argument of select() is maximum fd _plus one_
- from an optimization POV it is highly advisable to take only the
  real maximum anyway.
