Hello:
I wrote a driver to use LPC bus in a geode sc1200. For now I am able
to transmit an read or write "I/O cycle" to the LPC.
What I want to do now is to read or write to the LPC using a "Memory cycle".
Anyone knows how can I archieve this?
is there another list more suitable for my question?
Thanks,
Carlos
