Subject: Out of memory in 2.3.50-3.

This has been covered alot lately, but I wonder if there has been any
improvements to it?  2.3.50-3 (and all before) die a horrible death when
they encounter a OOM.  I noticed some small "improvement" in pre3 today vs
2.3.49.  It tries to kill a few other processes to free some memory, but
after a few attempts it always settles on VM: Killing process klogd where
it loops forever.  Before pre3 it just went streight in the killing klogd
loop.
Is there any chance of getting the old 2.2 behavior back?  My program,
when run against 2.2.14aa10 (and I guess 2.2.14?  Andrea?) works great.
Eventually the bad prog segfaults and the result is a huge core file, but
otherwise things are fine.  Please can we have that in 2.4! :)
The simple program I use to test is at the bottom.  Im sorry if this has
been covered to death or so... But I'm interested to know how this can be
fixed for 2.4

int main(void)
{
	char *x; int a, b;
	for (a = 0; a < 512; a++)
	{
		x = (char *) malloc(1024*1024);
		for (b = 0; b < 1024*1024; b++)
			x[b] = '\0';
	}
	return (0);
