I find this advice a bit odd.  I am not aware of
any prohibition of comments inside functions.
As with comments outside functions, they should
serve a worthwhile purpose, of course.  One might
debate whether this particular comment added by
Anand was sufficiently valuable to be worth
having.
But I don't agree to a blanket prohibition on
comments inside functions.
