Agreed.  That's why I've been saying all along that once the parent has
been moved to dpm_off, we should either block or fail child
registrations.  Drivers trying to register a child at such times are 
clearly buggy anyway.
What we are really trying to agree on is how the PM core should handle 
child registrations just before and while the parent is suspending.  
Drivers trying to register a child at such times need not be buggy at 
all; they may simply have lost a race.
I agree that the core needs to protect itself, but I also think that
drivers should need minimal changes -- preferably none.  If the core
becomes moderately more complicated as a tradeoff for keeping drivers a
little simpler, then IMO it's a win since there are lots and lots of
drivers but only one PM core.

But you do agree that "drivers must not register new children after 
->suspend() has run" is correct, right?  You just don't think it goes 
far enough.

In doing this you are putting a tremendous extra burden on drivers.  
You force _them_ to handle registration failure caused by an impending
suspend, something the driver has no way to know about beforehand!
In effect, you are trying to take the extra complication my patch adds
to the PM core and instead add that complication to _every_
hotpluggable driver.  This is not a good approach.

The new patch is no better.  If a driver tries to create a new child
just before its suspend method is called, the registration will fail
with -EBUSY for no reason the driver is aware of.  So now the driver
has to detect the failure (which many drivers don't do!) and figure out
how to retry it later on.

Of course they should check.  But they shouldn't have to deal with 
failures that need to be retried for no good reason.
In the long run, I still believe the best approach is to tell drivers
beforehand they should stop registering children.  That will make both
of us happy: The PM core can fail all later registration attempts with
no qualms, and drivers won't have to worry about unexpected failures.  
How many subsystems register new children at arbitrary times?  The
earlier we can fix them up, the better.

And I think it's a bad idea to make drivers responsible for recovering 
from these failures.  Especially since the effort writing that recovery 
code would be better spent in writing "prevent_new_children" and 
"allow_new_children" methods.

But this is different.  The failures you want to add are things which 
_should_ succeed -- in fact they would succeed if they were delayed 
until after the system wakes back up.
I admit these failures will be very rare, since they depend on a race
with a small window.  Here's a compromise: I'll agree to let these
registrations fail if you'll agree to add "prevent_new_children" and
"allow_new_children" methods along with the new pm_ops patch you and
Alex have prepared.  Then drivers and subsystems can implement the
methods later on, after which they won't have to worry about spurious
registration failures.
The prevent_new_children methods should be called in a separate initial
forward pass through the dpm_active list -- rather like the reverted
lock_all_devices() routine.  Similarly for the allow_new_children 
methods (a final backward pass like unlock_all_devices()).
The PM notifier messages can serve as a "prevent new children" 
announcement to prevent registration of devices with no parent.

Um.  Nobody has mentioned this before.  Are you saying that a disk 
drive (for example) which has been spun down and put in a low-power 
runtime-PM state must be spun up again before the system can suspend?

Actually you can simplify the whole thing by getting rid of 
dev->power.lock entirely.  Protect the "sleeping" flag by dpm_list_mtx.
You could even change the flag from bool to an enum, with a special
"GONE" state for devices that were unregistered during a system sleep
transition.  Once you do that, the whole thing starts to look a lot
like a simplified version of my patch.
How does this sound?
