I think the request is valid, even for those planning to comply with the
GPL.  I'm working on an embedded device that has a similar requirement.
The code will not be submitted upstream, as the hardware is customized,
but of course we will provide driver sources to those who buy the
hardware as the GPL requires.  It would be useful to have a private
ioctl range for this.  And please don't tell me not to use an ioctl()
interface - it's the simplest way to communicate between kernel and
userspace, and since the code is not going upstream it's our choice.
