As far as I know they have not been integrated into the Xfree tree.  I
believe there were some disagreements about extending the Xv API since
GATOS added some extentions to support the AIW video capture cards.  I
suppose someone could try and submit a patch again and see if they'll
take it.  
Also there is some work on a new XvMC interface that would allow for
extended DVD acceleration.

I have to say that I have absolutely no idea. I only use little-endian 
machines myself (and 99% x86). 
Also, which ATI Xv stuff are you talking about? The ATI Rage128 and ATI 
Radeon Xv code was at least a few months ago completely separate from
the 
ATI Rage code (the first two were in X CVS, while the latter only
existed 
in the gatos version). 
Has the Gatos code (or some other code) maybe been integrated into 4.1.0 
now? I haven't followed X CVS for the last months very closely..
