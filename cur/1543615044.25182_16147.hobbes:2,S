Have you asked Linus and Marcelo why your patches aren't being 
accepted?  Linus and Hans Reiser eventually sorted out what 
was required for getting reiserfs into the kernel, though it 
took some negotiation and compromise of the part of the reiserfs
folks.  I imagine you can do the same.
It's a no-brainer that we all want fast disk I/O.
