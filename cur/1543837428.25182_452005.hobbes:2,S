It might be a bit out of the scope of this thread, but why do some many 
subsystems use the /dev/sd* namespace?
Real SCSI devices use it.
The USB mass storage driver uses it.
libata uses it.
I'd expext SATA or PATA devices at /dev/hd* or perhaps at /dev/ata* - 
but why are they at /dev/sd*?

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
