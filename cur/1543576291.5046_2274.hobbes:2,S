Hello,
    I am having a weird time problem when mounting Novell 5.1 volumes with
ncpmount.  The Novell server is located in a different timezone, and once I
mount the volume my system time gets set back 5 hours (to match the Novell
server).  I am also loosing my mounts periodically.  The system is running
Red Hat 6.2 with stock 2.2.14-5.0 (up) kernel.  Can anyone point me to doc
on how to fix this, or to the ncpfs maintainers so I can bug them.  TIA!
