Just FYI...
I have kernel 2.4.22 + swsusp 1.1-rc7 running without problems on the
very same machine (Asus L3800C, BIOS 121a).
I fiddled a little with a home grown suspend script until I got swsusp
reliably working with older versions (0.9-pre and before) and it still
works perfectly for me; the suspend script from the swsusp project was
too generic and complicated for me ;) I have attached my version in case
someone's interested in it.
One point that proofs to be a good idea is to remove any unnecessary
drivers before suspending, like USB, Firewire and ethernet and to
re-insert them afterwards. The attached script does this.

# It assumes that XFree is running on VT7 and that VT12 is more
# or less unallocated for debugging output.
# It will remove safe-to-remove drivers before suspend and re-insert them
# afterwards (USB, Firewire, Ethernet, etc.) as well as ejecting a built-in
