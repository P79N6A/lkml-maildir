2) Was the right answer for my own driver set, because it will
   not loose data and is a common situation the user space app is
   supposed to handle properly. 
The only arguable case is if we use a count of 0 after 
calculating (count & (align-1)), because we would basically
return EOF here instead of a short read (in  the read case).
But it can be worked around by disallowing seeks or contraining the
seeks ;-)
PS: I know, we are talking about (short) writes here, but the
   topic needs insight and I just handled these problems recently.
