That's strange. I did some testing with a small application (blockdev) 
that uses this ioctl yesterday, and strace did not show any difference 
between the correct and incorrect definitions. I could change the 
definition back and forth and the application continued to work 
correctly. I'll have to go back and figure out what I was doing wrong :-)
