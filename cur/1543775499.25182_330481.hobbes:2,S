Rule #3 from 
http://www.streamload.com/About/Legal_eng.asp?page=id73#
is pretty clear about what applies if you have a trial account (which
seems to be what you have since you say you'll cancel your account if
they charge you anything):
  3. Do not circumvent Freeloader download restrictions.
  Any attempt to circumvent Freeloader trial account restrictions will
  result in a permanent banishment from the Streamload community. This
  includes (3a) files with an invalid or disguised file format; (3b)
  encryption; (3c) steganography and/or (3d) creating multiple
  freeloader accounts.
You can interpret that whatever way you like, but if you're that
cavalier with your data, hey, I'm not sure _I'd_ trust your judgement
about which filesystem to trust.  :-)
