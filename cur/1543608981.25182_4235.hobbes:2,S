The VIA bug isn't a problem: The fix doesn't cause performance problems
to people unaffected by the bug, it just prints an annoying message to
people who see it triggered by bug #2 (Neptune).
The Neptune bug (which seems much more widespread than expected) is a
much larger problem - it's hard to detect without performance
degradation and currently it isn't known which chipsets are affected. It
is known that Intel Mercury and Intel Neptune (old P6 chipsets) are. But
how about others ... ?
