very good. Could you try another thing, and set the rt_cpu_limit to less
than the CPU utilization 'top' reports during the test (or to less than
the DSP CPU utilization in the stats), to deliberately trigger the
limiting code? This both tests the limit and shows the effects it has. 
(there should be xruns and a large Delay Maximum.)
