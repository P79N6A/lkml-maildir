Well, yeah, if a filesystem doesn't have a global index, the whole
path could just be stuffed into the handle.
But there's not much point in that, is there?  And because the
interface bypasses normal access checking on parent directories, it
has security implications, making it not generally useful.
Specifically, it is not useful for the "unprivileged file server" case
that Peter was suggesting.
