Not a lossy network; it's switched, there are only three machines on it
(discounting UML instances), and all the links are far from saturation.
I was seeing this with under 30 packets per second inbound to the
failing machine.
I suspected network driver problems from the start, hence my copying Tim
:) the kernel used on this box is non-preempted, which rules out locking
problems, I'd think. I'll hack up a test that sends and receives huge
UDP packets, and see how it does.
(netcat should do the trick.)
... well, netcatting this file around via UDP yields such wildly
divergent values, even on an unsaturated network, that I'm inclined to
disregard it entirely: transfers to *localhost* of a 3Mb file yield <90K
at the other end, and I doubt the localhost link should be lossy!
Anyone know a reliable way to test this?
(and surely if it was just packet loss, we wouldn't see *every* packet
getting lost, for *hours*, as we saw here? I left five UDP NFS sessions
frozen on Saturday night, and they were still frozen on Sunday morning,
several NFS servers sending the same data to the failing client over and
over every two seconds without fail, and the client seemingly
disregarding all of it.)

Indeed.
