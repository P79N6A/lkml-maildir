but you can run the audio tasks as SCHED_FIFO?
(you do not have to run the tasks as root, you only have to do the renice
as root.)

you can tune the actual weight of importance by decrasing the priority of
the CPU-hog (or increasing the priority of the interactive task) a bit.
But ideally you'd want to decrease the priority of the CPU hog, because
that way you protect it not only from your 'own' interactive tasks, but
from other activities on the system as well.
