Hi,
I am using Linux 2.2.18 with vm-global-7 and raid-0.90
applied.  The system became virtually unresponsive earlier
and after a reboot, I found the following in my logs.  By
unresponsive I mean ping would work but telnet for example
would connect and just sit there.
Jan  2 04:36:27 continuum kernel: VM: killing process
apache
Jan  2 04:40:15 continuum kernel: VM: killing process
cmdnsqueue
Jan  2 04:41:04 continuum kernel: VM: killing process cron
What conditions would trigger this situation?  Why would
the kernel decide to kill cron and Apache?
Cheers,
Shane
