Trond,
I've been plagued with the same messages ever since the early days of
knfsd, and have played with the system shutdown sequence endlessly in
search of a solution.  It doesn't happen all the time, and seems related
to something that tries to hold an open file handle to a remote system
during shutdown.  My sysV sequence most certainly does not try to shut
down the network prior to the nfs client subsystem - these messages are
triggered _after_ nfs is downed.  Something is trying to hang on for dear
life, I guess..
Steve
