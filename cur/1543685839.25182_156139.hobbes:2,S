Looks good, but:
- I doubt this could explain the alteration pattern (1 byte every 512).
- Corruption also occured with cipher_null (which ignores the IV).
I just noticed a related thread: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/8/6/313
("Device-backed loop broken in 2.6.0-test2?")
A side note: Doesn't crypto/crypto_null.c need this fix ?:
 static void null_encrypt(void *ctx, u8 *dst, const u8 *src)
-{ }
+{ memmove(dst, src, NULL_BLOCK_SIZE); }
 
 static void null_decrypt(void *ctx, u8 *dst, const u8 *src)
-{ }
+{ memmove(dst, src, NULL_BLOCK_SIZE); }
-
