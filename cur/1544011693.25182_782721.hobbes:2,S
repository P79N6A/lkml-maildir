I guess you applied Ken's patch from email and had it in -mm? We have a 
new version of that patch from Ken now based on Yinghai's bugreport - only 
lightly tested for now.

Subject: [PATCH] sched: fix uneven per-cpu task_group share distribution
Impact: fix group scheduling behavior
While testing CFS scheduler on linux-2.6-tip tree:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/linux-2.6-tip
We found that task which is pinned to a CPU could be starved relative to its
allocated fair share.
The per-cpu sched_enetity load share calculation in tg_shares_up /
update_group_shares_cpu distributes total task_group's share among all CPUs
for a given SD domain, this would dilute task_group's per-cpu share because
it distributes share to CPU that even has no load.  The trapped share is now
un-consumable and it leads to fair share starvation on the runnable CPU.
Peter was right that it is still required for the low level function to make
distinction between a boosted share that don't have any load and actual tg
share that should be distributed among CPUs in which the tg is running.
Patch to add that boost and we think the scheduler should only boost one
times of tg shares over all empty CPU that don't have any load for the
specific task_group in order to bound maximum temporary boost that a given
task_group can have.
