That reminds me... a while ago, I toyed with the idea of having DMA
support in pmac_zilog. The case where it would work well is typically
for things that have a known sized frame. If that information was
provided down to the driver, I could setup the DMA descriptor for
that frame size & have it interrupt me when the frame is complete,
along with a timeout set to the estimated time for receiving such
a frame + X% (I was thinking +20%)
