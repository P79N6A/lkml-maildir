I'm aware of that. ;) I'm well aware of the architecture needed to support
HT.

Performance differences *are* quite relevant when it comes to thread
scheduling; the two virtual CPUS are not necessarily equivalent in
performnace.

I suspect HT/SMT be common for people who have multimedia systems, for video
editing and high-end gaming.
I doubt we'll see SMT toasters, though.

An HT system is still a single, phsyical processor; HT is not equivalent to
a multicore chip, either. Much depends on memory and connection models; a
dual-core chip may be faster or slower than two similar physical SMP
processors. depending on the architecture.
I was speaking in terms of Intel's push to add HT to all of their P4s.
Systems with a single CPU will likely have HT; that still doesn't make them
as powerful as a true dual processor (or dual core CPU) system.

Eaxctly. This is why HT is not the same thing as two physical CPUs. The OS
must be aware of this the effectively schedule jobs. So I think we generally
agree.

A good point.
