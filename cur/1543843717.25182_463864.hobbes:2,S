Good. So give me concrete examples of those cases that you saw and tell
me exactly what those people you were working with were attempting to
achieve.

Either ltt had a userbase or it didn't. To say that all its users went
out and added their own tracepoints is to not know enough about the project
and so too is it to say that none of its users could actually just use
it out of the box without modifying it. Now, as an outsider, trying to
measure how many users were using it without modifying it is like
trying to figure out how many Linux users there are out there. There's
a silent majority and there's those that need customization. Guess
who you've been talking to?
Strange, come to think of it I don't remember *ever* getting an
email from you while being the maintainer or seing *any* emails by you
on the ltt lists -- that's indicative of mindset, namely that you
personally assumed you knew all about tracing and didn't need us to make
suggestions to help you AND that you personally never found it relevant
to contribute back. That's like me going off forking the kernel, adding
features to it and then calling the kernel developers incompetent when
they come around saying that what I'm doing is wrong. Who's patronizing
who here?
And I submit to you an idea which I submitted to Ingo yesterday and have
not yet received feedback on. Here's static markup as it could be
implemented:
The plain function:
 int global_function(int arg1, int arg2, int arg3)
 {
         ... [lots of code] ...
         x = func2();
         ... [lots of code] ...
 }
The function with static markup:
 int global_function(int arg1, int arg2, int arg3)
 {
         ... [lots of code] ...
         x = func2(); /*T* @here:arg1,arg2,arg3 */
         ... [lots of code] ...
 }
The semantics are primitive at this stage, and they could definitely
benefit from lkml input, but essentially we have a build-time parser
that goes around the code and automagically does one of two things:
a) create information for binary editors to use
b) generate an alternative C file (foo-trace.c) with inlined static
   function calls.
And there might be other possibilities I haven't thought of.
This beats every argument I've seen to date on static instrumentation.
Namely:
- It isn't visually offensive: it's a comment.
- It's not a maintenance drag: outdated comments are not alien.
- It doesn't use weird function names or caps: it's a comment.
- There is precedent: kerneldoc.
And it does preserve most of the key things those who've asked for
static markup are looking for. Namely:
- Static instrumentation
- Mainline maintainability
- Contextualized variables
When I was still part of the ltt development process we had accumulated
a huge amount of ideas of how we could optimize and fix stuff here and
there. We were never actually ever able to reduce these to practice
because folks like you never bothered interfacing with us and the
attitude on the lkml was exactly as I described. We spent our time
chasing kernels.

Hmm... beats me why even the systemtap folks would themselves admit
to performance limitations.

Ah, so it's ok for kprobes to have implementation issues, but not ltt.
Somehow there's this magic thought recurring throughout this thread
that the limitations of dynamic instrumentation are trivial to fix,
but those of static instrumentation are unrecoverable. *That* is a
fallacy if I ever saw one. I'm willing to admit that a combination of
dynamic editing and static instrumentation is a good balance, but Jes
please drop this discourse, it's not constructive.
