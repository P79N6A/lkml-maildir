Then the proposed solution won't work either...
Just do an xyz.h:
#ifdef NEED_BIG_UGLY_FUNC
/* Prototype, gets pulled in when called */
void big_ugly_func(int this, void *that);
#else
/* Inline definition, gets nuked */
static inline void big_ugly_func(int this, void *that) {}
#endif
while xyz.c goes into a library (*.a) with the full definition. Gets
compiled, but not linked in.
What is wrong with that?
