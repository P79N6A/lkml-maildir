(Sorry for sending this a second time... I figured someone
interested may miss it due to the wrong subject line.  Sorry 
again.)
Bzzt, wrong... the 'b' has nothing to do with bzip2 as stated
in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/kbuild/commands.txt :
"Note: the difference between 'zImage' files and 'bzImage' files is that
'bzImage' uses a different layout and a different loading algorithm,
and thus has a larger capacity.  Both files use gzip compression.
The 'bz' in 'bzImage' stands for 'big zImage', not for 'bzip'!"
For the rest of all I know about bzlilo, bzImage, bzdisk, etc.,
read that file.  Have a good one! :)
