Both work. However, dep_bool works in different way you expected.
Michael's intention was to introduce "typed" config variables of
two separate types:
   bool (with "y"/"n" as legal values)
   tristate ("y"/"m"/"n" legal)
and not to mix them to simplify parsing in the future.
In effect any correct dependency for dep_bool should also be "bool".
"m" is incorrect value for bool. So "m" as a dependency for dep_bool
is treated like incorrect value -> defaulting to "n".
It may be changed, IMO (-> defaulting any incorrect value to "y"),  but
such a change should be started as modification of documentation and parsers,
not config files...
The other solution is to have two separate dep_bool* function defaulting
incorrent values to different correct values (->"y", ->"n"). (IMHO worse)
