Actually, there is no need to store kdev_t on disk at all, nor is there a
need to store device name.  By the time you have located the device, you
don't need that information any more.  I think that stuff is just a hold
over from when in-core and on-disk data was the same, and should be removed.
Cheers, Andreas
