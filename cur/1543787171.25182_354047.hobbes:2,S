Why would a beginner compile a kernel ?
I would even say this would be bad if you can avoid them to go through
all the documentations of each option. :)

I doubt we can, at least not in the current status.
And requiring more external tools as lspci, dmidecode, etc, is probably
not right.
More I am thinking of it, more it seems that the hardware detection
softwares (lspci, dmidecode, lsusb) should be stripped down and probably
included somewhere in the kernel tree... But wouldn't be too much to pay
for having an autoconfig ? (I mean maintenance, update, debug, ... will
be way out of the scope of the kernel).
Did anybody had some though about this previously (I tried to look in
the archive of the LKM but didn't find anything relevant) ?

ncurses, Qt, Gtk, ... (aka menuconfig, xconfig, gconfig).
