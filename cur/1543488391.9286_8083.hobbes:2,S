OK, I'll do that tomorrow.
But my memory tells me this:
  - Host Unreachable should be ignored for an *existing* TCP connection
    (it is considered an transient error)
  - Host Unreachable should make a TCP connection *setup* fail
If this last rule doesn't apply what's the use of sending the HU anyway ? ..
(well maybe some routing protocols/software use them ?)
