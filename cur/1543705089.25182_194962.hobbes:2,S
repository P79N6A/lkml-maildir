I just checked, and I did have the SCO support switched on. Shows that
the name can not be trusted... ;-)

No oops, rebuilding the kernel with serial support built in so I can
attach serial console. After that I should be able to capture any

I am currently using 2.6.1 proper, but saw it in 2.6.0 and a couple of

I will give 2.6.2-rc2 a try over the weekend.
