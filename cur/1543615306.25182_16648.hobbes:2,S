    The kdev_none change might not be correct, please check.
Indeed, I would say it is not.
    -        if (!is_local_disk(sb->s_dev) && MAJOR(sb->s_dev))
    +        if (!is_local_disk(sb->s_dev) && !kdev_none(sb->s_dev))
                 go_sync(sb, remount_flag);
Without studying the surrounding code, I conjecture that
the test MAJOR(sb->s_dev) was meant to exclude anonymous
devices (with major 0), not only NODEV.
