What kind of problems? Are you experiencing very bursty
swap behaviour?  If so, that should be fixed, or at least
less, in 2.2.15 (pre-4 and later).
2.2.>13?? are set up in such a way that the system frees
up 256kB of memory _minimum_ when swapping, this is just
too much to swap out in one asynchronous transaction, it
will also cause an application (the one that's currently
doing a memory allocation) to block on that swap I/O and
consequently stall.
The patch to fix this (partly) has been sent to Alan Cox
yesterday evening...
regards,
Rik
