Hi
My merged performance patchset (-ck) containing
O(1) + batch scheduling
Preemptible
Low Latency
Compressed Caching or
AA VM addons
XFS
ALSA
Supermount
is now available with the last five as separate optional patches for those who 
have asked for it as ck10. Note this is basically unchanged from ck9. Those 
who are not using XFS are recommended to upgrade to this and NOT add the xfs 
patch. The option of the AA VM changes makes this version suitable for SMP 
now.
