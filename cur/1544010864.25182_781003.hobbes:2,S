I guess there are a couple of things to consider. If it fits in fairly
nicely and can be optimized out for the users that don't care, then
integration generally makes sense. In this case however you have a large
and insular block that is ifdef'ed in and selected by Kconfig, suggesting
that the only benefit is for your driver which wishes to tie in to parts
of uio_pdrv_genirq, with there being no benefits the other way. This sort
of situation suggests you are better off layering and simply exposing the
functionality you need from uio_pdrv_genirq. This was certainly the case
with pata_platform as well, and it worked out pretty well there compared
to hacking it in-place.
