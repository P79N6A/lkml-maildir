Hrm.  No swap was in use at all when it happened; there was >9Gb free.
Since I started watching memory usage (mid-October), I've never seen this
particular machine use more than ~ 200Mb or so of swap.  The workload
generates a lot of disk access and most of hte "used" memory is cache.
/proc/meminfo right now shows:
cbs:~ > cat /proc/meminfo
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  4175282176 4049809408 125472768        0 155308032 3207811072
Swap: 9606946816    12288 9606934528
MemTotal:      4077424 kB
MemFree:        122532 kB
MemShared:           0 kB
Buffers:        151668 kB
Cached:        3132616 kB
SwapCached:         12 kB
Active:         608876 kB
Inactive:      3019980 kB
HighTotal:     3211264 kB
HighFree:       112708 kB
LowTotal:       866160 kB
LowFree:          9824 kB
SwapTotal:     9381784 kB
SwapFree:      9381772 kB
which is pretty typical.  Should it be able to OOM when there is swap
free?  Or when most of the used memory is cache?

done.  I'll wait until the crash happens again.  It could be a few weeks.
What will vm_gfp_debug do -- what should I look for when it happens?
