Yeah, good points. I know, I'm being paranoid intentionally since much 
of the kernel is so SMP oriented. I'm thinking in terms of large scale
concurrency since the structures of the kernel are fundamentally SMP and
which is tightly related to RT performance. There's a lot of overlap
between both world as it concerns locking structures, fine grainedness.
The really appealing aspect of this project that the same things that
make Linux such a high performance SMP system out of the box is exactly
what will also give it outstanding RT performance in both UP and SMP
configurations. The fine grained locking issues seem to be largely done
and this work is going to push those boundaries even more.
I know what you're saying about thread run subsets with relation to
priority (again good points), but I'm looking at large picture issues
and how this system is going to behave as all parts work together. We
haven't done this just yet and it's too immature a system to do so
until it becomes more stable and popular. It's a different point of 
view than what you're talking about. :)
