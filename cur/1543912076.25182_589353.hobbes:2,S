It's entirely possible that what happens is that the X scheduling is just 
a slightly unstable system - which effectively would turn a small 
scheduling difference into a *huge* visible difference.
And the "small scheduling difference" might be as simple as "if the 
process slept for a while, we give it a bit more CPU time". And then you 
get into some unbalanced setup where the X scheduler makes it sleep even 
more, because it fills its buffers.
Or something. I can easily see two schedulers that are trying to 
*individually* be "fair", fighting it out in a way where the end result is 
not very good.
I do suspect it's probably a very interesting load, so I hope Ingo looks 
more at it, but I also suspect it's more than just the kernel scheduler.
