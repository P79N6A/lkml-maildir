Ok - the "change-marker-for-relative-numbering" patch I wanted gone is
gone.  Good.
I don't know what "patch against that" you have in mind.  But I guess
that doesn't matter.
I will make sure I am in sync with that rc4 + that mm rollup patch +
whatever else follows it in mm, for whatever other work I do.
Thanks.
