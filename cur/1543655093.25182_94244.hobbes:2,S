Sorry, you're going to have to explain where this extra branch is, I
don't see it.

What performance advantages of consistent memory?  Can you name any
non-fully-consistent platform where consistent memory is preferable
when it is not strictly required?  For, all the non-consistent
platforms I'm aware of getting consistent memory means disabling the
cache and therefore is to be avoided wherever it can be.
