Rik,
The simple way around this is to process the IO request list
**backwards** when you parse the elements and do the disk IO.  This is
what we do in NetWare mirroring (Novell figured this out after about 7
years of putzing around with different elevator routines), and gets
around the problem of folks constantly adding new entries that starve
those lower on the list.  The implementation requires an 'A' and 'B'
list of IO requests.  What we do is just take the entire list at the
head, zero the list head and tail, and process the list from a local
"head" in the async IO process (which allows folks to keep adding new
requests to the queue).  
Hope this helps.
Jeff
