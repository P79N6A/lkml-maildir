The discussion ended with me asking for someone to send a patch.  That
hasn't happened yet.  I don't want to have to troll through 20-30 messages
and try to work out what patch we ended up with - that's the way in which
mistakes occur.
Linus has now reverted e4f0ae0ea63caceff37a13f281a72652b7ea71ba.  Now,
please, could someone send a patch against either current -git or against
2.6.19?  One which includes a descriptin of what it does, and why.
Thanks.
