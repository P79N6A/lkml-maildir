I have another update:
some might know the memtest86 utility.
it has three ways of detecting the memory size "BIOS - Std", "BIOS - All" and 
"Probe"
on my Athlon Mainboard (which has no Problems with 2.4.19 or later kernels) 
all methods show the same (or nearly same) ammount of memory.
on my Epox 4G4A+ i845g Mainboard, which has all the Problems Jens Wiesecke 
has, it's different:
BIOS - Std : 640k (!!)
BIOS - All : 4091M (!!!!)
Probe      : 511M (which seems correct as I have 512 MB Ram and 1 MB is shared 
graphics ram)
