There is no doubt that Jesper did explicitly ACK the patch.
We are ONLY discussing whether his informal ACK can be translated into 
an "Acked-by:" line.
The line I mentioned only exists if "Acked-by:" is considered a formal 
tag someone must explicitely give, and not an informal indication that 
someone agrees with the patch. But in this case, we should better 
require people to give explicit "Acked-by:" lines, like we already 
require for "Signed-off-by:" lines.
I've seen many cases where people other than me added "Acked-by:" tags 
when there was only a "Makes good sense to me." or "Fine with me.", but 
no formal "Acked-by:" given.
If "Acked-by:" should be considered a formal tag, it
- should be documented in Documentation/SubmittingPatches and
- the practice must change to always require people to give
  a formal "Acked-by:".
