Quick question,
I am using the latest ixgb driver (1.0.126) as stated both on Intel's 
website and here: 
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=645203
After a number of hours, sometimes days, I will get this error on the 
console and the box locks up:
ixgb: eth2: ixgb_clean_tx_irq: Detected Tx Unit Hang
Intel told us that the 126 version of this driver was supposed to fix this 
problem.  Is there anyone from Intel on this list or someone who has dealt 
with this issue and has a potential fix?
The Intel Board is 10GBe PCI-X card in a HP DL385.
Can anyone offer some assistance with this issue?
Please CC as I am not on lkml or taroon mailing lists, thanks.
Justin.
