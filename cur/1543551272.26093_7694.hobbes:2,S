This is what I wrote one day a long time ago:
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
my ($buffer, $pos, $gzmagic);
$gzmagic = "\037\213";
open OUT, "| gunzip" or die "cannot find gunzip; $!\n";
while(1) {
  exit 1 unless defined($pos = read STDIN, $buffer, 8192) and $pos > 0;
  next unless ($pos = index $buffer, $gzmagic) >= 0;
  print OUT substr $buffer, $pos;
  last;
}
print OUT <STDIN>;
exit 0;
Yes, I know that I should not mix 'read' with stdio but it worked
every time I tried the above. :-)
Can we go back now to kernel issues?
