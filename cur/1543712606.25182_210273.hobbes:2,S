What do you mean "setting policy"? Your program is attempting to use an
obsolete kernel ABI. Of course it should "have an opinion" about that...
The issue is merely whether or not to issue an EINVAL, in order to force
users to upgrade to an updated version of "mount":
For 2.7.x, I'm rather of a mind to do just that in order to finally
clean up the wretched struct nfs_mount and eliminate all the unused
backward-compatibilty crap, but doing so in the middle of 2.6.x is not
an option (particularly given that the SELinux mount changes came as
late as they did).
Cheers,
