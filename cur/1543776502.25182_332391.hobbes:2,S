I noticed something ... the fact that elapsed times on kernel compiles
etc got significantly faster with lower HZ values ... see for example
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mbligh/abat/perf/kernbench.elm3b67.png
Sorry, it's getting a bit scrunched in there ... I need to make it bigger
and filter old details stuff out better.
I think we're talking between 2.6.12-git5 and 2.6.12-git6 right? I can
confirm more explicitly if really need be. 48s -> 45.5s elapsed.
