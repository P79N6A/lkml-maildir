I belive there were some serialization issues in that version of the driver.
Things have been rewritten substantially since the driver that was included
to 2.4.20. The 2.5.54 driver should be relatively unchanged with my patch
as I believe most of the serialization issues have been resolved.

I noticed this too, but long after 20 minutes. After about 10 hours of continuous
download from a local mirror @ 250kb/sec things started to get interesting. As 
you mention, removing the card cleans things out.

There are a number of problems with the 2.4.20 driver and I recommend using
the latest from David Gibson's site: 
http://www.ozlabs.org/people/dgibson/dldwd
Incidently, it's what David recommends as well -- I've personally been using
the testing version with great success. There are still some issues though;
I'm pinning them down with the help from the comments David has provided me.
Most of the work in getting this driver working seems to have been done in the
newest versions -- it's just the little things now.
