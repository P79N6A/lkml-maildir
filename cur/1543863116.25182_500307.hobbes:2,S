Hello everyone,
I'm writing a driver for an USB device that has one configuration with
several interfacies and one of them is a HID interface. So when I check
this interface whether it's claimed (usb_interface_claimed), I find out
that it is, and it's claimed by the HID driver. So here is the
question: how can I ask the HID driver to unclaim this very interface
for me so that I can use it? The HID driver is needed for some other
devices, so I can't just rmmod it.
Thanks in advice.
Regards,
Ivan Ukhov.
