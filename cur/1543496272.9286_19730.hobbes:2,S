The user space utility concept has a problem: What will be the kernel 
boot time, and what is the time when the filesystems are mounted or 
checked? Also a use space utility may cause a time warp on every boot.

I mean: settimeofday() and related functions should also set the RTC 
immediately. That's what the average user expects the program to do.

Maybe let's name a popular example: When installing SuSE Linux, 
there's no way to set the system time (other than escaping to a shell 
and calling "date -s"), and the timezone is zero during installation. 
The RTC is asumed to be UTC. After installation, the system time 
warps. (You can see it when checking the installation times with "rpm 
-qi"). If things were just fine, we would not have such problems.

I think I know what you are talking about ;-)

Aha.
