I will include this in next patch series. This is a fix so it should be
ok for post monday.

What I have done in my tree is to set up following dependency tree in
the top-lvel Makefile:
prepare
  +-prepare0
     +-archprepare
        +-prepare1
           +-prepare2
              +-prepare3
prepare0 needs archprepare, but archprepare may need prepare1.
So this should be OK on all architectures.
And you can go back relying solely on prepare in um Makefile.

It certainly look much much better than anything I could come up with.
You should persuade Jeff and Paolo to test and include this.
A few notes..

This part could be moved to a Kbuild file so we have access to
full kbuild functionality - and thus anebling full dependency check
on user-offset.c

filechk is only relevant if there is a risk that user_constants.h is
rebuild but there is no changes in output file. We do this for version.h
but I do not see any big need for it here.

Same comment as above.
