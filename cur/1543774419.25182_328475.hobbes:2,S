Easily solved, using the same method OS/2 added Extended Attribute
support to FAT.  Of course, things may break if you try to manipulate
the encrypted file under Windows (e.g. deleting those files would leave
some garbage blocks behind), but breakage should be minor and relatively
easy to fix.

Meh.  It's nice to have encrypting to be transparent.  Unless your
editor supports gpg/crypt/etc., you'll need to decrypt the file to a
temporary area, edit the file, and then re-encrypt.  Much easier to make
a mistake and lose data, or leave traces of the cleartext data.
Besides, the encryption would be optional, and hence not being shoved
down the user's throat.  If you don't like it, don't use it.
