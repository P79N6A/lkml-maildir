We tried the latest errata kernel from redhat.com (2.4.9-21). This one still
has the same problem. We saw exactly the same problem at the same place in
the code. I can add the oops here if you like. 
(link to the original mail for this thread:

)
We are trying to fix this problem but did not have much success yet. I will
happy to provide any more info if somebody needs.
Raghu.
