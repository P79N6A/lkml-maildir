To achieve this, you have to set an arbitrary limit on the maximal FS size.
I have updated a patch originally from David Gibson to enforce limits on
RAMFS. His original patch for 2.4.19-rc1-ac2 as well as my update for
2.4.32 is available here, in case you're interested in porting it to 2.6 :

This is very hard to maintain, that's why I include the patch above in
my kernels ;-)
