My main concern is that we cannot get the .o file with this approach, I
am particulary concerned about this approach when processing vmlinux.
Static function names are duplicated in the kernel.  Reporting a
dangling reference to init or discarded data by function name rather
than by object will lead to confusion if the reference is from one of
the duplicate function names.
# nm vmlinux | fgrep ' t ' | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -dc
produces this horrible list of duplicate function names (IA64):

It will also be extremely difficult to track down entries from compiler
generated anonymous data areas.  They are hard enough to isolate when
looking at a single object.  When all the anonymous data has been
merged together in vmlinux, it will be beyond most people.
