That even might be better, if there's less code merged as a result.

Well, where's it stated that you have to develop new code for each merge
window?  By making shorter merge windows with less code merged in each of
them, we could actaully improve things.

Exactly.

That depends on the amount of bugs introduced during the merge window.  With
shorter merge windows we may introduce fewer bugs per merge window and
the most subtle ones take more six weeks to find anyway.

Well, that's assuming that people test linux-next and -mm etc., but frankly I'm
not seeing that happening.  Hopefully, things are going to improve.
