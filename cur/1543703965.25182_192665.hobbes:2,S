I agree we should have a separe signal for CPU Hotplug. By default the signal 
will be ignored, unless a task registers a signal handler for that special 
signal.
That way, tasks which "knowingly" change their CPU affinity will be able to 
tackle a CPU going down by handling the signal (probably change their CPU 
affinity again), while tasks which have their CPU affinity changed "unknowingly"
(by other tasks) will just ignore the signal. The hotplug script interface
allows the admin to go and change the CPU affinity again for the second class 
of tasks, if needed.
The only problem with a new signal is conformance to standards (if any).
