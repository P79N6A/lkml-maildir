Oh that's a bug.  It is allowed to modify the dma_length field but not
the physical length field.
I imagine x86_64 is doing this so that there need not be a seperate dma_length
field in the scatter_gather struct defined for that platform, and that's too bad it will
definitely need such a seperate field if it wants to implement coalescing.
