This is actually true, but as other block device drivers create the
LUN (or the equivalent thereof), the request queue, and the block device
at the same time or under control of the driver itself they don't have
this problem.
It's only due to the decoupling of the block driver from the underlying
device (ie sd driver and scsi_device) when this problem arises.

And should be okay as the device isn't accessible from userland
anyway after doing a device_del(). And the implication is that it's
going to be remove soon entirely. So we're just moving the timing
of the eventual call to the ->release() function; the events will
be triggered by device_del() and won't be changed.
And if some device actually requires a reference to the parent
during ->release() it can as well acquire it manually and shouldn't
rely on the core logic to do that automatically.
Cheers,
Hannes
