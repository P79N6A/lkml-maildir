Ok, I guess I was unclear.  You would set up some number of threads, lets say
2x where x is the number of cpus.  Then you multiplex the connections on these
threads using standard "select" system call.  In this case, you have a fixed
number of threads, but a variable number of connections.
But the point remains, that you are not doing a huge number of clones all the
time.
