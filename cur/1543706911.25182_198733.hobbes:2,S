Note that isofs_fill_super() calls sb_bread() before setting the blocksize.
For this it is relying on blockdev.bd_block_size being set up
appropriately.
Which all tends to imply that the underlying queue's ->hardsect_size is
very wrong.
The code which is responsible for setting up the queue's hardsect_size
appears to live in cdrom_read_toc():
	/* Check to see if the existing data is still valid.
	   If it is, just return. */
	(void) cdrom_check_status(drive, sense);
	if (CDROM_STATE_FLAGS(drive)->toc_valid)
		return 0;
	/* Try to get the total cdrom capacity and sector size. */
	stat = cdrom_read_capacity(drive, &toc->capacity, &sectors_per_frame,
				   sense);
	if (stat)
		toc->capacity = 0x1fffff;
	set_capacity(drive->disk, toc->capacity * sectors_per_frame);
	blk_queue_hardsect_size(drive->queue,
				sectors_per_frame << SECTOR_BITS);
I'm wondering about that `return 0;' in there.  That will return "success"
even though we haven't set up half the things which should have been set
up.
Jens, should we be returning some sort of error code there?
