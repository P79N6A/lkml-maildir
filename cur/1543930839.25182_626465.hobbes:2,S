X86_FEATURE_CONSTANT_TSC CPUs (all modern Intel CPUs) should be fine - 
we dont do any TSC frequency fixups for them. The loops_per_jiffy fixup 
looks like this:
                if (!(freq->flags & CPUFREQ_CONST_LOOPS))
                        cpu_data(freq->cpu).loops_per_jiffy =
                                cpufreq_scale(loops_per_jiffy_ref,
                                                ref_freq, freq->new);
i.e. X86_FEATURE_CONSTANT_TSC excluded. The sched_clock() scaling factor 
is modified like this:
                        if (!(freq->flags & CPUFREQ_CONST_LOOPS)) {
                                tsc_khz = cpu_khz;
                                preempt_disable();
                                set_cyc2ns_scale(cpu_khz, smp_processor_id());
so here X86_FEATURE_CONSTANT_TSC is excluded again. So the whole 
frequency scaling issue will become a pure legacy issue only with time.
