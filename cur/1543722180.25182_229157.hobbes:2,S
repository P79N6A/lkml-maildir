You can do this without any changes:
     if [ -d /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include2 ]; then
       kerndir=`cd  /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include2/asm; cd -P../..;/bin/pwd`
     else
       kerndir=`cd /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build; /bin/pwd`
    fi
But can the include2/asm symlink be made a relative one, please?  I frequently
build on one machine, then NFS-mount the build tree and run make
modules_install somewhere else; I always at present have to convert
that link to a relative symlink before doing so.
