OK. Let's leave aside the issue for a second of whether ZONE_DMA should
be configurable or not (ie your patch), and just worry about how this
works in practice going forwards in the short term. Don't get me wrong,
I'd love to kill ZONE_DMA, or at least the 16MB way it's implemented in
i386 right now.
I presume the fallback order for everything is still
HIGHMEM -> NORMAL -> DMA, and nobody is proposing changing that.
(ignoring DMA32 to keep thing simpler).
If a device driver wants "DMAable" memory, and thus does a ZONE_DMA 
allocation, and we've moved all its memory from ZONE_DMA to ZONE_NORMAL
(as I think you're proposing doing for PPC64 (and ia64?)), then the
allocation will fail.
So are we saying that no driver code should be calling with GFP_DMA
(a quick grep turns up 148 instances under driver/), that if they do
they should only work on specific architectures (some instances were
s390-only drivers)? If so, should we not be removing the definiton of
GFP_DMA itself if ZONE_DMA is config'ed out, so that it fails at
compile time, rather than runtime?

Glad we're agreed on that, at least.
