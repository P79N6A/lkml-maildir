Yes, all non-kprobe breakpoints are left to the kernel to be handled.
The objective here is to intercept the trap handling of a certain
category of such breakpoints and emit a warning. The premise being
that .kprobes.text section is a logical breakpoint-free zone.

By a simple modification of is_jprobe_bkpt() (defined in patch #2 of
this series).

Could you clarirfy this with some example. For now I'm assuming that
by external probe frameworks you mean kernel modules using kprobes. If
they embed breakpoints in their handlers, then they will simply not be
caught by this check because thay cannot lie in the .kprobes.text
section.

I would image that from a code correctness's point of view it
shouldn't matter. In any case, nothing can be done if the kprobe
exception notifier is circumvented.
