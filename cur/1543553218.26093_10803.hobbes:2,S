Speaking only for myself: on the technical side I don't think you can't be much
faster than moving the performance critical services into the kernel and by
skipping the copies (infact I also think that for fileserving skipping the
copies and making sendfile to work and to work in zero copy will be enough).
So I don't think losing robusteness this way can be explained in any technical
way and no, it's not by showing me money that you'll convince me that's a good
idea.
