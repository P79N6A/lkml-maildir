Almost. The Time Stamp Counter (inside the CPU) works with a constant
frequency, but only at e.g. each eigth tick the other parts of the CPU do
some work.

Not necessarily. It's not really every eigth tick where work is done, but
more like 800 ticks where work is done, then 5600 ticks pause, and so on --
the frequency is somewhere in the docs, I forgot the exact value... So I'm
not 100% convinced the measurements you've done do show something broken.

It should, something _is_ broken in this regard [and I'm working on it, just
had sent a RFC to the cpufreq mailing list...]. Maybe this causes some
strangeness, especially if you run a userspace cpufreq tool -- but maybe the
p4-clockmod hardware is even more strange than I thought it to be, and is
per _virtual_ CPU.
Can you please apply the latest cpufreq snapshot from
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/bitkeeper/cpufreq/
, then the attached patch, and switch the CPU frequencies of both (virtual)
CPUs around a bit, and after each switch, 
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq
and check whether the values are the same you wrote into the specific CPU's
scaling_setspeed [if using the userspace governor] file?
Many thanks,
	Dominik
