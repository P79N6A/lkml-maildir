	cn_netlink_send() performs an skb_alloc() and I wanted to avoid doing
two allocations that might sleep. 
	On a 32-bit machine the buffer should be around 42 bytes, making the
function locals around 50 bytes. On a 64-bit machine I believe this
should be around 58 bytes. Is this generally considered to be too large?
These functions are called from:
fork:
-> do_fork -> copy_process -> proc_fork_connector -> ...
-> fork_idle (this holds a struct ptregs) -> copy_process ->
proc_fork_connector -> ...
exec:
-> do_execve -> search_binary_handler -> proc_exec_connector -> ...
id:
-> sys_set(r|e|s|fs)?[ug]id -> proc_id_connector -> ...
exit:
-> do_exit -> proc_exit_connector -> ...
	Where "-> ..." signifies a call to cn_netlink_send(). So they should
only be a problem if a caller or cn_netlink_send() use too much stack
space.
