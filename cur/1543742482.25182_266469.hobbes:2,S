The change was that from 2.6.8 to 2.6.9 the rlimit for memlock was
changed from infinity to 32k (and at the same time, normal users are now
allowed to use mlockall if they dont have alot of memory to mlock).  I
fixed up the openais code by doing something evil from uid 0 like:
       struct rlimit rlimit;
        rlimit.rlim_cur = RLIM_INFINITY;
        rlimit.rlim_max = RLIM_INFINITY;
        setrlimit (RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, &rlimit);
Thanks
