Well, IBM is using it in a large project, the involved people are in CC.
Thomas has 3+ customers who use it, I've added him to CC.
I'm working for Nokia now and we use it. We also develop a new file
system on top of UBI and Nokia invests money in it. So UBI is going to
be maintained.
Also there was enough questions interest in the MTD mailing lists as
well. Particularly, a guy from @sunsung.com was interested.
P.S. Just for the reference, here is the URL of the new file-system
development tree (we have just started):
git://git.infradead.org/~dedekind/jffs3-2.6.git
or gitweb
