Yes, I thought it might be a little heavy-handed, but I figured, if it's
good enough for statfs...  Also, the values in "ipcs -m -l"
(1) come from IPC_INFO shmctl (separate from SHM_INFO) and
(2) are also available in /proc/sys/kernel (except for shmmin, which is
constant anyway).
On a tangential issue, I think it would be nice if an app could get the
actual values it wants, rather than just know that they are unreliable.
With statfs, that's possible thanks to the existence of statfs64, which
is 64-bit wide even in 32-bit world.
With {shm,sem,msg}ctl, we do have struct shminfo64 etc., but I'm not
sure why they exist at all, as they seem always to have the same bitness
as the default structures.
On the other hand, sys_shmctl() has forever had a comment about replacing
it with a /proc interface.  This has been done for {SHM,SEM,MSG}_STAT calls
(/proc/sysvipc/{shm,sem,msg}), but not for {IPC,SHM,SEM,MSG}_INFO calls.
Some of the *_INFO values are exposed in /proc, but only the sysctl-able
ones.
So I'm writing a patch to create /proc/sysvipc/{shm,sem,msg}info.  This
will allow ipcs and anyone else to access the values using a
bitness-agnostic
interface.  (But exactly because these values aren't that important, I'm
afraid no one may care enough to apply it.)
