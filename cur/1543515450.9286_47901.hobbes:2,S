sorry for replying to myself and swamping the list with my mails, but I
think I found the cause of the lockup.
It apparently was not ISDN, but netfilter 0.1.12. After disabling a script
that loads the netfilter modules, the pc didn't crash any more. Actually,
I'm running 2.3.26 right now - works like a charm ;-)
It would be great if anybody could give me some advice on how to track the
bug down, since I'm not very experienced in doing this. I haven't had any
problems before, so...
Reg.,
  Jonas
