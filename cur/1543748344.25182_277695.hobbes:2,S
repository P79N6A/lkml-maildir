Take a look at the adjtimex man page as well as the ntp.c file from the
timeofday core patch. There are number of different types of adjustments
that are made, possibly at the same time. Briefly, they are (to my
understanding - I'm going off my notes from awhile ago): 
o tick adjustments
	how much time should pass in a _user_ tick
o frequency adjustments
	long term adjustment to correct for constant drift), 
o offset adjustments
	additional ppm adjustment to correct for current offset from the ntp
server
o single shot offset adjustments 
	old style adjtime functionality
Tick, frequency and offset adjustments can be precalculated and summed
to a single ppm adjustment. This is similar to the style of adjustment
you propose directly onto the time source frequency values. 
However, there is also this short term single shot adjustments. These
adjustments are made by applying the MAX_SINGLESHOT_ADJ (500ppm) scaling
for an amount of time (offset_len) which would compensate for the
offset. This style is difficult because we cannot precompute it and
apply it to an entire tick. Instead it needs to be applied for just a
specific amount of time which may be only a fraction of a tick. When we
start talking about systems with irregular tick frequency (via
virtualization, or tickless systems) it becomes even more problematic. 
If this can be fudged then it becomes less of an issue. Or at worse, we
have to do two mult/shift operations on two "parts" of the time interval
using different adjustments.
Its starting to look doable, but its not necessarily the simplest thing
(for me at least). I'll put it on my list, but patches would be more
then welcome. 
thanks
