Documentation.  ISO rules aside, explicitly initializing what you will
be relying on to be initialized is a good way to make your code more
readable.  It says "I may not intend to initialize this at runtime."

My opinion on that matter is that gas should be taught about the
we-plan-to-zero-bss-anyway optimization.  (As an option flag, perhaps.)
That way we can keep the initializers and gas will ignore whichever
ones happen to be zeroes.

I haven't tried your patch, but considering what gzip does to long
strings of nulls, I have to ask: are you talking about vmlinux or
zImage?
