I don't think so, but I obviously have no way of actually confirming my
suspicion.
If the stat information was wrong due to the partial image, the lookup
should still have succeeded (the directory entries certainly were there -
otherwise they'd not have shown up in readdir), and we would just have
gotten garbage inode information etc. I think.
