The only PCI transaction that requires the cache line size to be correctly
configured is PCI WRITE and INVALIDATE. This transaction may be used by
the 875 only for data read from a SCSI device and DMAed to memory.
Note that the controller may use optimized PCI transactions only if the 
cache line size is configured in its PCI device configuration space.
Otherwise only normal PCI memory read and PCI memory write transactions 
will be used.
Could you check if the cache line size is configured for your 875?
Let me imagine it is so. Btw, I may be wasting my time if it is not ...
Then the 875 may also use PCI read multiple transactions and/or PCI read
line transactions when reading data from memory. If the corruption is due
to the use of these transactions, the the PCI-HOST bridges may well be the
culprit, in my opinion.
Anyway, since the sym53c8xx driver does not try to change the configured
cache line size on PPC, I would suggest to try again the same tests with
the cache line size set to zero for the 875. You may hack the driver code
or the PPC pci code if needed, for example, for value zero to be written
in the proper place in the PCI configuration space of the 875.
