	I found that this is happneing due to a conflict of intertests.
	Ping/Telnet/ect.. do not appear to trust the named reponse
	comming from port 54 since the original destination was port
	53.  Thusly they return an icmp udp port unreachable in return.
	I would "think" ( yes I bet you can smell the smoke too ) that
	the reason for this lack of trust in the response would be 
	related to DNS Spoofing or some such.  Anyway.  
	I think I said this in another reply, but for the sake of this
	one beeing shorter I would say that I would have throught the
	transparent proxy support would have made the port redirection
	transparent to the remote and local application.
	Thusly I would reccomend that apon handling a redirection on
	the input I would think the output of that port would need to
	be translated in some way to perform a trully transparent 
	feature.
