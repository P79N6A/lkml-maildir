By goal with the b_state bit was to change this:
bread
submit_bh
__get_request_wait (unplugs just to get a free rq)
wait_on_buffer (run tq_disk)
Into this:
bread
set BH_Sync
submit_bh
__make_request (get a reserved sync request, unplugs to start the read)
buffer up to date
It's wishful thinking, since the unplug doesn't mean we end up with an
unlocked buffer.  But at the very least, taking a reserved sync request
and unplugging right away shouldn't be worse than the current method of
unplugging just to get a request.  
And on boxes with lots of busy drives, avoiding tq_disk is a good thing,
even if we only manage to avoid it for a small percentage of the reads.
