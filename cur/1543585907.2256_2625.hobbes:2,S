Not really the platform, but the architecture, from a C/C++ compiler and 
kernel/asm/lowlevel lang development standpoint

the limited number of registers (3 bits allocated, IIRC) which limits 
the number to 8 minus CS,DS,IP; meaning only 5 GPRs, the requirement of 
an (antiquated) BIOS (design), 16-bit bootstrap

If not lots of GPRs, but at least enough to be able to allocate sanely.

Yes, I just didn't feel like listing all arch's. Plus, (ducks) the MIPS 
is no longer supported by Windoze, and I rarely see any discussion on lk 
about this arch, and I forgot about Alpha for a minute.
I admit that I likely look like an idiot right now, and I am not 
intending to insult anyone, just curious about this.
