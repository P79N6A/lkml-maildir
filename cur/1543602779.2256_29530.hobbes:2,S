  Like Ingo says, most of modern distributions begin to work with
  O_LARGEFILE  properly, but still some utilities fail it.
  Your older backup application program may fail it too.
  The solution could be as simple as piping the backup material
  into another program, which then pipes it out, e.g.:
	'|dd bs=1M of=/backups/fileNNN'
