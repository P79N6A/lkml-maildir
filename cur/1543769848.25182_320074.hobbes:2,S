Perhaps not in this case.
If I read it correctly rbind is a copy of the mount tree. It leaves behind 
the original. A move operation appears to copy the tree and then 
basically umounts the source tree.
For autofs the originating mount point is owned and controled by the 
userspace daemon and the corresponding automount map specifies what may be 
mounted. We can't just umount it without cooperation from the daemon.

And assigns the same super block and root dentry.
The problem is that when an autofs dentry is walked on it sends a message 
to the userspace daemon. The daemon performs the corresponding mount, in 
the source filesystem, causing a mount to appear in the destination 
filesystem as well, but without the correct vfsmount linkages.

An autofs4 filesystem is intimately tied to some userspace program. For me 
it's the automount daemon and the automount map defining the mountpounts 
it knows about.
This is the source of the difficulty in defining the way it should behave.
