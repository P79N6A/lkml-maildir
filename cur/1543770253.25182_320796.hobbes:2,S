Greetings;
Just now, trying to build 2.6.12-rc5, I'm getting this:
  CC      drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_devintf.o
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_devintf.c: In function `ipmi_new_smi':

This is new, rc4 is running fairly well.  I thought my .config
had become contaminated, but the IPMI stuff looks ok:
[root@coyote linux-2.6.12-rc5]# grep IPMI .config
# IPMI
CONFIG_IPMI_HANDLER=y
# CONFIG_IPMI_PANIC_EVENT is not set
CONFIG_IPMI_DEVICE_INTERFACE=y
# CONFIG_IPMI_SI is not set
# CONFIG_IPMI_WATCHDOG is not set
# CONFIG_IPMI_POWEROFF is not set
???
