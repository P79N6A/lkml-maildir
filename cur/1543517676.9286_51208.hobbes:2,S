Hello,
After 2.3.29 kernel compilation (which didn't yell any error / warning
during syncppp.c module compilation), I can't load the syncppp module:
# modprobe syncppp
/lib/modules/2.3.29/misc/syncppp.o: unresolved symbol inetdev_lock
#
I did some investigation, and the most I could find was that inetdev_lock
is declared in <linux/inetdevice.h> as extern, and the only place where
there is an inetdev_lock variable declaration is in
linux/net/ipv4/devinet.c .
Could somebody help please ?? :)
Regards,
Ivan
