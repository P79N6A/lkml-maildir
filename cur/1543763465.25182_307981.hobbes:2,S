Right. I think maybe I've made some kind of stupid mistake. Sorry.
I looked, and looked again, and just couldn't find anything wrong with 
the module (so it must be the kernel, right?), but I looked the wrong 
place, of course. It was the build flags, not the source code...

It seems like this is not quite right. I've now changed this build flags 
based on the module build setup of the kernel sources, so that I have
gcc    -DLinux -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -fno-unit-at-a-time 
-march=i686 -mregparm=3  -I../../include -fno-strict-aliasing 
-fno-common -ffreestanding -fomit-frame-pointer -nostdinc -I. 
-I/lib/modules/2.6.11.4-0.EL.toralf/build/include -isystem 
/usr/lib/gcc/i386-redhat-linux/3.4.3/include -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE 
-I/lib/modules/2.6.11.4-0.EL.toralf/build/include/asm-i386/mach-default 
-o itifg8.mod.o -c itifg8.mod.c
and the module works!
I'm not sure what exactly did the trick, though. (Although I guess the 
distinction between -march and just -mcpu might be significant.). If 
someone would like to explain more about the different flags, just go 
ahead....
