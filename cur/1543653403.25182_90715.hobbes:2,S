And the other 400 megabytes will be freed up on demand.

No...  If that were so, you'd never be able to start any
applications.

Well, maybe Oracle is failing to start.  But maybe that's
not for the reasons you are assuming.

If Oracle requests 800 megabytes from the kernel, it will get it.
It won't be able to mlock it (I'm guessing here).

Yup, the "shared" accounting is always zero.  Maybe we should
fix that, or remove it.

Please ensure that the failure is not some Oracle-specific setup
thing, and then provide specific details on the problem which you
are observing.  The assumptions which you are making may not be
correct.
Thanks.
