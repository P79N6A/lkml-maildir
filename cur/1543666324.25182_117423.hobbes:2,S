No flames intended - I just have different requirements than you do,
and suspending hasn't been an issue for me, and I've not bothered
trying to get it to work.
I've seen a workaround posted for the nvidia suspend issue - the trick was to
configure a suspend script that apmd/whatever would call, and include
a '/usr/bin/chvt 1' in it.  So on the way down, it would change off the
nvidia-controlled VT, and all would be well.

Oh, the free driver has "supported" the card for ages.  My point was that (a)
the free driver isn't 2-d accelerated as much as the NVidia driver (the 'nv'
free driver can average 10-15% CPU by itself, and the 'nvidia' closed driver
only 1-2% while feeling much quicker), and (b) the NVidia driver "just works"
in finding the video port on the docking station when I'm docked - the 'nv'
free drivers would find the LCD screen fine and not find the docking port
video.
