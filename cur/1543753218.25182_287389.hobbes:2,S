These are great, but I don't think such tools could cover all issues,
especially in the kernel (where hardware is a factor).  Perhaps by
hammering a function with every input possible, but eh.
Humans create the tools, humans create the flaws.  Thus, humans create
flaws in the tools.  Humans of course aren't staticly flawed (as the
tools will be), so they or other humans can notice bugs they missed before.

"Read" and "Audit" are two different things.  I can read a changeset and
see that a[10] got a 20 character string into it; I will NOT see that a
particular execution path 17 function calls long under one obscure but
possible and deliberately activatable condition causes memory corruption.
I thought the purpose of an audit was to sit down and give the code
several long, hard looks from different perspectives; though I've never
done one (I hope to in the future), so I wouldn't know would I?
Maybe I should stop talking before I make myself look stupider...
