Me too, actually. I did it this way because I don't want to deviate from
the old code too much. Since all sparc32 drivers are either linked to
sbuslib.c or has their own fb_mmap method, the above test is redundant. 
I'll leave the decision to remove the above test to David Miller.

This one is a tad bit more complicated, so I'll leave the present setup
for now. Once the arch-specific parts are properly separated, maybe I'll
take that step.

Any suggestion for a name? io_pgprotect() perhaps?
