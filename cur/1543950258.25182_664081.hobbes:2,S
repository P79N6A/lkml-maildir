I will be sure to hunt you down to help debug when someone reports
that once every few weeks their multi-day simulation gives incorrect
results :-)
This is one of those cases where the bug is going to be a huge
issue to people who actually hit it, and since we know about the
problem, knowingly shipping something in that state is unforgivable.
