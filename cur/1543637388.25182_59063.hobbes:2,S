It will, but we will check need_resched twice.  And preempt_count
again.  My original version just did the "unlock; lock" combo and thus
the checking was automatic... but if we want to check before we unlock,
we might as well be optimal about it.

I hope it compiles to nothing!  There is a false in an if... oh, wait,
to preserve possible side-effects gcc will keep the need_resched() call
so I guess we should reorder it as:
	if (preempt_count() == 1 && need_resched())
Then we get "if (0 && ..)" which should hopefully be evaluated away. 
Then the inline is empty and nothing need be done.
