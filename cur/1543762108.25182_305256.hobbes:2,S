Great!  While I think BitKeeper is useful, you are more than welcome to 
continue sending patches.
To wireless developers, BitKeeper will mainly be of use in sync'ing with 
the latest wireless-2.6 tree.

Well, all this sounds good to me.  See also the 'status' post I just 
made, and the 'note on wireless development process' I am about to write.
I'm really hoping someone will look into integrating wireless 802.11 as 
a "real" protocol, rather than faking ethernet.  This work starts with 
the "p80211" template DaveM provided, and hopefully continues with 
Vladimir's updates of DaveM's code (did he post those anywhere?).  There 
are also issues such as ARP types that Dan Williams mentioned to me as 
issues.
The "integrate wireless into net stack" work requires a very 
self-motivated person who is willing to poke into the net stack, and 
answer their own questions.
