Subject: 2.5.30 unresolved symbol: elv_queue_empty
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The subject says nearly all: with 2.5.30, I get the following:
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.5.30/kernel/drivers/block/floppy.o
depmod:         elv_queue_empty
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.5.30/kernel/drivers/ide/atapi.o
depmod:         elv_queue_empty
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.5.30/kernel/drivers/ide/ide-mod.o
depmod:         elv_queue_empty
Oh, while I'm at it: ever since the IDE cleanup started, loading one
or more of the IDE/CD related modules for a second time after they 
have been unloaded once already results in a pretty bad oops (total
lockup). Took me quite a while to narrow this down. 2.5.29 still has 
this problem. I was going to submit the oops for 2.5.30 if applicable, 
but first gotta get that symbol resolved...
This is on a measly SMP P5 with limited memory which is all-SCSI 
except for the CD drive. Hence the modules.
Regards,
  MCE
