Raman,
The original bug #8198 was resolved, but that doesn't mean that a new bug can't appear with the
same symptom. I was unable to reproduce the bug in the 2.6.22.9 kernel, but if you can then I
would alert Tejun Heo or Greg Kroah-Hartman. (Tejun said that he thought my second bug looked like
a module-reference counting problem.)
Cheers,
Chris
