Cary, also note that Andrew did some work with ext3 which can greatly
improve the performance of synchronous I/O.  Granted, it doesn't fix
any performance issues in the VM or VFS that may have been introduced,
but if you are looking for good benchmark numbers, give ext3 a try.
Use a large journal to avoid journal flushes for sync I/O.  See:
