Linus implied there would be one more last minute surge of merges.  (Why else 
have people patch hoovering for anything other than bugs in the meantime?)
Probably the best thing to do is assemble a list of candidates, well-tested 
patches that have been up on the list and with as many endorsements from 
testers going "AOL!" as possible.  The last go-through when lkinus gets back 
is probably going to be simple thumbs-up thumbs down on each entry in the 
pending feature list, and then into the 3.0-pre series...
The current "pending feature list" would probably be here:
http://kernelnewbies.org/status/
Specifically:
o in -ac PCMCIA Zoom video support (Alan Cox) 
o in -ac Device mapper for Logical Volume Manager (LVM2)  (LVM2 team) 
o in -mm VM large page support  (Many people) 
o in -mm  Page table sharing  (Daniel Phillips, Dave McCracken) 
o Ready  Build option for Linux Trace Toolkit (LTT) (Karim Yaghmour) 
o Ready Dynamic Probes (dprobes team) 
o Ready Zerocopy NFS (Hirokazu Takahashi) 
o Ready High resolution timers (George Anzinger, etc.) 
o Ready EVMS (Enterprise Volume Management System) (EVMS team) 
o Ready Linux Kernel Crash Dumps (Matt Robinson, LKCD team) 
o Ready Rewrite of the console layer (James Simmons) 
If you're not on this list, contact Guillaume, or start your own list of 
"final merge candidates"...
