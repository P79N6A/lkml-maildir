The other case which has been claimed is to set the mount/fsck timestamps
on the filesystems at boot, but it is mostly a special case, ie,
1. kernel boots (RTC is non-UTC) and has no idea of the timezone
2. root filesystem is monted read-only
(2.5). run fsck on / (this is the catch, see below)
3. hwclock is run from the boot scripts, kernel now knows correct time
4. remount / rw
5. mount/fsck/etc proceed as usual with the right time.
Now if the root filesystem is corrupted, then after fsck is run, time will
probably be messed up in it, but that is an abnormal condition.  The other
posibility is to run hwclock before fsck, but that is not safe.  If you
have everything in a single partition then that's another story ;-)
IMHO, a simple command parameter giving the offset in hours (half-hours?) 
from UTC to the kernel is fine, but I really hope nobody is considering
adding daylight savings, leap seconds, and all that userland craziness to
the kernel 8)
