Meanwhile I've found the source of the problem. A simple change in
drivers/char/pc_keyb.c
line 73 did the trick.
- #define kbd_controller_present()        1
+ #define kbd_controller_present()        0
The only backdraw I've noticed so far is the problem that the kernel
won't work on servers with a ps/2 keyboard controller anymore (of
course) properly. But that's a minor issue.
We are still running 2.4 kernels because our application is incompatible
with the new thread library. A migration is already planned but that
takes time, alot of. I don't expect a migration to take place before the
end of the year, maybe even later.
