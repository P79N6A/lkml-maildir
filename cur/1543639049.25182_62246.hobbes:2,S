I don't see why it is unmaintainable. What is so bad with these ifs? 
64bit cleanness is just another dependency, nothing magic and fundamentally
hard.
I admit it is a bit ugly to hardcode CONFIG_X86_64 here, I would actually
prefer an generic CONFIG_64BIT
At least for i386 it should make no difference at all.
If you object to the ifdefs I can turn it into 
dep_tristate  ... $CONFIG_X86_32 (or CONFIG_I386 and add this)
(unfortunately there is no dep_tristate ... !$CONFIG_64BIT) 
Alternatively CONFIG_NO_64BIT to work around this issue.

The main reason I'm doing this is that unlike IA64,alpha,mips (sorry no
offense to these ports) x86-64 is aimed at the mass market. I will
not invoke the A..T... word, but having a configuration where a good
chunk of the drivers do not work is just not acceptable for x86-64 where
even non kernel hackers will likely recompile the kernels. I tried
to fix it for some of the drivers but some are obviously hopeless without
major work.

I don't think it is very nice. Some of these actually compile, just with
thousands of warnings, but will oops very quickly likely after first load.
I prefer to disable them. That is much nicer to the user.
