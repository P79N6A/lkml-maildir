PPP uses a variant of zlib with some extensions.  I believe that I
didn't break zlib for normal use when I added the extensions but I
would have to check that to be 100% sure.  The PPP zlib.c is based on
zlib-1.0.4, which is no longer the most recent version.
I think it would be possible to make PPP use the standard zlib but
with decreased performance.  It's a long time since I looked at that
stuff though.

No, the module name is "ppp_deflate".
