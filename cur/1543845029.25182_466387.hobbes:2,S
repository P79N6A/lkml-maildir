Andrew, 
With apologies to Roman, I'm withdrawing my hesitation on these patches.
I was able to run tests for two days each w/ and w/o the patch I had
concerns about. And indeed, it seems if the drift file is reset, the
initial convergence is much slower (and this is really what worried me).
However once it converges it seems to keep sync as well as the current
code.
thanks
