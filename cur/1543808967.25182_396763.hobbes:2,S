I'm referring to the follwing, from man mlock(2):
"Cryptographic  security  software often handles critical bytes like passwords
or secret keys as data structures. As a result of paging, these secrets could
be  transfered  onto  a persistent swap store medium, where they might be
accessible to the enemy long after the security  software  has erased the
secrets in RAM and terminated."
