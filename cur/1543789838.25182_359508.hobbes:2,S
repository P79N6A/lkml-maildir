	Kexec support involves kernel level support per architecture and 
a user space kexec-tools.
	Generic kexec kernel support for ppc (ppc32/GameCube) was added 
sometime back by Albert Herranz, and I think they got included in 2.6.10-mm1 
as per:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.10/2.6.10-mm1/broken-out/
	 Albert's code was also posted on this site:
http://www.gc-linux.org/down/isobel/kexec/
	ppc64 kexec kernel support was added recently (2.6.12-rc4-mm1)
	Eric's site can be used for downloading the kexec-tools.
	You may want to cross post kexec discussion mails to fastboot@osdl.org,
as that is the primary list where all kexec discussions happen.
Hope this helps
Thanks and Regards,
Sharada
