I have considered that option too. It is a good place for a quick
start but it is not maintainable in the long run. The driver code has
to be divorced from X and not require having the entire X system
around to build a new driver.
Have you checked the dependencies needed for loading X drivers?
Modularization may have helped but loading an X driver used to
effectively suck in the entire X server due to dependencies. Sucking
in all of X is not fair to alternative windowing systems.
I do agree that this is a workable starting point but it can't be the
long term solution.
