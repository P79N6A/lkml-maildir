Well I'm not talking about dumbing-down the kernel. What I'm talking about
is to keep existing functionality.
For sure the kernel is made for people with a clue, but still people
with a clue sometimes makes stupid mistakes.
A build system that catches obvious stupid mistakes is IMHO a good thing.
But it shall not that for any cost, and the normal incremental build
shall continue to be as fast as possible.
