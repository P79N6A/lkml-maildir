Yes, it is ignoring Athlon because my patch is basically just clean up and not changing
anything.
If you read the 2.5.45, you will see *2.5.45* is also ignoring Athlon and not using 
unrolled copies.
I am working on optimized version for AMD, go over on this patch.
But thank you for your comment, I will consider using CONFIG_SMALL for 
putting all the old stuff in it.
