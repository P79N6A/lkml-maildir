As I wrote in some earlier mail, I'm probably the first one ever
who tried it on ARM: When I tried first, tracing didn't work at all,
because the trace timing macro's were not defined (at least for
sa1100). I quick-hacked the three missing macros (this caused the
tracer to produce at least some output) without checking if 
anything else is missing.
