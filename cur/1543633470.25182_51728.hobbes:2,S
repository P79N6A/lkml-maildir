A-prog:               B-prog:
gets write lock
write some data
                        block on read lock
write some data
crashes
                        wants an error indication to repair data magically
So a crashing A-prog is OK for you, but B should get an indication.
Could catch a signal (SIGLOST?) returning -1 with errno=LOCKBROKEN
That would be possible with futex.
That is a case for writing data to a file - what about linked lists
in memory?
