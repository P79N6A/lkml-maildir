great. I can try the hundred-win2k-vm test on linux some day and
see what happen.

In my experiment, if some bigmm get killed by oom killer.

We told them to dump the ram file at /dev/shm and prepare a large
swap space. And be gentle to linux, don't push vm's total ram
beyond what is on the machine. It is running OK so far.
We did try to recomment some SuSE or Redhat new kernel. It did not
work at that time. But I am not surprised at all, it is something
like 2.4.7 based. We have this problem on linux for some time now.

Patch kernel and ask them to build kernel is not an option at all.
They just want something reliable. They trust most major linux
distribution's kenrel just don't home make one.

That I don't know.
