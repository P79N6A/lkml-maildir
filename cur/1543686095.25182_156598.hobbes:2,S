I do think there is room for having some sane default settings to be
used when an unconfigured bridge is detected.  For most of the TI
bridges, there is only one reasonable default for how to enable PCI
interrupt delivery.  The important part here is "unconfigured bridge":
never fool with interrupt delivery on a bridge that has been set up
by the BIOS, which covers essentially all laptops.
