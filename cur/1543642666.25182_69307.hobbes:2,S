Yes, you did. But that is too confusing with find_inode and friends IMHO 
and lookups are often termed _lookup and not _find, e.g. 
radix_tree_lookup(), simple_lookup(), d_lookup(), path_lookup(), 
cached_lookup()...
Whereas there is not a single function in fs/ or mm/ ending in _find... 
They are all called find_blah and find_inode already exists... Having both 
find_inode and inode_find aka ifind seems weird, at least to me...
There was another suggestion on #kernel and that was to do:
s/ilookup/ilookup_fast/
s/ilookup5/ilookup/
But if we do that we might as well carry on and also do:
s/iget_locked/iget_locked_fast/
s/iget5_locked/iget_locked/
And another one was:
s/ilookup5/ilookup_hash/
and by extension / for consistency one could add:
s/iget5_locked/iget_hash_locked/
s/find_inode/find_inode_hash/
s/find_inode_fast/find_inode/
s/get_new_inode_fast/get_new_inode/
s/get_new_inode/get_new_inode_hash/
How about those? I still like ilookup at the beginning, or inode_lookup...
Best regards,
