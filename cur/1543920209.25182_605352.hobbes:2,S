Bryan, I'm very interested in the technical advantage of using a completion
here.
In my _not-experienced_ opinion, I remember completions was created mainly for
"create_task, wait till task got finished, go on" case. Why using it in a
different context while workqueues was created for a similar situation to
ad7142 one (non-irq context bottom-half) ?
