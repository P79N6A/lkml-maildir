 And "m" is presumably described in details elsewhere as the semantics is 
common for all instructions involving address calculation.  There is no 
point in repeating the lengthy explanation for every instruction, is it?  
Or would you prefer having each possible register and/or value of constant 
arguments described for every instruction separately?
