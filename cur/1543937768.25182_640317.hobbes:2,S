ioctl() is the universal Unix mechanism for control of drivers
(modules). open(), close(), read(), write(), mmap() are the other
common methods. Some drivers may use sockets for communications.
I such a case, you use setsockopt() to change things.
Drivers can signal user-space processes as well. Such programs
use select() and poll().
