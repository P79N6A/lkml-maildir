Unselected.
Now, I have this kernel panic:
###################
#VFS: cannot open root device "sda3" or unknown-block (0,0)
#Please, append a correct "root=" boot option; here are the available 
#partitions:
#1600 4194302 hdc driver: ide-cdrom
#Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on
