Why do you need emul_prefix in the first place ? You need a different
/lib for emulated binaries then use all the nice stuff Al has done
and mount yourself a file system that is in your namespace but not
the global one.
If you want to do overlaying then lets get the union fs for read only
stuff into the kernel properly and solve the -real- problem not hack
up some emulator magic again.
