According to the XFree86 web pages - they have a LOT of corporate
sponsors contributing both money, jobs, and equipment. They do get paid
back by being able to generate custom graphics interfaces for their hardware.

Possibly - though the ones I did look at were referring to X windows (note the 
phrase IS quoted, and treated as one phrase, not two independant words).
On another job site I got 291 responses for UNIX OR LINUX, and most of those
had both entries, and several with GUI requirements. (The Tivoli port 
positions looked most interesting)

I don't think Open Office itself has funding, other than that provided by the 
web site. It inherits updates from StarOffice, and vice versa. Now that
RH (and other) distributions are including OpenOffice and/or StarOffice, I do 
think that funding will increase - there is now a market demand.

Nothing - development goes on in the free version.
And actually, sun didn't loose 2 billions... (they didn't have it to start 
with). What they gained was a LOT of converts that now want StarOffice, if
they want active support.
