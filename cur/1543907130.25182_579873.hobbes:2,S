Drivers may care about the block size though so you can't have it
changing behind their backs. e.g., they may need to pad data to a
multiple of the block size.

sdio_set_block_size(func, 64); /* ew, this card is fussy */
download_firmware();
sdio_set_block_size(func, func->max_blksize); /* Ahhh, back to the
card's default */
If a card is fussy about the block size I don't think there's anything
cleaner than specifying directly in the driver.
