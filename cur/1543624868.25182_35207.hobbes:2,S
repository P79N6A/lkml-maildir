I always check out my trees with "bk -r co -q" precisely because of 
command-line completion.  Anything that saves my poor hands from further 
pain is a good thing... :)  And similar to your example, I switched from 
my preferred method of search, grep -r, to /usr/bin/find, just so I 
would (and had to) add "grep -v SCCS" in the middle of the xargs pipe.
