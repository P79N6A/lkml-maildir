(Good mailing list practices ask you not to top-post - that is, make your 
reply text follow the text you are replying other than appearing before it, 
as I demonstrate here:)
Well, how much memory do you have? Does the application actually need more 
memory than your system can provide? If this is the case, there isn't going 
to be any fix except add more memory. Your choices are:
1. Let the OOM killer sacrifice processes because you don't have enough memory
2. Disable VM overcommit so that the OOM killer doesn't get engaged (rather, 
the application's attempt to grab the memory will fail)
3. Add more memory, don't mess with the overcommit sysctl, and watch things 
work nicely :P
Are you sure it's not a memory leak? Does the application work on a freshly 
booted system?
