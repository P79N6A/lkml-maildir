I've found that I can lock a machine running 2.4.23aa1 by trying to
access a nonexistent SCSI device.  In other words, if a userspace
program tries to access /dev/sdd, but no device is attached on any
SCSI bus using that device node, the machine locks hard.
We found this when we disconnected a SCSI hardware RAID from a server,
but forgot to remove the cron job which checked its status.
The lockup leaves no errors whatsoever in the logs.  I finally tracked
it down with the NMI watchdog.
