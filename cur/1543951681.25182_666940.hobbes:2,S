So you design for the number of nines you need, taking all factors
into account, and you design for the performance you need.  These are
cut and dried calculations.  FUD has no place here.

You are preaching to the converted.  Systems consisting of:
  linux + disks + batteries + ram + network + redundancy
can be as reliable as you need.  Respectfully, I would like to return
to the software engineering problem.  This driver solves a problem for
certain people.  Not niche people to be forgotten about.  If it does
not solve your problem then please just write a driver that does,
meanwhile this one needs some finishing work.  Lets get the proverbial
thousand eyeballs working.  Has anybody besides me compiled this yet?
