Hi all,
  I've tried Linux-2.4.0-test[7-9] kernel on my laptop, and got
a trouble with them. When yenta_socket and apm driver are installed,
system hangs. Each driver works fine without another one. Why?
Thanks,
	A.Yoshiyama <yosshy@debian.or.jp>
p.s.
My Laptop: NEC LaVie NX (Japan local model of NEC Versa all-in-one).
