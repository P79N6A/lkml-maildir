One thing I'd love to see in C is default values for structure members
in initializers. 
Pretty much everything else is trivially done with structures and
function pointers - once you allocate things dynamically you can (and
should) trivially and logically just make the allocator initialize the
needed fields too.  But for static allocations and static initializers
you cannot cleanly do the same thing - you have to add explicit code
that knows about each statically allocated entry. 
That's basically the only piece of object constructors that I consider
really _useful_, with the rest just being syntactic fluff.
