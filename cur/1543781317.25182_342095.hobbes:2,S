Oh, it's a good sign. There are so many people loudly complaining when a
feature is removed (including me). That means you found nobody to disagree
with you. The fact that nobody either ACKed your patch may be because nobody
is able to tell better than you if it will break anything. Maybe it's time
to repost and ask for an ACK ?
