I think this is similar to a solution that I proposed elsewhere.  You wake up
some other thread, if any, waiting on the futex.  This breaks what you call
WAKE tokens but wait morphing with FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE does that already as far
as I can tell.   A FUTEX_WAIT that has been requeued onto another futex could
return EINTR instead of zero (one of the reasons you can't loop on EINTR's in
the cond wait code).
I did an alternate lock-free implementation of pthread condition variables with
a work around of sorts for that futex wake preemption problem I mentioned earlier.
I get a 3x to 200x performance improvement depending on what you are doing.  So
naturally I would be interested in a solution that doesn't require a userspace
bottleneck.
