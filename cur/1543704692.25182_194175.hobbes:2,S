Sounds pretty shaky...

Probably a good idea.

Hmm, looks a bit strange. You want write protect to be set _if_
detection works, not otherwise. If it fails, just assume that you can
write to the drive and let the normal drive rejection work fail those
(maybe even catch them and write protect then). Seeing as the method is
unreliable, we cannot solely rely on that.
