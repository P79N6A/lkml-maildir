  Doing a strace got me this (just leaving it run until it croaked):
	time([917975878])                       = 917975878
	recvfrom(7, "\1\1\6\1\262\334sF\0\1\0\0\0\0\0"..., 1540, 0, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(68), sin_addr=inet_addr("132.241.200.1")}, [16]) = 548
	read(8, "\0`\227\337I\25\0`/q\372@\10\0E\0"..., 1500) = 590
	time([917975878])                       = 917975878
	SYS_174(0xd, 0xbfffdfd0, 0xbfffdf44, 0x8, 0xd) = 0
	send(3, "<30>Feb  2 09:17:58 dhcpd: DHCPR"..., 100, 0) = 100
	SYS_174(0xd, 0xbfffdfd0, 0, 0x8, 0xd)   = 0
	time([917975878])                       = 917975878
	SYS_174(0xd, 0xbffff2b4, 0xbffff228, 0x8, 0xd) = 0

  Can't strace and gdb at the same time, so I killed strace and ran
gdb.  This is dhcpd-2.0b1pl8 staticly linked against glibc-2.0.112 now:
	#0  0x806d212 in __libc_send ()
	#1  0x806cc08 in vsyslog (pri=6, fmt=0x9 <Address 0x9 out of bounds>,

  Grr.  Forgot to grab my new version of strace!  It bails when I
SIGPIPE it:
	send(3, "<30>Feb  2 09:17:58 dhcpd: DHCPO"..., 93, 0) = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
	--- SIGPIPE (Broken pipe) ---
	close(3)                                = 0
	sigreturn(Segmentation fault
  Now, at this point, strace and gdb aren't showing anything.  With
strace showing no activity and gdb not falling through to a prompt,
I don't know what that means.  I probably botched it at this point and
unstuck it enough that an extra SIGPIPE killed it (having fallen though
glibc's syslog() eventually).

  Smaller, but not tiny.  Enough to fit though...

  I grabbed strace-3.1ud-b9 off of cygnus.  I forgot to use it when
I did the above strace, but I put it on that computer for next time.
I had to patch it to get it to compile (see patch).  I was guessing
at the EXEC_vfork/SYS_vfork bit, but it seems to be doing what it is
supposed to be doing.

  Joy.  I'll crunch up lsof and stare at it.
  For extra ammo, up till now the linux-2.2.1 kernel was compiled with
gcc-2.7.2.3.  I also tried egcs-1.1.1 with the same results.
