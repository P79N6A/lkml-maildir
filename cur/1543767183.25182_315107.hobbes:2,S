What about inotify makes it insufficient for your needs?

A few worksets:
	- Current users, such as FAM and Samba, that need simple file
	  change notification
	- Random applications that want to watch a file or two
	- The Linux desktop
	- Real-time live-updating indexing systems, such as Beagle,
	  that compete with f.e. Apple's Spotlight.
