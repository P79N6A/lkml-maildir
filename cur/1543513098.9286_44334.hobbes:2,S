Oh usually the slots are just lined up. (Usually A is the nearest to the
CPU).
And this in no problem too since the code is only intended for
customized in house usage. Read: We will use a limited range of
motherboards
and therefore we can very well figure out what the slot layout is :-).
(Otherwise it wouldn't make any sense to go after the chipset too.)
