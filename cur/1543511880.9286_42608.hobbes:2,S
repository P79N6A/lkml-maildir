Just had my Dual Celeron BP6 misbehave. Firstly the kernel dumped a NULL
deferencing pointer error and then the load went skyhigh at which point
X wouldn't even redraw the display. I rebooted and now trying to write
to the vfat partition gives "file_cluster badly computed!!!" error
messages. I didn't see any reference to this while searching the
archives, thought it was worth of reporting.
Sorry for the lack of details but I need my system. I'm going back to
vanilla .12 which hasn't given me any problems.
