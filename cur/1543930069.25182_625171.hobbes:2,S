Subject: [PATCH] vivi driver works only as first device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Gregor Jasny <gjasny@web.de>
When the vivi driver allocates a video device, video_register_device() stores the
allocated device minor inside the vivi structure. But when the device node is opened,
the file minor number is compared to the minor in the device list. So this patch
copies the allocated minor in the device list, too.
Without this patch it is impossible to use the vivi driver mith minors greater than zero.
