Unfortunately "Creative PCI Soundblaster" is no longer enough
information for us to identify the chipset, since Creative started
marketing the (inferior) CA0106 devices as "SoundBlaster Live!" as well.
Please report your soundcard problem to the alsa-user list and include
the output of "lspci -vn | grep -A1 0401".
