Unfortunately I do not have the McKinley data yet, the NDA is worse
than the Itanium one.  Fill in later when the data is available, I
expect more McKinley steppings to be added to the list.

Early ones for compare-and-exchange.  AFAIK no recent (Itanium B3 or
later) cpu has these problems.

This is software, not hardware, debugging.  It saves addresses to help
track down spinlock problems.
