We re-ran the threaded benchmark with FUTEX_HASHBITS set to 15 (32k hash
slots) and got the same performance as the padding approach.  So increasing
the hash helps.  We also tried 256, 512, and 1024 hash slots, but we
did not get good results with those. 
We also collected hash collision statistics for 1024 slots.  We found that
50% of the slots did not take any hit!!  So maybe we should revisit the
hashing function before settling on the optimal number of hash slots. 
Thanks,
Kiran
