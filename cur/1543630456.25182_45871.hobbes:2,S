I've tried every fix I've found on Usenet for not having a network
connection after recompiling your kernel but nothing has seemed to work.
the reason i'm posting it to this list is because if I boot the old (2.2.20)
kernel from lilo my network connection is fine, but if I boot the new one
(2.4.19-pre8) I have no network connection at all!  dmesg shows that the
cards are detected perfectly, the drivers are compiled into the kernel and I
also compiled in "Socket Filter" because I was told that it might work, but
I still can't ping my firewall.  I don't know what else to try, does anyone
have any ideas?  BTW its debian-woody
