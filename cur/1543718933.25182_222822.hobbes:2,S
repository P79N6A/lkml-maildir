Let me limit the output to the interesting part:

The AMD-8151 AGP Bridge on bus #4 is missing on the 32-bit kernel.

Well, I have experienced problems with Red Hat EL 3.0 32 bit where the
old kernel doesn't support the AMD bridge. But on my tests a 2.4.25
kernel did well. So the problem is located elsewhere.

The question is how your kernel is configuring the PCI devices because
the problem is that the bridge is not listed in the output of lspci.
Try the boot parameter "pci=noacpi" so that PCI is configured the "old"
way without using probably buggy ACPI tables from the BIOS. Anyway, your
problem really looks very strange to me, because usally the kernel that
doesn't see the bridge on bus #4 won't even see the AGP card on bus #5.

Rainer
