Not really. It will break all existing codes. MPI-2 provides a call for
memory allocation (and it's beneficial to use this call for some interconnects),
but many (most?) applications are still written for MPI-1 and those that
are written for MPI-2 mostly uses the old habit of allocating memory by malloc(),
or even use stack or BSS memory for communication buffer purposes.
