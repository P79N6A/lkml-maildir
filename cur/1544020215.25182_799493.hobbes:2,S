I was searching around, trying to find out if there was another way for
kdb to do this, and I think removing the backlink is breaking other
stuff also.  dump_trace() in dumpstack_64.S is using the same trick as
KDB to trace out of the interrupt stack:
            /*
             * We link to the next stack (which would be
             * the process stack normally) the last
             * pointer (index -1 to end) in the IRQ stack:
             */
            stack = (unsigned long *) (irqstack_end[-1]);
            irqstack_end = NULL;
            ops->stack(data, "EOI");
            continue;
