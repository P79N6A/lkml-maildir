There's no reason for any non-UTF-8 to be in the tree at all, so 
eventually it won't be a problem. I'm (slowly but surely) working on 
converting everything in the tree. GCC handles UTF-8 just fine, and all 
non-stupid/non-broken distributions of GNU/Linux and other major Un*ces 
should be based on (or at least compatible with) UTF-8 in basic 
operations. Files like the keymaps will be more work to convert, but they 
can be as well.
I'm operating on the assumption that anything in the tree that isn't UTF-8 
is ISO-8859-1. Of course, I'm also checking it by hand to make sure a 
small-O-with-umlaut doesn't become the Klingon logo...
Besides, based on the actual binary representation of UTF-8, it's 
extremely unlikely for any ISO-8859-1 string to be detected as UTF-8. VIm 
already does this: UTF-8 it handles natively, but open up one of these 
unpatched files in VIm and you'll see "[converted]" at the bottom of your 
screen. Should happen if you open the attached .patch.bin file in VIm.
