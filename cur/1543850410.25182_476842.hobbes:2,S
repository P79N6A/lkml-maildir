The recent patch by Jim Houston explains the misbehaviour. It seems the 
ntp daemon uses ADJ_OFFSET_SINGLESHOT for time adjustments, which is 
rather coarse-grained. By adding proper PPS support one should be able to 
get a more stable clock, but it's better done by someone who has the 
hardware to test this.
bye, Roman
