  Let me guess, did your copy command avoided overwriting the journal.dat ?
If not it's not surprizing, that's the only way (with soft raid + ext3) 
I found to get an oops from ext3. 
  I reiterate, the ext3 code must protect the journal from user-level
process operation, or we are gonna have serious headaches in the user support
dept. :-(
