yep, that is what I consider unexpected behavior, but the 
man page doesn't say anything about other flags ... 
in the example above (which should be easy to verify) the 
'A' (noatime) flag is cleared while 'i' is set and the 
user (root) has no capability at all ...
the same is true for all other attribute flags for
ext2/ext3, reiserfs and probably other fs implementing
those attributes.
best,
Herbert
