Okay, 2.3 is out; it's time to get some fundamental data types
expanded:
REQUIRED:
uid_t, gid_t:	32 bits minimum, 32 bits probably OK.
dev_t:		32 bits minimum, suggest 64 bits (split 16:48, 24:40
		or 32:32).
SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED:
off_t, time_t, ino_t.
It seems to me that the proper implementation order of these are:
1. Implement in the filesystems, especially ext2.
   Recall that uid_t, gid_t and dev_t both have -1 (0xffff) reserved
   in a 16-bit environment; the two former because -1 is special in most
   system calls and the latter by explicit allocation for this
   purpose.
   dev_t should be easy: most filesystems store device numbers in
   block pointers, and have plenty of spare block pointers.  UMSDOS
   doesn't, but has a 12-byte spare field.  UMSDOS also have the
   option of migrating to a new format and have umssync do the
   conversion.  If so, I suggest the following:
   a. Call the file --umsdos.--- (a filesystem shouldn't be
      OS-specific, really...)
   b. Store the unmangled name in the file!  Since the DOS namespace
      is, to put it mildly, weird, it's probably quite a bad idea to
      assume that we'll be able to keep the mangling scheme constant
      while needing to avoid things like common device names
      (MSCD001, anyone?)
2. Implement the system calls.
3. Hook it up in glibc.
