disc->receive_buf is single threaded but if it then sends characters back
in the same context (eg flow control) you get re-entry in the driver.

tty_write() is the layer above the ldisc. tty_write() feeds a line
discipline from (usually) user space. Line disciplines write direct to
the tty.

What status do you need to poll ?
