Hi,
Randy, Simen and list
I am sorry , I could not reply ur post on 6th oct as I  have noticed
ur reply today. But I have got the solution for this.
During make menuconfig I forgot to include MPT FUSION device support
in my erlier compilation. But Now this is working fine
I am sorry If this has created any confusion among the list.
Or If its really an issue then let me know also.
Thanks
