I got bored this evening and decided to learn more about the Linux kernel
by splitting out procfs into two separate file systems:
taskfs which contains /proc/self and /proc/[1-9]*
kernfs which contains everything else that procfs provides.
You can get the quick hack from here (this patch is against 2.4.0-test10):

I've tested the two file systems on the user-mode-linux kernel. :-)
They both seem to work as expected, even when /proc is mounted.
Alexander Viro, is this kernfs at all useful as a starting point for your
kernfs goals?
