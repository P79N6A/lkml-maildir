# but mostly it simply avoids actually being a desktop...
<pedantic>
That's because it's a windowing system/GUI, not a desktop... :)
</pedantic>
Historically, the desktop and the GUI were the same thing - usually
because they were created by the same group of people (and were
traditionally closed-source). The X Window system is a free software/open
source programmer's dream in this respect, in that the two aren't locked
together in such a way that replacing one half requires extreme hackery
and horribleness.
That said, last time I looked at the sources to a window manager, it was
pretty horrible.. ;)
