If you read the release notes for RH9 you'll see you can adjust what
thread library gets used with the environmental variable
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL.  So for instance you can do:
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 rpm ....
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 up2date 
(I've mentioned these two because I've noted these fail when you are
root...)
