root=0302 works for me, but root=/dev/hda2 and root=hda2 both fail, even
though /sys/block/hda/hda2/dev contains good values.
Hm, looks like try_path() in init/do_mounts.c generates paths which
don't exist.  If you specify root=/dev/hda2, try_paths will look in 
/sys/block/hda2/dev, but it needs to be /sys/block/hda/hda2/dev.  I
tried playing with it a bit, but then it started trying to mount from
hda4 for no obvious reason...
But this should be enough to go on with.
