I'm not sure about "freak", but:
#include <time.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    time_t t = (time_t) 0x7fffffff;
    puts(ctime(&t));
    return 0;
}
gives me Mon Jan 18 22:14:07 2038.  I guess I was a little surprised
to find that negative time_t's do map to pre-epoch values.  just
turning time_t unsigned would give us 2106.  personally, I'd like to
see a higher-resolution time function, something like 64b of ns
since the epoch.  and this time, let's make the epoch Linus's b-day ;)
