I have not seen this kind of error in years, why have you not reported
it?
Can you enable debugging in the pl2303 driver with a simple:
	modprobe pl2303 debug=1
or when the driver is running with:
	echo 1 > /sys/module/pl2303/parameters/debug
That way you can see the data flowing through the device.  If the host
sends it to the device, perhaps your device is just dropping it somehow?
These pl2303 devices are really cheap, there are lots of different
variations of them, and none of them are documented at all.  We might be
missing some kind of interaction here, but in my tests, I have not had
any lost data.
Are you sure your userspace program isn't constantly setting the line
settings?  We have seen instances where the device does get confused and
resets itself if that happens a lot.  That was just fixed in the last
kernel release.
