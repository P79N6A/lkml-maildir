   It's already implemented.  Similar to Sun's scheme.  And it's possible
   to completely disable it if you don't need it.
Linus, Ulrich is right here.  It costs next to nothing, it costs the
same 1 stat/open/mmap if the optimized library is present, ld.so
already has the platform string formed by the time ld.so begins the
search.
