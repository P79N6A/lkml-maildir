If that's what it really does, fine. I'm not sure it really finds hogs,
though, or rather "finds only true hogs."

While this does a good job I'm still worried that we don't have a good
handle on which processes are realy interactive in term of interfacing
with a human. I don't think we can make the scheduler do the right thing
in every case unless it has better information.
