No, the problem is in not understanding UML.
UML's state is somewhat more complicated than the state of a native kernel.
You also need to recreate 
	the host processes
	the ptrace relationships between the tracing thread and the other 
processes
	open file descriptors
	and maybe a few other things that aren't coming to mind
