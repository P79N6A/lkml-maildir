Greetings.
It seems that the recent shower of error reports was caused by my not so thorough testing of the
R6 handling problems (I've sent you a patch for this).
However, there is this other problem with mmc_host_remove while transfer is in progress.
First, I disabled my "sleep on remove" hack. Then I've set up a transfer (dd if=/dev/mmcblk0
of=/dev/null) and pulled the card out. The result was a hard crash (irq handler style) soon
followed by additional one, so the numbers in this hand-grabbed dump may be inexact:
--------
elv_next_request+0x15d/0x1e0
:mmc_core:mmc_queue_thread+0x72/0x110
:mmc_core:mmc_queue_thread+0x0/0x110
keventd_create_kthread+0x0/0x90
kthread+0xd9/0x120
child_rip+0xa/0x12
keventd_create_kthread+0x0/0x90
kthread+0x0/0x120
child_rip+0x0/0x12
RIP :mmc_core:mmc_prep_request+0x4d/0x70
----------
I'm continuing to look for possible problems in my code.
