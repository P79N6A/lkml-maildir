Look at 2.3.35 pre patches, there are my changes to the pm2fb which ought to
support any permedia2 and permedia2v cards (tested on Raptor Permedia2v
/SPARC only though).
The old driver was recognizing from PCI cards only TI cards, not 3DLabs
cards (plus several things changed because 2v differs from 2 a little bit).
If you'll have problems with it, let me know.
Cheers,
