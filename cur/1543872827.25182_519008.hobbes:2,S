i mean the groupping of timer expiries happens automatically when 
high-res is disabled. When high-res is asked for then, duh, it's enabled 
and you get precise timeouts ;-)

I was talking about the "micro-effect" of grouping timer expiries.

yeah, we had that in earlier versions, it's trivial - nobody used it. So 
i'll wait for the actual measurements and a patch (or i can do the patch 
too, if someone comes up with the measurements). I've added 
/proc/timer_stats and /proc/timer_info for exactly such reasons.
( note that we've added the facility for even more imprecise sleeps to 
  the timer_list APIs - but for hrtimers it's a lot less clear-cut case. )
