Most likely it says very bad things about getcwd() implementation in Perl
compared to sys_getcwd() in the kernel.  The latter just walks the chain
of dentries copying ->d_name.name into the buffer.  The former... my guess
would be stat ".", open "..", readdir from it, stat every damn object in
there until you find one with the right ->st_ino, put its name as the
last component and repeat the whole thing until you reach root...
