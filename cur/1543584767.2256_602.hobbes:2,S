yep, agreed.

nope:

exactly, and that is a feature. We want to find all those places, because
disabling IRQs for too long can cause problems in unrelated kernel code.
SysRq-T is a special case so touch_nmi() is justified in that and only
that case. The NMI watchdog is something that gives security, and we want
to be very conservative disabling its effect.
[i've attached nmi-watchdog-2.4.2-A2 (against -ac18) which adds your fix
to clear all alert counters in touch_nmi_watchdog().]
