Hi,
	There's a new patch against 2.5.24 available at
http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/patches/2.5.24-lbd-patch
or can be pulled from bk://gelato.unsw.edu.au:2023/
With this patch large scsi discs are detected and sized correctly; and
it's possible create block devices using raid up to 16TB on 32-bit
platforms, and as large as you like on 64-bit platforms.
Tested at present on i386 and ia64.
The patch:
    -- uses sector_t instead of int where blocks or sectors are
counted
	(sector_t is either unsigned long  or u64 depending on
CONFIG_LBD)
   -- fixes bogus sign extensions when calculating scsi capacity
   -- modifies the partitioning code so that EFI GPT at least can
      specify partitions using 64-bit numbers.
   -- Fixes the loop device to allow large backing files or devices,
      and to fail gracefully if the backing file is too large.
