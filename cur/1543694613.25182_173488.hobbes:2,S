Would a single command to read a sector ignoring drive remaps really be 
that hard/expensive/large in size to implement?  I'd expect this would 
easily fit in the spare room at the end of the ROM - the function is 
pretty much (no doubt) already implemented - it just lacks an external 
interface.
I think this is all we really need - sure more would be nice, but this 
would suffice for those who say remaps without reading in the data 
correctly first are bad.
