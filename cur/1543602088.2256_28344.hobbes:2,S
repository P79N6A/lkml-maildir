Correct, fsync is unchanged, but sync() does rely on the super dirty bit.
If the super isn't dirty, then sync doesn't try to force metadata to disk
at all.

Well, kreiserfsd usually writes the log blocks, when a transaction ends on
its own (full, or too old).  If someone requests a synchronous commit
(fsync, any caller of write_super), that process writes the log blocks
themselves.  So, kupdated ends up writing log blocks too.
Plus, reiserfs uses write_super as a trigger for metadata writeback, so
kupdate writes those blocks as well.
