This is not what happens on other platforms.  At least with my limited
testing I found that if you do on Solaris
	sleep 10
	^Z
	fg
the process will continue to sleep.

This is the least what has to happen.

No, it's not the only place (e.g., blocking read call).  I think this
is a general change.  Whenever the continue happens throug
PTRACE_CONTINUE no EINTR should be generated.
