I mean what used to be the ptep_set_access_flags path. Where you are
now modifying a pte without the ptl. However after a second look, it
seems like that won't be a problem.

Yes I know. I would say that having arch-definable accessors for the
page tables wouldn't be a bad idea anyway, and the flexibility may
come in handy for other things.
It would be a big, annoying patch though :(
