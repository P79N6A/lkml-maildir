NOTE: the build problem you have is -rt specific. In any case it is not 
due to this new HRT introduction but due to another, -rt only feature or 
high-res timers: the ability to asynchronously wait on their completion 
without polling. But that does not matter to -mm kernels.
I have put your .config into the new -mm queue Thomas submitted and it 
compiled and booted just fine.

please check whether the patch below (ontop of -rt10) fixes this for 
you.
