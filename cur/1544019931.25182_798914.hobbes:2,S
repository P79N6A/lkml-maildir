I think a lot of the confusion here comes from Arve's earlier (very
terse) remark:  "I never expected it to be merged. I wrote it to allow 
us to ship a product."
At the risk of putting words in his mouth, I believe this should be
parsed as "we wrote this to solve problems necessary to ship products
and did not expect it to be merged to mainline as-is".  
We'd love to get support for low memory process killing that works for
our app model into the mainline.  If that's by reworking this driver
until it's acceptable or by implementing the same functionality a
different way, making use of some other subsystem, or whatever, we're
not particularly picky.  Our goal is, eventually, to maintain as few
patches outside of the kernel as possible so things can build "out of
the box."
