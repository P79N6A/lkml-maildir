Hmmm Chip, on the document you suggested us to read, I remember a statement
about (!x) <=> (x == 0) which implied it's legal even if x is a pointer because
the compiler will automatically do the comparison between x and NULL and not
(int)x and 0. Perhaps I have dreamed, but I'm sure I read this. So in any case,
the !!(x) construct should be valid.
Cheers,
Willy
