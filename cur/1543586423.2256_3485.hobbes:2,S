Actually, I do have a similar problem that I've been unable to track down
100%.  Under 2.4.x when I run the modem on my Xircom Cardbus 10/100
Ethernet/56K Modem combo card (installed in a Dell 5000e with 650Mhz Pentium
III) I get a fair number of dropped packets at 115Kbps, enough to cause
problems and a significant speed decrease.  Simply dropping the serial port
rate to 56K seems to solve the problem.  I'm actually suspicious that the
hardware handshaking isn't working quite right, but I haven't take the time
to look at it.
I never noticed the problem under 2.2.x, but the last kernel I ran from that
era was the 2.2.16 kernel included with Redhat 7.  I've really not looked at
it very hard, backing the speed down to 56K was a good enough solution for
me for now, the Xircom has such a troublesome history that I just blamed it
on that but your report makes me more curious.
Later,
Tom
