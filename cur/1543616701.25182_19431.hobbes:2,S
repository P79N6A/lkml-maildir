Thanks. I added that and now I'm just left with sk_run_filter
undef'ed without the GPLONLY_ warning.
I've deleted my kernel sources and am starting everything over
from scratch.  I checked that 'CONFIG_FILTER' was defined
and all seemed in order, but still got the error.
I read through the last few months of the CIPE archives and there
is no mention of such a problem.  Others mention running with
2.4.17, hence my start over.
