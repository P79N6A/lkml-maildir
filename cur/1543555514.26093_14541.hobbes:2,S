Hi Peter, thanks for the feedback. 
Actually, I have an opinion on this matter: If the initialization
value doesn't really matter that much, I like leave out the
initialization, as you suggest.
However, if my code assumes that the compiler needs to initialize the
variable one way or another, I want to put in the initialization, even
if that means an "= 0;" which is already the default.
This is a form of documentation.
				Roger.
