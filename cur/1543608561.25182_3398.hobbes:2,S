What I would like to know is: What is at 0x3f0-0x3f1 on
your machine, and why does your PnP BIOS list these
two ioports as used by "system peripheral: other"?
On my ThinkPad 600, the BIOS lists 0x3f0-0x3f5 as owned
by the floppy device:
jdthood@thanatos:~$ sudo lspnp -v 08
08 PNP0700 mass storage device: floppy
	irq 6
	io 0x03f0-0x03f5
	dma 2
It looks like there's a bug in your BIOS.  What we could do is
patch the PnP BIOS driver so that it refrains from reserving 
0x3f0-0x3f1.
I'll let others comment on the appropriateness of your patch
to floppy.c .  I don't know whether it's the right thing to
do or not.
