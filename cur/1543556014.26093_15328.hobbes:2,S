Days are also numbered from one (at least smbfs) and this change doesn't
do anything about that. An all zero date gives 315446400 (or else my
testprogram is broken) and you wanted it to give 315532800 (?). So that
should be fixed too, I think.
It would be nice if someone would rewrite these shift-and-mask orgies into
something with a bit more structure (bitfields? hmm, endianess problems?
undefined compiler behaviour? I don't know ... macros?).
I'm having trouble following these, but maybe that's just me.
