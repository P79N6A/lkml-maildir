The only problem with things like IPSec is renegotiation, which
can take up memory right at the time you don't have any extra
memory available.
Decrypting individual IPSec packets during normal operation and
then dropping the ones for non-critical sockets should work just
fine.
The problem is layered networks over TCP, where you have to
process the packets in-order and may have no choice but to hold
onto data for non-critical sockets, at least for a while.

In short:
  - every incoming packet needs to be received at the packet level
  - when memory is low, we only deliver data to memory critical sockets
  - packets to other sockets get dropped, so the memory can be reused
    for receiving other packets, including the packets needed for the
    memory critical sockets to make progress
Forwarding packets while in low memory mode should not be a problem
at all, since forwarded packets get freed quickly.
The memory pool for receiving packets does not need much accounting
of any kind, since every packet will end up coming from that pool
when normal allocations start failing.   Maybe Evgeniy's allocator
can do something smarter internally, and mark skbuffs as MEMALLOC
when the number of available skbuffs is getting low?
Part (most?) of the problem space is explained here:
