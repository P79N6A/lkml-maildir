The description/option is not correct. The mainline kernel never disables C1e.
Some distribution kernels and Xen do, perhaps you're confusing this 
with them.
You would rather need a "force_disable_c1e" option if anything.
Anyways this should be near all obsolete with forced HPET. With HPET
dynticks can be used even with C1e. So in most cases you can just
use hpet=force instead and get dynticks and C1e together.
