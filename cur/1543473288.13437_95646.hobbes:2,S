Not to mention the balance of HJ Liu's fixes to NFS locking and RPC
services.  I note that a number of them are missing from 2.2.0-pre1.
These are absolutely essential for reliable lockd/statd function.  If
there is a rationale for leaving them out of the release version of 2.2,
please enlighten me?
They are not new, and HJ has been trying to get them into the official
sources for over three months.
