I wanted to test 2.4.8-ac10 to see if the oops on mounting /proc/bus/usb
was fixed.  But I wasn't able to get that far.  I got a panic on trying to
mount the root device (30:01).
I did nothing more than back up my .config file, blow away the Linux
source directory (tried reversing off the patches, but I got lost
somewhere, so I started over), unpack a fresh 2.4.8, patch it up with
-ac10, restore my .config, make oldconfig, dep, install.
I didn't touch my lilo.conf or anything else.
Looking through your changes I didn't notice any mention of changes to the
DAC960 driver (which my root file system resides on).
I had the same thing happen to me at home on a machine with just a scsi
root in a Linus kernel.  I had to make changes to my lilo.conf to get it
to work, but then I had to change it back with the next release.  So I
don't want to jump to any changes just yet.
