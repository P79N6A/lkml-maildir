For the kernel example, I only ever compile once before rebooting[1]
:)
This I think is the kind of thing that a kernel will never
automatically detect. This *must* be in the hands of the
administrator, who will know what they are doing (hopefully).
[1] I have never had enough memory on machines that I use to compile
kernels, to cache an entire tree anyway -- I'd much rather mozilla use
it than a cache which will never be reused
