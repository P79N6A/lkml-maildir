I should add one thing: anyone who advocates a solution where the
virtual filesystem (devfs) is the central thing rather than the device
daemon, really needs to think about ACLs.  ACLs for ext2 have been in
the pipeline for a long time now, but they will happen sooner or
later, and people will want to set ACLs on devices (in fact, devices
is one of the most useful places to have ACLs.)  You really don't want
to store your ACLs in kernel space...
