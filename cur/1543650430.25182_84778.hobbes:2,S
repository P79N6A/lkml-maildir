Yes. But it needs the /usr/share/zoneinfo/`cat /etc/timezone` file for this.
That file contains a record of when daylight saving time was in effect
for that country. It's handling is in standart C library. But kernel
does not use C library and does not load files. Thus it does not know,
weather DST was in effect at some time...
