  It hangs forever (over an hour anyway.)  And it's definitely taking the
MAX_TIMEOUT case (wait forever) in schedule_timeout().
  Yes, RTS/CTS is enabled but nothing is connected... and just attaching
a nullmodem adapter that lights up CTS, DTR and CD makes the problem go
away.
  Does that mean this is a minicom problem because it didn't specify
a timeout?
