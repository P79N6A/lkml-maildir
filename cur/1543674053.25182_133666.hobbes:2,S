More important than 'tpconfig' is that the native synaptics drivers for 
both gpm and XFree86 won't work under 2.5+ either.
Jens Taprogee has also been working on a Synaptics Input driver.  The 
main difference in what I have is that his passes the absolute events up 
to the mousdev layer, which in turn does the heavy lifting.  Much better 
IMO, as mousedev can get new features which will apply to all 
absolute-mode touchpads and other input devices.
