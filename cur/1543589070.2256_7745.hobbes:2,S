Same scenario, but with read-in-progress started before we do getblk(). BTW,
old writeback is harmless - we will overwrite anyway. And _that_ can happen
without direct access to device - truncate() doesn't terminate writeout of
the indirect blocks it frees (IMO it should, but that's another story).
