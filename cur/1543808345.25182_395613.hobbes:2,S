I just want to imply the use of optimized hweight*() routines to
kbuild system.  In other word I want to tell the kbuild system
the condition of "defined(__alpha_fix__) && defined(__alpha_cix__)".
So I suggested to add previous patch and write below lines in
arch/alpha/Kconfig
config GENERIC_HWEIGHT
        bool
        default y if !ALPHA_EV6 && !ALPHA_EV67
Also, I wonder why there are such gcc builtin definition in kernel code.
Even if the gcc built with the support architecture extensions like CIX
and FIX, It doesn't mean the vmlinux built by that gcc always run
on those machines.
