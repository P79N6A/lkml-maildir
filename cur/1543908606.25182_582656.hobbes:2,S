The box has a short 40-wire cable, so pata_artop drops to udma/33
while aec62xx does udma/100 without intervention. I added an override
to artop6260_cable_detect() to make it return PATA40_SHORT on this
platform, and with that it does udma/100 as expected.
Read performance fluctuates quite a bit, but seems to be 1-3 MB/s
slower than aec62xx on average. I compared lspci -vvxxx and the
only differences are a latency setting and some ROM thingy:

Yes, I now see that happening also with the IDE aec62xx driver.
It used to only be a single-line WARNING, only recently has the
ARM kernel started to also do a stack dump when it triggers.
