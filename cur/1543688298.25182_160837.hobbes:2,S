The driver could be a module and live in initramfs.  If you can
get the initial Linux image and initramfs loaded, you would be okay.
The problem is more in the bootloader (LILO or GRUB) would not no how
to do raid. The /boot partition would have to be on a non-raid partition.
Same problem if driver is statically linked in the kernel.
