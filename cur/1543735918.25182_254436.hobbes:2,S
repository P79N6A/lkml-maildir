Hi,
  Is there a user space or perhaps simple kernel module way to
rescan the pci bus?  I currently have a user mode program modify
the pci bus, but I can not push the user mode program to the
bios for reasons I can't get in to.  
  Currently I use this user mode program, then do a big hammer
approach of a reboot to get the kernel to see the pci device.  Is there
a nicer way of doing this?  Can someone kindly educate me.
Huge Thanks,
Dave:)
