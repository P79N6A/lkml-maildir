well, i would say this - put yourself into the shoes of a kernel
developer who barely has time to keep track of the large volume of
development work, discussions, testing, etc. Then someone who claims to
be not a kernel developer, who isn't subscribed to the list comes along
and says 'there is _no_ innovation in the linux kernel'. What would your
reaction be?
I'm not a kernel developer myself, but i think there are lots of
resources on the internet where you can read watered down versions of
discussions happening on this list.

Of course, everyone wants to learn from the gurus. But confronting them
in this way hardly seems the right way ;)
