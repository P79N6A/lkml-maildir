livelock
/li:v'lok/ n. A situation in which some critical stage of a task is
unable to finish because its clients perpetually create more work
for it to do after they have been serviced but before it can clear its
queue. Differs from {deadlock} in that the process is not blocked or
waiting for anything, but has a virtually infinite amount of work to
do and can never catch up. 
This exactly describes the sync problem.  But we also use the
term `livelock' to describe one of the Linux VM's favourite
failure modes: madly spinning on page lists and not finding
any useful work to do.  Which is slightly different.
