Even more appropriately, you have the inode->i_mapping lists that you can
use directly (no need to do lookups, just walk the list).
Note that bumping the counts is _NOT_ as easy as you seem to think. The
problem: vmtruncate() and friends. It's much easier to just have a flag
that gets cleared on truncate.
