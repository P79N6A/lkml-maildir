People start trying to do things like 
	echo 1 minute > /proc/sys/kernel/panic
and expecting it to work :)  After all, the whole idea of the interface
is it looks/acts like a small text file, right?
Seriously, though, if you are dealing with the files in /proc you're
typically doing so for a reason and while many/most cases have obvious
units, the ones that don't (like this) are easy enough to look up.
I'd rather see better Documentation/ entries covering the /proc entries
as they get added rather than bloat the kernel with such code.
