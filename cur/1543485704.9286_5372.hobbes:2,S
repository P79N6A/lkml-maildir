(bounced the first time)
I've been fiddling with the settings in PNP BIOS setup, but I still
haven't had any luck.  Specifically, which settings did you change and
what are they set to?  PNP OS Installed was turned off.  I tried turning
it on.  There was a setting called "IRQ 11 used by ISA".  It was set to
"No/ICU" by default.  I tried setting it  to "Yes". Neither one of these
changed helped with my problem.  I have an Award BIOS -- is that the
same
as yours?
Thanks for the help,
Geoff Hardy
