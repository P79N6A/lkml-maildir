Hi Hugh,

I'm trying to reproduce the problem you saw (so that I can then test 
your proposed fix).  However, I haven't had any luck.  I've got a 
pie-compiled version of bash, and I've been running it in a loop for a 
while now with the original randomization patch.  (I can clearly see the 
base address bouncing around.)
I'm at just over 10 million exec's, and I haven't hit the problem.  :(
Do you have any clues on how to trigger this more reliably?
Also, does anyone have any thoughts on why x86 uses a ELF_ET_DYN_BASE 
below the libraries, where as x86_64 uses one above them?  From this, 
I'd expect x86_64 to collide with the libraries at times.  I need more 
help understanding the memory layouts, I guess.  :)
Thanks,
