Linux forbin 2.0.36 #2 SMP Sun Apr 4 14:04:56 AKDT 1999 i686 unknown
  7:40pm  up 435 days,  2:43,  1 user,  load average: 5.46, 5.30, 5.28
	Dual PPro 200Mhz, 128M ECC FPM @66mhz
	Ultra-Wide + Cheetas
	Box has been rebooted once since the last kernel build, when
we lost power for 4 hrs.  We had 3.5 hrs backup power.
	Right about the network io though, it will easily max a single
100Mbit interface, but won't go past 180Mbit total (box has 2 100Mbit
FD interfaces).
