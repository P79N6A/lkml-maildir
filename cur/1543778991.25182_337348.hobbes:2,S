here's an updated patch. It handles one more detail: on SCHED_SMT we 
should check the idleness of siblings too. Benchmark numbers still look 
good.

do wakeup-balancing only if the wakeup-CPU (or any of its siblings)
is idle.
this prevents excessive wakeup-balancing while the system is highly
loaded, but helps spread out the workload on partly idle systems.
