Do you have large block device support turned on or off in your kernel 
build options? I believe this compile warning came as a result of 
compiling without CONFIG_LBD - I hadn't tried building that way and 
would then have missed this problem. Just typecasting the result as your 
patch does should work correctly either way though. I'll make sure to 
pull it into my NBD sources but you will need to get Andrew Morton or 
Paul Clements to pick up the patch for it to move into the kernel distro 
stream. I've CC'd them on this message to help expedite this. Thanks!
