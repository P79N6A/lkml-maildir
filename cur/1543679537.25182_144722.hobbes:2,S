The issue is that on 32-bit platforms, 64bit divided by 32 bit is
handed off to a subroutine _udivdi3 which isn't linked into the
kernel, and  which in any case does a full 64 bit by 64-bit division
(which is slow).
Using do_div() allows one to generate near-optimal code for a 64by32
bit division/remainder on platforms (e.g., IA32) which have problems,
and generating something sane for other platforms (e.g., IA64).
Platforms that never expect to deal with a 64-bit number just redefine
the macro in terms of long.  Which means that printing out long longs
doesn't work properly on those architectures.

You are lost in a maze of BitKeeper repositories,   all slightly different.
