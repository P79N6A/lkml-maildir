Subject: [PATCH]  Avoid race when updating nr_unused count of unused dentries.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

d_count == 1 is no guarantee that dentry is on the dentry_unused list,
even if it has just been incremented inside dcache_lock, as dput can
decrement at any time.
This test from Greg Banks is much safer, and is more transparently correct.
