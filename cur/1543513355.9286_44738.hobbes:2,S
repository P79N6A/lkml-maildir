multi-lun IDE devices do exist, so in that sense the driver is correct
in allowing multi-lun probes. It is just that most IDE devices ignore
the LUN field and respond to each LUN. This is usually just a minor
inconvinience, as the device is detected eight times.
Over the times, there have been reports of actual kernel oopes which seemed
related to multi-lun support on the surface, and I repeatedly got patches
which disabled multi-lun probing, even though the multi-lun support iself
can't be the cause of the problem; it just allows the SCSI subsystem
to send packet commands with a lun field different than zero. Any kernel
crash has its reasons in another (real) bug.
That said, there might be a way to support multi-lun devices and still
detect normal devices just once. multi-lun devices are supposed to have
a "max lun" field in response to the ATAPI IDENTIFY command, and perhaps
multi-lun devices return x > 0 in those fields, while other return 0
(or perhaps 7?).
If anybody is interested in testing this, add something like:
	if (drive->id)
		printk("%s: last-lun: %d\n", drive->name,
			drive->id->word126 & 0x7);
to idescsi_setup in drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.c. To know if we can use this
field, we need test results both from users of multi-lun IDE devices
(such as PD-CD drives), and from users of single-lun IDE devices.

No, having a cd-changer on another SCSI card should not be related to
ide-scsi. Enabling multi-lun should add support for both.
