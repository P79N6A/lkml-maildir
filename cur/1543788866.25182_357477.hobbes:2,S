Okay, I've verified that dpkg on sarge doesn't call mmap.
strace snippet:
umask(022)                              = 022
open("/var/lib/dpkg/status", O_RDONLY)  = 3
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
close(3)                                = 0
open("/var/lib/dpkg/updates/", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_DIRECTORY) = 3
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0
fcntl(3, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)           = 0
getdents64(3, /* 2 entries */, 4096)    = 48
getdents64(3, /* 0 entries */, 4096)    = 0
close(3)                                = 0
open("/var/lib/dpkg/available", O_RDONLY) = 3
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
close(3)                                = 0
exit_group(0, 0, 0x2aaaaadfc530, 0x2, 0x2aaaaae00640 <unfinished ... exit status
So, the impact is restricted on trying to run woody dpkg 
on newer kernels.
