It is "part of kernel.org", it's called 2.4.32. The kernel developers 
can hardly be expected to release a patch for every vulnerability 
against every possible kernel version ever released..
If you need guaranteed security patches against a specific version of 
the kernel you should likely be using a distribution kernel and not a 
vanilla kernel.
