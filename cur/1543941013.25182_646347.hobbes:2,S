Hi Bill,
> I see similar results on my test systems
Thanks for this report and for confirming our observations.  Could you 
please confirm that a single-port bidrectional UDP link runs at wire 
speed?  This helps to localize the problem to the TCP stack or interaction 
of the TCP stack with the e1000 driver and hardware.
Cheers,
 	Bruce
