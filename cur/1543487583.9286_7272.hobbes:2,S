  The autofs module should respond to "media eject" requests.
  When the user presses the eject button on an LS-120 or CDROM, it
doesn't work when the device is mounted.  This is good.  However, it
would be nice if the autofs module could be notified and so it could
perform an unmount followed by an eject.
  It is possible that processes with open descriptors on the device
would prevent this.  Obviously you shouldn't unmount or eject in that
instance.
  The other thing is "what happens when the eject isn't a request?" as
with old floppy drives.  If you wanted to get clever you could "detect
disk change" and force unmount the device (possibly killing processes)
with a kernel message about lost data.
