I've seen this on my Dell P3 700 machine several times. Seems to happen at odd
intervals after I use my CD burner, but that just might be coincidental. But
I'd like to point out that I've never seen this on my VIA686a itself. The P3
machine is UP too, not SMP. I saw this ever since I switched the machine to
2.4.2-ac8 and beyond (previously 2.2.18).
