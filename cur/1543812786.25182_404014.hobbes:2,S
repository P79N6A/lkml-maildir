My suspect was that the failing addr was the same one I had already
seen some time ago with memtest86+ and that was (apparently?) fixed by
disabling "bank interleaving" in the BIOS.
But now that I've rechecked... it was a different address:
76.1 MB -- 04c0 37fc
TEST 6
good	FF FF FF FD
bad	F7 FF FF FD
The one detected with DEBUG_SLAB is at 208.99 MB (so both problems are
in my first 256MB memory module) but I'm unable to reproduce it with
memtest86+...
I wonder if these two are related in some way... or maybe it's just a
weak memory module ;)
