Well, this is in part because it makes the assumption of such a data
structure and then does if (scheduler_type == FOO) { /* FOO's thing */ }
in the midst of various manipulations of the struture instead of having
methods for higher-level scheduler operations.
As certain reputable news sources have said, I wish people would write
more ambitious scheduler patches. =)
