Isn't this supposed to be transparent?
I've recompiled both X 4.0 and gimp 1.1.18.
They amongst others are reporting warnings or errors.  Netscape handles
it fine.  Gimp doesn't.  X burps lots of console blather.
Yes I have /var/shm and etc.
Where do we go from here?  I'm not sure requiring all shm programs to be
recompiled is going to be a good thing.
