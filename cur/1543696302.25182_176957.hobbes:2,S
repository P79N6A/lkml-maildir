(2.4 kernel)
When a process is running in the kernel, can it be pre-empted at
any time?  (Unless you explicity disable preemption.)  I think not,
because wouldn't it be unsafe to grab a spinlock?  Or does grabbing a
spinlock disable preemption.  I mean spin_lock(), not spin_lock_irqsave().
Secondly, can multiple processes be in the kernel at the same time?  I
think so, that's the reason for the fine grained locks instead of the BKL.
Or do fine grained locks only serve to allow preemption.
thanks!
