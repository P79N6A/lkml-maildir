Pretty standard fare that when you add something or change APIs, most
of the burden is on you to not break the kernel. I'd love nothing better
than to remove all but about 3 filesystems :)
It is reasonable to expect some help from maintainers, but I notice you
didn't even CC the SLOB maintainer in the patch to remove SLOB! So maybe
if you tried working a bit closer with him you could get better results?

Quickly -- as in you quickly sweep the savings of 100s of K under the
rug and just declare that it is insignificant :)
