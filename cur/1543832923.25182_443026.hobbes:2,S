gcc gives the following warning:
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC      drivers/ide/pci/jmicron.o
drivers/ide/pci/jmicron.c: In function ‘ata66_jmicron’:
drivers/ide/pci/jmicron.c:99: warning: control reaches end of non-void function
...
<--  snip  -->
At least from gcc's perspective, this warning is correct, and it should 
therefore be fixed.

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
