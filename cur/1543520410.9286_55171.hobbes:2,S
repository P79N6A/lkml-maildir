Subject: Hmm, APIC error problem in devel kernel and DVD question

When I do a `dmesg' in kernel 2.3.34, I get:
APIC error interrupt on CPU#1, should never happen.
... APIC ESR0: 00000000
... APIC ESR1: 00000002
... bit 1: APIC Receive CS Error (hw problem).
repeatedly with different numbers, what does that mean?
Also, when mounting an unencrypted DVD movie, it works fine when I mount
it with an iso9660 filesystem, and doesn't work with udf.  Errors given
by dmesg describe the lack of a udf fs, so I assume that this DVD uses
iso9660, except when trying to read a file on it, I get an I/O error.  The
filesystem works fine, I just can't read from it.
Specific errors:
ATAPI device hda:
  Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05)
  Illegal mode for this track or incompatible medium -- (asc=0x64,
ascq=0x00)
  The failed "Test Unit Ready" packet command was:
  "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 "
hda: command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: command error: error=0x50
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:00 (hda), sector 10832
ATAPI device hda:

Anyone know what the problem is? The DVD-drive isn't broken btw.
