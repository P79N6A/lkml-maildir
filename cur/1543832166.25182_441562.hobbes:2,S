This is turning into an ugly flamewar that will help no one. Why not
take the best from both swsusp and suspend2, and get a nice
implementation into the kernel, that works most of the times ! About
time, already.
I know its easy to sit back and say 'do it', however, atleast it is
time already to stop this war. This 'suxrulz' thing is helping no one.
