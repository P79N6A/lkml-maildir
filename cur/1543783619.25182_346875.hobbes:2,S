Not at all.  The private, COW areas.  They may be writeable in the sense
that VM_WRITE is set, but pte_write permission cannot be in vm_page_prot,
or we'd never get the fault when to Copy On Write.
What is bogus, I think, are those places where we do the reverse:
like do_anonymous_page's pte_wrprotect of its mkpte of the ZERO_PAGE.
