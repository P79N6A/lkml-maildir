Hello, world!\n
   I've just merged most of my new PCI changes with the stuff Linus
wrote in pre-2.3.13-6. The result is available on 
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/
pub/linux/pci/alpha/l-pci-resource-2.3.13-6.gz and you can read the
summary of my changes just below.
				Have a nice fortnight

"New PC concept: "plug and pray""
Summary of changes:
o  Merged in my base address / region size reading code.
o  Expansion ROM is now the seventh resource region.
o  PCI quirks are no longer optional since they contain vital fixes.
o  PCI bridge optimization removed, it's broken since beginning and
   there's a nice userland utility doing these things.
o  Moved locking of configuration space accesses and alignment
   checks to generic code.
o  i386 support code now supports a new parameter "pci=rom" which causes
   address space to be assigned to expansion ROMs (just an experimental
   feature).
o  i386: allocation of I/O regions forgotten by the BIOS now uses
   the new resource management code.
o  Use pci_dev->name whereever possible.
o  pcibios_fixup_ghosts: you cannot use memcmp for comparison of resource
   structs since they contain name pointers.
o  PCI resources are prepared in generic code, but really allocated
   in the arch-dependent one since many architectures need to assign
   the addresses themselves.
o  Changed the low-level configuration register interface -- the old one
   was very messy and all architectures had to have their own config
   mechanism multiplexer routines and lookup tables mapping PCI bus numbers
   to internal ones.  I've added a pointer to struct pci_ops to struct pci_bus
   and all operations now go through function pointers contained in this
   structure and these functions are passed a pointer to struct pci_dev
   where they can access their private data.
	- pci_{read,write}_config_{byte,word,dword}() are now the only
	  official interface to configuration space access. They do
	  all checks and locking automatically.
	- pcibios_* functions are now just a compatibility glue kept
	  in compat.c and doing pci_find_slot and pci_*_config_*.
	- PCI bus probing is now controlled by the arch-dependent
	  code. pci_init() calls pcibios_init() which initializes
	  the low-level conf access code and calls pci_scan_bus()
	  for all the host buses it knows, passing bus number,
	  private data and pointer to struct pci_ops to it. Then
	  it does all the fixups needed, allocates resources
	  and returns back to pci_init() which initializes the rest.
o  Unified bug fixups: There are two tables of fixup hooks now -- a generic
   one in quirks.c and a arch-specific one. Each fixup entry contains
   vendor and device ID (can be PCI_ANY_ID), function pointer to call
   and it also specifies the time the fixup should be used -- either
   immediately after the configuration header is read [used especially
   for fixing up bogus headers] or during the normal fixup phase [when
   addresses are assigned and resources allocated].
o  names.c are compiled always, not only when modules are enabled.
o  Replaced all calls to pcibios_* in generic PCI code by their pci_* counterparts.
o  names.c: pci_namedevice renamed to pci_name_device and added to pci.h.
o  names.c: Use the bus:dev.func notation used everywhere else in the kernel.
o  Introduced pci_request_device() and pci_release_device() which should
   be used by all new drivers to allocate whole PCI devices instead
   of attempting to allocate the resource regions separately.
o  Added subsystem vendor and device ID to struct pci_dev since several
   drivers need to find their devices by these ID's.
o  "pci=..." options work again.
o  Synced configuration header declarations in pci.h with PCI specs version 2.2.
o  /proc/bus/pci/devices report region sizes as well.
o  Added macros PCI_REGION_* for easy manipulation with PCI resources.
o  pci_present now just tests that there are any PCI devices.
Still on my TODO list:
o  Repair all architectures broken by this patch.
o  Start fixing all drivers bitten by PCI / resource mgmt changes.
o  Remove enabling of expansion ROMs from IDE drivers.
o  ioctl() for setting of kernel view of IRQ's and addresses.
o  Do something with device naming and /proc/pci.
o  Create pci_find_subsystem().
o  Test automatic allocation of I/O ports.
o  Update Documentation/pci.txt.
o  Try compiling without PCI and without BIOS / direct access.
o  Fixups for broken S3 cards.
o  Register main RAM in resource manager and remove all the artificial
   bounds we use when allocating regions now.
o  Remove #if 0 around the AGP bridge fixup after checking it's correct.
o  Read all the PCI sources and search for bugs :-)
o  [maybe for 2.5] allow PCI drivers to register their init functions
   along with ID's of all devices they want passed.
