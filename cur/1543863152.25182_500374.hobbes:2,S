Damn you're right. It shocked me too and I know I was missing something
when replying but I did not remember what.

Yes, that's what I thought too. In the past, I've been having better
resolution with select() and real-time scheduling, but I cannot reliably
reproduce it, even on SMP. I remember nothing was running at all on the
machine (not even X) and that can make an important difference. But as
you say, there will be no guarantee of better accuracy anyway.

Hmmm the busy loop is dirty as hell, even on SMP, but it works ;-)
I remember is was possible to reprogram the RTC to interrupt at 8192 Hz.
If the task is running with real time prio, it should get this accuracy,
or am I mistaken ?

Thanks for those hints, I've been used to play with the reset button,
at least it has forced me to double check my code before running it :-)
