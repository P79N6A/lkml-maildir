Subject: Question about vfsmount test in __do_follow_link
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

In __do_follow_link I see
if (path->mnt == nd->mnt)
	mntget(path->mnt);
immediately before
cookie = dentry->d_inode->i_op->follow_link(dentry, nd);
I can't see the case where the vfsmount is ever different. This would have 
to mean a mount was followed but this shouldn't be possible for a 
symlink?
Can someone enlighten me?
Ian
