I've also noticed problems with 1 and 2, and I submitted a patch to
James that allocates resources on a per device basis instead of being
global and statically allocated.  This includes the cursor data
structures, cursor timer/vbl interrupt service, putcs buffer, and
optionally the softback buffer.  The last is probably not very important
for the present setup but may become useful later on (ie, multiple
active consoles).
As for synchronization, I was meaning to ask some pointers on that.  The
setup currently works like this:
                        (blink)
fbcon_cursor         fbcon_vbl_handler (interrupt or timer)

I was thinking of placing locks in accel_cursor and
fb_get_buffer_offset, but I'm not sure.

In the present cursor api, the driver just needs to draw/undraw the
cursor whether by software or hardware.  So the problem here is with
cursors that does it's own blinking, such as text modes.

The delay is only for the blinking.  After drawing a character/stream of
characters, an explicit "draw cursor" command immediately follows (I
think) via fbcon_cursor.
