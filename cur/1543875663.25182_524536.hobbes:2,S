Sounds like periodic SMM traps.  There's not much you can do about
them other than to avoid such hardware if you have tight RT
constraints.  The RTAI people have some code to disable SMM but it
does not work on all chipsets and may render some of your hardware
inoperable.
Is this a laptop?  They are plagued with SMM problems...
