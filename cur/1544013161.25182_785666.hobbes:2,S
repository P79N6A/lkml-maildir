It's probably not a bad idea. I'm not sure how big of a problem it 
actually is, though. As long as the filesystem is unmounted before 
unplug you'll probably be OK (unless you ripped out the cable/power so 
quickly afterwards that there was still data in the write cache).
Ideally before disconnecting a removable hard drive one should flush the 
write cache and park the heads (the latter being somewhat important for 
2.5" drives in order to avoid emergency head unloads that would reduce 
the life of the drive). I believe that there's a command one can echo 
into the sd driver in sysfs somewhere that will trigger this.. Therefore 
the right sequence would be:
-unmount filesystem
-remove SCSI disk (synchronize cache and stop unit)
-suspend SCSI device
Thing is that some USB storage devices don't support both of those 
commands (I've got a USB-to-IDE enclosure with a Genesys chipset that 
doesn't translate SCSI START STOP UNIT into an IDE Standby Immediate 
command as it really should, think it just throws "invalid field in CDB" 
errors). However if we've done the above we've really done the best we 
can do..
