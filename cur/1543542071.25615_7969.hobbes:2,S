That explains it.

LOADER_TYPE 49 is the identifier for syslinux.
from ldlinux.asm:
syslinux_id equ 031h    ; SYSLINUX (3) version 1.x (1)
At a glance, it looks like INITRD_SIZE is set wrong.
Please verify INITRD_START, and add INITRD_SIZE to your printk.
INITRD_START=3276800 means INITRD_SIZE=30249773.. and that doesn't
jibe with floppy ;-)  Here, syslinux always loads (16k aligned)
the initrd at top of memory and gets INITRD_SIZE right.

Try mem=31M for grins (hunch-o-meter says memory detection changes)
