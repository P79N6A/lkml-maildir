i've fixed a couple of minor, priority-related bugs in kernels post
-30-10, the latest being -31-7 - there's some chance that one of them
might fix this final anomaly.

there's one thing i noticed, now that the blocker device is in the
kernel, you have to be really careful to compile the userspace loop()
code via the same gcc flags as the kernel did. Minor differences in
compiler options can skew the timing calibration.
but any such bug should at most cause a linear deviation via a constant
factor multiplication, while the data shows a systematic nonlinear
transformation.

yeah, i agree that this has to be further investigated. What type of box
did you test it on - UP or SMP? (SMP scheduling of RT tasks only got
fully correct in the very latest -31-7 kernel.)
