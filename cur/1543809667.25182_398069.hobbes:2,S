this is racy - we cannot know whether the PID wrapped around.
nor does this method offer any solution for the case where there are 
already waiters pending: they might be hung forever. With our solution 
one of those waiters gets woken up and notice that the lock is dead. 
(and in the unlikely even of that thread dying too while trying to 
recover the data, the kernel will do yet another wakeup, of the next 
waiter.)
