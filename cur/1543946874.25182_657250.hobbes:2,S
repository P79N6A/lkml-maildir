Keep in mind there are also pending fixes in my net-2.6 tree which
Linus hasn't pulled in yet as well.
I watch Linus's tree closely, and I'll see any potential merge issue
long before it matters, and I always double check before pushing
stuff out to him.
My job as tree master is to deal with all the merge hassles, should
they occur.  But up until now everything networking has gone through
my tree and everything is fine.
The net-2.6 tree isn't even a week old.  I planned to pull Linus's
tree in right before I leave for a short trip tomorrow afternoon.
I'm really not being allowed to make that choice by how these
changes are being merged to me.
Heck, Jeff even thanked me for making my net-2.6 tree stable and not
rebasing, so his method of merging this stuff is doubly surprising for
me.
Jeff, I really don't want to pull that tree in.  Please trust me as
your upstream to handle merging issues, as needed.
Thanks!
