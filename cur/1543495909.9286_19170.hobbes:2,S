IMHO the kernels task is it to support an interface to hardware.
Regardless if this is a SCSI Controller, a Soundcard or a Grafics
Board. Kgicon (GGIs Kernel Drivers) is a collection of such drivers
and should go into the kernel during the 2.3.x development. But before
that can happen the Kgicon sourcetree should be modified so it can be
easily integrated into the kernel. At the moment its designed to be
a set of external modules to be loaded after system startup (like the
compleate PCMCIA stuff).

I don't see any reason for not integreating devfs! It works fine for me
since over a half year. ROCK Linux is compleatly based on DevFS since it's
based on 2.1.x/2.2.x Kernels and if some user doesn't like it for some
reason he/she is not forced to use it! Other UNIXes are allready going
this way of a "virtual /dev filesystem" and I don't see any disadvantages
except that a few packages need to be patched. DevFS is a Cool Thing !!
Have a look at 
http://linux-patches.rock-projects.com/
 for more patches
waiting to be intergrated into the linux kernel.
