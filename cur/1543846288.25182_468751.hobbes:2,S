On some platforms, including sparc64, asm/signal.h needs
compat_sigset_t, but this is defined in linux/compat.h
after asm/signal.h is included.
Andrew, aren't you doing sparc64 cross builds these days? :-)
This came from 3f2e05e90e0846c42626e3d272454f26be34a1bc
    [PATCH] BLOCK: Revert patch to hack around undeclared sigset_t in linux/compat.h
    Revert Andrew Morton's patch to temporarily hack around the lack of a
    declaration of sigset_t in linux/compat.h to make the block-disablement
    patches build on IA64.  This got accidentally pushed to Linus and should
    be fixed in a different manner.
    Also make linux/compat.h #include asm/signal.h to gain a definition of
    sigset_t so that it can externally declare sigset_from_compat().
    This has been compile-tested for i386, x86_64, ia64, mips, mips64, frv, ppc and
    ppc64 and run-tested on frv.

It figures that one of the platforms it wasn't compile tested on is
the one that breaks :-)
