Hello,
new reiser4 snapshot against 2.6.3 kernel is available at
http://www.namesys.com/snapshots/2004.02.25
It contains bug fixes and stability improvements. On-disk format is
compatible with the previous snapshot. Also,
  * raid0 preliminary support, and
  * improved loop back support
were added.
In "standard" configuration reiser4 is stable except for a multiple umount/mount 
issue we are still analyzing. See the READ.ME file for not-well-supported 
features and options.
Hopefully our next snapshot will be ready for inclusion, and hopefully it is 
just a few days away.
