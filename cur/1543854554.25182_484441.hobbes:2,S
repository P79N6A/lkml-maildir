That sounds unduly complicated compared to just using the GPIO numbers
which are used throughout the hardware and software docs.  It'd also
be a big (and needless) disruption to code that's been working fine for
several years now ... and there'd need to be some scheme to recognize
that most GPIO numbers suddenly become invalid (since the space would
become large and sparsely populated, vs small and dense).
Maybe if it were being done over from scratch, that'd be workable.
But at this point I have a hard time seeing anyone want to change,
even if there were a better argument.

Pin muxing is set up once, early, and from then on it suffices to use
the GPIO number.  The mux problems are orthogonal to GPIOs.

Updating the GPIO controller is always (all architectures!) done in terms
of a number mapping to some controller and a bit number, not a pin.  The
drivers never care about pins.
The only thing that cares about pins is board setup code -- briefly.
