Actually, the opposite is what I've seen and also had other people
claim.
VIA apparently when asked about this quirk (this wasn't by me, I have
no current contacts there and they've been very quiet here) responded
"use ACPI".
FWIW, I have very similar hardware to what's in the bug report and it
works w/ ACPI just fine.
