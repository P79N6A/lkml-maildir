Apparently I missed that several drivers also use bd->sem so they need
to be converted too... But what is it with the drivers:
static void aty128_bl_set_power(struct fb_info *info, int power)
{
        mutex_lock(&info->bl_mutex);
        up(&info->bl_dev->sem);
        info->bl_dev->props->power = power;
        __aty128_bl_update_status(info->bl_dev);
        down(&info->bl_dev->sem);
        mutex_unlock(&info->bl_mutex);
}
Why we are doing up() before down()??? And it is in almost every
driver that uses backlight... Do I need more coffee? [CC-ing bunch of
people trying to get an answer...]
