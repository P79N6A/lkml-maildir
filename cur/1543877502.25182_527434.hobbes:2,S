Let's try to avoid consuming another page flag if poss, please.  Perhaps
use PAGE_MAPPING_ANON's neighbouring bit?

um, OK.  I suspect it would be good to clear the page's
PageWhateverWereGoingToCallThisThing() state when this happens.  Otherwise
when the page gets clean again (ie: added to swapcache then written out)
then it will look awfully similar to one of these new types of pages and
things might get confusing.  We'll see.
