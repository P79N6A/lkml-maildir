But a directory *is* a file! The difference is:
    1. It has a *directory* attribute
    2. It has a *defined* format
Don't forget *nix has *other* attributes also. So, exactly what 
is the problem with adding *another* attribute? Why *not* just 
define a new extended attribute "directory" with a defined 
format?
