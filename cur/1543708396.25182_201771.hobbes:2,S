[sorry for the blatant crosspost]
In reference to:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/kernel/msg239561.html
I'm running linux 2.6.3-bk5 and in my /sys/class/input/mouse* and event*
directories i only have one file 'dev'.  There are no 'device' and
'driver' symlinks.
Most people I've asked about this only have 'dev'.  I've found one
person who has the other files in place but I can't determine what's
different about our setups.
Is there maybe a patch I'm missing.
I'm not on the list so please direct replies to me directly.
Thanks,
Ryan
