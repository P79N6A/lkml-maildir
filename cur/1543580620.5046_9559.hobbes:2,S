Linus basically designed the original kiobuf scheme of course so I guess
he's allowed to dislike it. Linus disliking something however doesn't mean
its wrong. Its not a technically valid basis for argument.
Linus list of reasons like the amount of state are more interesting

Networking wants something lighter rather than heavier. Adding tons of
base/limit pairs to kiobufs makes it worse not better
