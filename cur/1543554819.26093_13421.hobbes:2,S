This is a point I don't understand here : do you mean that they are
confused if they can rmdir "." but not if they can rmdir their cwd
differently ? What's the difference ?
I am not saying that rmdir MUST be allowed on "." ; I just suggested that
it be allowed _because_ you can rmdir your cwd anyway. Now if rmdir "." is
forbidden, then I think rmdir `pwd` should fail as well. Or am I missing
something ?
