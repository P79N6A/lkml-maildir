Now we've already sunken to the toilet level... :-(

Alan, you're making things up without any proof.
Listening to this diatribe against static tracepoints, one could get idea 
they would be something alien, which would polute the source. Well, 
everything can be abused, but good tracepoints are like good 
documentation, nobody wants to write and maintain it, but in the end 
others benefit from it if it exists.
