Fixing OOM handling is still on the TODO list for the new
VM.
Integrating the fix is trivial and will be done when the
bugs in the current features have been found and fixed.
(we're close on that one ... now that there are a lot more
testers we found a few new ones and I have a stable VM on
my laptop that needs to be merged with Linus' latest tree,
expect a patch soon)
[the only current problem is that I have the flu and it's
hard to concentrate]
regards,
Rik
