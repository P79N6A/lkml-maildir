An issue I noticed the other day is that we really should be turning
on CONFIG_IDEPCI_SHARE_IRQ whenever CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SGIIOC4 is selected.
The IOC4 IDE part shares a PCI interrupt with the other IOC4 devices
(serial, external interrupts), so it is effectively always sharing an
IRQ.
I just haven't created the patch yet, and will be out of the office
until next Tuesday.  You might want to consider fixing this side-issue
as well as long as you're touching the IOC4 IDE code.
