And interrupt happens in the context of another process. So? What did you
expect? Interrupts. Can. Not. Access. User. Address. Space. On any UNIX.

If you are translating it to the kernel space address - you'ld better tell
the kernel to keep whatever is mapped there in place. Which mlock() does.
You should not do that. Really. Use mmap() instead of those tricks. Let
the driver allocate a page and modify it. Let the process ask for this
page being mapped to its address space. No problems, no mlock(), no
playing with address translation.
