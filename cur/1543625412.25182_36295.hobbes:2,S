I was hoping for some feedback regarding the use of BUG(). I have
been experimenting with the patch - changing various bitmasks to 
use this new datatype. None of them do the error checking that I am
adding. Is it worth the overhead to have these checks at all? If
they ever trigger, they are indicative of an error elsewhere in the
kernel...
With respect to the for loops: For CPUMAP_SIZE > 1, most of the
interfaces expand to a "for loop". This is a performance vs. bloat
tradeoff. The "for-loop" versions of the functions _could_ be moved
to a cpumap.c file under lib. Is this the recommended approach?
The cpumap_format() function below is probably the worst offender.
There is no real performance value in making it an inline function...
