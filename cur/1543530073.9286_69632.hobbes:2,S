I've Cc:ed this to the nfsv4 working group as well.
Maybe I can shed a bit of light.
knfsd cannot just used dentries (internal structures accessed by path
name) to talk to reiserfs as NFS requires it to use "file handles"
which have a maximum length.  To support NFSv2 or v3 you will need to
provide a way to map from a fix-size identifier to a file, that is
stable across rename, write, truncate, reboot.
The volatile filehandles of NFSv4 aim to get around this restriction,
and if you will (one day) be happy to only support NFSv4, not v2 or v3
(once the spec if finalised and the implementations are done and
clients are common...)  then you have more flexability in talking to
NFS.
The NFS client only *needs* a file handle to be stable while it has
the file open.  Having it stable while the client does not have the
file open is at best a convenience for caching.
NFSv4 allows the client to "open" and subsequently "close" a file -
abstractions that absent from NFSv2,3.
NFSv4 allows the server to assert that file handles are stable
(non-volatile, persistant) while a file is open, but that it will
provide no guarantees at other times.
This can work quite well for an MSDOS style filesystem which can use
filehandles based on the file name (E.g. disc address of directory
entry) and which disallows hard links, and disallows unlink or rename
while a file is open.
This should be able to be made to work fairly well for reiserfs too.
As I understand reiserfs (which isn't very deeply), it has an emphasis
on efficient support for lots of small files, and so likes to keep
meta-data and some or all of the data associated with a file in the
directory entry that references the file.
I can imaging that this would mean changing the size of the file,
renaming the file, or even adding files to the directory could all
change the physical location of the meta-data on disc, making it hard
to have a fixed-length, stable index to a file, as needed by NFSv2,3.
A simple minded approach to providing presistant-only-when-open
file handles for reiserfs might be to allocate sequential file handles
and to keep a cache of "filehandle to metadata-disc-address"
mappings. This cache would have to be kept up-to-date whenever a file's
metadata moved.
When a file was opened, the mapping would be marked as 'persistant'
and be logged to stable storage.  On the last close, the mapping could
have the presistant flag removed.
Then the cache could be regularly cleaned of non-persistant mappings,
in an LRU fashion, and any filehandle that is presented which is not
in the cache gets an "NFS4ERR_FHEXPIRED" response.
The logging to stable storage is required so that in the event of a
reboot, the server will still honour open file handles.
As this approach requires logging all opens to disc, it is very likely
to be a performance nightmare.
If we can assume that while the disc address of metadata can change,
it doesn't change very often, then a suitable alternative might be:
- Store a uniquifier in the metadata for each file - an essentally
  random 32-64 bit number.
- Make file handles out of disc-address+uniquifier.
- When an open file has the disc address of its metadata changed, cache
  the old filehandle and the new address both in memory and on stable
  storage.
Then, when a file handle is received, first check the cache.  If it
isn't there, check to see if valid metadata exists at the disc address
and has the given uniquifier.  If it doesn't only then give a
NFS4ERR_FHEXPIRED.
On reboot, you would need to prime the cache from the stable-storage
log.
This should provide the client with the stability it needs, and not
incur too much performance overhead (or does the address of metadata
change a lot?)
I would like the server to be able to tell the client that a
filehandle needs to be updated, and for the client to be able to ask
for an updated copy of a given filehandle - so that entries in the
old-to-new cache could be discarded even while a file was still open,
but that proposal wasn't accepted (yet).
