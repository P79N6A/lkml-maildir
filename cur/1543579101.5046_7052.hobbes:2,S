Subject: Overriding BIOS settings with kernel 2.4.0

Hi,
	I'm runing Linux kernel 2.4.0 on a AMD Thunderbird 700, AOPEN AK33
(KT133 chipset). I have a SB Live, PCI NE2000 Network adapter, Adaptec
AHA-2940UW, a TV Capture card and an AGP Geforce 256.
	I'm telling you all this because my BIOS keeps assigning shared
interrupts between the Geforce-TVCapture and NE2000-USB Hubs. I get
several messages at boot time complaining about shared IRQ's. The funny
thing is that I have at least 2 free IRQ's, but my BIOS won't assign them
to any device... :-?
	Is there any way to get Linux override BIOS settings and reassign
IRQ's so they aren't shared by more than one device?
	Thanks
		Julian J. M.
