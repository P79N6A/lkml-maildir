I just accidentally deleted all the messages about uptime including
the code sent to me to test to see if it was a user-mode problem.
It seems to be a user-mode problem:

# cat >xxx.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/sysinfo.h>
struct sysinfo info;
#define SECS_MIN 60
#define SECS_HR (SECS_MIN * 60)
#define SECS_DAY (SECS_HR * 24)
int main(void) {
        long uptime;
        long days, hrs, min, sec;
        sysinfo(&info);
        printf("uptime: %ld sec\n", info.uptime);
        uptime  = info.uptime;
        days    = info.uptime / SECS_DAY;
        uptime -= (days * SECS_DAY);
        hrs     = uptime / SECS_HR;
        uptime -= (hrs * SECS_HR);
        min     = uptime / SECS_MIN;
        sec     = uptime - (min * SECS_MIN);
        printf("uptime %ldd %02ld:%02ld:%02ld\n", days, hrs, min, sec);
        return(0);
}

Hand-made 'uptime' shows more than 128 days.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
