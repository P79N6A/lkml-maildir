right.  and just for posterity, let me note here that 
the K7-specific kernel code IS NOT KNOWN TO BE BUGGY.
the best and so far only explanation is that since CONFIG_MK7 
can *triple* the bandwidth that Linux demands of dram, 
marginal hardware is pushed over the edge.  stable hardware
has no problem with the code, and the code follows AMD's specs.
turning off the optimizations is just de-tuning the kernel
to pander to (work around) flakey hardware.
