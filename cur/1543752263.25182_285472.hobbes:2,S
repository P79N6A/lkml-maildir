Ahh. Good catch, silly me. No toggling, so you can ignore my last post. 
There's no cycle going on, and the ports are stable, and the interrupt is 
coming from somewhere else entirely.
You could still enable debugging, but at that point I'd actually be 
interested in the _first_ part of the debug output, not the long tail of 
dead interrupts. You'd need a serial console or netconsole to catch it, 
I'm afraid.
