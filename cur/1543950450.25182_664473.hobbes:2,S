Ok, it's not equivalent. We have two sizes: object size (8 bytes) and 
buffer size (32 bytes) here. In netfilter, ->real_len is same as object 
size, not buffer size as ksize() is.
But now I am officially even more confused, why does the netfilter code 
decided whether to reallocate based on _object size_ and not _buffer size_ 
(as krealloc() does, for example)?
