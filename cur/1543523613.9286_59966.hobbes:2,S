Yes. So we know that it's not hung waiting for the alias to disappear.

At the top of the file, line 179, you will see a routine called
prtchr. It prints a character in the AL register. Just ahead of
it is prtstr, it prints a string, but don't use it because you
have to set the DS register, restore it later, etc.
Just, moving through the code, do:
		mov 0x30, al    # ASCII '0'
		call prtchr
		.... more code, possible hung loops
		mov 0x31, al	# ASCII '1'
		call prtchr
... etc.
You will have 0123 on the screen if it hangs between '3' and '4'.
Easy! Have fun.
