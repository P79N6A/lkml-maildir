OK. I'll try reverting that one too. I'm inclined to agree that it could be
the problem, because I noticed one more thing before I rebooted to 2.6.0-test6.
I recently installed the latest RH9 hotplug packages from the hotplug Sourceforge
website. Under 2.6.0-test6-mm1 the hotplug initscript leaves a defunct hotplug
process along with the other events/0 defunct processes. Does this mean anything?
The hotplug version is hotplug-2003_08_05-1.
