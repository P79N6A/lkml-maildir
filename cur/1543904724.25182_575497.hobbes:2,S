I have a number of SK-9844 "SK-NET GE-SX dual link" cards.  skge has never 
worked with the cards.
The following sequence locks up the machine completely (power cycle to get 
it back) with 2.6.22.1:
fresno:~# modprobe skge
fresno:~# ip li set eth2 up
fresno:~# ip li set eth2 down
fresno:~# ip li set eth3 up
This works just fine:
fresno:~# rmmod skge
fresno:~# modprobe sk98lin RlmtMode=DualNet
fresno:~# ip li set eth2 up
fresno:~# ip li set eth2 down
fresno:~# ip li set eth3 up
fresno:~# ip li set eth3 down
eth2 and eth3 are ports off the sk-9844.
I've been reporting the problem since March.  If sk98lin is removed, I 
won't have networking.
