Actually the whole mess stems from our broken internal ->write() and
->read() APIs.
The _single_ return value is trying to convery _two_ pieces of information
- always a bad move. They are:
1) Success/failure (and error code if it's a failure)
2) Amount of bytes read or written
This bogon does not allow for the following information to be returned
(assume I asked for 8192 bytes to be written):
"4096 bytes were written, and the operation was aborted due to EINTR"
Cheers
