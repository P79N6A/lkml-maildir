I'd like to thank Larry for his assistance today.  Being behind a company
firewall with no outbound ssh port access, pushing stuff to bkbits.net
wasn't working.  He opened up a second ssh port (2222) on bkbits.net that
isn't generally blocked, and now I can push there.
BK_RSH="ssh -p 2222" bk push bk://project.bkbits.net/repository
Thanks!
Matt
