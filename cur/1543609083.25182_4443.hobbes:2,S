This limitation has been introduced since allowing extended user
attributes for special files leads to an awkward semantic mess: Extended
user attributes are in a sense treaded like file contents (concerning
permissions, for example). Now the "contents" of a special file are a
device, really. The device isn't even located on the filesystem the
special file is on. And the device doesn't have extended attributes.
It is possible to have devices on read-only file systems, which are
readable and writeable. It would not be possible to have extended
attributes in that case.

I am not sure about this. Just note that XFS and current ext2/ext3 don't
yet have the owner and trusted namespaces.
