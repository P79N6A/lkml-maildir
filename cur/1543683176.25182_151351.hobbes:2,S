Hmm.. I don't have a 22-pre7 tree handy, what's the relevant reference in
drivers/usb/Makefile look like?  I'm guessing a missing 'ifeq' or
obj-$(CONFIG_mumble) in there, so speedtch.o gets build even if the
required flags aren't set?
Other possibility is a missing EXPORT_SYMBOL() that's horquing things up
if you have CONFIG_ATM=m rather than y? (Yes, I know it's a 'bool' in net/Config.in,
doesn't mean you can't get an 'm' in there anyhow. ;)
