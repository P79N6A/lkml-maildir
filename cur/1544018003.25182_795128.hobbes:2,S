Hm, GCC uses __restrict__, right?
The patch below makes no difference at all on an x86 defconfig:
  vmlinux:
     text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  7253544	1641812	1324296	10219652	 9bf084	vmlinux.before
  7253544	1641812	1324296	10219652	 9bf084	vmlinux.after
not a single instruction was changed:
 --- vmlinux.before.asm
 +++ vmlinux.after.asm
 @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
 
 -vmlinux.before:     file format elf64-x86-64
 +vmlinux.after:     file format elf64-x86-64
I'm wondering whether there's any internal tie-up between alias analysis 
and the __restrict__ keyword - so if we turn off aliasing optimizations 
the __restrict__ keyword's optimizations are turned off as well.
Nope, with aliasing optimizations turned back on there's still no change 
on the x86 defconfig:
     text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  7240893	1641796	1324296	10206985	 9bbf09	vmlinux.before
  7240893	1641796	1324296	10206985	 9bbf09	vmlinux.after
GCC 4.3.2. Maybe i missed something obvious?
