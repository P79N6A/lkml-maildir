I've seen patches like this before.  I'm generally in favour of removing
the unnecessary test, but Linus rejected it on the grounds the compiler
shouldn't be warning about it and it's better to be more explicit about
the range test.  Maybe he's changed his mind between then and now ;-)

conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
