lm90 (all sensors chips have approximately the same speed, right?) spec says:
"It takes the LM90 31.25 ms to measure the temperature of the remote diod and
internal diode". Google says: "The buses [I2C, SMBus] operate at the same
speed, up to 100kHz, but the I2C bus has both 400kHz and 2MHz versions."
What I'm trying to say that you shouldn't care about s/cmp; jcc/call/ if the
actual measurement is infinite from CPU's POV.

Well, yes, I agree that initialization will become slower. But how long is
register read (from first outb command to the moment when CPU sees it)?
I'm trying to build time hierarchy of things we're discussing in my head.
