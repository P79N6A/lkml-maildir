26 Feb 2001:
Rebuilt the kernel to version 2.4.2-ac4, to include the latest tulip patches.
The performance is better,  but it is still not quite right; this time it 
received just over 48 MBytes before hanging :-(
Using a 3C590B card on Friday, I ran IPTRAF for about 6 hours, and several 
GBytes of data with no problems at all.  Unfortunately I have only one such 
card available, and our suppliers are quoting mid-March for delivery.
