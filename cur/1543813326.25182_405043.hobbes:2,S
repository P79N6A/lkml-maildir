	Yes, you do. You can receive a copy of the Linux kernel without paying any
fee or agreeing to any license. You do in fact give away the software for
free.
> we give it away under the
> terms of the GPL,
	That is true. However, the GPL can only grant additional rights, it cannot
take any away.
> you must abide by the terms of the GPL to use it.
	No, that's not true. The law permits the normal expected use simply by
acquiring a copy of the work lawfully. Otherwise, you could buy a book and
then discover that you still had to pay a royalty to read it. Or you could
put a poem on a billboard and sue anyone who read it.
> that is the law, you can wish it wasn't but it is.
	You might try *reading* the law sometime.
	DS
