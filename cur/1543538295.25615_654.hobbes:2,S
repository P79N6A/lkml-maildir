Is it possible to use the IDE interface on a Sound Blaster Live
PnP card as a third IDE interface?  If so, is it automatically
configured, or is some lilo magic needed?  Does the card need to
be tweaked via ISAPnP first, or will it just work?
Any info or URL pointers would be greatly appreciated.

I've overclocked my keyboard interface.  It's quite messy dipping my
hands into the mineral oil, but *MAN* is my keyboard ever fast now!
