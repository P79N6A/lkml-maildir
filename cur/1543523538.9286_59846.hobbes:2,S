Well I've installed kernel 2.3.40, and the issue seems to be resolved.
After a bit of further testing, I found that turning off ACPI had no effect
on wether or not kernel 2.2.14 'saw' all of the RAM. Enabling or disabling
ECC parity checking in the BIOS also did not change the results.
Kernel 2.3.40 seems to function properly regardless of wether ECC/ACPI
are enabled or disabled in the BIOS.
In regards to Mark Hanh:

The dimms 'look' just fine :). My first guess was that the memory was 
flackey. I had been previously using non-ECC memory, so I switched.
Seeing the same problem leads me to believe it's not the RAM.
I had also replaced the motherboard to no effect, so it has to be the
kernel as far as I can figure out.
With the experimental kernel, everything seems to be operating normally,
a few quick checks seem to indicate that the machine is stable, and I'll
be running some benchmarks to see how it's performing, but preliminary
tests seem to indicate that it's blazing fast :)
I'm unfortunately not very familiar with programming/debugging in C, 
so I'm fairly inept at figuring out exactly what went wrong, but if
someone wants to try to figure it out I'm more than willing to give
access to the box if you need a test environment or a live demonstration
of the problem.
Also, if you know what's causing the problem, or how to fix it, please
email me, as I'm not on the mailing list.
