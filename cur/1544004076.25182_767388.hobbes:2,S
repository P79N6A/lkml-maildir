Well.  That would be a desirable objective.  I can understand the
reasons for taking the easy way out.  Given that Tomoyo doesn't seem to
ever free memory again, one hopes that this function doesn't get called
a lot, so the performance impact of zeroing out all that memory should
be negligible.
I think.  Maybe I misinterpreted tmy_alloc(), and perhaps it _is_
called frequently?

It should apply.  It's not so much a matter of rules and regulations. 
One needs to look at the underlying _reasons_ why those rules came
about.  We got ourselves into a sticky mess with procfs with all sorts
of ad-hoc data presentation and input formatting.  It's inconsistent,
complex, makes tool writing harder, etc.
So we recognised our mistakes and when sysfs (otherwise known as procfs
V2 :)) came about we decided that sysfs files should not make the same
mistakes.
So, logically, that thinking should apply to all new pseudo-fs files. 
Even, in fact, ones which are in /proc!
