The symptom is _different_ than without the patch being applied?  That
should be impossible.  With Kernel Debugging disabled, the patch should
have zero effect.. you should have your original oops back.
Anyway, it boots fine with ikd:foo enabled, so what's different from
stock kernel.  Frame-pointers?.. no way in hell.  Linking?..

If you edit arch/i386/vmlinux.lds in test8-virgin and just delete..
 /* Sections to be discarded */
 /DISCARD/ : {
 *(.text.exit)
 *(.data.exit)
 *(.exitcall.exit)
 }
..do your symptoms change?

OK, I'd feel better about it if you had a functional linux install
with _any_ kernel version, but I doubt the hw is totally busted.
