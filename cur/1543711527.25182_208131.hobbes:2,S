Well, limiting the 'work to do' to one CPU is exactly what I need to do,
the code must not run on another CPU at the same time.
If just a 'flag' is used, it is possible to loose an event, the flag like in
queue_work() prevents from running twice only.
But if the first work is just finished and about to reset the flag, the
check for the flag in the second CPU results to do nothing and a possible
needed work is not done.
The idea of using an atomic counter instead of the semaphore is for
performance reasons. It's better if the second work-to-do just increments
a counter, which the first work handles afterwards, than put this thread to
sleep.
