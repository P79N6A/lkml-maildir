Sort of. We have a problem about consistently reporting which device. So
dev_printk(dev, ...) is printk that formats up the device info for you.
Its also easy to use and happens to pass a device pointer into the
places you want it for more detailed logging

I'm trying to make sure the right data is available. I don't *care* what
you do with it after it gets thrown at you. If I have to care what you
are doing with the data the interface is wrong.

Who cares. Migrate the devices you care about one at a time, test them
and worry about just those. Do you need 120 highly available network
card drivers. Do you need telco grade soundblaster 16 ?

We don't. We add an extra helper that builds on it in a totally logical
fashion. The existing one doesnt break, its merely something to be
polished when needed by the folks who care

And dev_printk is going to be under 1K. What you do with the data isnt
my problem.

Again, this is about what you do with the data for your cases.
dev_printk is about making the info available cleanly

For core code changes for 2.6 base Linus tree. So you end up with a set
of patches you add over time. I would note however that the default
dev_printk() routine that just reformats up as
<level>%s: message
is not exactly taxing to get into 2.5 before October 31st, being about
10 lines long. That gives you the infrastructure to know what is going
on. Similarly I don't think its infeasible to get the state interface
into the base kernel just flipping flags in the device structure.
That makes it easy to add the needed pieces to base kernel code during
the driver work after Oct 31st, but without having to import all the
event logging stuff which wants hammering out over a longer period of
time
