No, the hardware seems to work perfectly.
We just have a software issue.  We *know* it's only software
because rmmod+modprobe fixes things, without any hardware intervention.
I believe the code is leaning too heavily on the BIOS for stuff,
and like lots of other parts of the kernel we'll need an alternate
strategy for when things aren't "perfect".

The machine already has the latest BIOS, thanks.
