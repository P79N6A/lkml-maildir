It doesn't matter how "hard" it was to write that code. What matters
is whether your code requires enough copyrighted aspects of the
original work to constitute as derived work. There's a huge difference
between using kmalloc and spin_lock and writing a driver that is built
on to of the full USB stack of Linux kernel, for example.
