It wasn't _that_ bad, the main issue really was that it was interferring
with the cfq slices and you didn't get really good aggregate throughput
for several threads. Once that happens, there's the nasty tendency for
both latency to rise and throughput to plummit quickly :-)
I cap the depth at a variable setting right now, so no more than 4 by
default.

Well, or have the user give a profile of the drive. There's no point in
attempting to guess things the user knows. And then there are things you
probably cannot get right in either case :)

And move some code to user space.

Always, we should of course run as well as we can without magic disk
programs being needed.
