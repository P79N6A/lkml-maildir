	Michael Rothwell kindly pointed out to me in private mail that
I SCREWED UP (he didn't say that, I did) the copy-and-past on one of
the command lines and left out a "little detail"...

	This should have been:
	modprobe ip_masq_ftp
	ipchains -A forward -p tcp -s {Source Addresses} -d 0/0 21 -j MASQ
	DOH!  Sorry!
