Originally sent to the maintainer of the i386 math-emu code
(billm@suburbia.net) but that mail was bounced[1].  Is anybody
maintaining the math-emu code and do we even care about it anymore?
I am doing static code analysis on the kernel and have found a stack
imbalance in arch/i386/math-emu/wm_sqrt.S.  2.6.23-rc2, but it has
probably been there for a while.
    The code starts off with
        pushl   %ebp
        movl    %esp,%ebp
#ifndef NON_REENTRANT_FPU
        subl    $28,%esp
#endif /* NON_REENTRANT_FPU */
        pushl   %esi
        pushl   %edi
        pushl   %ebx
    At this point, the code is using 0x2c bytes of stack space.
    .... do some work
sqrt_stage_2_finish:
	sarl	$1,%ecx		/* divide by 2 */
	rcrl	$1,%eax
	/* Form the new estimate in %esi:%edi */
	movl	%eax,%edi
	addl	%ecx,%esi
	jnz	sqrt_stage_2_done	/* result should be [1..2) */
    ... still using 0x2c bytes of stack space
#ifdef PARANOID
/* It should be possible to get here only if the arg is ffff....ffff */
	cmp	$0xffffffff,FPU_fsqrt_arg_1
	jnz	sqrt_stage_2_error
#endif /* PARANOID */
/* The best rounded result. */
	xorl	%eax,%eax
	decl	%eax
	movl	%eax,%edi
	movl	%eax,%esi
	movl	$0x7fffffff,%eax
	jmp	sqrt_round_result
#ifdef PARANOID
sqrt_stage_2_error:
    .... 0x2c bytes of stack space
	pushl	EX_INTERNAL|0x213
    .... 0x30 bytes of stack space
	call	EXCEPTION
    .... EXCEPTION is FPU_exception which only aborts if __DEBUG__ is
    defined, __DEBUG__ is not defined.  So FPU_exception will return
    and we still have 0x30 bytes of stack used.  But the code drops
    through to sqrt_stage_2_done which (like the rest of the code) only
    expects 0x2c bytes of stack ===>  stack imbalance.
#endif /* PARANOID */ 
sqrt_stage_2_done:
The obvious fix is to add 'pop %eax' after 'call EXCEPTION' which will
remove the extra word from the stack.  Alas that only fixes the stack
imbalance, but does it even make sense for the code to continue after
calling EXCEPTION?
