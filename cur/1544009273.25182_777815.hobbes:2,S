This issue has been tracked down to be at the openchrome driver. It appears 
that somehow it corrupted the PCI bus, and damaged the device right after the 
video card - the wireless card. 
The current workaround for this is here - 
http://wiki.openchrome.org/pipermail/openchrome-devel/2008-November/000139.html
 - 
but this is just a quick hack, not a fix, although it works great for me. The 
openchrome team is working on a patch based on this.
Thanks for all the help - I am a very happy HP2133 user, and a very happy 
community member. This was an amazing opensource support experience, which 
I'll remember for a long time. Thank you all!
Cheers,
