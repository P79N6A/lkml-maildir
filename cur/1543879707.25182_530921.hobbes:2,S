Hm, this is strange. IIRC, the refmiscinfo version tag is imposed by the docbook
xsl stylesheets for manpages, see
http://www.oasis-open.org/archives/docbook-apps/200508/msg00111.html
 and
especially the 'man'-section, subsection 'extra2 field.' According to it, 
the stylesheets check several different locations for version info to be put in
the left footer position in the manpage, and if none is found, they simply state
that there's no version info, so this is not an error message but simply a
notification which, if nothing else, annoys while building the mandocs.
The URL cites the changelog of docbook-xsl 1.69.1 and this is also the
version in SLED 10 you're using so you should be getting this, too. I'll
try to dig deeper into this. The relevant packs I use are docbook-xsl:
1.72.0.dfsg.1-1, xmlto: 0.0.18-5.1 on debian unstable.
