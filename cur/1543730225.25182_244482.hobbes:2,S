I have started having problems resuming my laptop (a thinkpad t41p)
from apm-induced sleep. Suspension occurs after a longer period of
time than with working kernels, and resume never completes. the fans
come back on and the backlight turns on, but the system never
returns. It is unresponsive to sysrq keys, and eventually requires a
power cycle.  This problem started happening between 2.6.8-rc3-mm2 and
2.6.8.1-mm1. 2.6.8.1-mm4 still exhibits this problem. I am building
a vanilla 2.6.8.1 kernel now to try out now. I saw the issue with
yenta socket problems, so i disabled that support in the mm4 kernel,
to no avail. I realize that this isn't too much data to go on, but
would appreciate any suggestions.
