Hello,
	Some people might be aware of Zeta linux, an academic project of creating a 
virtual architecture, and porting binutils+gcc+linux to it. There have been 
already  three releases this year (0.3, 0.4 and today, 0.5).
	Quick outplot :
	* Graphical interface for the emulator, with a (simple) page tables browser.
	* the kernel almost boots up to the start of a userspace process.
	* use binutils-2.17, gcc-4.1.1 and linux-2.6.17.
	Everything you want to know about it is on 
http://orzel.freehackers.org/zeta
	This is of interest mostly to people who, like me, want to know more about 
the toolchain internals and linux core stuff internals (== not drivers, 
subsystems or filesystems).
	The next release will focus on writing the handbook (documentation, howto's, 
specifications..).
best regards,
Thomas
