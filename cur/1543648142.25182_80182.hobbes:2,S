Please not right now? ;-)  At least introduce it as aio_readv/aio_writev 
as currently the way we deal with iovecs uglifies a lot of code, with no 
benefit for the vast majority of applications.  As for killing 
generic_file_read/write and using the aio counterparts, that is the plan 
pending a bit more testing of things.  I want to get there step by step 
without breaking everything along the way.
