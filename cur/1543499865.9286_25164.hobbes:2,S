Hi,
sorry for sending an Off-Topic mail to this list. I send this to this list
becouse here are the high skilled Linux Users.
I'm maintaining "ROCK Linux". It's a Distribution with the focus on high
skilled Users: No configuration utility (use the config files luke, be one
with the config files). Based on Glibc 2.1.1 and the Kernel 2.2.10. It is
the first distribution which is using Richard's devfs (AFAIK). It is a
small distribution, but it's not a "mini distribution". It comes with over
200 Packages including X11 and the GNOME Desktop.
Have a look at it:

yours,
