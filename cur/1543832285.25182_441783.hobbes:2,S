Yep. This has been seen where a large number of ticks are lost. Roman
and I are working on a solution for this (I sent a patch out to the list
earlier today for it, and Roman *just* posted his version a moment ago -
if you can give one or both of them a try it would be appreciated).

Did you really mean jumps of 200 seconds? Hmmm. The issue Roman and I
have been looking into does occur when we lose a number of ticks and
that confuses the clocksource adjustment code. The fix we're working on
corrects the adjustment confusion, but doesn't fix the lost ticks.
However 200 seconds of lost ticks sounds very off. Could the driver be
disabling interrupt for such a long period of time?

I appreciate the report and apologize for the trouble.
thanks
