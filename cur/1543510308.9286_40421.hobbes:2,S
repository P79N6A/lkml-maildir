I have a Logitech mouse ( Model# M-BA47 ) that I am have problems
setting up the scroll wheel on.  I checked to see if there was any input
from the mouse wheel with cat /dev/mouse but found input from everything
but the wheel.  I had a old logitech mouse that had no problems ( Model#
M-C48). The new mouse did work with the old 2.0 kernels.  I would like
it if somebody could help me out with this.
