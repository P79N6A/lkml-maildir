Untrue what ? The persistence after plug out/in ?
The problem here is not to give the same interface to a given NIC. The
problem is to give the same options to a given NIC. But a solution can
simply be to set the option from hotplug using the proc interface. The
3c59x doesn't support that for wol but that can be changed.

This is an implementation issue which is not really important. It comes
from Donald Becker. Your dynamic structure doesn't solve the problem
'which options for which cards', does it ?
