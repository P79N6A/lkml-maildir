as a long time linux user I tend to not to use the framebuffer, but 
instead use the standard vga text drivers (with X and sometimes dri/drm).
in part this dates back to my early experiances with the framebuffer code 
when it was first introduced, but I still find that the framebuffer is not 
as nice to use as the simpler direct access for text modes. and when I 
start X up it doesn't need a framebuffer, so why suffer with the 
performance hit of the framebuffer?
yes, some hardware requires a framebuffer to display anything, but for 
most video cards, the hardware scrolling of a pure text mode is better 
(faster, smoother, less cpu required, etc) then the framebuffer 
equivalent.
