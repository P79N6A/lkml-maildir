commit d8a0be6ab7ba1ffa43e7ea0dcdde3e8b68d4f762 upstream.
Fix problem that deleting multiple logical drives could cause a panic.
It fixes a panic which can be easily reproduced in the following way: Just
create several "arrays," each with multiple logical drives via hpacucli,
then delete the first array, and it will blow up in deregister_disk(), in
the call to get_host() when it tries to dig the hba pointer out of a NULL
queue pointer.
The problem has been present since my code to make rebuild_lun_table
behave better went in.
