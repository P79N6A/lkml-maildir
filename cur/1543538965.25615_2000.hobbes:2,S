Subject: kernel cmdline truncation

I just installed kernel-2.2.16-8 from the rawhide srpm
and the kernel command line is being truncated
at 80 characters (according to /proc/cmdline)
This is with lilo-21.4.1-2 (again from the rawhide srpm).
It was working with my 2.2.14-12 kernel but no doesn't.
The only think I did was install the kernel
and add the new kernel to lilo.conf before the 2.2.14
kernel.
This lead to the mem=256M option being truncated so
the kernel saw 0 memory. moving it earlier fixed memory
detection, but why would the command line start being
truncated?
Is this lilo or the kernel or redhat patches to one
of them?
System: MSI-6167 w/ K7-550, 256M
