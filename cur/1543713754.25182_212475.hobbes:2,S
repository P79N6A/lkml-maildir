 drivers/char/dz.[ch] has been verified to work on real hardware, at least 
with 2.4.  Can the same be said of drivers/serial/dz.[ch]?  If so, then 
the former can be removed from the mainline.
 Anyway, I plan a functional update to drivers/char/dz.[ch], to add
missing features that should have made their way there for 2.4.  Then I'll
see what needs to be ported to drivers/serial/dz.[ch] and update it
accordingly.  Only then I'll consider the former to be in a strict bugfix
mode.  Updates to the old driver can be done solely in the MIPS 2.4 tree,
though.
