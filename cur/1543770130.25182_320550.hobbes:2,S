Well, I'm not using slabs as a custom allocator just to track leaks. 
I'm using them for two specific structures which end up getting
allocated and freed quite often (which is what I thought slab
allocators were for).  The two structures I'm slab allocating are the
directory structure (which has a fixed size), and the packet structure
(which has a fixed size per session, and may grow or shrink based on
protocol negotiation/command-line options).  I use the find_slab
routine to see if there is a slab (that I created) that already
matches the protocol negotiated size so I don't create a
slab-per-session unnecessarily.
Is this not the right way to use slabs?  Should I just be using
kmalloc/kcalloc? (Is that what you mean by drop the custom allocator?)
Sorry if I'm being dense, just want to make sure I understand what you
are saying.
