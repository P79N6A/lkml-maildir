I'm not talking about reading from pipes, that was your example.  I was
talking about calls with timeouts, like semop, whose interface do not
permit partial results.  Anyway, I find your reading insupportable even in
reference to read or write.  read and write are explicitly specified to
return partial results when interrupted by a signal, and are not permitted
to do so otherwise.  1003.1-2001 2.4.4 defines "interrupted" in reference
only to signals that are caught.
