Subject: [patch] ipv4: initialize arp_tbl rw lock
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/7/35

From: Heiko Carstens <heiko.carstens@de.ibm.com>
The qeth driver makes use of the arp_tbl rw lock. CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK
detects that this lock is not initialized as it is supposed to be.
