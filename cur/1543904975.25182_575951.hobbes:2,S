Some of them I just knew from past experiences where to find, some of
them are logical (like, obviously 'reiserfs' is found in the
Filesystems submenu), some I searched for using "/" and a few I
googled.

You're welcome.  By the way; if you had taken the time to read the
text at the top of the menuconfig interface you'd have known this
already - "... Press <Esc><Esc> to exit, <?> for Help, </> for
Search."

If you know the hardware of the system, the filesystems you use etc
etc, then it should be possible to deduce what modules you need...
Read the help text for each config option related to your modules and
think about whether or not you need it...

It means that the option was automagically selected by some other
option you selected, so you can't disable it unless you first disable
that other option that selected it.
