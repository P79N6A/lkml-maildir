This is a custom motherboard that we've developed in house :-(
It is based on the nforce4 chipset.
Looking at what I see in our lspci output we get strange values for the 
bars of the ATI device and the second Nvidia GPU, ie large negative 
values. The addresses for these devices also look strange and overlap.
I tried applying the patches from this thread. They change the behaviour 
for the configuration of the BARs, but not actually the PCI addresses 
for these devices...
I have a bunch more information on this if anyone is willing to take a look.
