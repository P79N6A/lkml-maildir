Running 2.4.19, when I use:
hdparm -Y /dev/hda
to put my Maxtor IDE HD in to 'Sleep' mode, it doesn't get automatically woken up again when it's accessed.  I presume that this is a kernel issue, (an interrupt not being issued), because resetting the device with:
hdparm -w /dev/hda
restarts it successfully.
This is using a PIIX3 IDE interface, incidently.
John.
