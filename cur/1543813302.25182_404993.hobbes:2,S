I put the locks around the kobject_put after reading
Documentation/kref.txt and after realizing that there was a race. In the
kref.txt example there is a lock around kref_put (only a mutex instead
of a spinlock). 
I still think there is a point in putting locks around kobject_put(). Or
is there a better way?
And btw, I am using kobject because this code predates kref. So maybe
one day I should just convert it to kref.
Anyway, I think the locks are necessary, the way they are implemented is
probably ugly and caused me to make the mistake in the first place. But
a while I ago posted the following patch that fixes the situation.
cmd->lock points to a persistent lock that is not freed with cmd.

Original patch:
ibmasm driver:
Fix the command_put() function which uses a pointer for a spinlock that
can be freed before dereferencing it.
