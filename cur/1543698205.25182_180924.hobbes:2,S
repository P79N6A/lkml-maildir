Hello.
I want to DMA copy data from Host computer's memory to 
PCI device's memory.(PCI device is IXP1200 Evaluation Board).
Of course, IXP1200 DMA unit can initiate DMA operation.
So I tried to use that unit, but finally I failed to use.
So I want to use host computer(or linux kernel)'s DMA mechanism
to copy data from Host computer's memory to
PCi device's memory.
How can I do that? function? simple instruction?
Please give any advice.
And if above this is complicated, 
please give me method of fast data copy between 2 memories.
Thanks!
