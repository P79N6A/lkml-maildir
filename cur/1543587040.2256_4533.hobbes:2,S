I've encountered a loopback bug on kernel-2.4.3+international_patch.  I
haven't been able to pin down what the bug is exactly, but these are the
conditions under which it manifests:
1. connect file to loopback device
2. build fs on loopback device
3. mount fs and use it
4. read the file
5. lockup, about 1 out 5 times.
The lockup occurs randomly and seems to have random effects.  Sometimes
user-space scheduling is lost and sometimes there is a total lockup.  This
is all I could extract from /var/log/messages in several crashes:
