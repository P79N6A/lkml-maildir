If this is what xntpd is doing, then you're likely running into the glibc-2 bug
that has bitten many people trying to get ntp-4 running.  In a nutshell, ntp
uses two kernel PLL routines, ntp_gettime and ntp_adjtime; linux, OTOH, provides
just one superset, called adjtimex.  Libc5 (glibc-1) correctly provides wrappers
that convert the ntp_x calls to linux adjtimex, but glibc-2 omits one of them.
Hence, the configure thinks they're not present.  I forget the workaround, but
H.J.Lu I think made patches to glibc2 to fix this.  You can fudge it by
hand-editing the results of the ./configure to enable the accurate adjtimex
(etc).
