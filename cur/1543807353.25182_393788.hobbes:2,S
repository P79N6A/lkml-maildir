I did a quick check of all the different architectures and was unable
to find any architecture that does what you describe below. All coalescing
appears to be done by only modifying the dma_length and dma_address fields in
the scatterlist.

Disagree. This is how I would expect the sglist to look after pci_map_sg:
struct page *a, length A, dma_addr a, dma_length A+B
struct page *b, length B, dma_addr c, dma_length C
struct page *c, length C, dma_addr n/a, dma_length n/a

No. I can't find any code in any architecture that modifies either the length,
page, or offset fields in the *_map_sg routines.
I'm still failing to see an actual bug in the ipr driver. Unless there is a
good reason for pushing additional complexity on every caller of pci_map_sg
to do additional bookkeeping, such as an architecture that is actually modifying
fields in the scatterlist other than the dma_* fields, then I think it makes
more sense to clarify the API to say that pci_map_sg will not modify these fields.
