Ok, thanks for straightening me out on that. I figured there might be some
consequence of  the additional knobs in -aa which I didn't know about.

I didn't. That was one of the "additional parameters" that I left at the default
on -aa (500, it seems). Sorry, I should have been clearer about exactly what
settings I used on -aa; the quoted settings were for -rmap only. For reference,
the exact command I tried on -aa was:
/bin/echo "10 500 0 0 500 3000 30 20 0" > /proc/sys/vm/bdflush

Unfortunately, those adjustments on top of 2.4.18-pre2aa2 set a new record for
worst performance: 7:19.
An additional datapoint: The quoted bdflush settings which make 2.4.17-rmap11c a
winner do not do well at all on 2.4.17-rmap11a. Rik's initial reaction to the
issue was that there was a bug and I know he made some changes in rmap11c to
address it. The fact that 11c definitely performs better for me than 11a seems
to support this. Perhaps this bug or a variant thereof also exists in aa?
