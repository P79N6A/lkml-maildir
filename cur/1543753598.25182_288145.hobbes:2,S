Oops!  Sorry.  I generated those by hand using some rather crude 
`diff -u .... >> xxx.diff' commands.  
We should just add Rui's latest version to JACK CVS.

I'd be surprised if we're hitting it in this test.  AFAICT, our
"Average DSP Load" should approximate your CPU limit.  That's running
in the 30% to 40% range.  Is there any way to verify this?  Is your
running average readable in /proc/sys/kernel somewhere?
We do need to test that the system degrades gracefully when the CPU is
overloaded.  That *will* happen (the dreaded P4 float denormal
problems quickly come to mind).  At some point, the user should be
allowed to choose how much CPU to consume, possibly shutting down
plugins as needed.

Hard to say for sure without trying it.  These threads are dealing
with a realtime cycle that is smaller than normal scheduler time
slices.  Getting all the work done is important.  But, getting it done
in the right order might make a difference for important statistics
like Max Delay.
