True... What about a vma-level COW-ahead just like we have a file-level
read-ahead, then? I mean batching the COW at unCOW-because-of-write time.

Not possible for me since I've got no SMP. But posting a quick note about
your proposed "fake-NUMA-on-SMP.patch" would be good only if to have an
offsite (offbrain also? ;) backup of your ideas :)
