My solution may be worse than that.  Because set_cpus_allowed() will
fail if asked to set a non-overlapping cpumask, my solution could never
terminate.  If asked to set a cpusets cpus to something that went off
line right then, this I'd guess this code could keep looping forever,
looking for cpumasks that didn't match, and then not noticing that it
was failing to set them so as they would match.
... it needs work ... or the alternative solution from Paul M.
