Which ones? I am always told "it's faster, then", but nobody really
proofed that. Take some multithreadded apps. How often do they *really*
lock/unlock mutexes, and in which ratio does that compare to their
"normal" computing needs?
If an application's main job is locking/unlocking mutexes, then the
author should possibly think about that. If it's main task is to do the
computational stuff, then I've got no (real) problem with this extra
Linux^Wtax, esp. on those faster boxes...
