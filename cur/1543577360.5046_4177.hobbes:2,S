Hi Ludo,
I didn't realise you were still working on this.  Did you know that
I am also?  Our most recent version is at:
ftp://ftp.mvista.com/pub/Area51/preemptible_kernel/
although I have yet to put up a 2.4.0-prerelease patch (coming soon).
We should probably pool our efforts on this for 2.5.
Cheers,
Nigel
