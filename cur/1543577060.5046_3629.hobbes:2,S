On all kernels newer than 2.4.0t13p3 I have the following problem.
shorly after boot (some seconds) the system freeze. I can only swith consoles
but i am not able to login. Over the net I get onyl responses to
pings nothing else.
Up to kernel 2.4.0.t13p3 everythings works fine.
Sorry for this simple description, but I am not able to get more clear infos.
No oops, nothing in the logs after reboot with 240t13p3.
Perhaps someone has an idea where to dig?
