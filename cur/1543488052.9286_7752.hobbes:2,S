I noticed that under later kernel releases I can flag functions and data
in modules as initialisation only so they are thrown away.  This is good 
because I can throw away my hardware microcode which is fairly large but 
if I have any PCMCIA devices I need to keep it so that I can reinitialise
the card later on if it is pulled out and inserted again.  Is there a way
to optionally flag initialisation code and data as non discardable at
runtime.
Thanks
