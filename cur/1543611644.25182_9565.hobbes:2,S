Hi all you smart folk.
    I've been trying to use the rivafb driver for my console, because I 
like 1024x768 console resolution, but dislike the slowness of the vesa 
framebuffer.  Every time I start X and then switch to a text console, it 
begins to mess up (my cursor turns into 2 purple dots) and if I try to 
switch back to X the console is completely corrupted, forcing me to 
reboot.  Is there a conflict that makes it incorrect to use a 
framebuffer text console and a different accelerated X console?  Or is 
this a bug in the memory handling of the rivafb that makes it conflict 
with the NVidia accelerated stuff, OR can I not ask this here, because 
I'm using the unlicensed NVidia kernel drivers?
Thanks!
