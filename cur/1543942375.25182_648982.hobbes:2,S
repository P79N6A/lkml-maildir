this line itself got inherited from old spaghetti code from 
arch/i386/mm/pageattr.c:split_large_page(). That line was added 6 years 
ago when pageattr.c was written. [see commit c8712aebd in historic-git]
This line was not outright buggy in its original form, but it was an 
inherently dangerous and sloppy construct: why does it transform an 
"address" into a physical address like that? We _always_ use "address" 
as a linear address, and some separate variable name for physical 
addresses. This line was just waiting for a bug to be introduced: the 
moment any virtual-address code is introduced _after_ this line, it can 
easily pass visual inspection because the code "looks" correct.
In all new cpa code we introduced explicit transformations like:
        unsigned long phys_addr = __pa(address);
but this 6 year old line slipped through and we moved it to a place 
where it indeed caused the bug you triggered :-/
Our bad and thanks for fixing it :)
one reason why we didnt trigger the crash (sooner) in qa is because the 
CPA self-tests run while there's essentially no user-space contexts - so 
even though i do test 2G:2G !PAE kernels too, corruption of the 
pagetables went unnoticed. (and the main risk and focus in cpa is on 
kernel pagetables, not on user pagetables)
So, to prevent such bugs in the future, i've just modified the cpa 
self-test to run in a kthread and to be delayed by 30 seconds, that 
places it right into the user-space bootup sequence.
that triggered the following "bad pgd" crash right on the first boot 
attempt:
[   32.597881] CPA exercising pageattr
[   32.601289] CPA mapping 4k 2048 large 254 gb 0 x 2302[80000000-bfc00000] mis0
[   32.047209] pam_console_app[2908]: segfault at 8049956 ip 08049956 sp 7fef40]
[   32.621678] mm/memory.c:115: bad pgd 3e59b163.
[   32.621711] ------------[ cut here ]------------

[   32.621715] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP
[   32.621717]
and with your fix applied it runs just fine.

Subject: x86: delay CPA self-test and repeat it
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
delay the CPA self-test so that any impact (corruption) of
user-space pagetables can be triggered.
this would have prevented the bug fixed by 8cb2a7c1e95e472b5
at its source.
