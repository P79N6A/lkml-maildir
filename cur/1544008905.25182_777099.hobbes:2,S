Per Bartolomiej's reasoning, I recompiled
xorg-x11-drv-ati-6.9.0-61.fc10.x86_64.rpm without the remove-limit-heuristics
patch. However, I still see errors like the one above. In addition, since
upgrading to F10 I also see visual artifacts on my (composited) desktop. See
Xorg.0.log (generated with the remove-limit-heuristics aptch) as attached to
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=469214
