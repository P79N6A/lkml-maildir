Nothing, I suspect.  OCFS2 has a problem like this, too.  It wants a way
for a file system to serialize mmap/munmap/mremap during file IO.  Well,
more specifically, it wants to make sure that the locks it acquired at
the start of the IO really cover the buf regions that might fault during
the IO.. mapping activity during the IO can wreck that.
