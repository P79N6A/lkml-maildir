Hi everybody,
Here is my latest version.  It dinamically computes the mean value
of the kbd delay, correctly takes care of the 0xE0 prefix and prefixed
keys, and has no more side effects that would affect normal keyboards,
IMHO.
Linus: your call: either to put it as is or to make it configurable.
Either way is fine with me, thanks.
Best regards,
Andrei
