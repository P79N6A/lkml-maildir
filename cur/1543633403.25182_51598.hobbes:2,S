Hi Brad,
There was an announcement earlier today of some networking
documentation.  I think that it's still in its early stages, though.
>From the 'netdev' list:
Hi,
I am working on a doc on "Networking Subsystem" in the Linux kernel.
This
is part of the "Linux Kernel documentation project" (www.lkdp.tk).
Chapter 2 of this doc is almost complete. I was hoping for some feedback
on this doc. Its available at
www.corewars.org/~radical/lkdp
Only Chapter 2 has been started as of now, its nearing completion.
I am looking for feedback on the contents, the general feel of the book,
flow.. etc. Any kind of feedback actually.
Thank you
-Anks
