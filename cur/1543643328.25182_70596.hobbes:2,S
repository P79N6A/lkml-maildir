Not as easy as missing ones point, yes.

Yes, but you don't seem to. (No, I don't want to insult you here.)
Just to draw that:
2p:
thread1						thread2
struct x *y = malloc(sizeof(struct x));
check y;
blah();						cleanup(y et al);
touch y->blah; /* bang */
4p:
thread1						thread2
struct x *y = malloc(sizeof(struct x));
check y;
struct z *a = malloc(sizeof(struct z));
check a;					cleanup(y et al);
struct u *v = malloc(sizeof(struct u));
check v;
return success;
(back in caller - from that moment we're protected against arbitrariness 
from other threads)
check y; <-- detected
You know? We allocate, we lock, we check, we win.
