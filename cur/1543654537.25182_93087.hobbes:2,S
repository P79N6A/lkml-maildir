The size of the vmalloc area is 128 MB, 96 for highmem kernels.
Either:
- compile a kernel without 4G support, then you have 128 MB
- increase PKMAP_BASE (include/asm-i386/highmem.h) to
	0xff800000 (it's 0xfe000000 in 2.5.50)
Right now 32 MB virtual memory are reserved for kmap, but only 4 MB are 
used. Changing PKMAP_BASE gives you 24 MB additional vmalloc space for free.
- increase __VMALLOC_RESERVE.
