hi. jp.
i have a question on Asynchronous I/O features in Red Hat Linux 6.0(Hedwig)
kernel 2.2.12.
my interest lies in aio.h and aio_read(), aio_write() in librt.a.
i tried to run my test program which is simply calling aio_read and
aio_write in a finite loop.
aio_read and aio_write return with error "Interrupted system call" everytime
they are called.
well, it looks like the system calls are there and my program seems ok to
me...
has this aio package proved to be working fine ?
what could be the possible cause(s) ?
do you know where i can get the sources for the aio package ?
not in 2.2.12 kernel, right ?
i am not sure if i am asking all these to a proper person and in proper
method.
please let me know otherwise.
thank you.
seong from montreal.
