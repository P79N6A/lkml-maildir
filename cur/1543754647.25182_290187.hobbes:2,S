Take a look at this technical advisory for the STL2 board, I'm fairly
sure this is your issue.
http://support.intel.com/support/motherboards/server/sb/CS-010790.htm
IP fragmented packets as part of an NFS file transfer are improperly
being identified as TCO management packets and are being routed to the
BMC.  The fix is to upgrade the BMC firmware.
Updated BMC firmware and BIOS images for this board are available at
