Make sure to also test with regular 1x AGP (and no fast write stuff etc). 
A lot of motherboards really aren't going to like 4x and some other 
settings (in particular, enabling fast writes seems to be a very iffy 
proposition indeed).
Also, check if the same setup is stable under 2.4.x and possibly using the
DRI CVS tree. Radeon in particular seems to be a lot stabler in DRI these 
days than it has historically been.
Indeed, one of the reasons it took me so long to figure out the stability
issues I saw was simply that there have been real bugs in direct
rendering, and I was blaming them instead and I spent a lot of time trying 
to chase down the bug as an AGP or DRI issue.
