I have been doing a bit more checking and the pppd appears to go
away.  So maybe Richards solution will work.  The ppp0,? interface is
what appears to not be dropped.
Truthfully, I don't get a chance to do a lot of testing because it
doesn't happen all the time.  This is a machine with three modems
which are being accessed quite a bit.  The actual interface not
getting dropped happens maybe once every day or two.  If I ignore the
problem though it isn't long before all the interfaces, well three
interfaces are used in the interface/routing table and pppd says all
the lines are used.  I'm mostly guessing at this last bit.  What I am
sure of only is if a call comes in on a line which has an interface
which ppp considers up, it won't reasign the interface.
