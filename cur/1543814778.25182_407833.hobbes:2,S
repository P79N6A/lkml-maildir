What does that question mean, btw?
-mm is looking like linux-2.6.38 at present so of course things got tangled
up - sched-activate-sched-batch-expired.patch modifies __activate_task().
I ended up with the below.  
Which do we think is more likely to be true - batch_task(p) or
expired_starving(rq)?  batch_task() looks cheaper to evaluate so I put that
first.  But I guess it's less likely to be true.  hmm.
