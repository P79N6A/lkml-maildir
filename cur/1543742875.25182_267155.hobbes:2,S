ah, found it. Only RT tasks were supposed to get special priority
handling, while in fact all tasks got it - so when Thomas ran hackbench
(Thomas, you did, right?) it created an O(nr_hackbench) overhead within
the mutex code ... I've uploaded -V0.6.5 to the usual place:

Thomas, can you confirm that this kernel fixes the irqs-off latencies? 
(the priority loop indeed was done with irqs turned off.)
i'm not sure this fix is related to the deadlocks reported though.
