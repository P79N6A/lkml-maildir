The original clone() system call was misdesigned.  Even if you chose
to ignore ia64, clone() cannot be used by portable applications to
specify a stack (think "stack-growth direction").
clone() should have specified a stack memory *area* from the
beginning.  (UNIX got this right from the beginning, see, e.g.,
sigaltstack()).
