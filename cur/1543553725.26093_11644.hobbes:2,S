   Just some updates. This problem does not appear to happen under
   2.2.16.  The dump for 2.2.16 is almost the same except we send an
   mss back of 536 and not 1460 (remote mtu vs local mtu).
MSS advertized makes no difference, it controls not what sized
payloads we send, which is determined in this case by PMTU and thus
both Linux 2.2.x and 2.4.x send equally sized limited packets.
Later,
