Yes that could explain it. I ignored it on x86-64 because it always uses
SYSCALL/SYSRET (at least for 64bit)  @)
The real fix for that would be support of SYSENTER/SYSCALL on 32bit too
(more likely SYSENTER because it's supported by Athlons and SYSCALL is too 
broken on K6 to be usable) 
An int $0x80 does a awful lot of locked cycles for example and IRET is 
also not exactly a speed daemon and very complex.
SYSENTER/SYSEXIT would be likely a much bigger win than nanooptimizations of 
a few cycles around this.
