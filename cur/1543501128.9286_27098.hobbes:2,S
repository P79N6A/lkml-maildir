quite a while ago I've raised HZ fron 100 to 1024 on an old DX2/66.
comparing kernel compile time (obviously CPU bound with 20MB ram
and ~95% CPU utilisation) there was a slowdown of ~1 min for 
a total compile time of ~55 min.  so you can see the effect,
but even for a DX2/66 it wasn't bad at all (and it did solve the
problems where I needed HZ >> 100).
