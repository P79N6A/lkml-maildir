Hello,
It seems that the time quantum for normal Processes is 210ms. But it appears that for Processes using RR_SCHED policy the time Quamtun is 2 seconds for the first re-scheduling.
The Questions i have are :
Why these 2 seconds time slice ?
How can i define a better time quantum ?
Why sched_rr_get_interval always return 150000 nano seconds ( fixed in the code ! ) ?
Thanx for explanations ...
TIA ;-)
Patrick
