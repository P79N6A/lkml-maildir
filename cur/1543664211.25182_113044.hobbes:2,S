Can you expand on "sucks"?  4GB is not really that large of a system anymore.
I still don't see how this memory taken up by buffers/cache is not freed when
a system process needs it.  I have always thought that this type of memory is
by definition "lower priority", and should be dropped when a process needs
more memory.  Is this not the case?
