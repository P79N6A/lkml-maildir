Hmmm.. I think I may have a test-case for the problem.
Lookie here:
	#include <signal.h>
	#include <sys/mman.h>
	void function(void)
	{
		printf("Copy protected: ok\n");
	}
	void handler(int signo)
	{
		extern char smc;
		smc++;
	}
	#define TF 0x100
	int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
		void (*fnp)(void);
		signal(SIGTRAP, handler);
		mprotect((void *)(0xfffff000 & (unsigned long)main), 4096, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE);
		asm volatile("pushfl ; orl %0,(%%esp) ; popfl"
			: :"i" (TF):"memory");
		asm volatile("pushfl ; andl %0,(%%esp) ; popfl"
			: :"i" (~TF):"memory");	
		asm volatile("\nsmc:\n\t"
			".byte 0xb7\n\t"
			".long function"
			:"=d" (fnp));
		fnp();
		exit(1);
	}
Compile it, run it, and it should say
	Copy protected: ok
Now, try to "strace" it, or debug it with gdb, and see if you can repeat 
the behaviour.
Roland? Think of it as a challenge,
