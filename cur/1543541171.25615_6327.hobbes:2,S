 Thanks for the clarification.  Certain chips handle it differently, for
example Zilog's 8530 asserts a BREAK interrupt as soon as a BREAK
condition is detected (regardless of other events), then when the BREAK
condition is removed it asserts a BREAK-deassert interrupt, after which a
null character is available (with a respective data interrupt).
