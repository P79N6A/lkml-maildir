This patchset is the resubmit of the Ethernet over IPv4 tunnel driver
for Linux.  I want to thank all reviewers for their annotations and
helpfull input.  This version contains some major changes to the driver.
It uses an own device type now (ARPHRD_ETHERIP). This fixes the problem
that EtherIP devices could not be safely differenced from Ethernet
devices. This change also required some other changes. First a second
patch to the bridge code is included to allow the use of EtherIP devices
in a bridge.  The third patch includes the necessary changes to iproute2
(support of the new ARPHRD and general tunnel configuration support for
 EtherIP).
