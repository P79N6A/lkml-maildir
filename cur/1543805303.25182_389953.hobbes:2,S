I agree completely with his statements, therefore he speaks for at  
least two people and "we" is proper usage.  I suspect given the posts  
on this list the last time this flamewar came up that there are more  
as well, but 2 is enough.

Irrelevant to the discussion at hand, we are talking only about linux  
and what should be done on linux.

No, you have this wrong:
- One of them (IE: Linux) requires a /dev/[hs]d* device-name related  
access
- Only 4 others allow /dev/hd*
However, the later is _completely_ _irrelevant_ to the discussion, as  
we are talking about Linux *only*.

Wrong again:
17 platforms need libscg's addressing
4 platforms offer /dev/* access
1 platform (Linux) _requires_ /dev/* access
You are perfectly free to adjust your compatibility layer accordingly.

Personal attacks are offtopic, irrelevant, and rude.  Please refrain  
from doing so.  If you don't plan to respond to somebody's email,  
just don't, no reason to shout about it to a world who doesn't care.
Cheers,
