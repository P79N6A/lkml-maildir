Why does the kernel have very few useful tests?
 Lack of interest? resources? expertise?
Ideally each new feature would just be a small add on to an existing test.
Unlike developing new features which seems to grow well with more developers.
Bug fixing also seems to be a scarcity process. There often seems to be
a very few people that understand the problem well enough or have the necessary
hardware to reproduce and fix the problem.
Recent changes like tickless and scheduler rework were well thought out and caused
very little impact to 90% of the users. The problem is the 10% who do have problems.
Worse, the developers often only hear about the a small sample of those.
