I don't think I have that fix applied here.
I couldn't find any read_ahead* nor *ra_* under /sys, but blockdev works.
Btw, by default it was using a read ahead of 128 Kb (blockdev returned 256)
I re-run the dd read tests on reiserfs on the qla device (the one that took 
1m27s before). These are the results on 2.6.4 :
blockdev --setra 1024 /dev/sde : 28s
(but this is the dd test in a most probably unfragmented file, so it's not a 
value that can be used in real life)
blockdev --setra 512 /dev/sde : 51s (approx. what 2.4.21 took by default)
blockdev --setra 256 /dev/sde : 1m27s
blockdev --setra 128 /dev/sde : 2m9s
blockdev --setra 64 /dev/sde  : 2m55s
blockdev --setra 0 /dev/sde   : 13m33s
On 2.4.21:
By default, /proc/sys/vm/min-readahead is 3 and /proc/sys/vm/max-readahead is 
127. I suppose those are Kb, since it didn't allow me to set a read ahead 
value over 255 when using blockdev.
blockdev --setra 1024 /dev/sde : n/a (BLKRASET: Invalid argument)
blockdev --setra 512 /dev/sde : n/a (BLKRASET: Invalid argument)
blockdev --setra 256 /dev/sde : n/a (BLKRASET: Invalid argument)
blockdev --setra 255 /dev/sde :  52s
blockdev --setra 0 /dev/sde   : 54s
As this was unexpected (it seems blockdev is a NOP on 2.4.21 ?), I tried 
modifying /proc/sys/vm/min-readahead and max.
I set both to 512 (which should match blockdev --setra 1024 on 2.6.4) and got
25s reading
Setting both to 128kb (blockdev --setra 256), it took 49s.
Setting both to 0 (disabling read-ahead), it took 3m29s (compare that to  
13m33s on 2.6.4, so definitely, there's some problem here).
Anything else I can do to help to find the problem?
