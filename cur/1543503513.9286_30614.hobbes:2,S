Hi,
I have loaded the S.u.S.E. 6.1 distribution.
I have both an IDE and a SCSI disk on an Adaptec 2940 controller.
The BIOS can see the controller and identifies the disk just fine.
Linux cannot see it.  Supposedly, the aic7xxx driver should
work with it.....  Meanwhile, I dual boot by going into the
BIOS and changing the primary boot device from IDE to SCSI and back...
Also, I have a relatively new Iomega parport zip drive.
Despite loading the parport driver, neither the imm driver
(which I think is the right one) nor the ppa driver will
load.  They complain of the port being busy.  There is
nothing on it that I know about.  The HOWTOs were not too
helpful.  One mentioned that a certain message meant that
SCSI was loaded but could not see anything.  I got that
message, but the HOWTO did not say what to do about
it  :-(.
Help, please?  :)
