On the older kernels when I did a ps -ax | grep sendmail  I got
848 ?        S      0:00 sendmail: accepting connections
on newer kernels (for example  2.3.48) I get
848 ?        S      0:00 sendmail: accepting connect
What can I change to make it show the stuff I got in the older kernels.
Is sendmail doing it wrong (changing its argv[0]) or the kernel is doing it
wrong?
(or do both parties disagree)
Is there anyway I can get the newer kernels to show it right?
Thanks
