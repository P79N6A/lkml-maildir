I did the loop inside the kernel, so the syscall overhead is less of
an issue.  4k is a safe bet for _really_ slow devices and if people
want to increase it, hey, it's just a single constant to touch.

Personally, I don't care much either.  It's nice to get some test
coverage and Steve French liked to have it for cifs.  Anyway, for the
curious, here is the loop patch.
Tested, sendfile(2) returns a short count if you send a signal to the
calling process.  Add another loop in the userspace caller to deal
with it, if you don't already have it.  It's a valid and documented
return value, after all.
Andrew, I'll resend all four patches to you in new thread.

Linus and Andrew are rightfully concerned about local DoS via a large
file->file sendfile().  This patch turns large sendfile() calls into a
loop of 4k chunks.  After each chunk, it adds a cond_resched for
interactivity and a signal check to allow aborts etc. after the user
found out what a bad idea this may be.
