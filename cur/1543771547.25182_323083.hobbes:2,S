Hi Jack,
I have not seen this problem, however I don't think it has
had much testing with multilevel NUMA domains.
If you could do some more digging that would be great, however
I plan to get time on a 64-way IA64 next week and look at
some scheduler issues, so I'll keep this in mind if you haven't
made any progress.
Thanks,
Nick
