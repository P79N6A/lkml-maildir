since SCHED_CPUBOUND would be inherited across fork(), it should be
rather easy to start an X session with all tasks as SCHED_CPUBOUND.
but i think the above rather points in the direction of some genuine
weakness in the interactivity code (i know, for which the fix is
staircase ;) which would be nice to debug.

well, SCHED_CPUBOUND would solve their needs too, right?
