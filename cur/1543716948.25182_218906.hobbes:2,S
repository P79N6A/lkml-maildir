Odd? Why that? If you can think of something better, just tell me. The
only other way I could think of was faking subclient's private data so
that it points to the i2c_client structure itself. That way, freeing
i2c_get_clientdata(client) would always work. However, I was fearing
some side effect. Maybe the code makes use of the NULL data for
remembering which clients are subclients at some point? I think I
remember that the 2.4 drivers did, but maybe the 2.6 ones don't. I can
take another look and propose that different solution if you want.
Thanks.
