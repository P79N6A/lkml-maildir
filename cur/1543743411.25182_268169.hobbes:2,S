i applied your earlier patch but many more changes were needed to port
PREEMPT_REALTIME (and in particular, PREEMPT_HARDIRQS) to x64. You can
check out the x64 bits in -V0.7.8 which can be downloaded from the usual
place:

Sid, does this one build/work for you? (i had to disable CPUFREQ in the
.config to get it to build - an -mm bug i suspect.)
