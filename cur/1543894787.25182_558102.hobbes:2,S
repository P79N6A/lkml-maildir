Not really, not to the entire system.  The spirit is not clear in this
regard, when it talks about "all rights", but I understand it means
"all rights related with the program", i.e., "you must let others do
with the program everything that you can".

Sorry that I have been unclear.  This just goes to show that what we
write isn't always the whole story, and quite often intent doesn't
shine through the words.  While legal terms have a stronger demand for
clarity and non-ambiguity, intent and other less-formal forms of
communication often depend on a lot of context for correct
interpretation.  And then, if multiple interpretations are possible,
the only resort is to ask the author and hope s/he still remembers
what s/he meant.
