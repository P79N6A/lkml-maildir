Why cant you use loopback as the placeholder interface for the VIPA 
IP?

hey presto, "virtual IP" which you can redistribute connected in 
ospfd/ripd whatever and publish in DNS.

What problems did you ahve?

ip route add default via <gateway> src <virtual ip>
Having zebra be able to apply route-maps to routes and set src would 
be useful too.
But why do you need this even? See below about replies. Just publish 
the virtual IP in DNS, not the interface addresses.

TCP responses to requests that come in addressed to the virtual IP 
will automatically have source of that virtual IP. For UDP too if app 
binds to the virtual IP or uses IP_HDRINCL. Not sure about kernel UDP 
though, but I bet linux-nfs list would be amienable to any changes 
needed for knfsd to work nicely with virtual/loopback IPs.

How does bonding come into it?
