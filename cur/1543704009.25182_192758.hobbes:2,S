By now means. I, however, didn't even try to get a solution since back
then. Since the bug appeared with a patched 2.6.0 and 2.6.1-mm2, which
was one of the first patches including the new ACPI, it was clear to
me that it was ACPI related and that I would better wait for somebody
to find the root of the evil and to kill it.
I see your "Notebook vs. Linux"-story continues to be unsuccessfull,
