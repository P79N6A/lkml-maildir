Hi there.
 RW>>> As has been stated several times, the comments regarding number
 RW>>> of arguments are irrelevant, as the POSIX standard explicitly
 RW>>> allows them.
 KV>> Where ?
 DW> POSIX.2, 2.11.3:
 DW> Options: When this subclause is listed as `None' it means that
 DW> the implementation need not support any options.
                        ^^^^^^^^
 DW> POSIX.2, 2.11.4:
 DW> Operands: When this subclause is listed as `None' it means that
 DW> the implementation need not support any operands.
                        ^^^^^^^^
DW: Many thanks...
KV: Note the phraseology there, in particular the use of "need not"
    with its inbuilt implication of "can, providing other conditions
    are met"...
Best wishes from Riley.
