But the thing is, technical people don't actually care about the version 
confusion.
The real issue is that ext3 is a stable filesystem, and the ext4 stuff 
buys fundamentally and absolutely _nothing_ for the vast majority of uses. 
Except pain.
So the real reason for the split would be the _user_ split. There are 
people who want big filesystems, and there are people who don't care. 
It's that simple.

That's a total piece of bullshit. Nobody seriously gripes about the 
duplication, and the ones that do have absolutely no idea what that split 
bought us. Ignore them.
