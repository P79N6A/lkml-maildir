Yes, I noticed that, however, when it stops using tsc, is there a way to
see what the current strategy is?  I.e. to what time source it is
falling back to? Or perhaps this is always the same? And because of this
not implemented into the proc-fs?  I have just briefly looked at the
kernel source for this, I'll have a closer look today if I can find the
time.

Sure, Here is some info from bios:
Machine Type:  867373X
Flash EEPROM Revision Level: PLE161AUS
System Board Identifier: NA60B7Y0S3Q
System Serial Number: KDZZ6FC
Bios Date: 09/10/03
Some more info from Advanced/Cpu Frequency:
Bus: 133  MHz
Cpu Multiplier: 18 X
Processor Speed: 2.8 GHz
Single processor MP Table: Enabled
MP Table Version: 1.4
Hyper-Threading technology: ----------
Just a thought, how much if any, increase in performance can one gain
when disabling the Single processor MP Table option? It says, in the
help on that options, that one can benefit from disabling it on a
UP-system if I don't remember wrong now.
