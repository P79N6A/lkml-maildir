Fine, we can put it read-only, we'll drop the "mode" field.

it's overkill if you're thinking in terms of kbs or mbs of data.
it isn't if you're looking at gbs and 100gbs. please read my
other posting as to who is using this and how.
but regardless of access, you have to have some way of telling
relayfs of the size of the channel you want. bufsize, nbufs
just tell relayfs the size of the buffers you want and how many
buffers there are in the ring. both of which are really basic
to any sort of buffering scheme.

Ok, it will go.

Ok, we'll leave it to the caller to do a relay_write() with his
init-bufs at startup.
