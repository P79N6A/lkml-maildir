 Hmm, that's interesting.  It would be worthwhile to see a dump of APICs'
state when this happens -- maybe an EOI message gets lost for some reason
or an erratum is biting us.  There are functions for such kind of
diagnostics already available; they are print_IO_APIC() and
print_all_local_APICs() and may be called on demand by a tiny module, for
example.
