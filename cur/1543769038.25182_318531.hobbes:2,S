Which is a different story and doesn't protect from dying power supply
units.  I have replaced several PSUs that died "in mid-flight" and that
were not overloaded. UPS isn't going to help in that case. Of course you
can use a redundant PSU, redundant UPS - but that's easily more than a
battery-backed up cache on a decent RAID controller - since drive
failure will also toast file systems.

As long as one can rely on the kernel scheduling writes in the proper
order, no problem that I'd see. ext3 has apparently been doing this for
a long time in the default options, and I have yet to see ext3
corruption (except for massive hardware failure such as b0rked non-ECC
RAM or a harddisk that crashed its heads).

Most drive manufacturers make more extensive guarantees about what gets
NOT damaged when a write is interrupted by power loss, and are careful
to turn the write current off pretty soon on power loss. None of the OEM
manuals I looked at advised that data that was already on disk would be
damaged beyond the block that was being written.
