Intel Speedstep iirc. My Vaio also has it. My findings so far:
On mains it runs at 700MHz, whilst on batteries it drops to ~550MHz.
If I boot an ACPI enabled kernel, the speed changes according to CPU
load, but with a smaller window. I've seen it go as low as 50MHz,
but only up to a maximum of 200MHz.   The fact that it only has a maximum
of 200MHz in this mode probably explains the need for the no-idle switch
in the current ACPI implementation.
As there are no public documents on Speedstep, it's not clear to me
whether this is a limitation of Speedstep, or the ACPI implementation.
Judging by the fact that Windows seems to run at full speed, I'd
be inclined to think the latter.
regards,
Dave.
