The data you are reporting is flawed: where are the average cycle 
times spent in __kfree_skb with the patch?  Without that information, 
there is no basis for conclusion as the total time spent in these 
two routines is unknown.  At worst, I'd have to assume this lack of 
scientific method is an attempt to hide some aspect of the resulting 
behaviour, but I hope that isn't the case.
