Are there any of these supported under linux/work under linux/wine/vmware.
DVB is digital video broadcasting (mpeg) -s is satellite.
It's especially interesting, as there are some companies offering
internet downlink through the satellite, and uplink through a modem.
The ability to download mpegs to disk would also be rather nice, as
disks are getting ever bigger.
Or, anyone have experience with these cards in europe?
