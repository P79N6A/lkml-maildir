(Linux 2.5.8)
In ll_rw_blk.c there's a function, ll_10byte_cmd_build() which is
supposed to be used to generate `10-byte commands'.
It appears to generate a SCSI READ_10 or WRITE_10 command (which
happen to be identical in format to the ATAPI GPCMD_{READ,WRITE}_10 commands)
Is this IDE specific, or is it meant to cover all block devices?
If it's IDE specific, why is it in ll_rw_blk.c, which is meant to be
common to all block devices?
As far as I can tell, only ide-cd.c actually uses the function in a
stock 2.5.8 kernel --- so it could theoretically be moved to ide-cd.c.
