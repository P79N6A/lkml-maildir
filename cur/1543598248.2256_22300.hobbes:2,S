----------------------------------------------------------------^^^^^
For the benefit of anyone finding this in the kernel archives and any
future Linux technical historians, this 128MB swap partition limit was
fixed by a patch submitted by Stephen C. Tweedie on 9 Jul 1998, and which 
appeared in 2.1.109 on 20 Jul 1998.
