Yeah I guess that's the hard part :)
For correctness, I guess fairness is an easy one. I think that unfairness
is basically a bug and that it would be very unfortunate to merge something
unfair. But this is just within the context of a single runqueue... for
better or worse, we allow some unfairness in multiprocessors for performance
reasons of course.
Latency. Given N tasks in the system, an arbitrary task should get
onto the CPU in a bounded amount of time (excluding events like freak
IRQ holdoffs and such, obviously -- ie. just considering the context
of the scheduler's state machine).
I wouldn't like to see a significant drop in any micro or macro
benchmarks or even worse real workloads, but I could accept some if it
means haaving a fair scheduler by default.
Now it isn't actually too hard to achieve the above, I think. The hard bit
is trying to compare interactivity. Ideally, we'd be able to get scripted
dumps of login sessions, and measure scheduling latencies of key proceses
(sh/X/wm/xmms/firefox/etc).  People would send a dump if they were having
problems with any scheduler, and we could compare all of them against it.
Wishful thinking!
