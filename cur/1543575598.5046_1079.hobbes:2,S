it is? i don't see the sensors stuff, so you must mean just the i2c
bits. Any word on whether we'll see sensors code go in to 2.4?
like i said, their code has worked well for me, but they seem intent
on keeping it as obscure as possible... (i remember someone posted to
l-k that they'd started a sensors project, and had code for the LM80.
he wasn't at all aware of lm_sensors!).
