Hello,
i have Problems with 2.2.10 SMP Kernel (Dual PII 450 256MB RAM).
Afer an average of 2 Days the Systems hangs with no
Message at the Logs.
Even the ac12 Patch does not resolv the Problem.
Somtimes the Machine is still responding to ping
But no Telnet nore Console login works.
Sometimes the Machine hangs completly.
Any one that has solved this Kind of Problem ?
Thanks
Robert
