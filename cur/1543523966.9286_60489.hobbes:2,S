No the tools are still broken. I will upload now the pre4 of the quota-2.00
tools which don't have the above problems. And also fix a lot of other bugs
at the tool side. If this version works I plan on releasing a final 2.00
soon.

They went into 2.00 some time ago, only I never came to releasing a 2.00
version of the tools. The pre3 version of 2.00 is for some time now
on ftp.cistron.nl. So people try quota-2.00-pre4 from
ftp://ftp.cistron.nl/pub/people/mvw/quota/quota-2.00-pre4.tar.gz
