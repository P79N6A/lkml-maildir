I always believed that it was possible, but not on all cdroms.
If this was supported, people with lots of cpus could be told to
get some of the sane cdroms for their big boxes.
One solution is to have the kernel do this kind of polling itself,
in the device drivers for removeable media.
Then it can simply notify userspace when something happens,
and userspace can decide to play music, mount a fs, or whatever
people want to happen.

Sure, a DOS waiting to happen.  If they can poll twice a second, whats
to stop them from trying to poll a hundred times a second, or in
a busy loop?
