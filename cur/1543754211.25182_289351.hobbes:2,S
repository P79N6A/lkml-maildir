Hmm.. It looks different to me - almost all users of the xxx_ref_wait() 
that act on pty's _do_ seem to use tty->link->ldisc.*()". The one counter- 
example seems to be pty_set_termios().
But I only did a quick grep in drivers/char, so there might be other users 
out there I didn't even think of.
While doing that, I did notice that all the other tty ops do take the 
kernel lock still - both read() and write() do. I wonder if we should just 
make poll() consistent, regardless of other issues (obviously, the nicest 
way to make it consistent would be to remove the kernel lock from the 
read/write paths, but I assume nobody wants to go through the locking).

ierdnah - can you verify whether either of my silly patches seems to have 
made any difference? 
And I don't think it can be vhangup - that wouldn't clear the
chars_in_buffer function pointer (it might change it to the 
n_tty_chars_in_buffer or something by resetting to N_TTY).
I'd assume that it's when the other end is changed to using the
"ppp_[sync_]ldisc", both of which do actually have a NULL
"chars_in_buffer". (Alternatively, maybe "chars_in_buffer" isn't actually
NULL at all - the backtrace might be confused by either some really
strange memory corruption or a tail-call to a NULL function pointer by
some other line discipline thing, although quite frankly I think that 
sounds extremely unlikely).
So another potential fix is to just make all tty line disciplines always 
have a valid "chars_in_buffer" pointer. We could even do automatically in 
"tty_set_operations()", ie just do a
	driver->chars_in_buffer = op->chars_in_buffer ? : default_chars_in_buffer;
(where the default just returns zero) thing or something.
That would even speed up the normal cases (no need to test the pointer for 
NULL).
