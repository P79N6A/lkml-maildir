You're probably right. The pin still exists on the flash chips, but most 
of the time on PC's at least the writability is software-controlled.
I think the hatred of pins became so high that it became almost 
unacceptable for motherboard designers to add them on PC's. Nobody wants 
to open their case any more ;)
But the whole point was to just show how silly the whole "upgradable" vs 
"not upgradable" discussion is. We're literally talking about something 
where apparently it matters to the GPLv3 whether a pin on a chip is 
connected to software or hardware (or not at all). Is that sane?
So if it's "hardware-controlled", it would be ok (because it's not meant 
to be upgraded at all)? But if it's software-controlled it is not? A set 
of rules that require this kind of nitpicking is just broken.
