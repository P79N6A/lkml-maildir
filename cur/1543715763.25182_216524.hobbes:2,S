I think it's actually better to use sendfile() rather then creating a
new syscall:
  ssize_t sendfile(int out_fd, int in_fd, off_t *offset, size_t count)
In that way you can create the file in the usual way and copy the
contents with an already existing syscall.
IMHO sendfile() has been a wrong name in the first place, copyfd()
would have been better. Why limit it to network traffic only?
