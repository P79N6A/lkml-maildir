I have another big problem with debugging :
I have :
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE=y
If the following config option is set, I can't get traces. If I unset it, I 
can't get mouse or keyboard. Do you have a work around or a patch for this ?
# CONFIG_SERIO_I8042 is not set => the trace stop and keyboard works.
CONFIG_SERIO_I8042=y => the trace is ok but no keyboard and mouse.
If the system is loaded and you can type something, an echo x >/dev/ttyS0 
fixes the problem. You can have new traces. The problem is still between the 
i8042 loading module and the system ok to works : If you have a module 
loading problem or something else, you can't get trace.
