I don't see what "discussion" is promoted by Marcelo' comment at this stage
in the game that he doesn't like the style of the XFS code, and hasn't for a
while, without any constructive examples of what he'd like changed. I'm not
sure how you got the impression that my point was that Marcelo shouldn't
post his decision not to include XFS in 2.4 to the kernel? Sorry.

One of the reasons Marcelo gives for not including XFS in 2.4 is that 2.6 is
nearly here and it includes XFS (feel free to review his posts on the
subject). My point is that that is bogus logic. Not to put too fine a point
on it, but moving a patch from one place to another is the kernel
maintainer's job.

I agree with the logic you present here, and which Larry McVoy similar
comments. My point is that XFS has gone through this mill (and Christoph
Hellwig's opinion counts infinitely more than mine on this question). The
suggestion that "the maintainer is not assured of patch reliability" with
respect to XFS seems cooked-up. 
In the final analysis, if what it takes is for a filesystem maintainer to
jump up and down screaming for XFS's inclusion, then I'm no help ...
