To be honest, the original behaviour was a bug.  A device that doesn't
enable clustering is telling us it can't take anything other than
PAGE_SIZE chunks ... trying to give it more is likely to end in tears.
However ... I'm not sure we actually have any devices that anyone can
identify which truly can't enable clustering (a lot which have it
disabled, I suspect, are that way historically because their writers
didn't trust the clustering algorithm).
So ... I think we can go ahead and cautiously enable clustering (as a
separate patch like Jens suggested).
