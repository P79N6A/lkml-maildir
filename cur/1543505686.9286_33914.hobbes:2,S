I mailed to Sigma Designs, and asked are they going to support Linux. The
answer was: 'we are doing some researching" or something like that..
Yes, It would be nice to get good mpeg1/mpeg2 hardwaresupport for Linux.
It does require some kind of kernel-support?
How about Xfree86 4.0? It has that video-hardware-acceleration thingy..
Should we try to get the specs from Sigma Designs for doing the driver for
Xfree?
