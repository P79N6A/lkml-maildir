Subject: [GIT PATCH] USB fixes for 2.6.20-rc5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here are some USB fixes for 2.6.20-rc5
They include a small number of fixes for some USB bugs, and some new
device ids, all of the details are below.  I've also disabled the USB
multithreaded probe option, as it broke a number of people's machines.
Most of them have been in the -mm releases, but due to LCA, some of them
have not.
The gadget driver update looks big, but David says it fixes a number of
problems with it, and it's self-contained.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-usb-devel mailing list, if
anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
