Due to frequent travels and lost hardware I can't even pretend
to maintain the drivers for the parallel port network adapters
D-Link de600 and de620 any more ( drivers/net/de6* ).
I am deeply thankful to the people who have added patches that
allowed these OLD drivers to live on.  We're talking about more
than TEN YEARS since they were initially created...  Scary...
If anyone still has access to these adapters and is willing to
take the responsibility for keeping the drivers alive, just
announce the take-over, tell me, and receive my blessings.
Lastly, I include a patch that updates my contact info.
I don't even know who to send the patch to -- that's how
out of touch I am ;-)
Cheers to all old and new friends,
Bjorn Ekwall <bj0rn@blox.se>
