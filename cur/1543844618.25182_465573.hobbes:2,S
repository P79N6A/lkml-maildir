Funny, I never thought I'd be defending djprobes ...

I'm with you all the way if we're talking about patching instructions
which are less than 5 bytes. And I must fault djprobes backers
for their insistence on trying to get it to work for all possible
instruction lengths. But in the specific case discussed between
Hiramatsu-san and myself (5 byte short jmp + nops) I have no reason
to believe it doesn't work. Continuing to try to get it to work on
any instruction length can be argued to be a waste of time, but not
what has been talked of of late.
With regards to all CPUs executing the int3, here's a rather savage,
but effective way of making this work:
- launch one thread per cpu (as you explained)
- have each thread make a direct jump to the location of the int3
- catch the int3 and kill active thread if this is a forced jump
This is deterministic.
So if your proposal is to amend the markup to use the short-jmp+nops
at every marker site instead of my earlier suggestion for the bprobes
thing, I'm all with you.
And I agree, 5 NOPs is *not* the right thing. 1 short jmp + 3 nops,
this works.
