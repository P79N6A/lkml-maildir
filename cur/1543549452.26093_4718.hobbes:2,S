Subject: 3c59x NIC overruns with multicast makes networking freeze

Hi,
Has anyone else seen a lot of overruns while serving multicast on a pretty
loaded (60%) network, with 3c59x cards ?  (BTW What exactly are
"overruns" ?  Are they buffer overflows on the NIC side or buffer
overflows on the kernel side, because the software can't follow, or even
something completely different ?)
 We're seeing a lot of overruns on a server which has to handle a lot of
connections.  Those connections are handled by a Java program using the
IBM Java JDK 1.1.8 on a Linux 2.2.16 kernel.
 After a while the network freezes.  I can't ping nor ssh to the machine.  
Restarting the network scripts solves the problem.
 Any suggestions ?  Tnx,
							Arnaud
