So this mean if I do:
	write(100000*MSS)
	write(1)
	write(1)
2.4 can send 100000 packet with MSS large payload plus two packets with a
payload of 1 byte even if during the two write(1) the previous packets were
still out (not acknowledged yet). Classical nagle would send 100000 packet with
MSS large payload plus 1 packet with a two bytes payload in the same
scenario.
