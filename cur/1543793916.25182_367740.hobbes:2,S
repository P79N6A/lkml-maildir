I've redone my test cases and have confirmed that O_DIRECT with pwrite64 triggers the bad
condition.
The cases that are fine are:
  pwrite64
  ftruncate with O_DIRECT
  ftruncate
Also, when the system is in this state, if I try to 'ls' the file,
the 'ls' process becomes stuck in state D in sync_page.  stracing the 'ls'
shows it is in a call to stat64.
