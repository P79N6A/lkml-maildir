True.  I understand the basics of the SLAB allocator very well, but I
stumble over the slab.c code quite a bit.  This topic came up when Ingo
replaced slab with slob in the rt patch and it killed the performance.
I introduced a cross between the slab and the slob that sped up the
system almost to that of the current slab.
Matt Mackall needs a memory management that uses the smallest amount of
memory to handle embedded systems, and brought up the approach
referenced in the paper by Bonwick.

Honestly, what I would like is a simpler solution, whether we go with a
new approach or reorganize the current slab.  I need to get -rt working,
and the code in slab is pulling my resources more than they can extend.
I'm capable to convert slab today as it is for RT but it will probably
take longer than I can afford.
Yes, if we go with a new system, it would not have all the features that
the slab has today, but I can live with that, and if I'm involved in the
work as it grows, I'll understand it better.  The problem is, I wasn't
involved in the evolution of slab, and I have to deal with what it grew
into, without being there to see why it does what it does today.
