First, you are using the 8259A (XT-PIC). This means you have
IO-APIC turned off (or it doesn't exist).

Neither. They are not related. As previously stated, a spurious
interrupt occurs when the CPU INT line becomes active, but no
interrupt controller caused it to happen. It's just that simple.
There is no magic. Given that the CPU needs to have a vector
placed on the bus every time the INT line goes active, the
interrupt controller says; "What's a mother to do?". To placate
the CPU and terminate the INT/INTA cycle, the controller puts
its lowest-priority vector on the bus. The CPU will eventually
branch to the address specified for that vector. The code there
says; "I'm IRQ7, I'm not even hooked...This must be a spurious
interrupt..."
Again, it's a hardware problem. It can't be fixed in software.
Of course, you could get rid of the "!&@#)$^#$)!@^$" message
that's mucking everybody up. Then you could use defective hardware
just like Win$
