         Out of memory
-- System halted.
Is most always caused by a bad BIOS returning the incorrect amount of
memory.
This can be fixed by adding the 'mem=' parameter to any 'append=' string
being passed to lilo in its configuration. I am not aware that there
is an explicit 'mem=' command for Lilo. If so, it doesn't work on
the version I use and it's not documented. From the documentation, and
from actual usage, I find that parameters to be passed to the kernel
take the form of a space-delimited string in quotes, like:
	append="console=ttyS1,9600 mem=24m hd=64,32,202 nfsroot=/home/nfs"
This is put into lilo.conf or on the command line as:
/sbin/lilo -C - <<EOF
	boot = /dev/fd0
	map  = /mnt/map
	backup = /dev/null
	compact
	vga = normal
	install = /mnt/boot.b
	image   = /mnt/vmlinuz
	append  = "console=ttyS1,9600 mem=24m hd=64,32,202 nfsroot=/home/nfs"
	...
	...
	...
EOF
Once the kernel is told to ignore the BIOS memory size, by the presence
of "mem=", it should boot. FYI the kernel will still boot with only
8 megs of RAM, it used to boot with only 4!. You can use mem=16m to force
sanity, then work up from there.
