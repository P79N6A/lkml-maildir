A lot of the IRQ delivery depends on the APIC. SO for example you'd
probably see horrible numbers on a PIII, but very good on PIV. It also
depends on chipset vagueries. You might also need to check that your PCI
behaviour has no posting errors since the AMD certainly seems to do a
lot more aggressive PCI posting.
Does "noapic" change the jitter ?
