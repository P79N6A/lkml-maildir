That's 100% bogus.

I sent Jason a couple of mails last time when he posted (and before that the
previous maintainer when he tried to merge it).   All were
fairly "beratungsresistent".
If you're truly interested i can dig out the mails or do a fresh review.
Long ago I did a quite clean x86-64 kgdb for Linux 2.4 based on the 
old 2.4 stub that dropped in without any strange other hooks
(except for a straight forward change to the serial code). It worked
just fine this way.
