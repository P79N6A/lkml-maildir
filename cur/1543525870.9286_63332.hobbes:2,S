Hi Net,
we are a research team at the University of Kiel (Germany) interested in
exploring the Linux way of successfully running Open-Source projects.
Perhaps you remember our announcement of an Open-Sourced study on the
motivation of Linux developers from november last year?
Meanwhile our questionnaire is ready and online (along with a
documentation of the development process), and now we like to invite you 
to answer our questions. Since time is a scarce ressource we struggled 
to keep the questionnaire as short as possible - what wasn't easy
because
there are many interesting questions about how to design a successful
Open-Source project. However, we found a good compromise so that 
completing the questionnaire will take you about 10-20 minutes.
Why should you help us? Well, here's what you might get out of it: 
* you help to complete the very first Open-Sourced internet
  questionnaire study (at least to our knowledge) 
* you contribute your experiences and opinions to understand why the
  Linux way of software development is so successful - knowledge 
  that can be used to facilitate future Open-Source projects. When 
  the survey is finished, we will make a summary of the results 
  available on the Internet, along with the (anonymized) raw data.
* you can win one of our great prices (kindly sponsored by SuSE,
  Germany), such as  
   ->  3 stuffed Tux mascots 
   ->  3 stuffed SuSE chameleons
   ->  5 Linux distributions on DVD   
   ->  and more
Since the use of our results for future Open-Source projects heavily
depends on a large number of participants, we would be very happy if as
many as possible Linux developers (i.e. you?) complete the
questionnaire.
Here's where you find the questionnaire:

We're looking forward to your participation - and thanks a lot in
advance for your time and input.

(In adition to completing the questionnaire, you can send us ideas and
comments directly to our e-mail addresses on the web-sites.)

Linux is like a wigwam: no windows, no gates, apache inside.
