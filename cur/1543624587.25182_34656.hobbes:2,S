I see it a lot on a Netgear FA310TX
( detected as Lite-On 82c168 PNIC rev 33)
With both v 1.1.8(June 16,2001) and
v 0.9.15-pre9(Nov 6, 2001)
kernel is 2.4.19-pre2-ac2 but it's been a problem for
months.

Using xfs top serve fonts to a Solaris8 box was impossible.
too many timeouts. Same for NFS mounted $HOME (from Solaris)
making it impossible to use the box.
