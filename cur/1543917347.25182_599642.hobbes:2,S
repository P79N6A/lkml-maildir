Sean,
IB aside,
it looks like an ULP which is capable of being both RDMA aware and RDMA
not-aware,
like iSER and iSCSI, NFS-RDMA and NFS, SDP and sockets, 
will be treated as two separete ULPs.
Each has its own IP address, since there is a different IP address for
iWARP
port and "regular" Ethernet port. So it falls on the users of ULPs to
"handle" it
via DNS or some other services.
Is this "acceptable" to users? I doubt it.
Recall that ULPs are going in opposite directions by having a different
port number for RDMA aware and RDMA unaware versions of the ULP.
This way, ULP "connection manager" handles RDMA-ness under the covers,
while users plug an IP address for a server to connect to.
Thanks,
