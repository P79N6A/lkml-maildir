Git is distributed. The repository is everywhere. No server is actually needed.
Many use one anyway since it can be convenient. It's not, however, necessary.

No, that's CVS, SVN and other centralized scm's. With git you have perfect
version control on each peer. That's the entire idea behind "fully
distributed".

How is that different from what every SCM, including git, is doing today? The
user needs to tell the scm when it's time to take a snapshot of the current
state. Git is distributed though, so committing is usually not the same as
publishing. Is that lack of a single command to commit and publish what's
nagging you? If it's not, I completely fail to see what you're getting at,
unless you've only ever looked at repositories without a worktree attached,
or you think that git should work like an editor's "undo" functionality,
which would be quite insane.
