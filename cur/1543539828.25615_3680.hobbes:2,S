Subject: Rebuilt 2.2.12-20 ALWAYS crashes in kmem_cache_grow()

2.2.12-20 runs fine when installed from a CD on my Toshiba 4300 notebook
For some reason, I cannot re-compile and boot successfully into Linux
on my new Toshiba 4300 running 2.2.12-20, even though I've successfully
rebuilt this kernel on another PIII machine several times.
I do make xconfig, and select what seem to be reasonable options,
then I do ' make dep clean modules modules_install bzlilo'
When I reboot into the new kernal, it is loaded decompresses,
and very quickly crashes in kmem_cache_grow() + 36c.
Are there some special options I may need to be setting?
How can I quickly diagnose this?
Thanks in advance,
Paul
