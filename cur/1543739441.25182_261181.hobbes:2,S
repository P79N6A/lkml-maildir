the dependencies here are a bit complex due to the
various compile-time and runtime flags, and various
architecture call-ins to softirq.c.

___do_softirq() is the 'lowest level' softirq function, it
directly executes the handlers.
__do_softirq() disables bhs and calls ___do_softirq() - this
is the 'direct' softirq execution model, this function is
called by hardirq contexts and by softirqd. [btw., irqd calls
this function too which is a bit pointless.] In the indirect
execution model (SOFTIRQ_PREEMPT) this function does no softirq
execution, it only wakes up softirqd.
_do_softirq() is what is called by softirqd - dependent on the
execution model this function will either execute ___do_softirq()
[no additional locking or bh disabling] in the threaded case,
while in the direct case it will execute __do_softirq().
so the logic seems to be correct to me. (except for the minor
detail of irqd calling __do_softirq() which doesnt make much 
sense but which is harmless otherwise.)
with DEBUG_PREEMPT it is relatively safe to call ___do_softirq()
from softirqd (without doing the extra bh disabling), because
the two main rules of softirqs are still preserved:
 1) softirq execution doesnt reenter itself
 2) per-CPU assumptions safely detected
