   Its quite amusing, in email Brian F. Feldman <green@FreeBSD.org> is
   quite insistent that Alan "stole bsd code". Actually I wonder if
   thats actionable libel.
Check some of their changelogs to in_pcb.c and in_pcb.h, note the
entry where the socket hashing function changes somewhere between 1
and 2 years ago, it even outright credits me with the idea from the
Linux socket hashing function.  And honestly I don't care, there is no
reason to care, this discussion is pointless.
This conversation is offtopic and going nowhere fast, can people take
it somewhere else?
Later,
