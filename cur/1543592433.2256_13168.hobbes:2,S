This is exactly what gets fixed in the patch I sent you.
Feel free to reimplement it in a complex way if you want ;)

Won't work if the ethernet card is allocating memory
at gigabit speed. And no, my patch won't protect against
this thing either, only memory reservations can.
All my patch does is give us a 2.4 kernel now which
doesn't hang immediately as soon as you run on highmem
machines with a heavy swapping load.

Rik
