I'm not surprised, contrarly to speedstep-smi, speedstep-ich has been 
working with ondemand for quite a long time, since commit 
1a10760c91c394dfe4adfefeeaf85cd8098c4894 precisely :-) As stated in the 
commit message, the latency transition is about 200µs, much smaller than 
the 10ms required by ondemand. Actually, on my laptop the transition 
time is set to even higher due to problems of measurement, but it's 
still fine for ondemand. I get this at boot:
speedstep: frequency transition measured seems out of range (4800 nSec), 
falling back to a safe one of 500000 nSec.
See you,
Eric
