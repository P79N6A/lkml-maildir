Sorry, you didn't have the time to make it short and I don't have the
time to read it all. ;)
Anyway, it sounds as if you really want a connect_files() or similar
that shortens a chain of pipes.  Similar to removing an element from a
doubly linked list.  Should be possible and not too hard either, iff
you can point to a decent user.
Right now, I don't care at all since it is just an optimization for
what's possible in userspace already and is rarely used.  Root of all
evil an such...
