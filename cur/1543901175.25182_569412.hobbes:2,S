Sounds rather confusing.
This is how I see it:
  initrd=initrd.img.gz implies root=rootfs
  rdinit=/bin/sh is the special init=/bin/sh for initrd.
Both initrd/root and rdinit/init must be separate for pivoting to succeed.  
If you want to drop into the initrd (i.e. rootfs), then instruct your 
initrd.img.gz not to pivot (i.e. not over-mount another filesystem).
Thanks!
