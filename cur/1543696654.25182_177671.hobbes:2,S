Speaking of /proc/interrupts...
Does anybody else find hw_interrupt_type.typename lacking?
"XT-PIC" doesn't tell us if it is level or edge triggered, high or low
polarity.
"IO-APIC-edge" and "IO-APIC-level" don't tell us if it is high or low
polarity.
Having this info easily available in /proc/interrupts would make
recognizing and diagnosing interrupt configuration issues much easier.
thanks,
