But, it's not helping me aparently.  This morning the system would no
longer boot.  I got a call from my SO while I was driving home from
work today (my commute is 240 miles round trip) so I tried to talk her
through putting grub back on the system.  Somehow the drive ended up
getting formatted, and now I'm back at square one.  Unfortunately this
time the linux lba32 boot is no longer working.  It won't recognize
either of the drives as being more than 8 gig.
I suspect this is a motherboard/bios issue, the motherboard is an
ECS 'K7S5A Pro'. (www.ecsusa.com), the bios is an AMIBIOS simple setup
utility Version 1.21.11.  The distro is redhat 9 straight off of the
CD.  There doesn't seem to be anything on it to select large LBAs.
Any help would be greatly appreciated even a "I know that mobo is no
good with linux, get another one" would be useful since we've only had
it a couple of weeks and could probably return it.  (Which I would
have done already, except that it was the only one Frys carried that
would take the brand new SDram (not DDR) we bought for the previous
motherboard which then proceeded to smoke after the next power hit.
(Yes, I've been having a very frustrating month with the SO's
computer.))
