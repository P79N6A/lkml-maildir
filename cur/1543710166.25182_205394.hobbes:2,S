You also don't have a clue what replying below is all about nor do you
respond to anything regarding quotes. How many times haven't we seen
stupid quotes like this :
 > blah blah long long line ..........................
end of last line > here is the second line that's quoted
end of second line......... > and here starts the third one.
If you haven't - lucky you. But don't try to push your
reply-above-and-don't-give-a-piss-about-others approach.
This list replies below and uses manually wrapped lines.
If you want to create your own linux kernel list with other
rules - be free to do so, but if you want to continue talking
on this one, follow the rules on it, don't try to push your own.
