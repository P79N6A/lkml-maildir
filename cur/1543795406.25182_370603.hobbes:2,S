With arbitary desktop/laptop/etc. vendors it's pretty hopeless I agree.
But I suspect there is a chance at least on the server side. There
is only a limited number of companies working on server BIOSes 
for their boards and they tend to be more receptive to Linux's need
because it's now a significant part of their market.
And it's clearly an obviously useful "RAS feature" which is
fully buzzword compatible and everything.
IMHO it's time that Linux gets more proactive regarding talking
to BIOS vendors. Perhaps a generic "BIOS writers guide for Linux"
would be a good thing.  I have at least one other extension I would like
BIOS vendors to support. Just would need to come up with a writeup
for a clearly defined specification.
