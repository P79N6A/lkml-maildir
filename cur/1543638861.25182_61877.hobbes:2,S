OK now an interresting part.
- Split up the handling of SG list setup, so we can now handle the
   TRM-290, which is using a custom physical layout better.
   The BIO code for detecting sectors crossing sector size boundaries
   is still, well somehow flaky. One thing for example is that the PIIX4
   docu states cleanly that all SG list entires should be double word
   aligned, but we don't see any code there to maintain this property.
   Purly accidentally the kernel allocation code is maintaining cache
   boundaries, which makes this code work accidentally right now :-/
   We will target this next.
- Make some local stuff properly tagged as static. Review the host
   controller code for such occurencies.
- Actually use blk_insert_request() in ide_raw_taskfile. Use a
   preallocated structure there for REQ_SPECIAL requests to avoid
   passing down values residing on the stack.
- Open code ata_start_dma() to make the host controller drivers more
   independant from the generic code. We don't have anything chipset
   specific in pcidma.c anylonger.
