Gene, this happens almost every kernel version. You should know that binary 
drivers are OT for LKML, and if you want to report the problem you go through 
the linux-bugs@nvidia.com address clearly printed in the driver 
documentation, and on their website.
(As it turns out, the fix is very easy and you could easily fix it yourself. 
Just run --extract-only on the installer and poke around the affected files, 
removing the extra "NULL" argument to kmem_cache_create().)
