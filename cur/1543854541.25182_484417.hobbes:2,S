The "original" one never had such fields.  Even the efirtc.c
code (which originated those flags) didn't call them that;
it used "Enabled" not "alrm_enabled", so at least this patch
moves closer to that "original" behavior.

That's an orthgonal issue.  (Though one can argue that the
procfs file should be /proc/driver/rtc0 etc, one per RTC,
rather than /proc/driver/rtc...)

There shouldn't be any code parsing /proc/driver/rtc ... if there
is such stuff, it's already got so many variants to cope with that
adding one that actually matches the rest of the system would be
a net simplification.

The whole RTC framework is still labeled "experimental", and
AFAIK I'm the first person to audit the use of those flags.
Until it's no longer experimental, I have a hard time thinking
that backwards compatibility should prevent fixing such interface
bugs ... interface bugs are normally in the "fix ASAP" category,
since if you delay fixing them the costs grow exponentially.
