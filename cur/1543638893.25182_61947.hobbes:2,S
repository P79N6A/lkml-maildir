Hi,
is there a a way to clear the dentry and inode cache via proc interface ?
Sometimes all the clients of our groups have problems with stale nfs file 
handles (and currently also UNFSD/ClusterNFS problems, though this will 
finish soon), and we (the admins) think that this could be solved by clearing 
the cache -- please correct me if I'm wrong.
Thanks in advance,
Bernd
