Please put the branch name at the end of the line of thigns to pull, so 
that I can just cut-and-paste the whole line rather than potentially miss 
the fact that you named a specific branch.
And no, I've never been careless enough to miss it _yet_ (at least not 
without noticing that the end result was unexpected), but I don't want to 
even worry about it.
