This is not a reason.  The reason is that preemption usually works worse
on servers, esp. high-loaded servers - the more often you interrupt a
(kernel) work, the more nedleess context switches you'll have, and the
more slow the whole thing works.
Another point is that with preemption enabled, we have more chances to
hit one or another bug somewhere.  Those bugs should be found and fixed
for sure, but important servers/data isn't a place usually for bughunting.
