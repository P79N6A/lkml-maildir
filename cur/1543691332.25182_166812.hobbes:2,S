Basically we don't want a large unsigned return value to be
misinterpreted as a syscall failure because it looks like
a small negative number.
From David's description of the 2.5 patch (the link above has
the explanation):
Many architectures (alpha, ia64, ppc, ppc64, sparc, and sparc64 at least)
use a syscall convention which provides for a return value and a separate
error flag.  On those architectures, it can be beneficial if the kernel
provides a mechanism to signal that a syscall call has completed
successfully, even when the returned value is potentially a (small)
negative number.  The patch below provides a hook for such a mechanism via
a macro called force_successful_syscall_return().  On x86, this would be
simply a no-op (because on x86, user-level has to be hacked to handle such
cases).
