Hi Alan & others,
I am a newbie in field of PXE. I went through the entire thread. An
interesting discussion. 
Well I got a chance to hands on Universal Protocol Driver itself. I am
trying to implement the same. The objective of this driver is same as
suggested by Daniel. 
Still I am mentioning what we are trying here: -
1. Write a minimal Network driver, which will run on kernel and use only
PXE API for sending/receiving the packets over the network. 
2. The driver will provide only basic functionalities like just send and
receive the packets. NO performance talks please.
3. Please note that this driver is not intended to use in network
booting task.
4. So logically this driver will work on all the NICs which compliance
with PXE specifications. Our present target is PXE 2.1 specification.
With the above mentioned information, at present we are able to achieve
following: -
1. Identification of !PXE structure and API calling is OK.
2. Sending packet also OK.
3. We are facing issues in receive packet part. Specially interrupt is
not received on irq line (returned by PXE API
PXENV_UNDI_GET_INFORMATION).
With all this information, please find my replies inline: -

I am sorry but I am not clear regarding this, do you want to say PXE
specification is lacking some functionality ?

I have used 16:16 only, and so far I think it is OK to use. Have you
found any problem in 16:16? If yes please let us know. I have used it in
protected mode only. And yes I have not tested on too many NICs. So my
knowledge here is very limited.

primary test of packet send are OK with us. Yes I am not planning to use
DMA like things. 
Well having all the useful info from your e-mail we just want to know,
do you think that it is technically not possible to have such driver.
Please provide your valuable feedback and comments on same.
