There are separators to make sections of similar tests, but still not a
nifty "per-type" sections organization.
I would like to improve it and use percents and such instead of simple
"Vulnerable" and "Not vulnerable" results, so, you can have a global
idea of the current security status.
Patches are welcome, as I don't have a lot of time now (school "normal"
rhythm started this week).
Cheers,
