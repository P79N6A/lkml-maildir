I was looking through the official spec on the IBM 120gxp drives (looking for
more info on the 333hr/mo thing) when the following sentence jumped out at me.
"To prevent loss of customer data, it is recommended that the last write access
before power off be issued after setting the write cache off."
I was curious if we're actually doing this when someone issues a shutdown
command. Anyone know?
Just wondering,
Chris
