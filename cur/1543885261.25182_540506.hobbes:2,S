But we have our own *sane* version of WaitForMultipleObjects, and it's 
called poll(2).

So, on one side we have a proposal made by a set of new modular objects 
that fits our own infrastructure (internal - kernel, and external - POSIX) 
and that are not bound to a specific interface.
On the other side we have a completely new, monolitic interface, whose 
objects are strictly bound to it and are not usable if not only inside the 
interface itself.
Now, considering that POSIX is the backbone of Linux (and *nix in 
general), and considering that we certainly cannot drop existing POSIX 
semantics, where the lagacy code will come from?
I really do not understand your point. You're too smart to not appreciate 
the beauty and the simmetry of objects that responds to a common interface 
(our files, win32 handles), and that fits our existing kernel infrastructure.
