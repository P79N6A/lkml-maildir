the patch below fixes two yield()-usage bugs introduced by the new
scheduler. In the first O(1) scheduler iterations i've added TASK_YIELDED,
which made the setting of p->state unnecessery before calling yield(). But
later i cleaned up yield() further, again enabling the yielding of
non-running tasks. But the places which need to set p->state were not
reverted to the pre-TASK_YIELDED behavior.
the bug was seen live by Arjan van de Ven (in the 2.4 kernel), it causes
'stuck' shells under heavy IO and VM load.
