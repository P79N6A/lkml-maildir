buffer overflows do not break connections, and as such I think you are
out of luck.
Having said that.. on modern linux distros it's pretty hard to do a
buffer overflow exploit nowadays (NX[1] to make stacks non-executable,
randomisations, compiler based detection (via FORTIFY_SOURCE and/or
-fstackprotector)... add all those together and it's certainly not easy
to do this....
[1] or emulations of NX such as segment limits techniques
