well, it's somewhere in the [ granularity .. granularity*2 ] wall-clock 
scale. Basically the slowest way it can reach it is 'half speed' (two 
tasks running), the slowest way is 'near full speed' (lots of tasks 
running).

the current task is recalculated at scheduler tick time and put into the 
tree at its new position. At a million tasks the fair-clock will advance 
little (or not at all - which at these load levels is our smallest 
problem anyway) so during a scheduling tick in kernel/sched_fair.c 
update_curr() we will have a 'delta_mine' and 'delta_fair' of near zero 
and a 'delta_exec' of ~1 million, so curr->wait_runtime will be 
decreased at 'full speed': delta_exec-delta_mine, by almost a full tick. 
So preemption will occur every sched_granularity (rounded up to the next 
tick) points in time, in wall-clock time.
with 2 tasks running delta_exec-delta_mine is 0.5 million, so preemption 
will occur in 2*sched_granularity (rounded up to the next timer tick) 
wall-clock time.
