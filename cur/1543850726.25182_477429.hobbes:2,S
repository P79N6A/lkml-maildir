AFAIU, you wanted it applied on the top of the "non-working" kernel 
(2.6.19-rc2-ish)? No, it didn't work. And, worse yet, I think, it is after 
testing that patch that the interface got into a state, when netconsole 
worked, ping worked, but ssh didn't. A poweroff was needed to recover. In 
case you still need it, here's the info you requested:
00:0b.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8169 Gigabit Ethernet (rev 10)

dmesg when it didn't work (I do use netconsole, don't think it matters?):
r8169 Gigabit Ethernet driver 2.2LK loaded
eth0: RTL8169s/8110s at 0xc9004c00, 00:0d:0b:99:44:70, IRQ 16
netconsole: device eth0 not up yet, forcing it
r8169: eth0: link down
r8169: eth0: link up
The same when it's working.
Yes, just commenting out the line
	__rtl8169_set_mac_addr(dev, ioaddr);
fixes it (without the patch from your previous email).
Thanks
