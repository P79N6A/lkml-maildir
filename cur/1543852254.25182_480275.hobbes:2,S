True. However, as I said, we don't have to deprecate the old technique
right away, we have time to get the drivers fixed, provided we agree
that this is the way to go.

Yup, I might have a look. (Or maybe can you give accounts on a box I can
use ? That would be even easier)

Nah, my extension is fixed, it's just that it's defined by the arch. So
archs who don't care don't get the bloat.
Right now, my implementation just hijacks firmare_data, so it's a
pointer (and thus potentially could be variable size) but I want to have
it "flat" in for performances.
My current device_ext on powerpc is:
struct device_ext {
        /* Optional pointer to an OF device node */
        struct device_node      *of_node;
        /* DMA operations on that device */
        struct dma_mapping_ops  *dma_ops;
        void                    *dma_data;
        /* NUMA node if applicable */
        int                     numa_node;
};
If we remove plaform_data and firmware_data from struct device, then the
size difference is one pointer and one int, which isn't -that- much (for
powerpc, I consider that acceptable).
The idea is just to have asm/device.h do
struct device_ext {
};
That is, define an empty struct, for all archs that don't care about it,
though I want to move the dma_cohrerent_map thingy into the extension
for the 3 archs that seem to use it (x86, frv and m32.
Cheers,
Ben
