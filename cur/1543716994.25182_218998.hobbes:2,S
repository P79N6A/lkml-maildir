Sorry, rejects galore again :( There have been a number of changes to
dmi_scan.c since rc3-mm1.  They're probably in rc3-mm2, but it would be
best if you were to base these patches off Linus's latest tree, and we ask
Len to keep his paws off dmi_scan.c for a while.
It might be best to merge these patches via Len's tree anyway - I'll then
pick them up via his tree and they'll hit Linus's tree when Len does the
next ACPI merge?
