Subject: [PATCH] remove availability for PAGE_SIZE and friends (i386)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

After a bit of discussion I found out that PAGE_SIZE really shouldn't
be available for use at all by userspace. So here's a patch to move
the __KERNEL__ define to include PAGE_SIZE and friends for i386.
Thanks,
