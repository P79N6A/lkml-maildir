They all sound good. I like the notion of basing jiffies off of system
time, rather then interrupt counts. However, I'm a little cautious of
changing the meaning of jiffies too drastically. 
Right now jiffies has two core meanings:
1. Count of the number of timer ticks that have passed.
2. Accurate system uptime, measured in units of 1/HZ
(Let me know if I forgot any others)
The problem being, neither of those meaning are 100% true. 
#1 isn't true because when we loose timer ticks, we try to compensate
for them (i386 specifically). But at the same time #2 isn't true because
the timer interrupts don't necessarily run at exactly HZ (again, i386
specifically).
Basically due to our hardware constraints, we need to break one of these
two assumptions. The problem is which do we choose? 
Do we base jiffies off of monotonic_clock(), guaranteeing #2 and
possibly breaking anyone who is assuming #1? Or do we change all users
of jiffies for time to use monotonic_clock, guaranteeing #1, which will
require quite a bit of work.
And which choice makes it harder for folks to create tickless systems?
Its a tough call.
On top of that, we still have the issue that the current  interpolation
used in the time of day subsystem is broken (in my opinion), and we need
to fix that before we can have a reliable monotonic_clock. 
The joke being of course that I'll need to set my /etc/ntp/ntp.drift
file to 500 to find the time to work on any of this. And really, anyone
who really found that funny needs to go home.
thanks
