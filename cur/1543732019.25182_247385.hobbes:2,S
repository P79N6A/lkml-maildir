Bad to guess, there's a program called memburn which may also be used. 
It's doing testing in a different way and I just grabbed it because 
someone in comp.sys.intel reported finding problems which memtest didn't

I run firewall on a LOT of dual Xeon+HT and ran iptables firewall on 
dual P5-166 until it died. I don't think there are problems.
