Of course you need to keep your bootable medium protected, ot at least the
kernel. I think linux implements the concept of immutable files but I may
have the os:s mixed up.
It is a usability vs. security issue. You can tighten security immensly
through capabilities, but then you will have a much harder time as an
administrator.
