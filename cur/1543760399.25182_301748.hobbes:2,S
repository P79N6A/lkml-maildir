Perhaps.  The madvise() and numa calls (mbind, set_mempolicy) only
affect the current task, as is usually appropriate for calls that allow
specification of specific address ranges (strangers shouldn't be messing
in my address space).  Some external means to set default policy for
whole tasks seems to be needed, as well, which could well be via the
cpuset.
