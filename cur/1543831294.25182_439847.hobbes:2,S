gcc 4.1 and later have this feature yes.
HOWEVER the gcc people were not stupid, they did not force this on
people, they require you to put -fstack-protector on the commandline.
Debian and RH/Fedora do this.
If Ubuntu patched gcc rather than just putting it in the build
environment... then you should switch to a less braindead distribution
really ;)
or at least ask them to fix this.
