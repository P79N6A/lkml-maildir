	Yes, and I knew that when I wrote that - hence the 
parenthtical comment :-) In practice (and this is localized to an
internal network of a few hundred machines), I can track a
bandit to at least 95% accuracy.  Most of the time, it is a
secretary who played the 
my-address-is-taken-so-I'll-just-choose-one-at-random game.  
For those times when the source cannot be determined accurately,
it is often someone who brought their laptop in for the day 
and "borrowed" an ethernet jack.

	Right, that is true.  And it is interesting to note that
the people saying that the Sun/SGI/etc. workstation sysid is
unique and secure apparently have not walked on the darker side of 
the net, where sysid 'modifiers' (probably requires access to kmem)
to allow trickery of flexlm run rampant.

	I would be wary of a web browser that did that anyhow, regardless
of what information it sought :-)
