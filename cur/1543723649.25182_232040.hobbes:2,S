Hi,
I have a problem with gcc 3.4, and kernel 2.6.6, i have every thing compiled and installed, no problems compiling, but when i'm going to load a kernel module, it gives me problems, with all the modules, the problem it's the same, and with gcc 3.3.3 i dont have problems, so it's gcc fault, my question it's, does kernel 2.6.7, have this solved?
Tks
