Ugh, this is all crackpot wishlist gunk.
How about some goodies backed with real working code, like:
* O(1) proc_pid_statm()
	-- originally by bcrl for 2.4, fwd port maintained by wli
* O(lg(n)) proc_pid_readdir()/proc_task_readdir()
	-- original O(1) proc_pid_readdir() by manfred, rewritten by
	-- wli to use rbtrees for O(lg(n)) seeks into the relevant
	-- lists (walking over empty buckets had overhead)
* 4KB ia32 kernel stacks + irqstacks
	-- original by bcrl, fwd port maintained by dhansen for a
	-- substantial amount of time, now maintained by wli
* ia32 leaf pagetable node cache
	-- wli
* node-local per_cpu areas for ia32 NUMA
	-- wli
* highpmd, analogue of highpte for pmd's
	-- wli. Gets pmd's on node-local mem on ia32 NUMA, and
	-- alleviates a lot of lowmem pressure under heavy
	-- multiprogramming levels on PAE.
Some benchmarks of a patchset including these (and several other things)
are at 
http://home.earthlink.net/~rwhron/kernel/wli.html,
 and some ports
of the patch set are at 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/people/wli/kernels/
Whatever fantasy may be worth, working code is worth a lot more. I'll
refrain from mentioning prototype-quality patches I'm hacking on atm.
