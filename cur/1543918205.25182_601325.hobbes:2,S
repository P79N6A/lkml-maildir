Please explain what you're proposing again, because my memory of your
plan from last time wouldn't help in this case.  Are you proposing that
the bzImage contains compressed data that its expecting the bootloader
to decompress?  Won't that completely break backwards compatibility?  If
we don't care about backwards compatibility with old bootloaders, then
it doesn't matter what we do one way or the other.
