What is the most "correct" way to alias ip addresses to ethernet devices?
From all the documentation it says you should alias IP's to ethX:X but what
if you have a multihomed machine?  I would guess aliasing the IP's to lo:X
would be better, but does that cause any problems (routing/arp)?  How does
Linux handle IP's aliased on lo?
