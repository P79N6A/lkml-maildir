Yes.  That was stipulated.

Perhaps you might read up on unfair trade practices and contract law. 
The contract (GPL) doesn't prevent me from using GPL work, in fact it
encourages me.  Neither can it impose conditions upon original work
authored by a third party.
You do realise, I suppose, that it's easily feasible to write a Linux
kernel module on a non-Linux platform, and in fact without even using
any GPL software in its production.  How could such a work possibly be
derivative?  How could it be affected by GPL?
And please, don't give wishy-washy "lawyers tell me it's so"
non-answers.  Give something real.
