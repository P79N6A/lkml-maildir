It is common to use many threads per processor on some operating
systems. But this is (in my experience) because of the lack of proper
non-blocking APIs on said OS.
You can emulate non-blocking APIs with threads and a blocking API. And
on some systems you simply have to.
On GNU/Linux this is not generally a problem.  And as Marco said, you
really shouldn't have to do that.
