I don't think you can assume that the request processing in the host
is ordered without sychronization. Everything you queue in your worker
thread is serialized by that. Everything else is out of your control and each
thread may be scheduled or not.
Maybe we have certain guarantees through DM or the block I/O layer, that
I don't know. Can somebody else step in here?
Best,
Jens
