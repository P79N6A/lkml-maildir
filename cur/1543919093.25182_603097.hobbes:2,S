On 32-bit platform such as i386. Some memory zones have no kernel
virtual mapping (highmem region etc). So I think this may be useful as a
universal way to access physical memory. But it can be more efficient to
implement it in arch file for some arch. Should this implementation be
used as a fall back implementation with attribute "weak"?

OK, I will add the document in the next version.
