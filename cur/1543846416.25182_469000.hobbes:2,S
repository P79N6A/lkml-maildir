Hi,
in general linux should be ok with this happening. However for specific
cases... you'll need to provide more information; you're not mentioning
which drivers you are using for example. Or even which versions of the
kernel etc etc....
(also: if you actually HIT throttling, there is something very very
wrong; you're not supposed to hit that unless the fan is defective, but
never in "normal" healthy operation. If you do hit it without hardware
defects then there is most likely a fundamental airflow problem you'll
want to fix urgently)
