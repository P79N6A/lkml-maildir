It might be a valid point that you want to leave the door open to using
a different (than SHA1) digest.  (So this means you going to store it
as an ASCII string, right?)
But I don't see how that applies here.  Any optimization that avoids
rereading old versions if the digests match will never trigger on the
day you change digests.  No problem here - you doomed to reread the old
version in any case.
Either you got your logic backwards, or I need another cup of coffee.
