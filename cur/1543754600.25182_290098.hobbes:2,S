They can look at the modules in /lib/modules/$(uname -r).

I find the autoinstaller feature quite scary.

DKMS doesn't manage loading modules, does it? If it does, then at least
it shouldn't; that's even more scary than the autoinstaller. From the
point of view of the kernel, the modules relevant for the running kernel
are those below /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/. If DKMS replaces things
there, it'd better keep proper track of what it did.
I never want to see DKMS try to remove a module from the running kernel
or insmod a new one.

That's something you can do entirely in userspace by looking at the *.ko
files.
