In terms of the MIPS{32|64} ISA, the current primitives seem fine;
there's only 1 option defined in the ISA:  'sync'.  Order for all
off-cache accesses is guaranteed around a sync.
It gets a bit more complicated when you talk about what particular
implementations do, and ordering rules for uncached vs cached accesses,
but to the best of my knowledge there aren't any fundamental problems as
described for the PPC.
