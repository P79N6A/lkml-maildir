Hi,
I send this mail because I'm trying to compile the 2.4.0 or 2.4.0-testX
kernels with no success.
The most strange is that when I compile the kernel everything works fine
(without errors). Therefore, when I select this kernel to boot, it don't
work (it freeze).
It say
                  Unpacking kernel ..... OK.
And then stop.
I'm working in a RedHat 6.X and it just happen in 2.4.X kernels.
What can be wrong ? Exists any special requirements to this kernels ?
I'll thanks so much your comments.
Regards.
