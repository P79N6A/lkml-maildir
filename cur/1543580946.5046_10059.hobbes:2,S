I waited out the boot so I could login and experiment, but it was
painfully slow.
Compiling with just APM in and no ACPI, results in a correctly-running
machine with rh7 gcc-2.96-69.
I got lucky this time that with APM worked, else I'd be stuck with slowly
fscking, since this last boot I had to fsck two of my partitions (maximum
mount count exceeded...)  I don't even want to know how long it'd take to
fsck my almost 60GB worth of disks on this machine...  If that were the
case, I guess I'd be better off fscking with 2.4.0 and then coming back
in... ouch.
