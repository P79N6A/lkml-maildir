Right. I don't why but I got the implression Ingo's threadlet_exec example 
was just sketch code to be moved in a syscall. That's why I was talking 
about a sys_threadlet_exec. But yeah, it makes a lot of sense to turn 
threadlet_exec in a glibc thing, and play everything in userspace at that 
point.
