I've since disabled CONFIG_PREEMPT in an attempt to see if ti fixes a full 
system freeze I've been seeing ove the last few days (3 freezes in 24 hrs but 
nothing on a serial console).
It seems to be behaving from that regard.
Copying a couple of ISO images (~650MB each) from a USB2 drive (LaCie 1TB 
disk) to the Raid has practically tied up the system again.
X is so unresponsive that I've managed to type the last paragraph before it 
hit the screen...
Once the copy has finished and caches have been synced to disk, the system 
becomes more lively again, but my P3/1.2Ghz/256MB laptop with an old 20GB 
disk is able to remain fully responsive when I copy the same set of isos over 
the network.
I have an LSI Logic Megaraid SATA raid card on order from my supplier so I'll 
be sticking it into another identical system to run some more tests, although 
I suspect it will confirm that its the 3Ware rather than the system thats the 
bottleneck.
Out of interest Jason, do you have the 3Ware plugged into a 64bit or 32bit pci 
slot?
Mark.
