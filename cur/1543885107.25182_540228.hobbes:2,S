Done. Indeed, this fixed the issue. Thanks!
The interesting thing is that I *thought* I had it off, as I had never
touched this menu or set a password on it. The manual said that the board
would not be accessible from the network until I set a password, which I
had (incorrectly) assumed to mean the ME feature would be off. To turn off
the option (or even see I had it on) I had to google for the default
ME password, which turned out to be 'admin'.
Thanks for the help,
