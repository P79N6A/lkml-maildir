Can a PCI Express expert enlighten me on how VGA support happens on
PCI Express?
1) Does VGA work on PCI Express?
2) Is it routed at bridges like x86 PCI?
3) Or does each bridge have it's own legacy space like PCI on 64b machines?
4) How are other things like serial ports handled?
5) What about the VGA memory window at A000:0?
