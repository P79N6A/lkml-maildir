Subject: [patch 2/2] acpi: add ability to derive irq when doing a surprise removal of an adapter
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/7/174

If an adapter is surprise removed, the interrupt pin must be guessed, as
any attempts to read it would obviously be invalid.  cycle through all
possible interrupt pin values until we can either lookup or derive the
right irq to disable.
