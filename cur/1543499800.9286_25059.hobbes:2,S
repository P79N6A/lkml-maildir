But then you have a journaling object store _and_ some method for the 
OS to determine dependency chains in arbitrary objects. Even on a single
computer, this is hard. Object D is a "directory" object exporting
methods for accessing objects listed in the directory. One of those objects,
object R is a relational database table that references object R' a second
table, not listed within D, and also has some dynamic content provided by
object C also not listed in D. We now "move" the listing of R to D' and
ask the OS to "write D and D' and all their dependents atomically!
Simple as pie -- especially if D' is over the network. 
State is hard. Much of academic CS over the last 20 years is an effort
to hide state and hope that what you don't see won't bite you. (EROS 
is has some good ideas, but I verymuch doubt Shapiro would argue that it
makes state complexity disappear).

Yes. In different domains, different paradigms make great sense.

But the OS, in your scheme, must accomodate the most complex cases.

Because it uses a simple bottom layer in a clever way.
