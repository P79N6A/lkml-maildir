Those differences were caused by your own action: the amount of time 
between insmod uhci-hcd.ko and plugging in the keyboard.  In the first 
test the time was long enough for the root hub to be autosuspended; in the 
second test it wasn't.  As a result, the first test includes the sequences 
used in waking up the root hub.

Those differences were just accidents of timing.  The driver has a kernel
timer that fires every 250 ms.  In the first test it happened to fire in
the middle of an update sequence and in the second test it didn't.

And that difference, of course, is the failure we're trying to fix.  It is 
the NumLock-release message from the keyboard.  So we haven't learned 
anything.

I did manage to think of something else for you to try.  It may help pin 
down the source of the problem.
In drivers/usb/host/uhci-q.c, near the start is a function named
uhci_fsbr_on().  Put a "return" statement right at its beginning so that
the function doesn't do anything.  Does that make any difference?
