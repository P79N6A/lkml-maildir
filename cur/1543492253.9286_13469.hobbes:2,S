Subject: Bug in unix.o as a module?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I've used unix.o as a module for at least a year now (well, ever since you
could actually compile it and use it as a module anyway).  Periodically I've
noticed the following problem:
% xedit
_X11TransSocketUNIXConnect: Can't connect: errno = 111
I'm of course prevented from starting any other X client as well.
This time I've also noticed:
% /sbin/lsmod | grep unix
unix                   10132  73  (autoclean)
Would this be an X server bug or is there a problem with the kernel?
Relevant version numbers: XFree86 3.3.3, Linux 2.2.4, gcc 2.7.2.3.f.1.  If
memory serves I've also seen this problem with other versions of all three,
though.
