Yes, that's one of leading reasons for wanting rmap.  (Number one and two 
reasons are: allow forcible unmapping of multiply referenced pages for 
swapout; get more reliable hardware ref bit readings.)
Note that even if we can do forcible freeing we still have to deal with the 
issue of fragmentation due to pinned pages, e.g., slab cache, admittedly a 
rarer problem.
