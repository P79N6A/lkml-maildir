At a first approximation, ATI/AMD devices don't send any interrupts if 
intx is disabled, nVidia devices send legacy interrupts in addition to MSI 
ones if intx isn't disabled, and Intel devices actually work correctly. So 
we need at least one kind of device quirk for intx and msi. (And doing it 
in the drivers doesn't work, since everybody is making things driven by 
snd_hda_intel and would like msi, afaict)
