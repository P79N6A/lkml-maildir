Hi!
What is it that in_atomic counts? Obviously spinlocks and
get_cpu/put_cpu. Anything else?
Is there easy way to find out which spinlock causes "scheduling in
atomic" warning? [It happens a *lot* in swsusp].
I'm doing spin_lock_irqsave() then in another function
spin_unlock_irqrestore. Is that okay? If no, can it cause "scheduling
in atomic"?
