Current design is:
Twice. Once during snapshot (then we spin it up when the snapshot is
done), and once during shutdown.
Yep, we optimize away spindown, because it takes too long, so SCSI
disks are actually very bad example.

No, I'd like you to understand that we actually CAN tell the disks to
spin down, because we'll call resume and spin them back again before
writing the image. We used to do it. We still can do it, but it is
slow.
Yes, it is quite confusing.
