    Now I'm really curious, because the machines I'm putting them
    are pretty close to exclusively VIA-based, and the only downtime
    the any of them have had (in the past 90 days, which is when I
    got the 8-pack and started installing the chips) have been when
    nfsd jammed up talking to a AIX machine and I had to reboot the
    file server to get socket 2049 out of CLOSE_WAIT.
    We are talking about the same tulips and VIA chipsets, I hope?
    The Netgear cards I've got have one nearly tulip sized chip
    on them titled:
			NETGEAR
			NGMC1698
			9843
			AN6258.1
    which is described in hinv (on the server, which I'll describe
    exclusively, because it's been running longest and has the most
    to lose if the card turns out to be icky) as
		  eth0: Lite-On 82c168 PNIC
		  eth0:  MII transceiver found
    And the VIA chipset I've got on the motherboards (FIC PA2013)
    is Vendor id 1106, Device id 586, which dmesg reports as
	ide: VT82C586 VXPRO+ (Apollo) on PCI bus 0 function 57 
	ide0: BM-DMA at 0x6400-0x6407
	    ide1: BM-DMA at 0x6408-0x640f
	    hda: IBM-DTTA-351350, 8063MB w/464kB Cache, CHS=1644/255/63, DMA
	    hdc: IBM-DTTA-351350, 8063MB w/464kB Cache, CHS=16383/16/63, DMA
    Of course, I'm not running 2.2.x on this machine;  I'm running a much
    hacked 2.0.28, with the startup logo patch, the Webshield "this is Unix,
    so yes it's okay to have network modules autoprobe" patch, one of the
    VIA chipset DMA patches, my new.new.memory patch, a patch so that the
    IDE driver doesn't screw up disk geometry by trying to outguess the
    IBM drives, and a large crop of additional and backported 2.0.3x and
    2.2.x drivers (including the netgear-tweaked tulip.c)
    The hardware on this machine is pretty simple:
	    400mb core
	    AMD K6/333
	    the netgear card
	    FIC PA-2013 mb (1mb cache)
	    BusLogic 958, driving a Sony SDT9000 and Exabyte 8505
	    2 IBM 13.5gb IDE drives
	    some throwaway Intel 740 AGP video card (the machine runs
	    in text mode, using SVGATextMode to get a satisfying 20x9
	    character cell.)
    And the network topology is:
	[this box] ---100mb/full dup--- [netgear switch] -- firewall --- dmz
					 ||||||  ||||||
					 Wad of  Wad of NT machines,
					 Unix    talking SAMBA.
					 machines
					 (SGI, HP, IBM, DEC)
					 talking nfs to
					 this box, because
					 /home is mounted
					 from here.
    With this box providing
	home directories
	mail
	the public ftp site
	the public web site
	dns for the internal network
    So, as you can see, I'm rather surprised to hear that this particular
    combination of hardware is BAD, given that it's not yet bitten me in
    the ass.
                  ____
    david parsons \bi/ And since Netgear is shipping Linux drivers with their
                   \/       hardware, guess who's getting all my business for
			 ethernet cards?  It would be distressing if all this
			                                      suddenly failed.
