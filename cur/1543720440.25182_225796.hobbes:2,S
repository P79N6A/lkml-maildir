To give some background, the libusb backend of pilot-link is a slightly
odd design, we do the init work, reset the device, and then setup a read
thread, which basicly does a continuous loop of bulk no-timeout reads
from USB.
In the primary thread we do most of the work, including doing the USB
bulk writes to do things like ask the pilot for information.
Which, once I had things working again, sometimes resulted in the
following issue:
lt-pilot-xfer D 00000010     0  3351   3097  3398               (NOTLB)

With the device not sending us any more data until it receives the
write, and the write not getting to send until the bulk read finishes or
the device goes away.
With the predictable annoyance this causes, of course.

  Yes, Java is so bulletproofed that to a C programmer it feels like
being in a straightjacket, but it's a really comfy and warm
straightjacket, and the world would be a safer place if everyone was
straightjacketed most of the time.        -- Overheard in the SDM.
