See my reply, which passed yours in-flight :)
I'm OK with all the changes, but ->cable_detect (and _nice_ cleanups) 
does not seem like 2.6.21-rc bugfix material to me.
We definitely want the IDENTIFY ordering changes, though we'll also want 
that passed through at least one more 2.6.21-rcX release before 
confidence appears.
That little change, buried in the middle of Alan's patch, changes the 
probing order for a /lot/ of devices, possibly millions, when you 
consider that it changes behavior of ata_piix (Intel SATA) as well as 
all the not-yet-default PATA controllers.
A wanted fix, but something that definitely wants a lot of public 
testing before 2.6.21 release.
