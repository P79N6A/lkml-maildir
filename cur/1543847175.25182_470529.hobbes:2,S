It is just a legacy bug that we have to live with. Newer chipsets will
have the correct format in the BIOS.
With the latest forcedeth driver and latest PXE you should not have any
issues.

Ayaz,
Can you explain the whole "reverse-order MAC address" thing?
Why/how does it end-up in that register backwards in the first place?
Does it serve some purpose that way?  Or is it just a bug that we
have to live with?
John
