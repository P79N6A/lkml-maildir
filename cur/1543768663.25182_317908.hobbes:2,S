 Hello, guys.
 Here's mtkdiff 20050513.  Changes are
 * tarball name changed to mtkdiff from gitkdiff
 * gitkdiff modified to use the new git-* commands
 * gitkdiff no automtically locates git repository root, so you can
   execute it from any sub-directory.
 * quiltkdiff added.  It shows all the patches in the series with
   mtkdiff.
 * gitgrep added.  This isn't really related to mtkdiff or git, but
   I use it all the time and didn't wanna put it separately. :-)
