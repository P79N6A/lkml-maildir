We have provided a (test) driver which allows e100 to use IO to communicate with 
the device, which seems to have helped for one person. I think we need to work 
with those changes and see if it helps the other people resolve their e100 
issues. Unfortunately it keeps slipping off to the low priority list for us.
I suggest that we should push this code into -mm for people to test or 
something. It's fairly low risk as by default the patch won't enable IO and thus 
use the old method of writing to the adapter.
