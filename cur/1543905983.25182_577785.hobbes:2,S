The kexec-tools version 1.101 does not work perfectly with relocatable
kernel. This would have been solved if I worked against kexec-tools
testing tree. I will work against testing tree in the next version.
But, with some trick, it can work. When configure kernel, make sure the
following option is set:
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x4000000 # if crashkernel=<XX>M@64M
