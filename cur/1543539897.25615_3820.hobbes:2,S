James,
Please stop....
I have explained to others
The current only allows for part of the taskfile command to be accessed.
The very thing you are whining about can not be done in this limited but
dangerous access.
You want to update the drive, YOU CAN'T.
You want to hurt the drive , YOU CAN.
You want to fix the hurt, YOU CAN'T.
There are more positive things YOU CAN'T do because the current IOCTL will
not let you do.........thus the full extention is needed....
It goes on.........
Please just let it all die.........
I have more important things to than fight this fight.
Most people have filtered the subjects, so you would have to rotate that
line........
Nobody cares......
