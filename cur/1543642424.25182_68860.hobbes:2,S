No, but I didn't expect throughput to drop by 40% or so either,
which is (very roughly) what happened. Interrupts are a pain to
manage and do affinity with, so NAPI should (at least in theory)
be better for this kind of setup ... I think.

Ah, but that's not really our goal - what we're trying to do is
use specweb as a tool to simulate a semi-realistic customer
workload, and improve the Linux kernel performance, using that
as our yardstick for measuring ourselves. For that I like the
setup we have reasonably well, even though it won't get us the
best numbers.
To get the best benchmark numbers, you're absolutely right though.
