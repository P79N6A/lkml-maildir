Hello, 
I have a bug on an Alpha ES40 SMP 2.4.4.ac3 modified (TCP Bug from lkml)
Platform:
Linux Version:
-----------------------
My kernel is 2.4.4-ac3 with the tcp.c file modified as suggested by the
following patch.
>I see! Dave, please, take the second Andrea's patch (appended).
>It is really the cleanest one.

This time, to show that it has nothing to do with the ftp server I used a
simple
rcp:
Experiment 1:
----------------------
 ES40-06					ES40-05
 rcp es40-05:/mnt/big/mid /tmp/toto		Machine fine
 with a mid file not too big (1.4Megabytes) everything is fine
 
Experiment 2:
----------------------
 ES40-06					ES40-05
 rcp es40-05:/mnt/big/1Giga /tmp/toto		Machine frozen
 the ES40-06 managed to retrieve only 11 Mbytes so I guess I can start again
with a 12 Megabytes file, It should trigger the bug.
Here is the log of the machine who crashed:

The next line is:
--------------------------
May  3 17:36:17 es40-05 syslogd 1.3-3: restart.
What could I do to be sure where the problem is ?
I tested the machine under high cpu load, memory, swap, combination of the
three.
The only thing that does not work under load is the network.... TCP/IP ?
Andrew Morton is pretty sure this has nothing to do with his driver...
Any ideas of how I could find where the problem is ?
Thx for any help.
