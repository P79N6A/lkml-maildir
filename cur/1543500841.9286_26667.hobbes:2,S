i don't know anybody doing *anything* with the K7 today... :) so i guess the
whole discussion is moot.
Interestingly the new *Alpha* 21264 UP1000 motherboard uses the AMD Irongate
chipset.. they also have a dual 21264 UP2000 board based on a DEC chipset.
So it seems K7/Alpha chipsets are interchangeable, so then K7 SMP is
probably possible using the DEC chipset.
