People are throwing money at the problem.  We're now at a point that in 
order to provide the interested people with something they can use, we 
need some kind of way to protect their applications against calling an 
unsuspecting new mmap syscall instead of the aio syscall specified in 
the kernel they compiled against.

What I'm saying is that for more people to play with it, it needs to be 
more widely available.  The set of developers that read linux-kernel and 
linux-aio aren't giving much feedback.  I do not expect the code to go 
into 2.5 at this point in time.  All I need is a set of syscall numbers 
that aren't going to change should this implementation stand up to the 
test of time.
