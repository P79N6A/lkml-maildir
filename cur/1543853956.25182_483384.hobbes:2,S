Sorry but I don't understand why B is said to be the new one. OK
I can see why from the bit of code you pointed out but from a
logical point of view (ok maybe be me only) I'm unmapping 'BBBB'
segment, so 'BBBB' is going to be destroyed and therefore A is
the new one. Thereferore I would expect close(B), open(A)...
no ?
