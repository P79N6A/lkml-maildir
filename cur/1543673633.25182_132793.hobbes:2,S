But you do know the type of the data in the blob... it's char* fsname,
const void* key and const void* data, according to your code. 
You do
void* blob = kmalloc(fsname size + key size + data size)
memcpy(blob, fsname, fsname size)
memcpy(blob + fsname offset, key, key size)
mempcy(blob + fsname offset + key offset, data, data size)
I suggest
struct fsblob { 
       const char* fsname; 
       const void* key; 
       size_t keysize; 
       const void* data; 
       size_t datasize; 
}; 
struct fsblob b; 
b->fsname = kmalloc(fsname size)
memcpy(b->fsname, fsname, fsname size)
etc. 
Your method loses on additional complexity, and wins on
speed. However, unless it's really, really speed sensitive code, I
would go for KISS any day.

My pleasure.
