Better yet, have a device or proc file that becomes readable in this case.
Then you can have a user-space demon to implement whatever policy you like.
The demon can mlock its pages, so it should be reasonably safe from causing
an OOM itself. Writing to that device/proc file could set the threshold for
when OOM recovery is necessary.
Reasonable policies may include enabling overflow swap space, SIGSTOP'ing
all processes above a certain size/growth rate, paging the administrator,
and opening a shell on the system console.
