Your ssh session should be allowed to run anyway. I don't see the difference.
If the runqueue length is 100 and the time-slice is (say) 10ms, then if your
ssh only needs average of 5ms of CPU time per second, then it should be run
next when it becomes runnable. If it wants 20ms of CPU time per second, then
it has to wait for 2 seconds anyway to be run next, regardless of whether
the timeslice was 10ms or 20ms.

That's silly. By definition if there is only one task running, you don't
care what the timeslice is.
We actually did conduct some benchmarks, and a 10ms timeslice can start
hurting even things like kbuild quite a bit.
But anyway, I don't care what the time slice is so much (although it should
be higher -- if the scheduler can't get good interactive behaviour with a
20-30ms timeslice in most cases then it's no good IMO). I care mostly that
the timeslice does not decrease when load increases.
