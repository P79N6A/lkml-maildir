People have reported numerous problems with the PCI bios on the netfinity,
where if PCI bios is used a while later the box crashes. However the RH
kernel is built to try and do direct PCI in favour of PCI bios32 calls.

You probably want to get hold of the ikd patch and/or the remote gdb
stubs for Linux 2.2.x (on ftp.gcom.com) - that lets you use one Linux
box to gdb another and do source level debug/stepping etc
