What does Xen have to do with that? I don't want to run stuff in another
virtual machine, just on my desktop. Also, no matter how good the
virtualization is, if the host eats CPU, the guest doesn't have it.

The standard was is to simply demote ill-behaved tasks to SCHED_OTHER or
suspend them temporarily, i.e. limit the percentage of CPU they can get
over a certain period of time.

Rare case? So you never use a VoIP app (sure they can work as non-rt,
but you get much better quality as latency goes down)? How about media
players that don't skip? There are lots of uses for low-latency (i.e. rt
scheduling) on a desktop. Pro audio people are the first to benefit, but
all users can see an improvement.

There *are* lots of people who want it and who have been complaining for
quite a while (see threads on linux-audio-dev). All that's missing is a
tiny bit, which makes it even more frustrating.

Sure, I can patch my kernel, but then the distros will just keep on
ignoring the problem, which is bad.
