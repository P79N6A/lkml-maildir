So, what exactly is the point here?  You want it to be GNU/SuSE/Linux
because it contains even one FSF/GNU tool?  Why not call it Vixie/Linux
'coz RedHat ships with Vixie cron and BIND?  When I use Linux, I use it
for the kernel and the general environment that is common to all Linux
distributions that I've worked with so far. I could run Solaris or FreeBSD
with a big pile of GNU software if I wanted to, but I don't think I'd like
that too much...
