.. and many never will, leading to about 900 unused ones, each taking
quite a bit of space.
Some are really stupid (eg sys_openat export is just braindead, sys_open
was temporarily exported until all in-kernel users were switched over to
the firmware loading api, sys_openat seems to just have blindly copied
this without thinking)

alternatively we should bite the bullet, and just stick those 900 on the
"we'll kill all these in 3 months" list, have a thing to disable them
now via a config option (so that people actually notice rather than just
having them in the depreciation file) and fix the 5 or 10 or so that
actually will be used soon in those 3 months.
