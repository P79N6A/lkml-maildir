Subject: [patch -mm 2/7] x86_64: split remaining fake nodes equally
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/1/265

Extends the numa=fake x86_64 command-line option to split the remaining
system memory into equal-sized nodes.
For example:
numa=fake=2*512,4*	gives two 512M nodes and the remaining system
			memory is split into four approximately equal
			chunks.
This is beneficial for systems where the exact size of RAM is unknown or
not necessarily relevant, but the granularity with which nodes shall be
allocated is known.
