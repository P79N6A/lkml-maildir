Hi *
I have one question: 
Since I´m running the new 2.2.1 on my AMD K6-2 300 3Dnow! my xosview
shows me 24 Interrupts instead of the 16 Ints a "normal" i386
compatible System has. 
Theese interrups arn´t in my /proc/interrupts. 
In the "Kernelsetup menuconfig"--> "Processor type an Features" I
disabled all Options and took "(PPro/6x86MX)" (Ok, I know, this was a
fault but it´s running very well on my machine).
Is it a bug or a feature? Ok, i think it´s very nice to have 24
Interrupts (no more problems with Multimedia hardware :-) but i know
that no PC Hardware is able to be set to INT >15.
Can I use them or is it just a hoax to make beginners asking questions
to the linux-kernel :-) ?
... confused

P.S.
For those who never saw that: a screenshot can be found on
