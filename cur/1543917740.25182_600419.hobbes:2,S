Good Morning - 
This morning I built the 2.6.23-rc8-git4 version of the kernel.  After
rebooting I was unable to keep my mail client (evolution) up and running
for more than a few minutes at a time.
A look in the log shows the following message when evolution aborts:
 kernel: [ 1716.971128] evolution[10212]: segfault at 00000054 eip
b74bbf63 esp bfc84b20 error 4
 kernel: [ 1835.797215] evolution[10335]: segfault at 00000056 eip
b745ef63 esp bfd9db20 error 4
 kernel: [ 1854.752324] evolution[10565]: segfault at 0000045f eip
b747ef63 esp bfa9c140 error 4
After falling back to 2.6.23-rc8-git3 I am no longer seeing this failure
(at least not yet)
My system is built on an AMD 64 X2 4600+ with 2 gig of memory, two SATA
and three PATA drives.  I am running what is basically a UBUNTU 7.04
system.
I am a certified dummy when it comes to diagnosing kernel issues so if
there is some additional information which would be useful let me know,
I would be happy to provide it.  Just be sure to send instructions on
how to gather it.
Thanks
Chris
