I think that's what happens.  cursor_on is set to 0 at the beginning of
fbcon_cursor(), and it remains 0 until the next fbcon_cursor() is
CM_DRAW or CM_MOVE.  And while cursor_on is 0, fbcon_vbl_handler just
exits immediately.  Yes, it's basically the code in 2.4, but instead of
using revc, it uses imageblit, and instead of allowing the drivers to do
the blinking, fbcon does it entirely, whether a hardware or software
cursor method is installed.

I don't think any cursor painting is done while doing putcs, if the
CM_ERASE, putc/putcs, CM_DRAW/CM_MOVE sequence is followed.  Note that I
haven't verified if that particular sequence is followed, I just assume
the console layer does.
