Do you mean the /devices tree or the Open Firmware (OF) device-tree
(as in IEEE Std 1275).  I suspect that you mean the former, but...

That looks similar, but not identical to an Open Firmware node for a
SCSI device:
  device-tree/pci@3fff5e09000/pci@b,6/scsi@1,1/sd/...
Why not use the structure of, and a subset of the capabilities of, an
OF device-tree for building /devices?  It's a little more verbose, but
it's a standard and it fits the current problem pretty well.
I've been working on some hardware inventory stuff at IBM that uses an
augmented OF device-tree (as a directory tree in userspace) to keep
track of useful stuff...
peace & happiness,
martin
