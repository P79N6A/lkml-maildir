Grega,
Things are a little funny.  You have CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT not set
but the compile errors you're getting are for code in acct.c that
will only compile if CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT is SET.  I suspect that
something is not right with your view.
1. Patch to acct.c didn't work correctly (did you get 2.5.7 by patching
   or a clean tar?).
2. need to do a make mrproper/config/dep/clean/etc...
Could you double check things and let me know.
