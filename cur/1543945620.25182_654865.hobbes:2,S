Hi,
The patch titled pci-disable-decoding-during-sizing-of-bars.patch in -mm 
was previously used as a candidate to fix a boot hang with Intel's Q35 
chipset: 
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198810
However, that particular issue is solved by commit a0ca9909609 in Linus 
tree:
	PCI x86: always use conf1 to access config space below 256 bytes
So unless there are other reasons for keeping 
pci-disable-decoding-during-sizing-of-bars around, I think we can drop it.
Thanks,
Daniel
