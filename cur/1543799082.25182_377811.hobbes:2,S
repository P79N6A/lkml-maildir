Given the existence of `cp -al', I'm not quite sure what the point of
out-of-tree building *is*. (I'm equally mystified by srcdir!=objdir
builds; I can see their utility for software with many generated files
and multi-stage bootstraps, like GCC, 'cos they simplify the makefiles,
but for normal software? What's the point?)
I mean, instead of
cd linux-2.6.blah
make blah O=/some/directory
you can always do
cp -al linux-2.6.blah /some/directory/
cd /some/directory
make blah
unless you're so short of space that you can't store the object files
and the source files on the same disk, and that should be a *very* rare
complaint with today's disk sizes.
