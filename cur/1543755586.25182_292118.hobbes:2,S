Ah, OK. 
Is there a driver for normal BTE operation or is not kernel-controlled ?

Nice! What kind of DMA chip was that and through which kind of bus was it connected
to CPU ?
I wonder what has to be done to have active DMA engines be abused for zeroing
when idle and what are the implications of that. Some kind of notification mechanism 
is necessary to inform idleness ? 
Someone should try implementing the zeroing driver for a fast x86 PCI device. :)
