Hi guys.
I'm interested to see if anyone else saw this behaviour in -test2-ac2, and
if it's been fixed since.
I'm seeing occasional filesystem corruption on a 20G IDE disk with a ext2
partition; short (of the order of 8-10 character) sections of files get
replaced with random characters. For instance:
  local uintWL test_radiø~H(Àø~H(Àoid);
This was from clisp, immediately after being unpacked from a tar file. If
the mail system mangles the above, it looks like:
  local uintWL test_radiA~H(BA~H(Boid);
where A is the lower case o with a slash, and B is the upper case A with a
grave accent. Modifying the file and saving it back appears to work fine.
Any ideas?
