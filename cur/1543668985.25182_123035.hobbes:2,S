Hm, that's the point. I don't know if ioctls are needed, because I'm not the
user of this "network COM-port", but only the possible developer. :)
I'll ask the person, who requested this feature tomorrow.
I think ioctls might be needed for his application. But the simple
nc-script doesn't provide them.
One thing is clear: For server-side there is no need for kernel-support.
But for the client kernel-support might be the best solution.
