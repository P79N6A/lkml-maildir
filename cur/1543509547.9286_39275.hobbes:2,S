If it is possible for events to happen faster than you can process
them at any point then the queue length will grow. How do you size
the queue to ensure that there is sufficient space to handle your
largest burst? Can you keep up at all? How many signals could you
get queued per fd? Like most absolute limits choosing a "right"
value is non-trivial.
