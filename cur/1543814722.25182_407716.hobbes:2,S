Three minor nits:
There are tabs replaced by spaces and superfluous line breaks inserted
in your posting. Take care that the mailer does not mangle whitespace.
If you cannot prevent this nor switch the mailer, send the patch as
attachment without recoding (i.e. 7bit encoding, not base64 or the
like).
Take care of a maximum line length of 80 characters. For example:
		/* Try to reactivate the "cycle master" bit. */
		reg_write(ohci, OHCI1394_LinkControlSet,
			  OHCI1394_LinkControl_CycleMaster);
The comment is unnecessary since the actual code is clear enough, at
least IMO.
Anyway, thanks again for identifying this problem.
