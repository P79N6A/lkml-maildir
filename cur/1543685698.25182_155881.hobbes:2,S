That is irrelevant.  The GCC manual says you can't use a pointer as
the argument to __builtin_expect anyway:
     Since you are limited to integral expressions for EXP, you should
     use constructions such as
          if (__builtin_expect (ptr != NULL, 1))
            error ();
     when testing pointer or floating-point values
