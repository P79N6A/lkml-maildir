Jens,
I ran into something similar today. I'd like to use cdrecord to write to a CD
and then immediately turn around and read from it for verification purposes...
...Except that I only get 2048 bytes from a 'cat /dev/scd0' until I take the CD
out and put it back in.
Is there a known way for a userland application to make an ioctl to the cdrom
device in a 2.4/2.6 kernel to tell it the media changed without forcing a tray
open & close?
I intend to execute a program with this ioctl (if there is such a thing) after
the cdrecord and before the 'cat'.
Thanks,
 -Byron
