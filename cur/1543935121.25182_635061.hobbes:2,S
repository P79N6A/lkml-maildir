Why do we need 10000 interfaces?  Why isn't network device creation a
slow path?
The problem seems to be in the data structures used by sysctl.
You are increasing the length of the linked list each time you
add a network interface.  So sysctl lookups slow down.
At 10000 entries that is a long linked list walk.
At 100000 things get even longer.  Now the numbers you report still
seem like a lot of time to me.  My guess would be that we are getting
badly into cache miss territory.
If what you describe is a real scenario where users care we need
to fix the sysctl data structures so that they scale.
Because of this bug report and another one I got earlier today
about a real bug in the parallel port code detected by the very
lookup that is slowing you down.  I am quite reluctant to contemplate
pulling this code.  It seems to be doing it's job, if in some cases
uncomfortably so.
So is this a bug report telling me that there are users with
10k or 100k interfaces that care.  So we need to fix sysctl.
Is there a specific kernel test case that is run often that having
slow sysctl performance matters for?  CONFIG_SYSCTL=n should solve
that if it is specialized.
