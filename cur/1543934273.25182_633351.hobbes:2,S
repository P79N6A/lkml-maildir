Hmm,,,
It might be possible as load_policy() doing, if necessary.
Please forget the previous my opinion.

When we use libcap built on older kernel for newer kernel, libcap cannot
handle newly added capabilities, because it is not exist on the build environment.
Therefore, any available capabilities should be exported dynamically by the kernel.

OK, it will be moved.

OK,

We can implement this feature on another pseudo filesystems.
Do you think what filesystem is the best candidate?
I prefer procfs or sysfs instead.
