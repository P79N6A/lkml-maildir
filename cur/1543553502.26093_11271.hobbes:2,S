Yeah, it does, doesn't it.  If this particular patch cured a
kernel-side lockup I would be very surprised.  Because the only effect
this patch is *supposed* to have is the visibility of certain kernel
header code when compiling userspace programs.
HPA, for what it's worth, which isn't much, I think your patch is
spot-on..
