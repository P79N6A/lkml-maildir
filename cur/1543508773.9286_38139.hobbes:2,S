I agree that this would be a sensible way of organizing the driver
tree.
I'd still want to not drop pcnet_cs in there by itself, but instead do
all the PCMCIA clients at once, after I've had time to sort out the
in-kernel-tree versus standalone PCMCIA issues.  I'd rather not create
too much unnecessary work for myself.
