No, mmap+write does not do the job. SMB file servers have
a remote copy operation. There shouldn't be any need to
pull data over the network only to push it back again!
The user-space copy operation is also highly likely to
lose stuff that the kernel would know about:
extended attributes   (IRIX, OS/2, NT)
forks / extra streams   (MacOS, NT)
creation time stamp   (Microsoft: not ctime or mtime)
author   (GNU HURD: person who created the file)
file type   (MacOS)
creator app   (MacOS)
unique ID   (Win2K)
mandatory access control data   (Trusted Foo)
non-UNIX permission bits   (every other OS)
ACLs   (NFSv4, NT, Solaris...)
translator   (HURD)
trustees   (NetWare)
