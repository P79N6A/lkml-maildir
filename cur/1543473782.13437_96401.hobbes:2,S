Subject: 2.2.0-pre1 doesn't compile properly for a 386

If compiled and loaded on a 386 the following message occurs with
2.2.0-pre1
This kernel doesn't support CPU's with broken WP. Recompile it for a
386!
It seems that CONFIG_WP_WORKS_OK is set for a 386 when it shouldn't
be
The following patch seems to do whatever the original author intended
and seems fix it, but it may break menuconfig or xconfig
