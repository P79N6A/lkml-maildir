I've never dabbled with creating my own CDs, but another sys admin here has
recently upgraded his m/c from alpha_osf1 to ix86_linux and is having problems
with CD writing. Can anyone make any suggestions as to what may be the problem?
RedHat 6.1, 2.2.12-20smp with TOSHIBA DVD-ROM SD-M1212 and HP CD-Writer+ 9200.
============================================================================
I am seeing some strangeness in the iso9660 filesystem.
The nature of the problem seems to be:
a) reading a directory giving a different list of files on different 
occasions
b) files being present when their name is uttered explicitly but 
absent from a directory listing or shell wildcard expansion.
Before I investigate in more detail, could you see whether there are 
any known problems in this area?
An example is:
/cds/0/win32/sysman/qtour/f> ls -l con1t04.htm
-r-xr-xr-x   1 root     system        572 Jun  5  1998 con1t04.htm
/cds/0/win32/sysman/qtour/f> echo con1t04.h*
con1t04.h*
/cds/0/win32/sysman/qtour/f>
But exactly the same thing done later gave:
/cds/0/win32/sysman/qtour/f> ls -l con1t04.htm
-r-xr-xr-x   1 root     system        572 Jun  5  1998 con1t04.htm
/cds/0/win32/sysman/qtour/f> ls -l con1t04.*  
-r-xr-xr-x   1 root     system        572 Jun  5  1998 con1t04.htm
/cds/0/win32/sysman/qtour/f> 
[ Background:
  /cds/1 is supposed to be a copy of /cds/0 with one added 
directory at the top level.  But 'diff -r' appears to show files missing
from the copy, which is plausible, but also many files in the copy which
are not in the original, which is not! ]
