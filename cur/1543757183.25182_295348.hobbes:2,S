Hi,
[ ... Hoping this message will get past the vger filters and will
  not continue the BK flamewar ... ]
[ ... in fact it did not pass the taboo filters, I modified the
  $subject to pass. I feel it would be better if the list admins
  publicly announced when a subject is being tabooed instead of
  silenty doing it. Think at those reading the archives later... ]
I've updated my Subversion kernel howto and did some work on the
import scripts:
	
http://www.popies.net/svn-kernel/
There are now two possibilities to convert the bkcvs repository
into a SVN one:
	* either using the original Ben Collins script, which will
	  map one Linus' changeset into a SVN revision (but all the
	  changesets which occured on another branch and got merged
	  by Linus will be packed into one single SVN revision)
	* or using my modified script which analyses the file deltas
	  and tries to recreate the original changesets (based on the
	  assumption that the log messages for every file involved
	  in a changeset is identical). It works pretty well, if a
	  file hasn't been modified several times on a branch.
The repository creation instructions have also changed a bit, 
improving the time necessary to do the conversion (on my AMD 2000+
I can create the full 2.6 repository in 2 hours using the first
script, 5 hours using the second script).
Feedback welcomed.
Stelian.
