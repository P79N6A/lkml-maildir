I just tried 2.5.51, but I still have the same problem, scratch pad works, but 
internal wart mouse doesn't.
Here is the current dmesg output:
	device class 'input': registering
	register interface 'mouse' with class 'input'
	mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
	register interface 'joystick' with class 'input'
	register interface 'event' with class 'input'
	input: PS/2 Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio1
	serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
	input: AT Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
	serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
Thank you,
