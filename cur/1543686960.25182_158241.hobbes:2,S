Ok, Thanks for the reply. As I don't want to suggest removing the driver 
from 2.6 at this point, I'll do the split-up when finding some time. As 
said, for 2.4 however this is not an option.
Given the time already wasted getting this into 2.5/2.6 this additional 
work forces me to consider 2.4 "don't care" for now - no problem. 
Jean, please tell me if you'd like some 2.4-backport to be put on your 
page so people can pull there.
Martin
