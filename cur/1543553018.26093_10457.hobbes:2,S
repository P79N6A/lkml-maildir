Let me see if I have all this straight:
(1) Change Rules.make to use "new style" variables as its native form.
    (1A) Add a "Compat.make" for old style Makefiles, and
    (1B) Continue to convert all the remaining old style Makefiles.
(2) Go with the "export-objs" style of declaring source files that need
    to be run through genksyms.  Files never get built just because they
    are in $(export-objs); $(export-objs) just determines who gets
    processed by genksyms at compile time.
(3) No LINK_FIRST / LINK_LAST.  Whatever is in the Makefile gets linked
    in that order.  We won't use $(sort ...) to eliminate duplicates
    (we will continue to handle them another way).
(4) When a multi is built into the resident kernel, the whole multi goes in,
    with no splitting into component parts.
Is that your plan, Linus?
I disagree with (3) because I think that initialization order requirements
should be spelled out and documented.  But I accept it.
Historical note on (4): as Keith said, I had to split up the multi's in
order to get the components into the OX_OBJS list.  But with a more
thorough implementation of (2), this becomes unnecessary.
