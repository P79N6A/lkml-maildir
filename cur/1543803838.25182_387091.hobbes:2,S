At least OpenVZ and vserver want very similar functionality.  They're
both working with out-of-tree patch sets.  We each want to do subtly
different things with tsk->pid, and task_pid() seemed to be a decent
place to start.  OpenVZ has a very similar concept in its pid_task()
function.
Arjan had a very good point last time we posted these: we should
consider getting rid of as many places in the kernel where pids are used
to uniquely identify tasks, and just stick with task_struct pointers.

We would very much like to run unmodified applications and libraries.
Doing it in a patched libc is certainly a possibility, but it wouldn't
make any future customers very happy.
I also wonder if RedHat or SUSE would ever ship and support a special
set of libraries for us.  Oh, and there are always statically linked
apps... :)
