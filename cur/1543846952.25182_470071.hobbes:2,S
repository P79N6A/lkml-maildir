Thank you very much for the inputs.
As per the discussion I have made the changes to the patch.
This change needs to be implemented in some of the partition checkers 
which doesn't do that already.
Btw, do you think it is a good idea to let the other partition checkers 
run, even if one of them has failed ?
Right now, the check_partition runs the partition checkers in a 
sequential manner, until it finds a success or an error.
Comments ?
Thanks,
Suzuki
