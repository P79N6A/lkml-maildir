This code performs quite a lot of potentially unaligned acceses.
Is there anything which guarantees that all these accesses are
well-aligned?
If not, will there be issues with platforms which don't handle
unaligned accesses as well as x86?
Should this code be using the unaligned access interfaces
(get_unaligned, put_unaligned, etc.  Might be wrong.  Keeps changing. 
Harvey Harrison is the guy to ask)?
