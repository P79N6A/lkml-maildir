Actually, this *is* bad. I bet someone is going to post their secret
key to lkml when debugging...
Or I can see conversation like this:
admin: "My devices work too slowly, is there something wrong with
device mapper?"
Pavel walks to his console, says: "Okay, show me your
/dev/mapper/volume1"
admin does that.
For this to be usefull Pavel'd have to remember the key before admin
realizes what he has done, but..... Or imagine pavel shoulder-surfing
admin trying to debug device mapper.
