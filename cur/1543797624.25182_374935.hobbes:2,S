Not at all - *much* more respect for IP rights then ever before.
The problem is the raised awareness yields problems for old economy
corporations which rely on segmented markets with a relatively small
number of competitors (so that you can actually handle all the patent
and license issue[0]) and the rest are private folks which can't afford
going to court after $CORPORATION took some piece of "work" (i.e.
usually software) and sells it as part of a e.g. WLAN access point
without paying for it a cent.

[0]: And we all know the licenses and patent "fees" are not more than an
     insurance for not getting sued by the issuer of the license.
