I'm going to try and do some clean up work on the iostat CPU results - 
the reason %user & %system are so low is (I think) because they also 
include a lot of 0% results from the tail of the runs (as the unmount is 
going on I think). I'm going to try and extract results for just the 
"meat" of the runs.
