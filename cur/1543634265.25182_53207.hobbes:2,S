	You should limit how many times you spin in this loop. If it gets to be too 
many, you should block.
	You can either block by sleeping for a few milliseconds. If you don't like 
the idea that one thread will release the lock and the other will waste time 
sleeping, then associate a kernel lock with the spinlock when a thread gives 
up waiting, have your unlock function check for an associated kernel lock and 
if there is one, unlock it.
