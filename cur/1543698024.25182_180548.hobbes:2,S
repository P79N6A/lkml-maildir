Yep it is OT.

It should try scaling first (and it works for me (tm)), but when
temperature reaches "critical" limit it is assumed that everything
failed and shutdown is only option. (On hp omnibook even in slowest
possible mode, if you play .mpg video it overheats.)

cpufreq is not connected to acpi thermal subsystem. Dominik has some
patches to change that, IIRC.
