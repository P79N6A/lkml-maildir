I'm not familiar with that aspect of Windows, but... sure.  :)

The kernel already does disk access to load a process... to load the 
executable.  The cache of priorities would be structured well on disk, 
and the data in that cache would be cached in RAM like any other file 
data is cached by the VM.
The kernel needs a process context to access files, so either there 
would be an artificial one which always exists for this, or the priority 
cache would be accessed in the context of the process being launched. 
It would be preferable to open the cache file once at boot time, so the 
former is probably best.

I appreciate the problems, and the cost may be greater than the benefit. 
  But if the cache is just a file in the file system, then there are no 
file-system dependencies.

Proc isn't a place.  It's a pseudo filesystem which requests information 
from kernel services.  The output you see from "cat /proc/..." is 
generated at the time you do the cat, which means it may not take ANY 
memory, because it's information that the kernel service already has to 
maintain anyway.  At least, I THINK it works this way.  :)
But in this case, it IS extra memory.  Would there be a process-launch 
penalty?  Definately.  But it might be worth it for the user experience. 
  Furthermore, the priority setting could be asynchronous, where the 
initial priority is a guess, and isn't set until the priority info has 
been fetched.
The thing is, if a program hasn't been loaded yet, then it has to be 
fetched from disk, and one more fetch won't hurt.  Launching processes 
involves LOTS of files being opened (shares libs, etc.).  Furthermore, 
if the program has ALREADY been run once, the both the program AND its 
priority descriptor are probably already in the VM disk cache.
Lastly, the WRITING to the disk of priorities is done in a lazy manner. 
  They could be fed via device node or /proc file to a daemon process 
that consolidates it.  Periodically, it would dump to disk.  So, 
launching and killing xterm 1000 times in one second would only result 
in a single update if the daemon flushed once per second.  Also, the 
'flush', would mostly involve writing to memory cache, letting the file 
system decide when it actually hits the platter.
