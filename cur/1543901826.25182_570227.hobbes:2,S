It means a major rewrite of the plugsched interface and I'm not sure
that it's worth it (if CFS works well).  However, note that I did say
probably not definitely :-).  I'll play with it and see what happens.

I don't think that is necessarily the case.

I don't think that this necessarily true.  Ingosched and ingo_ll are
definitely out and I don't feel like converting staircase and nicksched
as I have no real interest in them.  Perhaps I'll just create the
interface and some schedulers based on my own ideas and let others such
as Con and Nick add schedulers if they're still that way inclined.

Thanks for the offer of support (it may sway my decision),
