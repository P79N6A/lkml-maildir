   You were the one who asked for that patch.
I asked for the patch to be cleaned up to eliminate
the net/ipv4/*.c hacking. :)
   This brings me to another question: I've been told it is the
   general concensus  that this bridge firewall should be compiled in
   the kernel if CONFIG_NETFILTER=y.
I don't have any strong opinion here.
