I should have merged with 2.5.69 before mailing my fget-speedup patch out. 
->file_lock has been changed to a spin_lock somewhere after 2.5.66. 
That brings me to the point - with the fget-speedup patch, we should
probably change ->file_lock back to an rwlock again. We now take this
lock only when fd table is shared and under such situation the rwlock
should help. Andrew, it that ok ?
Thanks
