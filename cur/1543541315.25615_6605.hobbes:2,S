	Reverse this, PCs use 2048 byte, Suns and SGI units 512.  Any
post 1990 SGI will issue a SCSI command to reset to 512 if the drive
defaults to 2048, so they will boot without setting the 512byte block
mode jumper.  The Suns however require the jumper set to boot, though
they will read from a drive defaulting to 2048 byte block (just not
boot).
