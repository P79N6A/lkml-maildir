Nope. Quite the reverse, in fact. Having the "state" setting above the
wait-queue is usually a good idea, since it means that there are less
races to worry about.

No.
Kernel preemption is special, and it will preempt the process WITHOUT
CHANGING the state of it. See the PREEMPT_ACTIVE test in schedule(). The
process will still be left on the run-queue, and it will be run again,
even if it is marked sleeping.
