Considering this issue, and that everything else I've tried this far, I
beginning to think that the controller is, indeed, guilty as charged.

I see hangs in both X11 and console, but under console I use the
framebuffer device (rivafb).
This is the section about my hardware inside /etc/X11/XF86Config-4:
# **********************************************************************
# Graphics device section
# **********************************************************************
# Device configured by xf86config:
Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Creative VideoBlaster"
    Driver      "nv"
    VideoRam    16384
EndSection

Just to be certain, I have an old PCI graphic card (a Matrox Mystique)
that worked nicely since three years now... If that works nice, this
should be the final proof...

Yes.
Bye,
 Emmanuele.
