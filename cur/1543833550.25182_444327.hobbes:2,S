It contains too much implementation detail. Will likely outdate quickly.
Better shorten at least by 50% 
Also I'm not sure it is that useful to describe the hardware architecture
here (like ISTs). That is well documented in the Intel/AMD manuals
and a serious kernel programmer should read these anyways. Just add
a one line reference.

It is the other way round - x86-64 was first, i386 copied the scheme.

Among all the irrelevant detail you left out the crucial points: 
The hardware interrupt frame is still written on the original stack.
x86-64 redzones (allows compiler access stack pointer) have to be 
disabled by a compiler option because of that. And ISTs are not used for 
normal interrupt stacks because they don't nest.

Stackfault happens for more cases than just stack segment limit checking.

Revisiting that is on my todo list.  I still maintain it's more a kprobes
bug than a real feature though.
