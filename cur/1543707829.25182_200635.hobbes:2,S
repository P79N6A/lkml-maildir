You missed out an important piece of info.  The kernel should have printed
out "kmem_cache_create: duplicate cache <name>" before going BUG.
What was "<name>"?  uhci_urb_priv?
I suggest you go into drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c:uhci_hcd_cleanup() and
replace
	warn("not all urb_priv's were freed!");
with
	BUG();
because failure to destroy that slab cache is fatal, and it points at a bug
in this driver.
