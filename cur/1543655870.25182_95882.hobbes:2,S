I'm not sure this helps or is irrelevant (or already known), but I did try a
similar thing on a 2.5.50 kernel with the high-res-timers patches (all 4),
and it worked.  That same test did fail (as described above) in 2.5.51 (no
patches).
I have a feeling I may be missing something as I think (?) similar things
were discussed in the "[PATCH] compatibility syscall layer (lets try again)"
thread, but I know I didn't keep up.  I also may have misinterpreted the
original report.
In my test case, I set up a nanosleep to sleep for 5 seconds while I
interrupted it after 1 second with SIGSTOP and then SIGCONT.
On 2.5.50 w/HRT, it output:
  nanosleep() returned success [i.e., exitted w/no errors]
  Start 1039720777 sec; End 1039720782 sec
  Test PASSED
On 2.5.51 w/no HRT, it output:
  nanosleep() did not return success [i.e., exitted w/-1 and set errno]
  Start 1039721052 sec; End 1039721053 sec
  nanosleep() did not sleep long enough
From strace of the 2.5.51 run:
nanosleep({1, 0}, {1, 0})               = 0
kill(1233, SIGSTOP)                     = 0
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
kill(1233, SIGCONTnanosleep() did not return success
)                     = 0
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
wait4(-1, [WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 1], 0, NULL) = 1233
gettimeofday({1039721104, 153936}, NULL) = 0
The test case was a variant of nanosleep/3-2.c on posixtest.sf.net.
