1) In the press was published that 2.6.29 would include the rt2860 WIFI driver.  However, in 2.6.29-rc2 one find nowhere this driver. rt2x00 don't work, at least ifconfig ra0 up gives a error message.  and to compile it from source code, works with 2.6.26.X but not with 2.6.29-rc2 (plenty error messages) What's the situation of the rt2860 driver ??  The only senseful criterion for inclusion of a driver in the kernel is not the maturity of the code, but the number of sellings of that hardware in the shops, and that driver is necessary for msi wind notebooks, so it should be included into the kernel.
2) With 2.6.29-rc2 (and msi wind), compiz starts but quickly crashs. In 2.6.26.X it was stable. That should be verified / corrected (regression)
3)  eth cards don't work more since 2.6.27 .  ifconfig eth0  successful, but no connection.     I suppose that's a problem of the kernel config (because on other compilations/configurations it works) -- perhaps of the iptables, package treatment, or routing, not of the eth drivers themselves. However, although searching long time, I don't find out the reason.  This should be checked, and removed from the kernel config such options which potentially turn networking not longer working.
