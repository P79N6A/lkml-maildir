Well, kfree inlined was already mentioned but forgotten again.
What if this was used:
inline static void kfree_WRAP(void *addr) {
    if(likely(addr != NULL)) {
        kfree_real(addr);
    }
    return;
}
And remove the NULL-test in kfree_real()? Then we would have:
  test eax, eax
  jz afterwards;
  <some more stuff for call>
  call kfree_real;
.afterwards:
  <continue execution>
The two cases then:
ptr==NULL: test-jmp
ptr!=NULL: test-call(freeit-return)
Looks like the least expensive way to me.
