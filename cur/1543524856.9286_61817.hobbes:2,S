No, it only requires stdin/stdout to display output/accept input.

Both of the SCSI controllers I am using are from Diamond and use
ncr53c875 chips.  I have never had trouble with either of them in 
the past.

I am re-testing the situation.  I have rebooted the system and am
now playing a copy of Jean-Luc Ponty's "A Taste For Passion" from
CD while doing a dump backup/verify to tape.  No errors so far.  The
CD I was playing before was "Abba Gold Greatest Hits" when I received 
the SCSI errors.  Maybe my system does not like Abba for some reason.
