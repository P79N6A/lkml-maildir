For various reasons I haven't been able to rerun my tests with a
2.3.18/19 kernel on a 4xCPU system; but on a 2xCPU system, tests suggest
on the order of a 10% (YMMV) decrease in spinlock "wait time" cycles
between 2.3.16 and 2.3.18.  That number may be wildly inaccurate, but at
least it's hinting that we're headed in the right direction.
