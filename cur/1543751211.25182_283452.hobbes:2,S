hello anyone
i thing that i didn't get the point... what did suppose to mean "we can 
come up with our own open wireless hardware". does it means that the 
kernel/ Linux community to design a complete hardware from scratch?
I'm don't know if there is people that would like to work in a project 
like that. if there is people that would like to do it i don't know if 
they can do it...
in case that i would had the choice then i get my wireless card, to make 
a new my one based to the design of someone that i don't know, not 
knowing if it is going to work in all cases and environments and knowing 
that i would use FPGA instead of ICs created for this functionality... i 
would not do it... i know what means designing hardware even if i don't 
have great experience in that (only some basic experience in Verilog...) 
i think that an idea like that is much closer to the opercores 
situation...(www.opencores.org)
According to my understanding, the problem with the wireless cards 
drivers and generally the drivers can be solved in two ways... first 
convincing the companies to produce the drivers or help other people 
code them.
OR
reverse engineering to the win drivers...(i think that this is harder)
i never understand way companies don't help with the drivers under 
linux.... in any way they are going to sell more products...
any way sorry for the long text and C.U. around.
