I total agree with you on the profits of modules, but what I mean is not
that it should not be allowed to keep them in the kernel tree, but that
the interface with the kernel is more structured and more flexible, in
such way that if someone (for example a commercial company) wants to
deliver a driver, he has a welldefined interface indeed, some kernel-structures change sometimes, but I think that at least
in the stable kernel branch, these changes are not frequent enough to
implicit that a different driver must be compiled for every kernel.
 
Of course most drivers can be kept in the kernel tree, sorry if I seemed
to state otherwise.
