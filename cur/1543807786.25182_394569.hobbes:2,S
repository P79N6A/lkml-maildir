Greetings to the sensors people;
There is a line output to the screen during the aftermath of 
initializing the sensors that I didn't think was making it to the logs, 
but I just found it:
---------
Feb  6 22:01:36 coyote kernel: Driver 'w83627hf' needs updating - please 
use bus_type methods
---------
I went back and looked around in the xconfig, but nothing jumps up and 
taps me on the knee there.
My sensors are working ok according to gkrellm.  Is this temporary and 
self-healing in future releases, or even something to worry about?  
Worse yet, will it break gkrellm eventually?

Cheers, Gene
People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
