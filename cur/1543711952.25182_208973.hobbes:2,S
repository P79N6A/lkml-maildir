I want something like this, so I am willing to spend some time

About recursive notification:
Some way to watch for changes on a whole file system is a must. 
Otherwise there is really no need to replace dnotify. When I start up 
KDE it watches for 256 different directories in my /home directory. It 
would probably watch even more directories if it could. With recursive 
watching it would only need to watch two or three directories recursively.
About the buffer memory usage problem:
I have been testing the current approach for a few days continuously 
now, and I don't get event buffer overflows even if I watch for all 
events on "/". Of course the event buffer size should be limited. The 
current implementation uses 10*4096 bytes, but in most cases starting 
with a single 4096 byte page should be enough.
Note that the most common events (read and write) are quite small. 
Currently they are 32 bytes, but it would not be that hard to get them 
even smaller if nessecary. This is quite good compared to libraries like 
dazuko that report the complete path for each change.
Extended information about the type of change has been requested by many 
persons, and it is nessecary for many applications. People have been 
writing ugly syscall table hacks for this, so they must be really 
desperate to get this information...
It should be optional though.

Agreed.

This would require large changes, and I think figuring out all aliases 
to a path might as well be done in userspace. You don't gain much by 
putting this in the kernel, and it requires a lot of complexity.

Should be no problem to add this with the current approach. But it is 
not that bad if you are getting hundreds of write events for a single 
file. They are just 32 bytes, so you can just throw them away in the 
userspace if you are not interested in them.
