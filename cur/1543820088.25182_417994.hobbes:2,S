The 'make headers_export' stage also works just as well as the above,
and it gives us something more concrete to work on, where we can _see_
the bits which are needlessly exported and start to clean them up.

The problem is that Linus is unlikely to accept a trivial cleanup patch
which, for example, removes the contents of linux/auxvec.h and creates
kabi/auxvec.h. He'll argue, as he did last year, that it's moving stuff
around for the sake of it.
On the other hand, he _would_ be likely to accept patches which split
existing files into two _within_ the include/linux directory. And that's
the important part of the task; it doesn't _matter_ where the files are
put, because we can deal with that in the 'export' stage, and we can
trivially move them around later anyway once we do have a consensus.
We're doing it this way because we want to get on with the real work
without getting bogged down in a discussion with Linus about the
pointless details. Unfortunately we're getting bogged down in a
discussion about the pointless details anyway.
If you can get the trivial patches to move stuff into kabi/ merged,
that's _FINE_. Go wild. If you can't, then it's still useful to do the
same cleanups but keep all the resulting files in the same directories.
The 'headers_export' make target is still useful in the meantime,
because it produces the set of headers which we expect people to put
into /usr/include, and which we can do sanity checks on.
