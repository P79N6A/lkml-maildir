I would note that in my experiment I got errors when first checked hash bucket
was empty. With this patch I have guarantee that at least one conntrack will be
checked. I'm agree 1 is not too high, but it is better than nothing. I've
checked, my testcase works now.

I need to count conntracks but not hash buckets. Also it is possible that all
the conntracks will be placed to only one hash bucket, and as you pointed in
your previous letter it may lead to long delays.
However how do you think, is it probably better to set low limit to default
average number of conntracks in hash bucket?
cnt = max(8U, nf_conntrack_max/nf_conntrack_htable_size);
Thank you,
