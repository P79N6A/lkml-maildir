I was impressed in the sense that it was a hell of a lot better than the 
disaster that were the earlier drafts.
I still think GPLv2 is simply the better license.
I consider dual-licensing unlikely (and technically quite hard), but at 
least _possible_ in theory. I have yet to see any actual *reasons* for 
licensing under the GPLv3, though. All I've heard are shrill voices about 
"tivoization" (which I expressly think is ok) and panicked worries about 
Novell-MS (which seems way overblown, and quite frankly, the argument 
seems to not so much be about the Novell deal, as about an excuse to push 
the GPLv3).
