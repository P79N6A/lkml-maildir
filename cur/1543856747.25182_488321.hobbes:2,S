Hi Linus,
  This patch set comprises the bulk of my 2.6.20 features which need to be
pushed upstream. My description of the changes is below:
* Various ocfs2 cleanups, including a patchset by me intended to clean up
  some of the internal ocfs2 journal api. Mostly this revolves around
  removing the ocfs2_journal_handle wrapper around handle_t. The immediate
  benefits are better readability and a slightly smaller memory footprint
  for open journal transactions.
* Configfs gets some small cleanups and some mutex annotations.
* Atime updates - thanks to Tiger Yang <tiger.yang@oracle.com>, ocfs2 now
  writes to the inode atime field. This doesn't require any disk changes,
  and is completely backwards compatible with older ocfs2 versions. An
  inodes Atime is only updated if it hasn't changed within a certain
  quantum. The user can define their own value at mount time, with 0
  indicating that atime should always be updated. This is very similar to
  the scheme implemented by gfs2.
* Sys_splice - ocfs2 now has splice read and write support. Thanks again to
  Tiger for the bulk of this functionality. Mostly we make use of the
  generic_splice_read() and generic_file_splice_write_nolock() functions
  provided already in fs/splice.c.
 - There is one patch in the ocfs2 splice() series external to fs/ocfs2 - a
   simple export of should_remove_suid(). This is done for code reuse
   purposes. That particular patch can be seen at:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mfasheh/ocfs2/ocfs2_git_patches/ocfs2-upstream-linus-20061201/0025-Export-should_remove_suid.txt
   I'll also attach it to this mail for review purposes.
* Not included in this set of patches are the following updates, which I
  think need a few more days before they're ready (I'll push them early next
  week if they make the cut):
  - A lock migration fix within the ocfs2 dlm.
  - Some patches to make ocfs2 network timeout values user-adjustable.
  - A "local mount" patch which will give ocfs2 the ability to act as a
    local file system (no cluster configuration needed, no dlm locking,
    etc).

Subject: [PATCH] Export should_remove_suid()
This helps us avoid replicating the same logic within file system drivers.
