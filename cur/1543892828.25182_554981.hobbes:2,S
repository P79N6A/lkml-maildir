==================== Changes in man-pages-2.54 ====================
New pages
---------
man-pages.7
    mtk
        A description of the conventions that should be followed
        when writing pages for the man-pages package.
Changes to individual pages
---------------------------
fcntl.2
    mtk
        Remove misleading text about setting O_ASYNC when calling
        open(); one must use fcntl() F_SETFL for this task.
fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Converted outdated BUGS note about fdatasync() being
        equivalent to fsync() on Linux 2.2 into a NOTES note
        about this historical behaviour.
mprotect.2
    mtk, after an observation by Emmanuel Mogenet
        A much improved example program.
    mtk
        Significant rewrites and additions to description.
