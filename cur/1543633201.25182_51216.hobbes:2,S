Subject: 2.5.21: kbuild changes broke filenames with commas
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

With the latest kbuild version in 2.5.21, we are unable to build the
following files:
linux/drivers/block/smart1,2.h
linux/drivers/scsi/53c7,8xx.c
linux/drivers/scsi/53c7,8xx.h
linux/drivers/scsi/53c7,8xx.scr
linux/arch/arm/mm/proc-arm6,7.S
linux/arch/arm/mm/proc-arm2,3.S
This is because we end up passing gcc the following argument:
	-Wp,-MD,.proc-arm6,7.o.d
which gets passed to cpp0 as:
	-MD .proc-arm6 7.o.d
	              ^ space, not comma
and therefore cpp0 sees "-MD", ".proc-arm6" and "7.o.d" as separate
arguments.
There seems to be two solutions:
1. renaming all the above files to contain '_' instead of ','.
2. see if kbuild can use the DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT environment variable
Kai pointed out that we've already got one exception in kbuild to fixup
the filename for KBUILD_BASENAME (, -> _ and that's not a weird smilie!)
so (1) is probably going to be better, and we can get rid of the special
"comma" handling.
Either way, I plan to rename the two ARM files.  That leaves the 53c7,8xx
driver and that block header file.
