There is one more use, in proving you own a computer if it is stolen.  A
simple program on a bootable floppy could be used to determine the serial
number of any computer's CPU.  If you already have your PIII numbers
registered somewhere, that's pretty compelling proof that this was once your
CPU.
Would it be ok for the kernel to check for a serial number enabled CPU,
put it up on the screen, optionally log it, then shut off the ID after that?
