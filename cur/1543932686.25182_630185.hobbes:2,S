OK, some fixes since last time, as I wade through more SCSI drivers.  Some 
drivers use "use_sg" as a flag to know whether the request_buffer is a 
scatterlist: I don't need the counter, but I still need the flag, so I fixed 
that in a more intuitive way (an explicit ->sg pointer in the cmd).
Also, I've updated and tested scsi_debug, after Douglas's excellent 
suggestion.
(I just found out about struct scsi_pointer, so I'm off to update that now, 
too).
Cheers,
Rusty.
