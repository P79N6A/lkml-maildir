I don't think it's absurd but you have deconstructed it succesfully
anyway.  Summary to watchers: you can turn any GPL-compatible software
into GPL software, so integration with GPL-compatible software is
permitted.
A bit like "this hold only permits square pegs".  Oh dear, I have a
round peg.  Ah, but I didn't appreciate, you can cut round pegs to make
them square at any time.

Now, I know and you know that integration as not the same as
aggregation.  But the below suggests that someone draws the line
differently.  Why not just say "derived work"?
