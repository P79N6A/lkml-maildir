I applied all these to the ppc64 kernel (you missed ppc64 btw) and it dies.
Quite late in boot, during floppy_init->init_disk_stats->alloc_percpu.
I'm reduced to debugging with printk on ppc64.  __alloc_percpu() calls
new_block(), loops around and then dies in here:
#define D() printk("at %s:%d\n", __FILE__, __LINE__)
			D();
			/* Transfer extra to previous block. */
			if (b->size[i-1] < 0)
				b->size[i-1] -= extra;
			else
				b->size[i-1] += extra;
			b->size[i] -= extra;
			ptr += extra;
			D();
Not sure what happened - no oops, no xmon, no sysrq, no nuthin.  It even
manages to lock up minicom on the other end of the cable.  Impressed.
