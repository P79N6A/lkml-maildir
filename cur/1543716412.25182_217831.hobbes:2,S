Indeed, I've just checked here, because I believed I had seen it working,
but now I think it was the softdog. It does nothing at all. I've downloaded
and read AMD's datasheet and the driver seems to do the right thing. BTW,
I wonder if the chip is buggy or not, because I tried to play with the
SYSRST and FULLRST bits in the 0xCF9 register. Changing SYSRST to 1 does not
change anything, and changing FULLRST to 1 immediately reboots the machine
even if no reset was pending !

Willy
