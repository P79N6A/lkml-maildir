FYI
For kicks I ran this on 2.6.11-rc2-RT-V0.7.36-02 (I still had it as a
Grub option), and the system just locked up hard.  I just was curious if
this was from a different change. But at least in the latest it shows
output, and not just a hard lockup.
Oh, the bug report was running kernel 2.6.12-rc1-RT-V0.7.43-06.
