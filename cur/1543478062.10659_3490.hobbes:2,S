If true, it is *highly* imperative she distributes the sources far and
wide such that it would be impossible for the Evil Powers-That-Be to
censor it, to gag her or even worse, have her murdered in the name of
National Security. It can happen and has actually happened in the past
(cf. German hacker found dead before Christmas - he had been working on
encryption) 
Cheers,
