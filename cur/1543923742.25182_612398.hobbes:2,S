Good point.

Do you think adding a panic_nodump() call would be fine for those few
locations that is obviously a user/machine bug. This way we could make a
wrapper for panic. Change panic to have a dump parameter.
e.g.
  void __panic(int dump, const char * fmt, ...);
  #define panic(x...) __panic(1, x)
  #define panic_nodump(x...) __panic(0, x)
hmm, that will cause the print format to need to be changed, and if
someone screws up their formanting, the offset of parameters will be off.
Perhaps stripping most of the panic code into separate static functions,
and having two normal functions panic and panic_nodump might be better.
Thoughts?
