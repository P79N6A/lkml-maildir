Ok. Just as long as it works. :)
My two concerns are:
* Things that assume there's a name for every kobject.
* Things that assume that a kobject's name cannot change.
The documentation isn't clear about the semantics in these cases. But
you have more experience with kobjects than I do so perhaps these are
obvious to you.
Otherwise I'm just waiting to see this committed.
