That part of the scheme is good, but I'm still not convinced the lookup is
a big deal. To open a file, you still end up doing a lookup that matches
name to device (ie a dentry hash lookup). There's no reason opening a
device couldn't use a similarly fast (or even identical!) method without
requiring that the /dev dir be managed inside the kernel. In fact, I think
I earlier suggested it's possible to cache the lookup in the inode.
