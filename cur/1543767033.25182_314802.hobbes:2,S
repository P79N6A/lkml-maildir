But isn't that the stuff we use for swapping drives? Down the drive, down
the interface, swap, and restart? Are these the functions called by hdparm
(-bRU) which are all of a sudden not going to work? Or am I being

I'll have to read the release notes and see who to thank for this
reduction in functionality.
