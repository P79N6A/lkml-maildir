Partitions are never the right size when you fill one up.
I used to do what you describe, and got fed up when I had too many
strange symbolic links around, things like
	/var/www -> /disk2/www
	/var/log/httpd -> /disk2/httpd_logs
	/home/jamie -> /disk2/jamie
	/home/jamie/downloads -> /disk3/jamie_downloads
etc.
It seemed simpler to have one filesystem, and indeed it was.
(Now I have two drives at home I am back to the above, unfortunately.
At least the laptop is nice and simple, as it can only have 1 drive :)
Also, on a dedicated server I still use symbolic links between
partitions as it is too risky to try rearranging the partitions
remotely, and too expensive to rent more disk space.
