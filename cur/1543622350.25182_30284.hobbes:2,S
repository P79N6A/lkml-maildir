Yes... unlink() becomes `mv /path/filename /deleted/path/filename`
Simple.  For idiot users, you can just make such an alias for those
who insist in doing `rm *` instead of `rm \*` after they had used
a wild-card as a file-name... It happens:
	`ls *.* >files`
...is typoed to:
	`ls *.>* files`
If somebody then recreates the same file and deletes it again -- tough.
