Open drivers aren't magic.. if the vendor doesn't give us the
information how specific chips are screwed, there isn't anything we
can do about it, ATI don't support the open drivers for anything but
RN50s from Dell and their support is quite brutal even on those (every
patch is a dirty hack...), the thing is with the open drivers we can
say hey ATI that is a dirty hack, with the closed ones they just stick
it in and ship it..
