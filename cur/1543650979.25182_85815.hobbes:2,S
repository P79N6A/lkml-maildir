This also explains why Linus said it was a vendor push situation. If
vendors pick it up, find it useful (as I am sure they will), and tell
Linus about that usage... LKCD will become part of the mainline tree.
I suspect for most vendors, it would be part of their extra cost
"server" package and the Linux/390 package... It clearly has the
potential to enhance service and buyers of server packages need it.
If along the way, significant numbers of "big users" like Purdue adopt
it, use it, and reflect back to L-K the diagnostic successes and fixes
which result, that could speed the decision. If Linus has a tough bug,
installs LKCD, sends the dump to a wizzard and gets a fix, that would
definitely speed the decision.
