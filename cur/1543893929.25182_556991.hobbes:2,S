The GPLv2 says:
"For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code 
for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition 
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of 
the executable."
The question is whether this includes private keys.
Different people have different opinions regarding this issue.
If "the complete source code" includes private keys, the GPLv2 requires 
them to give any costumer the private keys.
Fact is that Harald Welte did in several cases successfully convince 
vendors that private keys are part of the source code if they are 
required for running the compiled binary on some hardware.
AFAIK there haven't been any court rulings on this issue, and it could 
even be that courts in different countries will decide differently.
