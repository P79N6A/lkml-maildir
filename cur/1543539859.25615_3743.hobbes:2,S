Not if it's compiled without APIC support (in 2.2.x it's coupled with SMP
support, in 2.4.x it's separate option AFAIK).

Correct. But I have THREE NIC's there. So I can access system if ANY of them
fails (even more: if one NIC is fryed backup will be activated automagically).

Perhaps. Usually if one NIC is fryed I can shedure replacement procedure for
month or so later - I have more then enough time for that.
P.S. NIC can be fried by static electricity, not only from cracker. That's
