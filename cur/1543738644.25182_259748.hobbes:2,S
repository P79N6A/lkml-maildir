Many, many people are seeing this problem (weird, often periodic latency
spikes on laptops that go away when ACPI is disabled).  This would
explain a lot of weird bug reports.  So are most laptops just
incompatible with low latency applications, or are we talking about a
small minority of broken hardware?
Is there any way to tell a priori whether a machine will have this
problem?
