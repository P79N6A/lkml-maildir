Well, that makes two of us for sure.

My /boot is an ext3 partition on an IDE disk.  My symptoms and your
symptoms match -- wait awhile, and it works okay.  If you don't wait
"long enough" the changes made in /etc/lilo.conf are not reflected in
the after running /sbin/lilo and rebooting normally.
I have been unable to reproduce this on a uniproc system with SCSI
disks.
2.5.67 seems to work in this regard as expected.

I don't know -- I haven't isolated it yet.
Anyone else?
