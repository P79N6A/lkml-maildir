Have you actually seen this with a recent kernel in the wild or are
you just talking theoretically?
Linux uses some heuristics to manage the syn queue that should
still ensure reasonable service even without cookies under attack.
Also SYN-RECV sockets are stored in a special data structure optimized
to use minimal resources.
It is far from the classical head drop method that was so vunerable
to syn flooding.
