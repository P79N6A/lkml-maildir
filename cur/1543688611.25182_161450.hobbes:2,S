'man nameif'
Works great, less filling - my Dell 840 has up to *4* ethernets (the onboard
built-in, the dock, the built-in wireless, and a Xircom card that's a combo
56k modem/100BaseT).
My /etc/mactab looks like this:
# Onboard 10/100 port
eth0 00:06:5b:b9:5e:27
# 10/100 port on Xircom 10/100/56K card
eth2 00:10:a4:9c:a8:86
# wireless card
wvlan0 00:02:2d:5c:11:48
eth1 00:02:2d:5c:11:48
# 10/100 port on dock...
eth3 00:06:5b:ea:8e:4e
(yes, there's 2 entries for the wireless - 2.4 kernel wants wvlanX, 2.6 calls it ethX.
The magic under a RedHat system happens in:
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup
Hope that helps.
