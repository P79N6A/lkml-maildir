Hi, 
I suffer from unreliable cdrom operations (failing DAE and burn sessions) 
with the openSUSE 2.6.18.8-0.7-bigsmp kernel.
Additionally, the syslog is continuesly spammed with:
Feb 12 00:03:22 kernel: hdc: cdrom_pc_intr: The drive appears confused (ireason = 0x01).
 Trying to recover by ending request.
Feb 12 00:57:52 kernel: hdc: cdrom_pc_intr: The drive appears confused (ireason = 0x01).
 Trying to recover by ending request.
Feb 12 01:36:21 kernel: hdc: cdrom_pc_intr: The drive appears confused (ireason = 0x01).
 Trying to recover by ending request.
Feb 12 01:38:49 kernel: hde: cdrom_pc_intr: The drive appears confused (ireason = 0x01).
 Trying to recover by ending request.
Feb 12 08:06:07 kernel: hde: cdrom_pc_intr: The drive appears confused (ireason = 0x01).
 Trying to recover by ending request.
I drove that devices on a pdc20268 based Promise Ultra TX/2 100 card for 
some time, which had some IDE/ATAPI issues documented. After exchanging 
that PCI card with a "Silicon Image PCI0680 based one, the problem persists.
Is there any firmware/atapi protocol problem known with these drives?
