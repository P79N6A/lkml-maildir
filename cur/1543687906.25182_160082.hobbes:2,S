Well, if you are using ACPI, then this is a know behaviour with -test4
releases. It's ACPI related. Please, take a look at the following bug
report:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1123
During boot, the kernel checks for i8042 AUX/MUX ports, tries
registering IRQ #12 and then hangs. I fixed the problem on my i845DE
motherboard by flashing a new BIOS with APIC and IOAPIC support. Then, I
recompiled 2.6.0-test4 with APIC and IOAPIC support and the hangs went
away.
If you can't use/compile APIC and IOAPIC for your motherboard, try
booting the kernel with "pci=noacpi" as a workaround. This will prevent
from using ACPI IRQ routing and use standard PCI IRQ routing. Also, if
you have the time, please, attach your "dmidecode" and "acpidmp" to the
bug report at the above URL.
Thanks!
