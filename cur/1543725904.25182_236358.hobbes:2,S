Well if you want to increase the maximum number by ten you do:
	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		up(&foo);
and similarly for decreasing the limit.  That will involve doing down()s,
which will automatically wait for the current number of threads to fall to
the desired level.
But I don't really see a need to tune this on the fly - probably the worse
problem occurs during bootup when the operator cannot perform tuning.
So a __setup parameter seems to be the best way of providing tunability. 
Initialise the semaphore in usermodehelper_init().
