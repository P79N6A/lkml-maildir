I'm seeing the message:
bad: scheduling while atomic!
I see this dozens of times when I'm writing to a nand flash device using a 
vendor-provided driver from Compulab in 2.6.8.1.  Does this mean the driver 
has a bug or is incompatible with the preemptive configuration option?  How 
bad is "bad"?  Should I turn of the preemption option, ignore the message, 
or what?
Thanks...
                      David
