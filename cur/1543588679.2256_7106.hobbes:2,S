You are right. As several people have pointed out to me it is in fact 
legal to have the trailing comma. And it _does_ make it easier to add 
new lines.
At least I have learned a lesson here; be 100% sure of your facts before 
posting to linux-kernel ;)

That function (sock_rcvlowat()) only gets called a few places, so I'll 
see if I can figure out exactely what's going on and come up with a 
better construct (it might take me ages, but I'm determined to learn to 
find my way around this code)...

Ok, I'll continue reading code and keep my eyes open for these things.
