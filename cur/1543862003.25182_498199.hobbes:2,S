I thought about it, wrote an email, then cancelled it as it won't work.
what I thought was that you could a limited unionfs case would be with X 
layers read-only and the top layer read-write, and what you would do is 
dynamically make read only bind mounts for the the X layers and since 
you control the top layer hide it from the system.
However, read only bind mounts are great if you want a limit a process 
to accessing the files read-only, as they won't have access to the other 
vfs_mounts, but it does nothing for the other vfs_mounts that are using 
that same file system.  hence, does us no good.
