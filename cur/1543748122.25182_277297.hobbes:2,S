Yes, it does that.
However, I agree with you.  I don't see a good reason for it.
Duplicate name can just return NULL.  NOTE:  Such a change most
likely requires an audit of all callers of kmem_cache_create()
to be sure that they check its return value.  There's a gcc
attribute that can be added to the function prototype to
warn if the function is called without looking at its
return value, although just doing
	x = kmem_cache_create(...);
and ignoring x probably evades the warning.
include/linux/compiler-gcc+.h:
#define __must_check 		__attribute__((warn_unused_result))
