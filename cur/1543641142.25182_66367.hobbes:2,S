While USB-storage error handling is looked at...

There's a check for US_BULK_TRANSFER_FAILED after
a call to usb_stor_transfer everywhere except here... Is it for 
a reason?
Backround:
A long time ago (linux-2.4.19-pre4-ac2) I got a USB disk
related hang (all processes accessing it stuck in state D).
It happened while reading from a USB-storage device
(disk attached to a USB-IDE bridge).
The system log has just these two errors:
usb-uhci.c: interrupt, status 3, frame# 1660
usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
That problem happened only once. I had to reboot in order
to continue use the device.
Is it possible that the missing check is the cause for that
hang?
