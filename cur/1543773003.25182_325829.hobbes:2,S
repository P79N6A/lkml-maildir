Great, thanks.

Uhm, no, I wasn't saying that.  Just suggesting a simple failsafe.  It's not important.

I wasn't suggesting that we include the entire source code as-is.  Just that if we can include the decompressor in < 45K of code, surely the compression could be included easily.  Again, it's not very important.  Giving enough information to build and run is most important.
