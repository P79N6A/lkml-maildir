here's the deal.... the killing of an interrupt handler because of an
oops THEN causes a panic. If you dump stack AGAIN, you have 2 stack
traces, with the first one being the real good one, and the second one
being.. well more crappy... so you proposal just dropped the good
stacktrace off the screen in favor of a worse one...
