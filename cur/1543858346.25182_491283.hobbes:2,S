with the patch it boots perfectly without any command-line args.
without the patch it crashes after the "4" and before the "5" in this 
hacked up segment of the code:
        if (!(fwh_dec_en1_val & FWH_F8_EN_MASK))
                pci_write_config_byte(dev,
                                      fwh_dec_en1_off,
                                      fwh_dec_en1_val | FWH_F8_EN_MASK);
        if (!(bios_cntl_val &
              (BIOS_CNTL_LOCK_ENABLE_MASK|BIOS_CNTL_WRITE_ENABLE_MASK)))
                pci_write_config_byte(dev,
                                      bios_cntl_off,
                                      bios_cntl_val | BIOS_CNTL_WRITE_ENABLE_MASK);
        printk(KERN_INFO "intel-rng: 4\n");
        writeb(INTEL_FWH_RESET_CMD, mem);
        printk(KERN_INFO "intel-rng: 5\n");
