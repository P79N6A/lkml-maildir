Then this is why you get the error

You get what you ask for, then:  timeouts

Leave it running for a million years, and I'm sure a sporadic error will
show up in those two situations as well.
You just now found a case where sporadic errors show up more often.
soft-mount = fail upon (sporadic) error
hard-mount = retry (forever or until interrupted if used with 'intr') upon error
I always use hard,intr so that I can manually interrupt hanging jobs,
but also know that they do not randomly fail just because a few packets
get dropped on my network.  This seems to be the common setup, as far as
I know.
Cheers,
