This is a sparse file generated by some kind of error. A sparse file
could show a length equal to the maximum size allowed for a file, but
use only one allocation unit. You could create such a file by creating
one, doing an lseek to some large offset, writing one byte, then closing
it.
I would just delete it. The error probably occurred over NFS with the
file-size being received incorrectly. You probably have nothing wrong
with your local file-system.
