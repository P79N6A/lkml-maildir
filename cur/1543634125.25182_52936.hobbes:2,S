I agree.
Maybe the patch I once made to support CPUs with different speeds can serve
as a starting point?

However, one would need to make sure that all CPUs occasionally do receive
timer interrupts, otherwise your TSC may overflow. Depending on your
hardware (APICs), this might be an issue. I've been told that Fosters do
misbehave ...
