Btw, things like this:
	+#define IDEFLOPPY_TICKS_DELAY  HZ/20   /* default delay for ZIP 100 (50ms) */
are just bugs waiting to happen.
Hint: see what happens when you do something like this:
	high_byte = IDEFLOPPY_TICKS_DELAY >> 8;
	low_byte = (unsigned char) IDEFLOPPY_TICKS_DELAY;
and watch in amazement how you get entirely the wrong value if HZ is 1000.
Try it out..
