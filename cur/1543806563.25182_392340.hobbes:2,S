Well, actually that's more or less what I had done before, and it
worked. I had a group of ioctl commands for configuring my device. The
command number was based on an unusded "magic number", as I was told
when reading Linux Device Drivers 3rd:
#define SCULL_IOCSQUANTUM _IOW(SCULL_IOC_MAGIC,  1, int)
#define SCULL_IOCSQSET        _IOW(SCULL_IOC_MAGIC,  2, int)
This actually works, but it doesnt seem to be "ellegant" code for new
drivers in 2.6. Or at least that's what it says in LDD3, since the
ioctls are system wide, unstructured, and so on.
That's why I was asking for a more ellegant and cleaner configuration
method. It seems that the new filesystem "configfs" is perfect for
that, but I would like to know if netlink sockets can also be used for
that purpose (as I'm writing a kind of network device).
Thank you anyway
