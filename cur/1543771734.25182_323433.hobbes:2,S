Unfortunately this approach is not feasible, since there is no 'reverse
mapping' from a file to a process.  So for every URB delivery, we would
have to walk that task_list and check which tasks have opened this file.
So what do we do now?
A reimplementation of async URB handling (probably use the AIO code)
from userspace is a significant amount of work.
Meanwhile, this bug allows any regular non-root userspace program with
access to a single USB device to oops the kernel, so a short-term fix is
definitely required for security reasons.
