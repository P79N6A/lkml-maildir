Hi,
I was wondering if anyone has gotten LVM2 support with the 2.4.32 kernel?
I downloaded device-mapper.1.01.05 and applied the 2.4.28-pre4-devmapper
and 2.4.22-VFS-lock patches to my 2.4.32 kernel, which seemed to be
successful
I then added module support for device mapper in the kernel, and did
make dep && make bzImage modules modules_install && make install
So then i reboot and I see "dm-mod.o: -1 Unresolved external symbol"
I had no errors or warnings building my modules
Any ideas how i can find out what the external symbol is, or does anyone
see anything I'm missing?
Thanks!
George
