Even without opening up the code, but with programming specs there are 
many graphics driver guys out there, given the specs out it would not be 
too hard to have a decent driver, without the Nvidia IP. In that case 
there would be no question of IP violation.
Or maybe somebody can do a clean room implementation provided Nvidia 
agrees to some NDA, and the resultant work is acceptable to Nvidia 
provided that it is free of their IP.. Many hardware vendors do resort 
to these to get their hardware working properly under Linux, and in some 
cases, the Linux driver has proved to be a better driver than their 
Windows counterparts, albeit with lesser gimmicks/features.
