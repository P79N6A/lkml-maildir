Well... obviously it works for the best case. OTOH, for the worst, it
needs 40bytes for every 2 bits. That's 16000% worse. And for that
nightmare-fragmented 1GB swap, you'll need 5000000bytes... which is
pretty bad.
OTOH 5MB RAM per 1GB swap is not _too_ bad... so we can do it...

Yes, that's okay with me.
