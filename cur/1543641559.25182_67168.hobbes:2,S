Rejected. I found several errors, a couple of strange reverts and some
files being moved to clearly wrong places. It also mixes up multiple
changes.
Andre to make this work I need
	- One change per patch (within reason)
	- An explanation of what it does
For example I've got files you moved and changed, looking at that in
diff is a right pita. I've got a big diff with errors in it (eg gayle in
ppc) I can't easily be sure I can cleanly drop parts of.
Lets start with the file moving. Send me a diff for the Config/Makefile
and a lit of the files to move and where. Gayle I think should be m68k
not ppc (actually Im pretty sure), CMD640 is PCI so why file it in
legacy. "legacy" I took to mean pre PCI rather than "I think its junk"
