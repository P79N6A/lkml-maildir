First, the only mentioned real use of EtherIP I've seen anywhere is to
tunnel old LAN based games that used protocols other than IP :-)
Second, the OpenBSD interoperability issues are very real, and there
is even a Xerox implementation that used an 8-bit instead of a 16-bit
header size.
Third, even the introductory material in RFC3378 mentions that people
are strongly encouraged to use other technologies over EtherIP.
Fourth, and finally, if GRE can provide the same functionality then
that plus the first three points makes EtherIP something we really
should not latch onto.
And if it doesn't go in, it's not the end of the world.  Anyone can
maintain and use the external patch, and if usage gets widespread
enough we'll of course be required to reevaluate integration.
So I think we should pass on this for now.
