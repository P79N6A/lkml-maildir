Looks good from a first look.
One issue is that you will need people to run the mcelog cron job
and create /dev/mcelog, otherwise they won't see any non fatal
warnings anymore.
I'm actually considering to add a tasklet/bit on x86-64 to printk
a one line warning when any events are in the log. Perhaps that
would be a good idea here too to make the migration smoother.
