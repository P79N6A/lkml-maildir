The obvious solution is to use a journalling filesystem, like ext3.
I've put ext3 on my dev box, and now I never need to fsck when I
crash the kernel.

SSH is good if you can actually get net access to the system.

I made a small switch out of the keyboard lock (10 kOhm resistor +
wire), and attached it to the serial port on my router box.  I have upsd
listening on the serial port, and it does a shutdown for me.  I think
the schematics for the switch were in the UPS HOWTO or similar.  I didn't
even have to write a line of code (OK, I added beeps to /etc/init.d/halt
to let me know when it was finished).
Cheers, Andreas
