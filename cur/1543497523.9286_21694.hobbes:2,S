Hi,
I just upgraded my kernel to 2.2.9 (from 2.0.36), now my ttyS3 doesn't want to be initialized anymore. Initialisation of the device wasn't a problem with 2.0.36
When I use setserial  /dev/ttyS3 irq 7 skip_test autoconfig it tells me the resource is busy. setserial -a /dev/ttyS3 tells me the same (and /dev/cua3 also)
No program can use ttyS3
ttys3 is an internal modem I use for fax and answering machine. I have an other internal modem on ttyS2. This device gets initialized still without any problems. Both modems are PNP disabled, with IRQ's set on the card
Any ideas ?
Regards
Cor
