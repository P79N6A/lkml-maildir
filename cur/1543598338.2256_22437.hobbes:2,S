Why don't we also switch to a cryptographically secure algorithm for
/dev/urandom?  Then we could seed it with a value from /dev/random and we would
have a known number of cryptographically secure pseudorandom values.  Once we
reach the end of the png cycle, we could re-seed it with another value from
/dev/random.
Would this be a valid solution, or am I totally off my rocker?
