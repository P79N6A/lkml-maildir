Hi Duncan,
I recently switched from the userspace speedtouch driver to the in-kernel one. 
However, on my rev 4.0 Speedtouch 330, I periodically get the message:
ATM dev 0: error -110 fetching device status
I suspect the source of this "error" is the warning message from speedtch:435:
	ret = speedtch_read_status(instance);
	if (ret < 0) {
		atm_warn(usbatm, "error %d fetching device status\n", ret);
		instance->poll_delay = min(2 * instance->poll_delay, MAX_POLL_DELAY);
		return;
	}
Tell me if I'm wrong, but I suspect speedtch_check_status() is called 
periodically to check line status. It may be the case that my modem does not 
like having its status read when it is sending/receiving data (which it is 
constantly doing).
Unfortunately the message eventually fills the dmesg ring buffer. My current 
workaround is to remove the atm_warn() call; everything works fine, but I'm 
concerned that the modem will not automatically reconnect if the connection 
drops as a result of the failure from speedtch_read_status().
Any suggestions for debugging this further? From a quick google I've noticed a 
recent Fedora bugzilla entry mentioning this same problem.
