This is the second report of this I've heard, and I really have no good
explanation for it.

try adding some instrumentation to __pci_register_driver and the functions
it calls.
oh, one thought.. do you have CONFIG_PCI_MULTITHREAD_PROBE set?
I'm wondering if the probing is racing with another driver which is claiming
the same PCI ID. (Edac, or watchdog for example)
