It was clocking the MII management interface (MDC) at 500 Hz so each PHY
register access took some 130 ms, and many registers accesses were being
done on initialization. According to the datasheet, the maximum
frequency for MDC is 2.5 MHz.  Delays have been adjusted accordingly.

Reduce delays when reading/writing the PHY registers so we clock the
MII management interface at 2.5 MHz (the maximum according to the
datasheet) instead of 500 Hz.
