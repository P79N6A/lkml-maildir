I guess that's why Apple doesn't want to make its X11 support too good.
Otherwise the Mac world would get flooded with X11 programs that don't
work the same way as the rest of the Mac programs.

I honestly hope you're right.  The more cooperation we have between
GNOME and KDE and everyone else, the better.

GNOME has HAL, their hardware abstraction layer, which uses (I assume)
the kernel's facility to interact with the hardware.  If someone ports
GNOME to Windows, then HAL would use the Windows way to interact with
the hardware.  I can't see why it can't do something similar with the
filesystem.  Because who knows, maybe Gnumeric will need to access
substream data under Windows to open an Excel file properly.  Or
Nautilus may have to read ... OS/2 extended attributes :-/
