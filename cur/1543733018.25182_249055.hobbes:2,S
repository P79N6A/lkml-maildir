So, how in reality is our pepsi swigging spotty quake player, going to know
he needs to run off to download the latest dri snapshot if he is so clueless ?
If our imaginary hero is so clueless he won't even know what a 'dri' is,
and nor should he. Let alone know that he needs to go grab a patch for
some subsystem.
Regardless of what the folks at Tungsten would like you to believe,
end-users *do not* like changing bits of the distro from random sources.
"a 3d driver from here, a scsi driver from there". Next time they update
their system with their update tool of choice, it pulls down a security
errata for their kernel, and whoops, their 3d has gone, their scsi controller
disappears etc etc.
The next time they see a kernel security errata available they remember the
incident, and what happens? They blame the distro for breaking their setup,
and live with a potentially insecure system.
If dri stuff isn't getting into distros fast enough, take it up with the
distros.  For Fedora at least, we have a very quick turnaround right now.
