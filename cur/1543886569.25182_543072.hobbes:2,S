I'm not so certain now that we know it's the jiffies wrap point :-)
The fixes in question are attached below and they were posted and
discussed on netdev:

    [NET] link_watch: Eliminate potential delay on wrap-around
    
    When the jiffies wrap around or when the system boots up for the first
    time, down events can be delayed indefinitely since we no longer
    update linkwatch_nextevent when only urgent events are processed.
    
    This patch fixes this by setting linkwatch_nextevent when a
    wrap-around occurs.

    [NET] link_watch: Always schedule urgent events
    Urgent events may be delayed if we already have a non-urgent event
    queued for that device.  This patch changes this by making sure that
    an urgent event is always looked at immediately.
    I've replaced the LW_RUNNING flag by LW_URGENT since whether work
    is scheduled is already kept track by the work queue system.
    The only complication is that we have to provide some exclusion for
    the setting linkwatch_nextevent which is available in the actual
    work function.
