If you look at Pavel's posts WRT swsusp2, he has taken this position 
before, that lack of functionality in {something} is no justification to 
introduce a new solution, and that the limitations of {something} can be 
addressed by incremental improvement. Like any good idea, this can be 
carried to extremes.
Don't take it personally, just write working code people can patch in. 
When your code has the features you mentioned it will be highly useful 
and hopefully ported to many devices. I guess security monitoring is an 
"industrial image processing application," which interests me. At the 
moment I would call it an impressive proof of concept, but you have many 
useful ideas for its future.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
