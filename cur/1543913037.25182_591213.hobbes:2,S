This is a lot more relevant than much of the ongoing
discussion, so perhaps people could take a moment to read it over.

Subject: Re: That whole "Linux stealing our code" thing
Hi!
I just returned from vacation where I was offline for about two weeks.
So I totally missed the incidence and all the surrounding discussion.
I'm just digging through many many mails in my inbox from OpenBSD
users and developers, Linux people, GNU/freesoftware people, misc *BSD
people, and obviously from some trolls.
I don't want to restart the discussion but I just want to say and
repeat a few words:
- I will not release or agree to release my code under either the GPL
or any kind of a "dual"-license.
- The ISC-style license must remain including the copyright notice and
even the warranty term.
- Thanks to the OpenBSD community and especially to Theo de Raadt for
entering into it and for defending my rights as the author of the
controversial code.
- This is eating our time. Every few weeks I get a new discussion
about licensing of the atheros driver etc. blah blah. Why can't they
just accept the license as it is and focus on more important things?
I will talk to different people to get the latest state and to think
about the next steps. I don't even know if the issue has been solved
in the linux tree. But PLEASE DON'T SPAM ME with any other mails about
this, even if you want to help/support me, I will talk to the relevant
people in private.
Thanks!
reyk
