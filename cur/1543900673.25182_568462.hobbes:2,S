Hi,
I´m using RedHat Enterprise Server 4 Update 3 (kernel 2.6.9-34.ELsmp)
I was listing the contents of /proc/pid/status file and I came up with
a value of:
...
VmLib: 4294948464 kB,
...
Is this a known bug?
the process in question uses a lot of threads ~100 but there are no
memory leaks...
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
Marcos David
