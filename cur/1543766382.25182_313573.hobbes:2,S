Right.  Still, I'd like to drop function names from debug messages
and replace "suspend" with "swsusp" in some messages.  I'll send another
patch for it after 2.6.12 (please let me know if you don't think it's a good
idea ;-)).
For now, please drop the patch altogether.

It's just confusing.  Initially, I didn't intend to change it, but then I read it
and thought "What overlaps?".  In data_read() there's nothing that could
overlap with anything else ...
