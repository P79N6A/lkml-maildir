Hi Erich!  Apologies for the long response delay...  I think our mail 
server must be a bit lagged.  ;)
It looks good to me.  As far as this comment:
+/*
+ * Returns the number of the first CPU on Node 'node'.
+ * Slow in the current implementation.
+ * Who needs this?
+ */
+/* #define __node_to_first_cpu(node) pool_cpus[pool_ptr[node]] */
+static inline int __node_to_first_cpu(int node)
No one is using it now.  I think that I will probably deprecate this 
function in the near future as it is pretty useless.  Anyone looking for 
that functionality can just do an __ffs(__node_to_cpu_mask(node)) 
instead, and hope that there is a reasonably quick implementation of 
__node_to_cpu_mask.

I agree!  Linus or another maintainer, please pick this up.  These 
macros should be implemented intelligently on as many architectures as 
possible, now that they're beginning to be used in more and more places.
Cheers!
