BTW you kill threading.

Yup. And exported symbols for the linker.

Yes, this is a general problem with integrated c/c++ stuff like
Win-Visual C++. People think that they can mix it freely, in fact they
are using *only* C++ (it just happens that some part of the source is
compilable with a C compiler, but since you compile everything with the
C++ compiler pressing F9, no one sees the difference).
Why do you think are all these "#ifdef _cpluplus" stuff in the header
files for?

Try linking also in the user space, not only compilation.
Second read in the standards about the difference between hosted and
standalone environments and think on the differences.

We re on linux-kernel@ here, so we don't care *here* for user-space
software (only for the interface - i.e. sys-calls).
And for embedded usage C++ is unsusable in user-space too since it will
ex-bloat the whole software if people simply pull-in usual and/or common
C++ libraries like the STL and use them without knowing how much object
code they explode with it (if used without thinking).

you loose some nice features and checking).

Is is impossible anyways since the in-kernel interfaces are probably
quite different (though I don't know anything about ).

First, how much of it is really the source of a kernel driver (in the
sense of a Unix/Linux kernel driver)?
And second, no one expects that you convert your driver source. Just
write it from scratch (since you know the internals of the hardware
quite well it should take only a few weeks).
