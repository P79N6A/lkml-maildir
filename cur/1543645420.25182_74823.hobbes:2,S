Oh, thanks for pointing this out. I'll fix it for the next realease.

Well, so far the only x86 notifier is the one in arch/i386/kernel/time.c.
But yes, you're right, it's bad; and so I'll add a workaround for this, too.

Any idea why this is happening??? The only dynamically allocated struct is
struct cpfureq_driver driver; and it is only kfree'd in speedstep_exit...

Thanks. Fixed.
BTW, unfortunately I can't test speedstep.c locally - my notebook has the
old 440?X ISSCL speedstep interface which is undocumented. So I'm really
glad whenever others test speedstep.c. Many thanks,
