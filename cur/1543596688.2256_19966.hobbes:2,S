Would it be possible to use a cramfs image in vmlinux (i.e. real
filesystem image, not an in-kernel-structures fs like ramfs), and map
it directly from the kernel image (it would have to be suitably aligned,
of course)?
This would allow demand paging of files in the image (not too important
for a minimal boot fs, admittedly), and would allow text pages to be
dropped under VM pressure (nice for a fs which holds substantial amounts
of boot-time-only code).
