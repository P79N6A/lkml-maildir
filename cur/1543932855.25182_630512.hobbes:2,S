The following patches merge the mkimage tool into the kernel.  This
utility is used by several arches to create a uImage file suitable for
booting with U-Boot.
As it stands today, a mkuboot.sh script is called, which searches for
the mkimage utility installed on the host system.  This is slightly
suboptimal as it prevents things like automated rebuilds of certain
platforms on those architectures, particularly powerpc.
This is currently based on the mkimage version found in U-Boot 1.3.1.
Comments, flames, suggestions, insults, monetary donations welcome.
