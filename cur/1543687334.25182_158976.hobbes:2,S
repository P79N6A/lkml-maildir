Hiya,
I've got a dumb question: Why is the BKL held on entering sys_reboot() 
in kernel/sys.c:405 ?
It is getting especially interesting on SMP, when one cpu is entering 
sys_reboot, acquires the BKL and then waits (via machine_restart) for 
all other cpus to shut down. If any of the other cpus is executing a 
task which also needs the BKL, we have a nice deadlock.
We've seen this here on 2-way s390, where the other cpu tried to execute 
kupdated() (what did it try that for? Anyway...), which of course 
resulted in a deadlock.
Any enlightenment welcome.
Cheers,
Hannes
