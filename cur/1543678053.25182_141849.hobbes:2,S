Not conciously. I'm not familiar with USA laws, but under Dutch laws, you
have to consiously be aware of your actions. SCO can claim they are tricked
into distributing (not releasing) propietary code under the GPL.

Please remember that this is a *legal* issue, and most of us here are
coders. We may *think* we understand the issues, but we (at least I am) are
looking at it as coders, not lawyers.

Doesn't matter. SCO claims that relatively tiny portions of their unix were
copied into Linux.
