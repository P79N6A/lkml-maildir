I don't think you can get or get the multi count currently, it just uses 
the best supported value.

Not sure about these ones.. Does anything show up in dmesg when you do this?

This setting is not meaningful for anything using DMA.

I think they were referring to physically hotplugging the drive. This is 
more practical if you have a removable drive caddy, or if the drive is 
hooked up through eSATA.
