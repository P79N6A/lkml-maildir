I tried that before, and it gave humongous kernels that worked differently
(due to different compilation flags/stuff moved around in memory/whatever).
So I did it the hard way. Affected is drivers/block/ide.c:init_hwif_data().
Now I'm working at a testcase for egcs (I'm pretty sure it is a compiler
bug, I can't see anything fishy in the function itself).
Stay tuned for more exciting developments ;-)
