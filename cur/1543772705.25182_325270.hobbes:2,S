I would guess that the end result would be a mixed strategy, where some
things (e.g., the existing CONFIG_PREEMPT) are intermingled with the
rest of the Linux code based, while other things (e.g., nanokernel
implementations) are in separate directories.  But this is quickly
getting -way- outside of my area.
So I must leave this aspect of the discussion to others.

OK.  However, should the discussion get to the point where something
like RTAI-Fusion has realtime versions of system calls that have
globally-visible side-effects (such as I/O, networking, IPC, ...),
then the issue of how to get the non-realtime and the realtime variants
to play nicely with each other will arise.
It may well be that system calls containing such side-effects need to be
Linux-only, or maybe someone will come up with the necessary tricks to
make it all work nicely.  Not particularly worried about it myself --
yet, anyway.  There are plenty of things to worry about before we get
to that point!

Sorry, side issue.
I was responding to your list of combinations of CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT, Adeos,
and Fusion, assuming (probably incorrectly) that you and Kristian were
looking to compare all the possible combinations.  If my assumption is
incorrect, then my question was irrelevant, and I apologize for the noise.
						Thanx, Paul
