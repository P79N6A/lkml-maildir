That's exactly what Andrew does now implement through the hot-fixes
directory [1].
Git doesn't help for the problem that it's currently empty - it's more 
important that people tell Andrew that this or that patch should be made 
available there.

git is the SCM Linus developed to fit his workflow.
Andrew has a completely different workflow, and he has developed the 
tools he needs for his workflow.
As long as they are able to interact (which seems to work without 
problems), there's nothing forcing them to use the same tools.
