Using the struct list_head for this will literally allow you to do _magic_.
Avoiding the linear scan is the last thing this will fix.
It would allow for a lot better/simpler/sound design of all of
the mid layer/SCSI core. Things will be/become easier as you
point out below. Currently the mid-layer queuing is hairy at best.
I'm all for it.

Great!
Once you're on that train, you may want to rethink the whole queuing
mechanism of the mid-layer (straight from sd/etc and internally down to LLDD)
for an improved design.
There'd be problems like cmd moving b/n lists is atomic, only cmd movers
can actually cancel a command, move before calling queuecommand(), etc,
but is nothing extraordinary.

No, it certainly is NOT!
Granted, by looking at the code it will not be overly clear
who moves what and when, but a 2 page commentary on the design
would only leave one exlaiming ``Aaaaah... such simplicity, so great!''

Right, it's not. This type of queuing mechanism would only make things
more consistent and easy to manipulate.
There'd be logistical issues, but those are easy to figure out
with pen and paper.
