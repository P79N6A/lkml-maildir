I think we have another problem with delayed_works.
cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue() doesn't garantee that the ->func() is not
running upon return. I don't know if it is bug or not, the comment says nothing
about that.
However, we have the callers which seem to assume the opposite, example
	net/ipv4/ipvs/ip_vs_core.c
		module_exit
		    ip_vs_cleanup
		        ip_vs_control_cleanup
		            cancel_rearming_delayed_work
		// done
This is unsafe. The module may be unloaded and the memory may be freed
while defense_work_handler() is still running/preempted.
Unless I missed something, which side should be fixed?
Oleg.
