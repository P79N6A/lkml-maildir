2.4 kernel does differentiate two backslash key on JP 106 keyboard.
When I press lower-right backslash (scancode 0x73), I get keycode
89 on both Linux 2.4 and 2.6.
When I press upper-right backslash (scancode 0x7d), whose key top is
Japanese yen and bar, I get keycode 124 on Linux 2.4 but 183 on Linux
2.6.
Is the change of keycode of upper-right backslash a new feature of
Linux 2.6? What is the advantage of this new feature?
The following is from /usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwerty/jp106.kmap in
Debian:
keycode  89 = backslash        underscore
	control	keycode  89 = Control_backslash
keycode 124 = backslash        bar
	control	keycode 124 = Control_backslash
