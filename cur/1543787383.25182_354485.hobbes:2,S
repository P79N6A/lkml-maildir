AFAIU, demands to get our concepts closer to SAM concepts are actually 
motivated by this: To achieve additional flexibility. (In particular, to 
ease integration of the various transports.)

We implement drivers of initiators. (Well, targets too.) The specs 
describe _what_ initiators do. Thereby they partly describe _how_ 
drivers of initiators (our sw pieces) work.

This is correct. The SAM is what it is --- the SCSI-3 Architecture 
Model, not the architecture model of Linux' SCSI stack.
However it is very desirable to reflect layers and concepts of the SAM 
in our stack. One class of reasons is maintainability. No person is able 
to understand the stack; nor is a person able to consume and understand 
all or even half of the SCSI specs. No person is able to construct a 
mapping between the whole stack and the whole SCSI-3 Architecture Model 
(in his mind or with pencil and paper...). Therefore there have to be 
_components_ of the stack's architecture model which map 1:1 to 
_components_ of the SCSI-3 Architecture Model.
Fortunately, SAM layers and concepts are already there in the stack, 
although incomplete and incoherent. It will always be disputable _how_ 
complete and coherent our software should be in this respect. However it 
is out of a question that our software's architecture model might 
arbitrarily differ from the SAM.
