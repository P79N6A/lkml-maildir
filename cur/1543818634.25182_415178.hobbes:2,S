Might be worth mentioning that if you intend to write a driver
that interfaces with any kernel under any license (bar any
kernel that you write yourself), be it Windows, Linux, *BSD,
etc you SHOULD talk to a lawyer as every license has it's
quirks and gotchas.
This is NOT specific to the GPL or the Linux kernel.
