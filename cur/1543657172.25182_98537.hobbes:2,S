The networking core disobeys the rule in the sendfile implementation. 
Depending on the cacheline size, even small TCP packets might disobey 
the rule. The problem is not restricted to drivers.

I agree that the performance will be bad, but like misaligned memory 
access, the arch code should support it. Leave the warning about bad 
performance in the documentation, and modify the drivers where it 
actually matters.
Your new documentation disagrees with the current implementation, and 
that is just wrong.
And in the case of networking, someone must do the double buffering. 
Doing it within dma_map_single() would avoid modifying every pci driver.
