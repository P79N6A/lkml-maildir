AFAIK a child doing setsid() has no effect whatsoever on any wait*()
done by the parent. It just sets a new session leader.
But SIGCHLD set to SIG_IGN instead of SIG_DFL is a perfect explanation.
Rereading alan's reply I suddenly got it: "random status" didn't refer
to the &status arg but to the signal status. SIG_IGN is inherited I
guess so a
	signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_DFL);
once before the fork() should fix it. Hmm, so actually our parent should
have reset SIGCHLD before exec'ing this code. This could cause more
problems.
