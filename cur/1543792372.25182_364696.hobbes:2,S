Ahoy.  Excellent.  Compare my personal todo list item:
35.for kernel-doc: make some fields :private: so that a description is not
    expected for them.
Just to be clear about the usage, the kernel-doc script switches from
public to private upon seeing a /*-style comment with the strings
"private:" or "public:" in it.  Right?
Yes, a lot of those USB header fields did need some help.
That's why my todo item was there.
