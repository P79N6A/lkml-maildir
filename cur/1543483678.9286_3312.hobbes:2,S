	This isn't probably the best time to ask about this now, but
	let's try to keep it small. :-)
	I happen to have a ALI Alladin V chipset in this mb, and it
	isn't supported - What I would like to know, is that if there
	is someone working with support or considering to do that.
	In case there is a need for tester, I am willing to help.
