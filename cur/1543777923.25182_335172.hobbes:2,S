Just an FYI, if you are trying to emulate the actual behavior of
msleep() in the current kernel via this function, then you need to
place the sleep in a while-loop. Please see kernel/timer.c::msleep().
Your version will wake up on wait-queue events, while msleep() in the
current kernel does not.
Thanks,
