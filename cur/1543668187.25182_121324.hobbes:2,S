Hello all.
I'm assuming that this was a freak occurrence as it's the first time 
it's ever happened, but...
Running kernel 2.4.20 on an AMD Athlon XP.  This morning it crashed 
just after some ftp-ing backup routines started.  Here's the log...
Mar 28 02:10:22 backup ctl_cyrusdb[5015]: checkpointing cyrus databases
Mar 28 02:10:22 backup ctl_cyrusdb[5015]: done checkpointing cyrus 
databases
Mar 28 02:14:39 backup ftpd[5017]: FTP LOGIN FROM 10.10.10.246 
[10.10.10.246], backup
Mar 28 02:14:49 backup kernel: kernel BUG at buffer.c:509!
Mar 28 02:14:49 backup kernel: invalid operand: Mar 28 16:05:05 backup 
syslogd 1.4-0: restart.
Mar 28 16:05:05 backup syslog: syslogd startup succeeded
Mar 28 16:05:05 backup kernel: klogd 1.4-0, log source = /proc/kmsg 
started.
Mar 28 16:05:05 backup kernel: Inspecting /boot/System.map
Hope it serves some purpose for someone.
Thanks.
Lee.
