Wow, works for me, Broadcom 94306. [Well, I do not have second wifi to
test right now, but module loads, I can iwconfig it etc.] I'd add this

 1. Compile the driver
 ---------------------
 * You need kernel 2.6.0-test8 or higher!
-* Make sure your kernel complied without framepointer and Sleep-inside-spinlock debugging
-  See the kernel hacking menu
+* Make sure your kernel complied without framepointer
+  (CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER unset) and Sleep-inside-spinlock

And perhaps this script gets usefull? [Fancy version might download
that package using wget then unzip it ;-).]
