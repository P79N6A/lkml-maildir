Hi,
Is there any plan to support the ``clock_gettime'' system call
and all its family (clock_settime, clock_getres) ?
I know that gettimeofday and settimeofday, will provide equivalent
functionnalities, but the POSIX.1b appeal of clock_gettime might
be required, as well as the finer granularity, down to nano-seconds
(even though such an accuracy is debatable as of today).
Thanks in advance for any feed back!
