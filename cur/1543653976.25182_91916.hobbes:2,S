Hey guys,
I'm not subscribed right now, but I have a major problem.  For some reason,
sometimes when I startup either gpm or X, my keyboard gets remapped, so that
several of the keys return keycode 0x70 or 0x71, while others return 0x56, and
the rest return extended e0/e1 keycodes.  I'm unsure why this happens.  It
started happening when I installed dri drivers off dri.sf.net, but even after
removing those drivers, deleting the kernel source tree, and starting from
scratch, it still happens.  I'm at a loss, so if someone can shed some light on
this, I'd be grateful.
this happens sporadically, so not exactly sure what the problem is.  Hopefully
this won't happen when I get a USB mouse/keyboard for christmas :) /me crosses
fingers.
Thanks in advance,
Justin Hibbits
