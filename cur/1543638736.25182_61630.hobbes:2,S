Why are we kicking IDE devices out of ``legacy'' mode?
Last I checked that was a very sensible mode for IDE devices to operate in.
The IRQ and pio resources are where a lot of software expects them,
and by using an isa-irq there are fewer shared interrupts.
Plus on the few motherboards I tried it on, the pci-irq line didn't
even appear to be hooked up.  In these cases I'm thinking of the
on-board IDE controller.
