My point was a bit different:
Harald's action was meant as an example, that such things can be brought 
to court in virtually every country in the world.
And a court decision in e.g. the USA might not have any influence on a 
court decision in e.g. Germany.
Some people seem to think that it was enough if something was OK 
according to US law - but that's simply wrong.
