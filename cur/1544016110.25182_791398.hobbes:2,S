Dunno Ingo, it's dubious. I don't like the idea
to start including types.h into any kind of *.S
with #ifndef __ASSEMBLY__ protection. We export it
into user space and I don't remember if it mentioned
somewhere that user is not allowed to use -D__ASSEMBLY__.
Someone more experienced (then me) in this area should
asked first :-)
