This can be true for any bridge.
Most arches, however, simply block until config write completes - this is why
driver doesn't issue any MMIO writes - and this is what we are looking for here
- a way to block the CPU until split completion for config write arrives.
By the way, e.g. the PCI Express spec says:
"Read Requests and I/O or Configuration Write Requests are permitted to be
blocked by or to pass other Read Requests and I/O or Configuration Write Requests."
so it is not clear that doing a config read will always flush all config writes
as you want.
