These patches are ontop of the patches I sent (and which Muli resent a
few days afterward).  Those patches fix a major problem and need to make
it into 2.6.18.

This is mostly error path bugs and clean-up/code re-org (to save memory
and make things more cache friendly).  The changes are mostly minor.
If you are uncomfortable with applying them, we can separate patches 3,
4, and 5 (which are the bug fixes) from the rest and send those to you.
Is that more acceptable?
Thanks,
Jon
