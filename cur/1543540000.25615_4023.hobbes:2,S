   So what are the advantages/problems associated with using readw,
   writel and the like? Is this a way to get compatibility across
   various platforms?
Derefencing the return pointer from ioremap() and not using the readw
etc. interfaces is almost guarenteed to not work on any platform
other than x86.  On Sparc64 for example the return from ioremap()
happens to be a physical address and will OOPS on you on any direct
derefence of that pointer, readw() and friends do the access in the
correct manner.
Later,
