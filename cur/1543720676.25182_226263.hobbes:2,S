Yep, specSFS (an NFS benchmark) shows this up quite badly. I think Jose
and Martin were looking at strategies for keeping the dcache under
control.
This was on a machine with only 64GB of RAM, if we had an NFS server
with more memory then its reasonable to want more memory dedicated to
dentries. At that point we either need to increase the hash or look at
using another structure.
