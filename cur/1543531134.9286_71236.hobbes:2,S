   Note that malloc() is documented as allocating memory, regardless of
whether you actually touch it or not. Any programmer relies on that.

   So you have a broken malloc().

   Then using malloc() to create the matrix in one go is the wrong thing to
do.

   An lseek()/write() combination is documented to permit the file system
to create a sparse file. malloc() etc. has no permission to create sparse
memory blocks. That's why.
