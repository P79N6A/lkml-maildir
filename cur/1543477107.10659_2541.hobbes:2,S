   Well, we might use a bit more sophisticated scheme: upon subscription
to the list, get AS number of primary MX of subscribient's address
and then choose exploders on AS basis (for example by analysing
the RIPE/RA database). This isn't trivial to implement, but it would
probably give very reasonable results.
