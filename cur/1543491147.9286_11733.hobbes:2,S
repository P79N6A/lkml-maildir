I didn't try your shrink_mmap enhancement for the moment, but just reading
you, it looks great. I will have a look at it and give it a try when I
will have time for, may-be to-morrow, and let you know if I have some 
comments.
By the way, it seems that there are some other O/Ses that still use the
clock algorithm and donnot perform that bad. Anyway, just thinking of
system with large amount of memory really used disqualified the clock
algorithm against a simple LRU, in my opinion.
