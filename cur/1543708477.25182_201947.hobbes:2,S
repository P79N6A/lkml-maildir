No it is related to the point and grunt option in emacs:
I would guess it is a problem in the emacs interface where one points at a 
location in the code window and enters a command to set a break point ( I think 
it is "^x " (control X space)).  It would appear that emacs then only sends the 
file name to gdb rather than the full path.
This is not a show stopping problem, only confusing.  Once gdb figures out the 
right source, all is well.  I usually do it by setting a break point at the 
function by name, thus avoiding the point and grunt thing.
