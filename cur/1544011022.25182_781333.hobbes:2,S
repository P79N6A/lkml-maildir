We can also hybridise b. and d.:
e. When we're in interrupt context, if TS is clear, then we defer
the operation to a thread.  Otherwise if user-space has touched
the FPU we save the state, if not then we simply clear TS.  In
either case we perform the operation immediately and then reset
TS if user-space didn't touch the FPU.
This is based on the fact that it should be fairly rare for us
to interrupt a kernel FPU/SSE operation.  The common case would
be interrupting a user process or a kernel context which is not
engaging in any kernel FPU operations.
Cheers,
