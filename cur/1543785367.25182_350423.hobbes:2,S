As I mentioned that HBA's can handle an 8 byte lun. But as far as the driver
is concerned, it does not populate all the level.
So if you look at the "struct cmd_type_7" iocb in qla_fw.h lun field is an 8 byte field.
struct cmd_type_7 {
	.......
 uint8_t lun[8];                 /* FCP LUN (BE). */
	.........
}
Here's the snippet
of the code where the driver builds iocb for ISP24XX in  qla24xx_start_scsi():
	 /* Set LUN number*/
        cmd_pkt->lun[1] = LSB(fclun->lun);
        cmd_pkt->lun[2] = MSB(fclun->lun);
Hope this clarifies the confusion if any.
