Well, of course I had a printk in my first version of this, but, after
a few days I deleted it...  We can get it back, if you like.  Also,
the 200ms delay I am using here is less than the smalest delay
possible (at least on PC kbds that I am aware of) that is 250 ms, and
this is applicable only to the _second_ identical scancode in a row,
therefore it only affects kbd delay, not kbd rate - so no probl with
short autorepeats.
