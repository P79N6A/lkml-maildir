Subject: Including STRTOK_R in a LSM

I am aware strtok was removed from the kernel in 2002. However strtok_r 
is more desirable than strsep as I do not want to know about 'blank 
fields' (2 consecutive delimiters). Is it acceptable to simply include 
the strtok_r code in my security module? or should I create a wrapper 
for strsep to ignore blanks?
Thanks,
