As a non-apic based SMP implementation, I don't think there was ever any
dissent about the latter.

Density or lack of it is pretty much irrelevant nowadays since the CPU
map iterators are sparse efficient.  Whether x86 PC chooses to avail
itself of this or not is the business of the PC subarch maintainers.
The vast marjority of non-x86 SMP implementations still have sparse (or
at least physical only) CPU maps.

Erm, it does?  How?  My statement is that introducing subarch specific
#defines into subarch independent header files is a problem (which it
is).  If you grep for subarch defines in the rest of the arch
independent headers, I don't believe you'll find any.  This would rather
tend to show that for the last seven years, the subarch interface has
been remarkably effective ....

Yes, that should work.
