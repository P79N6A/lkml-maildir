i've already admitted that this script is going to generate false
positives for a number of reasons, the most common one being using the
"CONFIG_" prefix outside the context of Kconfig.
technically, of course, that doesn't hurt but it sure would make the
code clearer if that prefix was officially reserved for Kconfig stuff.

p.s.  "CONFIG_" prefix aside, i would think it's also a bit yucky to
be checking for the definition of a preprocessor symbol that you've
already hardcoded out of existence in the same source file.  :-)
