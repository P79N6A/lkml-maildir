 Ah, no problem -- even with the right keys you may sometimes get lost in 
the results.

 Well, enable_irq() and disable_irq() themselves are nesting, so they are 
not a problem.  OTOH, free_irq() does not seem to maintain the depth count 
correctly, which looks like a bug to me and which could trigger regardless 
of whether flush_scheduled_work() or cancel_work_sync() was called.
 The reason is CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ which makes a simulated interrupt event 
be sent at the end of free_irq().  It looks like a problem that is 
complementary to one I signalled here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/12/82
with respect to request_irq(), where, similarly, such an interrupt event 
is sent at the beginning.  It looks like nobody was concerned back then, 
but perhaps it is time to do a better investigation now and propose a 
solution.
 I'll think about it and thanks for your inquisitiveness that has led to 
these conclusions.
