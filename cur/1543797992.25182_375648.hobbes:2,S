Please don't.
It's a coding style issue. We put our variable declarations where people 
can _find_ them, not in random places in the code.
Putting variables in the middle of code only improves readability when you 
have messy code. 
Now, one feature that _may_ be worth it is the loop counter thing:
	for (int i = 10; i; i--)
		...
kind of syntax actually makes sense and is a real feature (it makes "i" 
local to the loop, and can actually help people avoid bugs - you can't use 
"i" by mistake after the loop).
But I think you need "--std=c99" for gcc to take that.
