Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.0-test4 (#7) - correct name field breakage in zoran driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hey,
I suddenly noticed that 2.6.0-test4 seems to have removed the struct
device->name field, apparently for memory consumption reasons. Linus
changed this to pci_name((zr)->pci_dev) in my driver, and that's almost
correct, except that it is the PCI device ID, and I'm not supposed to
touch it. Also, since it's only 4 bytes, all my device names now show
like 'DC1' (this should be 'DC10plus') and alike.
The attached patch fixes this by going back to the behaviour that we
used in 2.4.x: we use a separate name field in our private driver
struct.
I promise I won't send in more patches after this one for today. :).
Ronald
