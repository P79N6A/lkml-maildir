Subject: [PATCH] memory corruption in i2o
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Some weeks back "VDA@port.imtp.ilyichevsk.odessa.ua" reported in
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100633930427682&w=2
a bug in an i2o header file that causes kernel memory corruption.  
The obvious fix was posted several times; this one from Andreas Dilger
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100688659819007&w=2
is typical.  The fix appears not to have been picked up in 2.4.17-pre8.
There is no i2o maintainer listed in MAINTAINERS.
With a 2.4.17 release candidate coming up, it's probably time to 
apply it.
The original posting noted several other similar bugs, for which it
and subsequent postings suggested fixes, e.g.
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100634117104111&w=2
Is anybody going to pick up _any_ of these fixes, or do they just rot
until enough kernel crashes get reported with enough detail to implicate
the identified bugs?
