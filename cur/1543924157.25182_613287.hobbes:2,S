Well you would be able to specify how much will remain. If not it will 
just keep the 2M reserve around.

Each tunnel needs 4 bytes per cpu?

Na. Some reasonable upper limit needs to be set. If we set that to say 
32Megabytes and do the virtual mapping then we can just populate the first 
2M and only allocate the remainder if we need it. Then we need to rely on 
Mel's defrag stuff though defrag memory if we need it.
