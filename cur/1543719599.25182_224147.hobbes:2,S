Yeah, you and Andi and I (and others, I think) had this discussion, but it ended like this:

   I've had good experiences with zero extension at least so far.
   Would be probably good just for consistency.
So be it, the convention is that all arguments are zero extended from
32-bits to 64-bits when the syscall is invoked.
