Not just embedded fdtable, but also the embedded fdsets. I would expect
count, fdt, fdtab and the fdsets to fit into one cache line in 
some archs.

next_fd has to be in struct fdtable. It needs to be consistent
with whichever fdtable a lock-free reader sees.

But not close_on_exec_init or open_fds_init. We would update them
on open/close.
Some benchmarking would be useful here.
