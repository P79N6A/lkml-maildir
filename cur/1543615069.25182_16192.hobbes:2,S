Matt,
This was a point I tried to make but failed.
Not all SCB/SRB's are highmem tested but OEM's claim support.
This I tried to have BIO change to do highmen drop to the lowmem window
upon entry of the request and this would have prevent most form breaking,
but this did not seem to get warm acceptance.
