I've done some testing of several problem cases.
1) fuse writable mmap patches + bash_shared_mapping
2) writes in a setup involving a loop dev
  a) ext3 over loop over ext3
  b) ext3 over loop over fuse-passthrough over ext3
  c) ext3 over loop over ntfs-3g
Without the patch, in all the cases I've seen deadlocks or long
stalls.  With the patch, I could not reproduce this in any of the
cases.  As predicted, the patch is performing well in this respect :)
2a is the simplest to reproduce (2.6.22, dual core, 1GB ram)
  dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/p5 bs=1M seek=4999 count=1
  mkfs.ext3 -F /tmp/p5
  mkdir /tmp/m5
  mount -oloop /tmp/p5 /tmp/m5
  dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/m5/foo bs=1M count=4000
The second dd can stall for indefinite amounts of time.  Kicking it
with sync can get it moving, but it relapses after some time.
Even with the per-device-throttling patch, case 2 shows an nr_dirty
elevated far above the 10% limit, reaching 40% or higher.  I believe,
this is due to a missing balance_dirty_pages() call in the loop
device.  And indeed the anomaly can be solved by adding this patch:
