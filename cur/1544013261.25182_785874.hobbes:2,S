EMBEDDED is for a large assortment of things, all of which are of the form:
General users won't want to change Y, but if I know I don't need Y, there is
no point in supporting Y in the kernel.
Y might be "this kernel doesn't need sysctl"
Y might be "support for hot-plug"
Y might be "printk"
Y might be "support generic CPUs"
See the pattern?
Yes, we probably could have come up with a better name than EMBEDDED for
that list of optionals.
CONFIG_TRAINED_TECHNICIANS_ONLY_NO_USER_SERVICABLE_PARTS_INSIDE maybe?
