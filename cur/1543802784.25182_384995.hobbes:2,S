Subject: [2.6.15-git6,-git7] hard lockup on FC4 exiting X (Intel I915)

Dell Latitude D610, Pentium M @ 1.86Ghz, 2GB RAM
 running uptodate FC4. 100% reproducable since
 2.6.15-git6, no problem up to -git5. Log in to VT1, run
 startx, fire up a gnome-terminal, exit it, Desktop->Logout...
 at this point the mouse arrow stills and the box locks up,
 keyboard dead, no response to pings.
Card is, according to lspci -v,
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile
915GM/GMS/910GML Express Graphics Controller (rev 03) (prog-if 00
[VGA])
        Subsystem: Dell: Unknown device 0182
        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 11
        Memory at dff00000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=512K]
        I/O ports at ec38 [size=8]

Doesn't happen on -git6 on my older laptop (Latitude C640,
 Pentium IV @ 1.8Ghz, 1GB RAM, Radeon Mobility 7500), so
 it definitely is hardware-related.
Diff'ing the dmesg boot log and the Xorg log from the latest
 working version to the latest available version, the relevant
 lines would seem to be these:

Something to do with the PCI Express stuff ?
Available for more detailed info and/or testing to interested parties :)
Thanks in advance, ciao,
