As you say, this is religion. Secondly, there need not be any logic.
But thirdly, if you insist: The first four are about flow of control.
We all agree they have spaces - it is Linux kernel standard.
On the other hand, sizeof is an arithmetical expression, often part
of larger expressions. Now expressions like
	sizeof (*foo)+1
might be confusing, and
	sizeof(*foo) + 1
shows more clearly what the parsing is.
