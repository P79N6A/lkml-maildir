I'm seeing this on bootup on my laptop with recent kernels (currently 
2.6.20-rc6-mm3):
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
IRQ handler type mismatch for IRQ 6
current handler: wbsd

  =======================
floppy0: Unable to grab IRQ6 for the floppy driver
It looks like wbsd is being loaded first, which being a nice PnP device 
sees that IRQ 6 is available and grabs it. Then the we try to load the 
floppy module (which is hard-coded to use IRQ 6) which fails because 
wbsd already owns IRQ6 (which is fine, there's no floppy controller 
anyway). The mismatch is occurring because wbsd passes IRQF_SHARED 
whereas floppy doesn't. I assume one of the two is likely wrong. Should 
wbsd really be passing IRQF_SHARED here? This is an LPC device which 
uses ISA-style edge triggered interrupts, is it safe to try and share an 
interrupt with this chip anyway?
