Dear Andre Hedrick, 
			I wish to apologise for any untoward behaviour that I may have shown towards you, I have have been zealous, sometimes ignorant, in my approach to a situation with you/others and NVidia.  
	I have neglected to show respect for you in your efforts towards the Linux community, you have spent money, time and effort in dealing with the Linux community, me and many, many others.  
	You often have spent money wisely on our cause, but recieved only ridicule and ruin in return. 
	After discussion with my Legal representatives, we have decided that use of GPL'd code solely made by a company/person(s) (of a partnership nature, under British law) in their own proprietary modules is acceptable, as long as code of a substantial copyrightable nature, to which the company does not have a right to use, is not used, we define substantial as "device/hardware accessing routines, that are not created by programmers on a day to day basis". 
	Further to this, I can guarantee that at this time DM TECH. does not wish to take legal action against you/your company(s). 
	My Company's board of directors has unfortunately decided, that at this time, DM TECH. does not have the necessary motive for taking legal action against NVidia, However if you/anyone believes their copyrighted GPL'd code has been stolen/used improperly by NVidia, DM TECH. will provide you with legal representatives free of charge, to prosecute/investigate your charge.   
	I hope this ends our feud, I hope you continue your work. 
	May I also take my time to congratulate John Bradford on his bug reporting program. 
	It is also my decision to reimplace the conexant winmodem chipset "total GPL" development project, which I hope shall finish beta testing in a weeks time, along with Supra SST drivers which will have the worlds first open source and GPL'd V.92 stack. 
	Thanks to those BETA testers. 
	Happy Birthday, to anyone who's Birthday it is :-). 
	D. McEwan. Joint Leader, DM TECH.
