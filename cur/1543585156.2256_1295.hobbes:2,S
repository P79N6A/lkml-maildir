Hi,
when I came to my computer this morning, I noticed that the file
~/.netscape/history.dat was missing. So I tried to copy over a backup
copy from another computer and got "permission denied". I realized that
the file was still there but not accessible at all, even by root.
Here's an strace of "ls -l ~.netscape/history.dat":
3917  lstat(".netscape/history.dat", 0x804e9bc) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
Then I looked in the kernel log, and no suprise, I found these entries:
vs-13048: reiserfs_iget: bad_inode. Stat data of (381 3930411) not found
vs-13048: reiserfs_iget: bad_inode. Stat data of (12541 173718) not found
The system is a Dual-Celeron with ABIT mainboard (Intel BX chipset) and
IDE disk, recently upgraded to 256 MB of ECC RAM.
How can I recover from this problem without reformatting?
Regards,
hjb
