I need this table to _call_ any of system calls that available to the
process, nothing else. Sys_call_table can be placed in .rodata section
(there was patch a few days ago) to prevent modification from modules.
But why module should not have ability to call any function which is
available from user space?
Almost all of my third-party drivers are broken by this.
What is worse, redhat "backported" this "feature" to their 2.4
patched kernels and now I should distinguish 2.4 and "redhat 2.4"
in my compatibility headers.
