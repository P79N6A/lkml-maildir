Silly. The whole point of watchdog is to reboot a wedged machine. The
reason it's firing is presumably because the userspace watchdog
daemon didn't get a chance to touch the device, so odds that syslog would
get a chance to run are pretty slim.
If you really need a log message, get a serial console.
