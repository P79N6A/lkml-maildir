I don't think you will get better than 90% performance, but if you do
please let me know!  I have written another e100 driver, in an attempt
to transmit and receive small packets at the maximum possible rate.
In tests, it would not even transmit at 100% small packets on our 82558.
(I didn't do that test on our 82559).
Ah well..
Curiously, I found that turning on the interrupt saving microcode slows
the cards down.  It lessens the load on the mainboard CPU, but I am not
using interrupts, I'm polling the memory descriptors 100% of the time,
so the interrupt saving microcode shouldn't affect the mainboard CPU.
It does lower the throughput though.
