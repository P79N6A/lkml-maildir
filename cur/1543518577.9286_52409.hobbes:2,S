Unless it has been updated recently, by "balancing" a 100BaseT and a 2400
baud, you are going to get an effective throughput of 4800 baud. That is
from our experiance with it. You get N times the slowest link where N is
the number of circuits in the group. If you
balance two 33.6K modems and one makes a 14.4 connection, you end up with
28.8. Note that might have been with an older EQL, but it looks to me like
it was doing straight round-robin balancing which can not go faster than
the slowest link * the number of links.
