I think there's another subtle bug in set_blocksize() and
invalidate_buffers(). The problem is that buffers can be moved across
lists and can be moved across the same list while we are sleeping on a
locked buffer. This patch address the problem. I never run it on a clean
2.2.6, but I am doing these things in my sligthly rewritten buffer.c. It
address also the problem described by Alexander in a safer way because
performances after set_blocksize run, are really not an issue, so we can
be lazy.
My patch looks at least safe to me, but probably is better that somebody
will try out it before inclusion (maybe a simple pre-patch will be ok).
Ah, and it fix also the buffer-dirty-in-freelist leakage.
