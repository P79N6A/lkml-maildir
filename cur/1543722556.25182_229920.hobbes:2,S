pci_alloc_consistent (at least on x86-64) does do this. one of the problems
I've seen in experimentation is that GFP_KERNEL tends to allocate from the
top of memory down. this means that all of the GFP_KERNEL allocations are >
32-bits, which forces us down to GFP_DMA and the < 16M allocations.
I've mainly tested this after a cold boot, so after running for a while,
GFP_KERNEL may hit good allocations a lot more.
Thanks,
