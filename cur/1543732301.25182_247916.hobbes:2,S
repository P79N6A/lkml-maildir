Subject: [PATCH][PPC32] Fix the 'checkbin' target
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello.
Currently, the checkbin target on PPC32 isn't quite right.  First, one
of the tests (to ensure that some instructions are known to gas) is
never actually invoked because 'checkbin' doesn't know about stuff set
in .config, so we always have the 'else' case run.  This changes to
always running the test and telling the user to upgrade to at least
binutils 2.12.1.  The next problem is that we were doing $(AS) -o
/dev/null ... in both that test, as well as another.  The problem here
is that the checkbin target is run on the install targets, meaning that
/dev/null will get unlinked when the test passes.  To get around this we
use .tmp_gas_check as the output file instead.
Assuming Sam doesn't object, I hope this can go in quickly.  Thanks.
