If you seriously think that development of *anything* in the free
software world happens by means of whitepapers preceding definition, or
indeed that anything major in the Unix world has ever worked that way,
you're seriously deluded.

Oh, I thought you had *access* to the kernel source. A trivial grep
under the Documentation directory would find it (hint:
Documentation/filesystems/ is a good place to start.)
If you actually wanted to *fix* your program --- if you cared more about
users than being proved right no matter what --- then you'd have been
able to determine that for yourself in seconds.
(But then we all know that's not what you're actually after.)

What a ridiculous request. If people use it, it won't be broken. If it
proves unusable due to flaws, it will change. Sheesh.
(It is not as robust as the syscall interface, but it is still subject
to some degree of change. A trivial google would have made this clear.)
You appear not to understand the difference between development
roadmapped for years in advance by a sclerotic corporation and free
software development. Or perhaps you do understand, and are just being
pointlessly contrary. (I expect the latter is true. You're not stupid.
Just nasty.)
