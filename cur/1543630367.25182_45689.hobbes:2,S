No, putting the EXPORT_SYMBOL into s390_ksyms.c won't work for fsm.o being 
a module. Renaming has the obvious disadvantage that the module name 
changes as well.
I think I see two easy way to resolve the problem:
o backport the Rules.make change (it's been in 2.5 for months w/o even
  anybody noticing it, so it's definitely stable)
o Move the EXPORT_SYMBOL() in drivers/isdn/hisax/fsm.o into
  drivers/isdn/hisax/config.o
