The pesky linux/irq.h include found its way back into drivers/char/vt.c
again (maybe Alan didn't merge it).
linux/irq.h is not required by vt.c, and, since it includes asm/hw_irq.h
which architectures many not provide, generic code should not be including
this file in the first place.
Here's a patch to fix this bogosity up:
