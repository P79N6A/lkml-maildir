Persistent as in: get down on your knees and say "please, please, pretty 
please"?
AFAICT, code is being ignored/rejected for the mere reason that it's not 
considered useful; but who's to say what is useful and what's not?
There should probably be some guideline to indicate what kind of code is 
acceptable and what's not.  You know, something like a constitution.  
Otherwise, we'll probably have a situtation like the jungle, where the weak 
are silently being killed off.
Is that the kind of evolution you are aiming for?
BTW, no troll, really.
Thanks!
