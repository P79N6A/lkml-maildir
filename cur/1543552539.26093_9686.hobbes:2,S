But only if the file is smaller than MIN_READAHEAD * 2, which would be
the case for small files (which would read the whole file anyway, which
is how the page cache behaves today anyway).
?*   If we start reading from the beginning of the file, read in
MIN_READAHEAD pages. Note 
that if the file is smaller then MIN_READAHEAD * 2 limiting ourselves to
MIN_READAHEAD would
result in one "too small" IO
(there's that fixed block size crap biting us in the ass again)
so in that case, just read the whole file.
