Forget it.
You cannot hide anything seriously from root (or equivalent users on
other OSes and so-called OSes) with such attempts (independent how the
process got root - with the correct password or through a security hole
somewhere).
Consider the case that root installed a (patched) DB-server which dumps
the passwords in some logfile. Or root logs from the authentication
framework (be it PAM or something else)

So either you get your own machine or you use different passwords for
different services.
