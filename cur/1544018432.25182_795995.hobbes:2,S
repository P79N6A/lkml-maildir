Yes, that's a rather awful noop; compiling without frame pointers 
reduces this to a single "ret".

I did have some patches to do that at one point.  If you set pgd_val = 
paravirt_nop, then the patching machinery will completely nop out the 
call site.  The problem is that it depends on the calling convention 
using the same regs for the first arg and return - true for 32-bit, but 
not 64.  We could fix that with identity functions which the patcher 
recognizes and can replace with either pure nops or inline appropriate 
register moves.
Also, I just posted patches to get rid of all pvops calls when fetching 
or setting flags in a pte, which I hope will help.
