Ugh, you are right, I missed that this was BSD also, sorry.  It's fine.

That sounds like a pretty broken device :)
I don't know, have your own timer that disconnects it after X seconds if
you haven't gotten the firmware yet?  Don't rely on userspace getting
around to you real quickly, as we have seen lots of problems with
drivers relying on that timeout.

Depends on what that code does.

Again, depends on how your code is structured, and what you are
referencing in that read code.

This isn't BSD :)
