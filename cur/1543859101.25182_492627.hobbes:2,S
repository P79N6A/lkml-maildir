No idea whether this can be a data point or not, but
 here it goes... my P2P box is about to turn 5 days old
 while running nonstop one or both of aMule 2.1.3 and
 BitTorrent 4.4.0 on ext3 mounted w/default options
 on both IDE and USB disks. Zero corruption.
AMD K7-800, 512MB RAM, PREEMPT/UP kernel,
2.6.19-git20 on top of up-to-date FC6.
