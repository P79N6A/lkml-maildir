'Multiple value' files can be made easy to 'write'.  The only
requirement is each 'field' in the file have a unique label.  Then
it's a common associative array, requiring some generic filesystem
write magic to handle the input:
echo "label:1" > /proc/...
The 'generic write magic' would require (at least, without even
more magic) that all /proc files conform to the schema.  This is
probably a _good_ thing.
