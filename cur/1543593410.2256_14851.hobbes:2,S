	It doesn't have to.  In fact, I just set up a RedHat 6.2 Honeypot
a couple of weeks ago researching Bind based worms that are becoming
a problem.  Much to my surprise, that OOB RedHat 6.2 system ran bind
as "named -u named" and was running Bind under a common user id.  RedHat
6.0 runs it as root and I haven't checked 6.1 yet.  Don't know about the
other distros, yet.

	That would be a hint that they MIGHT have been trying to get a
Linux kernel stealth module going.  Several of the worms I'm looking at
include the Adore LKM to hide processes, files, and sockets.  That worm
(as several others like it) also upgrade the version of Bind they broke
in through to prevent further compromise.  There will be a security
advisory out on these worms, probably later this week.
