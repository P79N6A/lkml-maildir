	Just tweak the daemon to update the entropy count correctly using the
appropriate ioctl function (RND_ADD_ENTROPY). Search drivers/chars/random.c
for random_ioctl. I've written several programs that acquire entropy from
various sources and exchange them with the kernel entropy pool. It's not
difficult at all.
