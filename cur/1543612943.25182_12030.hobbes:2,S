Known problem. Your kernel was compiled with different gcc than your
modules were. VMware 3.0 tries 'kgcc', 'egcs' and 'gcc' in this order
of preferrence - so you should do 'CC=gcc vmware-config.pl' if you
have kgcc/egcs installed and you compiled kernel yourself. Verify
that 'cat /proc/version' and 
'objdump -s -j .comment /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc/vmmon.o' both
report same gcc version.
