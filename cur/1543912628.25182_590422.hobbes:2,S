No, it would change once more -- the current, minimal-invasive, variant of 
the fix uses the full_name -> "ehca@12345678", while of_make_bus_id uses 
another format: "12345678.ehca". I don't think this makes much of a 
difference, though, and users shouldn't rely on the bus_id having a 
certain format anyway, so IMHO we can live with this.
