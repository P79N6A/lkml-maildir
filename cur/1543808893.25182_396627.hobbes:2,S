Do "hdparm -c 2 /dev/hdx" first and then read/write to the device
and you should see it. :)
We need to make "hdparm -c 2" (and "hdparm -c 3") unsupported
(see how "io_32bit" setting is handled in ide_add_generic_settings()
and how it can be read-only or read-write setting depending on the
value of drive->no_io_32bit).
To do this we need to set drive->no_io_32bit to 1 (see how
ide_disk_setup() handles it).  Unfortunately 32-bit I/O capability
is based on capabilities of both host and device so we have to
add new flag hwif->no_io_32bit to indicate that host doesn't
support 32-bit I/O.

ide.c, no rush for this one as I have patch ready
