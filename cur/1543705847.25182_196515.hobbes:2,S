Howdie,
I'm seeing some usual messages from dmesg with a kernel that I have
running on a cluster.  I have hyperthreading capable Xeons, Supermicro
mobos, and the nodes have LinuxBIOS (but the mayor does not).  I had to
bump the CONFIG_NR_CPUS to 8 to be able to even see both CPUs on the
nodes.  The messages I see that concern me are:
[on the nodes, where hyperthreading is not activated]:
  WARNING: No sibling found for CPU 0.
  WARNING: No sibling found for CPU 1.
[next occurs on the nodes and the mayor]
  ACPI: System description tables not found
      ACPI-0084: *** Error: acpi_load_tables: Could not get RSDP, AE_NOT_FOUND
      ACPI-0134: *** Error: acpi_load_tables: Could not load tables: AE_NOT_FOUND
  ACPI: Unable to load the System Description Tables
  PCI: Probing PCI hardware
  PCI: ACPI tables contain no PCI IRQ routing entries
So the problem occured independant of what BIOS I have, at least so it
seems.  Links full kernel config and dmesgs are below:
[a node, with linux bios, no HT]

[the mayor, no linux bios, HT activated]

[kernel config used on all machines]

Is there a problem with the kernel or my configuration of it?
