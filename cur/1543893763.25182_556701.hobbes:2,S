So, I've had a look into netpoll and, unfortunately, I don't
think this patch is right...

There are such possibilities:
1. After positive delayed_work_pending(&npinfo->tx_work) test
some work is queued, but there is no guarantee that when running
it'll rearm again, so cancel_rearming_delayed_work can loop again;
2. After negative delayed_work_pending(&npinfo->tx_work) test
a work is just running, eg. waiting on netif_tx_lock, while
kfree(npinfo) is done here (oops?!).
I've found an additional problem here with or without this patch:
after deleting a timer in cancel_rearming_delayed_work() there could
stay a last skb queued in npinfo->txq, and after kfree(npinfo)
we have small memory leak. If I'm right here similar fix is needed
in the current netpoll code: additional npinfo->txq purging only
or maybe the whole cancel_rearming_ changed like this.
I've tried to eliminate these problems in attached below patch
proposal. I'm not sure it's all right: as I've written earlier I
don't know netconsole enough, but it's probably a little better
than above solution.
I've some doubts yet (I didn't have time to check this all):
1. I hope this other schedule_delayed_work() from netpoll_send_skb()
is not possible when netpoll_cleanup() runs - if I'm wrong additional
check of npinfo->refcnt should be done there;
2. I also hope npinfo->refcnt before scheduling should be enough here
- if not - another possibility is adding some locking eg.:
netif_tx_lock before cancel for synchronization.
Of course it would be very nice if somebody could test or verify
this patch more.

Jarek P.
