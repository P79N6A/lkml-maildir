The ip5526 driver was removed way back due to lack of interest.  It
only drove a limited set of cards from one vendor.
The interphase cards used a "real" Tachyon (HPFC-5000) chip.  The
controllers we usually discuss in the context of cpqfc have TachLite
(HPFC-51xx and later).
Tachyon is a really old chip and it's not completely compatible with
TachLite from a programming perspective.  It also doesn't have
contemporary features like - cough - PCI-support.  The
GSC/EISA/PCI/whatever glue chip was vendor-specific.
I'm sure the ip5526 driver could be revived -- it's not very big.  But
I doubt there are many cards out there that haven't been scrapped.
