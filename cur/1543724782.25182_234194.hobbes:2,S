The worst case latency is the one that counts and that is the contended case. If
you could guarantee no contention then the worst case latency would be the
very fast uncontended case, but I doubt there are many (any?) examples of this in
practice. There are valid uses of mutexes with priority inheritance/ceiling protocol;
the poeple making the POSIX standard aren't stupid...

Either use mutexes or POSIX message queues... the latter also are not
intended for realtime use under Linux (though they are meant for it in
POSIX), since they don't allocate memory on creation.

Improving the mutex and mqueue implementations to better support realtime
use would be a significant improvement I think, making Linux quite suitable
for realtime audio use.
