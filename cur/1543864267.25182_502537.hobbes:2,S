I left it out because I need more time to digest what you said. After
looked through ia64's page fault and get_user_pages, I've concluded
that the bug scenario Adam described is impossible to trigger on ia64
due to various constrains and how the virtual address is laid out.
For ia64, the hugetlb address region is reserved at the top of user
space address.  Stacks are below that region.  Throw in the mix, we
have two stacks, one memory stack that grows down and one register
stack backing store that grows up.  These two stacks are always in
pair and grow towards each other. And lastly, we have virtual address
holes in between regions.  It's just impossible to grow any of these
two stacks into hugetlb region no matter how I played it.
So, AFAICS this bug doesn't apply to ia64 (and certainly not x86). The
new check of is_hugepage_only_range() is really a noop for both arches.
