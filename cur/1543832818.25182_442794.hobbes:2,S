[HDRINSTALL] Remove asm/atomic.h from user visibility
This isn't suitable for userspace to see -- the kernel headers are not a
random library of stuff for userspace; they're only there to define the
kernel<->user ABI for system libraries and tools. Anything which _was_
abusing asm/atomic.h from userspace was probably broken anyway -- as it
often didn't even give atomic operation.
