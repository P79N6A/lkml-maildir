personally, I'd prefer to avoid hierarchical
structures wherever possible, because they tend
to make processing and checks a lot more complicated
than necessary, and if we really want hierarchical
structures, it might be more than sufficient to
keep the hierarchy in userspace, and use a flat
representation inside the kernel ...
but hey, I'm all for running a hypervisor under
a hypervisor running inside a hypervisor :)
best,
Herbert
