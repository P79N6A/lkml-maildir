I just DL'ed the tar.gz - that is OK.
The image build I done (using oldconfig) booted, but wouldn't mount disks, and 
a few other errors (like looking for modules - I don't build with modules).
What on earth could cause that then?  Corrupt download?  I would have thought 
nigh on impossible to get one or two errors like that if so?
