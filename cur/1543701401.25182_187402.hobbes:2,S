devfs tried to fix this one by _getting rid_ of those numbers.
Seriously - what are they needed for?  
(Yes, I know why they're needed with /dev on ext2)
Opening a device in devfs went straight to the device from the
inode - no extra lookup of "device numbers"
Numbers were provided mostly for backward compatibility - they
weren't used for the main task of accessing devices.
udev has many other advantages of course, too bad we still
have to carry those numbers around.
