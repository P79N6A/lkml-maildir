Actually, they are already maintaining 2.6.x.y, (x => 11, 12, ...) I was
trying to get them to only maintain 2.6.x.y (x => 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 25, ...)
So maybe it would actually be easier.  But I'm sure they wouldn't be
fooled, since the longer you maintain a fork, the harder it becomes.
I was just making a suggestion, so that if someone else thought it was a
good idea, they could do it.  I personally don't need such a beast, since
I would just stay with the latest 2.6.x anyway.  Since I have that luxury.
