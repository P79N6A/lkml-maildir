DES 40bits and less:  just tell it to the crypto control office
DES more than 40bits: give your keys to the crypto control office
Your own crypto algo: give it to the crypto control office and wait for 
an authorisation to use it.
The declaration must be done by the person who sells the product !
That is, Linus must tell crypto control office who exactly in France 
uses Linux !!!
By use, you must also understand be able to use.
So if crypto is included in Linux, you are simply not allowed to 
download Linux
