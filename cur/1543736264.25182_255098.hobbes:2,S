Hello,
Is there functionality within the kernel to supoort
"resource provisioning"?  As an example, on a muti cpu
machine I would like to limit every users' jobs to no
more than one cpu that they can access so that they
can not "consume" more than one cpu no matter how many
different jobs they launch on the machine. 
Thanks for the help!
Phy
