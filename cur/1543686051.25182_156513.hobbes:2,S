This is true, but at the same time, in Linux CodingStyle patches 
culturally acceptable.  I think the general logic is just "don't go 
overboard; reformat a tiny fragment at a time."

tee hee :)  This is why we have Documentation/CodingStyle, for just this 
type of discussion.
I actually prefer your "author carried ... too far" example, with the 
reasoning:  if you _must_ deviate from CodingStyle, at least don't run 
the damn lines together like
	if (test) foo else bar;
		or
	if (test) foo
	else bar;
The alignment of the statements visually separates out the test more 
clearly.
