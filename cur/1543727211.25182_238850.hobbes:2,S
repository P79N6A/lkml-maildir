Hello, Nigel,
RCU stands for "read-copy update".  The rationale behind the name
is that readers proceed concurrently with updaters, and updaters
must make copies in order for complex updates to appear atomic
to readers.
That said, most uses of RCU simply add and delete items.  Very
few uses do in-place RCU-protected updates.
						Thanx, Paul
