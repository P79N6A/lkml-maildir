Hi all.
I have no objection to anything along these lines. The basic scenario
is simply this:
 1. On ALL architectures except for IA64 and ARM there is a SINGLE
    value for CLOCK_TICK_RATE that is used by several GENERIC drivers.
    Currently, that value is used as a MAGIC NUMBER that corresponds
    to the value in the Ix86 case, which is clearly wrong.
 2. According to the IA64 people, those GENERIC drivers are apparently
    irrelevant for that architecture, so making the CORRECT change of
    replacing those magic numbers in the GENERIC drivers with the
    CLOCK_TICK_RATE value will make no difference to IA64.
 3. The ARM architecture has lots of sub-architectures, as was stated
    here. The ARM version of timex.h includes a sub-arch-specific
    header file which, for MOST of the sub-arch's, already defines
    CLOCK_TICK_RATE to what appears to be an appropriate value. The
    only change I made was to apply a catch-all to cover all of the
    sub-arch's that didn't.
The CLOCK_TICK_RATE value should be defined as a result of doing...
	#include <asm/timex.h>
...but I see absolutely nothing wrong with having that file do...
	#include <asm/arch/timex.h>
...and having that in turn include various other include files that
are specific to that architecture, as per your proposal.
Best wishes from Riley.
