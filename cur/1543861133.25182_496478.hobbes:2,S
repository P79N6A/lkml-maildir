If you are sure there is no circular locking possible
between these two functions and this entry->lock here
isn't endangered by other functions, you could try to
make lockdep "silent" like this: 
        write_lock_bh(&ref_table_lock);
        if (tipc_ref_table.first_free) {
                index = tipc_ref_table.first_free;
                entry = &(tipc_ref_table.entries[index]);
                index_mask = tipc_ref_table.index_mask;
                /* take lock in case a previous user of entry still holds it */
-                spin_lock_bh(&entry->lock, );
+		local_bh_disable();
+		spin_lock_nested(&entry->lock, SINGLE_DEPTH_NESTING);
                next_plus_upper = entry->data.next_plus_upper;
                tipc_ref_table.first_free = next_plus_upper & index_mask;
                reference = (next_plus_upper & ~index_mask) + index;
                entry->data.reference = reference;
                entry->object = object;
                if (lock != 0)
                        *lock = &entry->lock;
/* may stay as is or: */
-                spin_unlock_bh(&entry->lock);
+		spin_unlock(&entry->lock);
+		local_bh_enable();
        }
        write_unlock_bh(&ref_table_lock);
