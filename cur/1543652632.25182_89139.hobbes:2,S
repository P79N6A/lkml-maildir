Hi,
I'm playing with kernel 2.5.47. XFS support is compiled as module and at
boot time, while mounting /home, I get this:
insmod /lib/modules/2.5.47/kernel/fs/xfs/xfs.o failed
Then, trying to modprobe xfs by hand:
/lib/modules/2.5.47/kernel/fs/xfs/xfs.o: unresolved symbol page_states__per_cpu
/lib/modules/2.5.47/kernel/fs/xfs/xfs.o: insmod /lib/modules/2.5.47/kernel/fs/xfs/xfs.o failed
/lib/modules/2.5.47/kernel/fs/xfs/xfs.o: insmod xfs failed
I'm using modutils 2.4.19
ciao,
Luca
