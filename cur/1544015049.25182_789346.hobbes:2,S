There's also one alternative: gcc's inlining algorithms are extensibly
tunable with --param. We might be able to find a set of numbers that
make it roughly work like we want it by default.
Disadvantage: the whole thing will be compiler version
dependent so we might need to have different numbers
for different compiler versions and it will be an 
area that will need constant maintenance in the future.
I'm not sure that's really a good path to walk down to.
Also cc Honza in case he has comments (you might want
to review more of the thread in the archives)
