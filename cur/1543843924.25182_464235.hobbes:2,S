just go for 'nothing' and the 5-NOP variant, and please implement 
support for it from within LTT, via a kprobe - if you want me to support 
this stuff for upstream inclusion. If we support any static tracer mode 
and LTT does not support the kprobe mode then we are back to square 1 
wrt. dependencies ...
