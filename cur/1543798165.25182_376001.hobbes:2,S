Hi friends,
can any1 point me to a good linux memory management stuff. Actually i
want to know the conversion of virtual to physical address and when u
need to do it. I am seeking to do some dma from the host memory to an
ethernet device. I have registered my own device data structures,
while booting my device. i.e it seeks all the memory it needs at
startup. later i put the data to the device specific data structures &
ring a doorbell register later upon which the device picks up the
data. This is my plan. But i am facing some problems during dma time.
So can someone throw some light as to how to do this in a generic way
so that later i can customise it?
