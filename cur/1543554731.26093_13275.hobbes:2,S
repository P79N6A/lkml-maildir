It looks like I was mistaken in my original message. I have an AMD 5x86, not
a K5.
Nevertheless, menuconfig lists the 586 option as "586/K5/5x86/6x86/6x86MX".
But, it fails to boot on my 5x86 and I have to compile for a 486 (for 2.4).
As I mentioned in my previous message, the 586/... option boots with 2.2.
I just noticed that, under both 2.2 and 2.4, uname -a identifies the
machine as an i486.
Should the 486 option be changed to "486/5x86" and the 586/... option
changed to "586/K5/6x86/6x86MX"? Or is there a bug here that needs fixing?
(IIRC, Cyrix and IBM made 5x86's as well - are those more like fast 486's
or slow Pentiums? I don't remember. If they're like Pentiums, perhaps
"486/AMD 5x86" and "586/non-AMD 5x86/6x86/6x86MX"...?)
