//Linux really needs a clean basis for asynchronous and 
//unbuffered i/o libraries.  Something like the fork/thread
//clone(), but to replace select() and aio_* polling.  This 
//might be a start. And it is just a file and very like a
//pipe or socket.
//Suppose we add /dev/qio with 64 byte sectors as follows: 
struct qio{            //64 byte i/o request
    u16 flags;          //0.0 request block variant, SEEK_SET...
    u16 verb;           //0.2 open,close,read,mmap,sync,write,
                        //    ioctl
                        //    mallocIO&read,write&freeIO,
                        //    mallocIO,freeIO
                        //    autothread might be an ioctl()
    u16 errno;          //0.4 per request status
    u16 completehow;    //0.6 queue,AST,pipe,SIGIO,SIGIO||delete ok
    u64 offset;         //1 
    u32 length;         //2.0 bytes requested
    u32 timeout;        //2.4 im ms or us?
    u32 transferred;    //3.0 bytes
    u32 qiohandle;      //3.4 for cancell or polling
    void* handle;       //4 (open & close might write)
    void* buffer;       //5
    void* callback;     //6 optimize special cases w/ completehow
    void* callparam;    //7 
};                      //all fields are read xor write
//Writing to the device would schedule i/o, reading would reap
//completions.  Bad writes would give the byte offset to the 
//rejected sector field if detected synchronously.  Multiple 
//sector writes would be truncated on the first bad sector.
//Accepted writes would be buffered in the kernel.
//Each open creates a new queue, each write is read in the
//same queue.  Any number of threads can read or write a queue.
//some cases might be simplified by kernel processed completions, 
//such as VMS AST emulation, or putting results in a pipe. Hence
//completehow, which might use callback and callparam.
//timeout?  
//canceling i/o?  
//Sun aio emulation?  
//VMS qio emulation?  
//MS IOCP emulation?
//malloc()&free() safe across threads?
//Should O_DIRECT would error unless properly aligned etc.
