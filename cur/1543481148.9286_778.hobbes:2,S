    Linux does indeed work VERY WELL with DDO from DiskMangler.  I required it
    on an old 486DX2/66 with a large hard drive installed last year sometime.

Your capitals give the impression that you are contradicting me,
i.e., that you think that Linux sometimes needs a disk manager,
or that Linux sometimes can use a disk manager.
If you think so, you are mistaken.
Something entirely different is the fact that if you use a
disk manager (presumably in order to help you out with DOS or so,
or perhaps just because you are ignorant and think that it may be
useful, or perhaps because it is useful for LILO) then Linux can
coexist with this disk manager - to be a bit more precise:
since 1.3.14 Linux can coexist with On Track Disk Manager;
since 1.3.29 Linux can coexist with EZ Drive.
Read the Large Disk HOWTO for details.
