Can you explain why you need a third scatterlist for the LRW tweak?
My understanding is that the tweak value is calculated from the disk
position of the plaintext block and and the secondary key.
It would be useful to see the original patch (which seems to be
unavailable now), with dm-crypt integration, to see how the entire
mechanism works beyond the test vectors.
