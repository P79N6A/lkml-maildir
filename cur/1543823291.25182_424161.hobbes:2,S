Not my experience. It does lots of disk I/O after resume because as you say 
yourself there is heaps in swap, but I haven't seen that I/O hurt as it 
simply stops the instant I do anything with the machine even as trivial as 
moving the mouse.

My mileage definitely varies here. I don't concentrate on examining the fact 
that the machine is doing any I/O, but how usable the machine is and it's my 
experience that it is much better as about 1/3 of my applications are not 
floundering entirely on swap. Fortunately there's a tunable there and it 
allows you to set and unset it how you see fit.
Anyway the original point of my response was to point out to Nigel that there 
is no added complexity on behalf of swsusp in the swap prefetch code.
