You always have to remember that the dependency information is used to
generate the menu structure. If you enable "Show All Options" in
xconfig, you can easily find out what's preventing a correct menu
structure. E.g. for VFAT you have two possibilities, move down the
UMSDOS_FS entry or add "depends on FAT_FS" to it.
If you want one config entry to appear as a child of another entry, it
must have at least that other entry in its dependency list.
bye, Roman
