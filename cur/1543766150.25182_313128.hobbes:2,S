Dear diary, on Thu, Apr 21, 2005 at 02:03:27PM CEST, I got a letter
where Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz> told me that...

-v is passed to rsync by default. I'll gladly add other reasonable rsync
flags (I don't call printing each considered file reasonable; fsck or
wget-like progressbar would be ideal).

No. git cancel does what it says - cancels your local changes to the
working tree. git track will only set that next time you pull from
linus, the changes will be automatically merged. (Note that this will
change with the big UI change.)
Either do
	git track linus
	git pull
or
	git merge linus
to get Linus' changes if you didn't pull yet.

If you don't have your HEAD on Linus' branch, it will do a tree merge
instead of fast-forward; that is, it will not just move your HEAD on
to match Linus' HEAD, but it will make a regular merge and then ask you
to do a merge commit.
