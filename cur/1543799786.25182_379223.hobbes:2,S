Hi all,
I'm having hard lockups with all the RCs of linux-2.6.15. I,
previously, mentioned this with the subject "[BUG]: Software compiling
occasionlly hangs under 2.6.15-rc1/rc2 and 2.6.15-rc1-mm2" in the
list. I investigated a bit at found these interesting things.
-- Always reproducable. To reproduce:
    - in console 1, issueing "updatedb"
    - in console 2, issueing "find / -name "blahblah" -print
    - in console 3, issueing "emerge -uDp world" (BTW, I'm using Gentoo.)
    - in console 4, X started.
    - a few minutes later, system completely freezes. No Alt+SysRq+t
works. (Normally, it does)
When the system freezes, there is nothing in logs. But hardly, I
captured an  Alt+SysRq+t. A few seconds (15-20 seconds) before hang. I
attached this  Alt+SysRq+t and lsmod output. Hope this helps to solve
this.
PS: These problems never occured in 2.6.14.xx and downwards.
Regards.
