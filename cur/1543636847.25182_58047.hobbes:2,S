indeed ...
fixed these, and have categorized every change whether it's safe,
known-unsafe or unknown-effect, and commented the latter two.
i also removed the save_flags() and restore_flags() macros on SMP which 
were left there by accident.
new patch is at:

(there's one more open bug, i can now see the 'exited with preempt_count
1' messages.)
