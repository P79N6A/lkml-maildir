Subject: Bug in do_mounts.c/namespace.c/devfs ?

This is clearly reproducible here.
Let's have 2.4.19-pre2-ac{2,3,maybe 4}.
Let compile in devfs support but dont enable mount on boot etc.
After boot we will have in /proc/mounts the following line
devfs /dev devfs
(other mounts)
Digging into do_mounts.c brought me to following code fragments:
                        do_devfs = 1;
                }
        }
        sys_chdir("/dev");
        sys_unlink("root");
        sys_mknod("root", S_IFBLK|0600, kdev_t_to_nr(ROOT_DEV));
        if (do_devfs)
                sys_mount("devfs", ".", "devfs", 0, NULL);
followed then by ...
done:
        putname(fs_names);
        if (do_devfs)
                sys_umount(".", 0);
I am unfamiliar with devfs and vfs code so my bug-hunting go very slowly.
Maybe somebody will point into right direction ?
The only thing I can add that in 2.4.17 all was fine.
