2.6.14-rc3-rt1 up and running for me. No problems at all building it.
I've got Jack running at <5mS and doing light streaming from 1394
drives. I'm using realtime-lsm.
The only problem I had over the last few days happened with
2.6.14-rc2-rt7. One time, when attempting to shutdown, the machine
hung after the 'Unloading Alsa modules...[OK]' step.
I'm going to be doing some composition/recording in Ardour this week.
I'll use one of these two RC kernels and see how it goes.
Cheers,
Mark
