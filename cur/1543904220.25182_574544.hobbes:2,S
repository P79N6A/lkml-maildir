It's less that struct super_block, actually.

Yes, and?  You still need one test instead of two.  Which gets you
more than 21 words used by that sucker, only in .text instead of .bss.

What?  fs/inode.c:
        if (sb->s_op->alloc_inode)
                inode = sb->s_op->alloc_inode(sb);
        else
                inode = (struct inode *) kmem_cache_alloc(inode_cachep, GFP_KERNEL);
and the same goes everywhere else.  Of course we don't check for
sb->s_op not being NULL - that's exactly why we are safe skipping such
tests.
