Good - that's all that needs doing.

No, the number does have real life meaning if the underlying
OS supports st_blocks and st_blksize. We test for the presense
of these in configure (as they're not POSIX) and send the
correct values as bytes if they are there. We (smbd) takes care
of scaling them into bytes instead of the client having to
know if it's talking to HPUX in which case it's in 8192
byte units, or to VOS etc. etc.
To recap, if we have st_blocks from the filesystem we use it
and send the value scaled as bytes, if not we send the actual
file size there in bytes (as we know any POSIX system has at
least that).
Happy ?
Jeremy.
