Good point - as I mentioned to another person, I was trying to minimize the
code changes if the feature wasn't selected.

For testing and backout - if for some odd reason you discover that it breaks
code, an 'echo 0 >' is a lot less disruptive than a full reboot.
The other reason is for distribution - if you're building a kernel for a bunch
of users, some of who disagree with it, you can ship it as the code is, and
then those who don't like one or two features can 'echo 0 >' onto those sysctls
and then 'echo 0 >' onto the one to force them read-only.  Again, less hassle
than rebuilding a kernel with one CONFIG_SECURITY_WHATEVER turned off (and then
remember to re-rebuild on those machines each time a new kernel gets rolled out
- you can just leave the sysctl's in your /etc/rc.* and be happy).
