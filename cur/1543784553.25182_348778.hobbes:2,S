What you say was true before this patch, (Although now that you point out i 
realize the ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is not required). 
Think Andi is fixing this in his next drop to -mm*
When physflat was introduced, it also  switched to use physflat mode for 
#cpus <=8 when hotplug is enabled, since it doesnt use shortcuts and 
so is also safer (although slower).

The link above made using genapic_flat safer by using the
flat_send_IPI_mask(), and hence i switched back to using
logical flat mode when #cpus <=8, since that a little more efficient than
the send_IPI_mask_sequence() used in physflat mode.
In general we need
flat_mode - #cpus <= 8 (Hotplug defined or not, so we use mask version 
                       for safety)
physflat or cluster_mode when #cpus >8.
If we choose physflat as default for #cpus <=8 (with hotplug) would make
IPI performance worse, since it would do one cpu at a time, and requires 2 
writes per cpu for each IPI v.s just 2 for a flat mode mask version of the API.
