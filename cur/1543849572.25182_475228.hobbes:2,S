I doubt it; I've tested this on 64K I-cache VIPT, 64K D-cache VIPT.

Correct.
It means no cache flush operation to deal with aliases at all left in
fork and COW code.
Another advantage of this strategy is that we will never have to handle
less virtual coherency exceptions.  A virtual coherency exception is raised
on some MIPS processors when they detect the creation of a cache alias.
This allows the software to cleanup caches.  Neat as an alarm system for
alias debugging but rather expensive to service if large numbers are
raised, not available on all processors and also detects the creation of
harmless aliases of clean lines, thus a slight annoyance.
