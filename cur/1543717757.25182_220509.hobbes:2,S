Indeed maybe returning ENOMEM from mq_send() is conforming to the
standard. Perhaps returning ENOMEM instead of ENOSPC from
mq_open() to indicate that there is unsufficient space for the creation of
a new queue isn't; I'm no longer sure.
What _is_ clear from the standard is that a queue is supposed to be
allocated on creation, even if it may not be required. Why else would
ENOSPC be explicitely listed for mq_open() when creating a new
queue, but not for mq_send()/mq_timedsend()?
What use is a message queue for a realtime application when on
mq_send() it may have to wait for memory allocation that may even
fail?
Even if POSIX allows errors to be returned that are not in the function's
ERRORS list, I don't think one should do this if it can be avoided.
