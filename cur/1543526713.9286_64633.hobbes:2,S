Subject: Question about kernel log buffer size

Is there anything wrong with upping the LOG_BUF_LEN definition in
kernel/printk.c?  I guess it makes the kernel use a little more RAM, but
my kernel generates over 20k of messages during boot before user space
can read the buffer, so if I don't raise the size, I lose messages.

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
