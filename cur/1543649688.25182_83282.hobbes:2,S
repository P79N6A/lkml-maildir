Hi,
I just experienced this problem on UP with 513M memory.  About 400m was 
locked in dentries.  The system was very unresponsive - suspect it was
spending gobs of time scaning unfreeable dentries.  This was with -mm3
up about 24 hours.
The inode caches looked sane.  Just the dentries were out of wack.
