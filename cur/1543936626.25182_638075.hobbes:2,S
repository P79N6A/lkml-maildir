FYI, I added the following vectors:
	# kernel services that need to override task security
	class kernel_service
	{
		use_as_override
		create_files_as
	}
The first allows:
	avc_has_perm(daemon_tsec->sid, nominated_sid,
		     SECCLASS_KERNEL_SERVICE,
		     KERNEL_SERVICE__USE_AS_OVERRIDE,
		     NULL);
And the second something like:
	avc_has_perm(tsec->sid, inode->sid,
		     SECCLASS_KERNEL_SERVICE,
		     KERNEL_SERVICE__CREATE_FILES_AS,
		     NULL);
Rather than specifically dedicating them to the cache, I made them general.
