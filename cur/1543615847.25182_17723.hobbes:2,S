Subject: CONFIG_HIMEM instability?

I recently upgraded my machine to 1GB so I had to switch on the 
CONFIG_HIGHMEM setting.  Ever since although the kernel has been OK 
userspace apps have started dropping out for no apparent reason 
(gkrellm, for example, crashes about every 10 minutes).
What does CONFIG_HIGHMEM actually modify that could affect userspace?  I 
was under the impression it just moved the kernel structures higher up 
in the memory space.
Unfortunately memtest86 is incompatible with this mobo, but the memory 
checks out on another machine I tried it on, so I expect it's OK.
