I consider them to be the same relationship between directories and files.
A/tasks are siblings of A/a1 and A/other children, *but* the entities of
interest are A and A/a1.

I propose that it gets 1/2 of the bandwidth, here is why
1. Assume that a task in A/tasks forks 1000 children, what happens to the
bandwidth of A/a1's tasks then? We have no control over how many tasks can be
created on A/tasks as a consequence of moving one task to A/tasks. Doing it the
other way would mean, that A/a1/tasks will get 1/1001 of the bandwidth (sounds
very unfair and prone to Denial of Service/Fairness)

It should reflect the accumulated usage of A's children and the tasks in A.

I think the concept makes sense, but creating a default child is going to be
confusing, as it is not really a child of A.

Which means we'll need special logic in the cgroup filesystem to handle
def_child. Not a very good idea.
