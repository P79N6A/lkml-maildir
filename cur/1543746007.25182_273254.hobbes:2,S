Hello!
I am running 2.4.10-rc2 and I have now gotten two instances of the above
oops.  I haven't managed to record the oops message for it as of yet.  I
am connecting to the internet over ppp.  IIRC, it has appeared both times
after ssh-ing to my email provider and running pine.  I'm not sure if this
had anything to do with it or not.  I rembmer that there are some do_IRQ
and do_softirq stuff in the traceback, along with something like a line of
========='s....  This is with a non tainted kernel, compiled with GCC 3.4
with PREEMPT turned on...
I can try to collect more information if it is desired....I am not on the
list, so please CC me with any replies...
TIA
Erik
