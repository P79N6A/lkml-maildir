While I haven't looked at the G77 front end, I would be surprised if it used a
heap (there are architectures out there where the stack is allocated from the
heap as well, but these are rare for the C/C++ family of languages).  I can say
the way the GCC back end does scoped procedures is by passing the address of
the lexically enclosing function in a hidden register, and if the language
allows taking the address of a function, it usually involves a trampoline (on
some architectures and ABI's it doesn't, since function pointers are already
'FAT' -- for example, under the AIX/Mac environment, a function pointer
actually points to a 3 word quantity that contains the actual function pointer,
the GOT address to load up into r2, and the static chain to be loaded up into
r11).
