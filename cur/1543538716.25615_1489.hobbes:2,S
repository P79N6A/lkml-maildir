On the other hand there is a lot of keyboards but very many of them have
the same buttons. There are usually buttons for starting programs,
controling a cd-player and some web stuff. It would be easier if at least
all keyboards with the same sort of keys where mapped to the same
keycodes.
A big part of the kernel is about making different hardware
look the same to the programs. Most of the keyboard you see in stores
today have a lot of extra buttons. To me that suggest that we should have
a number of standard keycodes for normal stuff that exists on a lot of the
hardware (like extra LEDs on keyboards).
So you suggest I make another program that starts up the keyboard. If it's
not in the kernel then how do I know that my program does not interfer
with the kernel. Of course I can just send the codes to port 0x60 but that
seems brutal.
