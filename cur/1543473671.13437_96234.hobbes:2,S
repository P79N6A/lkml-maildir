With 2.2.0pre1-ac2 I've had on occasion DMA problems with the sound driver,
giving me
Sound error: Couldn't allocate DMA buffer
errors.  These don't really happen all that often; they seem to happen just
on occasion.  After I get one of those, they don't stop until I unload
the OSS kernel modules and reload them.
Few specs on my system for debugging purposes:
AWE64 Gold sound card (PnP)
module list:
awe_wave              157644   1
opl3                   10984   1
sb                     28424   1
uart401                 5968   1  [sb]
sound                  57560   0  [awe_wave opl3 sb uart401]
soundlow                 300   0  [sound]
soundcore               2116   7  [sb sound]
The system has 32MB EDO RAM, and is a Pentium 166 MMX with PIIX4
(430TX chipset I think)
I have one floppy disk drive but I don't recall using it since I last
booted--however earlier when I had this DMA problem, mounting a floppy disk
caused it to "fallback on virtual DMA".
Hopefully this is a known problem, but if anybody would like me to do some
tests on my system I'd be glad to :)
