Subject: [PATCH] i2c.h: Fix another gcc 4.0 compile failure
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Mickey Stein
  Versions:   linux-2.6.11-rc4-bk7, gcc4 (GCC) 4.0.0 20050217 (latest fc 
rawhide from 19Feb DL)
  gcc4 cvs seems to dislike "include/linux/i2c.h file":
  Error msg:   include/linux/i2c.h:{55,194} error: array type has 
incomplete element type
 
  A. Daplas has recently done a workaround for this on another header 
file. A thread discussing this
  can be found by following the link below:
 
  
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2005-02/msg00053.html
 
  The patch changes the array declaration from "struct x y[]" format to 
"struct x *y".
  I realize its only a workaround, but the gcc guys seem to be aware of 
this.
  ** Note: I'm a noob at this, so feel free to make chopped liver out of 
this if its incorrect.
  patch below is also attached since I'm not sure formatting survives 
the cut&paste.
