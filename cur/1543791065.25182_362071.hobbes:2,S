I'm guessing the driver isn't properly unregistering itself from 
wherever it is it has registered with (block/character device). Anything 
where the driver is registering function pointers, references, etc. to 
itself needs to be cleaned up on module removal.
The oops stacktrace may point to what it is that has been left behind..
