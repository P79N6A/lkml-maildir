What about adding an u32 flags field to each one of the new futex 
sys_calls. This gives you more freedom for future extensions without
changing the API again. Possible uses may be:
- Specify the futexes to be mm-local: By using the pair mm* and vaddr as
   key it is possible to have process local futexes living on the same
   hash with the following advantages:
   1. no page_table lock contention (I implemented mm-local futexes
      for my application after I noticed long latencies on SMP where a
      high prio tasks spun in futex_wake while another task was doing 		
      mmap/munmap on a second processor).
   2. no vcache pollution (I guess 99% of all futexes will not be in 		 
     shared memory)
   3. Slightly faster, since no page pinning is needed
- Specify queueing or unqueueing in priority order

P.S.
By the way, your latest futex patch still contains the bogus
if (!list_empty(&q.list)) conditional, that's always true since
you hold the locks at this point and no one can have removed us
from the list:

Of course the test would be (and was) pretty necessary if you drop the
locks before the get_user(...) call. And I must admit that I still
can't see why you need to hold the locks across get_user. Even if it's
save to do so at least every automatic code checker will bark at this point.
