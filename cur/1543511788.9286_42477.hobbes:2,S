Names _are_ policy. So now I have to hack the kernel to rename the mouse?

There is an even thinner layer that does that, called mknod(8)+chmod(1)...

Neither is any "dynamic" name assignment, where names are compiled into the
kernel (see above). As none of the alternatives (devfs and increased dev_t)
really solves this problem, which clearly is the central point of the
exercise anyway, we have to look for something else.

It is a complex mechanism to buy exactly what we had before. Violates KISS.

This has security implications... if I can somehow mount devfs with _my_
machinery to handle permissions (needed for "random user plugs in USB
floppy", perhaps), the system is screwed. Again, goes against KISS.

Not proven, AFAIKS.

What is needed is a way to address _data_, not _devices_. A user cares
about the document she is writing, not about "USB SCSI controller 2, device
14, partition 6, inode 417". The Unix way of handling files solves this for
_fixed_ devices. For _removable_ devices (or media), I know of no real
solution.  Throw in the possibility of getting at data over FTP, HTTP, NFS,
and whatnot (ultimate removability ;-).
As I see it, the problem(s) to be solved are much, much wider than just
device naming.
