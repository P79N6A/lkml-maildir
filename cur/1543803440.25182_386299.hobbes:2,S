Subject: [PATCH 0/8] sh updates

This includes some various updates for sh. Including a new clock and
timer API, DMA updates, overhauling some of the I/O routines to allow for
further board cleanup, as well as shuffling some code around for reuse on
some new CPU subtypes.
Pretty much all of the changes are isolated to arch/sh and include/asm-sh.
