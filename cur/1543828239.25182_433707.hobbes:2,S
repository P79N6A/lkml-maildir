Thanks for notifying us about this Arjan. I've checked in RHEL patches
and found that this is done in 2.4.21-binfmt-elf.patch with a detailed
explanation. The patch is rather large, not to say invasive. I believe
it serves other purposes but it seems to me that it will still be
invasive enough not to be merged into 2.4 mainline right now.
