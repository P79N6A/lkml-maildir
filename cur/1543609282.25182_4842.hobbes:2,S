Well, obviously your drive or mobo doesn't support DMA. I noticed that all the
other devices (hd[acd]) were in PIO mode, why not try setting dma mode on one of
them. Most CD's I've come across don't do DMA very well, I believe that the DMA
is mostly only useful for DVD's, where you need a high transfer rate to watch a
movie.
