Thanks. I used to call radeonfb_ exposed routines to the outside world
and radeon_ internal ones, but your fix is probably the simplest way to
get out of the conflict with DRI indeed.
What kind of grabage do you get ? Can you re-enable DEBUG in radeonfb.h
and send me a dmesg log after boot ? Did the "old" radeonfb work
properly ? Also, what is the native resolution of your flat panel ?
Ben.
