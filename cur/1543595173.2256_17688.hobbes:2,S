There's a really simple solution to that.  Eric can just make up his own help 
file entries that are wildly inaccurate and actively insulting to whoever it 
is who owns the symbol.  Something along the lines of:
"Enabling this subsystem may cause your house to burn down and your dog to 
explode.  The prevailing opinion is that Linus was probably blackmailed into 
including this option by someone with naked pictures of his cat.  It's 
useless and irritating, and just might be removed soon, so don't count on it 
continuing to be there.  Nobody knows how to use it because they didn't 
provide any documentation for it."
Then they're welcome to ignore it. :)
