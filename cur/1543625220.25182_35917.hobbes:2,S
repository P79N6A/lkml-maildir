Actually, no on DASD. DASD = "Direct Access Storage Device" and while disk
is the most common implementation of that, it is not the only. Like
Windows is the most common implementation of "operating system," but not
the only one, thankfully.
Think drum, solid state storage, optical, etc... all DASD.
