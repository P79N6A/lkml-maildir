The only way it could be invoked is via SAK, which obviously isn't
happening here.
However, login _does_ call sys_vhangup() which in turn calls tty_vhangup()
so I suspect that the statement "tty hangup is scheduled for work_queue"
is based on the _assumption_ that sys_vhangup() calls tty_hangup()
rather than the function it actually does.
