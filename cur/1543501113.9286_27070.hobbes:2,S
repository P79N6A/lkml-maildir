I think the only serious weakness of the plain old directory is the one
NextStep has - lack of discipline. Anyone can put irrelevant files in the
document directory, and make a mess. A slight modification of the file
system, so that only component files for the document can be
created/modified/deleted in the document directory, sounds a good idea to me.
I think the difficulty could be devising a solution that imposes such
discipline, but still lets the directory be tar'ed, untar'ed, and so on for
easy transmission.
