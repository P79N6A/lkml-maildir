Hrm... The interesting thing with this scheme is that it allows
you to first block your queue, then let other driver do the same
while your async IO completes, and then come back. Well... this
could be an option to step "2" of my earlier proposal.
This requires the device structure to keep track of which driver
still wants to be called. It would only go to step 3 once all
drivers have ack'ed step 2.
Ben.
