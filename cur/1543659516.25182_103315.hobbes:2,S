I added the following to the top of the document.  Do you have any
other comments on the document or this text?
The Intelligent Peripheral Management Interface, or IPMI, is a
standard for controlling intelligent devices that monitor a system.
It provides for dynamic discovery of sensors in the system and the
ability to monitor the sensors and be informed when the sensor's
values change or go outside certain boundaries.  It also has a
standardized database for field-replacable units (FRUs) and a watchdog
timer.
To use this, you need an interface to an IPMI controller in your
system (called a Baseboard Management Controller, or BMC) and
management software that can use the IPMI system.
