And this has been demonstrated mathematically/algorithmically to be
true 100% of the time, regardless of the load and the driver set? IOW,
if I was building an automated industrial saw (based on a VP+IRQ-thread
kernel or a combination of the above-mentioned agregate) with a
safety mechanism that depended on the kernel's responsivness to
outside events to avoid bodily harm, would you be willing to put your
hand beneath it?
How about things like a hard-rt deterministic nanosleep() 100% of the
time with RTAI/fusion?
