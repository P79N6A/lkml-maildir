     smitty, the terminal-based version of AIX's system management tool,
uses dashes (0x2d), pipes (0x7c), and plus signs (0x2b), like this:
     +----------------------------------------+
     | Press ENTER to continue or PF3 to exit |
     +----------------------------------------+
     Equal signs (0x3d) might be used instead:
     +========================================+
     | Press ENTER to continue or PF3 to exit |
     +========================================+
     I have seen other programs attempt to use the box-drawing
characters instead, with mixed results.  They're nice glyphs if you
can get 'em [and you can get 'em if you try] but if you incorrectly
assume you have them the results can be terrible.  You can always
query the current locale to try to determine whether the box-drawing
characters are supported.
