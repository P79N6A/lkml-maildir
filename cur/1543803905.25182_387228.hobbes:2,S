RAID resize/restripe may not be so common with cheap / PC-based RAID
systems, but it is common with midrange and enterprise storage
subsystems from vendors such as EMC, HDS, IBM & HP.
in fact, I'd say it's the exception to the rule _if_ an
midrange/enterprise storage subsystem doesn't have an _online_ resize
capability..
personally, I think this this useful functionality, but my personal
preference is that this would be in DM/LVM2 rather than MD.  but given
Neil is the MD author/maintainer, I can see why he'd prefer to do it in
MD. :)
cheers,
lincoln.
