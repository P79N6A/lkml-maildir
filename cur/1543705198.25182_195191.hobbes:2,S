First of all, congratulations to everyone contributing to swsusp, great
work! Runs fast and stable here with 2.4.24, surely something I wouldn't
want to miss on my Laptop. Suspending takes about 15 sec, resuming about
half a minute. No problems with drivers, no unloading of modules is
necessary. Also bootsplash does look very 'sexy' with swsusp. 
Secondly, and 'somewhat offtopic': How the heck do I get rid of this
ditty stuck in my head? ;-)
