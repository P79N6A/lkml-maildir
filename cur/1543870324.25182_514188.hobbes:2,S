this one in evserver_kevent.c looks problematic too:
        shutdown(s, SHUT_RDWR);
        close(s);
as evserver_epoll.c only does:
        close(s);
again, there might be TCP control flow differences due to this. [ Or the 
removal of this shutdown() call might be a small speedup for the kevent 
case ;) ]
Also, the order of fd and socket close() is different in the two cases. 
It shouldnt make any difference - but that too just makes the results 
harder to trust. Would it be so hard to introduce a single 
handle_web_request() function that is exactly the same in the two tests? 
All the queueing details (which are of course different in the epoll and 
the kevent case) should be in the client function, which calls 
handle_web_request().
