Hi,
Linux waits on 'wait queues' but other UNIXes sleep on 'channels'.
What is better with wait queues?
Note that an array of wait queues, some hash function for the channel,
some channel field in the task structure and some spin_lock should be
enough to implement the tsleep()/wakeup() semantic and get rid of all the
wait queues (excepted, obviously, the ones used to implement the
tsleep()/wakeup() semantic). 
Hmmm ... Indeed this should not be enough, but perhaps close to be so. ;-)
Gérard.
