If all architectures would finally get a vdso implementation you could
just add the necessary stub in the vdso, add a symbol in the symbol
table of the vdso, and use in the userlevel code
  sym = dlsym (RTLD_DEFAULT, "the_symbol_name")
If the returned value is not NULL the symbol exists.
I've described this many times as one of the huge advantages of vdsos,
hopefully this time it clicks.
