Imho, this is not right. This change the meaning of CPU_DEAD, and so
we should fix all users of CPU_DEAD as well.
How about
	CPU_DEAD_WHATEVER
		the processes are still frozen
	CPU_DEAD
		after we thaw_processes
This way we can add processing of the new CPU_DEAD_WHATEVER event where
it may help. We don't need to change (for example) workqueue.c with this
patch, we can do it in a separate patch.
CPU_UP_PREPARE is called after freeze_processes()... Probably this works,
but imho this is no good. Suppose for a moment that khelper will be frozen
(yes, yes it can't be), then we can't do kthread_create().
Oleg.
