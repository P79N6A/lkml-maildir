Subject: [patch] trivial change in kernel/sched.c in 2.6.0-test9+
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/11/26/2

this ends up saving a few math operations any time a child
process exits. ( calling sched_exit(task_t * p) )
here's my exact comment on the contents of the patch (left
out of the actual patch)
    /*
     * the funcion below was origionally this, for anyone
     * wondering what I changed.  I mearly used some algebra
     * to factor out a 1 / (EXIT_WEIGHT + 1)
     *
     *      p->parent->sleep_avg = p->parent->sleep_avg /
     *      (EXIT_WEIGHT + 1) * EXIT_WEIGHT + p->sleep_avg /
     *      (EXIT_WEIGHT + 1);
     *
     * the only possible effects I see this having are:
     *
     *    1. less math operations for each child process exiting
     *    2. higher accuracy in the value of p->parent->sleep_avg
     *       due to using only 1 division over 2
     *
     */
patches clean(a little offset, but no fuzz) on test9, test9-mms, 
test10, test10-mm1
