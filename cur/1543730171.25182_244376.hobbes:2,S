The attached patch might work. It changes the IP source address from
192.168.1.1 to 192.168.77.1 and then recalculates the IP header
checksum. (I haven't tested it, though).
Do I understand you correctly that the IP checksum is calculated
correctly, but for the address 192.168.1.1, and the UDP and TCP
checksums are computed as if the address was 192.168.77.1?  If so, I
think this should work...
Now, can you please oblige us with the name of the manufacturers of the
broken router (as someone else also previously requested), so they can
be properly publicly ridiculed?  :-)
Hope it helps,
Dave
