He is is probably referring to "chattr +S".  See the man page for
chattr for more information.  Note that strictly speaking this does
not necessarily give you "atomic changes".  It does mean that changes
are scheduled to be immediately written to disk, but that does not
guarantee atomicity, at least not for all filesystems and for all
operations.  You *can* be guaranteed that system calls will not return
until the changes are on disk; note though that this does have has
some significant performance impacts.
