The "at least on the i386 arch" part is the key caveat.  On PPC AFAIK,
PIO is remapped and treated very similarly to MMIO.  ioremap on x86, for
PIO, could probably be a no-op, simply returning the same address it was
given.  For other arches which want to do more complex mappings, ioremap
is IMHO the perfect part of the API for the job.
Basically I don't understand the following train of thought:
* We needed to remap MMIO, therefore ioremap was created.
* Now, we need to remap PIO too [on some arches].  Let's hide the
remapping in arch-specific code.
That's an understandable train of thought from an
implement-it-now-in-2.4 standpoint, but not from a
2.5-design-something-better standpoint.
