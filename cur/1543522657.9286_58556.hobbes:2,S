Hello , 
i have a couple of different revisions of intel ethet express pro 10/100 and
they all behave on 2.3.39
(i think the last one i tired was 2.3.18 and everything was fine) 
i keep getting :
Jan 18 21:54:56 dumbo kernel: eth0: Trying to restart the transmitter... 
Jan 19 08:48:38 dumbo kernel: eth0: Trying to restart the transmitter... 
Obviously the link goes down and sometimes comes back sometimes i have to
ping from the console to wake it up. 
Is this a known issue or not , and if it is how do i get around it ( other
than changing cards ) ? 
thanks ,
