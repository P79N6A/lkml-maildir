Hmm. Looking at the commit that broke, the "strstr()" was there 
originally, so in that sense your patch is obviously the minimal and safe 
one. So I'll apply it as-is after all, but I'd be even happier if somebody 
cleaned this up a bit and sent a patch after I do 2.6.19 (which may well 
be later today, I think the time has come).
