Thank you Marko.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  And thank you very much Omar Kilani for the retrofit.  But kernel doesn't recognize the adapter.
Installed the patch, compiled, installed, & everything seemed to go fine.  Booted to IDE... no problems, except the DPT HA wasn't recognized.  There was no mention of the DPT in messages, either recognized as hardware, nor to load the driver.
I am running an MSI KT7Turbo mobo with Athlon 850.  Six PCI & no IDE.  DPT PM3755F fibrechannel host adapter is in the first slot & has two Cheetahs attached.  Outfit works fine in Winders2k.  Trying to move to kernel 2.4.2, in RedHat Wolverine.
Please help.
