As a "make menuconfig" user, let me say that I agree. Of course, I'm used
to rebuild kernel, but sometimes, some options are not clear, and the help
text is searched for. But, getting too much of "No help text available"
usually results in people no more reading the help text.
What about splitting the screen to have the top half with the menu, and the
bottom half with the help ?
