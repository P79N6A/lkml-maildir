For purely academic interest, and to satisfy my own curiosity, I have
pulled the two processors out of the box to examine their markings.
Here they are:
Processor 1
-----------
| AHX1200AMS3C == Athlon MP 1200MHz (0.18um), CPGA package, 1.75V, 95'C
max temp, 256K L2 cache, 266MHz max bus speed.
| AGKGA 0137MPMW
Athlon XP Palomino core, manufactured 37th week of the year 2001.
Processor 2
-----------
| AHX1200AMS3C == Athlon MP 1200MHz (0.18um), CPGA package, 1.75V, 95'C
max temp, 256K L2 cache, 266MHz max bus speed.
| AGHCA 0129CPAW
Unknown core, manufactured 29th week of the year 2001.
So although they look identical, have the same model number and were
produced only 8 weeks apart, they really do have a different stepping
(and core) identifier. I couldn't find what the AGHCA corresponded to.
