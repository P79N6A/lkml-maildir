I don't think so. The only overdrive that fitted in a socket 8 board
was a PPro->PentiumII thing, which would be model 3 stepping 2 as far
as I can figure out from a lengthy archeology trip through developer.intel.com.
There were also some Socket8->Socket370 convertors, but afaik they just passed
through the family/model/stepping of whatever was plugged into them.
