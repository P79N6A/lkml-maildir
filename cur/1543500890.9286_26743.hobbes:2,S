I am trying to collect as much info as I can on Linux framebuffers on my
video page:  
http://havoc.gtf.org/garzik/video/
The framebuffer drivers do not currently have a standard set of mode
options -- but this is changing in 2.3.x as there is a small list of
standard modes that will be supported across almost all drivers.
For the Permedia2 driver, it has a home page, which includes
documentation of the kernel options: 
http://www.cs.unibo.it/~nardinoc/pm2fb/
For the ATI driver (atyfb) you are unfortunately out of luck; the source
code is the only documentation there is.  Look at the atyfb_setup()
function, that is the one that parses the options.  Scanning the source
code, the available options seem to be:
	font:{font name}
	noblink
	noaccel
	vram:{number}
	pll:{number}
	vmode:{number}
	cmode:{number} - looks like bpp.  valid values: 0, 8, 15, 16, 24, 32

Yeah, 'make config' doesn't have this problem either.  I have been too
lazy too look into it since I rarely use xconfig.  ;-)
