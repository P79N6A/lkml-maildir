I was speaking about a disk, whose "additional space" appeared to 
be already exhausted.  After that, it appears as if the native
size remains still constant, and the exceeding damaged sectors are 
auto-"hidden" by the drive by means of HPA.
Still incorrect?
Then I'm also speaking about not-broken disks, where I just want
to be able to tell the driver to believe the drive's "HPA-lie"
for whatever reason :-)
