the removal of FASTCALL is fine: the default (and only) compiler model 
for x86 (32-bit) is regparm(3), so the regparm(3) macro is equivalent to 
the empty one in linux/linkage.h.
btw., removal of FASTCALL from the tree is worthwile after this: it 
should probably be done via the -mm tree, because it's more of a generic 
kernel matter than an arch/x86 matter.
