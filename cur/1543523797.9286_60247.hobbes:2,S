This is a patch against the top-level Makefile in Linux 2.3.40.  It will
use a file called .arch to decide which architecture to build for.  If
no .arch file exists, it will be created.
Why do I want this?  Because I often build for an architecture which is
not the native one.  Saving the architecture in .arch is more convenient
then typing "make ARCH=foo".
Is is possible that Linus would accept this?
