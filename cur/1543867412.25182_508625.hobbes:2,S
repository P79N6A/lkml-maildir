Which is irrelevant since the hardware drivers won't be used in a
virtualised environment with any kind of performance optimisation.

paravirt_ops has no business fiddling with udelay. Not only does it
create more code bloat and stalls in relatively fast paths but its
optimising the wrong thing anyway.
My performance sucks -> optimise out udelay is the wrong approach. My
performance sucks, switch to the virtual block driver is the right
approach, and a virtual block driver won't be using udelay anyway
