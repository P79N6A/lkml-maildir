Never mind: I just looked closer into the patch - magic - mpc_oem_check()
does just this! 
I apologize for missing this on the first read. Was in a hurry to get to
Christmas shopping :-)
I have to say that the mechanism developed in the patch looks perfect for
ES7000 case. 
I just need to catch up and digest it ASAP so I won't go again down the road
you already went...

Maybe, for other systems MANY_CPU criteria would make sense, but it won't
work for us: on ES7000s with Fosters/Gallatins, we can run 1 to 32 CPUs and
have to be in flat clustered mode in any case - whether we run 2 do 32 of
them... This is also true for Cascades running on hierarchical cluster
(logical). Our APIC ID's are hard-coded topologically in the BIOS, so we
could run 2 processors on the high end of topology, with high APIC IDs. We
couldn't get around using just ID's (not the EID's), because hardware needs
the full CPU ID address to deliver IPIs.
