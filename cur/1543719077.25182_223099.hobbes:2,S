In a way, you are right.  nVidia was and is a walking timebomb and
making bugs more likely to happen is a good thing in general.  Except
that this bug can eat filesystems, so making it more likely will cause
more filesystems to be eaten.
Anyway, whether we go for 4k in 2.6 or not, we should do our best to
fix bad code and I will go looking for some more so others can go and
fix some more.  There's still enough horror in mainline for more than
one amusement park, we just haven't found it yet.
