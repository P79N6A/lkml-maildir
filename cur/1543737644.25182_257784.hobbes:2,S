	It might be not umount, actually - if you get double mount for any
reason, the first umount -l will strip the top layer, leaving whatever's
beneath it.
	Could you add printk to sys_mount() and sys_umount(), so that
we could at least see which one is a problem?  Just "called mount"/"called
umount", nothing fancy with arguments...
