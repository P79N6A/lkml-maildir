A gzipped tar file containing the patch series (against 2.6.17-rc5-mm3) 
in a form suitable for use with quilt is now available at:
<
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/plugsched-6.3.2-for-2.6.17-rc5-mm3.series.tar.gz?download>
It's still a bit light in the description area but I figured that it's 
better than nothing.  Hopefully, the patch names give some idea of their 
purpose.
