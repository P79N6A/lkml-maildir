Subject: kernel panic with 2.4.16 and blockhighmem patch

I'm getting a kernel panic when running specSFS on a 4x700PIII xeon highmem
system with 4GB RAM.  We connect to our storage with a qlogicfc card and
have dual Gig Nics to the network.  The filesystem is xfs.
The final message is:
scsi_free:Bad offset
In interrupt handler - not syncing
I complete the test fine with vanilla 2.4.16, and am wondering if this has
been seen elsewhere.  Any ideas what would be causing this or, how I should
fix it, would be appreciated.
