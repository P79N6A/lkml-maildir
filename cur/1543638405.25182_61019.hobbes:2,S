Alan,
2.4.19-rc5-ac1 hangs on boot on my laptop (Fujitsu P-series, TM5800
CPU), whereas plain[1] rc5 boots fine.  The hang appears to be during IDE
detection:
...
block: 704 slots per queue, batch=176
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=XX
ALI15X3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 78
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:0f.0. Please try using pci=biosirq
ALI15X3: chipset revision 195
ALI15X3: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
With rc5, I get this same error unless I have 'ide0=ata66 ide1=ata66'
on the kernel command line.  However, -ac1 hangs with or without these
options.
I had this same problem under rc3-ac1, and rc2-ac2 (last two -ac
kernels I tried), so this looks to be a long-term problem.  I'm hoping
maybe I can help debug it before it gets into Marcelo's tree.

commit interval to 30 seconds.
