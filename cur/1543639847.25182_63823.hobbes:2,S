I didn't use brlocks in the initial code because I wanted the lock
in the same cacheline as the data it's locking.
And this code removes the locking altogether.
I suspect the lock traffic is in the noise compared with all the
get_bh, brelse, set_bit and clear_bit operations but it's a start.
We don't have a tool to measure those other things ;)
