2.4.5-ac1 crashed on my machine, vanilla 2.4.5 worked but slower than 2.4.2
2.4.5-ac2 is _a lot_ faster than all the 2.4.4 and of vanilla 2.4.5
please notice that I have a 4G machine, dual proc, and I run a very
memory/IO/CPU intensive test, so your mileage may vary with different
applications.
I have no swapping in my case, it is the filesystem cache that works better in
my case. In the 2.4.4-ac series the machine would slowdown by a good 5-10%
(fluctuating) when the filesystem cache would hit the size of the physical RAM.
I have observed the same behaviour on three different brands (HP, Dell and
Compaq), I don't think that it depends on a specific chipset.
