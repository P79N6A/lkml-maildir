That's a good point.  Furthermore, any decent suspend script will flush
all dirty buffers to disk before suspending anything.

Unfortunately a lot of hardware doesn't support USB low-power mode.  I 
guess you'd say therefore it doesn't really support hardware-suspend.  
This may be so, but it's small comfort to the owners of those systems.
I have to admit, although technically Phillip's argument is wrong, from a
useability standpoint it is right.  Windows allows users to disconnect and
reconnect USB storage devices while the system is hibernating, with no
apparent ill effects -- although I've never tried to unplug one device and
then plug in a different one on the same port while the computer was
asleep.  I don't know to what extent Windows checks descriptors/serial 
numbers/disk labels/whatever when it wakes up.
