Two things:
1)  O_NONE, etc.  Why not?  It's symmetrical, useful, even elegant.
2) Eliminating chmod() & friends.  Why?  All you'll be doing is insuring
   that programs that are secure on, say, FreeBSD or Solaris, have
   dangerous security issues on Linux (open/f*/close introduces
   potential races as well as eliminating others), and vice-versa.
   Not a good idea.
