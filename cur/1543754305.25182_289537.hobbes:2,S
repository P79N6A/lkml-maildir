It provides the DVD_AUTH ioctls to handle this. Why are you banging raw
commands at hardware when there is an abstraction for it ?
Someone did actually have a demo of a small fs that allowed you to
fiddle with the status but possibly the code could get smarter for
"exclusive user of media". I'm not sure if that is worth it.
