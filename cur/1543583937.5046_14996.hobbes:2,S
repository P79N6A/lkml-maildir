	More generally -- if I want to know if a DVD has been inserted and of what type
and/or a floppy has been inserted or a removable media of type "X" or perhaps
more generally -- not just if a 'device' has changed but a file or directory?
	I think that is what famd is supposed to do, but apparently it does so (I'm 
guessing from the external description) by polling and says it needs kernel support
to be more efficient.  Famd was apparently ported to Linux from Irix where it had
the kernel ability to be notified of changed file-space items (file-space = anything
accessible w/a pathname).
	Now if I can just remember where I saw this mythical port of the 'file-access
monitoring daemon'....
