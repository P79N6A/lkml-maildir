For I/O ports, which have values between 0x0000 and 0xFFFF, you use
inb/inw/inl and outb/outw/outl, and do not use ioremap.
For ISA and PCI memory regions (which are completely different from I/O
ports), you always use ioremap, and talk to the regions use
readb/readw/readl and writeb/writew/writel.
There exist isa_xxx functions but do not use these:  these are only for
outdated drivers which have not yet been converted to use ioremap.
