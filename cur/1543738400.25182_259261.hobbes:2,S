I am actually in agreement with you, favoring this soft real-time
approach, but this is not bounded response time or determinism.  There
are no guarantees, no measurements conducted with all possible inputs,
sizes, errors, and so on.  This soft real-time approach gives great
average case--but the worst case is only a measurement on a specific
machine in a specific workload.
