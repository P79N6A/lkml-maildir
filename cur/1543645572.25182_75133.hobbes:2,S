With the last patch I just sent to Linus, I think you have everything
you need (from the driver core, exported to /sbin/hotplug.)  Let me know
if there's any changes that can help you out.
I'll work on adding /sbin/hotplug support for classes later this week,
but I don't think your code would need that, correct?
thanks,
