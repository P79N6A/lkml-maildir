You should also check this with your BIOS.  It will be a bit unfortunate 
if BIOS decides to just throw away 0.5GB of your memory to make space
for PCI devices, and maybe you can help BIOS a bit with right
shuffling (with 3:1 it will hopefully decide to put 1GB above
4GB boundary; with 2:2 who knows; AFAIK Opteron northbridge does not
allow for splitting DRAM on one node into two regions; at least I did not 
found how to do that).
I would prefer 2:2 if both variants give you same amount of accessible
memory.
