It depends on what you are using STD for.  ;-)
It might be a bit off-topic for this thread, but I'm using STD for 
turning my PC off in the evening and getting it back in exactly the same 
state in the morning.
This might not have been the original purpose of suspend, but it works 
quite well, STR is obviously not an alternative, and it doesn't matter 
much whether it takes a minute.
