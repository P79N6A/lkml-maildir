I'm just basing this on the history of the patch, which preceeds me, so
if this is incorrect, please don't blame me for misinformation :)
The original patch claims that hyper-threading opens the user up to some
sort of security risk involving hardware limitations in protecting
memory across the threads. I can't recall all the details.
If this is wrong, I'm more than happy to just drop the whole damn patch.
