Is it possible and what would be the objections against having a ctime or
mtime that corresponds with the start-time of that process ?
As i see it, all these entries in the proc-filesystem don't use the
ctime or mtime, so it could be useful for something like that.
For instance, entries that were created by a module could have a creation
time that corresponds with the time when that module has been loaded.
It would be nice for instance to do ls -t in /proc and have a chronologic
list of processes.
Thanks in advance,
