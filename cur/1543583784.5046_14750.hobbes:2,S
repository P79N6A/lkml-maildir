Subject: PATCH: kernel/sched.c - Optimisation of some variable assignments
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I was reading through sched.c and noticed two places where variable
assignments occur immediately prior to 'if(test) goto label:' statements.
If the test is TRUE, then the jump happens and in both cases the
variables are either not used, or immediately over-written..
So I've re-sequenced the two sets of statements to 'test then assign'
rather than 'assign regardless, then test'.
I presume that the C compiler is optimising this out, but not all 
platforms may been seeing this... It's probably only going to save
a couple of cycles on any iteration through the scheduler, but
the more available for everyone else the better :)
