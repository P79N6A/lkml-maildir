We'll have to know the video card before anyone will be able to comment
on that with much help, I suspect.
I can't really help, but the TGA framebuffer on this Multia scrolls back
instantly and so does the Matroxfb on my G200 on my mainbox does the same.
So it might be something with the vesafb.
You might want to try the ypan or ywrap option and see if that helps much.
I'd almost suspect a limitation in your VGA Bios's VESA implementation if
that doesn't do the trick.
