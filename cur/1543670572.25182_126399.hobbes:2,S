I guess the question is: is there any point to have three forms --
with necessary conversions between them -- or is it simpler to have
two forms and just use the more awkward dev_t form everywhere?  The
only use for dev_t's in the kernel should be getting them from or
shipping them off to userspace at some point, so it might be just as
easily to do the conversion directly -- macroized, of course.
We do need a dev32_t for NFSv2 et al, though.
