This can be costly, but if you flush the IOMMU like sparc64 does (basically
it's similar to how KMAPs are flushed on x86), the cost gets real low because
then you only flush the whole iommu once every time you walk the whole mapping
table of the iommu.
I'm sure you've probably thought of this already, just mentioning it in case
you haven't.
