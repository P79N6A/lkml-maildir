Hi!
2.6.12-rc5 (and newer) does not boot on sharp zaurus sl-5500. It
blinks with green led, fast; what does it mean? I'd like to verify if
it at least reaches .c code in setup.c. I inserted this code at
begining of setup.c:674...
#define locomo_writel(val,addr) ({ *(volatile u16 *)(addr) = (val); })
#define LOCOMO_LPT_TOFH         0x80
#define LOCOMO_LED              0xe8
#define LOCOMO_LPT0             0x00
      locomo_writel(LOCOMO_LPT_TOFH, LOCOMO_LPT0 + LOCOMO_LED);
...but that does not seem to do a trick -- it only breaks the boot :-(
(do I need to add some kind of IO_BASE?).
