then there must be some collision handling that raise the complexity to
O(N) like with the hashtable, if the depth is fixed and if 32bits of
index are enough regardless of how many entries are in the tree.
I'm confused by the comments I heard so far, but well I don't want to
bother you further until I have clear how this data structure is layed
out exactly. I mainly wanted to give a warning, to be sure some point is
evalulated properly before integration.

of course if we add kmalloc to the pagecache code we can drop such part
from the page structure with the hashtable too.
