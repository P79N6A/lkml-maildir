And if we would try to put the ptes onto quicklists then we would get into 
more difficulties with the tlb shootdown code. Sigh. We cannot easily 
deal with ptes. Quicklists on i386 and x86_64 only work for pgds,puds and 
pmds. And as was pointed out elsewhere in this thread: The performance 
gains are therefore limited on these platforms.
