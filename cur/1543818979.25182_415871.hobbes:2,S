I've hit that limit once. Got around it by using rdev to set root
directory and ramdisk
paramiters.
What made the command line so big is that initrd was broken on that box (kernel
was too close to the size of the floppy), so I had to use load_ramdisk.
Stupid box couldn't boot from CD, so that was the source of the trouble.
