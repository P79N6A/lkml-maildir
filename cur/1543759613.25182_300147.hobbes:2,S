	Well, Linus's rules regarding signoff are good as well.  I'd
suggest, once there is a set of $sucker-evaluators, we could use a good
rule like requiring 5 folks to signoff (Linus's original proposal), or
3 including the subsystem maintainer (who doesn't have to be part of
$sucker-evaluators) - whichever comes first.  Any patch that affects an
area where it isn't easy to determine who is the authorative maintainer
just has to wait for the full 5 person signoff.
