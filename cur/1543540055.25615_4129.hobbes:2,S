There appears to be some crud in there, particularly:
+#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
+irq_cpustat_t irq_stat[NR_CPUS];
+#else
+irq_cpustat_t irq_stat;
+#endif
Since:
	irq_cpustat_t irqstat[1];
takes the same space as:
	irq_cpustat_t irqstat;
In addition:
	smp_processor_id()
on a non-SMP machine is:
	#define smp_processor_id() 0
Removing all the #ifdef crud causes:
1. No performance penalty
2. No space penalty
3. Makes the code easier to read
This has to be a win.
