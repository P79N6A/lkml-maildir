Hi,
(sorry if i am wrong here; could in that case someone tell me the
right place to report this?)
I installed 2.6.0-test1 kernel on my acer laptop. Seems to run quite
well (even APM works now), but when I try to rerun LILO (when I
recompiled the kernel), it does not work on 2.6.0-test1 kernel:

hda1 is a fat32 partition w/ windows on it.
When I boot 2.4.20, i can rewrite LILO w/o errors.
looking at /proc/ide/hda/geometry reveals on 2.4.20:
---
physical     19485/16/63
logical      1222/255/63

on 2.6.0-test1:
---
physical     19485/16/63
logical      19485/16/63
---
/proc/partitions is in both cases:
---
major minor  #blocks  name
   3     0    9820440 hda
   3     1    7719201 hda1
   3     2    1992028 hda2
   3     3     104422 hda3
