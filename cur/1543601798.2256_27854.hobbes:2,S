Note that we only support preemption on i386 thus far, so this is not an
issue (yet).
One other note, in not all cases is it OK to just drop the one lock
(above it is).  Say we hold a spinlock, but another lock (most notably
the BKL) is also held.  Since the preemption counter is recursive, we
still won't allow preemption until all locks are dropped.  In this case,
we need to see what else needs to be dropped, or just call schedule()
explicitly.

Looks nice, Andrew.
Anyone try this? (I don't use ReiserFS).
I am putting together a conditional scheduling patch to fix some of the
worst cases, for use in conjunction with the preemption patch, and this
might be useful.
