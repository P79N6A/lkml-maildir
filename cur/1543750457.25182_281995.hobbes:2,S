I have a ThinkPad T42 that can do this, as well, and this is what I
thought when I first encountered this problem. However, I've had this
Gateway laptop since about 1999 and it hasn't done this since. Not in
2.2 or 2.4.
Also, like I said, xev produced no output when I touched and dragged
in the offending areas.
If this really is an added feature and there's a way to turn it off,
that would be okay. Having it off by default would be best since it's
seemingly a changed behavior between one kernel version and another
(also, I hate that feature :) ).
