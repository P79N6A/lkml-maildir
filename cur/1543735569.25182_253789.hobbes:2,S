Mounting of the root device is a fragile process that happens to work
by chance on current setups, but there is a reason while distributions
are now moving to a model where an initrd/initramfs is loaded as the
root device first, which then can do the proper selection of a real
root device, eventually waiting for one to show up, and then pivot to
it. The kernel "built-in" root selection already fails most of the
time with usb-storage or sbp2 (ieee1394)

Arrogance will lead you nowhere here, so step down from your pedestal
and try accepting that your view on things might not be the right one.
