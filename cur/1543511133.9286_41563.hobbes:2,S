I've grepped and read my way through the Documentation directory in the
2.2.13pre11 source tree, and I can't really see what I need to know.  I've also
been watching the L-K list and I've seen some info on cdrw and dvd ram, but
I haven't put together a coherent picture yet, so I have a couple of 
questions:
1)where SHOULD I be looking to find what cdrw/dvd/dvd ram drives are supported?
  I know of parallel interface, usb interface, scsi interface
  and ide interface cdrw's.
  There are parallel cdrw drives, and paride.text indicates that some will
  work, but don't mention any of the available (locally, to me) drives
  I can find.
  I see no reference to usb drives, but I'm pretty sure I would need a
  2.3.x kernel for this anyway to get usb support, and I don't know if
  cdrw is supported under the usb stuff either (or dvd ram for that matter).
  ide.txt makes some reference to cd's but none to cdrw that I can find.
  scsi-generic mentions cdrw, but not what drives work.
2)I want to buy and get a cdrw drive working ASAP, so I'm looking for answers,
  but obviously not in the right places.
3)I don't mind RTFMing, but I haven't found the right FM to read...
pointers are appreciated,
-chuck
