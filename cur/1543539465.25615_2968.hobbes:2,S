Umm... Which may very well mean that
	a) set of commands provided by protocol is misdesigned
	b) we would be better off if we had reasonable set of commands
(preferably the text ones) that could be written to /proc/ide/hd<x>/cmd,
so that hdparm would become an equivalent of echo [commands] >/proc...
	c) ->write() for that file doing all needed locking.
