Yes, I agree also.

I thought about similar change too, but I am unsure about
release_task(old_leader)->proc_flush_task() path (because
I don't understand this code).
This change can confuse next_tid(), but this is minor.
I don't see other problems.
However, I think we can do something better instead of
attach_pid(current)/detach_pid(leader):
	void exec_pid(task_t *old, task_t * new, enum pid_type type)
	{
		new->pids[type].pid = old->pids[type].pid;
		hlist_replace_rcu(&old->pids[type].node, &new->pids[type].node);
		old->pids[type].pid = NULL;
	}
So de_thread() can do
	exec_pid(leader, current, PIDTYPE_PGID);
	exec_pid(leader, current, PIDTYPE_SID);
This allows us to iterate over pgrp/session lockless without
seeing the same task twice, btw. But may be it is just unneeded
complication.

I don't understand why do we need this change.
Actually, I think leader doesn't need reparenting at all.
ptrace_unlink(leader) already restored leader->parent = ->real_parent
and ->sibling. So I think we can do (for review only, should go in a
separate patch) this:
