Good questions, see below for my nominations for the answers.

		Yes, invalidate_mmap_range() permits a distributed
		filesystem to shoot down mmap()s of a to-be-modified file
		so that all nodes see a consistent view of that file's
		data.  Having an export means that this functionality
		need not be reproduced in each and every DFS, reducing
		DFS intrusiveness.
		Of course, the issue pointed out by Daniel does need
		to be addressed.  More on that shortly.

		The invalidate_mmap_range() API is pretty generic.
		It takes an address_space structure, an offset, and a
		length.  The caller can treat the address_space structure
		pointer as a cookie, so the only sorts of changes that
		could break this API would be ones that entirely did away
		with the concept of an address space.  Or that introduced
		the concept of a file with non-integer offsets, in which
		case invalidate_mmap_range() is the least of our worries.
		Either case could happen, I suppose, but both seem a
		bit unlikely.

		Yes, to prevent DFSes from having to reach so far
		into the guts of the Linux VM system.
