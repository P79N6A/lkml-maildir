No, that's not the case. If it md5sum the file one at a time, all is fine.
Both disks are brand new, so I doubt a hardware failure on the disk side..
It could be that it is choking on the fact that one drives is LBA, one
drive isn't. Drives are identical, but dmesg gives different CHS for each
of them..
