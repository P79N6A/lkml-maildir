Sure. But I think it's still a valid paradigm to consider "everything is a
stream of bytes". And that's _really_ what the UNIX paradigm has been from
the first: the whole notion of pipes etc is not all that different from
networking.

I disagree.
The issue is not how you get the data from one place to the other:
"read()" is as good as way as "rcv()". Message passing is not the issue.
The real issue is _naming_, and that's not going away. The name space has
always been the difficult part. And that's where I agree that UNIX could
do better: I think we do want to move into a "web direction" where you can
just do a open("
http://ssss.yyyyy.dd/~silly",
 O_RDONLY) and it does the
right thing.
