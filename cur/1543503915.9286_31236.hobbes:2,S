I'm new to the list.
I have had a problem with Linux-2.2 kernels not being able to establish a
TCP connection, returning a 'connection reset by peer' immediately. This
happens nondeterministically, about 80% of the time.
This problem (I think) only happens to connections routed by a Livingston
Portmaster IRX router running ComOS (v3.5 I think)
2.0 does not suffer.
95/NT do not suffer
MacOS does not suffer.
I have no experimental options in kernel.
ipv4 only. (Haven't tried v6)
3x905BTX network card.
K6-2/450 CPU.
gcc-2.7.2.3 or egcs-1.1.2
Slackware-4.0 reasonably unmodified.
Also running appletalk, smbfs but nothing else 'weird'.
Standard 10Mb hubs running into the Portmaster, and from there into a BT
NTU at 64KBps and down a leased line to VBC (UK)
When I send weird packets to the Portmaster, I get back a lot of packets
with a RST bit set in the header. (Things like nmap -O) I'm pretty sure
it's not a firewall problem in the portmaster, as the firewalling is done
by the Linux boxes themselves, and it should return an ICMP not a TCP RST.
I have seen no trouble over the local ethernet, or between 2.0.x, 2.2.x,
95, NT or MacOS, and I don't seem to have trouble jumping from one half of
the subnet to the other over the portmaster, it's only down the leased
line.
Has anyone else seen this, and has anyone any suggestions for fixing it? I
think we're about to upgrade the ComOS version on the IRX and replace the
leased line.
