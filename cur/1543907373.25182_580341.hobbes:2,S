If host is correctly designed it will have identical pull-ups on all the
DAT lines, and therefore this internal pull-up should be disconnected.
However, given that disabling the pull-up may cause 4 bit transfers to
fail on hardware that omits a host-side pull-up on DAT3 I agree that the
resistor should remain enabled.
Is there an example driver for a host that uses pin 1/DAT3 sensing for
card detection?  I'm curious about how removal detections work.
App Note on card detection goes into the use of this resistor in more
detail but I don't believe this document is publicly available :(.
