The interesting thing about a PAG is that it is a handle that is
shared between userland and the kernel, and carries information about
which collection of authentication tokens/credentials a process holds.
RPCSEC can be made to use it to communicate which bag of creds the
userland daemon may use when it attempts to negotiate a new security
context for an NFS user. At the moment all we can tell is 'use the
credentials of uid=zyx' which is no good if the user wants 2
subprocesses to authenticate using different remote kerberos accounts,
say.
Cheers,
