With 2.4, yes.  You need a complete set of kernel source for every set
of config files you use because the object code is written to the
source directory.  With 2.5 you can have a single source tree and
multiple object trees, one for each config that you are working on.
In either case you must keep separate sets of objects for each config,
mixing objects from different configs in a single tree is a recipe for
disaster.
