While we're on all of this, are we going to change "tained" to some 
other less alarmist word?  Say there is a /proc file or some report that 
you can generate about the kernel that simply wants to indicate that the 
kernel contains closed-source modules, and we want to use a short, 
concise word like "tainted" for this.  "An untrusted module has been 
loaded into this kernel" would be just a bit too long to qualify.
Hmmm... how about "untrusted"?  Not sure...
