Sounds like the way to go.  Since I already passed that patch upwards, I 
will do an incremental rework.  (But perhaps not before spending some 
time on ticket number 9617 at bugzilla.kernel.org's...)

Right; we just shouldn't mix fw-ohci's refcounting (which isn't really 
needed since the lifetime rules for the card are as simple as they can 
get for fw-ohci) and fw-core's refcounting.
