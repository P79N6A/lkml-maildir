I didn't think there were currently any multi socket machines with C3 
support? The best you get is dual core.

Generally there are so many events that wake up CPUs that the case is pretty 
academic -- all CPUs will eventually wake up in a reasonable time
(before your driver initialization finished likely) and then follow
the new latency settings.
Maybe at some point if all the idle breaking events in Linux have been
fixed up it might be a problem, but I think that's a long time off.
