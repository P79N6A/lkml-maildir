I believe it was originally a longer pipeline, and I can't wc the file 
directly or it'll spit out the filename, but < is indeed one less process 
spawned per loop.

Makes a 1/10th of a second difference to the final runtime, but if you prefer 
that...

Yup, a valid cleanup.
The thing is, the script's going to be dog slow no matter what I do, and most 
of the slowness isn't in the script, it's the config infrastructure 
re-parsing the config file 1500 times or so for defconfig.  (The script's 
about 3% of the runtime overhead, and the two largest chunks of that are 
printing out the progress indicator and the sed invocation right above the 
make.)  So I didn't put that much effort into optimizing it.
Someday I'd like to go in and make kconfig spit out a miniconfig directly, but 
kconfig's not really set up to do that, and touching Roman Zippel's code 
would give him the opportunity to say no again.
Anyway, here's a version with your fixes.  Thanks for the review,
Rob
