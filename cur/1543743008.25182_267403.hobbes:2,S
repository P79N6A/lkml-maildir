also note that in the -U series i removed the true 'read' logic from
semaphores. What we have now are single writers only, plus readers
emulated as a writer plus the ability to self-recurse. ('writers' are
not allowed to self-recurse.) This is quite close to the semantic needs
of Linux rwlocks and rwsems and it simplified both locking, deadlock
detection and PI quite significantly.
