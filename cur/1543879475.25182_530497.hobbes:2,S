Probably dumb question (since I'm not at all familiar with the dvb
code): Isn't that a different race you're solving there? I don't see
any driver core objects involved (except class devices created by
class_device_create, which obviously don't have the release function
problem). This looks more like a race of "we want an object to go
away, but a user still has a file open" (which would be similar to the
kobject<->sysfs lifetime rules issues, where work is currently ongoing).
