As I said, this was just for illustration.
What I am thinking about is how to restore the "sig_kernel_coredump() signal
freezes the whole group on delivery" behaviour, we had this before
198466b41d11dd062fb26ee0376080458d7bfcaf.
Afaics this is possible, we could add another SIGNAL_XXX flag but send SIGKILL,
this also unifies the fatal signals processing.
Oleg.
