Hi,
We need to recover some data off an old MFM drive. We've got a bunch
of those cards, we've got a bunch of drives to experment with, but 
once we get things working we'll recover some 2x20Mb of data off two
20Mb drives....
We've tried the modern IDE driver, and the 2.4.20 one, and the "old
hd only" driver. 
Going "retro": Compiling 2.0.39 gives me: "bus error" while doing 
make dep. 
I THINK we have a couple of those cards that don't have any 
interrupts. Would Linux be able to work with those?
Yes, we pass "hda=615,4,17" to the IDE driver. 
Any suggestions of things to try?
		Roger.
