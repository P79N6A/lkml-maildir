There are a few things to keep in mind, however:
1) the default settings shouldn't result in any system
   falling apart, it really should work everywhere
   (though possibly slower than after tweaking)
2) the tunables should make sense and be easy enough
   to tune without first needing to understand all of
   the VM internals

Rik
