You'll still BUG if the destination is multicast/broadcast.  I'm also
unsure whether ipt_REJECT isn't susceptible to the same problem.
Luckily ipt_MIRROR is no more :)
What are the issues with getting rid of the ip_route_input path
altogether?
The only thing we gain over calling ip_route_output is the ability
to set the input device.  But even that is just a fake derived from
the source address in a deterministic way.  Therefore any effects
achievable through using ip_route_input can also be done by simply
reconfiguring the policy routing table to look at the local source
addresses instead of (or in conjunction with) the input device.
Cheers,
