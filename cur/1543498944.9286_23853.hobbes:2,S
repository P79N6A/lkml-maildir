Alpha, MIPS and Sparc64 on the other side do use a 32-bit *pid_t and
are limited by the current implementation to effectivly 15 bit.

Note that I have a chance for a fresh start for MIPS64.  Binary
compatibility is therefore not an issue.  Furthermore it's a 64-bit
architecture, so the code size itself will not increase.
The biggest problem will probably be code which does things like
  int pid;
  pid = fork();
Finding them all is going to be quite a nasty problem.  Making the kernel
/ libc reject pids that are signed / unsigned expanded 32-bit numbers
except init's pid will support that, hopefully.

Pids in the range of [0 ... 32000[ are pretty much tradition among
unices since about the time UNIX was born.  Linux does things slightly
more efficient by using the entire range of [0 ... 32768].
