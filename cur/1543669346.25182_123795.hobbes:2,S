Oliver,
I'm not saying that the messages aren't in English; I'm saying that the 
messages don't *only* have to be in English on the output. The message 
in the kernel could remain as is, but the output kernel message would be 
tailored in the default language of the user's machine, so for example a 
Spanish administrator or developer wouldn't need to know English to read 
the kernel output. I don't think we can assume that all 
administrators/users or developers have English as their primary language.
Regards,
Frank
