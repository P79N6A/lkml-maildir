What _is_ a device from the kernel POV? stat() is an interface-only thing
and it works with external representation of object. Yes, both classes are
currently indexed by numbers. So? register_device() simply doesn't exist
and register_blkdev()/register_chrdev() have different types. For a good
reason. mknod() is working with external representation too. open()...
What is special about open() wrt either block or character devices?
getname()? Hmm... Well, they have prefered names. Fine. Not too serious
thing to share, IMO.

	All _opened_ partitions. I.e. we need a per-disk structure and a
cyclic list going through the opened struct block_device that belong to
that disk. Fine with me, but why bother with MKDEV() here? Once
blkdev_open()/blkdev_get() is done we have this information. Once we had
closed the device we don't care anymore.

Yes, they do.

	block_device is created (or found in cache) when you access inode.
It's bound to _anything_ in the driver only at open time.

Not really. If you'll check the places where we have kdev_t you'll
see that almost none of them can have _both_ character and block devices.
Most of those places are dealing with the requests interface. I.e. can
have only block devices. Where in the code _both_ can happen? ROOT_DEV,
->b_{r}dev, ->i_dev, ->s_dev handling is out of question - it's block
only. Ditto for IO requests. Now, check_media_change() and revalidate()
are block-only too. Ditto for functions in buffer.c and ll_rw_blk.c. Ditto
for partitions and work around struct gendisk. About the only thing I can
think of is ->i_rdev. And in the new scheme block device are not going to
care about it. Comments?

	Maybe. BTW, I have _big_ problems with the floppy.c design (mainly
the lack of fdc.c that could be shared with ftape and the ioctl set in
floppy drivers).

	Yes, indeed. block_device is on partition layer - adding a
disk-layer representative (gendisk on steroids, one for every disk instead
of one-for-every-major) is in the queue. Now, moving the
check_media_change() and friends there... Might be a good idea.

	The former, and only once it's opened - until then it's just a
cache element, waiting to be opened.

And you may want to have partitions on loop...
