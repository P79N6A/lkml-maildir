just tested 2.5.29-vanilla, it works, without and with linear.
2.5.30-vanilla is broken without linear, works with linear.
i dont mind who's at fault, but generally we just dont break working
systems, no matter how good the reason. Somehow communicate with the lilo
folks to handle this in a smooth way. Being able to boot trumps purity, no
matter what.
