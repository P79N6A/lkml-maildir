panic should be marked attribute(noreturn), so gcc is being silly here
by warning at all.
I do this too, because IMHO its inline and won't make things bigger just
shut up the warning.  But Alan will yell at you for fixing gcc bugs in
the kernel source :)
Also, add a comment "fixes gcc warning" next to the code, so people know
why it's there.
