OK, we don't do anything explicit to set the RAM map.  so we looked at 
setup.c to see where that might get triggered, and it gets turned on by 
"mem=".  But we don't use mem=... (meanwhile someone runs cat 
/proc/cmdline...)
Where did that mem=1048000K come from ? (not me)
well, it must be the boot loader, as the kernel didn't add that, and we 
didn't ... looking at the GRUB source ... ARGH: we see in stage2/boot.c in 
that big comment about boot proto 2.03 that grub is indeed adding kernel 
command line options, (even to 2.4.24 and 2.6.8).  How can this be?  Their 
code says it shouldn't, but it does.
This now works fine with GRUB's --no-mem-option added.  Never in all this 
time have I seen GRUB trigger this piece of code and write mem= in on its 
own.  Oh well.
