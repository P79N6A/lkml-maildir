I don't think you understand the nature of the GPL and linux development.
The kernel developers do not have any obligation to anything other than 
technical excellence.  You're getting a highly optimized operating 
system *at no financial cost*.  In return, the community requires that 
certain types of modifications be made publicly available.
If you want to replace the messaging code, make a GPL'd kernel patch and 
make it available to your clients (of course they can then publish it 
all over the place if they so desire).  If those terms are not 
acceptable, there's always BSD.
