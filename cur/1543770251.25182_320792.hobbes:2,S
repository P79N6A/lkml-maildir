Greetings;
Running 2.6.12-rc4, I made several video cd's of a wedding yesterday, 
and did not note this till looking at logwatch this morning:
 --------------------- Kernel Begin ------------------------ 
WARNING:  Kernel Errors Present
   Buffer I/O error on device hdc, l...:  62 Time(s)
   end_request: I/O error, dev hdc, sector...:  198 Time(s)
   hdc: command error: error=0x54 { Ab...:  198 Time(s)
   hdc: command error: status=0x51 { D...:  198 Time(s)
 ---------------------- Kernel End ------------------------- 
The SVCD's play just fine in a commercial dvd player.
The burner, /dev/hdc is, from dmesg:
hdc: LITE-ON DVDRW LDW-451S, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hdc: ATAPI 40X DVD-ROM CD-R/RW drive, 2048kB Cache, UDMA(33)
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.20
This drive has not had the firmware upgrade.  DMA is working.
Burnproof was off for the last 3 copies, buffer was never under 98% 
according to k3b.
Ideas anyone?

Cheers, Gene
