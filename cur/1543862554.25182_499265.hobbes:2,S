Actually this might have been a false alarm. I remembered about
/var/log/messages and looked up how this looked like with earlier
kernels - turns out it looks exactly the same.
(the values dumped there seem to be the initial values of a given field
in a HID-Report)
So there is no regression there, sorry about the confusion.
