The main purpose to the /dev/nvram driver as I see it is to be able to
get hold of system configuration information without rebooting the
system. For this purpose, all that's needed is for /dev/nvram to be a
device that emulates /dev/null and /dev/zero when written to.
In fact, seen from that viewpoint, /dev/nvram would be much better
placed as a directory /proc/nvram with the various fields expressed as
files in that directory. Make /proc/nvram owned by 0.0 with mode 0500
and the files therein ditto, and it's as secure as it needs to be.

I've never met any.

No idea, but I would presume so.
Best wishes from Riley.
