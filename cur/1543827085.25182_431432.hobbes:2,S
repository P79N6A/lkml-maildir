I would propose the obvious...  'cp -a ext3 ext4', apply the extent and 
48bit patches, and then do the obvious search-n-replace.
I guarantee that developer momentum would take over from there.  Rather 
than fundamentally change ext3, let's let it stabilize.

ext3 developers are _fundamentally changing_ the block allocation 
structure [in a good way].  If they can get away with it once, they will 
continue to modify ext3, adding btrees and other new gadgets.  That's 
just human nature.  For example, htree was a minor disaster, 
deployment-wise, on the distro vendor side.
I think extents and 48bit are so fundamental that it's silly to attempt 
to minimize the impact from the user's perspective, and moreover, I 
think Linux benefits more if ext3 is _not_ kept on life support this way.
We need to draw a line in the sand.  If we don't, no one ever will.
