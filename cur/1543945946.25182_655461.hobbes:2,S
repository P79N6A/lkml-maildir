This was not highlighted by checkpatch.pl, right?
The same applies for a few other "fix" you did on some comments.

Can you please explain the rationale behind this change?

I see why you did the cleanup but I think even this part was not
catched by checkpatch.pl

Ok, I got all your cleanup. I just need to compare your work with the relative
checkpatch.pl output, in the past it happened that the error/warning
messages were not
very clear so I agreed with Andy about a couple of changes.
Thanks.
