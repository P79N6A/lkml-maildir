To clarify (with wonderful ASCII art), an un-indexed directory would have
data blocks like:
<d0> <d1> <d2> <d3> (wherever we decide the cutoff is for indexing)
When we start with a single level index, it looks like:
<index header > 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <indirect0>
                                      /  |  |   \
                                  <d0> <d1> ... <dN>

So it would look like:
<index header > 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <index_indirect> <dindirect0>
                                      /    |            /        \
                               <index0><index1>     <indirect0>   <indirect1>
                                                    /  |  |   \
                                                <d0> <d1> ... <dN>

The benefit is that you don't need to do any copying of directory
block pointers (or contents) when you need to go to the next-level
index.
