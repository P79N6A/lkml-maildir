Yes, this probably points at a bug in linus's tree.  This needs more digging.
You're streaming the mp3's over the net or from your disk?

My patch would be equivalent to:
    echo 0 >/proc/sys/vm/max-readahead 
This was just to see if that makes the highlevel throughput match the 
lowlevel throughput, eliminating one variable from the equation.  In -ac you 
have a much more convenient way of doing that.

It should not be being ignored.  This needs to be looked into.  In any event, 
the max-readahead proc setting is clearly good and needs to be in Linus's 
tree, otherwise changing the default MAX_READAHEAD requires a recompile.  
Worse, there is no way at all to specify the kernel's max-readahead for scsi 
disks - regardless of the fact that scsi disks do their own readahead, the 
kernel will do its own as well, with no way for the user to turn it off.

The reason for that is still unclear.  I realize you're testing this under 
live load (you're a brave man) but let's try a bringing the -ac max-readahead 
patch across and try it in 2.4.9.
