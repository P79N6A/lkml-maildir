Hello Jaroslav and other.
I could be wrong.
1) It's cause an compilation error without CONFIG_PNP.
2) We can delete call of snd_card_free in module exit function, it'll be
freed within driver->remove call. It's realy needed only without
CONFIG_PNP_CARD.
Thanks for example of driver, I've understood some tricks from it.
	Best regards, Ruslan.
