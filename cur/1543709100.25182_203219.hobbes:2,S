I do not live an ideal world, However I do live in a practical world of
having to put distribution kernels together.

Ehm no. You entirely forget the cost where the new API and old API need to
work together, which is a significant complexity explosion. When linux grows
a new API that touches so many drivers, there's a good reason for that, eg
the API improves something or makes something possible.
Making powermanagement work is hard, even with 1 API to worry about. With 2
interfering API's it becomes outright impossible and untrackable. 
That's not a scientific perspective, that's a practical perspective where
the scientific theory maybe says you can have 2 parallel api's that never
interact ;)
