Odd. This does not occur without preemption enabled?

Its a patch for when the kernel uses the FPU, specifically during MMX or
3DNow instructions.  That is why iys for Athlon-optimized kernels,
because the Athlon uses 3DNow instructions for some fast page copies.
When the kernel uses FPU, it does not use SMP locks, since that is a per
CPU condition.  However, preemption can occur in the middle of a CPU
doing that stuff, and that messes stuff up very much.  The Athlon patch
fixes it, it is much needed if your kernel is Athlon-optimized.
Userspace FPU is controlled by the kernel already, so we don't need to
worry about that.  In userspace, the kernel handles everything ... in
kernel land, if we want to go play with something (like 3DNow), we need
to take care to set it up and restore ourselves properly.

cat /proc/stat, see the `intr' line, each field is an increasing
interrupt value.
