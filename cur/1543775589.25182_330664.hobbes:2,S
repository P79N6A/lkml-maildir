Probably:
- when it filled the last Tx descriptor sis190_start_xmit()
  issued a netif_stop_queue and returned NETDEV_TX_BUSY;
- the asic completed DMAing the packet and acked it;
- sis190_tx_interrupt later released the descriptor and freed the skb;
-> since NETDEV_TX_BUSY assumes that the driver does not play with the skb,
   one gets interesting results.

I'll polish the thing and sprinkle a few netif_msg_xxx() later today.
