He also, like a lot of academics, ignores reality.  For all his
talk about performance and where NT shines, doesn't he notice how
poorly it performs?  Is the BSOD a feature?
I can't see how a PhD can, in good concience, wax euphoric about NT.
But then, the dean of my alma mater has allowed NT and Windows
into mainstream CS coursework.  Great thing to teach the future
generations.
I hear and read a lot of things about NT's technology, but when you
start using it they don't seem to ever surface, except in bad ways.
Meanwhile, I'm three minutes away from yet another theoretically
inferior kernel so I can run my backward, difficult to use software.
