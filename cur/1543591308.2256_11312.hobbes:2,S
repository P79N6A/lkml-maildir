I disagree that the kernel should apply sequence numbers as devices are
found or hash path information into the device name.
I am unclear of the need for the hashing the path into the name.
In the ptx operating system I previously worked on we ID'd everything
that we could get a UUID from and one's that we could not we generated a
pseudo one. We also split the UUID space up on config type. This is
similar to the discussion in Andreas's mail. Non-id'd devices could
possibly slip, but ID'd ones did not. In user space we allowed the user
to select any name for a device (the user space to kernel connection was
made by UUID. The solution worked on SCSI and FC based devices (Linux
obviously deals with many more device name spaces).
I thought with devfs, devreg, and non allocated major, minors. A
similar capability would be possible. The "/dev" usage would not need
to know the path, but methods would be available to make the
relationship when needed.
