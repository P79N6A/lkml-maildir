This should actually be pretty easy to fix.  We have a nice PAGE_SIZE
buffer.  So, if we are unaligned and would have overflowed the PAGE_SIZE
buffer, we return a short read.
If they ask for a <sizeof(unsigned long) read, we can copy that into the
PAGE_SIZE buffer, then just copy_to_user() the portion that was asked
for.
