Ben, can you put together a first pass on a "VGA arbitration driver"?
You probably know more about the quirks necessary on non-x86 platforms
than anyone else. I can help from the desktop x86 side but I've never
worked on high end hardware that allows things like multiple active VGA
devices. I'm sure the Mac machines and ia64 systems will need some
special code too.
