No idea... without the sysctl, the screen keeps scrolling printing new 
oopes (49 of them in my last attempt), in which case nothing about it 
ever reaches the disk log (and it looks like the kernel buffer is too 
short when using kmsgdump).
  Could it be possible to have something like:
echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops
...and have the system panic at the 2nd oops ?
