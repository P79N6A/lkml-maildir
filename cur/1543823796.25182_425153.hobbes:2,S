In include/linux/file.h, a change between linux-2.5.60 and
linux-2.6.17 was rwlock_t file_lock to spinlock_t file_lock.
In http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=lse-tech&m=98235007317770&w=2
John Hawkes apparently explains this in Finding #3, 
"Because clone'd threads share the identical files_struct, we have
hundreds of threads doing the read_lock() on the same
(rwlock_t)file_lock.  This does not cause overt lock contention (because
with this test load there is no writer-owner of the file_lock), but it
does mean that each read_lock() and each read_unlock() dirties the
file_lock word, which produces that cacheblock ping-pong effect when
another thread on another CPU accesses that same file_lock word."
