It wont help much. seq_read() is fine in itself.
The problem is in established_get_next() and established_get_first() not 
allowing softirq processing, while scanning a possibly huge hash table, even 
if few sockets are hashed in.
As cond_resched_softirq() was added in linux-2.6.11, you probably *need* to 
check the diffs between linux-2.6.10 & linux-2.6.11
files :
include/linux/sched.h
net/core/sock.c      (__release_sock() latency)
net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c  (/proc/net/tcp latency)
