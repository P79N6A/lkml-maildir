Yes, it only is related to isa devices, but they include onboard devices
such as serial ports.  It will, however, prevent resource conflicts
between pci and system devices, especially with unusual configurations.
Does using pnpbios cause your machine to lockup at boot?  If so, around
where does it occur?  DMI information would also be useful for blacklisting
purposes.
Thanks,
