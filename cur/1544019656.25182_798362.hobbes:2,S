        (a single event is required for this)
    1 b) the user may also want to know the time spent in the page fault
    handler to service those faults, therefore involving page fault
    entry and exit events.

Yes, the trace_page_fault_exit takes the "fault" parameter returned by
handle_mm_fault (which is recorded to the trace as the "res" event
field). Using
res & VM_FAULT_MAJOR
will give only the major page faults. Note that some knowledge of the
bitmask is required to interpret the "res" bitfield. This could be done
by a specific analysis module. I would ideally like to create a LTTng
module to export tables including those bitfields so we can keep the
bitfield interpretation in sync with the kernel code changes more or
less automatically.
