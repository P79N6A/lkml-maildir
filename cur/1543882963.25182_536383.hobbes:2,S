Oh well.  Is this really wrong to protect users from such bugs, if we can do

This already is happening.

Practically, yes.  Theoretically, there's no software you can't improve
(except, probably, TeX), but that might not be worth the effort.

I think we'll have an agreement, though.

Well, maybe.

Well, that's a theory.  Probably a good one, but still. :-)
The positive aspect of all this is that people have started to pay attention to
what we're doing, and gradually they will learn about the problems that they're
just not seeing right now.
