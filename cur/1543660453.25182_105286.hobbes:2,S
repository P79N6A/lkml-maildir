 Well it can be normal operation if box is highly loaded...
 At high loads network interrupts are disabled not to trash performance or 
 DoS the kernel. Which in turn does succesive polls via RX-softirq to devices 
 at rate the it can process. So no interrupts when resources are scarce.
 The lack of interrupts makes ksoftirqd run the RX-softirq so the network load
 becomes visable here. Also review the discussion about ksoftirqd priority.
 Cheers.
