Hello,
I spent the weekend trying to track down the reason why Linux (any
recent version), complied for a 486-SX (no FPU), will not boot.
It crashes during startup, about the time it looks for a PCI bus.
The C Compiler (version 2.8.1) was compiled on a i686 machine. If I
recompile on a '486, it will generate a Linux image that boots okay.
So it looks as though the C Compiler, compiled on a 686, generates 686
machine-code instructions. I don't think this is the correct behavior
because the gcc command-line contains -m486. 
So, is there the possibility that something from the gcc library gets
linked into the kernel? If so, how would I prevent it from happening?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson

Penguin : Linux version 2.3.13 on an i686 machine (400.59 BogoMips).
