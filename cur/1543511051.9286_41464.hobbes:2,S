Hi !
I've got two questions :
1. Is there any plan to support mount per process ? I mean a process
   can mount a filesystem and only that process (or process group) see
   it. For example mounting an encrypted filesystem would require that
   only the user is able to read it. afaik this is standard part of Hurd
   and many microkernels, and it's a nice feature to use this with
   Linux too.
2. When will restricted proc be the part of the standard kernel ? Imho
   in multitask environment it's a must not to show process information
   for everyone. afaik Solar designer's patch use the gid mount option
   to have a group which have full access to processes throught the proc fs.
   It's a very light patch, I think it would be easy to integrate.
Thx : Gabor.
