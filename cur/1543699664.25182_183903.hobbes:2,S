I wonder about the "voodoo" because my apic ack delay patch was developed
without knowledge of the C1 disconnect bit and reports I have received so far
are that the hard lockups go away when using it independent of the state of the 
disconnect bit. Apparently the bit was on in my test systems. 
Ian Kumlien pointed out the linkage with the northbridge timing signals 
to the CPU to do with the connect disconnect handshake so I now wonder just how
programmable the nforce2 northbridge is? Is it a bit fpga'ish in that they may be
using the bios boot to alter the handshake timing enough to accomplish what
the ack delay does but like it should be - transparent to the OS?
Of course they -the makers- have access to knowledge we don't so it could be 
something completely different that they are doing!
In short I agree with the suggestion that the new bios options do more behind
the scenes than what the athcool and disconnect patches do. 
I am pretty sure that I read somewhere that when the epox boards 
were first released the epox 8rda bios started out with it (the disconnect bit) off
then the 8rga+ came out with it on by default? So back then people were wanting
to turn it on in the 8rda to lower their CPU temperature - now some want it off
in search of stability? Back then under win.... some experienced lockups depending
on which IDE driver was used and which state the bit was in!
Out of interest has anyone seen new disconnect bit options in the Pheonix bios or
only in the award bios?
Finally I have done some more work and found that the ack delay patch on my
system is about 13 apic timer counts, about half that required to write a byte 
directly outb(0x00, 0x378) to the printer port at 28 apic timer counts. 
So the ack delay is about twice as quick as writing a single EOI to the 8259 in
XTPIC mode provided the 8259 accesses are not souped up under the hood.
In other words whilst it is a timing hit it is not much of one and it won't be
needed once this is all fixed by the respective manufacturers -lets hope they
can do it on the hardware we have already bought.
