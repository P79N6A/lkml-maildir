I would suggest the first thing you want to do is to port it to 2.3.x and
make it work on 2.3.x. If you can get it stable, clean and solid when 2.4.x
appears then it is both a good add on patch and its positioned nicely to
go into 2.5.x . I plan to do the same with the extremely useful swsuspend
patch for example.
