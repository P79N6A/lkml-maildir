Ok.  My only agenda is to get rid of OPEN_MAX.
I then propose the following instead.

[PATCH] avoid OPEN_MAX in SCM_MAX_FD
The OPEN_MAX constant is an arbitrary number with no useful relation to
anything.  Nothing should be using it.  SCM_MAX_FD is just an arbitrary
constant and it should be clear that its value is chosen in net/scm.h
and not actually derived from anything else meaningful in the system.
