This is FW 4.6.2 -- 4.7.0 has been released, so it might be worth
trying that.

Hmm, looks like CONF_SPECIAL_QP is timing out.
MST (or any Mellanox people), any idea why this might happening?  The
NOP command is working fine with interrupts, but CONF_SPECIAL_QP is
timing out.  The difference from the working setup is that the HCA's
local memory is mapped above 4 GB.
