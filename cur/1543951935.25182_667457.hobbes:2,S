lock_contention/lock_acquire() refactor to put common code searching
for an hlock into a common function. A function pointer is pass to ths
common function which can do lock_note* specific functionality. gcc
4.3 will inline this so this will not effect codegen quality for that
compiler version (it's now hitting ubuntu and other distributions)
