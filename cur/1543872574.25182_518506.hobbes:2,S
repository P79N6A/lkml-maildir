It's a good question, I haven't heard anything about this either. Even 
documentation to allow others to implement it would be useful, although 
there may be some kind of IP issues that prevent public release of the 
specs, as I assume has prevented this with the nForce4 ADMA controllers.
I'm not sure what the story is with MCP51 either.. apparently the 
Windows driver NCQ support for that chipset was late in coming but I 
think it does have it now too..
