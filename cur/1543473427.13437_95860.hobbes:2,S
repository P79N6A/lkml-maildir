He just sent me a patch, and I applied that along with marking it
experimental.
The basic problem still stands, though - I applied this patch only because
I trust Alan to do the right thing, but basically the kernel nfsd is in
trouble until somebody stands up and tells me he is willing to maintain
and test patches etc.  It doesn't need to be any super-hacker, it just
needs to be somebody conscentious with a good attitude and good "taste",
and somebody who is able and willing to test out things and live with me.
