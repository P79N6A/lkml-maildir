Sorry for this taking too long. Finally I had the time to play with this 
again, so here goes the current summary. I have a system here, that:
- with 1d67953f2bda8876045c24ae58841f27d9bb7572 (just before the setup 
  code rewrite), resumes nicely in VGA console 
  (acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode kernel parameter is needed), everything 
  works
- with c39736823232bc3ca113c8228fa852c09fba300e (just after the setup code 
  rewrite), VGA text console is garbled after resume - looks like the 
  video RAM contains some strange data (patterns from BIOS post can be 
  recognized, there are some various-colored stripes across the screen, 
  etc). The machine also seems to be frozen (no keyboard LEDs working, 
  etc).
- with 2.6.23-rc9, the video doesn't come up at all, I can't even see the 
  garbled picture any more - the display stays blank, the LED diod is 
  yellow (i.e. looks like completely no signal from VGA card). On the 
  other hand, the machine seems to work otherwise
