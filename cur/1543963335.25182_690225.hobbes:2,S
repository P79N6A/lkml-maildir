Hmm, I was under the impression that this was not an issue (at least not in 2.6.25).

I agree.

Well, cris architecture does not have CONFIG_HAVE_UNSTABLE_SCHED_CLOCK. I guess 
sched rework broker something since it was touched by the above commit, or..:
# CONFIG_CGROUPS is not set
CONFIG_GROUP_SCHED=y
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED=y
# CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED is not set
CONFIG_USER_SCHED=y
# CONFIG_CGROUP_SCHED is not set
 From the 3e51f33fcc7f55e6df25d15b55ed10c8b4da84cd commit Changelog:
  - architectures that have an 'imperfect' hardware clock can set
    CONFIG_HAVE_UNSTABLE_SCHED_CLOCK
How can one do that? Just add it to the .config?
Regards,
Hinko
