That's fine, but I'm afraid that we'll need a bit more than that. A couple of
obvious ones:
	* filemap_nopage() needs the second check for ->i_size. Upon exit.
Moreover, what is (area->vm_mm == current->mm) doing in the existing check?
	* truncate() should zero the page out if it doesn't remove it from
cache.
