Hi Stephen.
Your patch is _great_.
It improves performance a lot.
Without it my test programs needed up to more than 30s with 120M buffermem
and up to 45s with 200M.
With your patch they need 1.5s/2.5s!!!
To compare: with little buffermem after reboot they need 0.3s.
This is a _must_ for 2.2.0!
Best regards,
Heinz
