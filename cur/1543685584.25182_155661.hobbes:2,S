Hi,
My hardware and softare:
  Asus P4P800, 2GB memory, 2.8GHZ P4 with HT enabled.
  On-board 3com Giga bit network card
  1 parallel ata 160G maxtor disk
  Nvidia Gefore4 MX440-8x graphics card (Asus V9180)
  Redhat 7.3, original kernel 2.4.18-3
  Intel Fortran Compiler 7.1
  Intel Math Kernel Library 6.0
My problem is that one of my fortran code always crashes after 10-24 hours.
This code has a heavy IO. It writes out a 5MB binary file every 1 minute.
The error message in  /var/log/message is: (coulson is the name of the computer)
Aug  7 21:11:29 coulson kernel: kernel BUG at page_alloc.c:226!
Aug  7 21:11:29 coulson kernel: invalid operand: 0000
Aug  7 21:11:29 coulson kernel: nfsd lockd sunrpc binfmt_misc sr_mod soundcore
parport_pc lp parport autofs 3c
....
the line number with page_alloc.c varies for different crases (not always 226).
This code also had a heavy IO. Specifically, it writes out a 5MB file every
1 minute.
I have done a couple of tests to try to find the cause, but without success so
far.
1) I have rmmod the 3com2000.0 network driver. The driver source is downloaded
from asus website, and compiled by me. The crash still occurs.
2) I heard of Nvidia binary driver can cause page_alloc.c kernel bug.
I do have a Nvidia Gefore4 MX440-8x graphics card (Asus V9180), but I did
not use Nvidia binary driver. Instead I used the vesa driver coming with redhat
7.3.  Nevertheless, I changed to an old pci ATI rage graphics card. But the
crash still occurs.
3) when the crash occurs, my local X is up and running. I have not tried
the case with local X shutdown.
I also got the same crash when I run the code on a second computer with the
same hw and sw. This makes the hw defect less likely to be the cause.
I am thinking to recompile a new kernel. But now I focus on if it is caused
by some uncompatible module drivers.
I would appreciate your inputs on this. Please cc your answer to me. I am not on
the list.
