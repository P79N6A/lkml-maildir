thanks, applied. Shouldnt we put in an exception for when there is MTRR 
support, but they dont cover anything. Still emit a warning - but 
booting up real slow is still better than losing all of RAM and crashing 
...
i also updated the messages, they now go like this:
  WARNING: strange, CPU MTRRs all blank?
and:
  WARNING: BIOS bug: CPU MTRRs don't cover all of memory, losing 45MB of RAM.
