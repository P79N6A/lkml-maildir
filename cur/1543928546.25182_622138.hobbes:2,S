I expressed some concerns about the GPIO API some time ago, but
that was in the context of ep93xx.

No plans at this point from my side.
I'm not entirely sold on the GPIO API, but nevertheless I expect
that ixp2000 will be converted sooner rather than later.
If you don't want people to use i2c-ixp2000 as an example for new
code, maybe you can stick in a comment at the top of the file that
says that what i2c-ixp2000 does isn't the Preferred(TM) way of doing
it?

Sorry, I seem to have missed the addition of i2c-ixp2000 to
feature-removal-schedule.txt.  I would have spoken up earlier if I
had been aware of it being in there.
It seems odd to me to advocate removal of something which works fine
and for which no functional replacement is available just because it
doesn't conform to the Latest And Greatest API(TM).  That's like
suggesting that Jan 1st 2009 we should rm -f all .c files that still
reference the big kernel lock, or rm -f all ARM ports that don't
use the clocksource/clockevent mechanism yet (which includes
ixp2000 as well.)
Let's just remove i2c-ixp2000 when the GPIO API conversion happens, ok?
