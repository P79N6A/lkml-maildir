The fix is around but I didn't thought it was so critical. Jay did the
fix. I included it into the 2.2.xaax patches but it was not ok with module
symbols (assembler stuff) and so I took it out meanwhile it got fixed
(maybe I understimated its importance?).
Anyway here sym8xxx and ncr8xxx works like a charm on my alpha on both
2.3.47pre6, all the previous 2.3.x and 2.2.14 without need of any
additional patch.

It just works fine here on dp264/tsunami platform (21264 cpu) SMP and less
than 2giga of ram. If other chips have problems with such driver I really
don't know but I just want to say that it's not badly broken but it's very
rock solid on my alpha instead.

There's just an attempt to fix it. It's a patch from Jay Estabrook, I have
uploaded it here but I don't need it with my hardware:
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.14/alpha_delay-fix_jay-2.2.14.gz
Maybe Jay can add some comment about this. The patch is strightforward, it
make sure that the udelay code is allocated in a misaligned address.
