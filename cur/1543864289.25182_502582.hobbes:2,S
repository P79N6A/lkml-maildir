Well my feeling is that in your weird HV case enable/disable should do
all of the work.  And alloc/free won't have to do anything because the
bus doesn't matter any more.

To be clear I see this as 2 distinct layers of code. enable/disable
that talks directly to the hardware, and the helpers of enable/disable
that allocate the irq.  I base this on the fact that I only need the
alloc/free when I am exclusively working with real hardware.

Yes I do.  Because that is the only sane approach for a HV to use.
And yes we need an irq allocator to call the HV to setup the upstream
reception of the msi message.
However I don't think it will be to hard to support your HV once we get
the real hardware supported.  I just refuse to consider it before we have
figured out what makes sense in the context where we have to do everything.

I don't take a type parameter, and I don't take a vector.  All of
that work is done in the generic code.

The current code in the kernel already is structured that way because
we have to reprogram the msi message on each irq migration.  Not using
a helper to write the message would be a noticeable change and require
a fair amount of code rewriting on the currently supported
architectures.

Yes.  In general the mainline linux kernel does not support certain
classes of stupidity.  TCP offload engines, firmware drivers for
hardware we care about, a fixed ABI to binary only modules, etc.
It is the responsibility of the OS to setup MSI so we do it, not
the firmware so we do it.
Not supporting stupid things that are hard to support encourages other
people not to be so silly, especially when linux still works on the
hardware when that silly feature isn't supported.
For similar reasons we don't support more than 1 irq with a plain MSI
capability.  It is hard, we can't do it on most hardware, and anyone
who wants more than 1 irq should just implement MSI-X and everyone
will be able to use it, on any hardware.
Part of the reason to not support a messed up HV interface if it hard
is that a HV is just software.  Which means the incremental cost to
fix it is roughly the same as fixing the linux kernel, and it puts
the burden on the people doing stupid things not on the rest of us
forever more.

No.  I have spent time fixing what is there, and made it work.  I see
implementations proposed that don't handle cases I have fixed, and I
don't see anything that resembles a simple migration path for i386,
x86_64 and ia64.  Which is part of what annoys me when I am told
the ops work for everything.
As for the code not working important parts of the code (like MSI-X)
don't even work on ppc.  The strength of my opposition is largely
shaped by the number of people wearing rose colored glasses and
ignoring the problems, and missing huge details.
Given that we have been talking about things since before OLS I would
have expected the ppc code to be a little farther along.

Not the x86 backend but the raw backend.  You might not need all of
the features because you are always going through another interrupt
controller but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be there.
Michael has at least agreed to look in that direction so I'm hoping
my changes remove some of the difficulty for him.

Well even that was a partial following of that rule because you didn't
rewrite the rest of the kernel at the same time, to better support
usb.  I do agree that there are instances where a complete rewrite is
the best path.  In this case I don't see a reasonable case for not
reusing what is there.
Nor do I see the level of care being put into the problem that would
cause me to trust a rewrite.  I have a huge number of little technical
problems with the proposed code, and see absolutely no overriding
virtue in it.  Especially when the worst of the problems with msi.c
can be easily fixed, as demonstrated by my patchset.
