Yes, you are right it is a lofty goal but we feel we can achieve this 
with safety features built into the system. To facilitate this we are 
providing two modes safe and guru. In safe mode we are trying to limit 
the user to do limited yet useful operations so that they don't 
compromise the integrity of the system. Guru mode is meant for power 
users where we expect the users to know what they are doing hence they 
can do more intrusive operations. Another feature we are doing is coming 
up with a library of routines for common needs. Users can activate these 
routines with a simple scripting language so that they don't write their 
own kernel modules, this limits their ability to compromise the 
integrity of the system. We expect users to use this method 
predominantly in the safe mode.
