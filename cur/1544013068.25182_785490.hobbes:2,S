Yes.  The way ia64 deals with this is the SAL (bios) does much of the
platform specific interpretation to identify the failing hardware
and passes that information up to linux.  That allows the kernel
to be more platform independent while the SAL (bios) deals with the
platform specifics.  
The problem of not having a spec, such as the ia64 SAL spec, is
that other interfaces end up getting overloaded, such as 
the DMI tables.  Should this be part of the EFI standard?
It really does need to be part of a standard specification.

I believe that is the right approach.  Error handling was one
of my primary motivations for getting in EFI runtime services
for UV.  Having a more standard interface, rather than platform
specific, would be good.

In ia64, salinfo_decode looks for duplicate records when reading
from SAL (bios).  SGI SAL uses hardware timestamps when building 
error records to avoid duplicates.  There are still occasional
duplicate records in a few cases, but rare enough to not be a
problem.  
One case that always generates duplicate records is a recovered
MCA.  The MCA record is logged to NVRAM before linux tries to 
recover (in case the system crashes).  After recovery, the MCA
record is logged with a recovered status, making the record look
different than the record logged to NVRAM (to salinfo_decoded).
salinfo_decoded logs both the original MCA record and the MCA
record marked recovered (writing them to /var/log/salinfo/decoded).
It turned out to be useful to have both records when explaining
to customers how error recovery worked (in the case of an
application hitting a memory uncorrectable error).  When they
realize that each duplicate MCA record represents a time that the
system did not crash, they suddenly like those duplicate records. :-)
The bigger concern is not losing records (especially with a burst
of errors).  The issue is keeping the older (more significant)
error records and dropping the newer (less significant), not
to be confused with thresholding correctable errors...
