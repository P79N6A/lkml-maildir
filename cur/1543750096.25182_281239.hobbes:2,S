The kblockd message is just a symptom of the machine running low on
memory and starting to fail normal kernel memory allocations.  There's
always a potential for hangs when something can't allocate memory:
usually it's in the middle of a transaction and just forgets about it;
what should happen (as we just verified SCSI does) is that the
transaction should be rolled back and retried.

That's unfortunate.  It means that whatever caused this left no trace.
The best working theory is still a memory allocation failure somewhere.
If it occurs again, could you get a full system process trace (<alt>-
<sysrq>-t) and send that?  That might give a better clue as to what went
on.
