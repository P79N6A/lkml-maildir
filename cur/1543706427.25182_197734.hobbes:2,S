Sadly, objdump turns up nothing really interesting. The kernel image is
in i386-linux a.out format. This is all it gives me for headers:
SOME.FILE:     file format a.out-i386-linux
SOME.FILE
architecture: i386, flags 0x000001be:
EXEC_P, HAS_LINENO, HAS_DEBUG, HAS_SYMS, HAS_LOCALS, WP_TEXT, D_PAGED
start address 0x00100020

It is easier to read some of the function names and other things using
objdump's -s option, but beyond that it's not much more useful than
strings. It appears that I will have to get medieval on it.
