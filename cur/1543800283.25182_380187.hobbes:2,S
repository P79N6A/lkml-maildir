Well, that falls under (a) in my opinion.
Some "damn specialized" stuff has actually ended up being merged. It's 
rare, but it happens. The VFS dentry layer is an example of a crazy 
experimental thing that I liked the concept of so much that I merged it, 
and it paid pack handsomely.
So there's just different classes of (a) - ranging from the "not just 
ready yet" to "crazy strange stuff that might never be" ;)

Yeah, that goes pretty much without saying.

Sometimes the "crazy experimental stuff" ends up being useful even if 
never merged: it gives people ideas of other things to try, and maybe we 
later end up merging something that was inspired by something totally 
crazy. 
So I think the strange specialized stuff can end up being useful in many 
ways, both directly and indirectly.
