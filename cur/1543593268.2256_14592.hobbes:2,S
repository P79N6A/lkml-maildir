That could cause alignment problems.

set_bit requires word alignment, but without the __attibute__ the
compiler would only guarantee 16-bit alignment. IMHO ugly.
Should I add __set_bit_{8,16,32} into <linux/bitops.h>, overridable with
__HAVE_ARCH_SET_BIT_n?
Default implementation for the nonatomic __set_bit could be added into
<linux/bitops.h>, too.
Btw, the correct name would be __set_bit_n: the function don't guarantee
atomicity.
