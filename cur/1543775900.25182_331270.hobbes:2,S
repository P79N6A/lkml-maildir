Just don't allow user-created hardlinks inside either metafs (/meta) or
the magical meta directory inside files.
In order to do that, one way would be to have "file/..." appear as a
mountpoint.  I don't know if this is feasable, performance-wise, but I
think it would work.

This is still my preferred solution, because it's not any harder or less
efficient to develop new apps based on metafs than on file-as-dir, but
it means that old apps will see something *entirely* POSIX-compliant,
and the strangeness will be confined to /meta.
Basically, you have to allow hardlinks in /meta, in case some plugin
wants to do that, but if you have files that are also directories, you
also have to make sure that users can't create hardlinks.  I don't think
this would be particularly hard, though.  Pretend it's a read-only
filesystem unless the user is doing something safe, like creating a
brand-new file, deleting an old one, or modifying the contents of an
existing one, all assuming that the plugin responsible for the
file/directory you're doing this in allows it.
But then, if we're doing metafs, I don't think you need
file-as-directory, and certain existing tools that we'd like to be able
to point at metafs might not like file-as-directory anyway.
Now, can anyone think of a situation where we want user-created
hardlinks inside metadata?  More importantly, what do we do about it?
