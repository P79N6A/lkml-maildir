 From these traces you can clearly see that no STANDBY IMMEDIATE 
(command code 0xE0) was issued before the power-off, which is what would 
prevent this problem.
If you wait long enough after halting before you power down, you may not 
get the noise, since many laptop drives unload the heads after a fairly 
short period of inactivity, and so the heads are already unloaded when 
the power is shut off.
