Hi Yani,

If you could come up with an additional demonstration patch for either
the lm90 driver or the it87 driver, I would happily give it a try. The
adm1026 has very few users AFAIK so it might not be the best choice to
find testers, although I agree that it was a convenient way to
demonstrate how drivers could benefit from the proposed change.
And, once again, thanks *a lot* for looking into this, this is very much
appreciated.
