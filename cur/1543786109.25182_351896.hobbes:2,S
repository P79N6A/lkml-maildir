What symbol must be between
-D'DUM(a)=\#a'
and
-D'KBUILD_MODNAME=DUM($(subst $(comma),_,$(subst -,_,$(modname))))')
?
I tried a space, comma and no spaces, also with quotes and without any, but
got an error above.
Here is my line:
modname_flags  = $(if $(filter 1,$(words $(modname))),-D'DUM(a)=\#a'
-D'KBUILD_MODNAME=DUM($(subst $(comma),_,$(subst -,_,$(modname))))')
