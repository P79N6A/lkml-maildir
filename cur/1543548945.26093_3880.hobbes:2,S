Subject: [PATCH] update to new VM
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi Linus,
after increasing the test base, the following 2 problems have
been noticed with the VM patch, and are (hopefully) fixed in
this patch:
1)  if __alloc_pages() is called without __GFP_IO in the
    gfp_mask, we cannot wait for kswapd
        -> use try_to_free_pages() the oldfashioned way instead
1b) while fixing up the other __GFP_IO problems, I noticed
    programs at schedule points in the VM, sleeping in S state,
    this is fixed by explicitly making them runnable
2)  the VM was badly balanced for low-memory (8MB) machines,
    this has been fixed by making it easier for kswapd to go
    to sleep in refill_inactive() and by waking up kswapd earlier
    at the top of __alloc_pages()
I'm still not 100% sure if this patch is completely correct,
but it fixes one serious bug in the current VM inside -test9-pre1
and I'm leaving for Linux Kongress tomorrow so this is my last
chance to post anything for the next few days ;(
If this patch proves stable for everyone and makes 8MB machines
workable again with the new VM, please include this in the next
pre-patch. If it doesn't work correctly, I'll somehow find it
in my email while at Linux Kongress and I'll prepare a new fix.
regards,
Rik
