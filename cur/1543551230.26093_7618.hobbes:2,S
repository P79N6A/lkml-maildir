Will you please try this patch? This is almost the same as I
sent to you before, it is just against 2.4.0-test10-pre1 and
it lacks the corrections to e.g. the frame buffer drivers.
I am now running test10-pre1 with this patch and:

[root@localhost /root]# cd /proc
[root@localhost /proc]# cat mtrr
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
reg05: base=0xe2000000 (3616MB), size=  32MB: write-combining, count=1
[root@localhost /proc]# echo "base=0x200000000 size=0x100000000 type=write-combining" >mtrr
[root@localhost /proc]# cat mtrr
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x00200000000 (    8192MB), size=    4096MB: write-combining, count=1

This is on a dual P-III machine with 128 MB memory.
If it causes problems on Athlons then change the line
#define AMD_OR_MASK    (0xfffff000UL)
to
#define AMD_OR_MASK    (INTEL_OR_MASK)
and recompile and tell me what happens. Also, I would like to hear
reports from non-Intel (Cyrix, etc.) and older AMD machines.
I do not have my Cyrix 6x86MX anymore but this scheme worked on that.
