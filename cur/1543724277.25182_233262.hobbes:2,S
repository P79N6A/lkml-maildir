I've now checked code into CVS for this, so smartmontools now can be used
with 3ware/AMCC 9000 series controllers (3w-9xxx driver). Many thanks to
Adam Radford for his help with this.
I'd be grateful if you could give it a try and report back. I'm especially
interested in reports about 64-bit or big-endian (or both) hardware.
You'll need to follow the instructions at 
http://smartmontools.sf.net/
 to
check a copy out of CVS and build it.  You'll have to use the 'character
device' syntax to address the disks, for example:
./smartctl -a -d 3ware,0 /dev/twa0
./smartctl -a -d 3ware,1 /dev/twa0
./smartctl -a -d 3ware,2 /dev/twa0
for the first three disks on the first controller, and
./smartctl -a -d 3ware,0 /dev/twa1
./smartctl -a -d 3ware,1 /dev/twa1
for the first two disks on the second controller.  Likewise use /dev/twa?
in /etc/smartd.conf.
If you don't have the /dev/twa? devices on your system, please run the
tw_cli or 3dmd tools once: this will automatically create the /dev/twa?
nodes.
I've also added support for 6000/7000/8000 cards to use the character
device interface /dev/twe?.  These devices can ALSO use the SCSI interface
via /dev/sd?
Cheers,
        Bruce
