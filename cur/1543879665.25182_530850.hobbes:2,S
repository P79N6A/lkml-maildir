ok but do you think it's safe to assume that no others parts of the
kernel will request "aes-foo" ? Remember that the main point is to
optimize "aes-foo" ?
I would say that it would be better if "aes-foo" could raise a flag
for example indicating to the crypto core that this algo can be
instatiate only one time...
