Please wait.
I don't want that semantic for sysfs. First, I don't want to "move
around" the VGA device. This is very arch specific and will not work in
a variety if circumstances. Also, "outb's" to legacy VGA ports will only
work with some PCI domains on archs like PPC, even vgacon can't deal
with that, so let's avoid putting such "knowledge" in the arbiter
itself. I prefer for now defining a "default" vga device which is the
one used by vgacon. If you want to move vgacon around, do some arch
specific stuff or add way to change the default device, but that isn't
directly related to the arbitration process.
Also, I want the sysfs entry (or /dev if I can't get the proper
semantics in sysfs) to have open & release() callbacks like a char
device. The reason is that I want the vga "locks" owned by a process to
be automatically released if the process dies. Without that, kill -9 on
X will end up requiring a reboot in most circumstances :)
Finally, I want to keep the distinction between memory and IO enables.
That's quite important imho, since a lot of cards can operate with IO
disabled (all ATIs for example), which is good as I'm not completely
sure I can disable legacy IO port decoding on them (well, I don't know
how to do it).
