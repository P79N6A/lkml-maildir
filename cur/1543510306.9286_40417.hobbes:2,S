Linux Gurus,
I have been struggling these two issues for a while and tried suggestions
from some warm hands.  Unfortunately the problems are still exist.  I really
need some Linux guru to help since these issues are critical to me.
I am running RH6.0 on HP E45 UP system and Intel Viper with 8 CPUs (checked
that 8 processors are shown up in /proc/cpuinfo).  The driver is for fibre
channel HBA (using scsi protocol) and has been tested on UP system well.  
Issue #1:
I am trying to make module run under SMP system (Viper with 8 CPUs) but
failed in loading process.  System message: 
	./hpfc: kernel was compiled for kernel version 2.2.5-15
	while this kernel is version 2.2.5-15smp
I have tried some suggestions:
1, Reconfigured the system with 'make menuconfig' to support SMP.
2, Ran 'make dep' after system reconfigured.
3, Checked that file /boot/System.map-2.2.5-15smp does exist.
4, Included -D__SMP__ and -I/usr/src/linux/include/linux/modversions.h in
CFLAG.
5, Included asm/smp.h and asm/spinlock.h as driver header files.
6, Compiled after 'make dep' with new system configuration which support
SMP.
7, Loaded driver with 'insmod hpfc' and 'insmod -f hpfc'.
The above system message still comes up during the 'insmod' operation.
Really need someone gives me a hand on it.
Issue #2:
I have two HBA in a system.  One HBA has two HDs and another has eight.
During the module loading process, two cards are recognized and all 10
devices are being inquired.  System message shows all devices are detected.
I have checked that under /dev, the device node from sda to sdp (total 16)
exist.  sda is used for primary boot drive.  There should be enough for
those 10 tested devices.  However, after successfully detected all 10
devices, only four device nodes are given to be accessible, sdb, sdc, sdd,
sde.  Two of them from first HBA and two from the second.
I also tried qlogic fibre channel HBA with 8 device connected.  The result
is the same.  Only four devices are accessible.
I know something is missing since at least 15 scsi device can be addressed
from system default setting but don't know what.  Also need someone to help.
Following is the system message during the driver loading:
scsi1 : HP Tachyon Fibre Channel HBA on PCI bus 00 device 06 irq 10 with
IOBaseLow 0xec00 
scsi2 : HP Tachyon Fibre Channel HBA on PCI bus 00 device 0c irq 9 with
IOBaseLow 0xf800 
scsi : 3 hosts.
