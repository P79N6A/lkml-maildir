Hi,
Some days ago, I reported a reproducible hang during boot. The
information around was quite vague and so I took the liberty to further
dig into the the call stack of pci_init and found the exact place where
the initialization locks.
But first the symptoms (those are improved as well):
If I turn on or restart my computer and try to boot without my
intervention, the system always hangs during boot, the last output being
the io scheduler registration. However, if I press a key at any time
after the BIOS (for example manual choosing  the grub entry or during
the kernel messages) the system happily boots normally.
After a little printk debugging, it turns out, that
quirk_usb_handoff_ohci will hang when applied to my first USB OHCI pci
device. I have marked the offending line in the following snippet (line
186 in the original---the second writel)
============ (startint at line 182 inn pci-quirks.c)
[...]
    u32 control = readl(base + OHCI_CONTROL);
    if (control & OHCI_CTRL_IR) {
        int wait_time = 500; /* arbitrary; 5 seconds */
        writel(OHCI_INTR_OC, base + OHCI_INTRENABLE);
       // The next line might hang
        writel(OHCI_OCR, base + OHCI_CMDSTATUS);
        while (wait_time > 0 &&
                readl(base + OHCI_CONTROL) & OHCI_CTRL_IR) {
            wait_time -= 10;
            msleep(10);
        }
[...]
=========
The lspci output for the device is
