Hi Norbert!
your config seems reasonable to me ...

AFAIK, there is no such message in 2.6.0-test3 ...
if, on the other hand, the message looks like ...
-----------
VFS: Cannot open root device "hdb1" or unknown-block(0,0)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
-----------
then this means that "hdb1" was the device given at
the kenel command line (as root=/dev/hdb1) and the
'unknown-block(0,0)' is the major/minor the kernel 
recognized ...
you should pay special attention to the disc/partition
discovery done by the IDE subsystem ...

hdb: 131074 sectors (67 MB) w/256KiB Cache, CHS=130/16/63
hdb: hdb1 hdb2 hdb3
...
-----------
maybe you could attach a serial console (line)
and capture the boot process, and report it ...
HTH,
