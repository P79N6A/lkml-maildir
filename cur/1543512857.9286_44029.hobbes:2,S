I think the problem is elsewhere. I've had this numerous times with 486ers and
_fast_ disks and those first Pentium mainboards that had non-supported IDE
with high PIO modes. I think the problem is not the CPU. The IDE is not giving
the CPU and/or the bus a life. 
So:
Q1: What kind of IDE controller do you have?
Q2: What are the drive modes?
Brgds,
