Actually, it makes sense in a way - noatime only speeds up reads, not
writes, (access time is always updated on a write), whereas a
journaled filesystem is presumably intended to be tuned for write
performance.  So, for it's intended usage, not implementing noatime
shouldn't be a huge problem, although it would be useful.
