In the 2.4 kernels, the chipset was compiled in with the agpgart
module.  Now they are separate.  So, yes, modprobe via-agp
did the trick.
How can get the modprobe.conf file to load this module after
agpgart and not crash the system?  My attempts to make this
work using the install command example from the manpage
have been generally disasterous.
Thanks,
