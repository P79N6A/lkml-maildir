Same argument goes for C, though to a lesser extent. When the compiler breaks
down, it's a bit hard to figure what to change in your code to get around
the bug.  For instance, I am  switching some code  from gcc 2.8.1 to 
egcs 1.1.1, and I have an awful time figuring out why the resulting executable
is 2% larger (which is problematic as it's supposed to be a boot floppy...)
There are some weird differences in code that are triggered by register
allocation which are difficult to trace to one specific point. Even knowing
whether the newer compiler is better is hard.
I also had to trace bugs through preprocessed inputs. The linux kernel 
(and other OS code, for that matter) is an intricate piece of clockwork that
uses intricate macros and inline assembly to do complicated things fast,
but with no type-checking, and in a way difficult to follow for a debugger.
I'll suggest that C++ is much better for this kind of task, as it can do
the same things cleanly, and warn you about problems. You definitely know
C much better than C++, so even with the kind of stunts the kernel-code
must go through, you still prefer C, where C++ would be cleaner (and
generate the same code).

There is the same problem with C. The difference is that it's already
been taken care of, and that the experts exist today.

You've been working with bad programmers.

I concur with that ! A switch to C++ is not going to happen because
of cultural reasons. C++ is a large enough language that it is difficult
to learn to write efficient programs with it.  With some skill, it can 
outperform nearly anything (template expansions can be incredibly 
powerful. Some people are using it to beat Fortran 90 at its favorite
games), but there are nowhere near enough skilled C++ programmers that want
to re-write the linux kernel.
