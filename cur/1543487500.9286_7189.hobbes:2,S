Alan pointed out problems with that. Also, consider that there is an
installed base of hardware which isn't going to be replaced anytime
soon. At least not here. The way this place works is that funding for
purchasses and funding for personnel is quite separate, so funding the
effort to fit an application into available hardware is easier than
buying the hardware to fit the application.
I've hit my head against this brick wall more times than I care to
think about. It's fustrating, but it's life.

Why do you keep saying that it's at the expense of the generic kernel?
I've explained time and time again how the current code (all that
special-casing for the RT scheduling class) is complex and fragile,
but you never respond directly to these points.
My changes are cost neutral at worst and improve the quality of the
scheduler code.

I've raised a number of points. It's all there in the document I wrote
last year: 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
and the mail archives.

Well, I do understand the issues, but I'm not going to waste my time
sitting your exam. If you look through the mail archives you can even
see where I've talked about the advantage of RT and non-RT scheduling
classes in a *single* application which is the only thing running on
the system. The clock application I mentioned is one example of it.
So don't present this as though I'm trying to push for RT applications
running perfectly on a time-sharing system. Even where I *have*
pointed out the benefits to a separate RT run queue for systems
sharing RT applications and normal user processes, I've taken pains to
mention that there are many other problems which have a greater effect
on latency.
When I say "this would help shared RT/normal systems", you should not
take that to mean "this will solve problems sharing RT and normal
jobs", nor even "this will solve the biggest problem...". I've even
said in the past that, in the context of sharing RT and normal jobs, a
separate RT run queue is one of the smaller issues.
But there are other issues, which is why I think it's worth
considering. Even the simple fact that it simplifies the scheduler
code and makes it less fragile is in my view sufficient justification,
even if there were no performance benefits at all.

I have no problem with the RT-Linux concept. I've said before I think
it's a fine idea. The reaction I've received from people is that it's
an incomplete programming environment (i.e. lack of semaphores). I've
actually argued against them on some of these issues, pointing out
that they could just use the RT pipes as a synchronisation
method. Remember I'm talking to people who aren't used to the Unix
way, so I've had to explain the Unix philosophy. It's hard work
convincing someone that a "missing feature" doesn't mean an OS is
lacking but rather that they've got the wrong mindset.
Where I do agree with the criticisms is that using RT-Linux is hard,
because it doesn't fit seamlessly into the Linux/Unix programming
environment. You can't take standard POSIX RT code and have the POSIX
RT threads be RT-Linux threads. You have to stuff around with loading
modules and separating your code into co-routines: separate
programmes. I'd like to see this changed.
Ideally, a thread could ask to become an RT-Linux thread (using
sched_setscheduler()). I acknowledge this is hard to achieve, but it's
what would make using RT-Linux so much easier. This is important for
people who have a certain reluctance in the first place. [*]

Well, I've given some of my suggestions. Lets take that further. The
changes I proposed to the standard Linux scheduler do 2 things:
- improve RT performance by isolating the run queues
- improve robustness and maintainability of the code by
  simplification.
If we ignore the first issue and just look at the second, let me
propose a perhaps radical idea: we *remove* SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR
from the standard Linux scheduler. This would also simplify the
scheduler, making it faster and more robust. All that special-casing
for POSIX RT would be removed.
Of course, we have to support the POSIX RT scheduling classes, so just
removing them isn't really an option. But suppose instead my (perhaps
unrealistic) idea mentioned above (*) was implemented so that a thread
which asked for RT scheduling got *real* RT? Now that would be nice.
Before you flame me, I'll say that I haven't thought out the problems
with implementing this. Take it is as a "wouldn't it be neat if...".
Assuming the above idea is dumb, please address the issue of the
current complexity and fragility of the standard scheduler. If there's
to be any hope of a productive debate, this issue needs to be
addressed.
I would be apprehensive in pushing a patch that added a separate RT
run queue *if it added complexity to the current code*, for the very
same reasons you have. I agree with the principle of reducing kernel
bloat (although it shouldn't be a straight-jacket). But my patch
*simplifies* the scheduler. This is why Linus was positive about it in
the first place, I believe. The patch just makes things so much
cleaner.
If you prefer the current complexity, at least explain *why*.
