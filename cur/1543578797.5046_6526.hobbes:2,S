I feel it important to note that the distrib in use for all of this is of
my own design. The specs are at www.kixolinux.com.
Why do I feel this is important? Possibly something I've done in the
distrib could be affecting this as well. I remember reading some weeks ago
about the 2.4.0-test## series + SCSI + SMP were having some problems.
The drives are as follows
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xb000-0xb007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
hda: WDC WD153AA, ATA DISK drive
hda: 30064608 sectors (15393 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=1871/255/63, UDMA(66)
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xb000-0xb007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
hdb: WDC WD300BB-00AUA1, ATA DISK drive
hdb: 58633344 sectors (30020 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=3649/255/63, UDMA(66)
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xb008-0xb00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hdc: SAMSUNG CD-ROM SC-148F, ATAPI CDROM drive
hdc: ATAPI 48X CD-ROM drive, 128kB Cache, DMA
The errors are as follows 
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
hdc: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
hdc: command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: command error: error=0x54
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 929520
hdc: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
hdc: command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: command error: error=0x54
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 929522
 
I get the same thing for hda and hdb though not as frequently as with
hdc. (Controller doesn't like switchign between DMA and PIO modes
possibly? ::shrug::)
