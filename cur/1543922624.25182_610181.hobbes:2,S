Clearly some process is still using a deleted file. However, if it 
doesn't happen with 2.6.22.x kernels, it would seem fall under the 
category of regression, in the "used to work" sense. Before going 
further you may want to be really sure that an older kernel doesn't do 
this, so no one wastes time on a non-problem.
Assuming the older kernel works fine, it's possible that some new 
behavior of the kernel as causing a process to misbehave, and step one 
is to use lsof and try to find the process. It's possible that "top" 
might be useful, although whatever is using the disk space may just be 
lurking.
