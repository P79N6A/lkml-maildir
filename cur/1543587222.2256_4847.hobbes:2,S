Hi,
This isn't working here on my Abit VP6 board.  The
ide.2.2.18.1221 works fine but this latest patch as well as
ide.2.2.19.0325 fails.
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.30
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
VP_IDE: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
VP_IDE: chipset revision 6
VP_IDE: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
VP_IDE: VIA vt82c686b (rev 40) IDE UDMA100 controller on pci00:07.1
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xc000-0xc007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xc008-0xc00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
HPT370: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 70
HPT370: chipset revision 3
HPT370: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide2: BM-DMA at 0xec00-0xec07, BIOS settings: hde:pio, hdf:pio
    ide3: BM-DMA at 0xec08-0xec0f, BIOS settings: hdg:DMA, hdh:pio
hda: Maxtor 92720U8, ATA DISK drive
hdg: Maxtor 96147U8, ATA DISK drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide3 at 0xe400-0xe407,0xe802 on irq 10
That's where it stops.  Locks solid, not even sysrq-b
works.
