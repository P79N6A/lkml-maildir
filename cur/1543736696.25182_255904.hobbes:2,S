I was pointed to this (rotating) banner advert at the top of www.eweek.com
It claims that when comparing Red Hat AS2.1 with Windows Server 2003 on a dual processor machine, Windows Server 2003 gives 276% better peak performance, quoting Veritest as the source.
I think the report in question must be this one
http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/7/1/0715a190-70f5-4b0d-8ced-f9d1e046aa6a/netbench.pdf
Its dated April 2003, so this was probably discussed a long time ago, but can anyone point me in the direction of an analysis/rebuttal of this report from the linux community? "Windows webserver gives 3x performance of linux" is something I need to be able to debunk, assuming it's inaccurate.
