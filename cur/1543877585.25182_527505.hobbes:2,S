Apcupsd is the one on my mind, but I believe there are others.

Thanks!

On Apcupsd we've recently introduced a libusb-based driver that does all 
HID parsing in userspace. Not only does that free us from hiddev, it 
also frees us from the umpteen other proprietary HID interfaces across 
various platforms. Although the hiddev-based driver is still the default 
for Linux platforms, I plan to change that in the next major release and 
thus begin migrating folks off of hiddev.
I appreciate your pledge to keep hiddev functioning in the mean time :)
