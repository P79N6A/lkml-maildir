Ok, I finally tracked through the i2o code, and found that i2o_block_device_flush is ultimately
called for fsync.  Sorry for being so dense.
However, it does look like barriers are not directly supported.  So, are they safe to use in ext3,
or is ext3 all fine without them?  Would barriers benefit i2o devices, or is there some reason to
not have them?
As for the controller defaulting to write-back, I still cannot find anything that would set the
cache mode to write-through in the non-battery-backed case.
