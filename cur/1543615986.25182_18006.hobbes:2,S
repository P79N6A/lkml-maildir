The reason for the improved rpm build process is not per say for distrubutation
builders; it is for users who have a number of systems to manage and don't want
to have non package things floating around. 
That said it looks like the best thing for me to do might be to move the "make rpm"
function out of the Makefile and into a seperate script when kbuild 2.5 is 
made live in the main line. The rpm build does not use the make system to
build first phase and after that is under the control of RPM itself. 
I assume that the xconfig, oldconfig, config and mconfig are present in
kbuild 2.5?
What is the correct method to tell if 2.5 is live?
