I think the problem is "who is make *config" for?".
David wants it to be for developers (ISTM) and "select" is a
hassle for us.
Linus wants it to be for (unadvanced) users, but they tend to just
use distro kernels and distro configs, according to David, and I
agree with that.
So I think that make *config is more for developers and advanced
(not embedded) users.

It's a real problem for developers who actually try to modify
configs.
