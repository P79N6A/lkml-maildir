I'm not sure where the error is, but...
In 2.5.67, you can configure the tulip or winbond driver as modules and the
CRC library as built-in, but it doesn't work -- the CRC functions aren't
visible to the modules at load-time.  It compiles just fine, except for
depmod complaining at the end.

I think the problem is there's a nut loose on your keyboard.
