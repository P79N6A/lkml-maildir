It would be nice to express those dependencies in some clearer and less
fragile manner than link order.  I guess finer-grained initcall levels
would do that, but it doesn't scale very well.
But whatever.  I think multithreaded probing just doesn't pass the
benefit-versus-hassle test, sorry.   Make it dependent on CONFIG_GREGKH ;)
