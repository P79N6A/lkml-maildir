I'm not very excited using PG_locked for that, that doesn't only mean
"unswappable", it means also that the page is under I/O (or uner some
other operation that needs serialization like unmapping the page) which
is quite a different concept from VM_LOCKED. a wait_on_page would
deadlock on such a PG_locked page, while wait_on_page on a page of a
mlocked vma doesn't normally deadlock.
But I see what you want to do here, and PG_reserved would be too much
for that since it changes the semantics for cow and free_pages, but
PG_locked doesn't look good enough either, the VM_LOCKED and PG_locked
concept is quite different, PG_reserved and VM_RESERVED is quite close
instead (except for the page->count accounting).
