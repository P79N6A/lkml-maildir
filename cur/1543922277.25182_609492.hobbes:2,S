        The only items left in icmp_statistics are "InMsgs, InErrs, 
OutMsgs, OutErrs",
so if dccp and sctp are sending or receiving any in or out ICMP messages, 
they
should be using the new macros (which reference icmpmsg_statistics, not
icmp_statistics) to count them.
        I took a quick look at SCTP. I don't know if that's going through 
icmp_rcv()
or not; if so, I think it's double-counting; if not, then it isn't 
counting the
individual types (as it should), and it should have ICMPMSG macros doing 
that.
        So, again, icmpmsg_statistics either should stay exported, or 
neither
icmpmsg_statistics nor icmp_statistics should be exported (depending on 
how
SCTP and DCCP code is resolved). It's incorrect in the current code to
incrememnt ICMP_MIB_INMSGS without incrementing one of the types too.
