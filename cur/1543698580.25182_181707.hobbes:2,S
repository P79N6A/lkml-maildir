Just to add more inconsistency into the mix, I am running with preempt
enabled, generic ide disabled, and can't make it crash.  Ran netperf for
an hour over a crossover cable on 100mbit, a couple make -j 30 kernel
compiles, dbench, and playing some mp3's all at the same time and
nothing happens despite load average reaching over 100.  Maybe I am just
lucky.
