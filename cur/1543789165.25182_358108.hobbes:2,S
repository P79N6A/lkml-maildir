Subject: [PATCH 2.6.14-rc4] kbuild: Eliminate build error when KALLSYMS not defined

I encountered a build error with 2.6.14-rc4 when CONFIG_KALLSYMS is not defined. The error
message in a fragment of the output was:
  CC      arch/i386/lib/usercopy.o
  AR      arch/i386/lib/lib.a
/bin/sh: line 1: +@: command not found
make[3]: warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
The following patch seems to fix it. I can't say that I really know why, but noticed this
construct elsewhere in the Makefile and it seems to work.
