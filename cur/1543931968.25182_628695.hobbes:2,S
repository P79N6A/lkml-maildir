It does not look like this issue is common - googling for "Linux EDD Boot 
hang" does not bring up relevant and recent results - in fact this post of 
yours comes on top. Further more there does not seem to be problems with 
newer BIOSes so we would be irritating lot many users needlessly.
Adding 3 printks for each such obscure problem would make it even more 
complex to parse and make sense of the boot log - I, for example, already 
dislike the mostly-useless-to-end-user stuff it spews on a normal boot.
If there are known chipsets / BIOSes that have this problem - applying 
quirks - something like this quirk for pmtmr [1]- (if they work this 
early) or even special casing them with forced edd=off may be the right and more useful thing to do.
