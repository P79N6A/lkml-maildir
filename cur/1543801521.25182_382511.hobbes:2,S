Subject: [PATCH] ppc/boot: Put flush_{instruction,data}_cache back in .relocate_code section
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As part of the Great PowerPC Include Merge, the _GLOBAL() assembler
macro was changed to force code declared using _GLOBAL() to be in the
.text section.  As a result, two symbols defined in
arch/ppc/boot/common/util.S which are intended to be in the
.relocate_code section are being placed in .text instead, which causes
booting to fail.
There's another suspicious-looking usage at
arch/ppc/kernel/swsusp.S:37 (swsusp_save_area) that should be looked
into.  I did not exhaustively search the source tree, though.
This is the minimal patch that fixes the immediate problem.  I could
easily be convinced that the _GLOBAL macro should be modified to
remove the ".text;" line either instead of, or in addition to, this
fix.
