They're nice but they don't provide "cast checking", no?
The main purpose of the magic_* stuffs in ALSA is to check the cast of
the void pointer back to the original data type, which the compiler
can't check.
Maybe we can implement only this "magic" check separetly and get rid
of allocation checks, but I'm not sure whether it's worthy to do
that.
