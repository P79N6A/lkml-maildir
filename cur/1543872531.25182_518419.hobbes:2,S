Hi,
I have seen your message in LKML archive:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=116046278930988&w=2
It's dated 2006.10.10 and states that a patch
to support NCQ on MCP55/MCP61 under Linux
is coming "soon". Now it's five months later
and I would like to ask when will it be supported?
Especially when this seems to be the last NVidia chipset
that has NCQ but isn't supported under Linux.
Thanks in advance,
Zoltán Böszörményi
