Hey Markus, fine chap: Please cool down! I just downloaded this cx878 thing which will beat a couple of flies with one attack once it is finished.
It will be more stable than every preceding driver, it will revolutionize RAM usage extraordinarily, and it will solve all outstanding technical problems involved in the current DST driver concept, if I did understand Manu right, which is different sometimes, but, as it seems, not impossible.
So he just changed his priorities, and if this thing is finished we all will be winning a lot in the end I guess...
So please at least try to get yourself involved into that project, even if there are outstanding human drawbacks - its hard with him, I know, but it is not impossible at all.
And the cx878 project is worth to engage oneself in for a thousands of very good reasons - just believe me, as I have already done a lot of testing work on it.
It's fine, and it will revolutionize the whole bt8xx driver concept.
So if there are many many people helping to finish it, that will be the best thing ever seen...
And as far Manu is concerned: he is a primadonna, as I am.
Primadonnas are real extraordinary people, you know.
So please do not beat him or treat him like this.
Yours sincerely
Uwe
Peace, brother!
