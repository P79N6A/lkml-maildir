At that point you can dump the OSS interface just as well.
And before killing format conversion you should kill
the mmap stunt, because the format conversion complexity
(~25 LOC) is by far dwarfed by the mmap emulation stuff.
The underlying question is:
- do we want an usb audio driver that supports the OSS
  interface and with which most existing applications work
- or do we want a simple driver with its own non-OSS
  interface.
Anything in between is IMO silly. Killing the format
conversion drops the advantage of running many existing
applications but don't bring you much closer to the goal
of simplicity.
