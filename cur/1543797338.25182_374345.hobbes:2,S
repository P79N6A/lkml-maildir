I second Dmitry's request here. I can't seem to possibly build a valid
error path during device registration with the current API. Having
platform_device_del() would make it possible.
BTW, doesn't this suggest that the error path in
platform_device_register_simple() is currently broken as well? If
platform_device_add() fails therein, I take it that the resources
previously allocated by platform_device_add_resources() will never be
freed.
