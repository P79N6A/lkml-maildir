Hi Eric,
Sure. I will get rid if ELF note generation for bzImage ELF header.
But would that stop bootloaders out there from treating kernel as
an ELF executable?
I have got a FC5 machine with grub version .97 and everything seems
to work for me. So I am assuming that Andrew got a newer version of
Grub which is trying to load ther kernel as an ELF executable and then
running into the issues. 
Thanks
Vivek
