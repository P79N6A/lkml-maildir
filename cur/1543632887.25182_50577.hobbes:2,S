It seems to me that selectively limiting the number of processes in a
pgroup, or selectively killing large RSS programs in a large pgroup
(non-root) would be one way to identify the processes which were either
clone/fork looping, or have children begetting children. After than
perhaps killing or restricting from the high numerical uid down. That
might tend to spare system and/or well-behaved processes.
Comment?
