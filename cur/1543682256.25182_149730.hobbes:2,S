Thanks,
Compiling 07int now.
Oh, btw, I had a few starvation problems while testing 06int and mozilla.
I was able to get mozilla to livelock, and it's pri would stay at 15, and
badblocks run niced at 5 would get completely starved, no activity, or only
a few KB/s compared to the normal 40MB/s.  I think that even happened when
it was at nice 0, but I'm not sure.
Anyway, I'll be trying the same workload on 07int.
Mike
