Hi,
I have few questions on usage of "bio" in 2.5.X.
1) It is acceptable to use "bio" instead of "kio" for doing RAW IO
   and direct IO ? Currently, "kio" are getting converted to "bio"
   anywhy. why not use "bio" directly ?
   I am planning to do this. But I was wondering what are the issues
   here.
2) I don't see how to wait for a "bio" to complete. I don't see any
   wait_queue in bio structure. How can I wait for bio to complete ?
Please let me know.
Thanks,
Badari
