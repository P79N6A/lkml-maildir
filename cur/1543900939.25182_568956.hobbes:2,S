You can get this out of git annotate.  (Or in my case, hg annotate from 
http://kernel.org/hg/linux-2.6
 .)
Cleaning up Documentation is on my todo list, but for this month I'm trying to 
integrate the existing Documentation files with things like the OLS papers, 
linux journal articles, lwn.net kernel articles, man-pages, and so on into 
one big index.  (Indexing it requires reading large chunks of it.  My brain 
hurts.)
If there's interest, I can push some patches to clean up Documentation by 
moving files into subdirectories, but Documentation's not well-suited to link 
out to the web.  (You need html for that, and it's text.)
