Either that, or use a whole lot of #ifdefs, or hope that GNOME and KDE
agree on a common VFS, or don't use their VFS and just use the basic OS
calls and lose the functionality (and portability) of the VFSes, or pick
one VFS and hope that the other users can adapt.
GNOME and KDE already have their own VFS.  I am not asking for anything
new.  If you don't like the idea of a VFS at that level, take it up with
the GNOME and KDE people.

Of course.  It's probably slower than arranging the bits on the hard
drive directly, and hand-coding everything in assembly.  But there's
always a performance price to pay for maintaining the programmer's
sanity.  There's always a price to pay when writing cross-platform
stuff.
