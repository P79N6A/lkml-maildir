One quick question:

Looking at that interface, it appears that a process doing a read() on a
timerfd with no timer set will block for a very long time.  It's an
obvious "don't do that" situation, but perhaps we could help an
occasional developer get a clue by returning something like -EINVAL when
the timer has not been set?
