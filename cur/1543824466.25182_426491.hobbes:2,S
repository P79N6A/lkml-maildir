But it doesn't remove the need for the global counter. The
dcache_lock is far more heavily contended so the counter cacheline
bouncing is lost in the noise here. No to mention the counter can
only be updated while holding the dcache_lock.  Hence at this point,
adding per-sb counters is pure overhead unless the reclaim method
is made to use them.

The per-sb list improves scalability only by reducing the maximum
length of time the dcache_lock is held. Scalabilty for further
parallelism (and therefore better reclaim performance) is going to
require locking changes so that's when I'd expect the counters to
need changing. I don't want to over-optimise before we know what we
actually need to optimise...
Cheers,
Dave.
