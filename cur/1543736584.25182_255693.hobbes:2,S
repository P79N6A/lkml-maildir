No real reason, just laziness.  It's easier to change "0xc" to "0xb"
and not think rather than figuring out if 0xb8000000 will let me use
every last byte of RAM.  (I'm not sure if I end up with exactly 128 MB
of highmem, or perhaps a shade more)  For userspace, there's no
practical difference between having 2.75 GB of address space and 2.875
GB given that I have only 1 GB of real RAM.
