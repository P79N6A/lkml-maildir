The "not all" case is important. Especially since the potential causes
of being unable to find the root filesystem keep increasing with each
new capability.  And it isn't just failures involving finding the rootfs
that can be problematic to debug without more context than is on the
final screen image.

That might be useful for people who don't have support contracts. It
wouldn't help customer support teams like I'm a member of. We know what
those potential reasons are. The challenge is having enough context to
quickly determine which possible explanation accounts for the failure.
Ideally every customer would have a serial console configured. But a)
most customers don't/won't/can't configure one and b) on many systems a
serial console is not available.
