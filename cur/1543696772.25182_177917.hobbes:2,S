According to lmbench, 2.4 does a context switch in 0.67us (on one type
of uniprocessor cpu - the machines at osdl). 2.6.0-test9 manages 1.17us
(174% longer). I have some patches that brings this to 0.80us (119%).
This is with 2 active tasks, so O(1) doesn't get to show its advantage.
If you remove the realtime priority array (disable RT scheduling support)
you could probably drop this figure below 2.4's. I should get some numbers
Perhaps if there is demand I could make RT scheduling a config option in
my patchset. I think Andrea does something fancy like that. I'll have to
take a look at his code.
That said, I'd be inclined to think an application that it context switch
bound is broken by design. Although maybe there are some special cases.
