Actually, it was pretty simple. It was also my first module ever.
I had a lot of fun writing all of this stuff, but people keep
indicating that maybe some of it could actually be useful. If that's
the case, so much the better.
panictest.c follows.
--cut--
#define __KERNEL__
#define MODULE
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/init.h>
static char *string = "SOS SOS SOS";
int __init panic_init(void) {
	panic(string);
}
	
module_init(panic_init);
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_PARM(string, "s");
MODULE_PARM_DESC(string, "The string to panic with.");
