I guess you mean to use the CMOS clock for continuous timer, and TSC
for periodic timer?
OK, I'll take a look at it later this week or over the weekend.
Haven't looked at the x86 timer code for a while, but I think
I'll set up a new clock where we can just register a timer update
function and a periodic tick function. That way we can easily use 
whatever hardware timers are available.
