This ops is a unique object assigned to a different "id" string.
The first snd_seq_device_register_driver() called from emu10k1_synth.c
is the registration for the id "snd-synth-emu10k1".
Then in init_device(), the corresponding devices are initialized, and
one callback registers again another device for OSS sequencer with a
different id "snd-seq-oss" via snd_seq_device_new() inside the lock.
Now it hits the lock-detector but the lock should belong to a
different ops object in practice.
This nested lock may happen only in two drivers, emu10k1-synth and
opl3, and only together with OSS emulation.  Since the OSS emulation
layer don't do active registration from itself, no deadlock should
happen (in theory -- I may oversee something :)
