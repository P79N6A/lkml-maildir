Hi,
I have a PowerMac G5. (Newer Model with SMU).
It has a  Sungem ethernet with "PHY ID: 2060d2".
When this ethernet is connected to 
"Tigon3 [partno(BCM95704A6) rev 2002 PHY(5704)] " or
to the cisco switch, The PowerMac declares link up with
100 Mbs, while the other end declares link up  with 1000Mbs.
In this setup both end cannot ping each other.
If I lower the speed of Tigon based adapter or Cisco's switch
port to 100Mbs, both end can ping each other.
Is it a bug? or Am I missing something?
Thanks in advance for the help.
Ajay
