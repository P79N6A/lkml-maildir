Definitely not a waste of time - for driver issues where people like me
cannot even reproduce the thing at all (I have a ricoh controller myself,
and yenta and PS/2 mice work fine together) any amount of experimentation
is fine. I can only debug this by reading the source and the specs..
Reading sources and specs is how code should be developed in the first
place, but especially with drivers it often turns out that there are
gotchas that might not even be documented, or might just be so subtle that
you don't notice them. And when it happens only on a few machines, that
makes it really hard to test (provably the code is close enough to correct
that it works on many machines, but equally obviously there is _something_
wrong with it).
