My video card is a matrox G200SD, source is open. I will try another
video card tomorow.  I do understand that the kernel cannot prevent a
driver from locking then PCI bus : the timer lockup does not look like
a lock of the PCI bus (as SCSI and NIC are still working). Only the
timer interrupts and NMI seem to be stuck : can a driver cause
something so "lowlevel" ?
By the way, the processors are not overclocked.
I don't know how to check if something is overheating. Both fans seem okay
to me.
Do you any way to somehow "restart" (is it unmask ?) the timer IRQ
work and the NMI ? This would at least avoid some long fsck on
reboot...
Many thanks
