You can as well write a journaling data+metadata filesystem that does zero
copy if you accept file fragmentation on file changes. But if you need
zero copy at that cost then you'd better use logging filesystem that would
have less inode block allocation overhead (immediate function ;) and that
has the same fragmentation trouble (read-I/O potentially slower due
seeks).
