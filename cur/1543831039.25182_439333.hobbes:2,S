# for Jeff (in case you haven't read the other mails on the list): I've
possibly seen the same problem but I'm not sure.
Disabling preemtion seems to have fixed the problem for hamish, while I
haven't seen it anymore after a "cleanup":
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/28/333
# for Hamish: I suggest to keep running without preemption and maybe to
load the machine on purpose. If it survive for another week then
reenable preemption and see how it goes.
But maybe Jeff has some other suggestions :)
