And what can I do with these markers?
And once I've done it, are there any userspace applications I can use to
get the data out in human-usable form?
It seems to me that these patches aren't sequenced correctly - the kernel won't
build at each step of the patch sequence.  Maybe I'm mistaken in that.  We prefer
it this way so that people don't hit wont-compile points when doing bisection searches.
