I am running a dual processor pentium II system and have just
started getting the following errors:
kernel: stuck on TLB IPI wait (CPU#1)
last message repeated 156 times
When this occurs, the machine will be locked up tight with
no recourse but to reboot it.  Any ideas what the problem
is and how I can fix it ?  Thanks.
