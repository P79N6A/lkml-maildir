	Probably...  Yeah!  That might even cost you MORE space because
you would also include other libraries that are already somewhere else.
Or are you proposing a "partial static / partial dynamic" build?  Static
link with only those libraries you want to use in only that program and
dynamic link against all the rest?  I've tried that.  That's a butt
ugly build complication like you would not believe.
	Those floppies (and that includes the boot image on CD's which have
to fit the floppy footprint) are cronicly tight on space.  If making modutils
a C++ app means adding C++ libraries to the initrd boot floppy or forcing
a static linked modutils (which just means the libraries are in the executable
along with an extra copy of the standard libraries which are already on
the floppy elsewhere) this is the kiss of death for doing any of that
in C++!  Adding unneccesary cruft to the boot floppys is not an option.
	I've seen arguements for and against C++ for a variety of things.
This is one overwhelming arguement on the against side for anything that
comes near those tightly cramped little corners.
