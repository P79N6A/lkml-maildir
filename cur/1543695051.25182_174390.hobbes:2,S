	BTW, another thing that might be worth rechecking is the pile of bugs
related to ownership of ksymoops files.  In particular, bugs.debian.org/171947
might have been caused by the bug fixed in 2.4.23-pre8 (UID/GID leaking into
modprobe).  Matt, do you still see that crap appearing in /var/log/ksymoops
with that kernel?
