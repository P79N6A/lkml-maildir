Sorry, in -mm on x64 check_nmi_watchdog() has started to be run as a
late_initcall(). Currently it reports the NMIs as stuck on a few systems
although they are not, both of mine are reported as stuck. This appears
to be because the current event mask uses don't appear to tick much
running mdelay() on opteron (in my case). Also in -mm because nmi_hz is
set to 1 in setup_k7_watchdog() the NMI watchdog checking takes 10
seconds, a bit much.
Patch below uses RETIRED_UOPS for a more constant rate of NMI sending, 
this works well for me. However I'd like NMIs to maybe fire every fourth
second or so. Using nmi_mult to multiply nmi_interval() by 4 doesn't
seem to make it go every fourth second however, maybe every 1.5 second,
I'm puzzled about this...
