	Actually, I figured out what it was and I feel kind of stupid, and
suprised.  I knew I should have tried rebooting before complaining.  It
turns out it actually was something in my firewall rules, it appears that
for every logged packet there is something along the lines of a 100ms
delay that gets added on.
	Not sure if that is something that could be easily fixed or not, or
perhaps I'm doing something wrong, but that seems unlikely since all I
changed was if it jumped to the LOG chain or not.
