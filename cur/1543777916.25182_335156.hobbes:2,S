You are adding up all Shared_Clean and Shared_Dirty as Shared, right?

Each pair of address per line indicates the start and end address of a
memory area (VMA) such as:
b7f7d000-b7f7e000 
This means that an specific memory area start on virtual address 
b7f7d000 and end on b7f7e000 .
An mapped file like /lib/ld-2.3.3.so is organized in different memory
areas. The memory area can be a text section, data section or bss. So
it is normal you find the same filename mapped in more than one memory
area.
You can find more information about VMA on Linux Kernel Development
book (chapter 14) written by Robert Love.
For instance:

This is a text section.

This should be a data section.
IMHO, bss section corresponds to the anonymous area where the mapping
is not backed by a file.
