Those messages are "normal" for an ATAPI drive.
hdparm first tries the IDENTIFY opcode (0xec), and if that fails (above)
it then tries the PACKET_IDENTIFY opcode (0xa1), which should work for ATAPI.
I'm not sure why the "failed: Input/output error" (-EIO) result is
being returned from the ATA layer in this case.  Driver bug, most likely.
Cheers
