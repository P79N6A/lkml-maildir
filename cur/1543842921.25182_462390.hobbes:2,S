What do you mean? I thought returning the error code was enough.

They do 8)
#define PRINTK_PREFIX PRINTK_INFO NAME ": "
printk(PRINTK_PREFIX "Init... ");
Then, if a error appears: printk("ERROR - kmalloc\n");
Final string: "<i>cfag12864b: Init... ERROR - kmalloc"
The only bad point: If some other printk is called from other module
between. Should I change it?
