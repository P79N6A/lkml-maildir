How queue lock can synchronize them if we do not hold queue lock
for entire duration and setup of request, including drive->srequest 
setup?

For example do_cmd_ioctl() invokes ide_raw_taskfile, without any locking.
Two programs, both issuing HDIO_DRIVE_CMD at same time, will compete
over one drive->srequest struct: you'll get same drive->srequest structure
submitted twice to blk_insert_request (hm, Jens, will this trigger
BUG, or will this just damage request list?).
