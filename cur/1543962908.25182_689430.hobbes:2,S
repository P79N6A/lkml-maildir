Hi Linus,
   I'm trying to figure out how you did this.  So fedora builds unversioned 
modules, and version (and vermagic) matched your kernel?  And you somehow 
mixed them up?
   I don't think relying on modversions is the complete answer here.  Perhaps 
we should make modules_install blow away old modules?
Cheers,
Rusty.
