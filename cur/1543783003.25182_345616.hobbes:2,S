There will be some compile errors in cases where compilation previously 
worked because the undefined function wasn't called due to gcc dead code 
elimination.
We need to fix some code, but I'd strongly prefer this over the possible 
runtime errors -Werror-implicit-function-declaration prevents in other 
cases.
