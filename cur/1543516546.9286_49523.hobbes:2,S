Following months of coding, tweeking and lots of coffee, there's
now a new release of the Linux Trace Toolkit, 0.9.0. The following
is a summary of the added features :
- Complete instrumentation of the kernel.
- Compile-time option for kernel-support for tracing.
- Configurabilty of the trace driver. Including the ability to
choose which types of events to trace and to what degree of detail.
- Extended configurability of the trace daemon in accordance with
the configurability of the trace driver.
- Lots of enhancements to the GUI front-end of LTT, including toolbar,
icons for the trace graph, per-event menus, and many others.
- Experimental support for SMP.
- System analysis is much more advanced with details such as how
much time each runing process looses waiting for I/O.
- Help files.
- Updated patches for most recent kernels.
- Lots of other things ...
Now remember, you still get to see exactly all the events occuring
on a system, in the order and detail of their occurrence. Moreover,
you now get more detail, more configurability and the front-end
is much nicer to play around with. Most importantly, you can get
information no other tool is able to provide (Like the exact time
runing a task, not the estimated one as currently available through
/proc, the time a task spends waiting for I/O, and real system call
latency, not the sampled one as in gprof.) Everything with a total
system overhead of below 1.5% !

The above page contains more detail, screenshots, documentation
than a mail can carry ...
Thank you for your time and hope to hear from you soon!
