Yes,
with ACPI turned on etc. now it no longer hangs on ifconfig (or at first 
use), and I am succesfully linked up and transferring files. I havn't 
done any huge tests but so far so good. This is with HT, SMP, ACPI, 
apic, all enabled. Incidentally now /proc/interrupts is showing better:
 > 18:    5    0  IO-APIC-level  libata, eth0
 > 23:    0    0  IO-APIC-level  libata
(of course, this is just after reboot)
