Hmmm...so I guess the only viable solution for a single test to cover as
many archs as possible, is to explicitly define the number for each arch.
Here's how I would do it Aniruddha:
------------------------------------------
#ifdef __i386__
#define __NR_timer_create 259
#endif
#ifdef __x86_64__
#define __NR_timer_create 222
#endif
#if defined(__ppc__) || defined(__ppc64__)
#define __NR_timer_create 240
#else /* Not defined on this architecture */
#include "test.h"
#include "usctest.h"
int TST_TOTAL = 0;      /* Total number of testcases */
int main()
{
  tst_resm(TCONF,"This system call is not defined for this architecture.");
  tst_exit();
  /* NOT REACHED */
  return(0);
}
#endif /* Not defined on this architecture */
<REST OF TEST HERE>
------------------------------------------
Any comments???

No. Linux has traditionally used different syscall numbers for different
architectures. The original ports (alpha etc.) always used the syscall
numbers
of the "native" Unix, so the numbering was often completely different.
Newer ports who weren't concered about such compatibility often did
a renumbering too. For example x86-64 has a completely new
"cache line optimized" ordering.
What should work on most architectures is
(most = someone told me it doesn't work properly on IA64)
#include </path/to/kernel/source/include/asm-<arch>/unistd.h>
(you need the version in the kernel source because many glibc packagers
in their infinite wisdom use an old outdated copy of asm/ usually from
the last stable kernel only)
_syscallN(...)
