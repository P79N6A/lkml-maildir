Ok. Then go away.
Everybody else just cares about the legal reasons.
The "legal terms" is the only reason a license *exists*. That's what a 
license *is*, for crying out loud!
If you don't care about the legal side, go and read the free software 
manifesto. That's the paper you're really arguing about.
If you want to argue about the GPLv2 *license*, then you'd better start 
caring about the legal issues. Because that is what the license is: a 
_legal_ document.
