We should not include this driver in the kernel.
Rather than adding additional platform-specific drivers,
we should be migrating away from those that we already have
to simpler generic drivers for video and hot-keys -- where
the platform-dependent (naming) is done in user-space where
it is more extensible and supportable.
We've already got video.c, and I believe that we should start
to migrate to something like Luming's hot-key driver (see
earlier acpi-devel posts) in 2.6.12.
If a platform has some unique feature that no other platform
in the world has, then that justifies a platform specific driver
for that unique feature.  But for the common features, the
community will be better served by the simpler generic kernel
drivers that work on more systems.
thanks,
