I pulled. However, I think the Kconfig changes are HORRIBLE.
I don't understand why people don't use "select" more. Why should Kconfig 
ask for "Generic HID support?" That question _never_ makes sense to a 
user. And if you answer "n", you'll not get USB_HID.
This is not user-friendly. If you need HID support, just select it. Don't 
ask people questions that make no sense. If the generic HID code is needed 
for some driver, you just select it. If it's not needed, you don't. It's 
that easy.
