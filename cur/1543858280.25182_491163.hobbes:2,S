So it's a SATAPI device of type 0 ... that's fun ... but it still needs
a blacklist; it's governed by SBC which isn't ambiguous about the need
to support REPORT LUNS.  Now, if it supported RBC instead of SBC, that's
different; RBC also makes REPORT LUNS optional.  However, it is required
to indicate RBC support by being type 0xe.
