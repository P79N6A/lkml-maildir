 Well, if I understand correctly the code in these devices relies on full
decoding of the data coming from the mice, right ?
 If yes, this supports my opinion that unless kernel handles all
communication from the mouse the reconnect should not be performed.
 Alan - would you agree with introducing a command line switch to enable 
reconnect behaviour ?
