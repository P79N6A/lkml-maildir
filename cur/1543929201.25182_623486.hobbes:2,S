Take a look at mm/slub.c around line 2560, in __kmalloc:
        if (unlikely(size > PAGE_SIZE / 2))
                return (void *)__get_free_pages(flags | __GFP_COMP,
                                                        get_order(size));
So it seems that kmalloc simply returns pages from the page allocator
in this case. Therefore no SLUB metadata will be available for the
allocation.
The error of ksize() seems to be that it does not check if the
allocation was made by SLUB or the page allocator. Maybe something
like this will fix it? (completely untested)

It's going to round up, though, so you would get ksize(kmalloc(2049))
= PAGE_SIZE.
