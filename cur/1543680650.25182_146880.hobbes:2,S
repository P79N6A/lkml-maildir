I stole the configurable PAGE_OFFSET code from Andrea, made it work with
partial kernel pmds, and stuck it in Martin's tree.  There are several
parts to it, and I'm not sure which ones you got.

Here's the 2.5 patch to do the configuration: 
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mbligh/patches/2.5.73/2.5.73-mjb1/102-config_page_offset
You'll have to adapt the arch/i386/Kconfig stuff to 2.4, but there's a
good example of it here:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.21rc8aa1/00_3.5G-address-space-5
(which is where I stole the code from to begin with)
Instead of changing _all_ of the loops which touch PMDs, I suggest you
clean it up inside of the pmd function themselves.  All of these are
confusing:
+		if (start + PGDIR_SIZE < start)
+			break;
