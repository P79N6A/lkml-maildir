The proposal has get_lowres_timeofday() which does just that, although
for timer stuff, I would guess monotonic_clock() or
get_lowres_timestamp(), which returns the number of (ntp adjusted)
nanoseconds the system has been running, would be better.

I'm not sure about the busy wait bit, but yes, at some point I'd like to
see the timer subsystem use the timeofday subsystem instead of jiffies
for its timekeeping.
