"loop=DEV" is special, we've already talked about that.
For example if we have an mtab entry like this:
  /dir/foo.iso /mnt/image ext3 rw,loop=/dev/loop/0 0 0
It says: /dev/loop/0 has been automatically set up by mount(8) from
/dir/foo.iso and so needs to be torn down by umount(8).  It is not a
property of the mount, rather the property of the device.
So what we really want is a file to store this, and only this info:
/var/lib/mount/loop:
/dev/loop/0 /dir/foo.iso
/dev/loop/2 /dir/bar.img
...
Notice, there's nothing about the _mountpoint_ in this file.

The problem with storing mount options in userspace is that
unprivileged mounts/umounts won't work in the presense of those, we
cannot _force_ an unprivileged user to update a file.
So we want to avoid storing options in userspace as long as possible.
