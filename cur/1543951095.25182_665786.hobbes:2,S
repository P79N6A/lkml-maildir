Yes, I was surprised about the pgd page allocation.  It's currently 
necessary for Xen (but I think I can fix that easily enough).  But I was 
especially surprised it was imposed for everyone.

+1.  We'd still need to maintain a list to link all the pgds together, 
but I think we can just allocate that out of the cache too (either the 
same object or a separate pgd list cache).

I think only Xen has a constraint.  At the moment we rely on page-sized 
pgds for two things:
   1. Xen marks the whole page as being of pgd-type, and so it can't
      have non-pgd contents (as the page would be RO, and any contents
      would be validated as pgd entries).  However I can fix that by
      maintaining a separate per-cpu pgd page, and just copy the four
      entries over when cr3 is reloaded.  This would move the
      Xen-specific requirements into the Xen code without affecting the
      rest of the kernel.
   2. We still need to maintain a list of pgds, as I discussed above.
So from my perspective there are no insoluble problems, and I'd fully 
support the transition.
I've been working on unifying the pgalloc stuff, and the quicklist 
(i386) vs non-quicklist (x86-64) use has been a bit of a thorn in my 
side.  Of course there'll still be the page-sized pgd vs non-page-sized 
pgd, but we just have to live with that.
