It's not just the nice command. There's a syscall
interface you know, and lots of apps use it.
#include <unistd.h>
int nice(int inc);
You planning to hack ALL those apps? You'll
convince BSD-centric developers to include
this Linux-specific change?
Besides, the kernel load average was changed to
include processes waiting for IO. It just plain
makes sense to mix CPU usage with IO usage by
default. Wanting different niceness for CPU
and IO is a really unusual thing.
