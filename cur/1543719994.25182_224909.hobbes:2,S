The existing external modules are anyway broken when using separate 
directories for source and output directories. So noting lost here.
In the case where the kernel is build in the traditional way
the build and source tree will point to the same place.
So I do not see this patch breaking existing setups, but I see
external modules not being prepared for separate build and source
directories.
Patch looks good to me, and I will forward to Andrew soon.
