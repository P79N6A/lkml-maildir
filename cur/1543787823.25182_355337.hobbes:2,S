hi ben ,
I tried to apply 2.6.13-rc6-B0/B1-all.diff to
linux-2.6.13 kernel with arm support patches . It's
getting applied cleanly...
but while building the kernel i am getting some build
errors ... 
i traced the problem and get that this error are
coming because of some machine specific files.
1)arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c
2)include/asm-i386/seamphore.h
So can you please tell me that whather any patch is
available, in order to support these implementation on
arm platform.
Or any development is going on in this direction 
Thanks in advance
Vikas
