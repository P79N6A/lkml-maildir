Besides, the code doesn't actually depend on not re-initializing the 
pointers, it depends on the _forward_ pointers still being walkable in 
case some other CPU is traversing the list just as we remove the entry.
Which means that I think the proper patch is to (a) document this and also
(b) poison the back pointer.
A patch like the attached, in short.
