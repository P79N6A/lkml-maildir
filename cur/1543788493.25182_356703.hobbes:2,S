That will end up being far more intrusive than this version and __alloc_pages 
would need more tests that affect every call to __alloc_pages which seems 
much more expensive to me than exporting buffered_rmqueue and 
zone_statistics, and the modified __alloc_pages will still be a much more 
complicated function than prefetch_get_page.
