Hi all,
	Doing per-cpu cleanups: everyone except ia64 and x86_64 use
the generic irq_stat_t macros.  There are two obvious ways to go: one
is to simply use per-cpu macros directly (nice and clean), the other
is to rework the softirq_pending() etc macros (adding
local_softirq_pending()) to use per-cpu everywhere except your two
platforms, which means callers need to disable preemption explicitly
(get_* and put* versions of the macros seems overkill).
	The motivation is that accessing irq_stat_t is one of the main
reasons for smp_processor_id() etc.
Thoughts?
Rusty.
