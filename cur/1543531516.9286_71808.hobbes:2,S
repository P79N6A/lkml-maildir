A few q's concerning 2.3.99, arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:
- __setup_APIC_LVTT() is altering bits in the LVTT register which
24319202.pdf says are reserved:
SET_APIC_TIMER_BASE(APIC_TIMER_BASE_DIV).
   Where could I find the documentation for these bits?
   If they are defined for later processors, is this
   usage safe for older processors?
- When the SMP kernel is run on a UP, the APIC is disabled (APIC_SPIV:8
== 0).  This causes calibrate_APIC_clock() to return zero and a number
of things which should be non-zero end up being zero.  This isn't a
problem - just something to keep an eye on.
- calibrate_APIC_clock() will get a divide-by-zero if someone sets (HZ <
10)...
- Where could I find docs for the IO-APIC?
Thanks.
