While we're mucking around in this area, there is another thing which we 
should eventually get around to fixing:
we need a set of page tables with an identity mapping as well as the 
kernel mapping, for trampolining (during startup, but also during things 
like ACPI suspend/resume.)  Right now, we let those be the swapper page 
tables, but that's probably not really a good idea, since it can hide bugs.
