On 64 bits platform, unsigned long isn't the same as unsigned long long ?
Do you mean there will be a warning ?
But pnp_printf is a variadic fonction (with no attribute format printf), 
so gcc can't check the arguments type.

PS : according to arch/ppc/Kconfig, ISA (so PNP that depend on ISA) 
could be enable on PPC_PREP or PPC_CHRP [1]. But there are others 64 
bits architecture like ia64 that have ACPI and use PNP.

Find out whether you have ISA slots on your motherboard.  ISA is the
           name of a bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other 
stuff
           inside your box.  If you have an Apple machine, say N here; 
if you
           have an IBM RS/6000 or pSeries machine or a PReP machine, say 
Y.  If
           you have an embedded board, consult your board documentation.
