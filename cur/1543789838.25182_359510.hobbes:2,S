first i am very sorry if it isnt the place to ask questions like this
but i didnt know where else to ask ( i tryed irc channels and i was
send from there to this list )
anyway:
does this following code look buggy? :
DECLARE_WAITQUEUE ( wait , current );
add_wait_queue ( q , &wait );
while ( !condition ) {
set_current_stat ( TASK_INTERRUPTABLE ); i
if ( signal_pending ( current ) )
/* handle signal */
schedule ( ); }
set_current_state ( TASK_RUNNING );
remove_wait_queue ( q , &wait );
first:doesnt in the way from checking the !condition to
set_current_state  the condition can be changed no?
second:why not putting the schedule ( ); right after the
set_current_state ( ) , what the point in checking the if (
signal_pending ( ) first, if the proccess doesnt started to sleep yet?
third: in the cleaning in the way from putting the set_current_state (
TASK_RUNNING ) into remove_wait_queue , cant the queue wait list ( q )
wake up again the wait procsess?
( thnks for the help , please if it can be done answer quickly i am
tanker in the idf and need to come back to the army soon , ( no
internet there... ) )
thnks!
