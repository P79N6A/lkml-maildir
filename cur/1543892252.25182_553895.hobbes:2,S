ext2 is a multi-purpose block based filesystem and you add support for
another bit of storage.  cramfs is very specialized to storing read-only
compressed data on block devices.  The embedded people already use them
on flash which is a little dumb, but now we add even more cludge for
a non-block based access.
The right way to architect xip for flash-based devices is to implement
a generic get_xip_page for mtd-based devices and integrate that into
an existing flash filesystem or write a simple new flash filesystem
tailored to that use case.
