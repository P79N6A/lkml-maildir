One bad reason is given above. Should I look for another one?

You are right!

No no. (Yes!)
I had some doubts about this, and you found very good reason
for this.
I'll soon send a patch to restore cancel_rearming_delayed_work
in 2.6.22.
So, 2.6.21 needs something better (maybe you've found it btw.?),
but they weren't too interested, anyway.
Thanks very much & regards,
