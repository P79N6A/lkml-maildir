(no maintainer for proc listed in MAINTAINERS)
[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
/proc/uptime overrun, resetting uptime counter to 0
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
uptime is stored in an unsigned long int in fs/proc/proc_misc.c (around
line 121), set from jiffies defined in include/sched.h. 
On systems available to me, HZ is always 100, which makes this value 
overrun the unsigned long after about 497 days.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
kernel, proc
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
found on a 2.4.12, but apparently still there in 2.4.19
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information 
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
(no oops)
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
#!/bin/sh
sleep 498d
cat /proc/uptime
[7.] Environment
(not considered relevant)
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
No, I don't consider this very important. However, the wrong uptime
display may trigger a search for a power failure or system compromise.
Did for me.
