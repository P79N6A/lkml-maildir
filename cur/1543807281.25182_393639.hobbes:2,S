This consolidation patch looks ok to me on first read, though others
are certainly more expert in this code than I am.  Certainly cleanup,
ifdef reduction and consolidation of mm/slab.c is a worthwhile goal.
That code is rough for folks like me to follow.
Two issues I can see:
  1) This patch increased the text size of mm/slab.o by 776
     bytes (ia64 sn2_defconfig gcc 3.3.3), which should be
     justified.  My naive expectation would have been that
     such a source code consolidation patch would be text
     size neutral, or close to it.
  2) You might want to hold off this patch for a few days,
     until the dust settles from my memory spread patch.
