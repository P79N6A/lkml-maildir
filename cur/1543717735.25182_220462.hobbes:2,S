Well, I wonder what IRIX does?  They support capabilities and had a
reasonable sized hand in the draft.  No point in making it impossible
to port apps.  It's not that I'm a strong fan of Posix caps, but
compatibility (even with a partially complete draft) with defacto
standards is not entirely unreasonable.
