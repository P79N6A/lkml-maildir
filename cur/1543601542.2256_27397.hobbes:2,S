BTW, what's to stop shrink_cache() from picking a page out of ramdisk
pagecache and calling ->writepage() on it?  The thing will immediately
get dirtied again, AFAICS (blkdev_writepage() -> submit_bh() -> ... ->
rd_make_request() -> rd_blkdev_pagecache(WRITE,...) -> SetPageDirty()).
If you get a lot of stuff in ramdisks, things can get rather insteresting...
