The page might even be on disk. 
The sound drivers may be the most instructive example here. They
DMA to/from buffers and a program can handle them but what is done is
	kernel allocates buffers
	marks the pages reserved
process does mmap
	pages are mapped into application space
interrupt occurs
	interrupt handler writes to the kernel address
Those pages being kernel space are always available, but via mmap also
part of the user space
