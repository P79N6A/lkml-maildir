Apart from the DRAC3, some home-made Sun-to-PS2 converter, and a single
non-x86 embedded box, I don't recall anything. Answer: very few.
There may be users, though, that use this option to force the detection
of the keyboard when not really plugged in, eg. for flaky KVMs. I've
Googled for that usage, but found none.

We could, but the more I think about it, the stronger I'm convinced that
the dumbkbd => softrepeat => softraw option implication chain is wrong.
The second implication is necessary, but with dumbkbd it's quite likely
you won't want softraw.
