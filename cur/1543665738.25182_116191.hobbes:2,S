Keep in  mind the date here.   Prior to this time,  subroutines were the
packaging  technique  of choice  to  promote  "software reuse":  i.  e.,
reference the _same_  code in various places throughout  a program.  K&P
were espousing a  fundamental shift in thinking by  using subroutines as
functional  abstractions.  Using  your  argument that  the example  code
hides an "implementation", it's difficult  to conceive of a code example
that hids neither its data nor its implementation.
I'd suggest an alternate tack:
        "When you are deep in the programming 'zone' and code is flowing
        from  your fingertips  and you  are  amazed at  the insight  and
        understanding evidenced by your code:
        STAND UP!  MOVE AWAY FROM THE KEYBOARD!  GO HOME!
        Look at the code again tomorrow and see if it makes any sense to
        you then."
