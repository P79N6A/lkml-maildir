Hmm, since it IS critical that the ssh and VPN keys of a new system be
very good, you could do something like run "bonnie++" on one of the new
partitions, until you get enough entropy from block I/O completions.
Alternately, you could generate "weak" keys on the client using urandom
just to get ssh working, and then send keys generated on the server (which
presumably has more real entropy) to replace the weak keys.
That said, there are still cases where network traffic _has_ to be enough
for /dev/random, given that some firewalls (e.g. LRP) can run from only
ramdisk, so have no other source of entropy than the network traffic.
Cheers, Andreas
