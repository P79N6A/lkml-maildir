I would agree with you, except that the one time I had init die on me (it
got hit by the 2.2.5 out-of-memory bug) the system stayed up.  And I believe
it did generate a core dump.
IIRC your problem had to do with sysrq killall - maybe that's different?  in
particular, sysrq sync is handled by kflushd, if it's dead it won't do
anything.
(time to go experiment...)
