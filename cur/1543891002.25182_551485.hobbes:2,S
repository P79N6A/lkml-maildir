There could be other users of perfctrs too, message is a bit misleading.
And why are multiple reserved counters not supported?

Hmm you're trying to detect what the main kernel does? But if it's
merged it should know. So trying to detect it dynamically doesn't 
seem appropiate.

It seems a bit ingenious that when Intel does all the trouble
to define cpuid bits for them and then you do such checks anyways. 
There should be probably two levels: simple support for the 
architected counters using only cpuid capability bits 
and then an exnteded check for known models etc
(probably table driven)

That's not necessarily true for !SMP.  e.g. consider the kdump
case.

Non blocking way to aquire a resource? Looks unreliable.

Can you please explain what this complex northbridge access control
logic is good for? There are a few shared counters, but normally
this can be easier handled by limitting access to one of the cores.
I suspect this could be done much simpler.

But we don't necessarily know the phys_proc_id of all possible CPUs.
So that seems broken for the cpu hotplug case.

Already obsolete with Barcelona and Griffin (16 and 17) but very similar
counters.
