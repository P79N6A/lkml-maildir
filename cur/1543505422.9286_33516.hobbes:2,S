I wasn't (intentionally) refering to the existing set of patches. What
I want is working nfs in the kernel, without having to apply various
patches from various places... First stop should be working nfs2,
which means merging the various patches and solutions out there. I'm
not an nfs-expert, but if I have understood matters correctly nfs2 is
a bad design and nfs3 is "nfs done right". So why not try to get it
right as soon as possible ? Atleast I would like to see experimental
nfs3-support in 2.4 ...

I don't underestimate the work done (if I did then I would probably be
more stupid then I am ;) but it seems to me that more work needs to be
done in this area. It's also funny that none of the companies
announcing Linux-support have claimed that they want to import nfs
interoperability ...

They are definately not harmless (yet), but the nfs3 client-support
works better for us than the existing nfs2-support in 2.2.11 (in terms
of file-corruption). That's what I know, since I'm on the "user-side"
in this matter...
With some hard work it should be possible to put nfs3 client-support
in a useable state. I'm not that sure about the server-nfs3 though,
since it was doing more than one stupid thing when we tried it ;)

Well, Irix 6.5.4 may be silly but it's definately not old...
