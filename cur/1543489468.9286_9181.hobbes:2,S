I think, it's time to lay down the weapons, this round is lost for the
BE folks. Let's hope and work for better opens source debugging tools on
every platform, which support us mortals getting around those LE/BE problems.
As a metter of fact, we all stick to some modern form of hinduism:
We cannot slaughter holy cows. This one's called compatibility.
It ain't 1992 any more! Time to open our minds towards the new millenium.
