I'm not exactly familiar with asynchronous block device, but I'm
guessing that it would need to get its crypto keys from the user
somehow, no?  If so, then the best way of managing them is via
the key/keyring infrastructure.  From the point of view of other
kernel systems, it's basically a set of BLOB<=>task associations
that supports a reasonable inheritance and permissions model.
