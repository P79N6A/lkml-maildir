 If someone posts something to vendor-sec that says "please tell Linus"
we would. If someone posts to vendor-sec saying "I posted this to
linux-kernel here's a heads up" its useful. If you are uber cool elite 0
day disclosure weenie you post to full-disclosure or bugtraq. There are
alternatives 8)

I'm all for an open list too. Its currently called linux-kernel. Its
full of such reports, and most of them are about new code or trivial
holes where secrecy is pointless. Having an open linux-security list so
they don't get missed as the grsecurity stuff did (and until I got fed
up of waiting the coverity stuff did) would help because it would make
sure that it didn't get buried in the noise.
Similarly it would help if you are sneaking security fixes in (as you do
regularly) you actually told the vendors about them.
