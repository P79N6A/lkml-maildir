I have no problem with doing fancy new fairness classes and things.
But considering that we _need_ to have per-thread fairness and that
is also what the current scheduler has and what we need to do well for
obvious reasons, the best path to take is to get per-thread scheduling
up to a point where it is able to replace the current scheduler, then
look at more complex things after that.
