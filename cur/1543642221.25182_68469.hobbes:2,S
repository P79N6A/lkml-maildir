I'm not sure what you're after here?  Strategy is to make the locks per-zone,
per-node, to not take them too long, to not take them too frequently, to do
as much *needed* work as possible for a single acquisition of the lock and
to not do unnecessary work while holding it - and that includes not servicing
ethernet interrupts.
Not having to bump page counts when moving pages from the LRU into a private
list would be nice.
The strategy for fixing the double-free race is to wait until you
buy an IDE disk ;)
