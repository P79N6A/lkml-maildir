John, I did not see your posts until this had already made it out.
I would think that the folks running realtime applications would expect
udelay to hold off for even shorter periods of time.  I would expect
something along the line of 20 or 25 uSec.

How much drift would you expect from this?  I have not tried this, but
what about something more along the lines of:
#define MAX_USECS_WHILE_NOT_PREMPTIBLE	20
void
udelay (unsigned long usecs)
{
	unsigned long next, timeout;
	long last_processor = -1;
	/*
	 * Execute the non-preemptible delay loop (because the ITC might
	 * not be synchronized between CPUS) in relatively short time
	 * chunks, allowing preemption between the chunks.
	 */
	while (usecs > 0) {
		next = min(usecs, MAX_USECS_WHILE_NOT_PREMPTIBLE);
		preempt_disable;
		if (last_processor != smp_processor_id()) {
			last_processor = smp_processor_id();
			timeout = ia64_get_itc();
		}
		timeout += next * local_cpu_data->cyc_per_usec;
		while (ia64_get_itc() < timeout)
			cpu_relax();
		preempt_enable;
		usecs -= next;
	}
}
