Hello.
I am about to modify a Linux v2.2.x-compatible Ethernet driver to allow it to
work in the new v2.4.x kernel.  Are there any documents which describe the
differences in the device driver models (particularly PCI and Ethernet) of the 2
kernel versions?  If so, where can I find them?
Thank you.
