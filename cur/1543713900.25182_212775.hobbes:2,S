 First I used the patch to defer all softirq's to ksoftirq with call_rcu_bh()
 patch. Sofar this has been the best combination giving both pure sofirq 
 performance and also good response from the userland apps.
 I also tried other TCP apps netperf and could note any performance 
 degradation which I was expecting.

 Certainly. I said to Dipankar we should not expect all overflows to disappear
 the setup I use now. But the call_rcu_bh() patch improved things so it cured 
 some latency caused by RCU. But I don't think we can do much better now in 
 terms dst overflow.

 From /proc
 gc_min_interval = 0
 max_size = 262144
