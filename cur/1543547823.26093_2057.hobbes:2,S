In NetWare, the webserver does run in-kernel.  It's got the highest
numbers for any web server on the planet on Intel.  Visit
www.novell.com.  I don't plan to put the MANOS webserver in-kernel, BTW,
but I mention this in anwswer to your question.  Microsoft's web server
appears to run in user space, but in fact, does not, BTW  -- they have
half of it down in-kernel as well for performance.
