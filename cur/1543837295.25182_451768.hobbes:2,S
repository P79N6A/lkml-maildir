I should probably mention that I've been bitten by e2fsck before.
I had a filesystem with minor damage, but after running e2fsck it was
completely nuked.
Nothing was recoverable.
So before anyone suggest running e2fsck, I'd really like someone
knowledgeable to tell me what e2fsck is going to do about "group
descriptors corrupted" *BEFORE* I go ahead and blindly run it.
