I am far more interested in the API, including the shape
of the data model, that we present to the user across the
kernel-user boundary.
Getting one, good, stable API for the long haul is worth alot.
Whether or not some substantial semantic change in this, such
as going from a flat to a tree shape, can be done in a single
line of kernel code, or a thousand lines, is less important.
What is the right long term kernel-user API and data model?
