I just tested again (with 2.6.24-rc2-gecd744ee). If I only load the 'ac'
kernel module and not the 'battery' kernel module, then the system boots
fine. However, if I load the 'battery' module during boot or later, I
still get the oops.
I am running 2.6.24-rc2-gecd744ee right now, but without the battery
module. I am forwarding this to the ACPI list as well.
