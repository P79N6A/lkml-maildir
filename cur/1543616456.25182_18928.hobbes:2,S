Hmm.  It worked fine for me.  I made it a module, and it put it into 
kernel/lib in
/lib/modules/2.4.17 and it did not put it in lib/lib.a  I make it a 
non-module, and
it gets included in lib/lib.a. My diff was the same as yours for the 
Makefile.
I don't know about the bootloaders.  I'm not sure you can make the 
requirement
to have them compiled the same as the kernel, since they may have different
compilation requirements in the boot loader.

The problem is that if you come along later and compile a new module that
needs it, it won't work.  That's a fairly common thing I do, I expect 
other kernel
developers do the same.  And the dummy ref thing is a little ugly.

Yeah, I agree, it was just a random thought that occured to me.
