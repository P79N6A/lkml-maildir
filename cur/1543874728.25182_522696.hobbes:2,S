Hi folks,
I plugged my iPod nano 8 GB in and got this message with 2.6.21-rc4:
hub 1-0:1.0: over-current change on port 1
along with other USB error messages. I tried a hub with own power
supply and a USB port on the computer. A full log is attached.
When I boot with 2.6.20, it works:
usb 1-5.1: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 13
usb 1-5.1: configuration #1 chosen from 2 choices
scsi5 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
usb-storage: device found at 13
usb-storage: waiting for device to settle before scanning
scsi 5:0:0:0: Direct-Access     Apple    iPod             1.62 PQ: 0
ANSI: 0
SCSI device sdc: 3964928 2048-byte hdwr sectors (8120 MB)
Is the over-current message an indication that the hardware does bad
things, or is this a .21-rc4 bug?
Regards,
Tino
