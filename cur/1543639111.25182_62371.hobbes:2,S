Tyan Tiger (2466) v1.02
3ware 7850 (software revision 7.5)
3C996B-T (runs with 33Mhz, don't know why)
2*Athlon MP 1900+
kernel 2.4.19 vanilla
The script to reproduce this copies simultanously from the disk to the 
network and back. Be sure to really hit the disk: 800MB did not show the 
error in my case, if all was in RAM.
Ciao,
