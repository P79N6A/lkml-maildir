If everything worked before as a module, this works still.  If not, you
need to have a for loop or something that attempts to load every XXX
subsystem driver.
But the point I was getting at is the 100% solution isn't possible.
Even if we narrow the scope of the problem to just x86 hardware, theres
still things which can't be solved.  Talking to random memory locations
will bite you at somepoint on some hw.  Old busses weren't designed with
any sort of autoconfig in mind.
