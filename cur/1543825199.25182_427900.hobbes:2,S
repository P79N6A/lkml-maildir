The linux driver is for the MAC, which is in the chipset.  The PHY is
external, and it doens't particularly matter which one it is in general.
The driver almost never has to care.  I know I don't have to tell the
pcnet32 driver that I am using a broadcom 5221 PHY with it.  It works
just fine because the MAC is an AMD 972 which is one fo the chips the
pcnet32 driver operates.
