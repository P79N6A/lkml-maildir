Well, some buggy programs don't care about you turning off beeping in
X.  I think gnome-terminal or such has its own checkbox for turning
beeps on or off. 
I still agree that this is fixing userspace bugs in the kernel, and
probably not desirable, even if I think I'd disable the pc speaker if
the kernel actually asked me.  If nothing else, I figure it would make
my kernel 0.5k or so smaller  ;)
