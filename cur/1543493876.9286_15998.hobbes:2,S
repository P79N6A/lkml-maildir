I use the BusLogic BT958 on most all of my machines. I have had
zero (0) problems with it and its driver. So I don't think your
problem is the SCSI Controller. However, I do not use IDE anything.
Once I tried to put a CD-ROM on IDE on this machine. A disaster
occurred when I tried to copy some files from the CD-ROM to a SCSI-
Disk. The disaster was so complete that there were not any "known"
file-systems left on the machine. The contents of all four SCSI
disks were completely trashed, having been overwritten with a
pattern of "|||||||||||||" (forever).
I suggest you do not use an IDE disk with SCSI. There seems to
be something about IDE that doesn't "like" SCSI boards. I didn't
bother to investigate why.
Cheers,
