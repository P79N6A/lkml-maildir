I should pay more attention to what goes on in 2.6.  That was a crap
decision.  There are drivers out there that use global data and need one
lock across all controllers.  Putting a lock in the scsi host struct for
per controller locks is a waste of space.  Let the driver decide if it
needs a global driver lock, a per controller lock (in which case it
should be part of the driver private host struct), or just the global
io_request_lock.  It really is up to the driver and putting it into the
scsi host struct doesn't make sense.
