I think it's a valid thing to do, personally.  I had a "personal
laptop-mode" patch ages ago which just disabled fsync, fdatasync and O_SYNC
kernel-wide.  Gone.
It's the sort of thing which email purists tend to get emotional about, but
really this is a choice which should be made available to the user if you
want to do this thing properly.
sync() needs to still work.  If you have some app which calls sync() all
the time then you lose.
