Hm, strange, NID 0x03 shouldn't be accessed via AD1981 codec, at
least, thinkpad model.  Did you enable CONFIG_SND_HDA_CODEC_ANALOG?
Otherwise it won't work.

It may work, but first we need to make sure that we're seeing the same
problem.  MSI is one of the unstable factors for many platforms, thus
the driver tries to disable MSI first if any sign of wrong irqs is
found.
