In some private correspondence with Arnd it turned out that this code was
indeed the culprit for him. Fortunately it's easy to avoid -- when you do
as I wrote above it becomes dead code, and dosemu works just fine
(confirmed). In default dosemu 1.2.x setups it's also dead code; it's just
Debian that chose to continue using it.
Fear not. The offending code has since been removed, in development
versions of dosemu, if for no other reason than that except for the
original author (Hans Lermen) nobody understood it.
Hope that clears things up.
