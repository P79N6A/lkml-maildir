I just wanted to put in another report.
My Yamaha 744B Sound is not working with Linux 2.5.7-pre2 and ALSA Sound 
Support.
I know about the muting, so please don't bother emailing with that.  I 
am also aware that a there was some discussion about undocumented setup 
required for the 744B chip specifically.  I was wondering whether this 
issue had been resolved.  Does anyone else have a Yamaha 744B working 
with linux 2.5?
PS - Everything is fine with the OSS drivers in both 2.5 and 2.4.
