Subject: [PATCH 3/8] AF_RXRPC: Key facility changes for AF_RXRPC [try #2]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/3/101

Export the keyring key type definition and document its availability.
Add alternative types into the key's type_data union to make it more useful.
Not all users necessarily want to use it as a list_head (AF_RXRPC doesn't, for
example), so make it clear that it can be used in other ways.

+Under some circumstances, it may be desirable to desirable to deal with a
+bundle of keys.  The facility provides access to the keyring type for managing
+such a bundle:
+
+	struct key_type key_type_keyring;
+
+This can be used with a function such as request_key() to find a specific
+keyring in a process's keyrings.  A keyring thus found can then be searched
+with keyring_search().  Note that it is not possible to use request_key() to
+search a specific keyring, so using keyrings in this way is of limited utility.
