No worries.  I've just got through the results on the other machine in
the mix.  That machine seems to be fixed by backing out RSDL and not by
the fixup 0.32 patch ...
This second machine seems to had hard very soon after user space starts
executing but without a panic.  I can't say that the symptoms are very
definitive, but I do have a good result from that machine without RSDL
and not with rsdl-0.32.
The machine is a dual-core x86_64 machine: Dual Core AMD Opteron(tm)
Processor 275.
I'll let you know if I find out anything else.  Shout if you want any
information or have anything you want poked or tested.
