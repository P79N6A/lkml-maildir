An added note is that with Local APIC on and IO-APIC off, 
I am able to start the system up, but swtiching from X to a virtual
console during a session, as well as during shutdown, causes the system
to hang.  There are no error messages that I can find.
Does anyone know the cause of the problem?
Recap of my system:
CPU:		P4 2.0A 2.0GHz
RAM:		4x256MB RDRAM PC800

		Intel i850
Disk:		IBM Deskstar 120GXP 80GB
Graphics:	ATI 7500 OEM
Distri:	RedHat 7.2
Kernel:	2.4.18
X:		Xfree 4.2.0
