Hi,
 I have seen a peak bulk transfer bits-per-second calculation in the
"usb/gadget/ether.c" file as given below,
 #define        HS_BPS          (13 * 512 * 8 * 1000 * 8)
 #define        FS_BPS          (19 *  64 * 1 * 1000 * 8)
Could any RNDIS/USB experts help me to understand how this calculation
had come up and what are the components which get multiplied here for
the full/high speed bits per second?
Thanks in advance for the help.
Regards,
Joji
