Hello,
With 2.4.0-test8 (test8-pre6 seems to be OK) vgscan (at
boottime) "sees" al my volumegroups which are on IDE disk, but not those
on SCSI disk.
I had no problems mounting a "plain" ext2 scsi partition on same disk.
After some "research" i found sd.c is patched, but not yet in test8-pre6.
vgscan version:
sjoerd:~ # vgscan -h
Logical Volume Manager 0.8 by Heinz Mauelshagen  04/11/1999  (IOP 6)
lvm,scsi-disk compiled into the kernel, but mostly as modules.
