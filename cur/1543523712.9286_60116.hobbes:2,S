It's not only possible, it is explicitly legal.  It always has been.
You _must_ call it with GFP_ATOMIC if you can't afford to block (or,
alternatively, call it without __GFP_IO, or with the PF_MEMALLOC flag).

It's not a problem.  If callers are expecting GFP_KERNEL to be atomic,
then _that_ is a problem, but it is perfectly all right for GFP_KERNEL
allocations to block.
