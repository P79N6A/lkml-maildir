In fact, I can only make XMMS skip sound for a very brief period, just
after starting it up. After a few seconds, it seems the dynamic
priorities are adjusted and I can't make XMMS skip sound anymore. To
reproduce it, open up a big window, then launch XMMS and make it play
some MP3 file. Then, start moving the big window around. For me, this
causes XMMS to skip sound for a brief period of time (~5 seconds,
approx).
