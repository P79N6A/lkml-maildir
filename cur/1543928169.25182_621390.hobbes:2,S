Saying "reporter doesn't seem to be responsive" is a joke if there was
zero activity in solving any of these bugs for nearly three years.
They might (or might not) be fixed by chance now, but they should have
been fixed in the beginning of 2005 as a result of the bug reports.
You can now claim these are too old, but you'll find for any bug age 
bugs that both should be solvable for a developer knowing the kernel 
code in question and that have not been seriously debugged.
