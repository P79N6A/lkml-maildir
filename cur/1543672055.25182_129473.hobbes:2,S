Hi!
  I needed this patch to be tested. The patch has two parts. The first is 
updates to the g346fb driver to use the cursor api. The second part is 
a code optimization of the pixmap code. The purpose of the pixmap code is
to take image data and byte or word padd it according to the needs of the 
hardware. The problem was it was only copy on byte at a time. This was a 
performace killer. Soon now it copies a whole scanline at a time. Please 
test.
