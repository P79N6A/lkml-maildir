At least on 760MPX chipset, when Athlon is pushed into powersaving mode
(disconnected from PCI bus) great deal of graphical distortions are
introduced into bttv -based card's picture.
I've dealt with this by rmmod:ing amd76x_pm -module (this action disables
powersaving mode), but some sane API for disabling these disturbancies
would be much better.
