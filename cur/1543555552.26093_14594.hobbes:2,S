usb-uhci doesn't also have any problem with sharing irqs:

Hm, no one left to blame...
I would debug it as follows:
Place various printks in the initialization code (reset_hc(), start_hc() and
alloc_uhci) and find out after which printk it hangs. Then it would be
possible to investigate this further...
