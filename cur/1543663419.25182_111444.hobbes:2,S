My only boxes on which this is a problem are the SMP athlons, and only 
with UP kernels...

Only recently, though, and probably because they started receiving
complaints that the BOOT kernel (most importantly) and the UP kernel were
not booting up correctly on SMP athlons. At least that's the impression I
got browsing bugzilla.redhat.com.
Moreover, it makes a measurable difference in interrupt latency (and
consequently in the number of UDP packets dropped under stress), so on my
production machines I run RH kernels with this option re-enabled (among 
other changes).
Anyway, I'd like to get to the bottom of this, since I've narrowed it down 
so much. Anyone know who submitted the APIC changes in 2.4.10-pre12? I'd 
debug it myself, but I know next to nothing about the APIC. If you know 
where to get some documentation, I'm more than willing to give it a shot.
Thanks,
Ion
