Before I put it in I was getting a weird error trying to run UML on a
native kernel with page table sharing.  After it was solid.  That's emprical, 
but...

Yes, good observation, I was looking at it inversely: when we have a
count of one then we must have exclusion from the mm->page_table_lock.

It would be very nice if the lock isn't needed.  OK, it's going to take some
time to ponder over your post properly.  In the mean time, there is exclusion 
that's clearly missing elsewhere and needs to go it, i.e., in the read fault 
path.
