    I agree tempting: I thought you might like that in a subsequent patch,
    yes?  Mingming was splitting locks, not doing a cleanup of inlines.
There was a time when "inline" was a very cool tool because it had been
judged that the overhead of actually calling a function was just too
heinous to contemplate.  From comments in this and other discussions,
is it safe to say that the pendulum has now swung the other way?  I see
a lot of people concerned about code size and apparently returning to
the axiom of "if you use it more than once, make it a function."  Are
we as a community coming around to using inlining only on very tight,
very critical functions?
