Ok, I just measured it, and it is more than I expected.  The code is
attached at the end.  (You can use it for measuring other interrupt
overheads too).
If I disable interrupts using cli(),
I consistently get:
    low: 0000002e, high 0000002e, total 1b6b0b00, lost 00000000
    Percentage cycles lost: 0.000000%
With interrupts enabled, network interface disabled, task run as top
priority SCHED_FIFO, and I checked only timer interrupts occur during
the test:
At 100Hz, on a single 300MHz Pentium II, 440LX:
    low: 0000002e, high 0000a0e7, total 1b758d4f, lost 000a824f
    Percentage cycles lost: 0.149498%
    low: 0000002e, high 0000a08c, total 1b7528ee, lost 000a1dee
    Percentage cycles lost: 0.143928%
    low: 0000002e, high 00009fdb, total 1b749e93, lost 00099393
    Percentage cycles lost: 0.136250%
    low: 0000002e, high 00009ff9, total 1b7517b1, lost 000a0cb1
    Percentage cycles lost: 0.142971%
    low: 0000002e, high 0000a0e0, total 1b74c678, lost 0009bb78
    Percentage cycles lost: 0.138464%
    low: 0000002e, high 0000a18f, total 1b7533b8, lost 000a28b8
    Percentage cycles lost: 0.144526%
    low: 0000002e, high 0000a0f8, total 1b749561, lost 00098a61
    Percentage cycles lost: 0.135739%
    low: 0000002e, high 0000a441, total 1b752bbc, lost 000a20bc
    Percentage cycles lost: 0.144083%
    low: 0000002e, high 0000a156, total 1b7526b8, lost 000a1bb8
    Percentage cycles lost: 0.143805%
    low: 0000002e, high 0000a0b1, total 1b75194e, lost 000a0e4e
    Percentage cycles lost: 0.143061%
This counts the overhead of timer interrupts and anything that happens
in return path of timer interrupts.
Summary: Single 300MHz Pentium II on 440LX chipset.
Average timer interrupt overhead at 100Hz: 0.14225%
Average cycles per timer interrupt: 41240.6
Average time per timer interrupt: 137.47
Extrapolating to 1024Hz, expect 1.4566% time to go servicing the timer
interrupts.
Quite how this translates to "reasonable 486+ its definitely a non
issue" I can't see.  Maybe 486s are faster than Pentium IIs?
enjoy,
