Firstly, I'm very sorry for I thought this is not a kernel related topic
but allow me to ask some question.  This is for my root account Only.
I login as root then after all I logout.  After I logout it took for 
about 30 minutes for me to login again.  What are the possible reasons for
this problem? Am I being hack?
Help me please
