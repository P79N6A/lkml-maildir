Subject: [PATCH] Generic AVL-Trees.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following patch replaces the three independent implementations of AVL
trees in the kernel with one "generic" implementation.  This implementation
is based on the same idea as linux/list.h.
The existing uses of AVL Trees are in:
linux/mm/mmap_tree.c
linux/net/bridge/br_tree.c 
linux/net/ipv4/inetpeer.c
This patch has been repackaged with kernel 2.3.46.  (The existing AVL code
rarely changes, so it will probably also apply to most other kernel
versions as well.)
I feel the inclusion of this patch will make the kernel just a little more
friendly for developers that wish to explore different types of storage
mechanisms.  With the generic AVL-Tree code, it is trivial to implement the
standard binary-tree functions, and there is little to no debugging or
detailed analysis of the AVL internals required.
Your comments would be appreciated,
-Kevin
