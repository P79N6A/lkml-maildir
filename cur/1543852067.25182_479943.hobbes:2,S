check out 2.6.19-rc4-mm2: it detects this breakage and works it around 
by using the PIT as a clock-events source. That did the trick on my 
laptop which has this problem too. I agree with you that degrading the 
powersaving mode is not an option.
we've got a question about HPET: it seems all recent hardware has it, 
but the BIOS rarely mentions it, so the Linux driver does not enable 
HPET. Is there any chance to enable HPET (in the chipset?) - this would 
probably be a higher-quality clock-events source than the PIT.
