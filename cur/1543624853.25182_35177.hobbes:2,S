Yes, I know you have told me that before, but I'm being overcareful. See:
<quote> from device drivers book by Alessandro Rubini, chapter 12, page 331
The request function has one very important constraint: it must be atomic.
request is not usually called in direct response to user requests, and it is
not running in the context of any particular process. It can be called at
interrupt time, from tasklets, or from any number of other places. Thus, it
must not sleep while carrying out its tasks.

No race there. All that loop_put_buffer() cares is that helper thread wakes
up. If helper thread woke up earlier and completed its job, fine. If helper
thread wakes up later, that is fine too. If helper thread wakes up
unnecessarily, it will just go back to sleep after noticing that that there
is no work to do.

If there is any chance of being merged to mainline kernel, I will fix these
"hurt the eyes" formatting issues.

Removing it simplified the code a lot. Doing remap direcly from
loop_make_request() would probably be more effective. Just remap and return
1 from loop_make_request() like LVM code does.
