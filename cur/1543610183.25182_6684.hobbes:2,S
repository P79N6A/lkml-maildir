That's why Red Hat ships the kernel-source RPM; you can build external
modules against that and it has the "make dep" information for all kernels
Red Hat ships for that platform (with a smart "if" that selects the
currently running one)........... But note the word "external". You build in
another directory and don't touch the original .config file or tree......
Unless you need core changes, that's perfectly possible for almost all
modules....
