We've (finally) uprev'd all the 4 and 8 CPU machines with newer, great SCSI RAID
controllers. ( For some range of 'great' ) 
http://www.osdl.org/lab_activities/kernel_testing/stp/
The new cards are Adaptec 2200S SCSI RAID, and we now have true 64 bit PAE 
support. No more bounce buffers!
However, IO tests run post 3/23/04 will not be comparable to tests run before,
due to the hardware change.
Please, run a bunch of STP tests, and complain.
More Details:
64MB Cache ( not battery-backed ) 
firmware version V4.0 ( Build 6011)
2 each in the 4-cpu machines,
4 in the 8-cpu machines
Drive cache is set to write-through on all drives.
4-way dmesg:
AAC0: kernel 4.0.4 build 6011
AAC0: monitor 4.0.4 build 6011
AAC0: bios 4.0.0 build 6011
AAC0: serial 0ba60f4
aacraid:        NMI ISR: NMI_PRIMARY_ATU_ERROR
AAC1: kernel 4.0.4 build 6011
AAC1: monitor 4.0.4 build 6011
AAC1: bios 4.0.0 build 6011
AAC1: serial 0ba6120
aacraid:        NMI ISR: NMI_PRIMARY_ATU_ERROR
This makes us happy:
Mar 25 07:35:52 stp8-000 kernel: AAC0: 64 Bit PAE enabled
Mar 25 07:35:53 stp8-000 kernel: AAC1: 64 Bit PAE enabled
Mar 25 07:35:54 stp8-000 kernel: AAC2: 64 Bit PAE enabled
Mar 25 07:35:56 stp8-000 kernel: AAC3: 64 Bit PAE enabled

Thanks and praise to Our Own Russell Evans, for doing the
speedy install.
