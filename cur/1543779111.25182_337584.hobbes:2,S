Hi Andrew,
Thanks for the response.
I found a better solution to my problem with my HP N5430 laptop over on 
the alsa-devel list, my sound had quit working also. The new
solution, which was pointed out to me by Henry Yuan was to boot with 
lapic. I had noticed in the dmesg output that a lapic existed but was 
turned off by the bios, and a pseudo local apic was being used, this 
caused problems with APCI and my sound.
If you would still like the dmesg I would be glad to send it.
Steve
