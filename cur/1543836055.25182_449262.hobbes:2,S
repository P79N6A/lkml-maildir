Huh? Did you read the code? Or is it just easier to call things "screwy" and
start hacking away?
i_nlink only gets rolled back in the case that the file system wasn't able to
actually complete the unlink / orphan operation. The idea is to keep it in
sync with what's actually on disk. So when we call iput() in the unlink
path, disk and struct inode should be accurate.

Anyway, it's only done that way because at the time it seemed the cleanest
approach - there's no technical reason why we must roll it back. So a helper
function doesn't seem necessary - you'd just have to look through the small
amount of code and re-order things a bit.
Unfortunately you didn't actually put the contents of
__inode_set_awaiting_final_iput() in this patch, so I'll have to dig through
the others to see what exactly you're up to. In the meantime I'd say this
patch is either unecessary or just plain wrong.
