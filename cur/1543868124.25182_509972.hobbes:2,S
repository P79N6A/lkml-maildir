AFAIK these messages occur as a result of bad frame tx/rx, and it
doesn't get handled by the hardware/firmware very well, and I'm
quite sure it never did.
Now regarding the whole thing surrounding mptlan, I don't think
that LSI officially supports that feature any more or willing to fix
any bugs for it in their firmware or driver. Is that right?
If so, we might as well remove that driver from the kernel.
