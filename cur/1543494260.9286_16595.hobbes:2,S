Hi Andre.

I can't say whether it will be supported in 2.2.x versions, but if it
isn't, it will almost certainly be supported somewhere in the 2.3.x
series so you shouldn't have to wait for the 2.4.x series to start.
Besides, going on past behaviour, there won't be a 2.4.x series as the
2.3.x series will be followed by the 3.0.x series...but that's far too
far in the future to be certain...
Best wishes from Riley.
