Hello,
I would like to know whether there exists a device-driver debugger on
Linux like SoftIce on Windows. From the working of kgdb, I understand
that the debugging on the Target machine can happen once the code
reaches the gdbstub, which is well past the driver-initialisations.
Can some light be shed on the possiblity of such source-level debugging
?
- Would be glad to receive help
- TIA
