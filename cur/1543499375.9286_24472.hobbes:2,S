I had problems similar to this a while back, when I copied large files
from partition to partition, it would corrupt.  I finally was able to
track it down to my IDE controllers (HD and CDROM) - because NFS copies
to/from SCSI was fine.  That machine was a single CPU Pentium Pro on a
PIIX3 motherboard (Venus).  I figured it was a bad motherboard because
Windows had Silent Data Corruption as well.  But funny it never
corrupted the superblock or directories or such, just the middle of
large files...
I've since "upgraded" to a PIIX4/Celeron(SMP) system, and so far, in
2.2.9, I haven't had any problems (yet) with files that turn out different
on copy, even large files...  I'll have to try it some more once I get my
bios fixed from a bad flash ... *sigh* (though my laptop hasn't had any
problems with 2.2.9 yet.)
