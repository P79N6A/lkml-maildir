   Hurd is definitely using the translator field, and I only recently
   discovered they are using it to point at a disk block where the
   name of the translator program (I'm not 100% sure, but I think it's
   a generic, out-of-band, #! sort of functionality).  I don't know
   about the other fields, but I can find out.
Something like that.  The author field is akin to gid/uid.  I don't
recall the exact usage of i_mode_high, but it has something to do with
translators.

   Relegating them to an xatter would break compatibility with
   existing hurd filesystems.  We could take the arrogant "Linux is
   the only thing that matters", and just screw them, and the net
   result will probably be that Hurd will never implement some of the
   advanced features we've been talking about.  They might not
   anyways, though.  A real problem is that as far as I know, the hurd
   ext2 developers aren't on the ext2-devel mailing list.
   I've cc'ed two people that sent me a request to add some additional
   debugfs functionality to support hurd; maybe they can help by
   telling us whether or not hurd is using i_mode_high and i_author,
   and whether or not hurd has any likelihood of tracking new ext3
   features that we might add in the future or not.
Both i_mode_high and i_author are used in the Hurd.  But they are only
used if and only if creator of the file-system is the Hurd, same for
the translator fields.

   E2fsprogs previous to e2fsprogs 1.37 ignored i_extra_isize and
   didn't check whether or not the EA's in the inode were valid.
   Starting in e2fsprogs 1.37, e2fsck understands i_extra_size and in
   fact does validate the EA's in the inode.  If we add new i_extra
   fields, then currently e2fsprogs will ignore them, and that's OK
   for things like the high precision time fields.  But if they are
   fields where e2fsck does need to know about them, then obviously we
   would need a COMPAT feature flag to signal that fact (since e2fsck
   will refuse to operate on a filesystem if ther is a COMPAT feature
   that it doesn't understand.)

   The easiest way to do future-proofing is to state that they must be
   initialized to zero.  That's how we handle unusued fields in the
   superblock, after all, and it means that it's relatively easy to
   add new superblock fields without needing to cause compatibility
   problems..  If you absolutely, positively need e2fsck to abort if
   it doesn't understand a particular field, that's what a COMPAT
   feature flag is for.  Otherwise, new kernels can simply check to
   see if the field is non-zero, and if so, honor it, and old-kernels
   will simply ignore the new information.  In many cases, that's more
   than sufficient.
