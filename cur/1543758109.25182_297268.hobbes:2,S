That is basically, what you do with SCHED_RR.

This is SCHED_FIFO.
(Strict priority scheduling, allowed to starve anything below)
So just try to use the right scheduler for your application right now, ok?
If your system is busy with top priority task, why should the kernel disturb 
it?
Things will stop anyway, if your high priority task is needing a resource,
which is blocked. Than it becomes unrunnable and other tasks have
chances to continue. Kernel threads are likely to execute then, because they
are likely runnable then. Your task could even migrate, if a lot of kernel 
tasks 
are waiting in one CPU and your task is NOT bound to a specific CPU.
So the system is not brought down, but just busy in a infortunate way.
Stupid applications can starve other applications for a while, but not
forever, because the kernel is still running and deciding.
