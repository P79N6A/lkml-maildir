I keep soffice open all the time.  The box in question has 512mb of ram. 
This is one app, even though I use it infrequently, would prefer that it
never be swapped out.  Mainly when I want to use it, I *WANT* it now (ie not
waiting for it to come back from swap)
This is just my oppinion.  I personally feel that cache should use available
memory, not already used memory (swapping apps out for more cache).
