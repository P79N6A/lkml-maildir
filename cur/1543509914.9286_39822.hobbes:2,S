Hi Alan,

There is no diff. I have a couple of older ISA sknet cards, and i'll try
to fix the driver, soon. 
However, you will probably need the lastest version of the multicast patch
as multicast is still horribly broken in current kernels (the only card
that at least somehow works is the PCMCIA tropic card, but only because it
contains an ugly hack to upload the correct functional address mask to the
card).
Cheers,
Jochen
