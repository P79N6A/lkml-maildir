Tigran, 
I can immagine 2G - 4G offsets being functional as offsets into
"/dev/kmem".
However, "lseek" behaviour is then undefined. I mean, Linux has taken
the approach to disable (normal) files larger than 2G for this reason,
just to prevent lseek from having to return negative numbers.
Whenever you're dealing with an application that is legitimately
messing around with the 2G-4G area of a /dev/kmem file, it better be
very careful. Which officially means: "lseek doesn't return valid
values". On Linux at least the errno value will be set to preposterous
values, whenever you enter the "negative" area of "kmem".
