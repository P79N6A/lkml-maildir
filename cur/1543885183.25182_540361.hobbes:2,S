Martin, Cornelia already sent me (and lkml) a patch to fix this all up
if you want to just use that instead.

Yes, this was in -mm for quite a while, and yes, I knew about the
conflict with the input tree, that's why I waited to send this to you
separate from the first merge set and in the second batch, thinking that
either had already sent his stuff, or was going to do so afterwards, and
would be trivial to fix up.
Sorry about that, sometimes core changes like this take a bit of
coordination across subsystems.
