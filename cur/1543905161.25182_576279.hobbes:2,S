Unfortunately I spoke too soon and some mouse warps occurred
yesterday. I suspect faulty hardware, so I'll try with my old
non-optical mouse. If it still happens then it's either the mobo
or the kernel. In the meantime I'll plug this one in another pc
and see if the warps happen there. After that it's running old
kernels to see if the warps happen there too. Any other ideas
to check whether it's a software or hardware problem?
The more annoying sticking key problem is gone for good though.
Greetings,
Indan
