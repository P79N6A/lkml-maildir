I agree, but while device is powered off, its registers can't be accessed
Thus, if I ack the IRQ every time the handler is called, I will access the 
powered off device (this is probably won't hurt a lot, but a bit incorrectly)

Here it isn't a problem, this is a video capture card, and I suspend it by just stopping dma
on all active buffers even if in the middle of capture, and I send those buffers to card again
to fill them from the beginning during the resume.

Exactly, I am aware of suspend_late , but I don't want to abuse it.
