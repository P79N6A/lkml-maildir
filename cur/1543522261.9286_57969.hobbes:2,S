According to Keith Owens:

No, there definitely is a problem _somewhere_.
Twice in the last few months, my server has gone into Serious Failure
Mode: I've been unable to log in remotely.  The second time, I finally
managed to log in, but my shell was unable to mmap /lib/libc.so.6.
Both times, the logs report (loudly!) that the kernel had run out of
inodes ('exceeded inode-max').
Unfortunately, since it seems like the dcache prefers to keep growing
until inode-max is approximated, it's hard for me to know when things
are OK and when they're about to go BOOM.  *sigh*
