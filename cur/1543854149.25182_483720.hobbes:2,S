The patches mostly look good to me. Lots of valuable cleanups too.
But they are clearly .21 material, needing much more testing.
I don't want to merge them before I have the .20 queue flushed
because merging them right now would cause too much patch churn 
I think and it's better to do that once the main flood of .20
patches is gone. So I would like to delay merging a bit until
that happened.
Is that ok for you?
