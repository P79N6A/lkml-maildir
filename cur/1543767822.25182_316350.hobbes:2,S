Here are the core patches for CKRM updated to 2.6.12-rc3, along with
the most basic classification engine and a slightly more advanced derivative
and, several bug fixes to the core code.
All of these changes have been tested on IA32 and PPC64, with CONIG_CKRM
on and off, including both basic functionality tests and a variety of
stress/performance tests.  There are still a few minor code cleanups that
are in progress, but nothing functional outstanding in this set.
Upcoming patches (soon to be included) are the memory controller (parts of
which are being currently discussed on linux-mm), the listen accept
queue and an IO contoller (or maybe two).
