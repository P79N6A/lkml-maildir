Indeed, with no inline, on a P4 (with -O2), numbers betweeen xadd-lock 
and zadd-lock gets closer:
inc-lock in cache takes 35.15ns
xadd-lock in cache takes 43.84ns
vadd-lock in cache takes 53.51ns
zadd-lock in cache takes 43.28ns
inc-lock out of cache takes 122.92ns
xadd-lock out of cache takes 126.98ns
vadd-lock out of cache takes 172.36ns
zadd-lock out of cache takes 126.01ns
The always-lfence instruction in vadd-lock really is painfull though.
If numbers are close, and given that spinlock size considering structure 
alignments should not matter much, wouldn't it be better to use a double 
short and remove the 256 CPUs cap?
