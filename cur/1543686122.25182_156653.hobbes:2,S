Is there any interest ins omeone 'fixing up' as many structs in the
kernel from the form:
struct foobar = {
	cow:	moo,
	cat:	meow,
}
to:
struct foobar = {
	.cow	= moo,
	.cat	= neow,
}
And if so, what form should I feed it back in? Big patches? 1 patch
per file? 1 per dir?
Main reaosn I'm asking is that it's slowly being done but isn't in
the janitor list of things to do yet. If it were I'd just do it. ;)
(not on kj-discuss btw so please CC me or lk (or both))
