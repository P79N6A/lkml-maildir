Hey all -
The following 5 patches allow reiserfs and selinux to work together.
01-selinux-load_policy.diff
  - Allows load_policy to fail and to not BUG on the second attempt.
02-selinux-private-inode.diff
  - Allows "private" inodes that aren't tracked by selinux xattrs
03-reiserfs-private-inode.diff
  - Abstracts the private inode implementation in reiserfs to a static inline
04-reiserfs-selinux.diff
  - Uses the selinux private inode implementation to allow reiserfs to mark
    inodes as private. Also works around the checks in vfs_rmdir.
05-reiserfs-const-fixes.diff
  - Cleans up warnings introduced by 04-reiserfs-selinux.diff
Take a look, I'm interested in feedback. 
-Jeff
