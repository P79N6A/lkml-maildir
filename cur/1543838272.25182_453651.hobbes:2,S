So...  has anybody given any thought to enabling fsync(2), fdatasync(2), 
and sync_file_range(2) issuing a [FLUSH|SYNCHRONIZE] CACHE command?
This has bugged me for _years_, that Linux does not do this.  Looking at 
forums on the web, it bugs a lot of other people too.
My suggestion would be to add a FLUSH op alongside the existing READ and 
WRITE[_SYNC] ops, rather than passing down WRITE_SYNC.  Why?  Doing so 
maintains a 1-1 translation between requests and disk commands, and it 
would allow MD and DM more flexibility in handling this operation.
But that's just a guess.  I'm open to suggestions.
