James already mentioned the probing issue and looking further through the
driver there's lots of need for improvement.  I think we should try to get
2.6 merged up with all the changes from the last unified driver and additional
fixes posted to the list (e.g. the dma_sync thing, did you have a chance to
look at it?) so that we have a proben base until we look into it.
P.S. from  a sort look the fusion-based adapters seem to be completely
different from existing megaraid adapters.  What non-trivial code is
actually shared?
