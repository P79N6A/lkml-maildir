No reply, so I suppose I can rip it out ? :-)
Thus any reason why that patch wouln't fly ? (not for 2.6.23 of course)
This removes the last occurence of flush_tlb_page() from generic code,
thus making this hook now optional for architectures that don't use
the helpers in asm-generic/pgtable.h
I couldn't find a case where this is actually needed, but I may well
have missed something. If I did though, please tell me what. If an
architecture need that call for obscure reason, it could be simply
folded in that architecture's implementation ptep_set_access_flags().
