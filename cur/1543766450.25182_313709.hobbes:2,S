Yes, I see now.

bin attribute was created for lm_sensors scripts format - it only caches
read value.
I think there might be only 2 "must have" methods - read and write.
I plan to implement them using connector, so probably they will go away
completely.

connector allows to have different objects inside one netlink group, 
so it will use it in that way.
I think only two w1 methods must exist - read and write, 
and they must follow protocol, defined in family driver.

If I understand you correctly, "lifetime rules" are implemented in a
following way:
when object is created it has 0 refcnt, each access increments it and
must 
decrements when access is finished.
According to mix of sysfs vs. current refcnt I see a possibility to
free object in ->relese()/remove() method and that is all, but I need to
investigate it more deeply.

w1_bus_master structure is low-level physical operations.
It _completely_ does not know abou logical links to other
w1 core objects, Why _bus_ driver should know about logical
objects on top of it? That is why they are separate.
Even if they are not too different (and actually they _are_ different)
from your point of view, they differ in abstration model.
Bus master driver - is like NIC driver, it does not know about the rest
of
the network stack, but you want it to have all info about neighbours,
routes
and so on...

No.
w1_bus_master is low-level driver for physical hardware operations.
w1_master is logical structure which is operated by w1 w1 core stack.
It has it's logical slaves, it has it's own attributes and features,
it _completely_ does not belong to low-level physical layer where you
want to place them both.

This is wrong - netlink notification is used and will be moved to
connector
interface later.

It is better to move all attributes inside code creating master device
so place that attribute creating into w1_int.c

kobject is too big for that. It is used exactly for kobject changes.
Custom netlink notifications are created for w1 specific objects
and it's control. You can not control w1 slaves/masters using hotplug.

As I said I have feature requests for ability to export w1 devices
outside w1 core.
Probably it is due to it's private non-GPL usage, so it is not created, 
but it is usefull feature actually and we can not know what will 
happen in what context when we export master/slave devices.
w1 slaves can be found on the bus without search method reaction 
implemented in it's asic, btw.
And it is _very_ usefull to add/remove slaves using external command but
not using
automatic detection in search methods.

Exporting them into other kernel modules.
We do not know in what context that structures will be used there.

It does not only low-level operations, 
but, well, probably it is better to place it there.

I created that files exactly for reaason to not scan the tree, but only

I think I described it in a master exporting paragraph, let's drop it

You moved all lto device model, while I want to have existing model
due to described actions.
So the right solution is to not break all existing locking, which
is mixed with device driver model, but create preper interoperability
model.
I will think of it some more, I will integrate your ad Adrian Bunk's 
cleanups first when current pending patches are pushed.

It is not read and read_bin, but read and write.
I have not implemented write methods monthes ago since I did not
have such a hardware, but now I see it was bad decision which
confused people.

What you do is exactly the same that already exist, but using other
model.
No need to dig into device model in a such way.

It is not.
You pointed an error, and it will be fixed after I think about it some
more,
the problem is that device model[which is not the main part of the w1
system]
is interfere to the existing locking schema [which is quite big and
allows very flexible object manipulation], and you suggest to almost
completely
replace one with another.
With such changes how to increment slave's usage counter? module_get
(w1_family)?

If we remove slave deivice, we must be sure it's object is freed 
when appripriate kobject is released.
The same is with family itself.
No, we need either replace all locking with device driver model, 
or properly operate with existing one.
I will investigate it deeply, I'm sure will will find the best 
solution.

Exactly as existing netlink notifications, which allows 
to bring not only simple predefined actions, but any information you
like.
As you said, we can not fit all existing w1 devices into very confined 
limits, so hotplug events which are add/remove can not solve the
whole notification problem.
Simple notification mechanism that was created for w1 is only first
step,
of course it can be replaced with hotplug notification,
but only it, if we want, and I strongly believe we will want, to extend
it a bit we will fail with current hotplug approach.
