It means there's 94% left to play with (duh).
There are no interrupts.  [*]

That's more or less what we do, yes.
Except we skip the kernel.

It's the fastest and has the lowest CPU overhead, and the lowest latency
if done properly, but I agree it's not nice.  Like interrupts it doesn't
generate any bus traffic when nothing's happening.

... except a minimal amount of protocol and thread dispatch.
FWIW, our driver could probably handle filtering & recording at Gigabit
rate, or indeed multiple 100Mbit/s cards.  But I'm not going to write it.

  This implementation works by polling DMA descriptors, which normally
  get to live in CPU cache so polling is fast.  Poll statements are
  inserted in the user-space code.
  The polls are fast but intrusive.  We could automate their insertion.
  However it's a pain and doesn't generalise e.g. for Linux running
  normal apps.
  In RL per-packet interrupts are a killer at this rate.
  No-one has got this performance with interrupts AFAIK.
  I'm contemplating RT-Linux style fast timer interrupts to poll the DMA
  descriptors as a generalisation which might just work.  We'd lose in
  latency and add a (fixed) extra CPU overhead, but it would be
  predictable, and any user-space code would be ok.
