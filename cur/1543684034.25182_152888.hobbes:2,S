You forget one important thing:
If a _user_ of a stable kernel notices "it doesn't even compile" this 
gives a very bad impression of the quality of the Linux kernel.

My patch adds BROKEN_ON_SMP only to drivers that don't compile, but if a 
driver causes e.g. data corruption on SMP I don't see a reason against 
letting it depend on BROKEN_ON_SMP.
