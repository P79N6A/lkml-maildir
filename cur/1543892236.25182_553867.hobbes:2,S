You're saying that making an option user-visible changes whether
*config overrides .config?  That's non-intuitive.

That's a good point, but I think I do want it user-visible.  If
someone sees someething I suspect to be a stack overflow, I'd like to
be able to tell them to bump KERNEL_STACK_ORDER and see if the problem
goes away.
As for something sterner, it turns out that Kbuild provides some
support for this.  So, drop the previous patch in favor of this one:
Force KERNEL_STACK_ORDER to be at least 1 on UML/x86_64.
