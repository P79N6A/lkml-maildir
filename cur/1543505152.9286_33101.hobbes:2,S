Hi Robert.

My understanding is that all platforms CAN do 64 bit calculation, but
it's generally frowned upon on 32-bit platforms as it's rather slow.
Presumably, something along the lines of the following would be
preferred...
 Q> #ifdef NATIVE_64_BIT
 Q>	// 64-bit calculation
 Q> #else
 Q>	// 32-bit calculation
 Q> #endif
Best wishes from Riley.
