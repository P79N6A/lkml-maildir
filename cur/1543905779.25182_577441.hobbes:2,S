There is no exclusive-only attitude towards the scheduler.
If you send me small and obvious improvements, they'll get applied to the 
scheduler, exactly the same way they get applied to anything else.
And if you try to rewrite everything, and do it on your own, and then 
don't even send me a patch, it also won't get applied. 
Surprise?
