In kernel very easy. The IP addresses and the driver init/cleanup are 
completely separated and can be easily done independent. You may need
some way to prevent packets getting submitted to the driver (e.g. a
netif_carrier_off but make sure to not confuse it with a real 
netif_carrier_off done by the driver, so you'll likely need a new flag) 
I'm not sure it it worth it though given how easily it is to simulate
in user space. If you really wanted it I guess best would be to add new 
ioctls for it. Coding should be easy.
