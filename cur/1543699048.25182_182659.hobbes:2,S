This appears to either leak migration threads or not set
rq->cpu[x].migration_thread basically ever for x > 0. Or if they
are shut down, how? Also, what makes sure cpu_idx is initialized
before they wake? They'll all spin on cpu_rq(0)->lock, no?
Furthermore, sched_map_runqueue() is performed after all the idle
threads are running and all the notifiers have kicked the migration
threads, but does no locking whatsoever.
Also, does init_idle() need to move into rest_init()? It should be
equivalent to its current placement.
Why not per_cpu for __rq_idx[] and __cpu_idx[]? This would have the
advantage of residing on node-local memory for sane architectures
(and perhaps in the future, some insane ones).
