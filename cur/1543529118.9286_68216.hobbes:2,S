I'm new to this list and haven't been following this whole restructuring of
/proc closely at all but I have one comment that might be relevant. Where I
work we do a lot of Java programming. Some of it requires access to Linux
system information. Up to now we very easily just read and parse the various
/proc files since they are just text. If these files go away (even if their
functionality is replaced by other programs) this makes things much harder
for Java since it would require doing nasty RMI things.
Or, restated, getting system information from "plain" text files is a good
thing. Please don't break it.
Thanks,
