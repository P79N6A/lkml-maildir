Having found about it recently, 'git status' is quite useful.

For me at least, providing a file list is a pain, because I am so 
precise [read: obsessive] about keeping an otherwise clean working dir 
:)  Except in rare occasions, I know precisely that the changes in the 
working dir comprise 100% of what I plan to commit.
Locally I have scripted
      git-diff-cache -p HEAD | diffstat -p1 | awk '{print $1}' > /tmp/lst
      git-update-cache `cat /tmp/lst`
because of this.
[again, clearly doesn't work with remove/add/mode change]

That's pretty much what I suggested when I said
	git commit --figure-out-for-me-what-files-changed
:)
So I certainly agree there.
