Don't get me wrong. I'm NOT opposed to having a config tool everyone and
their aunt can use. I'm opposed to that tool taking away the options expert
users have to do what they know is right for them.
Thankfully, decent tools for novice users already exists, in the KDE project
for example. And if the tool is missing a few things, please improve it
instead of forking a new tool with the same goal.
