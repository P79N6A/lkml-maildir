Sweet!  Paydirt!  Is this documented/guaranteed to
continue to work for a while?
Is this true for all non-mmap()ed dirty buffers for a
given file?
Just to restate what you said:
- if part of a file is mmap()ed, msync() MUST be used
to sync it.
- any non-mmap()ed portions are synched with fsync().
I'm assuming this is a per-process thing.  i.e. The
above is true regardless of what other processes are
doing (e.g. even if another process has the same file
mmap()'d, I don't care).

I know.  Unfortunately not my call.  Desperately
trying to beat people with clue sticks....
Thanks!,
