Make an interface whereby ide-cdrom (and ide-disk, etc) can walk
the list of all unclaimed devices (i.e. devices owned by
ide-default), check they are of the correct type, and claim them
(thereby removing them from the ide-default driver).  When
unregistering, reverse the process and give the device back to
ide-default...  i.e. make ide-default a holding pen for unclaimed
devices,
