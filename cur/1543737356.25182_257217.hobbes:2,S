Do you mean by completely isolated (1) running two separate system
images on separate partitions connected at most by networks and storage,
or do you mean (2) minimal numa interaction between two subsets of
nodes, all running under the same system image?
If (1), then the partitioning project is down the hall ;)  But I guess
you knew that.  The issues on this thread involve managing resource
interactions on a single system image.
Just checking ... the words you used to describe the degree of
separation were sufficiently strong that I became worried we were at
risk for a miscommunication.
