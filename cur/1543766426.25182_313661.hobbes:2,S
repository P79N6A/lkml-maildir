I know of at least 1 x86-32 box from a three-letter-named company with
this feature that has been shipping for a few _years_ now.  That box is
pretty much everywhere now, and I know that other versions of it are
also quite popular (despite the high cost...)

Your hardware is just a pci card, right?  Why wouldn't it work on ppc64
and ia64 then?

Wait, what _is_ "your stuff"?  The open-ib code?  Or some other, private
fork?  Any pointers to this stuff?
