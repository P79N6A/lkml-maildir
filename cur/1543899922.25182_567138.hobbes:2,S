They are, even if you manually pack them into the first kernels initramfs.  Not
sure where you see a dependency here.

No not at all.  Well, not really.  If you configure kdump to use makedumpfile,
the mkdumprd script runs makedumpfile -g to generate a config file that gets
packed into the kdump initramfs for use during the dump process, which is all
makedumpfile needs to successfully filter the crashing kernel.  So we are
dependent on the first kernel during kdump service startup, since we need to
generate that config file, but after that, we're completely independent.
