I have a similar problem with an onboard VIA-UniChrome chip, driven through 
an out-of-tree vendor-supplied driver just to get 85Hz refresh.  Other than 
the pain of maintaining this driver out-of-tree, I have to contend with a 
50% speed reduction compared to vesafb.
vesafb is probably the most important display driver for compatibility 
reasons, and as such should support a large range of functionality.
Is there any technical reason why vesafb shouldn't support non-BIOS modes?
Thanks!
