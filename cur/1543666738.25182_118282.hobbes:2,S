This is nice, thanks.  We don't have to touch the char drivers now.
Ah, I wish we could change that function to be:
int register_chrdev_region(major, num_minors, name, fops)
if it wasn't for the tty drivers wanting to start their minor at 64.
Hm, wait, why can't we just do it that way and not change the tty core
to use the register_chrdev_region() call?  It should still all work
properly, right?  The tty core would ask for 256 minors, and split them
off the same way it currently does.
thanks,
