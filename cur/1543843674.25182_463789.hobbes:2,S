What's the point though?  If you can find configs.ko, you can have
install_modules copy config.gz there, no?  And you also have it in
/boot/config-`uname -r`.  /proc/config.gz has a trust value only
because it is linked into the image.  Having it as a module gives the
exact save level of trustyness that the perfectly well working
solution of copying in /boot had before.
In other terms, if you allow configs.ko, you can't trust the contents
of /proc/config.gz anymore and /proc/config.gz lost all its interest
where it comes to debugging.
  OG.
