2.6.18-mm3 and 2.6.19-rc1-mm1 break playing encrypted video DVDs with 
libdvdcss based players.
The player just says it can't open /dev/dvd with libdvdcss; after that, dmesg 
points out
hdX: read_intr: Drive wants to transfer data the wrong way!
(hdX is hdb or hdc, depending on where the drive is connected).
This is reproducable on at least 3 different machines with different IDE 
controllers and CD drives.
Has there been any intentional change that would require modifications in 
libdvdcss?
Last known good kernel is 2.6.18-rc2-mm1 (didn't keep binaries for those in 
between and I'm confined to abysmally slow compile machines at the moment).
