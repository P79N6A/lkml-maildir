  Hi, all. Version 127 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.3.22-pre1. Highlights of this release:
Work sponsored by SGI
- No longer disable devpts if devfs enabled (caveat emptor)
- Added flags array to struct gendisk and removed code from
  drivers/scsi/sd.c
- Created /dev/discs hierarchy
				Regards,
					Richard....
