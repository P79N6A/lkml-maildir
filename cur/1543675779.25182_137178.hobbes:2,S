I rebooted with the same drive but added hdc=14589,255,63, and now I can
make the filesystem perfectly well.  So it does seem to be an issue with
the way the disk is addressed.  Or I could just be fooling myself.
Later I can try swapping in identical hardware and see if the problem
persists.  All these disks are brand new and were burned in and
qualified by the vendor.
