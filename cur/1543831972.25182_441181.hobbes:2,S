So it looks like your Opteron continues to count CYCLES_NO_FPU_OPS_RETIRED
at full clock speed even when halted.
My Turion appears to slow down to ~40 MHz when halted and counts those
events at that speed.  Using idle=poll shows no slowdown, as expected,
and unhalted clocks equals cycles_no_fpu_ops_retired.
