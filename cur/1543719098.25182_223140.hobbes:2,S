I have a question about that.  I keep a debian mirror on one of my machines. 
there is over 70000 files.  If I run find on that tree while it's
downloading the file list, it doesn't take as long.  I thought it would be
nice if there was some way I could keep that in memory.  The box has 256mb
ram no swap.  It is configured as diskless.
