Hello list,
The documentation related to atomic operations says that the following
functions should be called in SMP safe maner
 void atomic_add(int i, atomic_t *v);
 void atomic_sub(int i, atomic_t *v);
 void atomic_inc(atomic_t *v);
 void atomic_dec(atomic_t *v);
since the implementation of these functions are prefixed with LOCK
prefix (On i386 arch.) which either asserts LOCK# signal or performs
cache locking which gauarentees coherency.
Then why these functions should be called in SMP safe manner?
