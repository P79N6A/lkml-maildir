It appears that urgent data are handled strangely if they are sent to
localhost by either 127.0.0.1 or public ip address. This can be seen
as ABOR ftp command not working. It works well when accessing the machine
by ftp from outside. It shows like urgent byte is missing and ftpd does
not see it.
kernel version 2.1.14. wu-ftpd from redhat-6.1.
