XFS comes to mind, indeed. But as I said, a need for fsck and unclean
partitions are enough to label it as an "unsuitable" solution.

When you have files open for writing (thus neither mount R/O or umount will
suceed)?   No, you really need kernel support for this, and yes, I imagine
it is a royal pain to deal with these cases, they clearly belong on the "20%
of stuff that causes 80% of the work" side :-)
