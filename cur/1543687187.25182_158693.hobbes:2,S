Nevermind, known problem..  That will teach me not to check first. ;)

They know, there's a patch for -test3-bk5 should Just Work for -mm3.
Linux 2.5 (2.5.75, 2.6.0-test2) updated 08/18/2003
This patch is the 1.0-4496 equivalent of the 1.0-4363 patch, the same
installation instructions and comments apply. If you experience problems with
this patch, please let me know.
In Linux 2.6.0-test3-bk5, PCI names related data structures were changed again,
you will need to apply the incremental patch below to make the driver build on
this kernel. The patch is trivial, if you are using another driver release, you
shouldn't have trouble porting the change. Download:
