OK. It is natural user-friendly generalization of bind(). I do not see
problems.
Though, please, explain, to avoid misunderstanding. Let's take the second
case for simplicity. Is that true that it is supposed to add
to each application a switch "home or care-of"? This sound strange enough,
taking into account that only a few of applications have switch sort of -b
in openssh despite of age of plain bind() is equal to age of internet. :-)
