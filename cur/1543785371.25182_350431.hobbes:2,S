Argh, it seems I'm going to be giving this example forever!  Here's  
why this won't work.  We want to have sys/stat.h do something like  
the following:
# define __kabi_stat64 stat
# include <kabi/stat.h>
/* Now we expect struct stat to be defined with correct types */
Since struct stat in that case uses fixed-bit-size types, the header  
fine <kabi/stat.h> needs to include a file providing those types.  If  
it used stdint.h types, such as uint32_t, then it would need to  
#include <stdint.h> or provide the stdint.h types itself.  In order  
to remain POSIX compliant, sys/stat.h must not include stdint.h or  
assume that stdint.h is included or that those types were defined by  
the user program.  Therefore, kabi/*.h cannot use the stdint.h types  
at all!  The solution is a separate file, kabi/types.h, which  
properly defines __kabi_[su]{8,16,32,64} which are safe to include  
and reuse anywhere.  Then sys/types.h would look like this:
# include <kabi/types.h>
typedef __kabi_u8 u_int8;
typedef __kabi_s8 int8;
typedef __kabi_u16 u_int16;
typedef __kabi_s16 int16;
[...]
