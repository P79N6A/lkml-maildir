_Might_ be OK, except that you can't get to the covering object if you do
that. I'ld rather have /proc/self/cwd giving you the cwd (instead of the
covering object) and made ls without arguments try to open that before the
"." (on the theory that the former is precisely our cwd while the latter
is best approximation to it).
Patch looks sane, but ". == no-op" semantics looks wrong for me. I'ld
rather see ". == step upwards" variant.
