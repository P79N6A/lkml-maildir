Hmm.... all I can say is that I could reliably knock the box off the
network by running a four processes that tied up all CPU's at high
real-time priorities, and after I applied the horrible hack that
guaranteed that tg3_timer() was run every 0.128 seconds, the system
stayed on the network.  I'm not sure why, but it did fix the problem.  
Any suggestions on how I could figure out what was really going on and
what would be a better fix would be greatly appreciated.
