What I described is a supported feature, nothing more and nothing less. It's 
also relatively easy to handle this case correctly in glibc, e.g.,

There is no way to avoid these problems with chroots; it's not that anybody 
creates stupid problems on purpose.
The approach I'm proposing fixes these problems. It has a small disadvantage 
for statvfs / fstatvfs in some situations, which is due to the fact that the 
kernel doesn't offer a direct interface for querying the mount options of a 
file descriptor or path, and so glibc has to resort to messing 
with /proc/mounts. I don't see a nice way of fixing this without introducing 
[f]statvfs syscalls right now.
This is what POSIX says about statvfs / fstatvfs:
> It is unspecified whether all members of the statvfs structure have
> meaningful values on all file systems.
In my opinion, the advantage of not reporting bogus pathnames in /proc/mounts 
by far outweighs the problems is sometimes causes for fstatvfs(). Anyone 
relying on the information obtained from statvfs / fstatvfs is making false 
assumptions anyway, and in "normal setups" as you called them, nothing 
changes for fstatvfs and statvfs.
