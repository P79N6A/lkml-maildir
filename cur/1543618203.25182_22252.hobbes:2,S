Do you think there are no other benefits besides the scheduling latency in
a realtime system?
In a realtime system you want your event handling code (outside of the
interrupt handler [on Linux: bottom halves/tasklets/sorftirq?) get running 
on the CPU as fast as possible. Therefore a realtime kernel is often fully 
preemptible (well, there are always critical sections that has to disable 
interrupts).
So the time between the interrupt handler wanting to schedule a specific 
task/thread and the next scheduling decision is crucial, right? 
I have no hard numbers, but I can imagine that this can also lead to
better IO (in terms of latency AND IO throughput but with the cost of 
cpu cycles [user space CPU throughput]).
I don't know the Linux kernel good enough right now, but if you shorten
the scheduling latency: that could be a win for faster IO. But there's always
a tradeoff: if you spent too much time in scheduling decisions/preparations
the overhead eats the lower latency (especially if your mutexes have to deal
with priority inversion, giving a lock holder at least the same priority as
the lock contender for the period it holds the lock).
