On a slightly related note, I played with lmbench a bit over the weekend,
but the results were too unstable to be useful ... they're also too short
to profile ;-( 
I presume it does 100 iterations of a test (like fork latency?). Or does 
it just do one? Can I make it do 1,000,000 iterations or something
fairly easily ? ;-) I didn't really look closely, just apt-get install
lmbench ... 
Thanks,
M.
