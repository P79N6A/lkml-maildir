I'm not claiming anything about old hardware.
It should be self-evident that mmconfig doesn't work on old hardware, is 
not needed on old hardware, should not be turned on for old hardware, 
and in general should never disturb old hardware.

The facts as they exist today:
1) Existing 256-byte config space devices have been known put 
capabilities in the high end (>= 0xc8) of config space.
2) It is legal for PCI-Express to put capabilities anywhere in PCI 
config space, including extended config space.  (I hope our PCI cap 
walking code checks for overruns...)
3) Most new machines ship with PCI-Express devices with extended config 
space.
Therefore it is provable /possible/, and is indeed logical to conclude 
that capabilities in extended config space will follow the same pattern 
that existing hw designers have been following...  but only once the 
current OS's have stable extended-config-space support.
Maybe that day will never come, but it is nonetheless quite possible 
without today's PCI Express spec for this to happen.
We must handle this case, even if mmconfig is COMPLETELY DISABLED (i.e. 
normal mode today).
