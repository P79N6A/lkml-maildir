hi,
has anybody information about linux attempts on
the new UNISYS ES7000 system?
(it's a 32 processor Intel-machine grouped by smp-"cells" 
of four and a "crossbar" connecting the cells.)
they promote it together with M$ for W2k (adjusted version) 
but as I read they support SCO as well...
especially interresting to me is that they promote only 
NT-benchmarks and no comparision ;-)
