Hi Mike.

 > If you come up with something, I'd be very grateful indeed!

Instructions:
 1. Connect L and N to your power supply, which should deliver 8-14v at
    100mA, either AC or DC is OK and polarity not important.
 2. Connect "Tel A" and "Tel B" to your telephone line.
 3. Connect OFFLINE, ONLINE and RING to your favourite parallel port as
    required.
 4. Select R1, R2 and R3 such that the junction R2/R3 is between +1.0v and
    +1.5v, and the junction R1/R2 is between +2.5v and +2.7v, both being
    relative to system ground. Actual values are unimportant so long as
    these ranges are met, but current requirements depend on the two
    comparators A and B.
 5. Select R4 and R5 such that R4 is 24 times R5. Current rquirements
    again depend on the two comparators A and B.
Best wishes from Riley.

| There is something frustrating about the quality and speed of Linux  |

| in other words, I can implement this XXXX feature, but I bet someone |
| else has already done so and is just about to release their patch.   |
