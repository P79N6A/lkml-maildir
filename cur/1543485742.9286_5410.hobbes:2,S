Yes.  The problem isn't that though.  In 2.0.36, I mount /dev/sr0
and /dev/sr1 no problem.  In 2.2.0 however the kernel says that
they are sr0 and sr1 no problem, but it wouldn't mount them at
all.
Someone told me that I must make sure "probe for LUN's" or
something is NOT enabled in my kernel to use ide-scsi, and I
checked and found out that it was enabled.
I've disabled it, and am recompiling 2.2.1 right now for further
testing.
