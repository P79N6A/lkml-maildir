Compiling gigs of source code doesn't probe a thing.

I am beginning to wonder if you really know what you are doing. Do you
actually know what -O6 does? Automatically unrolling loops and
inlining functions behind your back is not necessarily something you
want on a modern CPU.

I use 2.96 every day and I frequently report bugs in it, on the ia64!
I do not use it on 2.2.x kernels for the x86 because of the well known
issues.
