See above. The columns further to the right are debugging info.

I'd definately like to see this. It would be great if somebody
would sit down and implement this.   <hint> <hint>

This isn't currently possible. Also, I suspect what we really want
for most situations is a way to better balance between the different
uses of memory.  Again, patches are welcome (I haven't figured out a
way to take care of this balancing yet ... maybe we DO want some way
of limiting memory usage of each subsystem??).

Rik
