On the other hand EVMS allowed me to make a minimal solution by taking 
care of the partitioning and the DM-API in the EVMS framework. The user 
interface is just an add-on that comes with the package. Right now its 
just a way for the user to get a "look its really there". If we do the 
RAID configuration and writeing the configuration blocks to the disks or 
not is in your hands. When we consider this to be to risky then lets 
just skip it.
