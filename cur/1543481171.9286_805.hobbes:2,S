There are strange TCP stalls in recent development kernel, at least from
2.1.132 and up that does not occur on 2.0.x. After a period of some
seconds to several minutes of network activity over a PPP dialup connection
(ISDN "modem" over serial port, 16550A, 115k2) nntp, imap and http
connections begin to stall, while ping continues to work. For example, I see
# netstat -na
 Active Internet connections (including servers)
 Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
 tcp        0     42 212.242.4.81:1032       212.242.40.196:119     ESTABLISHED
It just sits there forever. It seems almost certain that the problem is
triggered by disk activity.
# hdparm /dev/hda  
/dev/hda:
  multcount    =  8 (on)
  I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)

  keepsettings =  1 (on)
