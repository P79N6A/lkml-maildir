Not quite.  The 2-3-4 tree has embedded linkage, but it can be done
lockfree if you really have to.  The problem is that a single 2-3-4
list entry maps to two red-black list entries.  I could atomically
update a single 2-3-4 list entry, including its pointers, even when the
list was being read or updated by other users.  I could not work out
how to do the equivalent update when the list linkage data was split
over two red-black nodes.
The list structure is an implementation detail, the use of 2-3-4 or
red-black is completely transparent to the main code.  The main code
wants to lookup a structure from the list, to update a structure, to
insert or to delete a structure without waiting.  How the list of
structures is maintained is a problem for the internals of the API.
