Yes, same thing.  Either way, register_xxx has a new requirement it
didn't have before, to keep track of the number of users.

You didn't show me how to get rid of my ip_conntrack problem without
it in the previous mail.
That's a *real* example we have today.  My code fixes it without
requiring a split of such interfaces.

It's well understood, and already more widespread than any other real
solution.  All other approaches being equal, it wins.

No, *every* unregister function needs to change.  What's gradual about
that?

Look, you're wrong.  Keeping it in userspace is complex; I have lines
of code and bytecounts for you to read.  You can argue as much as you
like but I've been there, and you're simply not listening.
Moving this into the kernel has proven to be smaller, more flexible,
makes small initramdisks possible *and* makes the whole thing vastly
simpler.  What part of this don't you understand?

I challenge you to write a 64-bit kernel linker in a 32-bit userspace
in the codesize of my in-kernel linker.  I've tried it, and it's *not*
easy, and when you pile on all the extra kernel interfaces to support
it don't quite work, you end up *nowhere near*.

Maybe, but it gives an indication of how much it costs us to have this
feature, which is why I've kept it through development.  I blame
CONFIG_PREEMPT for getting me into bad habits. 8)

I started implementing module race solutions back in early 2001.  This
is not a rushed decision, sorry.
This is more heat than light now 8(
