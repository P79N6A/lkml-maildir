I'm getting to my wits end, so any help would be greatly appreciated.
I've got two disk servers, on with SuperMicro X5DPL-iGM motherboard, the 
other with a X5DPL-TGM board.  These system use the E7501 chipset, and 
provide to PCI-X buses.  One for slots 4 and 5, the other for slot 6 and 
the embedded Intel 82545EM GigE NIC.
I have had nothing but trouble trying to use slot 6 on these machines. 
Recently I've been trying with a MV88SX6081 133MHz PCI-X card.  In both 
machines I get lockups when trying to use the controller.  I also see 
corruption on the on-board NIC on the TGM (though not on the iGM) with 
the card in slot 6.
I'm running Fedora Core 4 with kernel 2.6.12-1.1456_FC4smp and mv_sata 
driver 3.6.1.  I'm stuck on the older kernel because of the mv_sata driver.
Now, maybe this is all the fault of the mv_sata driver, but I believe I 
had problems on the iGM machine with a Intel 82545GM PCI-X nic in slot 6 
as well which does not use the mv_sata driver at all normally.
Thoughts?
