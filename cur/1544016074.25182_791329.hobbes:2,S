Correct, you can look to it as two separate bugs:
a) the next character is not ignored while it should;
b) the status bits 31-8 are copied to the 'ch' variable while they shouldn't.
Both bugs prevent correct break signal handling (and therefore correct
behaviour of the magic SysRq key). Bug b didn't cause too much trouble
earlier because in most situations the status bits are all zero; for
this case they unfortunately aren't.
I can split them up if you like, or we can keep them together, as they
are in fact related.
Thanks,
