As i thought the init scripts were my problem. But i have an other question.
I recently started to use NFS. But with the mainline kernel cpu usage is 
100%, and when i look in top si shows bewteen 40 and 60% cpu usage. With 
your kernel si is 0%, but ksoftriqd/0 shows around 38% cpu usage and  
total cpu usage is around 52%. Is this normal? on my server cpu usage is 
2% but it uses a intel network card. My laptop is using a wireless 
pcmcia card (cisco).
