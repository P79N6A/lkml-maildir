Why would someone even attempt to restore an NTFS volume 
onto an HFS one? NFS does not currently export NTFS, Vfat, 
etc. Version 4 _does_ include support for EAs.
Have stat() report that the file isn't simple; provide a libc call for
copyfile() or similar, and then you've defined a system-wide standard
way of dealing with them. Tar can check for ISMULTI or whatever, and
then read the streams out (the tar format actually supports EAs,
although specific actual tools may not). Cp can check ISMULTI and with
do the copy itself, or call copyfile() if it is available (latter
preferred).

Simply provide a method for accessing them using the 
VFS. Like Linus' "/" idea. Or a ":". Or let the FS 
tell the VFs what character it prefers. Then NTFS
could really act like NTFS.
