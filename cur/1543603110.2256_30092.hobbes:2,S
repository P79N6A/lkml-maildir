Hi everyone,
	I'm new to this list, and have been using Linux for just over a year now. 
I'll get straight to the point, as I think this may be a bit off-topic. I'm 
trying to apply a patch file to support a PCI printer card I've got. The 
patch file contains several patches, but only the last one is working. I'm 
prepared to try and sort it out myself, but I just need to know something 
about the patch file so I might be able to understand how it works. Can 
anyone please explain (or point me to the relevant documentation) to me 
what the following lines mean?:

+++ linux/include/linux/pci_ids.h	Sat Sep  8 09:44:45 2001

I'm using RedHat 7.1 with the included 2.4.2-2 kernel. Any help on this 
matter would be much appreciated.
