It would be nice to have a cooperation between glibc and the kernel to
have syscalls mapped by name, not by number.
With name->number resolved by crtbegin.o reading a public kernel table
or accessing a fixed-ID kernel map function and filling a map.
So if internally ( at the application ) sys_getpid has index 0, the
sysmap[0] will be filled with the id retrieved inside the kernel by
looking up "sys_getpid".
