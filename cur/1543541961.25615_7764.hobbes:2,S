drivers/zorro is on the line of drivers/pci, it's code to drive the
Zorro bus, there are no drivers for devices connected to a zorro bus
in there, just like there are no PCI Ethernet drives in
drivers/pci. drivers/macintosh are a mixture of the code for the
busses and actual devices, I'd like to see the actual drivers moved to
other directories, char, scsi etc. and possible merged with drivers
for other machines that use the same chips.
