That just looks like a subset of the core patch except for the
member's name and the bin_attribute change I didn't notice (which
looks very useful), so yes that is good (although I don't see any
reason to change the name).
Truth is after looking at how all the sysfs derived attributes are
used its hard not to believe that all the attributes should be changed
for exactly the same reasons as device_attribute. For example my patch
against net-sysfs.c uses class_attributes, and that cleans up the code
nicely and saves space. What attribute type wouldn't benefit from this
change? I know its a lot of work to change the driver's to benefit
from it but it breaks nothing in the mean-time and I'm committed to
doing a fair bit of that work if need be.
If you think the patch should be split up more and incrementally
implemented I can understand that, but we obviously need to change the
derived attributes eventually to make use of it, why not now? It
doesn't really break anything, my large update is just to remove the
harmless warnings.
Thanks,
Yani
