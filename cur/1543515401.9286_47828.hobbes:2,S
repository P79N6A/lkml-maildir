    I would like a way to find the name, address, and length of every
function currently loaded in the kernel (2.2.5 on x86).  /proc/ksyms
gives only exported symbols, so I've been looking at kernel executable
with nm.  For now, I'm not concerned about module functions.
    nm reports some symbols that do not appear to be loaded.  They are
generally at higher addresses and from the section labelled
".text.init", although I have not checked them all individually.  My
guess is that these symbols were declared __initfunc, and as such
their text was unloaded after they were executed.  Is this right?
    If so, can I tell whether one of these symbols is loaded or not?
    When/how are these symbols unloaded?
    Are only symbols in the .text.init section subject to being
    unloaded?
    Are there any documents on the net related to this?
    Thanks in advance.
