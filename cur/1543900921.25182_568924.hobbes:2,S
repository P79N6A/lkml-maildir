With device_shutdown there really isn't a path (although putting
the device into a quiescent state is exactly what that method does).
However with the module remove path you disassociate the pci device
and the pci device driver and then after restore you go through
the pci devices and you redo the association (as if the pci
device or the module had just been loaded).
For devices that have a really slow probe/initialization this might be
an issue but it will work, and generally it will work fairly quickly.
So in that sense restore may be the wrong concept for devices.
At least for prototypes.

Yes.
For cpu state I'm fairly certain we don't need to do anything fancy.
At least for the first pass prototyping with a uniprocessor kernel
will remove that hurdle.

Right.  That caused all kinds of weirdness in your patch.

I was thinking the assembly stub would be the small piece that jumps
to loaded hibernated kernel.  Quite possibly we could just get away
with providing no memory and just an entry point to kexec but it
makes sense to me to plan on running a couple of instructions.
Actually the way the kexec infrastructure it might be reasonable to
just use sys_kexec_load to load the entire hibernated image.  Except
for the fact that sys_kexec_load requires the source pages to be
in the processes memory image the code shouldn't have the 50% of
memory limitation already.
If we can get that going we don't even need to restrict the first
kernels memory.  So it might just require teaching sys_kexec_load
how to steal process pages.  Anyway something to think about.

Yes.  That may help.  Cooperative multitasking between kernels.
Anyway all of that comes after we get something simple working.
Then we can see what really needs to be optimized, and what works
well enough.
