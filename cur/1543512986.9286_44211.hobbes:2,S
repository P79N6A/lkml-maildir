I wouldn't know about loadlin as I've never used it, but I have booted
a few kernels >1M (1,048,576 bytes) in size using LILO, so have good
reason to suppose that it supports them.
One kernel I successfully booted was a 2.2.12 kernel of about 1.3M in
size, so well over both the 1M limit and the size of your kernel above.
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
