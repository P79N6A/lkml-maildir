Using the epic100 network card driver module, after upgrading from kernel 
2.4.17 to 2.4.18 I experienced problems with my network cards, of which I
have two. The first (eth0) serves my home network and seems to be
working just fine, but the second one (eth1), connected to my ADSL modem
is almost non-functional. I can hardly get connected after many failing attempts.
I used tcpdump to check the outgoing packets, everything looks normal on that
level. The 'send' LED flashes as data packets are sent, but I do not receive any
response at all.
I installed the epic100 module from kernel 2.4.17 again, and everything was
functioning again. My system is a x86 PC.
I am not subscribed to the kernel mailing list, so please CC me when
responding.
