Out here I have choice between 
  dialup (lots to chose from): $200/month(*), not always online. 
  cable (one company): $25/month, always online, lowsy performance. 
  ADSL (one company): $50/month, always online, starting january 2001, 
      delayed without notice: Not yet available. 
My only real option is "cable". So that's what I have. These guys
manage to configure every thing badly. So when their mailserver is
unable to get any outside connections, the mail gets queued without
notice on their server, and I won't hear about it.
To me this is unacceptable, so I have to run my own mailserver. This
is not that bad, as I can be always online. (not being always online
means that Email may sit in the queue quite long if for example I'm
online 10% of the time, and a certain mailserver is online only 10% of
the time. I'd have a 1% chance of getting an Email through to this
server, but being always online increases the chances to 10%).
