I found this one to work:
diff --git a/scripts/kconfig/qconf.cc b/scripts/kconfig/qconf.cc
index e4eeb59..4905cd1 100644

        QWidget *d = configApp->desktop();
 
+       setCaption("hello my little world");
        width = configSettings->readNumEntry("/window width", d->width() - 64);
        height = configSettings->readNumEntry("/window height", d->height() - 64);
        resize(width, height);
We should show the prompt associated with mainmenu here.
