I certainly agree with Andrew that preempt cannot cause a 60/70%
slowdown with a network card at least (if you do nothing but spinlocking
in a loop then it's possible a 60/70% slowdown instead but the system
time that a wifi card should take is nothing compared to the idle/user
time).

This is fine IMHO (even if they are preempt bugs). Except if your
machine is UP, if it's UP it would be better track down the bug, since
it may still happen on a SMP box (I wouldn't be too surprised if wifi
drivers aren't smp safe). I certainly agree with Andrew when he says
preempt is a good debugging knob to debug smp bugs in UP (though I would
leave it off in production UP, like in production SMP).
