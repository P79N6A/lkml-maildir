This sounds like a job for dazuko (www.dazuko.org) -- I know that utilities
like ClamAV use that to accomplish some very similar things to what you're
describing.

I want my driver to be at a level above things like ext3/reiserfs if possible. Basically I just want to "hijack" the system calls that applications use to access files and then pass them on to the original system call. Is this possible and how do I do it? Any help will be greatly appreciated and the utility I have in mind will benefit the entire community (I will GPL it of course) and I believe it could so some extent make Linux more popular. I am a bit secretive right now because I really want to implement this idea myself. I will give credit to those who responds to this message.
