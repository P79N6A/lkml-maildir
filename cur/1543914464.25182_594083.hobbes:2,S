Hello Roland,
        Since ehca can support 4K MTU, we would like to see a patch in 
IPoIB to allow link MTU to be up to 4K instead of current 2K for 2.6.24 
kernel. The idea is IPoIB link MTU will pick up a return value from SM's 
default broadcast MTU. This patch should be a small patch, I hope you are 
OK with this.
Thanks
Shirley
