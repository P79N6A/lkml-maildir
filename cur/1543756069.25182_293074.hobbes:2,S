I have the same problem and have been posting to other lists and groups 
without results. Under FC2 my ASUS 1681 had both sound and wireless. 
With recent kernels, nothing, both FC3 and kernel.org.
If you have system-config-soundcard (ie. FCx) try to configure. I get a 
response saying the rate locks at 48000 instead 44100 as requested.
