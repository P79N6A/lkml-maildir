I don't think removing the superlock from all fs is good thing at this stage (I
agree with SCT doing it only for ext2 [that's what we mostly care about] would
be possible). Who cares if UFS grabs the super lock or not?
grep lock_super fs/ext2/*.c is enough and we don't need debugging in the
scheduler for that.
