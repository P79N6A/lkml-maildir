Then that should be fixed in NTFS.
The original meaning of "->host" was that it could be anything (and it
was a "void *", but the fact is that all the generic VM code etc needed
to know about host things like size, locking etc, so for over a year now
"host" has been a "struct inode", and if you need to have something
else, then that something else has to embed a proper inode.

It's not Andrew who is assuming anything: it _is_. Look at <linux/fs.h>,
and notice the
	struct inode            *host;
part.
