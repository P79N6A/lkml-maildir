But there already is one registered :)  Okay, you\re right.

Because stuff should go into 2.5 first.    And even if it looks trivial
there's an important policy decision here:  do we want to clutter up
our personality system for userspace emulators?   If you look at the
current list of personalities they all have kernel implementations, even
if not all of them are currently merged, qemu OTOH is a purely userspace
thing (and still very new!).  Personally I'd rather prefer qemu doing
pathname translation in userspace instead of bloating the kernel.  This
gets even more important when we get qemu-style emulators for other
architectures - the number of personalities needed just for this ugly
pathname-translation scheme will get very high.

if you look at MAINTAINERS I'm responsible for personality handling, so
maybe it actually _is_ my call?
