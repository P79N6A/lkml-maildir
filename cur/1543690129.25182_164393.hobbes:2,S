Hi, I've just installed an M-Audio Audiophile 2496 sound card (Envy24)
with the 2.6.0-test5 kernel (with the preemptible kernel option on),
using the ice1712 alsa driver (although this also happens in 2.4.21
without preemptible kernel).
Music plays fine until I do *anything* - changing windows, scrolling,
pressing buttons, whatever - when it stutters badly. Scrolling in an
anti-aliased terminal is especially fun. However, if I play using XMMS
with the realtime priority option, everything's fine, although that has
the distinct disadvantage that I have to run it as root.
I've tried enabling/disabling ACPI/APM/APIC. The card isn't sharing an
IRQ with anything.  It's not a hard drive/IDE related issue, although
that's all using DMA anyway. 
I do have both an AGP and a PCI graphics card installed and in use,
although the stuttering happens if I do anything on either. I've found a
few references to this problem on google, but no solutions. It works
fine on Windows ;).
Here's what happens if I try to scroll in gnome-terminal whilst aplaying
something:
rg@russell:~$ aplay < test

[...and so on, for another 20 or so lines]
