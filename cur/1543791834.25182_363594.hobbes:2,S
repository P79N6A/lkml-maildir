Ok, so at first glance, I only need to pay attention to patches 15, 16,
and 27-32?  If so, please send the ppc64 specific patches through the
ppc64 maintainers, and the rpaphp specific patches through that specific
maintainer.  Then care to resend the 8 remaining patches to me, so I can
stage them in -mm for a while?
thanks,
