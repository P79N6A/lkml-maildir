Subject: [PATCH 2/2] incorrect direct io error handling (v7)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/12/343

Changes against v6:
 - Handle direct_io failure inside generic_file_direct_write() as it was
   recommend by Andrew (during discussion v1), and by Nick (during 
   discussion v6).
 - change comments, make it more clear.
 - one more time check what __generic_file_aio_write_nolock() always called
   under i_mutex for non blkdev files.
Tested with: fsstress, manual direct_io tests
Log:
If generic_file_direct_write() has fail (ENOSPC condition) inside 
__generic_file_aio_write_nolock() it may have instantiated
a few blocks outside i_size. And fsck will complain about wrong i_size
(ext2, ext3 and reiserfs interpret i_size and biggest block difference as error),
after fsck will fix error i_size will be increased to the biggest block,
but this blocks contain gurbage from previous write attempt, this is not 
information leak, but its silence file data corruption. This issue affect 
fs regardless the values of blocksize or pagesize, and off corse only for non 
blkdev files.
We need truncate any block beyond i_size after write have failed , do in simular
generic_file_buffered_write() error path. We may safely call vmtruncate() here
because i_mutex always held for non blkdev files.
TEST_CASE:
open("/mnt/test/BIG_FILE", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_DIRECT, 0666) = 3
write(3, "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"..., 104857600) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device)
#stat /mnt/test/BIG_FILE
  File: `/mnt/test/BIG_FILE'
  Size: 0               Blocks: 110896     IO Block: 1024   regular empty file
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<^^^^^^^^file size is less than biggest block idx
