Hi,
I just found a small bug in the way ramdisks work - it was introduced
sometime between 2.4.10 and 2.4.15. I haven't yet been able to try 2.4.17,
but I didn't see anything too evident in the patch/changelog.
Basically, if you use a filesystem with a blocksize that is not BLOCK_SIZE
then when the filesystem super block is loaded set_blocksize will be
called which will call kill_bdev which calls truncate_inode_pages on the
rd mapping - that ends up destroying the ramdisk.
I found this while using cramfs as an initrd, a hackish work around in my
case is to change the default block size of the ramdisk - I'm not sure
what the real fix should be.
Hope this helps,
Jason
