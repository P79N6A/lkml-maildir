I agree here - if it was just possible to do this between create and
add, this discussion would be moot.

I did a little helper struct for the firewire subsystem that might be
useful on a more general level.  It's struct fw_attribute_group in
drivers/firewire/fw-device.h and the implementation is
init_fw_attribute_group in drivers/firewire/fw-device.c.  But I agree,
attribute groups require a fair bit of boiler plate code.
