What second set?

The allocation is for all allocated percpu areas which is now per possible
cpu. The difference between THIS_CPU and __THIS_CPU is the context check
by smp_processor_id()

The caps functions are macros not functions. Macros are
capitalized. alloc_percpu must stay until the last remains have been
evicted. And the API does work differently.
