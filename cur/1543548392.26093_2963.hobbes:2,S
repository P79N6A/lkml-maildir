I'm trying to debug a nasty memory leak, and to get memory stats in my
debug output I'm directly accessing /proc/self/statm to get the
information I need. However the location of the leak appears to move
about, so I'm beginning to wonder if /proc/self/statm is real time or not?
Kernel version: 2.2.14 (-15mdksecure - i.e. stock Linux-Mandrake kernel)
