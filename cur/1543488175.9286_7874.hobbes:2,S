I had a similar problem not too long ago (UW SCSI disk, etc etc). The
problem turned out several binaries in /sbin were corrupted. The error
was somewhat misleading (in my cace anyway).
try breaking out the boot/rescue disk, and replacing /sbin/init with a
new binary, and see how it goes. You may find there'll be new errors
appearing, so possibly a few more files in /sbin may need replacing.
