i have released the 2.6.14-rc2-rt2 tree, which can be downloaded from 
the usual place:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
the biggest change is the merge to the 2.6.14 tree, but there are also 
updates all across the board: lots of ktimer updates and fixes from 
Thomas Gleixner, an important PI fix from Steven Rostedt, and lots of 
other details.
Changes since 2.6.13-rt6:
 - tons of ktimer updates: build fixes, SMP fixes and more (Thomas 
   Gleixner)
 - PI fix (Steven Rostedt)
 - ntfs fix for bit-spin-locks (Eran Mann)
 - updates/fixes in preparation of the ARM merge (Daniel Walker)
 - latency histogram cleanups (Yi Yang)
 - merge to 2.6.14-rc2
 - sysfs/scsi interaction workaround to get aic7xxx to boot
to build a 2.6.14-rc2-rt2 tree, the following patches should be applied:
