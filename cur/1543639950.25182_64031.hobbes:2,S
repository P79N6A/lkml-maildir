 Will this prevent me from affinitizing irqs via the proc fs or prevent me from
doing it from
within a module? I tried an irqbalance patch for the p4's for 2.4.18 and it did
in fact prevent me from doing this. This would be bad for those who use this irq
affinitizing thing
along with process affinity for real-time determinism improvements.
