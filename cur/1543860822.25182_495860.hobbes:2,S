I can't really help you with that one. I'd assume that you need to make
sure that the current process context is kept while the softirq is
running. Could be, that otherwise the process gets preempted and the
stored process context would be assigned to the new process or
something like that, but I'm just guessing wildly here.
Note that IRQ_EXIT_OFFSET is defined as HARDIRQ_OFFSET if preemption is
disabled, so that's probably key here, I just don't know what kind of
havoc preempting would cause here ;)
