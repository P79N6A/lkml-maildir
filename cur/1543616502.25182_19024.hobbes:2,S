Dave,
	Part of the sock cleanup made me remove the #include <linux/tcp.h> from
include/linux/ip.h and from include/net/sock.h, i.e., it is not needed in
those headers, but then I had to go to udp.c, ipx.c, decnet, etc, and add a
#include <linux/tcp.h> because it needs TCP_ESTABLISHED, TCP_CLOSE, etc,
this is a pet peeve to me, as a janitor :-) Can I change this to
PROTO_ESTABLISHED, PROTO_CLOSE, etc, and have it on a different header, say
include/net/protocol.h?  Its strange to have IPX, DecNET, etc having to
include net/tcp.h (that in turn includes ip.h, etc).
	If this is ok I can bundle it in the sock cleanup or send it
separately, your call.
