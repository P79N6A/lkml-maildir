.22 and possibly -stable.  -stable doesn't really matter because it is dead
code.

As long as the code remains dead and unused I don't really care when we purge it.
             That code should NEVER EVER be used.
               That code is UNMAINTAINABLE.
The code encourages random ABIs so we don't even know what we are supporting.
Once used in a production environment (i.e. where we have to support it)
it makes further changes to head.S essentially impossible.
Despite the lack of Documentation we not counting the paravirt mess in
head.S we have a well defined ABI for starting a linux-kernel.  Given the
generally difficulty of changing bootloaders I have no interesting is
messing up a good thing.
