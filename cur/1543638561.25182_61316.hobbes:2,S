So that's what is/can-be done through the madvice call or a flag on MMAP().
Force a specific size and policy. Why do you need a new system call.
The Rice paper solved this reasonably elegant. Reservation and check 
after a while. If you didn't use reserved memory, you loose it, this is the 
auto promotion/demotion.
For special apps one provides the interface using madvice().
