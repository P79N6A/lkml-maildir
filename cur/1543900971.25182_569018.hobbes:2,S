Pull req was sent an hour or so ago, here it is again.

    [CPUFREQ] Fix typos in powernow-k8 printk's.
    
    Based on a patch from Joachim which didn't apply, so I fixed
    it up by hand, and also corrected the surrounding indentation
    a little.

    [CPUFREQ] Restore previously used governor on a hot-replugged CPU
    
    Negative side effect: needs NR_CPUs pointer array of memory in
    CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU case.
    
    Still needs userspace track keeping and rewriting of governors if governors
    change while a CPU is not active (always the governor at CPU remove time is
    restored).
    
    Move of policy->user_policy.governor assignment is just a minor cleanup.

commit 91973de736bc97dc04156242c5a4b00993b6c902

    [CPUFREQ] bugfix cpufreq in combination with performance governor
    
    There is a frequency scaling issue that I encountered with the performance
    governor in combination with CPU hotplug.
    
    In cpufreq.c CPU frequency is reduced to its minimum before the CPU gets
    unregistered and set offline.  Does that have a particular reason?
    
    Since the (k8-)governor does not monitor CPU frequency that setting also
    applies then to the remaining CPU as well and lets the system run on the
    lowest frequency although performance is chose as the policy.

    [CPUFREQ] Longhaul - Option to disable ACPI C3 support
    
    On some motherboards ACPI C3 is available, but it isn't
    causing frequency transition on VIA Nehemiah. Longhaul
    wasn't working at all earlier, but due to
    scaling_cur_speed returning true CPU frequency now, it
    looks like CPU is getting stuck at highest frequency
    since 2.6.21. I didn't find a reason. Halt is causing
    frequency transition.
