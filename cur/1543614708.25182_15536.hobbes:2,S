Hi,
Has anyone gotten the Dual built-in LAN cards to work on the Tyan S2080 Motherboard?  I am running a Redhat kernel 2.4.9-13.. I haven't tried the latest kernel yet.. I saw some talk about this board in the archives but I found no solutions. It says it has a Intel 82559 LAN controller and a ICH2 LAN Controller. I am only seeing one NIC when I boot up. And dmesg is showing
eth0: Invalid EEPROM checksum 0xFF00, check setting before activating this device!
eth0 does initialize, and I can ping from it.  Anyways, is this fixed in a later kernel or is there a patch out there that hasn't made it into the kernel yet??
Thanks
Ryan Bonham
