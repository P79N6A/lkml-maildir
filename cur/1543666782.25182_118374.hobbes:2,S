Great!

I'm really not sure it's that safe.  At the very least the drivers all
need to make sure that their ->close() excludes their interrupt/bh work
from happening.  That would probably be possible but it seems that it
would be better to just build a robust refcount system at the lower layer.
This should make it quite a bit easier to ensure that the drivers are safe.
Also remember that some drivers have a common area that incoming PDUs
get put in (especially for AAL0 traffic) so there might be stuff in there
even after a close.
So I think you're right that it's possible to get by without vcc refcounting
I think the best method would be to implement an atm_vcc_{find,hold,release}
that uses the sock's refcount so we can cleanly and 100% safely take a
reference to a vcc from a bh.

Great - now we just have to do the same thing for vcc's :-)
