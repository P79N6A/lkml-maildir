In my experience I haven't quite found this to be the case.
Rather allowing a lock/mutex/etc.. to be recursively acquired
within a given path can greatly simplify APIs. Such as
cases where a primitive acquires a lock internally which is
also know by and suited to protect data in the caller's context.
This avoids the "who has the lock?" information which must
otherwise get stuffed into the API. Nested function calls
simply observe correct lock usage at their respective levels
and all unwinds correctly.
The one notable place where this doesn't work is where
locks must be conditionally acquired in an out-of-order sequence.
However often these cases can be pushed out of the externally
visible API. Another operational consideration is maintaining
debug information in the lock. Keeping track of where each
lock acquisition was made is at odds with a fixed sized lock
data footprint. Still recursive acquisitions scale only
with available stack space so a fair upper limit approximation
is possible when running on fixed size stacks. Note I'm
refering to single-owner spinlocks/mutexes here rather than
reader/write locks.

I agree. But I don't think the above precludes doing so.
Detecting violations of unbalanced lock/unlock calls isn't
really different than for non-recursive primitives.
