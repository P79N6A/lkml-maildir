What was it doing before this?  i.e. what were all the messages from the
card.  The message happens when the aic driver is unable to clear its
pending workqueue after it suspends ... which is part of error recovery.
So, what error was it trying to recover from?
By the way, your AIC-7892 is a different driver.
