Which surely broke my framebuffer, which worked fine with
2.6.6-rc1-mm1.
I have the following in my init script:
if lspci | grep -q 'MGA G400'; then
modprobe matroxfb_base
con2fb /dev/fb0 /dev/tty1
con2fb /dev/fb0 /dev/tty2
fi
And options matroxfb_base vesa=0x117
in /etc/modprobe.conf.
After the above loaded my monitor turned black and the led
started blinking. I just hope such changes can't damage it.
BTW, I'm not sure why, but the con2fb lines only work for the
first tty. I have to manually run "con2fb /dev/fb0 /dev/tty2"
after I boot. Isn't con2fb supposed to do it for any ?
