E.g. having a separate task count, which is incremented/decremented
only by clone/exit.  If the task count goes to zero, umount_tree is
called on root, but namespace is not freed.
And each mnt_namespace holds a proper reference to the namespace, so
it's safe to dereference it anytime.  When truly no more references
remain, the namespace can go away.
Hmm?
