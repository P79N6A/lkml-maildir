Worst case scenario is easy to model; if a nice -19 task starts at exactly the 
same time as a nice +19 task, the timeslices are 200 and 10ms. On 
uniprocessor the nice+19 task will wait _at least_ 200 ms. On SMT nice SMP it 
will be 200 - (200 * 15 / 100) so 170ms. That is of course worst case 
scenario and still better than UP since the latency will be less, the task 
will definitely start (interactive reinsertion wont affect it) and it will be 
on a second runqueue.
