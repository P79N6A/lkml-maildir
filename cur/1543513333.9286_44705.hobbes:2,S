We still have the underlying problem.  The hash lists used for buffer
cache lookup are only part of the buffer cache data structures.  The
other part --- the buffer lists --- are independent of the namespace you
are using.  If you have a dirty buffer in an inode's metadata cache,
then yes, you still need to deal with the aliasing left when that data
is deallocated unless you explicitly revoke (bforget) that buffer as
soon as it is deallocated.

It's write, not read, which is the problem: the danger is that you have
a dirty metadata buffer which is deleted and reallocated as data, but
the buffer is still dirty in the buffer cache and can stomp on your
freshly allocated data buffer later on.
The cache coherency isn't the problem as much as _disk_ coherency.
