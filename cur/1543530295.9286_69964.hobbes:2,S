And that's exactly what I implemented in the Linux kernel. I will
make the glibc proposal as soon as the kernel issues have settled
down.
And for the SYSV IPC case: Can you remove the segment after the last
attach? Or is this a segment which should be connectable as long as
the server is up? In the latter case you will need fd passing for
shm_open/shm_unlink to hand the open fd to the other process.
