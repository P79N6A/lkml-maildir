This really isn't a regression.  It's been always like that with libata.
 libata doesn't make devices go into standby mode and shutdown(8) does
it for libata.  The problem here is that libata does issue
SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE on shutdown.  So, the sequence of event is...
1. shutdown(8) issues SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE followed by STANDBY_NOW
2. kernel shutdown starts
3. libata shutdown issues SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE
4. power goes off
Some drives seem to spin up at step #3 even when its cache is clean and
power goes off right after the disk finishes the command.  So, it's
really bad when it happens - spin down, spin up followed by immediate
power off.
SCSI part of the fix is queued in scsi-misc-2.6 tree and libata-dev part
is acked and waiting to be merged, so the fix will be available in
2.6.22.  However, it's disabled by default to remain compatible with the
current behavior and requires userland change to fully fix the problem.
