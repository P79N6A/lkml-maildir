Hi,
Here are a few more fixes for the PCI core code for 2.6.0-test2-bk.
I've removed all of the struct device.name usages as that field is about
to go away, and there is a fix from Ivan in here too.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/pci-2.6
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
