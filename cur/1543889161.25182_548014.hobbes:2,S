That means something, but not that much.  The kernel could have been doing
broken things for two years in ACPI that happened to not trigger a bug in
someone's firmware, for example.  And when the kernel was fixed (to, e.g.,
do it right by the spec or unbreak other firmwares that did it by the spec)
and that triggered the bug.
We really need to find the cause of the regression to know.

We shouldn't do it for frivoulous reasons, of course.

We don't agree there, as you are not talking about a stable kernel series.
And btw, unless you hunt down someone that also has the bug and uses an
up-to-date BIOS (or something else to give an extra data point that discards
a possible firmware bug in your version of the BIOS), or bissect to pinpoint
what caused the regression, this thread will go nowhere.
