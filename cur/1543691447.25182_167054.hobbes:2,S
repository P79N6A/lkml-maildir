Subject: follow_page gone?

It would appear that, starting with 2.4.19, follow_page -- a fairly friendly way 
to get the struct page backing a virtual address (as in vmalloc virtual) -- has 
been removed from mm.h and made static to mm/memory.c.  LXR shows that this 
function was present in 2.4.18; the Changelog doesn't seem to mention anything 
about this (although I may have missed something, Changelog-2.4.19 is over 
100KB).  Is there a new way to do this?
Furthermore, is all of this stuff documented somewhere other than the various 
comments in the kernel source?
