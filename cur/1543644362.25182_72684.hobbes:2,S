Ummm ... I think it's just flat on or off node, presumably Erich
has "on the diagonal" meaning they're on the same node, and 
"off-diagonal" meaning they're not. In which case, what he suggested
seems fine ... it's really about 20:1 ratio so I might use 10
and 200, but other than that, it seems correct to me.
