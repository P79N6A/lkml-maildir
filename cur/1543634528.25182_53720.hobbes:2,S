Looking at how other kind of device trees are doing (typically
Open Firmware), I beleive this can be acheived by having a "type"
node (ie. file).
Also, there are lots of good reasons to put device/driver settings as
"properties" of the device node in the device tree, which ends up having
proc-like files under each device node.
We could define some standard ones (like the device type) and provide a
simple way (proc-like) for drivers to add more properties, thus replacing
in most cases the need for ioctls.
Ben.
