SuSE are patching their kernels to death anyways. ISDN here, new AIC7xxx

I've just moved my /var/spool/news over to journaling reiserfs beta
(assuming news aren't the most important data I have), to play with it.
Since Alan posted the ext3 site, I'm going to have yet another FS to
play with, I only need to find some data for it. Like /usr/src/linux :o)
