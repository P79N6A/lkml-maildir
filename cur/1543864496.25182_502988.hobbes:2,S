Outside of realtime workloads, I agree that performance should not be
a problem.  And I don't know of any reason why realtime systems need to
be able to do hotplug CPU.  Yet, anyway.  ;-)

I never have seen anyone try a freezer-based approach, so why not?
However, it seems to me that the notifiers are still needed in some form
or another -- for example, RCU needs to manipulate its masks.  My guess
is that you are proposing doing the CPU-down and CPU-up notifications
between the freeze_processes() and the thaw_processes().
Going through the list:
o	migration_call() needs to create a kthread, which can fail,
	so there still needs to be the dual phase bring-up, with
	CPU_ONLINE and CPU_UP_CANCELED.
o	comp_pool_callback() can also fail during CPU_UP_PREPARE,
	as can kernel/softirq.c:cpu_callback(),
	kernel/softlockup.c:cpu_callback(), timer_cpu_notify(),
	ratelimit_handler() [which returns 0 rather than NOTIFY_DONE,
	patch in separate email], pageset_cpuup_callback(), and
	cpuup_callback().
o	The following are unconditional: vmstat_cpuup_callback(),
	sysfs_cpu_notify(), cpu_numa_callback(), hrtimer_cpu_notify(),
	and rcu_cpu_notify().
o	None of the notifier handlers currently say "no" to a CPU
	going down, which is reassuring -- at least given that
	move_task_off_dead_cpu() is willing to forcibly migrate
	if needed.
OK, I indeed do not see any obvious dependencies amoung current CPU
notifier handlers, though the same-order up/down traversal still seems to
me to be an accident waiting to happen.  However, this is independent of
the method to be used to bring CPUs up and down.
And yes, I did in fact suffer severe trauma due to same-order up/down
traversal in a previous life, involving (among other things) CPUs
attempting to do useful work with out-of-date TLBs and attempting to
execute RCU read-side critical sections on CPUs that were no longer
participating in grace-period processing.  Not pretty.  :-/  But I don't
immediately see similar issues in Linux at the moment (with the caveat
that I can't claim to be expert in every area using CPU notifiers), and
if such problems do arise, it is pretty easy to provide reverse-order
down traversal.  The fact that RCU doesn't stop grace-period processing
until CPU_DEAD is at least somewhat comforting to me.  ;-)
So the thought is to make _cpu_down() and _cpu_up() do something like
the following (untested, probably does not even compile), perhaps with
suitable adjustments elsewhere as well?
	static int _cpu_down(unsigned int cpu)
	{

					__FUNCTION__, cpu);

			goto out_freeze_notify_failed;

		/* Ensure that we are not runnable on dying cpu */
		old_allowed = current->cpus_allowed;

		/* This actually kills the CPU. */
		__cpu_die(cpu);
		/* Move it here so it can run. */
		kthread_bind(p, get_cpu());
		put_cpu();
		/* CPU is completely dead: tell everyone.  Too late to complain. */
		if (raw_notifier_call_chain(&cpu_chain, CPU_DEAD,
				(void *)(long)cpu) == NOTIFY_BAD)
			BUG();
		check_for_tasks(cpu);
	out_thread:
		err = kthread_stop(p);
	out_allowed:

	static int __devinit _cpu_up(unsigned int cpu)
	{

		if (cpu_online(cpu) || !cpu_present(cpu))

		ret = raw_notifier_call_chain(&cpu_chain, CPU_UP_PREPARE, hcpu);
		if (ret == NOTIFY_BAD) {
			printk("%s: attempt to bring up CPU %u failed\n",
					__FUNCTION__, cpu);
			ret = -EINVAL;
			goto out_notify;
		}
		/* Arch-specific enabling code. */
		mutex_lock(&cpu_bitmask_lock);
		ret = __cpu_up(cpu);
		mutex_unlock(&cpu_bitmask_lock);
		if (ret != 0)
			goto out_notify;
		BUG_ON(!cpu_online(cpu));
		/* Now call notifier in preparation. */
		raw_notifier_call_chain(&cpu_chain, CPU_ONLINE, hcpu);
	out_notify:
