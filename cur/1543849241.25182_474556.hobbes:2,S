It was supposed to be correct in the NF5 reference BIOS, but somehow Asus
must have managed to break the reference BIOS.

That was impossible at the point where it was implemented.

They use the RTC interrupt for timing instead AFAIK so a broken interrupt 0
won't affect them. That's probably why we have so many problems with
interrupt 0 on cheap systems.
I tried it once to use in Linux too BTW, but it unfortunately cannot generate
any of the standard Linux timer frequencies.
