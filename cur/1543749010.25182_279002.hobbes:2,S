If you use that RTC timer, it needs to be something that can be
turned OFF. Many embedded applications use that because its the
only timer that the OS doesn't muck with. It also has very low
noise which makes in a good timing source for IIR filters for
high precision, low data-rate data acquisition (like 24 bits).
Since it generates an edge, its interrupt can't be shared.
I certainly hope that you don't use it. One can read the
time without disturbing the interrupt rate. One just
needs to use the existing rtc_lock and not spin with
the lock being held.
Currently the kernel RTC software allocates the RTC interrupt
even though it doesn't use it. This makes it necessary to
compile the RTC as a module and then remove it when another
driver needs to use the RTC interrupt source.
