I read the Documentation/ioctl-number.txt file and 0x35 is not mentioned
in this file. But I made a grep on 'MAGIC' and '35' in the Linux source
tree and you're right, this number is already used by POR_MAGIC_2. 
Is a grep in the Linux source tree is enough to know if the value is
unique?
Thanks,
Guillaume
