I tried from 2.6.13-rc2-mm2 up to 2.6.13-rc4-mm1 and always get the following
error when applying this patch:

The first errors I was able to resolve by placing the function prototype
definitions (line 113 and 114) outside the function. I am using gcc 4.0.1.
But the errors in line 505 onwards I don't know what to do. Should I take
an earlier -mm release?
Thanks,
Holger
