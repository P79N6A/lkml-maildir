 Bizarre - it panic'd again last Thursday while I was in X, but I
still didn't manage to log any output.  At the weekend, I had the
bright idea of using chattr +j on the syslog to try to journal any
data, since then it has been fine.  So, it isn't down to highmem, and
I still can't trigger it reliably, or get any trace.  Tried running
as x86_64 this morning (because cold starts on Thursdays seem
particularly problematic, perhaps it's a time/power-supply-noise
problem), then x86 from a cold start this afternoon.
 Time to hope it won't bite me too often, and move on to testing
2.6.20-rc6.
