Thanks.  It is perhaps the jiffies calibration taking a while because of 
the precise timing loop.  Are you reasonably confident that it is a 
regression in performance over 2.6.17?  The boot sequence is pretty 
complicated, and a lot of it is difficult / slow to virtualize, so it 
could just be alternate timing makes the boot output appear to stall, 
when in fact the raw time is still about the same.  I will run some 
experiments.
