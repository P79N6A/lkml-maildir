An idea would be to lock/mark the block in the buffer, so it wont be used by
kernel. And then userspace can read out the locked buffers and decide what
to do (like writing to it). Especially good would it be, if user space can
get all details about the expected content (like inode/redir/dentry/data
block of file x).
