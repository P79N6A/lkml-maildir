I'm in the process of trying that Neil, but if thats the case, it 
means I cannot ever re-use that nic in another machine here.  What 
I'd druther do if this test proves positive, is to figure out howto 
get the arp tables updated on the firewall so they reflect the new 
MAC address for this machine.  I've got both drivers as modules 
effective with the next reboot so the testing switching will be much 
easier.
Thanks for the shoulder to cry on.
