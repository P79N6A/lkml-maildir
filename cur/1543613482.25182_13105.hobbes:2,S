Hi all.
I have usb-only system here: MB: sis735; Keyboard: cherry 3000 USB and
a Logitech Pilot USB mouse.
When I press num-lock the first time after boot-up or often after switching
between X and a VC (Matrox-FB) my system hangs for a second (even sound-
stops) and I get this message:
Dec 15 14:01:19 jackson kernel: keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?(ed)
Dec 15 14:01:19 jackson kernel: keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?(f4)
With my last Asus k7m maiboard and the same hardware (internal and external)
I got this messages not that often - and I never had such hangs where even
the sound stops ...
Any idea??
