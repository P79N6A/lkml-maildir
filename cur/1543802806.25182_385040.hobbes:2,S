This patch looks ok as well, although would you consider renaming
time_adj to something like phase_adj? Also maybe include a larger
comment about how tick_nsec and phase_adj store the ntp adjustment, just
to make it obvious that they are the cumulative result of the adjtimex()
offset, freq, tick and singleshot offset values?
