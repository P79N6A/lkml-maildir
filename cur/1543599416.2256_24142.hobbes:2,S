Subject: skb->dev set redundantly in net/ipv4/arp.c:arp_send()

Hello,
I think skb->dev is being set twice, for no purpose,
in net/ipv4/arp.c:489 and net/ipv4/arp.c:563. The
only external calls between these lines are memcpy
and dev->hard_header, and neither of those will ever
change skb->dev. So we can get rid of the redundant
"skb->dev = dev" line right before dev_queue_xmit()
unless I'm really stupid :-)
Anyway, here's my proposed patch against 2.4.9:
--- net/ipv4/arp-orig.c Tue Aug 28 17:36:45 2001
+++ net/ipv4/arp.c      Tue Aug 28 17:38:52 2001

                 memset(arp_ptr, 0, dev->addr_len);
         arp_ptr+=dev->addr_len;
         memcpy(arp_ptr, &dest_ip, 4);
-       skb->dev = dev;
         dev_queue_xmit(skb);
         return;
