I have just added one more commit from Kumar's merge branch, so when
you pull the diffstat should be:
 arch/powerpc/boot/dts/mpc8349emitx.dts |   16 ++++++++--------
 arch/powerpc/kernel/dma.c              |    1 +
 2 files changed, 9 insertions(+), 8 deletions(-)
If you had already pulled, please pull again, or pull Kumar's merge
branch directly.
Thanks,
Paul.
