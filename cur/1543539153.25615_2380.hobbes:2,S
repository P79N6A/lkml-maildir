Hi,
A while ago, someone was posting interesting SMP lock contention profiles
and contention points.
I'm curious what such a profile looks like now that various bits of the
VFS and particularly the dcache, have been fine-grain SMP locked. You have
to wonder if there are any big contentions left ;-)
Cheers
Chris
