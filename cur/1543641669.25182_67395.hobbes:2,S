   Patrik Mochel noticed that fs/aio.c doesn't compile on a non-highmem config.  
   The patch below (and in the bk tree on master.kernel.org:/home/bcrl/aio-2.5) 
   fixes that by making the helper functions #defines, and should also be a 
   bit faster.
Platforms should fix this by making a dummy asm/kmap_types.h
Linus added the explicit include of asm/kmap_types.h and therefore
I believe this is how he wants this fixed too.
