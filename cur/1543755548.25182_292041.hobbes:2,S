Ignoring your hint for a moment, since __KERNEL__ is still scattered all
over the place, and I haven't see anything (changeset-wise) adding "You
must use libc-kernelheaders now" in Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt
this is still an actual problem.  Thanks.
Feel free to correct me by getting something added to
Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt :)
