Subject: [PATCH] radeonfb: Fix panel detection on some laptops
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi !
The code in radeonfb looking for the BIOS image currently uses the
BIOS ROM if any, and falls back to the RAM image if not found. This
is unfortunatly not correct for a bunch of laptops where the real
panel data are only present in the RAM image.
This works around this problem by preferring the RAM image on mobility
chipsets. This is definitely not the best workaround, we need some arch
support for linking the RAM image to the PCI ID (preferrably by having
the arch snapshot it during boot, isolating us completely from the details
of where this image is in memory). I'll see how we can get such
an improvement later.
Please apply,
