Subject: [PATCH] Patch for Toshiba 2520 Laptops
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Certain Toshiba laptop's floppy disk controllers (toshiba 2520)
occasionnally send bogus interrupts, which confuse the floppy
driver. This interrupts are easily recognizable by their
head/sector/cylinder numbers being out of range.  The following patch
instructs the floppy controller to ignore these interrupts.
Regards,
Alain
