So you check the lock, do rsync, and check the lock again. But the lock could 
have flipped several times during the rsync and you wouldn't know about it.
My preferred solution is a single sequence file as described by Adreas:
Assuming sequence starts at 0,
To modify the repository, +1 to sequence file contents, modify repo, +1 to 
sequence
To get a coherent copy,
do
	seq1 = read(sequence file)
	rsync repo
	seq2 = read(sequence file)
until seq1==seq2 and !(seq1&1)
