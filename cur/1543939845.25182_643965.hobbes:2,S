Subject: [PATCH 0/3][RFC] x86: Catch stray non-kprobe breakpoints
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greetings,
Non kprobe breakpoints in the kernel might lie inside the .kprobes.text section. Such breakpoints can easily be identified by in_kprobes_functions and can be caught early. These are problematic and a warning should be emitted to discourage them (in any rare case, if they actually occur).
For this, a check can route the trap handling of such breakpoints away from kprobe_handler (which ends up calling even more functions marked as __kprobes) from inside kprobe_exceptions_notify.
All comments/suggestions are welcome.
