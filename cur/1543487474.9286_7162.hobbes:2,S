I just got my first 2.2.x oops today. It happended while the box was
relative idle (one low-priority CPU bound process + a screen saver):
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000017 
current->tss.cr3 = 00b42000, %cr3 = 00b42000 
*pde = 00000000

As you may imagine, this took down my X server, leaving the video card
in an unknown state. The box continued to run happily for hours until I
logged in remotely and completely locked up the box by running `textmode'.
