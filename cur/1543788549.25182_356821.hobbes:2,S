John, Please don't strip the CC list.  Ingo may want to see what's
happening, and besides, it's not proper netiquette for LKML.

Here's an addon patch to my last one.  I don't know x86_64 very well, but
I believe the the asm is pretty much the same, so this patch removes the
check for __i386__ and also defines STACK_WARN.
I'm leaving for the weekend, so you are now on your own. Unless you get
help from others. ;-)
