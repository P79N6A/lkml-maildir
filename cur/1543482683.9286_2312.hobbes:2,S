Ooh, I like it. A second program could work as a proxy, making the syscall
look more 'normal' to the user-mode kernel. Replace copy_from_user, etc.,
with the ptrace equivalents in arch/userspace.

That helps with the problem of memory maps, but it has the downside that
the real kernel wants to do things like scheduling. Can the ptrace
interface let us interrupt a task when a "timer interrupt" occurs?

I assume you mean the kernel-hardware side and not the user-kernel side
(which is handled as soon as you have the syscall proxying in place).
This part is relatively easy, I think. It's an app. It's allowed to open
files. Have a file with a UMK to real device mapping, including mapping
block devices to real drives or files and you're in good shape. If we want
to go further and give real access to hardware, which might be useful when
debugging a new driver, I/O is easy, user-DMA is being worked on, and
interrupts could conceivably been down with downcalls (ew) or wacky signal
semantics, though neither would fit the normal definitions of "fast". Fast
here is probably not terribly important, since we're in a debugging
environment.
