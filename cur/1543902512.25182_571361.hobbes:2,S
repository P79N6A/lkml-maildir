Quick question:
I am currently setting up an early_printk for the Blackfin - & I'm populating
an early fault interrupt handler at the same time. This allows things like
catching interrupts, or faults before the kernel has had a chance to
enable it's standard interrupt/fault handlers which happen midway 
through the boot process.
I would like to be able to print out the standard __log_buf from my early
fault handler - so everyone can see where things are when they died. In
most situations - printk has dumped some info to the log_buf, and it is
normally handy to see figure out what is going on.
However - __log_buf & associated pointers are declared as static in
kernel/printk.c - so they can't be accessed by external files.
I would normally use do_syslog([23],...) to read from the buffer - 
but these crashes happens before the kernel is fully initialized,
so spin_lock_irq, cond_resched, or wait_event_interruptible
will cause problems...
Although there are other solutions - I would prefer to just don't declare them
as static when EARLY_PRINTK is defined. This way if something bad happens - 
everyone can dump out the standard buffers to assist in debugging...
