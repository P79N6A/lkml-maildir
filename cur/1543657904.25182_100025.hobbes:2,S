Sometime between the csets
    rddunlap@osdl.org|ChangeSet|20021218224440|38837
and
    sfr@canb.auug.org.au|ChangeSet|20030103190613|05701
compilation of ixj.ko broke.
(That is OTOO 520 csets of difference; I didn't try a compile during
the 2.5.53 timeframe.)
It looks isapnp related:

(I'd try w/o ISAPNP, but the last time I did, I ended up w/o a working
kb or mouse....)
