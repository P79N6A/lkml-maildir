For the sake of comparison, let's look at the effect of performance patch on
raw device, in place of the above three functions, we now have two:
raw_file_rw			1.59%
raw_file_aio_rw		1.19%
A total saving of 6.09% (4.97+2.70+1.20 -1.59-1.19).  That's only counting
the cpu cycles.  We have tons of other data showing significant kernel path
length reduction with the performance patch.  Cache misses reduced across
the entire 3 level cache hierarchy, that's a secondary effect can not be
ignored since kernel is also competing cache resource with application.
