  Same as with EXT2.
  In theory with 4k block size:
     (4096/4)^3 * 4096 = 4 000 GB = 4 TB
  (plus a bit more, but that is minor detail)
  Your application must use LFS extensions, e.g.
     open("filename", O_LARGEFILE, ..)
  and your  "ulimit -f"  must be "unlimited", otherwise
  you will encounter 2 GB limit of original ABI.
  Another limitation that may come and bite you, is
  underlying block device capabilities.  Prior to 2.6
  kernels any block device can not exceed 1 TB size.
  (Or 2 TB, depending...)
