I don't have a patch in hand to purely back out the eer modeule.  What I
have is
dasd-cleanup-dasd_ioctl.patch
dasd-cleanup-dasd_ioctl-fix.patch
dasd-add-per-disciple-ioctl-method.patch
dasd-merge-dasd_cmd-into-dasd_mod.patch
dasd-backout-dasd_eer-module.patch
dasd-kill-dynamic-ioctl-registration.patch
So what do we do?
