You mean you're rewriting Perl in C++?  I hope I just misunderstood..
If, however, that's what you're saying then I'll stay with the last C 
version of Perl, that's for sure.
C++ code not maintained by the original developer seems to end up 
unmaintained almost always. 
(e.g. who's been fixing groff the last years?  Nobody.  I remember 
struggling with a sick groff problem once, turned out the compiler didn't 
generate correct code for one slightly complicated statement.  There are 
far more bugs in C++ compilers, as an example look at the bug reports on 
comp.sys.sgi. The number of bug reports on C++ is one or two orders of 
magnitude higher than for the C compiler.  It won't change either, C++ 
compilers are harder to get right than C compilers.)
As far as I'm concerned I'm done with C++ forever.  Even thinking of the
fact that I thought C++ was a pretty good idea some years back is
quite embarrassing now.
