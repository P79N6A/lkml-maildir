I agree so far.  But when it's really
	if (put_user(..>)
		return -EFAULT;
	
	if (put_user(...))
		return -EFAULT;
	
	if (copy_to_user(...))
		return -EFAULT;
	
	if (copy_to_user(...))
		return -EFAULT;
	return 0;
changing the last two statements to use ? : is just confusing (acme's changes
were somewhat less extreme), don't you agree ?
