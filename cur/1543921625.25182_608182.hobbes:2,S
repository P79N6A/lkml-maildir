Subject: [PATCH] Remove double mention of Support for ACPI option
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/22/166

From: Frans Pop <elendil@planet.nl>
Current description for CONFIG_ACPI includes the word "Support" twice.
One effect of this is that in menuconfig the "--->" that indicates the 
presence of sub-options will not show up unless you have a very wide 
console.
