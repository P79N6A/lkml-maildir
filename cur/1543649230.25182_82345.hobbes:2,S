    Oh, yes, get the reason through censorship :))) That's a very
ethic way of doing things. Hey, how about blacklisting all people you
don't like from vger? If you don't like RMS posts, you have ALL right
to blacklist him from YOUR system. Censorship on vger will do no good
to Linux. Freedom doesn't get its way through censorship. Fascism do.
