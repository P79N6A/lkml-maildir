Yeah, it's a problem with religious perspectives at this point, things
can occasionally get ugly :)
I'm really glad you are speaking up, though...

Agreed -- but one can also see it just as real life, a compromise
with proven open source productivity gains.  Linus, myself, and
others have repeatedly been saying that we would use a superior free
software tool...
At the end of the day, I think the open source cause is advanced by
this non-open-source tool, because Linux kernel development (or at
least the rate of patch application) is by all measures "faster."
By extension, discouraging use of BitKeeper when it is clearly useful
potentially harms the cause of open source.

I think that's a bit unfair :(  All Linus did was add an additional
method of patch transport... the source code is still the same
bitrotten hunk of poo we all know, love, and work on :)

Pretty much my conclusion...
