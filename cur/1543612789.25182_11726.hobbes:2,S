They have identical copies of zlib, except for a typo fix in a comment in 
the PPP version which was made after I copied it. It's probably worth 
hacking the makefiles so that only one gets built and included.
In due course, the new zlib in fs/inflate_fs will get expanded to do 
compression as well as decompression, and moved out of fs/ where it doesn't 
really belong. At that point, JFFS2 and PPP can both use that.
You could prefix all the non-static symbols in either or both of these zlib 
copies with 'ppp_' or 'jffs2_', but I prefer not to do that as it's just 
hiding the problem, not fixing it.
