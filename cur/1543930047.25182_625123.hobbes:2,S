That's not good, that warning means that someone has tried to use this
kref _before_ it was initialized, so there is a logic error in the code
that was previously being papered over with the lack of this message in
the kobject code.
I do have this same message availble as a patch for the kobject core, it
would be interesting if you could just run 2.6.24-rc4 with just this
patch:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/gregkh-01-driver/kobject-warn.patch
it might take some fuzz to fit properly, but all you really want to do
is add:
	WARN_ON(atomic_read(&kobj->kref.refcount));
before the kref_init() call in kobject_init().
