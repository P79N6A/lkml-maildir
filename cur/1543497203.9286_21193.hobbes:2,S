Hello,
	A few days back I had posted a question on kernel modules
using C++. This is a related question. Please correct me if I am wrong.
	I had read somewhere that there are "userspace drivers", and that
the svgalib is an example of the same. Also, these drivers are allowed to
access standard library routines. Are there any restrictions on the
libraries that can be accessed? Where can I see examples (code) of the
same?
please mail me directly as i am not on the list.
					thanks, murali.
