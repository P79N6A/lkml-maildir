I would, but if it's a "valid concern" that gzip is a few hundred KB larger, 
and the community would not graciously receive such work, there's not much 
point, is there? :-)
Seriously, though, if I understand gzip correctly, it uses deflate/zlib 
internally. Why, in that case, does /bin/gzip not (dynamically) link against 
libz? If a first step was fixing that, a second could be linking dynamically 
against libbz2 and 'liblzma', and making it all compile-time configurable.
That should keep everybody happy.
