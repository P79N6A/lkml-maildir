I am in no way an expert on the kernel, but the discussion about
ordering just made this pop into my head: Have you considered 
multi-disk partitions (ie: raid systems)? - I assume that the current
single-dirty-list design does some "default" ordering between the
disks, which is necessary for multi-disk partitions, and the
dirty-list-per-disk design might remove it without realizing it.
