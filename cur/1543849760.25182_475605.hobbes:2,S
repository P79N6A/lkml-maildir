Calling the character device interface "procfs interface" is
misleading, so I disagree with this part of the patch:
+  Note: pktsetup uses the pktcdvd procfs interface!
The only connection pktsetup has with procfs is that it reads the
character device minor number from /proc/misc. If that number was
available somewhere else or if udev created /dev/pktcdvd/control
automatically, pktsetup wouldn't need /proc at all.
Actually, checking my FC5 installation, /dev/pktcdvd/control is
created automatically when the driver is loaded, so the /proc code in
pktsetup is only needed to cope with older distributions.
