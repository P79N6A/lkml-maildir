Yes, that solves the problems as expected. But may i kindly ask the xfs 
fs developers to put some more readable patch here,
so that its better understandable by looking at the source code? I think 
some macro would be better here, for example i used
#define TRUNC_TO_SIGNED32(x) (x & 0x7FFFFFFF)
inside xfs.h and replaced all "foo & 0x7fffffff" with 
"TRUNC_TO_SIGNED32(foo)".
Thanks for your help,
