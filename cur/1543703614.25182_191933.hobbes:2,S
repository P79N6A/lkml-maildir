Hi,
I didn't find anything in the changelog for 2.6.[01] and 2.4.2[2345]:
has the FAT32 FS bug mentioned (and successfully fixed/patched) in 
http://seclists.org/lists/linux-kernel/2003/Dec/1127.html
been included in the mainstream kernel? It destroys data on big FAT32
partitions, which is very critical for people with big external harddisks
trying to exchange data between Linux and Windows systems.
