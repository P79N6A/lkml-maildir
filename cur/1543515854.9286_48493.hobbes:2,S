I have to ask each driver if it can complete a read/write/error if there
is a hup or other event outstanding. What you are suggesting means every
time there is an event I need to ask each device twice, once including a
queue once not including a queue. I have to have conditionals in the drivers
and I slow down the normal path - which is waiting. 
Signal based I/O is definitely the right approach for scaling
