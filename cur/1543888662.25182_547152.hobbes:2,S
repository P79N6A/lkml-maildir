It turns out that the patch I originally wrote to fix this is in
conflict with one of Raphael's patches (make freezeable workqueues
singlethread) already added to 2.6.22-rc2.  So here's an updated
version for that kernel.
Andrey, Soeren, and Avuton: Please try this patch with 2.6.22-rc2 or 
later and see if it fixes your problems.
Greg, if this works then I'll send it in the proper form for a patch, 
and you can use it to replace
	usb-make-the-autosuspend-workqueue-thread-freezable.patch
