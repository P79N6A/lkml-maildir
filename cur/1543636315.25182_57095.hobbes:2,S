Hello All,
I have a 2.4.x char driver which works fine, except in boxes with lots of
memory.
user_buffer -> write() -> map_user_kiobuf() -> pci_map_sg() -> Pci DMA
I'm using the .page/.offset version of the scatterlist, but in the HIGHMEM case,
map_user_kiobuf() seems to return peculiar page addresses.
What is the state of kiobufs/HIGHMEM in 2.4.x?  Do I need to implement
a bounce buffer in the driver?  Some email correspondence indicates so,
but I would be grateful for a definitive word from the kernel folks.
TIA,
Bill Waddington
