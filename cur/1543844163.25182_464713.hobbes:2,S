A 1MB virtual area which has just one page instantiated has (amortized) 
2KB cost in page tables, while a similar 1GB mapping has 8KB cost. 
That's a 50%-200% overhead which is quite bad.  Also cache line usage is 
worse since each pte needs a full cache line (two for the 1GB version) now.
In addition, the virtual address space is not infinite. On x86-64, 
userspace has 47 bits = 128 TB, enough for 128K of these 1G mappings, so 
your program would exhaust it after allocating 128,000 buffers, which is 
less than a gigabyte of physical RAM.
