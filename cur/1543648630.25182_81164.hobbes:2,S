Well that would require that the drivers become aware of struct irqaction,
and make assumptions about how the particular arch handles interrupts.
But it's a bit academic.  ia32's request_irq() calls proc_mkdir() and
create_proc_entry().  So there's no point in feeding gfp_flags down
into request_irq or whatever.  We need to fix IDE still.
