An extract from the FAQ about C++: 
http://www.tux.org/lkml/#s1-4
"My personal view is that C++ has it's merits, and makes
object-oriented programming easier. However, it is a more complex
language and is less mature than C. The greatest danger with C++ is in
fact it's power. It seduces the programmer, making it much easier to
write bloatware. The kernel is a critical piece of code, and must be
lean and fast. We cannot afford bloat. I think it is fair to say that
it takes more skill to write efficient C++ code than C code. Not every
contributer to the linux kernel is an uber-guru, and thus will not
know the various tricks and traps for producing efficient C++ code."
Object-oriented programming is a good tool. One of many. But it
shouldn't be a religion, nor do you need to write in C++ to make use
of it. A good example of object-oriented programming done in C is the
Xt toolkit.

I'm sure lots of people have thought about this. A friend of mine and
I sat down once and did a rough design for the "K" language, which was
supposed to be "exactly like C, only better". Basically, we wanted to
cherry-pick the good bits of C++, plus add some other things. As
usual, lack of time is the enemy. Besides, what's point unless it gets
widely used, and the chance of that is small.
