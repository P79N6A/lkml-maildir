I've been off the list for a week so excuse me if this repeats what
others have reported.
I have two machines which both suffer catastrophic, and sudden,
memory leaks.
	M1 = Pentium MMX /64MB, IDE, 3c59x NIC (100 BT)
	M2 = Pentium II /128MB, IDE, Intel EtherExpress Pro (NIC) (100BT)
Both machines are NFS clients that primarily access Solaris servers.
They are both used for SW devlopment with no games, MP3, etc...
They fail in one of two ways:
1. If I'm in X then its likely to totally lock up. However, I have
had a couple failures where I could switch back to the text console
and use Alt-SysRq as described next...
2. I've also had the network interface STOP working after a 1 second pause.
(When I say 'stop', I mean I couldn't even ping). I could recover the
interface by doing a 'down' and then 'up' with 'ifconfig'.
Getting back to the memory leak... After I noticed the interface was down,
I observed that Alt-SysRq-M shows about 150000 packet buffers allocated
on my 128MB machine with basically no free memory left. (Really there
was 3 or 4 MB).
I've checked that every half-hour or so and it appears to happen
all at once. I go from 50 buffers to 150000!
I've hacked 'alloc_skb' on one machine to panic if the number of
allocated sk_buff's exceeds 1000. I'll try to get a meaning stack
trace and post it to the list. Meanwhile, its back to 2.2.10 on
the other PC.
