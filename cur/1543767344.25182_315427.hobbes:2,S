hi Gábor,
I recently installed a 2.6.10 and 2.6.11 kernel on my laptop and they
froze about 5 minutes after booting. My solution was to give those 2
options to the kernels:
lilo boot: mykernel noapic nolapic
apic and Local apic are Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller
I don't know why the local aic doesn't works in Sempron..
My laptop is an HP/Compaq with an AMD Sempron inside and a phoenix bios
HTH,
