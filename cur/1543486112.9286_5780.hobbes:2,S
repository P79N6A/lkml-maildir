Digital Unix on Alpha has a 64-bit long.  I'm assuming '32' above is
a typo, the rest of your post seemed right.
Although, if you look at the old SPEC benchmarks for Alphas, you'll find
a 4 line long list of compiler options, among them options to use 32 bit
longs and pointers.  While the Alpha is a 64-bit machine, it must have
benchmarked better as 32-bit initially.
David.
