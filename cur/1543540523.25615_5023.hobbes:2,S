USB is a master / slave system. So you can't just connect a cable between
two computers. But there are devices out there that enable this to happen
(basically a board in a cable that looks like a dumb network device to the
two computers.)
You would probably be better off using 2 USB to Ethernet devices or 2 USB
to serial devices if you really want to use USB to talk between two
computers.
Lots of good technical information about USB (including the dry specs) can
be found at 
http://www.usb.org/
The Linux USB project can be found at

Someone has done this for the uCLinux distribution. Search around for
Morton Bay, as I think this is the company that did it. I don't think it
was a full port (i.e. all of the devices and host controller
functionality) but it should be a good start for you.
Hope this helps,
