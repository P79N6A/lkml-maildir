Actually, sched_clock() should not go backwards on any one cpu, but the readings will be different between cpus.
Also, we noticed the following code is being used for sched_clock_cpu():
u64 sched_clock_cpu(int cpu)
{
        if (unlikely(!sched_clock_running))
                return 0;
        return sched_clock();
}
and is called when smp_processor_id() != cpu.
