Cool :)
For those of us not using modules, any chance of making these available
via some runtime mechanism (sysfs, perhaps)?
Also, have you looked into what it takes to read the battery from either
the wireless mouseman or the MX700?  I recently ditched my MX700 for an
MX500, as the battery life was awful after a few months... but I think
it would be a nice feature nonetheless.
Good work,
