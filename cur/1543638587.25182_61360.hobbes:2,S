You could do that by marking the pages as being there, but PROT_NONE.
On the other hand, cutting down the number of initial pagefaults (by _not_ 
doing what you suggest) migth be a bigger speedup for process startup than 
the slowdown from occasionally doing unnecessary work.
I suspect that there is some non-zero order-X (probably 2 or 3), where you 
just win more than you lose. Even for small programs.
