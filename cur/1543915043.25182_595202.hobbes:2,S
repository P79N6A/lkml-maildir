I am experiencing the similar problem on my Acer Aspire 5000 laptop -
once in a while a bunch of "APIC error on CPU0: 40(40)" messages are
showing up in dmesg.
After few experiments and a lot of googling, I identified a cause - it
was my built-in wireless card! Disabling IO-APIC helped, besides a
single "Spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7" message while booting up there
was nothing unusual.
A did some further experiments on various hardware and from my
experience I can tell that "APIC error" messages are entirely hardware
related.
Regards,
Konstantin
