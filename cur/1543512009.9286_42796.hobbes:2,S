   Sure, and this is after those people have just finished chastising
   Linux for being an old-fashioned monolithic kernel when it's painfully
   obvious that microkernels are the only way to write an operating
   system.
   And they might actually be right, at least as far as their needs
   go.   In the real world, different approaches work in different
   situations, and there are cases where having inconsistant
   interfaces are better than having a unified access method to varying
   sorts of data on a system.
   Unfortunately linux, even with the current black-magic method of
   doing devices (the device equivalent of rooting through /dev/kmem
   to do ps), is a traditional Unix where most everything is a file.

   Who cares?
   I certainly don't;  /proc is fast enough even for the various
   386s I run Linux on, and if I don't want to use those cycles
   I just won't mount /proc.

   david parsons \bi/  Though I shouldn't really mention proc, because
                  \/  then people will start arguing that if /dev/kmem
		        was good enough for them, it's good enough for
