Erm... What will happen if we will go for connect/timeout/close loop when
there is no accepts on listening side. We *are* below the opened files
limit. And if I read the unix_release_sock() right we do not remove
corresponding skb's from the listen queue. Oh, fsck! It may explain the
unix_gc() breakage - we may end up doing funny things to dead sockets.
What about
