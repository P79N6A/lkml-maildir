Rats! Someone _did_ come up with something terrible. The ide-stuff
wasn't compiling at all. So after putting a big brown paper-bag over my
head and poking two holes in it to be able to see, I sat down with a
fresh tree and tried to compile every damn option. The result is a
2.0.39pre8 which probably has as many warnings as before (oh, I removed
one, in xd.c) but _hopefully_ no non-compilable drivers. Notice,
however, that I only tried compiling the x86-stuff (due to lack of other
hardware.)
