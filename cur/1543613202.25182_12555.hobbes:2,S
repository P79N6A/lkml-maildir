I look forward to this stuff.  2.4 mainline falls down reliably and
completely when running updatedb on systems with a large number of used
inodes.  Linus' VM/mmap patch helped a ton, but between general VM
issues and the i/dcache bloat I'm hoping that I won't have to redirect
my irritated users' ire into a karma pool to get these changes merged
into mainline where all of the knowledgeable folks here can beat out the
details.
I do think that the vast majority of users don't see this issue on
small-ish UP desktops.  But I'm about to buy >100 SMP systems for
production expansion which will most likely be effected by this issue.
For me that emphasizes that these so-called corner cases really are
show-stoppers for Linux-as-more-than-toy.
Gimme the /proc interface (bdflush?) and lets bang on this stuff in
mainline.  I need to stick with the latest -pre so I can track progress,
so 2.4.17pre4aa1 (or 10_vm-19) hasn't been a possibility for me... :-(
Cheers, just venting,
