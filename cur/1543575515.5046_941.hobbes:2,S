Hi,
related to my question about having nanoseconds in xtime for Linux 2.5, 
two (or three) people were interested, or at least managed to route 
their message to me. As promised I have made an early release patch 
against 2.4.0test11 available at
ftp.kernel.org:/pub/linux/daemons/ntp/PPS/pps-2.4-pre1.tar.bz2 (63kB, 
patch + digital signature)
The modified sources compile, link and boot (for arch/i386), but 
consider this code as alpha quality, and don't use it for production 
use. It is possible that it works perfectly, but I simply don't have 
the experience.
Fixes for any architectures are appreciated. Finally I want to get rid 
of gettimeoffset() and a lot of redundant code.
I noticed that the ATM drivers access xtime directly. If jiffies are 
not fine enough, do_gettimeofday() has to be called for now. If that's 
too slow, we have to think about an alternative.
Regards,
Ulrich
