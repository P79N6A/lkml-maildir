I'm finding it hard to figure out what the underling principle for the 
way you're queuing things by reading the code (that's the trouble with 
reading the code it just tells you what's being done not why -- and 
sometimes it's even hard to figure out what's being done when there's a 
lot of indirection).  sched-design-CFS.txt isn't much help in this area 
either.
Any chance of a brief description of how it's supposed to work?
Key questions are:
How do you decide the key value for a task's position in the queue?
Is it an absolute time or an offset from the current time?
How do you decide when to boot the current task of the queue?  Both at 
wake up of another task and in general play?

PS I think that you're trying to do too much in one patch.
