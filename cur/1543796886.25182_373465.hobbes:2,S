What about just making the i386 one Russell posted generic?  It shouldn't
be any less broken than what we do now and every architecture that needs
something more specific can implements it.

this isn't in mainline yet, is it?

How do you get coherent SG-buffers?  The only way to get coherent dma
allocations is dma_alloc_coheren (and the pci variant), but that's not
handing back an SG list.  But even if you build one yourself it should
be handled by dma_mmap_coherent.

What API do you think about?  If you do alloc_page yourself and use
vmap everything gets much much easier.  And with the new vm_install_page
this becomes pretty easy:
init_routine()
{
	...
	for (i = 0; i < NR_PAGES; i++) {
		pages[i] = alloc_page(GFP_KERNEL);
		...
	}
	dma_buffer = vmap(pages, ...);
}
dma_map()
{
	for (i = 0; i < NR_PAGES; i++) {
		dma_map_page(pages[i, ....);
		...
	}
}
mmap()
{
	for (i = 0; i < NR_PAGES; i++) {
		vm_insert_page(..., pages[i], ..);
		...
	}
}
maybe some tiny helpers that encapsulate the loop over the pages would
be nice, but we shouldn't need much of a new API here.
