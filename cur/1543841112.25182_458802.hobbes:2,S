The PIT clocksource is available for those situations, but is one of the
lowest rated clocksources, so anything else will be used if its
available.

Yea. With the exception of NUMAQ almost every i386 SMP system either can
use the TSC or has an alternative clocksource (acpi pm, hpet, cyclone).

Let me know if you have any questions or thoughts about it.
