The tagging of BIOs with set_buffer_ordered() or WRITE_BARRIER is a little
awkward.
Take the case of an ext2 fsync() or even an ext3 fsync() which frequently
will not trigger a commit.  If we must perform the barrier by tagging the
final BIO, that will be tricky to implement.  I could set some new field in
struct writeback_control and rework the mpage code, but working out "this
is the final BIO for this operation" is a fairly hard thing to do. 
sys_sync() would require even more VFS surgery.
Generally, it would be much preferable to use the blkdev_issue_flush() API.
What is the status of that?
