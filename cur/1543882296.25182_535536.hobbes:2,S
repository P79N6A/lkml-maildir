Well it tells userspace about pm_ops->enter/prepare/finish etc.
Also, it seems that it needs a "release memory now" operation instead of
just releasing it when the fd is closed?

I'm pretty sure there won't be, but there's no way to do it cleanly
without pm_ops since even acpi doesn't do this all the time but only
when some set of conditions is true. Hence, it needs to be able to
determine the availability of the platform mode at run time rather than
build time (build time => we could use weak symbols, arch hooks, ...)
