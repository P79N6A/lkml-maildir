My bad, I got confused; with TCP I get the hangs, with UDP the data
corruption. Unfortunately it doesn't want to hang for me me right now.

but I have two different tasty cases of data corruption using NFS over
UDP traced for you which I'll send you in private. The first one
corrupts init so that it segfaults, the second one probably crashes the
rc starter to that I'm left with an unusable getty login on console.
I'll try to get the TCP problems traced as well but right now I don't
have the time to wait....
