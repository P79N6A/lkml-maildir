Hello
I'm not quite sure where the right place is to go with this, so now
I'm asking here.  Hope you can help.
I have a ~1TB filesystem that failed to mount today, the message is:
EXT3-fs error (device loop0): ext3_check_descriptors: Block bitmap for
group 2338 not in group (block 1607003381)!
EXT3-fs: group descriptors corrupted !
Yesterday it worked flawlessly.
What's the problem, and what's the best course of action?
(cc appreciated, as I'm not subscribed!)
