I'd mentioned it a few times in the context of mcore, but probably 
didn't explain myself clearly enough then.

Yes, this fits the model we need.

Yes, that bit of memory save logic exists in the mcore mechanism. These
pages are saved away in compressed form in memory and written out
later after dump.  
Now to avoid these pages from being used by the new kernel until
the dump is safetly written out to disk, mcore patches some of
the initialization code to mark these pages (containing saved
dump) as reserved.

Great !
