Mister Manuel Abraham,
1. You utmost personally are responsible for 4 ununsable kernels, as far as bt8xx cards are concerned: 2.6.13, 2.6.14, 2.6.15, 2.6.16!
2. You did not even want to imply to resolve that issue by incarnating that "community and synergy principle" that linux community needs to exist at all, but you just perverted it by flaming capable people - and in so far I personally would deeply recommend you to shut up now and go to hell (where you belong) without any thinkable return ticket as you are nothing else but just another motherfucker...
3. You have been ignoring my contributions out of a gesture of ignorance and arrogance and incapability of every kind of human skills for months now, and I will never even try to have any mercy for that
4. Your effort of making dvb-bt8xx cards independent from bttv has been dying out of your personified asociality, ignorance, and anti-communicative behaviour - thus the very hopeful cx878 project is another dead born child produced by your personal behaviour, asociality, ignorance, stupidity and incompatibility, with the effect that Christoph Pfister has turned off from that development tree and now is maintainer of kaffeine where he is doing a very good job, neglecting any further cooperation with you deeply asocial human being in pure incarnation
5. Mister Manuel Abraham, I am not alone just to say that I want you to vanish and shrink from here without any return ticket at all
Go to hell, Manuel Abraham, and do not return at all to absolutely no thinkable condition at all, and never come back to this place once more again
Just goto hell, you goddamn deeply asocial miserable sonofabitch!!
Uwe
