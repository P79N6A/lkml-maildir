Hi,
	Can you check if your processor has the cpuid instruction.  If it
doesn't, there is no way to determine if it is in fact a i486DX-25/33 [1]. 
Probably Linux 2.0 defaulted to that name (IOW it was lying).  A small C
code is attached to verify that.
	Cheers,
		Rafael
[1] The processor ID register is returned EDX just after RESET, of course
there is no way Linux can get to the value.
