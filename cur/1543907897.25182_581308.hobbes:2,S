I'd be *much* happier with "atomic_read()" doing the "volatile" instead.
The fact is, volatile on data structures is a bug. It's a wart in the C 
language. It shouldn't be used. 
Volatile accesses in *code* can be ok, and if we have "atomic_read()" 
expand to a "*(volatile int *)&(x)->value", then I'd be ok with that.
But marking data structures volatile just makes the compiler screw up 
totally, and makes code for initialization sequences etc much worse.
