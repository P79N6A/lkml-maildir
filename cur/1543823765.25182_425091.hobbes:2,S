the problem is that Linux considers these 'free game' and will happily put
something like IO windows for cardbus cards there.

MCFG is none of these...

no their bug is mostly that MCFG is garbage in those bioses. It points plain to
the wrong place. They even reserved the correct range, just pointed mcfg at the
wrong place.
