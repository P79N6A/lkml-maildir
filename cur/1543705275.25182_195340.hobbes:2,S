Hi everyone,
I was looking at fs/reiserfs/inode.c, and I noticed that the functions 
sd_attrs_to_i_attrs and i_attrs_to_sd_attrs are not exact inverses: 
i_attrs_to_sd_attrs doesn't convert the S_APPEND flag to 
REISERFS_APPEND_FL, but sd_attrs_to_i_attrs does convert 
REISERFS_APPEND_FL to S_APPEND. I was wondering, is this intentional?
