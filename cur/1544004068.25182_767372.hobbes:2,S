Well, this is the issue discussed in the past several times...
The most of SCSI drivers are fine; they can handle IOMMU mapping
failure properly or panic. But there are some network drivers that
don't even check the failure. Fixing these network drivers has been on
my todo list... But as I said before, we ignore this problem; only
swiotlb and SBA panic in the case of IOMMU mapping failure.
