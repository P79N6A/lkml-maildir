Not entirely. Part of it was to improve for !MMU use, and part of it was it
looked like I could improve it in general both by making it more readable and
by things such as making page->private available on the head page.
Linus suggested adding a CONFIG_COMPOUND_PAGE or something similar. By making
half of the compound page stuff mandatory I could also get rid of some
#ifdefs[*] for what appears to be a small overhead when allocating high-order
pages when HUGETLBFS is not defined by making use of the fact that we'd be
tickling the cache over the secondary page structures anyway.
[*] People seem to want to give me the impression that #ifdefs are evil and
    should all be buried at least 10 feet down:-)
This in turn provides a way to simplify a number of other things, such as the
"free_pages" functions.
There should be no overhead on single page handling when
ENHANCED_COMPOUND_PAGES is not set. If it is set, then the overhead is pretty
much the same as for hugetlbfs being compiled in now.
> The current compound page logic should handle that quite happily, no?
The current compound page implementation takes page->private away. What I've
done gives it back, currently at the cost of one page flag bit, but there are
ways around even that.
