Am I missing something? That would make it two file types, no? I bet
there's more overhead in handling that problem than just writing the time.

find -anewer seems to use as much resolution as it has. More to the point,
what is the overhead of updating the time when an i/o is done? It would
seem pretty trivial.
If you are willing to give up a flag bit you could store the time in some
native unit (machine type dependent) when an i/o is done, then do the
convert to ns when it's used, such as compare, close, etc. You could have
an inode walker thread do the convert in background if that seems needed.
There are probably other ways to reduce overhead, those just came to mind.
I think it's a pretty low impact problem with some effort on making it so.

As you say, but good that you brought it up!
