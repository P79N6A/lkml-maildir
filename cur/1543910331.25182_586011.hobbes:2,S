Andrew,
Four bug fixes on the dirty inode lists :-)
They can be put immediately after the patch file named
writeback-fix-periodic-superblock-dirty-inode-flushing.patch:
[PATCH 1/6] writeback: fix time ordering of the per superblock inode lists 8
[PATCH 2/6] writeback: fix ntfs with sb_has_dirty_inodes()
[PATCH 3/6] writeback: remove pages_skipped accounting in __block_write_full_page()
[PATCH 4/6] writeback: introduce writeback_control.more_io to indicate more io
Also the check_dirty_inode_list.patch should be updated in place:
[PATCH 5/6] check dirty inode list
And this one is required to avoid warnings from the above debug patch:
[PATCH 6/6] prevent time-ordering warnings
Although not yet tested in highly parallel write workloads, I'm pretty sure
that the time ordering bug is gone :)
Thank you,
Fengguang
