Just tried another 8139D card, same make, and it shows up as a 10ec:8139
instead of the 00ec.  Bad bit, indeed.
So I've got a card that has a wrong PCI id, I wonder what Windows would do
if i installed it there.  I wonder if I have more of these to test.  Found
another one.  I'll test THIS one too :)

Thanks :)  How about a note in the C+ things that D isn't higher than C+
then.
