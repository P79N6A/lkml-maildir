Well - it is good for what I need it for: unioning normal filesystem
with podfuk extensions. You don't really want to see extended files on
ls, anyway. (I.e. if I do ls I want to see
-rwxr-xr-x file.tar
but do _not_ want to see
drwxr-xr-x file.tar#utar
). Ok then, maybe it is not as strong as true union mount, but union
mount should be enough for me, that's why I'm interested. And example
shows it is not _that_ hard to write.
