Subject: Setting the CDROM speed in 2.0.36

What system call (if one exists) is used for setting the speed
(1x, 2x, 4x, etc..) of an IDE ATAPI CDROM drive?
I'm using the 2.0.36 kernel, and I know 2.2.x has an ioctl or
something, but I want to do it in 2.0.36.  If it is possible,
please tell me how, and if possible forward it to the cdwrite
list at:  cdwrite@other.debian.org
Also, please indicate if it works with the cdrom.o driver, or the
ide-scsi driver, or both.  If each does it differently, please
indicate how to do it in both. 
Thanks very much in advance.
