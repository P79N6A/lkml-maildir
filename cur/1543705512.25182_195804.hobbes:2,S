Are you sure about this?  I know the driver uses the discs as a standard IDE 
controller, but then it can deliberately put the chip into a bypass mode.
According to the blurb it is "Different from using traditional software to 
handle the RAID function, IT8212F features one embedded CPU and firmware to 
handle it. The methodology is able to improve the system's stability and 
reduce the driver's loading".  The block diagram shows an embeded CPU.  It is 
also possible, depending on the firmware it is programmed with to make it a 
RAID or ATAPI controller.

It's the IT8211 that is the simple IDE controller.

Anyway, now I've said that, any more news on it's support?  I'd be very 
interested in trying out any code that may be being developed, especially if 
it will work with x86-64 in long mode.  The current driver from ITE 
definitely and unsurprisingly does not.
