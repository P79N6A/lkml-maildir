That's what I did originally. Unfortunately, it breaks both libc5 and
glibc. In the case of libc5, every time you compile a program, you are
including header files from the kernel source tree (normally installed in
/usr/include/linux and /usr/include/asm). If we were to change the types
of uid_t and gid_t directly in the kernel, then anyone trying to compile a
program would be using the wrong sizes and would end up with a miscompiled
program.
This is why we needed the following ugly construction in
include/linux/types.h:
#ifdef __KERNEL__
typedef __kernel_uid32_t	uid_t;
typedef __kernel_gid32_t	gid_t;
#else
typedef __kernel_uid_t		uid_t;
typedef __kernel_gid_t		gid_t;
#endif /* __KERNEL__ */

This is quite deliberate. If we were to change the type of __kernel_uid_t,
and you recompiled glibc, you would *not* get a working glibc, you would
get a glibc that worked only partially and caused various programs to
crash. Even worse, if you tried to use this glibc on a system with an
older kernel, every program would crash.
Old versions of glibc simply do not expect the type of __kernel_uid_t to
change.
Instead, we added a new type, __kernel_uid32_t, and new system calls
(sys_setuid32, sys_chown32, etc.). Old versions of glibc do not know about
these, and will continue to work properly if compiled against newer kernel
headers.
Future versions of glibc will check to see if __kernel_uid32_t is defined
when they are being compiled, and if so, will include everything that is
necessary to make use of 32-bit UIDs on new kernels, and still work
properly on older ones.
I'll post a message to the kernel list when I have a patch for glibc 2.1
for testing. The older patches on my web site do not yet work for the
32-bit UID support now in Linux 2.3.
Thanks,
