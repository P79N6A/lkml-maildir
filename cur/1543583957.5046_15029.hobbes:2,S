Your driver uses the new PCI probe code, so there is no gaurantee that you'll
see channel A before channel B.  So, if you haven't seen channel A yet, you
won't already have read the Channel B Primary bit in the SEEPROM.  So, my
guess would be that you should modify the code so that when presented with the
B or C channel of a device, maybe you should make a call to load_seeprom() (or
whatever it is in your driver) for Channel A, grab the bits you need that are
only on channel A's SEEPROM, save them off, then read the Channel B/C SEEPROM
entry as needed.  That should solve the problem anyway.  Of course, it could
simply be something else that is wrong and I could be smoking crack ;-)
