I have no problem with you having a different opinion, I have a problem 
with your childish behaviour. :-(
You completely ignore the rest of my mail, trying to establish some base 
definitions, which would help to figure out the options we have based on 
the spec. You instead just insist on your interpretation without going 
into any detail.

You still don't explain, how you you get to this conclusion based on the 
spec. Instead you redefine it now to useful assupmtions for application
programmers who can't read the spec...
You still completely leave the question unanswered of the possibility of 
different resolutions. We can still discuss what resolution to return with 
clock_getres(), but first we have to establish with what kind of resoltion 
we're dealing with here.

Why are they doing this kind of calculations based on this value?
We can discuss returning a reasonable value for these applications, but I 
don't see how these assumptions should control how the kernel works.

The rounding is done based on your interpretation of the spec, which you 
refuse to discuss. AFAICT the spec leaves enough room to avoid this 
rounding completely.
