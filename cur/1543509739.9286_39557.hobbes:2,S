SIGIO (and realtime SIGIO too) is only defined for socket-style, pipe,
or certain char-mode file descriptors, not for regular files.  SIGIO is
_always_ associated with a fd capable of running in O_NONBLOCK mode, and
is intended to be used with O_NONBLOCK.

Not if you have O_NONBLOCK set.

It's called "si_value", and it just so happens that the siginfo address
used for si_value is not used by either si_band or si_fd.  We could add
this if we stored the value in every async file descriptor and added an
ioctl to set it.

Indeed.  :)  There is, however, no way to flush a given fd's signals in
the current kernels.  All you can do is flush all signals of a given
signum (by temporarily setting the handler to SIG_DFL).
