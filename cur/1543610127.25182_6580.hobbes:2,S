I presume IEEE station address == MAC...
I haven't really much choice. I can't use modules for
security reasons; I have to assign the motherboard MAC
to eth0 because a commercial package we are installing
licenses on the MAC address of eth0.  
Ifconfig cannot, to my knowledge, swap the identify of
eth0 and eth1. However I the iproute2 calls, if they are
available, might do the trick. I will have to see.
The only thing I really have control over is the kernel
itself, not the dist even.
Has the pci=reverse option been removed? That might
have done the trick.
Also, I don't really see anything inherently wrong with
being able to force some of these things at the boot
command line.
