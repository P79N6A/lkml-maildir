Instrumentation primarity aims at debugging user-space applications by
giving the ability to extract information across execution layers, hence
being a feature useful to users, not only kernel hackers. Therefore I
strongly doubt that it belongs to the kernel hacking submenu. It today's
world, where we face complex user-space problems involving
multithreaded, multiprocesses applications, the kernel and
hypervisors, running on many cores, this kind of tool has proven useful
to many, not only kernel developers. Please have a look at the
papers (especially the OLS2007 paper) linked on 
http://ltt.polymtl.ca
 as a
starting point if you are intereted in the question.
But yes, it can also be useful to kernel debugging, amongst other
things.
