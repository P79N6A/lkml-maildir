Exactly, but the block layer (and I'd have to trace back through the
code to find the exact failure point) has a check somewhere in there
that checks the direction, and if it's a WRITE, checks data_len, and
fails if it is 0.
Note, my patch does not fix the case for the bug if I leave it as WRITE.
It only works when it is READ.

Yes, I know these patches. I was in the Cc when they were all being
discussed. It's has nothing to do with my patch. It's the commands that
are required. It's not about the bug in the SCSI layer.

Write permissions is not enough.
