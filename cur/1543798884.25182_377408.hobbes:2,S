 From 2.6.14 md has at least minimal support for write barriers.
 'Minimal support' means that it will tell the filesystem, that write
 barriers aren't supported so it should do explicit cache flushes
 (however I don't believe that all filesystems to the explicit cache
 flushes that they should).
 From 2.6.15, md/raid1 has better support for write barriers, in that
 if every underlying device supports them, it will preserve the
 write-barrier flag in requests passed down.
 So you should be ok with the write cache if you use raid1 and 2.6.15
 (which isn't out yet, I know, but a late -rc should be fine).  But if
 you want a different raid level, you should ask the ext3 developers
 if there is a reason they don't call blkdev_issue_flush if barriers
 aren't supported...
