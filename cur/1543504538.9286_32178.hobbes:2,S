Subject: IPIP tunneling from 2.2.7 to 2.0.36  ?

a fried tried to upgrade one `end' of a working IPIP tunnel from 2.0.36 to 2.2.7
(the other side can't be rebooted/upgraded yet) and now IPIP tunneling 
doesn't work anymore.
to be more exact: it works fine from the 2.0.x side (telnet/ping is ok)
but starting from the 2.2.x side there is no response to ping or telnet or whatever.
are there any incompatibilities between 2.0.x and 2.2.x  tunneling, or can this
be a configuration error ?  device setup and routing seems to be ok from what 
he explained and told me on the phone).
thanks for any ideas/hints,
Harald
