While I agree in general, perhaps a different approach would work
better.  For instance, we could blacklist a few known-bad device
classes (maybe even using the existing blacklist) rather than
whitelisting a few known-good ones -- or trying to blacklist each 
member of the bad classes!
Also, building something this sweeping into a kernel driver feels like
a mistake.  It ought to be more easily configurable from userspace, say
via a sysfs file.  Although this wouldn't be so important if we take
the blacklist-classes route.
