Hi!
I know that X runs suid root, but I think that processes even when suid
root have to call an ioperm system call for these io-addresses which
they want to use. So when X has access only to the addresses of the
graphics card, it should receive SIGSEGV when trying to write to the
timer. Maybe I am wrong. But I think even a root process shouldn't have
the rights to write to anywhere by default until it has asked the kernel
for permissions to do that for a specified adress space.
Greetings, Michael
PS: After fixing the bug in my X-server, my system runs OK now. Thank
you all for your help.
