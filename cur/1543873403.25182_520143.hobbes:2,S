Well, I think you're trying to get both the cake and the money for it.
You use a vendor-specific stable kernel in order to get a high reliability
and good hardware support, but without paying for the customer support
associated with it, and when you have a problem you ask for free help
here where people don't know much about it (except for those who worked
on it).
By trying to get all advantages, you're in the worst situation : you have
a bug with a kernel that nobody knows except the vendor, and you can't
beat the vendor for this. I don't know if CentOS offers community-based
support through mailing lists or such, but maybe you'd loose less time
and money by buying the smallest support contract from RH and ask them
to help you on this problem.

Nope, it was initially written for 2.4 by Rik van Riel, and supported
for a long time as a patch for these kernels. Later it got merged in
2.4-ac which became a base for RHEL3. It was also merged in 2.6 but
I believe that it got important changes, though I'm not sure.

I'm not sure that many people here will be able to provide you with much
help, unfortunately.
