That's a bit of an unhelpful suggestion.
flush_dcache_page() exists to support coherency problems with virtual
aliasing and a feature of that is that you have to flush every
inequivalent user address which might be cached, hence the need for list
traversal.
Exactly why wouldn't a simple spinlock to protect page->mapping work?  I
know we don't want to bloat struct page, but such a thing could go in
struct address_space?
