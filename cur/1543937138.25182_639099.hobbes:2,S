That's not a kernel version problem.
The TSCs on the CPUs are not synchronized, which means we can observe
time going backwards when we read TSC on one and then on another CPU.
TSC is switched off due to this.
This is also unrelated to HPET. If there would be no HPET available we
would use some other clocksource instead. On this box we use HPET
because it's the best clocksource we have in the system.
