Even better, use the "ltrace" command. It's like strace, but for library
calls, and it doesn't need debug symbols. The web page is at
http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/utils/ltrace.html
Example: I ltrace my netscape:
$ ltrace -p 1397
XFindContext(0x0880c800, 0x089aca00, -1, 0xbfffe480, 3) = 0
XtGetSubvalues(0x089ad500, 0x08812800, 21, 0x08b3bca0, 1 <unfinished ...>
ffs(0x80000000, 88, 21, 0x08726a78, 7 <unfinished ...>
--- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) ---
gettimeofday(0xbfffe28c, 0, 0x084d94c8, 0x4029acc0, 0) = 0
__errno_location()                                = 0x4029acc0
breakpointed at 0x08136253 (?)
ffs(0x80000000, 88, 21, 0x08726a78, 7)            = 32
XrmStringToQuark(0x08751ed8, 0x08750e28, 0xbfffe4d4, 0x08726a78,
0x08795180) = 7471
