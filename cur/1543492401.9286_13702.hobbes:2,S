HEllo,
  I was reading the latest information about AMD's new K7 and there
use of Digitals CPU interface and I considered the following:
Take a dual CPU K7 motherboard and insert:
  - K7
  - 21264A Alpha.
Then run Linux on the Alpha Cpu and patch the em86 code to run
on the K7 treating it as a seperate device. 
Now I will admit I haven't gone looking through the kernel on this
issue yet but It seems to me as long as the Alpha is in the primary
CPU slot and You tell the kernel there is only one CPU it should boot
and run. Then You would have to create a driver for the second CPU.
In fact maybe VIA's bios could let you choose which CPU to make the primary one.
Then You could boot the 21264A when you need to do real work and boot the K7
to run the game launching OS. 
So what does anyone think?
