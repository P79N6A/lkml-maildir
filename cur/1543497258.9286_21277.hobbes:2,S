Sure, and who would have expected 4.2 billion IP addresses to be allocated
(note: allocated, not used). There are other advantages to having a large
uid/gid (IP, memory, etc, etc) space, many of which haven't even been
thought up yet.
The real question is whether or not it's worth it to slow down the 32-bit
processors with a 64-bit datatype. Are uid/gid used often enough that this
would cause a significant slowdown in the operation of the kernel? Are
64-bit processors so close on the horizon that they will be common enough
when 2.4 (3.0?) is finally released?
But there might be a way to compromise: Would it be possible to make
uid_t/gid_t implementation specific? As I read it, __kernel_time_t is an
unsigned long. If my memory serves (which is growing less and less likely
these days), this means that it is a 64-bit value on 64-bit architectures
and a 32-bit value on 32-bit architectures. This is the route that Sun
took with their 64-bit architectures with time_t, based on the (IMO
perfectly valid) assumption that in 38 years 32-bit binaries will be done
with.
So on 32-bit platforms you'd have:
32-bit uid_t
32-bit gid_t
32-bit time_t
etc, etc
and on 64-bit platforms you'd have:
64-bit uid_t
64-bit gid_t
64-bit time_t
etc, etc
If you want more than 4.2 billion users or you want to use your machine in
2039, get an alpha, ultra sparc, 64-bit PowerPC, or ia64. :-)
