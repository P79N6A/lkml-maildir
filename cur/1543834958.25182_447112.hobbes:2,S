And what if several skb->data are placed on the same page?
Or do we want to allocate at least one page for one skb? 
Even if it is an 40 bytes ack?

Btw, according to DMA allocations - there are some problems here too.
Some pieces of the world can not dma behind 16mb, and someone can do it
over 4gb. If only 16mb are used, it is just 8k packets with 1500 MTU,
and actually userspace does not know which NIC receives it's data, so it
is impossible in advance to allocate some pool, which will be used for
dma transfer, so we just need to allocate physical pages and use them
with memcpy() from skb->data.
Those physical pages can be managed within kernel and userspace can map
them. But there is another possibility - replace slab allocation for
network devices with allocation from premapped pool.
That naturally allows to manage that pool for AIO needs and have
zero-copy sending and receiving support. That is what I talked in
netchannel topic when question about allocation/freeing cost in atomic
context arised. I work on that solution, which can be used both for
netchannels (and full userspace processing) and usual networking code.
