that patch did fix the cpumask_t problem, however another one is present
  CC      arch/x86_64/kernel/mpparse.o
arch/x86_64/kernel/mpparse.c: In function `mp_parse_prt':
arch/x86_64/kernel/mpparse.c:899: error: too few arguments to function
`acpi_pci_link_get_irq'
make[1]: *** [arch/x86_64/kernel/mpparse.o] Error 1
make: *** [arch/x86_64/kernel] Error 2
While I was waiting for the cpumask_t fix, I tried to just comment out the
structure that caused the problem, it also got past the cpumask_t compile
error (however I didn't want to use a kernel with such a quick fix...).
When I did that I also stumbled on the mpparse problem and tried to fix
it. I don't know if it's a good fix but here's what I've done (I'd still
like some sort of patch since I'm not sure what are the exact effects):
I added stuff from the arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c file
in void __init mp_parse_prt (void) in  arch/x86_64/kernel/mpparse.c
I added the variables:
int edge_level
int active_high_low
modified the acpi_pci_link_get_ifq call to add the 2 variables at the end
and I also changed the else part of that if to reflect the one in the i386
mpparse.c file.
