Same here. In fact, I've always considered that procfs was for
humans while sysfs was for tools. sysfs reminds me too much the
unexploitable /devices in Solaris. With the proper tools, I think
we can do a lot with it, but it's not as intuitive to find the
proper tools as it was to do "ls" followed by "cat" in /proc.
