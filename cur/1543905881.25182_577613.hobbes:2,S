Subject: [PATCH 13/14] CacheFiles: A cache that backs onto a mounted filesystem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/31/473

Add an FS-Cache cache-backend that permits a mounted filesystem to be used as a
backing store for the cache.
CacheFiles uses a userspace daemon to do some of the cache management - such as
reaping stale nodes and culling.  This is called cachefilesd and lives in
/sbin.  The source for the daemon can be downloaded from:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/cachefs/cachefilesd.c
And an example configuration from:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/cachefs/cachefilesd.conf
The filesystem and data integrity of the cache are only as good as those of the
filesystem providing the backing services.  Note that CacheFiles does not
attempt to journal anything since the journalling interfaces of the various
filesystems are very specific in nature.
CacheFiles creates a proc-file - "/proc/fs/cachefiles" - that is used for
communication with the daemon.  Only one thing may have this open at once, and
whilst it is open, a cache is at least partially in existence.  The daemon
opens this and sends commands down it to control the cache.
CacheFiles is currently limited to a single cache.
CacheFiles attempts to maintain at least a certain percentage of free space on
the filesystem, shrinking the cache by culling the objects it contains to make
space if necessary - see the "Cache Culling" section.  This means it can be
placed on the same medium as a live set of data, and will expand to make use of
spare space and automatically contract when the set of data requires more
space.
============
REQUIREMENTS
============
The use of CacheFiles and its daemon requires the following features to be
available in the system and in the cache filesystem:
	- dnotify.
	- extended attributes (xattrs).
	- openat() and friends.
	- bmap() support on files in the filesystem (FIBMAP ioctl).
	- The use of bmap() to detect a partial page at the end of the file.
It is strongly recommended that the "dir_index" option is enabled on Ext3
filesystems being used as a cache.
=============
CONFIGURATION
=============
The cache is configured by a script in /etc/cachefilesd.conf.  These commands
set up cache ready for use.  The following script commands are available:
 (*) brun <N>%
 (*) bcull <N>%
 (*) bstop <N>%
	Configure the culling limits.  Optional.  See the section on culling
	The defaults are 7%, 5% and 1% respectively.
 (*) dir <path>
	Specify the directory containing the root of the cache.  Mandatory.
 (*) tag <name>
	Specify a tag to FS-Cache to use in distinguishing multiple caches.
	Optional.  The default is "CacheFiles".
 (*) debug <mask>
	Specify a numeric bitmask to control debugging in the kernel module.
	Optional.  The default is zero (all off).
==================
STARTING THE CACHE
==================
The cache is started by running the daemon.  The daemon opens the cache proc
file, configures the cache and tells it to begin caching.  At that point the
cache binds to fscache and the cache becomes live.
The daemon is run as follows:
	/sbin/cachefilesd [-d]* [-s] [-n] [-f <configfile>]
The flags are:
 (*) -d
	Increase the debugging level.  This can be specified multiple times and
	is cumulative with itself.
 (*) -s
	Send messages to stderr instead of syslog.
 (*) -n
	Don't daemonise and go into background.
 (*) -f <configfile>
	Use an alternative configuration file rather than the default one.
===============
THINGS TO AVOID
===============
Do not mount other things within the cache as this will cause problems.  The
kernel module contains its own very cut-down path walking facility that ignores
mountpoints, but the daemon can't avoid them.
Do not create, rename or unlink files and directories in the cache whilst the
cache is active, as this may cause the state to become uncertain.
Renaming files in the cache might make objects appear to be other objects (the
filename is part of the lookup key).
Do not change or remove the extended attributes attached to cache files by the
cache as this will cause the cache state management to get confused.
Do not create files or directories in the cache, lest the cache get confused or
serve incorrect data.
Do not chmod files in the cache.  The module creates things with minimal
permissions to prevent random users being able to access them directly.
=============
CACHE CULLING
=============
The cache may need culling occasionally to make space.  This involves
discarding objects from the cache that have been used less recently than
anything else.  Culling is based on the access time of data objects.  Empty
directories are culled if not in use.
Cache culling is done on the basis of the percentage of blocks available in the
underlying filesystem.  There are three "limits":
 (*) brun
     If the amount of available space in the cache rises above this limit, then
     culling is turned off.
 (*) bcull
     If the amount of available space in the cache falls below this limit, then
     culling is started.
 (*) bstop
     If the amount of available space in the cache falls below this limit, then
     no further allocation of disk space is permitted until culling has raised
     the amount above this limit again.
These must be configured thusly:
	0 <= bstop < bcull < brun < 100
Note that these are percentages of available space, and do _not_ appear as 100
minus the percentage displayed by the "df" program.
The userspace daemon scans the cache to build up a table of cullable objects.
These are then culled in least recently used order.  A new scan of the cache is
started as soon as space is made in the table.  Objects will be skipped if
their atimes have changed or if the kernel module says it is still using them.
===============
CACHE STRUCTURE
===============
The CacheFiles module will create two directories in the directory it was
given:
 (*) cache/
 (*) graveyard/
The active cache objects all reside in the first directory.  The CacheFiles
kernel module moves any retired or culled objects that it can't simply unlink
to the graveyard from which the daemon will actually delete them.
The daemon uses dnotify to monitor the graveyard directory, and will delete
anything that appears therein.
The module represents index objects as directories with the filename "I..." or
"J...".  Note that the "cache/" directory is itself a special index.
Data objects are represented as files if they have no children, or directories
if they do.  Their filenames all begin "D..." or "E...".  If represented as a
directory, data objects will have a file in the directory called "data" that
actually holds the data.
Special objects are similar to data objects, except their filenames begin
"S..." or "T...".
If an object has children, then it will be represented as a directory.
Immediately in the representative directory are a collection of directories
named for hash values of the child object keys with an '@' prepended.  Into
this directory, if possible, will be placed the representations of the child
objects:
	INDEX     INDEX      INDEX                             DATA FILES
	========= ========== ================================= ================
	cache/@4a/I03nfs/@30/Ji000000000000000--fHg8hi8400
	cache/@4a/I03nfs/@30/Ji000000000000000--fHg8hi8400/@75/Es0g000w...DB1ry
	cache/@4a/I03nfs/@30/Ji000000000000000--fHg8hi8400/@75/Es0g000w...N22ry
	cache/@4a/I03nfs/@30/Ji000000000000000--fHg8hi8400/@75/Es0g000w...FP1ry
If the key is so long that it exceeds NAME_MAX with the decorations added on to
it, then it will be cut into pieces, the first few of which will be used to
make a nest of directories, and the last one of which will be the objects
inside the last directory.  The names of the intermediate directories will have
'+' prepended:
	J1223/@23/+xy...z/+kl...m/Epqr
Note that keys are raw data, and not only may they exceed NAME_MAX in size,
they may also contain things like '/' and NUL characters, and so they may not
be suitable for turning directly into a filename.
To handle this, CacheFiles will use a suitably printable filename directly and
"base-64" encode ones that aren't directly suitable.  The two versions of
object filenames indicate the encoding:
	OBJECT TYPE	PRINTABLE	ENCODED
	===============	===============	===============
	Index		"I..."		"J..."
	Data		"D..."		"E..."
	Special		"S..."		"T..."
Intermediate directories are always "@" or "+" as appropriate.
Each object in the cache has an extended attribute label that holds the object
type ID (required to distinguish special objects) and the auxiliary data from
the netfs.  The latter is used to detect stale objects in the cache and update
or retire them.
Note that CacheFiles will erase from the cache any file it doesn't recognise or
any file of an incorrect type (such as a FIFO file or a device file).

+========
+OVERVIEW
+========
+
+CacheFiles is a caching backend that's meant to use as a cache a directory on
+an already mounted filesystem of a local type (such as Ext3).
+
+CacheFiles uses a userspace daemon to do some of the cache management - such as
+reaping stale nodes and culling.  This is called cachefilesd and lives in
+/sbin.
+
+The filesystem and data integrity of the cache are only as good as those of the
+filesystem providing the backing services.  Note that CacheFiles does not
+attempt to journal anything since the journalling interfaces of the various
+filesystems are very specific in nature.
+
+CacheFiles creates a misc character device - "/dev/cachefiles" - that is used
+to communication with the daemon.  Only one thing may have this open at once,
+and whilst it is open, a cache is at least partially in existence.  The daemon
+opens this and sends commands down it to control the cache.
+
+CacheFiles is currently limited to a single cache.
+
+CacheFiles attempts to maintain at least a certain percentage of free space on
+the filesystem, shrinking the cache by culling the objects it contains to make
+space if necessary - see the "Cache Culling" section.  This means it can be
+placed on the same medium as a live set of data, and will expand to make use of
+spare space and automatically contract when the set of data requires more
+space.
+
+
+============
+REQUIREMENTS
+============
+
+The use of CacheFiles and its daemon requires the following features to be
+available in the system and in the cache filesystem:
+
+	- dnotify.
+
+	- extended attributes (xattrs).
+
+	- openat() and friends.
+
+	- bmap() support on files in the filesystem (FIBMAP ioctl).
+
+	- The use of bmap() to detect a partial page at the end of the file.
+
+It is strongly recommended that the "dir_index" option is enabled on Ext3
+filesystems being used as a cache.
+
+
+=============
+CONFIGURATION
+=============
+
+The cache is configured by a script in /etc/cachefilesd.conf.  These commands
+set up cache ready for use.  The following script commands are available:
+
+ (*) brun <N>%
+ (*) bcull <N>%
+ (*) bstop <N>%
+ (*) frun <N>%
+ (*) fcull <N>%
+ (*) fstop <N>%
+
+	Configure the culling limits.  Optional.  See the section on culling
+	The defaults are 7% (run), 5% (cull) and 1% (stop) respectively.
+
+	The commands beginning with a 'b' are file space (block) limits, those
+	beginning with an 'f' are file count limits.
+
+ (*) dir <path>
+
+	Specify the directory containing the root of the cache.  Mandatory.
+
+ (*) tag <name>
+
+	Specify a tag to FS-Cache to use in distinguishing multiple caches.
+	Optional.  The default is "CacheFiles".
+
+ (*) debug <mask>
+
+	Specify a numeric bitmask to control debugging in the kernel module.
+	Optional.  The default is zero (all off).  The following values can be
+	OR'd into the mask to collect various information:
+
+		1	Turn on trace of function entry (_enter() macros)
+		2	Turn on trace of function exit (_leave() macros)
+		4	Turn on trace of internal debug points (_debug())
+
+	This mask can also be set through sysfs, eg:
+
+		echo 5 >/sys/modules/cachefiles/parameters/debug
+

+
+=============
+CACHE CULLING
+=============
+
+The cache may need culling occasionally to make space.  This involves
+discarding objects from the cache that have been used less recently than
+anything else.  Culling is based on the access time of data objects.  Empty
+directories are culled if not in use.
+
+Cache culling is done on the basis of the percentage of blocks and the
+percentage of files available in the underlying filesystem.  There are six
+"limits":
+
+ (*) brun
+ (*) frun
+
+     If the amount of free space and the number of available files in the cache
+     rises above both these limits, then culling is turned off.
+
+ (*) bcull
+ (*) fcull
+
+     If the amount of available space or the number of available files in the
+     cache falls below either of these limits, then culling is started.
+
+ (*) bstop
+ (*) fstop
+
+     If the amount of available space or the number of available files in the
+     cache falls below either of these limits, then no further allocation of
+     disk space or files is permitted until culling has raised things above
+     these limits again.
+
+These must be configured thusly:
+
+	0 <= bstop < bcull < brun < 100
+	0 <= fstop < fcull < frun < 100
+
+Note that these are percentages of available space and available files, and do
+_not_ appear as 100 minus the percentage displayed by the "df" program.
+
+The userspace daemon scans the cache to build up a table of cullable objects.
+These are then culled in least recently used order.  A new scan of the cache is
+started as soon as space is made in the table.  Objects will be skipped if
+their atimes have changed or if the kernel module says it is still using them.

+any file of an incorrect type (such as a FIFO file or a device file).
+
+
+==========================
+SECURITY MODEL AND SELINUX
+==========================
+
+CacheFiles is implemented to deal properly with the LSM security features of
+the Linux kernel and the SELinux facility.
+
+One of the problems that CacheFiles faces is that it is generally acting on
+behalf of a process, and running in that process's context, and that includes a
+security context that is not appropriate for accessing the cache - either
+because the files in the cache are inaccessible to that process, or because if
+the process creates a file in the cache, that file may be inaccessible to other
+processes.
+
+The way CacheFiles works is to temporarily change the security context (fsuid,
+fsgid and actor security label) that the process acts as - without changing the
+security context of the process when it the target of an operation performed by
+some other process (so signalling and suchlike still work correctly).
+
+
+When the CacheFiles module is asked to bind to its cache, it:
+
+ (1) Finds the security label attached to the root cache directory and uses
+     that as the security label with which it will create files.  By default,
+     this is:
+
+	cachefiles_var_t
+
+ (2) Finds the security label of the process which issued the bind request
+     (presumed to be the cachefilesd daemon), which by default will be:
+
+	cachefilesd_t
+
+     and asks LSM to supply a security ID as which it should act given the
+     daemon's label.  By default, this will be:
+
+	cachefiles_kernel_t
+
+     SELinux transitions the daemon's security ID to the module's security ID
+     based on a rule of this form in the policy.
+
+	type_transition <daemon's-ID> kernel_t : process <module's-ID>;
+
+     For instance:
+
+	type_transition cachefilesd_t kernel_t : process cachefiles_kernel_t;
+
+
+The module's security ID gives it permission to create, move and remove files
+and directories in the cache, to find and access directories and files in the
+cache, to set and access extended attributes on cache objects, and to read and
+write files in the cache.
+
+The daemon's security ID gives it only a very restricted set of permissions: it
+may scan directories, stat files and erase files and directories.  It may
+not read or write files in the cache, and so it is precluded from accessing the
+data cached therein; nor is it permitted to create new files in the cache.
+
+
+There are policy source files available in:
+
+	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/fscache/cachefilesd-0.8.tar.bz2
+
+and later versions.  In that tarball, see the files:
+
+	cachefilesd.te
+	cachefilesd.fc
+	cachefilesd.if
+
+They are built and installed directly by the RPM.
+
+If a non-RPM based system is being used, then copy the above files to their own
+directory and run:
+
+	make -f /usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile
+	semodule -i cachefilesd.pp
+
+You will need checkpolicy and selinux-policy-devel installed prior to the
+build.
+
+
+By default, the cache is located in /var/fscache, but if it is desirable that
+it should be elsewhere, than either the above policy files must be altered, or
+an auxiliary policy must be installed to label the alternate location of the
+cache.
+
+For instructions on how to add an auxiliary policy to enable the cache to be
+located elsewhere when SELinux is in enforcing mode, please see:
+
+	/usr/share/doc/cachefilesd-*/move-cache.txt
+
+When the cachefilesd rpm is installed; alternatively, the document can be found
+in the sources.

+	  filesystems - primarily networking filesystems - thus allowing fast
+	  local disk to enhance the speed of slower devices.
+
+	  See Documentation/filesystems/caching/cachefiles.txt for more
+	  information.
+
+config CACHEFILES_DEBUG
+	bool "Debug CacheFiles"
+	depends on CACHEFILES
+	help
+	  This permits debugging to be dynamically enabled in the filesystem
+	  caching on files module.  If this is set, the debugging output may be
+	  enabled by setting bits in /sys/modules/cachefiles/parameter/debug or
+	  by including a debugging specifier in /etc/cachefilesd.conf.
+
+config CACHEFILES_HISTOGRAM
+	bool "Gather latency information on CacheFiles"
+	depends on CACHEFILES && FSCACHE_PROC
+	help
+
+	  This option causes latency information to be gathered on CacheFiles
+	  operation and exported through file:
+
+		/proc/fs/fscache/cachefiles/histogram
+
+	  See Documentation/filesystems/caching/cachefiles.txt for more
+	  information.
