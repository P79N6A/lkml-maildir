I'm beginning to believe it may be BIOS revision related.  I haven't
tried the Promise controller since I don't have an ATA-100 drive, but I
don't seem to have any of the data corruption or other problems that
people have mentioned.  I guess I'll hold off updating the BIOS for now
though.  I bought the motherboard not two weeks ago, together with a
Athlon 900MHz processor and it has BIOS version 1004D.  I have seen
problems even with Windows using the 1005D version though.  My shop has
been selling a LOT of this board; the problems we've seen come back seem
to be specifically related to 1005D.  Reflashing to 1004D has cured any
problems I've seen.  I've not seen any new hardware come through from
the factory with 1006 though.
