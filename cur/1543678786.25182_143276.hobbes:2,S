Found the cam, downloaded any old pics, recompiled with taskfile I/O and
- nothing. 2.5.73 + your second IDE patch do work flawlessly on my old
box. The "clack     clack    clack" went away is if had never been
there...
So - thanks a lot for looking at my problem. Please feed your patch to
Linus as it seems to actually solve (at least my) problems.
However, allow me to ask why this occured never bevore (for other
people)? Do they all have only one drive? Does nobody use TCQ? Nobody
with old hardware (though, your patch hasn't touched the core PIIX
parts...)?
MfG, JBG
