MMU OFF, access to entire physical memory. This will not work on
things like pSeries with hypervisor or iSeries, but I could deal with
that if/when needed. I know that x86 with more than 4Gb cannot access
the entire RAM in a linear way though, dunno what other facilities
you have outside of kmap then. But leave the door open to archs that
can do it ;)
