Trond, I've been looking at this a bit more. I've tried 2.4.18 and
2.2.21 and nothing changes - it always looks bad. If I look at top
output for
    time dd if=/dev/zero of=TESTFILE count=3000 bs=100k
rpciod is around 60% of CPU and there is 0% idle. A typical vmstat line
is:
  procs                      memory    swap          io     system cpu
r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache  si  so    bi    bo   in    cs us  sy  id 
1  0  0      0  16228      4 197316   0   0     0     0 1426   603 14  86   0
Now, I contrast this to the other box (same CPU speed, other mobo):
  procs                      memory    swap          io     system cpu
r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache  si  so    bi    bo   in    cs us  sy  id 
0  1  0      0 196216      0  53656   0   0     0     0  103     9   0 0 100
I see rpciod running, but very rarely. So any idea why rpciod would be
running and burning up CPU a lot in the first case, but not in the
second? Maybe I need a kernel profiler to go after the actual problem?
Take care,
