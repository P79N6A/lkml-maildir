from site above;
Comparison between htop and top
      * In 'htop' you can scroll the list vertically and horizontally to
        see all processes and complete command lines.
      * In 'top' you are subject to a delay for each unassigned key you
        press (especially annoying when multi-key escape sequences are
        triggered by accident).
      * 'htop' starts faster ('top' seems to collect data for a while
        before displaying anything).
      * In 'htop' you don't need to type the process number to kill a
        process, in 'top' you do.
      * In 'htop' you don't need to type the process number or the
        priority value to renice a process, in 'top' you do.
      * 'htop' supports mouse operation, 'top' doesn't
      * 'top' is older, hence, more used and tested.
cheers!
