Bah, never mind.  Major issue between the keyboard and the chair, on my
end...  Got PR# and PS# confused.  The ThinkPad ACPI DSDT in question has
the standard crap for wake device control, and PR# methods, but no PS#
methods.
The PR0..PR2 nodes for the UHCI and EHCI USB ports on the ThinkPad T43
mention a power resource object, and that power resource CAN power on/off
the USB ports (and that freaks out the UHCI and EHCI kernel drivers causing
over-current reports, but that was to be expected).  The AML code tells the
EC to do some magic that probably tells a MOSFET somewhere in the mainboard
to stop supplying power to the ports.
And Windows XP (this is not a Vista BIOS and I never tried running Vista in
it...) is noticing that power resource (even without PS3 or PR3 nodes) and
calling that power resource _OFF handler to power down USB ports when it
doesn't need these devices for wakeup reasons, before entering STR.
Anyone has any clue on what part of the ACPI spec could result on that
behaviour?  Because otherwise I will just bloody special-case it into
thinkpad-acpi's suspend and resume stuff.  It will piss the USB subsystem
off if I can't arrange to do it on early resume and late suspend, however.
