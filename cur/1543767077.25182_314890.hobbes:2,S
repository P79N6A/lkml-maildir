It started from a desire to extend the existing implementations to
support new features such as asynchronous notification. Currently that
sort of thing is impossible unless your developer-super-powers include
the ability to herd 24 different subsystem maintainers into working
together on a solution.
In other words, the main drive is the desire to make it maintainable.
