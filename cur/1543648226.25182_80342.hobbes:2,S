there are four things that really suck about sigio.
in order of most-significant-suckage to least-significant-suckage, i see 
them as:
  [1] signals are very heavy.
      thousands of signals/second does not scale on SMP due to the
      serialization of them in the kernel.
      (just look at the code path for delivering a signal)
      signals also resulted in 128 u32's being transferred from kernel
      to userspace for every signal.  thats a lot of memory i/o
      bandwidth consumed at 1000's of concurrent sockets
      and tens-of-thousands of events/sec happening.
  [2] SIGIO only exposes half of the POLL_OUT semantics.
      with poll(), you can use POLL_OUT to indicate if there
      is free buffer space to write into or not.
      with SIGIO, for most applications, you can only find out
      by issuing a write() and get back a -EWOULDBLOCK.
      to indicate !POLL_OUT.
      (perhaps that has been addressed in the last 12 months or so;
      but i doubt it)
  [3] SIGIO had no easy recovery path if you hit the maximum-
      queue-limit for number of signals queued to userspace.
      (ok, you *could* do a poll() and start again, but it couldn't
      be done in a 100% race-free manner)
  [4] you couldn't enable SIGIO on a incoming socket
      accept()ed without there being a race window where
      something happened to that socket between accept() and
      enable-SIGIO.  [sort-of related to (3); you could work-around
      it by doing a poll() on the socket after enable-SIGIO, but
      it makes a clean interface a horrible interface]
other miscellaneous things that makes SIGIO less usable in the real-world:
  - you can only get one event at a time -- that means tens-of-thousands
    to hundreds-of-thousands of system calls / second just to get event
    status, when it'd probably make more sense to poll for multiple signals
    at the same time
  - SIGIO only addressed "event notification".  it did nothing to address the
    other large scalability that you typically hit when writing 
high-performance i/o
    systems: overhead of memory-copy from userspace<->kernelspace.
    various zerocopy mechanisms help address that side of thing, but if you're
    comparing aio to SIGIO, aio *is* addressing a much larger problem than just
    SIGIO on its own
