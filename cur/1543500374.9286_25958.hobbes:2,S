?? BPF is pretty dumb system copying data twice. The first is copy to buffer
(Linux has not this stage at all), the second is equivalent to Linux way.

I do not remember a case, when threads helped to get CPU ticks magically.
It really helps to reduce latency a bit by using blocking io instead of
poll/read, but it is inessential when doing bulk work. NFR spends
lots of time analyzing packets, copies lots of useless data,
system overhead is negligible.

Seems, their main problem is brainlessness, unfortunately 8)
