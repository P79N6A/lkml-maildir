Do you know if they ever fixed this same issue in Microsoft Access? :-) Does
Linux support tape drives? :-)
Sure, Linux needs to be able to handle files > 2 GB, but I wonder if backups
over a network to a hard drive are giving you a false sense of "security".
In the "enterprise" world, you have to be *religious* about backups.
Incrementals at least daily, fulls at least weekly, all backups verified and
*off-site secure storage of backup media*. Dang! The soap company wants
their &$^%&$# box back :-).
