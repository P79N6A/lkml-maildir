Oh!
And, looking at the docs on those modules, I see nice big warnings that
say something similar...
Looking further, these modules where build and installed by default
when I installed my system (debian, with the 2.4.18-bf2.4 kernel), and
I've been carrying forward that configuration on my hand-built kernels,
and never realized I needed to get rid of those modules.
I see the hid-debug messages in syslog now, but the keyboard and mouse
are working properly as well.  Do you want to pursue this any further?
[If so, I can send you the messages.]
[It's perhaps of note that the extra keys on the keyboard are reported
as scancode 0 by showkey (with other release scan codes) when plugged
in via usb and which have different keypress scan codss when plugged as
a ps/2 keyboard.]
[[There's a slight chance that [to avoid confused messages from other
people in my situation] a warning message from hid about usbkbd and
usbmouse would be a good idea.]]
Thank you very much.
Sorry about the confusion,
