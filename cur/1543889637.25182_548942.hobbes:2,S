hm.  I don't see why that race window would be a problem in practice: the
page-exciser does a lock_page();wait_on_page_writeback() as normal, then
proceeds with its business?
But given that this doesn't work right for some reason, can we use PG_error
and then handle that appropriately in the filesystem's ->prepare_write() and
->page_mkwrite()?

Well, using PG_error is OK and appropriate for that if it's localised to
the fs.  But I'd be a bit worried about requiring that the VFS maintain
some special protocol for it, partly because it would be such a
rarely-tested thing.
