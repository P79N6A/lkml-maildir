Two questions:
  Are you running statd on the client and server?
if no, then you should...
  Does SuSE compile statd with or without the RESTRICTED_STATD flag?
If the latter, then you'll need an extra kernel patch in order to
allow the kernel NSM to use a reserved port. Something like the
appended scheme...
Cheers,
