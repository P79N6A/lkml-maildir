Yep - this looks promising. No soft lockups for last half an hour 
with 4-5 Wakeups from idle. It is almost smooth - jerkiness gone down by 
99%. There are still very infrequent and quick spells where the key typed 
on the keyboard takes effect a little later - but nothing like earlier.
I will run it for a little longer just to be sure - but I don't think it 
will be a problem.
Thanks Thomas.
