Urgh. That assumes either
	a) recursion in ext2_get_block() or
	b) ext2_get_block() called from interrupt context.
The latter is obviously deadly, but I don't see such callers appearing
lately.
The former... WTF? I might believe it if the trace would go through
buffer.c, but it seems to stay in ext2/inode.c...
It almost looks like gcc turned loop into tail recursion, but it shouldn't
be doing it, should it? Just in case, could you send me fs/ext2/inode.o
and version of your gcc?
Aside of these 3 variants I see no other possible cause for such trace.
Linus, do you see any other possible reason for trace of that kind?
