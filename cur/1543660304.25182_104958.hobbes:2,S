Subject: [PATCH] ext2 allocation failures
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

For almost a year (since 2.5.4) ext2_new_block has tended to set err
0 instead of -ENOSPC or -EIO.  This manifested variously (typically
depends on what's stale in ext2_get_block's chain[4] array): sometimes
__brelse free free buffer backtraces, sometimes release_pages oops,
usually generic_make_request beyond end of device messages, followed
by further ext2 errors.
[Insert lecture on dangers of using goto for unwind :-]
