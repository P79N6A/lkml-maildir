Okay, here's the latest draft.  There are some substantial revisions regarding the UNIX problem, which I think Albert Cahalan has
solved for us.  I also trimmed the URLs quite a bit, so I'm sorry if I took out something you might consider important, but it had to
be done.  (The survey results were QUITE clear on that point.)
Incidentally, the FSF/GNU reference stays, by popular demand.  Same with the SAMBA reference, as I suspected.  Y2K is another story,
with most people wanting to move to "background."  If anyone has a suggestion for moving it to the background section, please send me
a diff relative to draft final-6.  (Things have changed quite a bit since final-5.)
As before, you can get the latest version off the web at

Thanks,

**** DRAFT **** PRESS RELEASE - LINUX KERNEL 2.2.0 **** DRAFT ****
**** FORK 1 **** FINAL-6 DRAFT
Linux kernel version 2.2.0 released
FOR RELEASE: Tuesday 26 January 1999
Contact: linux-2.2@linuxunited.org
SANTA CLARA, C.A. -- Today Linus Torvalds, the primary developer and
coordinator of the Linux kernel team, releases a major new version of the
Linux kernel.  This update brings substantial performance improvements and
a multitude of new features.
* Advanced network routing and wide area network (WAN) support give Linux
  the ability to replace many expensive, proprietary network devices.
  Users can take control of their intranets with support for usage limits,
  accounting, firewalls, and virtual private networks.
* Strong 256-bit encryption, uncompromised by US export restrictions, is
  available as an add-on component. It protects both network
  infrastructure and hard disk storage, including swap space.
* Owing to its tradition of open and international development, Linux is
  an operating system ready for the new millennium.  Linux 2.2 remains
  Y2K-ready, and continues to build on previous versions'
  internationalization support.
* Enterprise-level network filesystem support, with data replication for
  performance, mobility, and extreme reliability, ensures that file
  server destruction does not stop business.
* New multimedia capabilities in Linux 2.2 include video capture support,
  TV tuner support, and enhanced audio support.
* A wide variety of new SCSI and parallel-port devices are now supported,
  including disk drives, tape drives, and other external devices.
* Already legendary performance is significantly enhanced.  High-end
  symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support scales well, supporting systems
  with up to 64 processors.
* Compatibility with Windows NT and BSD filesystems enables Linux 2.2 to
  seamlessly handle data from legacy systems.  With SAMBA, a Linux system
  can transparently replace all NT Server functions, including file- and
  print-sharing and domain authentication.
* Because Linux operates under an open development model, every user can
  modify the operating system components, and submit improvements for the
  official distribution. This eases the development of new features, and
  lets users repair problems immediately as they are discovered.
Linux 2.2 is available for free download via the Internet.  For a list of
the "mirror servers" established in anticipation of the massive demand for
this new release, visit the Linux Kernel Archive (
http://www.kernel.org/
).
As always, the Linux kernel is distributed as Free Software under the terms
of the GNU General Public License (
http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html
).
Linux distribution vendors are expected to ship fully-integrated systems
using the new kernel before Q2 1999.  Business users should look to their
distribution vendors for information about this important upgrade.
ABOUT LINUX
"Linux" is the common name for a class of secure network operating systems
based on the Linux kernel and other open source software including the Free
Software Foundation's GNU Project, the Apache web server, Samba, the X
Window System, and portions of BSD.  Linux takes full advantage of modern,
high-end x86, Power Mac, Alpha, and UltraSPARC hardware.  It can also
breathe life into older machines -- even 386- and 486-based computers.
Networks of Linux computers can provide supercomputer-like performance for
some applications; one widely-known example is the dramatic 3-D scenes in
the blockbuster movie "Titanic", which were rendered on Alpha-powered Linux
systems.
Both traditional support contracts and cost-effective Internet support
resources are readily available.  Linux is provided under an unlimited-use
license that lets users make in-house customizations to the system itself.
Recent estimates suggest that Linux has up to 20 million users worldwide.
Microsoft employees Josh Cohen and Vinod Valloppillil, in a competitive
examination of Linux (The so-called "Halloween Document",
http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html
), wrote that "Linux. . .is trusted
on mission critical applications, and - due to its open source code - has a
long term credibility which exceeds many other competitive operating
systems."
ABOUT LINUS TORVALDS
Linus Torvalds, originally from Finland, lives with his family in Santa
Clara, CA, USA.  He and others created Linux as an open-source alternative
to proprietary, closed operating systems after becoming disillusioned with
the poor quality and prohibitive pricing of commercial offerings.
Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds.  Power Mac is a
trademark of Apple Computer, Inc.  UltraSPARC is a trademark of Sun
Microsystems, Inc.  Alpha is a trademark of Compaq Computer Corporation.
The X Window System is a trademark of The Open Group.  Microsoft and
