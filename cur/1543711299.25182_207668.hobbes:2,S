Right, we want local memory (or potentially remote memory) for DMA,
but what about interrupt redirection?  Some chipsets don't support
interrupt round robin, and just target interrupts at one CPU.  In that
case (and probably the round robin case too), you want to know which
CPU(s) to send the interrupt at.  Can't immediately think of other
in-kernel uses though (administrators will of course want to be able
to locate a given PCI device in a multirack system, but that's another
subject--one that Martin Hicks posted on yesterday).
