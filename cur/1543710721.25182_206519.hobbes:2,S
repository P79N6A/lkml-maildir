I've used the libata driver for it (makes it appear as a SCSI device)
and it's worked fine for me but I've stopped using it after finding
out about trouble with that controller. If you have a second sata
controller on board, like a promise for instance, use that instead.
You still need libata in that case though.
Trouble with the controller is that three motherboards from three
manufacturers have eaten* three harddrives for me.
There are numerous threads on the net about people experiencing
similar effects as I did ..
