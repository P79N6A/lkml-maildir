The Coverity checker spotted the following inconsequent NULL checking in 
drivers/char/pcmcia/ipwireless/network.c:
<--  snip  -->
void ipwireless_network_packet_received(struct ipw_network *network,
                                        unsigned int channel_idx,
                                        unsigned char *data,
                                        unsigned int length)
{
...
                /*
                 * If it's associated with a tty (other than the RAS channel
                 * when we're online), then send the data to that tty. The RAS
                 * channel's data is handled above - it always goes through
                 * ppp_generic.
                 */
                if (tty && channel_idx == IPW_CHANNEL_RAS
                                && (network->ras_control_lines &
                                        IPW_CONTROL_LINE_DCD) != 0
                                && ipwireless_tty_is_modem(tty)) {
...
                /* Otherwise we send it out the tty. */
                else
                        ipwireless_tty_received(tty, data, length);
...
<--  snip  -->
ipwireless_tty_received() dereferences "tty".

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
