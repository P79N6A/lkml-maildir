Looks so.

Good question...

Yeah, will try. Plus libraries...

Meanwhile, I've written a micro-program with an assembly-inline with cmov.
I have no idea about the ix86 assembly, so, I've just done
int main(void)
{
	int x=0,y=1;
	__asm__(
	"testl	%0, %0\n"
"	cmovnz	%0, %1":"=r" (x) :"r" (y));
	exit(x);
}
On "10" the exit code is 1, which is correct (?), on "8" the exit code is
76. Funny enough, strace on "8" produces also
semget(2, 1074927648, 0)                = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
but this, most probably, comes from the new libc6, that I installed there.
