But if we think of the shm fs as an in memory fs we could mount an
instance somewhere simply to get the directory handling for Unix
Domain sockets. The Unix domain sockets then only needed the path to
their instance to put in front of the sun_path like SYSV shm needs it
right now.
For this we would need to decouple the shm fs from SYSV shm and also
add features like multiple mounts, directories and special files.
But I think it's worth a thought.
