Attached is a link to information I found about Delta Debugging:
"The Delta Debugging project at Software Engineering Chair, Saarland
University investigates a new automated debugging approach based on
systematic testing. With Delta Debugging, we can find failure-inducing
circumstances automatically - circumstances such as the program input,
changes to the program code, executed statements, or thread schedules."
