Actually, I was referring to the problem of potentially including "out of domain" CPUs in the search, but that is a good point too.  Ill have to think about whether a get/put is needed here.

Thats exactly right.  rd->online is a cached version of "rd->span & cpu_online_map".  It simply saves us from having to do an extra cpu_and() at run-time (which can be expensive as the NR_CPUS grows large).

See above: I'm not sure, but you may be right about that.
