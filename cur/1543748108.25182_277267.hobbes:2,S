i have released the -V0.7.32-4 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from the usual place:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this is a fixes-only release.
Changes since -V0.7.32-2:
 - fixed a seqlock related xtime_lock lockup scenario - this could 
   explain the SMP lockups reported by Mark H. Johnson.
 - fixed a small buglet in the new SMP RT-balancing code, which could 
   lead to bad balancing in certain rare cases.
to create a -V0.7.32-4 tree from scratch, the patching order is:
