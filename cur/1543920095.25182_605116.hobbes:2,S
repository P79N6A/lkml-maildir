It's a corner case of some sort, as DM uses ioctl numbers differently
from most subsystems by splitting to code from the size argument
during processing. Your change is certainly not an _incompatible_
change to the ABI, but 32 bit binaries compiled against the new
headers will use different ioctl numbers from those built against
older headers.
This may break other code that expects a specific number, even
if your handler does not care. The old compat code handles both
variants (no variable size arguments), but /usr/bin/strace may have
encoded only one set of numbers AFAICT.

Ok, sounds good. I don't think it's the kind of patch that should go
into stable backports though.
