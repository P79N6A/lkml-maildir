I know.  Then again, if grub can read ext2... :)
Better would be the initramfs stuff, though.  If there's a way to trigger a 
resume that kills all running processes and loads userspace from the swap 
partition, then you could do that from initramfs _after_ finding /root a 
checking fstab, life is good.  (of course ext3 is brain-dead enough to always 
replay the journal even if it mounts read-only, so you'd have to mount it 
ext2 or something...  Hmmm...)

This was _right_ after the system booted up.  Possibly hotplug was still 
finding stuff, or the pcmcia wireless card had just decided it had found its 
access point, or some such...
These kinds of asynchronous module loads and unloads do happen.  The orinoco 
card driver is broken enough to sometimes decide that when it loses 
connection with the access point, instead of toggling the link status it 
decides the card has been unplugged!  (Real pain when that happens, by the 
way...)
So I can imagine modprobe was running, yeah.  But I hadn't done it personally.
