Ah, ok. So the culprit is gnome-pilot listening for HotSync events. 
I thought that as soon as the unit/usb device is disconnected, also the
device numbers are released.
But then: How to cope with problems like this? REcurring plugging and
unplugging and a program listening to this?
Is it possible to have
	/dev/pilot	->	/dev/ttyUSB1
and gnome-pilot opens /dev/pilot. Will then every new hot sync also
create other devices?
Best wishes
Norbert
