I think that most of the logic testing exit_signal was written when
CLONE_DETACHED could be used independent of CLONE_THREAD.  We concluded
that was unworkable due to some related races and changed clone so that the
situation of a (live) thread group leader with exit_signal == -1 is now
impossible.
