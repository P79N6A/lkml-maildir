Responding to an old post here.
I have only recently integrated Ram's patches except for the kbuild
integration bits. On top of this Andreas' license compatibility thing so
in effect:
building a GPL module (or compatible) => no change
building a GPL-incompatible module =>
                           warn if module uses EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL_FUTURE
                           error out if module uses EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
Patches are in kbuild.git.
The script to show module export statistics is not yet merged, I've
asked Ram to fix a few things first.
