I vaguely remember being pretty well up to speed on V2 (circa... 1995?)  The 
last one I even glanced at was V3, but I never had to support it.  I haven't 
even looked at V4.  For exporting /home directories, everybody I deal with 
seems to want samba servers these days instead for some reason.  (Couple of 
net boot systems that care more about permissions than that, but ram's so 
cheap that it's easier to just "ssh user@bootserver -i key "cat root_img.tgz" 
| tar xz" into a ramfs or shmfs or some such.  (Heck, the last system I set 
up like that mounted a zisofs image and ran from that...)
I'm sure it's still useful.  I just haven't wanted to even attempt to secure 
it.  For home directories, samba is doing a simple tcp/ip connection per 
session, reestablishing it automatically if it breaks (same server reboot 
question).  Since _both_ protocols seem to suck pretty badly under the hood, 
it's been a question of choosing the lesser of two evils.  It seems that more 
people actually USE samba, so...

I don't like nfs, I haven't bothered to actually use it for anything since 
1999, so no.

I can transparently tunnel any tcp/ip session through ssh with some iptables 
rules and a dozen line python script.  (Great fun for rolling your own vpn.)  
Mixing UDP and encryption is just plain a bad idea: no level at which it 
makes sense to store persistent connection state in a "fire and forget" 
packet protocol...)
I.E. this also works with samba, but didn't with (old) NFS.

Can you recommend a good link to the history of NFS?  Computer history's a 
hobby of mine.  (I've got snippets on this topic, but not any kind of unified 
story of NFS...)
