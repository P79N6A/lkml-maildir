Hm. I was going to agree with you, but then I thought a bit more:
% ls -lF /usr/bin/lpq
-rwsr-xr-x   1 root     root        83894 Apr 1  1999 /usr/bin/lpq*
% capshow /usr/bin/lpq
Grant: CAP_EUID, CAP_PRIV_SOCK
Deny:  CAP_SOMETHING
Euid:  20 (lp)
[...]
So, in other words, you have a capability that says "look in the
header for a UID and switch euid to that". So Albert can still have
his full compatibility with tar, uucp, cp, ar, NFS, isofs and
everything else.
Problems?
