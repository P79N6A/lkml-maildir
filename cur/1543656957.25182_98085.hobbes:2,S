I see, thanks. I always had an impression that pci_init is called
way too late in the boot sequence, at least on the PCI-centric systems.
This makes all that PCI surgery really painful. Ideally, the init
order should be defined per architecture. This applies to the
generic device model as well: currently we have legacy, isa-pnp
and other stuff initialized and probed *before* PCI, though typically
these are hanging of the PCI bus. And it's a real problem on machines
with multiple PCI buses. Oh, well...

It can be trivially done using Linus' idea of probing in 2 phases.
The pass 1 can be made 100% non-destructive: we can initialize
device structures, read in device/vendor IDs, class codes and
build the bus trees. Basically, everything that we do currently
minus pci_read_bases(), so the resource fields are blank. Then we
can call arch- and device-specific routines, where along with other
fixups the device BARs could be probed in arch-specific way and written
down in the pci_dev structure.
In the pass 2 (generic BAR probing), we can check the resource flags
for non-zero value and skip the probe of respective BAR.
This would make the code a LOT more flexible.
Ivan.
