<checking> yeah... Frankly, I'd just do

- obviously correct, avoids disk waste and since we do it in __block...
everything keeps working (block_... versions are obviously OK, cont_...
also does the right thing).
Dunno. I like the idea of expanding truncate() being the same as
lseek() + empty write(). After all, that's what it is.
Comments?
