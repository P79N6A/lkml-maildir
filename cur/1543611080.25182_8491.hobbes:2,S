That's easily done, and we know that load average
is a measure of tasks waiting to run - but rather
than throw more statistics around, I can say that
a Linux desktop running tux remains responsive
under a http load that would tend to monopolize it's
attention under apache -
Now I'm not knocking apache of course, it's the
standard these days, and there's nothing more
flexible or reliable - but there is indeed a niche
for a small, blindingly fast server like tux - and I
intend to explore that niche in coming months.
