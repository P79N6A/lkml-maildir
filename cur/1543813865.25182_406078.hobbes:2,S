Any comments on this:
http://www.denx.de/wiki/Know/Linux24vs26
On another denx.de page I found this summary (so you do not have to
visit the page):
# slow to build: 2.6 takes 30...40% longer to compile
# Big memory footprint in flash: the 2.6 compressed kernel image is
# 30...40% bigger
# Big memory footprint in RAM: the 2.6 kernel needs 30...40% more RAM;
# the available RAM size for applications is 700kB smaller
# Slow to boot: 2.6 takes 5...15% longer to boot into multi-user mode
# Slow to run: context switches up to 96% slower, local communication
# latencies up to 80% slower, file system latencies up to 76% slower,
# local communication bandwidth less than 50% in some cases.
I'm merely asked because I have been pointed to this page several times
and I do nto have numbers for 2.4 versus 2.6.
Note: denx does support 2.6 now.
I do not concur and recommend 2.6 but wanted to know if anyone had more
insight to share.
