What are the device/revision id's of the pci irq router function?

This sounds different wrt. what we have documented for the older 85C503 
ISA bridge which is used in the 5595 chipset family.

0x61=IDEIRQ / 0x62=USBIRQ is definitely correct for the 5595/85C503 rev 01 
- according to the data sheet and playing with setpci ;-)

Looks like your chipset uses a different irq routing register layout. When 
the existing sis pci-irq routing stuff was added, the primary concern was 
to handle the ambigous link values (0x40-43 vs. 0x00-03) used by different 
BIOS's. The IDEIRQ case was merely added for documentation, it's unused.
I think this might need some special treatment in pirq_sis_[sg]et(), 
either checking for the revision id or a different pci device id.
Btw, have you tried with acpi interrupt routing enabled?
