  Change the remaining two instances of "kcalloc(1,...)" to
"kzalloc()".

  Now that that general change has been merged into Linus' tree, I've
added a check for that to an ongoing "coding style" script of mine
that scans the tree on a regular basis to detect stuff that shouldn't
be there anymore.  Having subjected everyone to the unspeakable grief
of getting that patch in in the first place, I'm going to make sure
stuff like that never comes back.
  As Barney Fife would say, "Nip it!  Nip it in the bud!"
