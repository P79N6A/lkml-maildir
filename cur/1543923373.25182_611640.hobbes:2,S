I may have been stating things a bit to strong when talking only about
"formal" models only. But possibly you could just define the non-formal
experimental models as a single group.
The thing I was trying to propose was aimed at the problem that if someone
proposes a patch to the LSM base code that he/she feels is needed to
complete an LSM module that implements a particular (formal) model,
he/she would end up explaining and/or defending both the 'model', the module
and its requirement for the patch.
What I tried to propose is to assign some sort of maintainer role for each
(formal) model, and let these roles take care of the module/patch part of
stuff, while the module writer would only need to defend/discuss the the
patch with the model maintainer.

I would think the two may benefit from a role as described above.
But I was thinking more in the line of new modules that may again
implement this same model, and would thus benefit from interaction with
this 'model maintainer' role.
