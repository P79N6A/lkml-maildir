Speaking of which .. I just read an announcement that someone (of course
the name eludes me) announced a DVD Burner that's SATA.
Found it:
http://www.plextor.com/english/news/press/712SA_pr.htm
a) Are there provisions in the SATA (1) SPEC for support of
non-disk units?
b) if (strcmp(a, "no"))
      Do you know anything about it, ie is it SATA1 or 2 or what?
c) Let's ponder one gets a unit like this - is it usable with
libata yet?
d) if (strcmp(c, "no"))
      Will it? :)
