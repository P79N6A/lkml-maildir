looking at the kernel source, after constant failures to boot linux on a core 
2 imac, has made me understand that only i386 and ia64 support efi booting, 
but x86_64 does not.
it makes sense, if you think about it... AFAIK, until the new core 2 imacs 
were out there was no x86_64 efi pc, so why should the kernel support it?
i would like to ask that the efi boot code be ported to x86_64 and so people 
would not have to use boot camp and bios emulation to boot linux on new 
imacs.
thank you for your time and help.
P.S.
i'm not currently subscribed to the lkml, so please CC me when you reply.
