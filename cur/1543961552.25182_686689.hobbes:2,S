Sure, but the whole point is: lockdep cannot track those rules. _that_
is why I'm choosing to forbid them.
Also, on Linux only rwlock_t allows reader recursion, and that lock type
really ought to die, all users should convert to RCU (if possible).
So I'm not thinking placing this restriction on kernel code is going to
be painful.
