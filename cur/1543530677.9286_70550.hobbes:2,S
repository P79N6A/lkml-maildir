 Hello,
 I have a Promise Ultra66 and the only 2.3.x kernel I can get it to work
 with is kernel 2.3.34.  All newer kernels hang while recognizing the
 drive after a reboot. I could not find any relevant info in my logs, but
 I have tried a number of other options to see if somehow that would make 
 a difference.  They did not.  If you would be so kind, please forward 
 this to the individual responsible for maintaining this code.  Thank you.  
 As I am not subscribed to this list, should you have any questions,
