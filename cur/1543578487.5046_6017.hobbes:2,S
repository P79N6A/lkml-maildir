I'm not familiar enough with the tcp code to know if this patch (against
-ac6) is a solution, band-aid, or, in fact, wrong, but I've run with it
(on -ac3) and haven't seen the errors for over twelve hours, which is
three times longer than it had been able to go without it coming up.

Or would this be better?

Or making mss_now unsigned in the first place?
