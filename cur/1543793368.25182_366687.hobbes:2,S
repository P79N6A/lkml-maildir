 Yes, BF56x does have two cores in one chip. But we are not going to
make it a SMP system. The second core is going to be used as a pure
DSP, do some encode/decode work. Remember Blackfin itself is a DSP
anyway.

  Actually current BF5xx DSPs don't have a real MMU. It runs uClinux.
The called  "MMU" in the mannual is only a cache management and memory
protect unit, not a virtual memory unit.
