The picture fit so well with this bug I fixed I must say I'm suprised.
Well don't be sorry; you helped me indirectly track down something that
was a real bug I had missed anyway, so this update is necessary
regardless. I think for the sake of signal to noise ratio on lkml we
should take this discussion off list. Can you email me all the info you
have to date about the stalled processes and I'll take it from there?
