Correct me if I'm wrong, but this test is largely seek-bound, is it not?
Do you monitor the total CPU utilisation during the run?  Is it generally
low?  If so then we're seek-bound.
File layout will influence things a lot.  Small variations in timing and in
CPU scheduler activity could well cause significant dfifferences in file
layout.
Does the test generate the files on-the-fly, or are they laid out
beforehand?
Is it possible to fully populate the datafiles before the run, with a
single thread of control?  That will ensure that each run is working off
the same layout and will give a better basis for comparison.
It will also tell us that some layout tweaks may be needed.
