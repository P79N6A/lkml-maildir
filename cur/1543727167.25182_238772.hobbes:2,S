hum, interesting.  Can Con's changes affect the inter-node and inter-cpu
balancing decisions, or is this all due to caching effects, reduced context
switching etc?
I don't expect we'll be merging a new CPU scheduler into mainline any time
soon, but we should work to understand where this improvement came from,
and see if we can get the mainline scheduler to catch up.
