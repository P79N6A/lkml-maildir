Ok.  If you have tested on a wide variety of machines then I won't
worry about it.
I guess if a cr0 write has always been synchronizing things should be
a safe practice.  The practical danger is if you write to cr0 and the
pipeline is not flushed and the segment loads might execute as 16bit
mode segment register loads.  I think this is more of a 486 or 586/Pentium
danger actually then a 386 one.
Hmm. I'm not certain about enabling protected mode but enabling paging
at least does appear to be documented to require a jump, before the P6
core.  Which may be why it is recommended for initializing protected
mode.
