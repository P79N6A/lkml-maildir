At this time it doesn't matter, it is just a dummy include, that I cut and pasted from
../asm-arm/suspend.h.  #ifndef makes more sense.  I should have probably
looked more closely at the code and also probably inserted a "/* dummy include */"
line in between #define and #endif. 
Thank you for paying attention.
