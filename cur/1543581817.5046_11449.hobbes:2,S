First off, I'd like to say that I'm highly sympathetic to this, assuming that 
a kernel debugger doesn't change the kernel's behavior.

you might look at UML (
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net
) for this.  A 
number of kernel hackers are very successfully using UML for doing filesystem 
and mm development and debugging.  With some help from the host, it's also 
possible to do driver development under UML.
I also know of a number of people using UML to further their education by 
using it to poke around a running kernel.

So, if you can't convince Buddha of the wisdom of your arguments (or even if 
you can) check out UML.  It makes a perfectly good kernel debugger available, 
and it's a lot easier to deal with than a native kernel.
