Try `dmesg -n 7' first.

You won't get anything useful from sysrq-p via /proc/sysrq-trigger - it'll
just show the backtrace of the process `echo'.  It has to be via the
keyboard.
If there's no keyboard, do `echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger' to get an
all-task backtrace, then locate the trace for kswapd in the resulting
output.
Thanks.
