I have clarified that we only use one lock for all queues and it is held as specified in ll_rw_block.c. The locking needs to be redone for maximum efficiency but schedules don't permit that work at this time. This was done to fix an Oops with multiple logical volumes on a controller.

Is the hardware's command buffer per-device or per-HBA?
