It is a really old kernel... Maybe you could try with some of the
recent ones?

Yes, this is the file.
I extend the part you quoted. The file is opened here:
open(".git/objects/pack_awOTNW", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0600) = 3
write(3, "PACK\0\0\0\2\0\0\3r", 12)     = 12
... lots of data. Counted writes: 488538...
write(3, "v\351\247V\325\362\327/\240\265\211\211\322,\261\210\301"..., 4096) = 4096
write(3, "\202\202g\232Bf\211Bf\261Bb\36X\22\4\364\365\25\22\223"..., 1114) = 1114
write(3, "M", 1)                        = 1
> write(2, "Resolving 551 deltas.\n", 22)                               = 22

That's the problem.  Hmm... May I kindly suggest moving the topic to
linux-nfs (cc-ed along with lk)?
