Well, I don't understand why we have to clear the allocation memory.
I suggest we just remove the memset(addr, 0, len) operation at all.
Read the malloc manual, you'll get
--------
malloc() allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
****The memory is not cleared.****
--------
So, if not clearing the memory causes one application hang/crash,
that's the bug of that application and it need to be fixed.
The patch in my option is:
------------------------------------
diff --git a/mm/nommu.c b/mm/nommu.c
