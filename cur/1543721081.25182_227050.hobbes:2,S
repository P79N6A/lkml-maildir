sorry to confuse. no, i'm not able to tell any relevant information from
your oops. i must say that it just occured *to me* that we had different
oopses and lockups with fcdsl and fcpci (!) modules, which were hard to
reproduce too.
you said:

so 2.4.23 did work? would be strange, since patch-2.4.24.b2 is only
2,5KB in size and touches very few things. good for you: if 2.4.23 is
really working and 2.4.24 is not, you could back out the changes and see
what it gives.
just my 2¢,
Christian.
