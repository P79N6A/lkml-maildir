It's a window (in the form of a BAR - base and mask) within which
IOMMU mapping always takes place.  Outside the window everything is
bypass.
This applies to all x86-64 machines and some i386 machines, in
particular those i386 chipsets with "full GART" support as opposed to
"AGP only GART" (my terminology.)
Andi likes to say this isn't a real IOMMU (mostly because it doesn't
solve the legacy region problem), but I disagree with that view.  It
still would be nicer if it covered more address space, though.
I don't know if it would be worthwhile to support "full GART" on the
i386 systems which support it.
