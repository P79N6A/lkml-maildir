Right. But atomic_add_unless() is slower as it is
essentially a loop. See my previous letter in this sub-thread.

Did you ever look at how get_empty_filp() works?
I agree, that this is not a "strict" limit, but it
limits the usage wit some "precision".
/* off-the-topic */ Herbert, you've lost Balbir again:
In this sub-thread some letters up Eric wrote a letter with
Balbir in Cc:. The next reply from you doesn't include him.
