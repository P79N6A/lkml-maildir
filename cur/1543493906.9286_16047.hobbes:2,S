Actually, I believe that my application requires this functionality.  I
am doing a specialized type of RAID thingy that doesn't fit well into
the framework of any of the raid personalities that MD currently uses.
And to be more precise, I don't really want to do "file" I/O as much
as I want to do "block device" I/O.  I want to write to /dev/sdb3 or
a loopback driver, not actually an ext2 file.
