That's easy -- it found the longest path from A to B and generated patches
between each step.
Looking at the latest tree with gitk, I'd guess that the previous rate
of roughly 50% is no longer achievable; linearizing would aggregate
some large chunks of patch-series and subtree merges (no surprise there).
