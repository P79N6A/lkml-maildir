Linus, please confirm.
Firmware for cards can be proprietary.  It can either be installed by a
userspace utility on startup (nothing to do with the kernel) or it can
be installed by the kernel driver for the card during initialization.
In the latter case, the image must be supplied in text format and
converted to binary, no binary files in the kernel tarball.
