Hi Davide
I just took a 10 minutes look before running away this morning, I'll try to 
test this to get performance numbers in about 12 hours.

Here you broke POSIX I'm afraid.
You might need some test like
     if (start <= fmap->fdnext)
         fmap->fdnext = fd + 1;
Also I'm not sure the first unlikely() and likely() are worth it.
They probably match the user code you wrote yourself :)
Best thing is probably let the compiler generate a 50/50 code and let CPU uses 
its predictors.
