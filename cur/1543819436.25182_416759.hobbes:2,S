Without that patch, there is a race when registering network interfaces 
and renaming it with udev rules, because initially the "address" in 
sysfs doesn't contain useful data. See 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=114460338900002&r=1&w=2
Breaking the recommended way of assigning persistent network interface 
names is, IMHO, a bug serious enough to be fixed in -stable.
