Yes, it's trivial to reproduce without any options:
    [ 2311.759856] ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1b.0[B] -> GSI 17 (level, low) -> IRQ 21
    [ 2311.759866] hda_intel: probe_mask set to 0x1 for device 17aa:2010
    [ 2311.759886] PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:1b.0 to 64
    [ 2312.911309] hda_intel: azx_get_response timeout, switching to polling mode: last cmd=0x003f000c
(By the way, what's wrong with using the enable_msi option?  MSI seems
very solid on Intel platforms, and I prefer avoiding shared interrupts)
