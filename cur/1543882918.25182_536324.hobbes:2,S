We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.21.1 kernel.
This release has two bugfixes for networking issues that should cause
all users of ipv4 or ipv6 to upgrade to this version.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.21 and 2.6.21.1
The updated 2.6.21.y git tree can be found at:
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.21.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
        www.kernel.org/git/
thanks,
greg k-h
