the advantage to standardizing what's there is that it makes it easier
to make subsequent changes.  as a perfect example, because there are
several variations to the use of "sizeof", trying to catch every
combination that might be replaceable by the use of ARRAY_SIZE() is
just that much harder since you'd have to (as i had to) use regular
expressions to check for every variant -- parentheses or no
parentheses?  space after the word or not?  internal spaces within the
parentheses?
all that variation makes global changes for more useful stuff a real
pain.
