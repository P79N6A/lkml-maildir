Subject: [PATCH] Hide struct ustat in include/linux/types.h from userspace?; needed to build glibc-2.3.2 on sh4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/21/179

I have to apply the following patch, kindly sent to me by
Kaz Kojima, to the 2.4.19/2.4.20 kernel in
order to build glibc-2.3.2 for the sh4 processor.
All it does is hide the kernel's definition of struct ustat
from userspace.  This prevents a clash with the userspace
definition of struct ustat.
I verified this has not yet been applied as of 2.4.22-pre1.
I'm not familiar enough with the kernel/c-library interface to
know whether this patch is the proper fix, but it's the one
being used by the sh-linux folks.
The symptom without this patch is:
In file included from sys/ustat.h:30,
                  from ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/ustat.c:21:
../sysdeps/generic/bits/ustat.h:26: error: redefinition of `struct ustat'
make[2]: *** [/build/sh4-unknown-linux-gnu/gcc-3.3-glibc-2.3.2/build-glibc/misc/ustat.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/build/sh4-unknown-linux-gnu/gcc-3.3-glibc-2.3.2/glibc-2.3.2/misc'
Yeah, I know the sh folks have their own kernel tree, but IMHO
one ought at least be able to build working toolchains with the
vanilla vger kernel headers.   I now have a script that builds
cross-toolchains for many architectures from scratch at
  
http://kegel.com/crosstool
and I'm trying to nudge patches into the main trees of gcc, glibc, and linux
so their next vanilla releases can be used to build working
cross-compilers targeting every architecture glibc supports
without patches.
