I agree about the latter one, but "+m" (which is what the kernel uses) has
well-defined meaning, and the compiler would be/is silly to complain about
it.
So your arguments fall down flat. If it was
	"=m" (x) : "0" (y)
I'd agree with you, but that's not the code the compiler complains about.
Shorthand or not, the "+m" usage is (a) totally logical and (b) 
historically allowed.
Please fix the compiler.
