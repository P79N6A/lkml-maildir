Perhaps I misread what Linus said, the issue I was suggesting be 
addressed was one of clarity to the testers, not the developers. The 
releases identified as test would be for evaluation, while the ones 
identified as rc would really be candidates with no "fix before next 
version" bugs known. I  would think that between test releases some bugs 
could be fixed, but new features could be added. That would encourage 
more active testing without overly slowing the development process.
Having used that for a long time for 2.2 and 2.4 I think there's quite a 
track record of that nomenclature being clear to the users.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
