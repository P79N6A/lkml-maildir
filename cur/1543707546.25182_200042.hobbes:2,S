It's BSD licensed - they couldn't distribute it together with GPFS if
it was GPL.

Well, something that needs an almost one megabyte big wrapper per defintion
is not a standalone work but something that's deeply interwinded with
the kernel.  The tons of kernel version checks certainly show it's poking
deeper than it should.

See above.  Something that pokes deep into internal structures and even
needs new exports certainly is a derived work.  There's a few different
interpretations of the derived works clause in the GPL around, the FSF
one wouldn't allow binary modules at all, and Linus' one is also pretty
strict.
