I need to deploy some very resilient servers with hot swapable drives.
I always used dac960 based hardware raid for hot swapping in the past, but 
sata drives are so cheap compared to scsi that I'm considering the Tyan GT24 
server with 4 hot swappable SATA II drives (nforce4 pro controller)

Before I place an order, I need to know whether sata II hot swapping is up to 
scratch in the linux kernel, and whether it works nicely with linux software 
raid (which I already use/am familiar with).
Any knowledge greatfully accepted :)
