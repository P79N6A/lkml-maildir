If the millisecond resolution is enough for these users, that means the 
current msleep will work fine for them.

This generalization is simply not true. First it requires the 
HIGH_RES_TIMERS option to be enabled to really make a real difference. 
Second a hrtimers based msleep has a higher setup cost, which can't be 
completely ignored. "Best" is a subjective term here and can't be that 
easily generalized to all current users.

We only need one sleep implementation of both and msleep is a fine name 
for the current implementation - not only does it describe the unit, but 
it also describe the best resolution one can expect from it.

I can give the question back, what do you have against simple timers, that 
you want to make them as awkward as possible to use?
hrtimer have a higher usage cost depending on the clock source, so simply 
using them only because they are the new cool kid in town doesn't make 
sense. It may not be that critical for a simple sleep implementation, but 
that only means we should keep the API as simple as possible, that means 
one low resolution, cheap msleep and one high resolution nanosleep is 
enough. Why do you insist on making more complex than necessary?
bye, Roman
