yup, cancellation doesn't work at present.

c) would work.  I guess we could do that by simply counting the number of
called handlers rather than having to record state within each one.
It would require changes to the notifier_chain API, but I think the changes
are needed - the problem is general.  Something like:
int __raw_notifier_call_chain(struct raw_notifier_head *nh,
		unsigned long val, void *v, unsigned nr_to_call, int *nr_called);
int raw_notifier_call_chain(struct raw_notifier_head *nh,
		unsigned long val, void *v)
{
	return __raw_notifier_call_chain(nh, val, v, -1, NULL);
}
