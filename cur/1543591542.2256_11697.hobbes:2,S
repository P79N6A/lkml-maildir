While browsing IBM ThinkPads online I noticed only one high-end
model with linux.  I called 1-888-SHOP-IBMx7000 (phone sales)
to inquire how to get a ThinkPad without Windows given I would
be immediately installing linux.
I was offered 6% off the online price for any Thinkpad which in
my case was $118 US. That sounded about right for a per unit
bundle deal between IBM and MS.
I called from the US and the phone rep was in Canada.
rgds,
tim.
