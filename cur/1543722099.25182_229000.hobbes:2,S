Right. It might happen once in a (long) while that
'ps -f' doesn't show the correct command line.

Please note that the stack is that of the translator, which
is aware of the fixing of argv.

Using ELF notes means changing the binaries, which is not
suitable for cases where the use of translator for running
the binaries is not 'known' to the binaries. For example,
an administrator might start using a translator to enhance
performance of existing binaries. In such a case, re-building
the binaries will probably be out of the question.

Do you mean enhancing sys_prctl to allow for fixing 
the argv ? 
Thanks,
Yoav.
