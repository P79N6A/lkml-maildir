I originally thought that I could implement something similar to the
Synaptics driver. Unfortunately, while in transparent mode bytes are
relayed unmodified with the TrackPoint controller disabled. In other
words, no simultaneous usage.
That doesn't mean extended protocol mice couldn't be supported in
transparent mode however. I didn't find it particularly useful given
the TrackPoint itself would be disabled.
