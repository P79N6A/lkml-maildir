	A quick real world example of where fadvise can work well.
Imagine a database appliction that doesn't use O_DIRECT (for whatever
reason, could even be that they don't trust the linux implementation yet
:-).  So, this database gets a query.  That query requires a full table
scan, so it calls fadvise(fd, F_SEQUENTIAL).  Then another query does
row-specific access, and caching helps.  So it wants to turn off
F_SEQUENTIAL.
	Other applications can use this sort of stuff.  DBM could, for
instance.  So might GIMP.  Etc.  Dynamic hints have real world
applications.
