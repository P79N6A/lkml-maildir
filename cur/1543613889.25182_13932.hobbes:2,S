It doesn't change syntax, but anything lower than -O1 simply doesn't
inline functions with an "inline" attribute. The result is that the
inline functions in header files won't get inlined and the compiler
will complain about missing functions at link time (or module insert
time).
I'm actually surprised that 2.2 can be compiled with -O, AFAIK
linux-2.2 also has a lot of inline functions in headers. I know from
experience that -Os works for 2.4 kernels on ARM, I haven't tested it
with 2.2 or x86.
