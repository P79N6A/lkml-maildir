Thanks to all for advise. It seems it's problem with iBCS module.
Here is an example, that show it:
++ /sbin/lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
++ some_program_what_need_iBCS
++ /sbin/lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
iBCS                  119100   0  (autoclean)
++ sudo /sbin/rmmod -a
++ sudo /sbin/rmmod -a
++ /sbin/lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
iBCS                  119100   0  (autoclean)
++ sudo /sbin/modprobe -k cdrom
++ sudo /sbin/modprobe -k ide-cd
++ sudo /bin/mount -o ro /dev/hdb /cdrom
++ sudo /bin/umount /cdrom
++ /sbin/lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
ide-cd                 21080   0  (autoclean)
cdrom                  12048   0  (autoclean) [ide-cd]
iBCS                  119100   0  (autoclean)
++ sudo /sbin/rmmod -a
++ sudo /sbin/rmmod -a
++ /sbin/lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
# the End
