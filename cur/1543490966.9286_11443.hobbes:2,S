I know I had to set the options parameter in /etc/modules.conf to specify
the media type on my Linksys PNIC-based card.  Sometimes, despite the
specified media type (100TX half-duplex) the cards would wind up in 10 mbps
mode.  So once the card driver installs (if it does install successfully
at all), check the blinkenlights on the card and the hub...
