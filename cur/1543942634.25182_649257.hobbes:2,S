I did solve some compile issues since posting, Ingo should have the
compiling version in sched-devel soonish (don't know if he pushed it
already).

Thats a case of wrong expectations in my book. You enabled group
scheduling and hence behaviour changes. There is just nothing much one
can do about it, if you don't assign bandwidth to a group, it won't be
able to run anything. Better to refuse to run, than to sit idle, right?
But I appreciate the situation, therefore I made the whole rt-group
scheduling a separate .config option (which defaults to n)
