Stop there... _why_ is the inode still in the icache after the object
has been deleted? It sounds like this is your real problem. Once the
last link to it goes, and the last file handle to it is closed, it
should be gone immediately. 
It sounds like you're doing too much in your unlink method. The object
isn't necessarily dead at the time you unlink it -- it could still be
open. You just decrement its nlink and wait for the VFS to tell you it's
done with it.

->clear_inode() or ->delete_inode() as Andreas said.

It's safe but it doesn't sound correct. It sounds like a workaround for
the real problem.

No. If these people want new file systems and new features in code code,
why on earth are they still using 2.4.18? They should be on 2.6, or at
_least_ current 2.4 kernels. I could sort of understand if they've had a
lot of testing in the two and a half years since 2.4.18 was released and
they don't want to change _anything_.... but that obviously isn't the
case if they're adding new stuff like this.
