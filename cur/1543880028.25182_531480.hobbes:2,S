Have you considered using rq->raw_weighted_load instead of 
rq->nr_running in calculating fair_clock?  This would take the nice 
value (or RT priority) of the other tasks into account when determining 
what's fair.

PS You'd have to change the migration thread's load_weight from 0 to 1 
in order to prevent divide by zero without having to explicitly check 
for it every time.
