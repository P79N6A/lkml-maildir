Yep, the netlink people should be able to help - they known what would be
required for not sending messages in case there is no listener registered.
Maybe its already possible? I have never used netlink myself.

The netlink data will be sent to userspace at fork/exec/exit hooks - one wants
to avoid that if there are no listeners, so setups which dont want to run the 
accounting daemon dont pay the cost of building and sending the information 
through netlink. 
Thats what Andrew asked for if I understand correctly.

That would be one hack, although it is uglier than the pure netlink 
selection.

Andrew has been talking about sending data over netlink to implement the 
accounting at userspace, so this piece of code is out of the game, no?
