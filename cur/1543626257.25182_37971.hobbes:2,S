Yep I understand that, it was more a request for comments on the API, to
learn if they've any design limitation with that generic API, I know it
would be tricky to convert xfs, not something I'd expect in a minor
release, I was talking a bit longer term, not necessairly for 2.4. XFS
doesn't journal data so my point was it should be just fine in theory
with the current aops direct_IO API.
For 2.5 we also need a generic library function that puts anchors into
the pagecache hash too, simulating locked pages, to serialize the I/O on
the data too during O_DIRECT to allow cleanly O_DIRECT with _data_
journaling.

Avoiding code duplication and taking the API simpler is the good part,
but I see nfs would be penalized (first it allocates and the
deallocates). I agree it's not the best design to get the maximal
performance with nfs and some other, it was mostly a 2.4 thing infact,
as you say with 2.5 if the kiobuf overhead is dropped then we may not
need to preallocate the kiobuf in the first place, then this whole
discussion about "where to preallocate" will be pointless. Also the
kiobuf-slab patch should just make it significantly faster compared to
the current prohibitive vmalloc.

Ok.
Thanks,
