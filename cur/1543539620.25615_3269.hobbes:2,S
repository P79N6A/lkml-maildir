I really would hate to damage my hd because of a small mistake while
experimenting with some low-level ioctls.
Haven't looked at the patch but IMHO many parts of kernel contain tons
of "superfluous" checks against root's stupidity that would cause a reboot 
in the worst case, so I don't understand why accepting the patch is such
an issue. 
I would understand technical objections, but "root can do anything anyway"
is not very convincing. One way more or less to shoot my foot can make 
a difference in real life.
Maybe the kernel should have a special kill-the-machine ioctl just for the
pleasure of script kiddies and sadistic sysadmins. Would make the kernel 
ABI much cleaner and remove the need for many security checks.
Bye
