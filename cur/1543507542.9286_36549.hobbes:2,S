  I will repeat : the lockups only happen with certain cards.
any clues as to which cards? Mine has Buslogic BT-958, £Com 595,
Matrox G200SD AGP and an Avance Logic ALS100 ISA soundcard in it.
Also, i enabled PCI quirks, which printed out a message at boot-time
about working around ISA-DMA hangs. Which printed out the following:

Machine has been up since the date mentioned in the logs. So perhaps
it's already a known and accounted for bug?
Do the people who's machines hang have pci quirks enabled?
