Hello everyone,
I am trying to boot Linux kernel on OMAP5912 CPU(arch/arm/mach-omap1)
containing ARM926 core.
I have configured my Linux kernel to run in tickless mode. In the
final steps of booting, kernel is encountering " NULL pointer
dereference " in the function " rb_erase() " called from " __remove_hrtimer() ".
Following is the backtrace log emitted by the kernel.
Backtrace:

---[ end trace b0a66fe3e48abdda ]---
Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill the idle task!
What I understand is, address of nonexistent node is passed to rb_erase()?
Can anybody please direct me, how to investigate further into this problem?
I kindly request you to personally CC me your responses. Thanks a lot.
