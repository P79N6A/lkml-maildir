Umm...  Obvious comments:
a) typedef struct super_block vfs_sb;  Please don't.
b) in inode.c:
	inode->i_mode = (umode_t) raw_inode->mode;
is wrong.  It's guaranteed bug either on big- or little-endian boxen.
Same for mtime, uid and gid.  befs_count_blocks() also needs cleanup.
c) befs_read_block()...  Erm.  Why bother with extra layer of abstraction?
d) befs_readdir().  You _are_ guaranteed that inode is non-NULL, you put
pointer to befs_dir_operations only is S_ISDIR is true and S_ISDIR is
mutually exclusive with S_ISLNK.
e) are there sparse files on BeFS?  If yes - you want to make BH_Mapped
conditional in get_block() (set it if block is present, don't if it's a
hole in file).
f) befs_arch().  You probably want to make that an option...
g) endianness problems in read_super()...
h) TODO: use line breaks ;-)
