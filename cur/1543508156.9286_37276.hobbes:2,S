Alan,
Many thanks for the tip. One word "io_request" makes big difference since
other part has been checked many times and no seeing any problem there.
I checked code again and noticed the
spin_lock_irqsave()/spin_unlock_irqrestore() pair in my driver ISR was
ifdefed out during the compiling.  The reason for it is when I include
asm/smp.h and asm/spinlock.h for SMP support, compiler complained a lot of
undefined symbols in those included files and failed.  So I did not using
that because I thought the spin_lock functions is for MP system only.
I am also using set_bit()/clear_bit() to protect driver private data
structure.
Now I added spin_lock_irqsave()/spin_unlock_irqrestore() pair back in ISR
but still not include asm/smp.h and asm/spinlock.h, everything looks OK!
Really appreciate your help and others who feed back!!!

Unless it stamps on things or overflows its stack or..
Memory corruption is probably the most probable one although nothing 
suprises me as a driver bug any more.

Ok so your fibrechannel side is apparently behaving right.

Check all the memory allocations you do. Also check you catch any NULL
returns. Also check use of the io_request lock - although I'd expect you
to find 'request list destroyed' messages if that was wrong.
It could be sd.c not doing checks so look at that too.
Another one to check is that your scatter gather limits are right. Does
the card blow up doing pure writes ?

Connect a serial port of system 1 to system 2, and boot system 1 with
the serial console options. All system messages then go down the serial
port
