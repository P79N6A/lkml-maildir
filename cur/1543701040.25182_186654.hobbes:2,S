I guess that explains why the Synaptics driver didn't cause any problems

Looking at that page, I'll guess that SuSE 8.2's version of XFree86 probably

That's OK, Alps supplies notebook vendors with drivers for Monopolysoft
OSes, and it seems that Alps hasn't completely got this working correctly
either.
