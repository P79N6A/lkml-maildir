Good point. I believe you _do_ end up having to do that, like it or not.
Because if you don't lock the bridge (or whatever the entity is that keeps 
track of errors), the whole exercise is kind of pointless. If two drivers 
try to do error checking at the same time, and will potentially clear the 
errors of each other, causing the errors to get lost, the whole recovery 
infrastructure is clearly worthless.

Some serialization will happen. Inevitable. See above.
The "good news" is that I doubt very many drivers will care enough to do
this. I suspect you'll only have a few very specific drivers used in 
fault-tolerant circumstances, where you care more about the errors than 
about the inevitable serialization.

It will have to depend on the bus setup. Not arch-specific per se, but 
clearly specific to the bus controllers in question.
