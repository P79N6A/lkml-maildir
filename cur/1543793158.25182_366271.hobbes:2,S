That sounds reasonable. However, for now, I'll just keep the old code.
In my patch I pulled the loop based and TSC based delay functions out of
the timer_opts and pick one at boot depending on if the TSC is around or
not.
I'm testing it now and will be sending out a new patchset before I head
home tonight.
