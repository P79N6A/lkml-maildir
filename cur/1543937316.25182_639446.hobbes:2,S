Could use exactly the same in fault_64.c

With the ongoing unification work, it would be nice if we could come
up with a way to unify printks like this.  Anyone have any bright ideas
on a format that will keep the current alignment on 32 and 64 bit with
the same syntax, or will these tiny ifdefs keep sprouting?
