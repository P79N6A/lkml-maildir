Perhaps this will suit your taste better...
I'd love to extend this work to support Paul Russell's hotplug cpu work, but 
I have absolutely no way at present to test it. (If some kind party would 
like to donate a quad pentium 4 Xeon with hotplug cpu support, I'll be more 
than happy to do so ;)
This is against 2.4.18-pre9-ac4 with devfs v199.9
Relevent comments, advise, improvisations, flames, welcome.
