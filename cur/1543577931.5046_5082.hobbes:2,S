I wasn't aware Andrea switched the way he stored his patches
lately ;)
But seriously, you're right that this is a good thing. I'll
work on splitting out my patches and documenting what each
part does.
(but not now, I'm headed off for Australia ... maybe I can
split out the patches on my way there and cvs commit when
I'm there)
OTOH, the advantage of having a big patch means that it's
easier for me to get people to test all of the things I
have. Guess I'll need to find a way to easily get both the
small and the big patches ;)
regards,
Rik
