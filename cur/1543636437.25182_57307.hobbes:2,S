Hi Trond,
I got the following after trying to do tab completion in an NFS fs, and 
straight afterwards on another console df(1).  the client finally 
recovered though.
nfs: task 626 can't get a request slot
nfs: task 627 can't get a request slot
nfs: server montezuma OK
nfs: server montezuma OK
Cheers,
