No, it's not.  If the on disk format needs to change, it's usually a
sign that the code has changed enough to warrant a version change.  And
there are examples of that all over the kernel.  Ext3, JFFS2, and
Reiser4, are just a few.  The SquashFS code is very useful as it is
today.  There is no reason to delay it's inclusion because it has a 4GiB
limitation.
And while I agree that something should be included in the kernel for
the "right" reasons, you still have to listen to users.  In this case,
those users range from the embedded world to actual distributions.
This is a useful, stable, and _maintained_ filesystem and I'm a bit
surprised that there is this much resistance to it's inclusion.
