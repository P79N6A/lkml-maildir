Aha. There is a bug in the ISDN code - something goes wrong when
TCP timestamps are enabled in the TCP layer and VJ compression is
enabled in the ISDN layer. There has been a thread on this list
about it a week ago.
When using ISDN, either disable TCP timestamps or VJ compression.
Even better find the bug and post the patch here :)
Mike.
