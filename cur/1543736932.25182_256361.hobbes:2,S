As I stated earlier, there *seemed* to be a working IO-APIC NMI watchdog
with 2.6.3-mm4.  I never checked it's functionallity. Now I rebuilt that
kernel and gave it a try.  Though it claims to have a running IO-APIC NMI
watchdog, the lockupcli test failed.  Zwane was right when he suspected the
nmi_watchdog=1 test working erratically in that case.  Sad but true: no NMI
watchdog on tyan S2466.  I wonder if it's just impossible on such a board
or if it needs some "special treatment"
