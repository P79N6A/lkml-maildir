It's the core "struct device" shrinkage patch:
	ChangeSet@1.2092.3.1, 2004-11-12 11:41:25-08:00, david-b@pacbell.net
	  [PATCH] driver core: shrink struct device a bit
	  This patch removes two fields from "struct device" that are duplicated
	  in "struct dev_pm_info":  power_state (which should probably vanish)
	  and "saved_state".  There were only two "real" uses of saved_state;
	  both are now switched over to use dev_pm_info.

so I think the people involved agree with you on moving it ever outwards..
