Hi All,
Enclosed are four bugs where 2.4.4-ac8 kernel code appears to directly
read/write user space pointers.  The latter three were found after
forming equivalence classes by:
	(1) recording all routines assigned to the same function pointer
	    field in a structure
	(2) if any member of the equiv class treated a parameter as a
	    user-space pointer, checking that they all do.
Let me know if any of these are wrong.  The first one seems pretty bad.

[BUG] raddr seems to be a user pointer, but is written at the end of
      the system call.
ipc/shm.c: ERROR: system call 'sys_shmat' derefs non-tainted param= 3

        *raddr = (unsigned long) user_addr;
        err = 0;
        if (IS_ERR(user_addr))
                err = PTR_ERR(user_addr);

their second parameter as tainted, but two functions use it raw.
