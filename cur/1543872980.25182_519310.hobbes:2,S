OK, this confused me:
        Function reordering (REORDER) [N/y/?] (NEW) ?
        This option enables the toolchain to reorder functions for a more 
        optimal TLB usage. If you have pretty much any version of binutils, 
        this can increase your kernel build time by roughly one minute.
"If you have pretty much any version of binutils"?  Huh?
You mean "This will slow your kernel build by about a minute"?
Rusty.
