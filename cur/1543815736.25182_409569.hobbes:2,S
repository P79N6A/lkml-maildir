Ahh. Isn't this the same problem that the fairly recent "mm: compound 
release fix" by Nick should fix?
Git commit ID 8519fb30e438f8088b71a94a7d5a660a814d3872, to be exact:

    [PATCH] mm: compound release fix
    Compound pages on SMP systems can now often be freed from pagetables via
    the release_pages path.  This uses put_page_testzero which does not handle
    compound pages at all.  Releasing constituent pages from process mappings
    decrements their count to a large negative number and leaks the reference
    at the head page - net result is a memory leak.
    The problem was hidden because the debug check in put_page_testzero itself
    actually did take compound pages into consideration.
    Fix the bug and the debug check.

But anything based on 2.6.16-rc6 should be fine (The bug was fixed by 
2.6.16-rc3, methinks). You said:
   "First of all, it turns out that the BUG I mentioned was reported 
    against the SLES10 2.6.16-rc6 kernel.  I haven't had a chance to chase 
    it down yet, but I'm going to have to, because..."
but if that _really_ is 2.6.16-rc6-based, this problem should have been 
fixed already.
Maybe SLES is based on 2.6._15_-rc6?
