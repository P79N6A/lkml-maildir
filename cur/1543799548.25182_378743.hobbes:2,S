Subject: [patch 2.6.14-rc6-git 0/6] SPI core, refresh
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I've had several requests recently for the latest standalone
version of these patches, so here it is:  six patches, posted
right after this message.  This is very close to what's in the
2.6.15-rc5-mm3 patches, modulo bitbang tweaks and more drivers.
In sequence:
  # core
  spi.patch
  # protocol drivers
  ads7846.patch
  dataflash.patch
  m25p80.patch
  # bitbang utilities
  bitbang_spi.patch
  # bitbang adapter (example)
  butterfly.patch
The new drivers are for M25P series SPI Flash, and a parport
adapter cable for a $20 AVR microcontroller board.
