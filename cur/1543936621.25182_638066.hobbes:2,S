Ok.

Whoops, totally oversaw this one.  Of course, this must be in.
Perhaps an even more generic solution would be good, like this:
#define section_printk(sect, fmt, args...) ({		\
	static const sect char __fmt[] = fmt;		\
        printk(__fmt, ## args);				\
})
And then just have convenience wrappers like {,dev}init_printk, ... etc.
Can someone please shout at us if there is a fundamental problem with
this approach?
