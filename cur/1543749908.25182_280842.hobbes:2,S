we are using a RedHat AS3 U3 box (2.4.21-4.ELsmp) to run a very
intensive database app which does a _huge_ number of inserts durnig
the data generation phase. However, we are noticing a unexpected
performance drops with user cpu utilization numbers falling to near 0.
most of the cpu is used up in iowait. 
CPU states:  cpu    user    nice  system    irq  softirq  iowait    idle

/proc/slabinfo showed huge numbers in buffer_head. The line was:

Interestingly, the swap is not being used at all
free output:
Swap:      2040212      10104    2030108
the box is 
Quad AMD Opteron 1.8Ghz 
Tyan Mother board S4882UG2NR 
with Rack Chassis, 12 X 1 Hot swap bays, power supply +  RPS Support
32Gb DDr sdram @ 266
8 X 80Gb SATA Hot Swap Hard Drive, 7200 RPM
Adaptec  SATA RAID controller
I tried to google but found some kswapd related bugs in AS3 which were
fixed in U3. We upgraded even though this does not seem to be a kswapd
error. I am gussing I have used some inappropriate numbers while
setting up the box.
Would someone be kind to point me in a direction where I can find more
information?
thanks a lot!
