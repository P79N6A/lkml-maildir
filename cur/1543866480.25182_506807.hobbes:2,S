GCC 4.1 optimizes both Andrew's and Frederik Deweerdt's ideas 
perfectly out. Even if the const was not there in Frederik's example, 
gcc seems throw it out with -O2 (judging by `nm` output) since it is
1. static 2. unused. Gcc even gives out a warning that the item is 
unused when not marked with const.
