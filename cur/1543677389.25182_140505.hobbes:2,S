Hello Mark,
I see the same behavior with 2.4.21-rc7-ac1 and the cs46xx sound module.
I have tried installing the alsa modules and have also removed them.  I 
don't know where that behavior is coming from.
In the gnome-cd program I see the play time rather randomly jump
forward and back to different places in the audio track.  Audio is 
disrupted for sometimes several seconds for every few bars of the 
recording.
If you run into any information on what is causing this let me know.  I am
not convinced it is a kernel feature... but it is at the very least 
annoying.  It makes listening to CDs impossible.
Dave
