The docs still have entries for stdcall, but all recent snapshots choke
on __switch_to()...
egcs-2.93.21 -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g1 -pg -pipe  -DCPU=586 -mcpu=pentium -march=pentium
 -c -o process.o process.c
 process.c:718: conflicting types for `__switch_to'
 /usr/src/linux/include/asm/system.h:15: previous declaration of `__switch_to'
 make[1]: *** [process.o] Error 1 
from 2.2.8-pre4+ikd/include/asm/system.h...
#ifndef CONFIG_KERNEL_DEBUGGING /* Fix the FASTCALL thing -arca */
extern void FASTCALL(__switch_to(struct task_struct *prev, struct task_struct *next));
#else
extern void __switch_to(struct task_struct *prev, struct task_struct *next)
         __attribute__((stdcall));
#endif
and from 2.2.8-pre4+ikd/include/linux/kernel.h
#if defined(__i386__) && !defined(CONFIG_KERNEL_DEBUGGING)
#define FASTCALL(x)  x __attribute__((regparm(3)))
#else
#define FASTCALL(x)  x
#endif
egcs-1.1.2, older snapshots and various other gcc versions are ok with
the prototype.

[ ] Attribute usage changed?
[ ] It has a bug?
[ ] It hates me?
[*] Nope, no ideas that don't generate instant reboot. :)
