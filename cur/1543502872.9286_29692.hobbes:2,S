Sure, I'm happy with a new kind of process group. In the docs we can
say "this is for threads". Couple that with a new kill() syscall which
does "kill one of a group" and we can support POSIX semantics.

I don't disagree with those points. I must say I really like the way
clone() works. It Looks Right.
The question in my mind is whether there is a way of providing POSIX
semantics cleanly, or do we tell POSIX to shove it? If at the end of
the day, we can't cleanly provide POSIX semantics, we should try and
get POSIX fixed^Wchanged. If that's not possible, I say we tell them
to get rooted. I think we've gotten to the point where we're better
off violating (obscure) POSIX semantics and keeping the kernel clean,
rather than uglifying the kernel to support unnecessary semantics.
Others may disagree ;-)
