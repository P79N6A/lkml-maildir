They best way to get your patches into the kernel might be to send them 
through Andrew, who will add them to his -mm tree and later forward them 
to Linus.
If I assume correctly that "I have been sent some patches recently" 
means half a dozen patches and the whole amount of patches every year 
might be two dozen, I don't see any real reason for you to not simply 
handling them manually.
