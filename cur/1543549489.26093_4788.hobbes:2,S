Hmm.. 
The legacy side should still work. The fact that it isn't routed to the
IO-APIC probably means that it is routed directly to the legacy stuff,
like the timer normally is.

I have this suspicion that the correct interrupt mapping would be found in
the MP table.
The same way PCI interrupts get mapped by the MP table to their "real"
mapping, any other irq numbers probably should too - we've mapped the
legacy irq 5 away to another interrupt, and nobody told ISA-PnP, so irq 5
is probably _really_ somewhere on irq 18 or similar with the IO-APIC
enabled.

The irq is still there, it's just that it's mapped somewhere else. The MP
table should give the mapping. 
Please find the "mptable" program, and run it. If you don't already have
it on your system, search for it on google or something.. It will print
out your whole MP table, and that might give a better clue about where irq
5 has gone, and what we should do inside the ISA PnP code to find the
right irq..
