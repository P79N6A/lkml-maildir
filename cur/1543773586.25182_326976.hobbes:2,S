Hello!
Isn't that a kind of absurd comparison: rdtsc is one or two instructions, while 
gettimeofday is a complete syscall with some many instructions: rdtsc will never 
give you the time of day besides of that. Are you voting for replacing 
gettimeofday with rdtsc?

You can either have it accurate, or you can have it fast. Also gettimeofday works 
on any UNIX platform, rdtsc does not.

Good point, but you don't get that higher reliability and accuracy for free.

In which applications (Java excepted maybe) do you really need to call 
gettimeofday more than a few thousand times per second? Most likely you are 
working around a different issue then.
