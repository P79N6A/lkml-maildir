I wonder if there are any known problems with automount and kernel
2.2.12?
I have box where most of the user accounts are accessed via automount,
and now when trying to login to any of the user accoutns the telnet
(or whatever) will just hang waiting for the mound to finish.
Uptime 12 days.
I have one automount in DW state. And several in.rhsd, in.rlogind
processes in D state.
