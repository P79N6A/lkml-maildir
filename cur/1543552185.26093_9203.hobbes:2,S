Ah, but I do find cases where we would get ENOSPC.
So, the following patch, anticipated by you, fixes this.
diff -u --recursive --new-file ../linux-2.4.0test9/linux/fs/ext2/namei.c ./linux/fs/ext2/namei.c

[if one is very cautious,
	return err ? err : -EIO
would be safest, but I believe that all paths leading here
in fact do set err]
