This is debatable.  Windows does something like this.  It really annoys
me that I will get a windows desktop very quickly after logging in
but that I can't do anything with it until some mystrey initialization
takes place.  I would hate to be able to log into my linux machine but
not be able to check email for the first 15 seconds.
