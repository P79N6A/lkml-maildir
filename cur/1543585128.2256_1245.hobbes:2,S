My guess is, ILLEGAL REQUEST is caused by the sr driver issuing
"Mechanism Status" (0xbd) command to the CDROM drives sr0, sr1, sr2, sr3
and sr4. The reason sr driver is issuing this command is because the
loading mechanism type field in CD-ROM capabilities page is set to 0x4
(changer). Does the Nakamichi drive put the changer mechanism on a
separate LUN, e.g. 1? If so, maybe the "Mechanism Status" commnad should
go to LUN 1 but cdrom_read_mech_status() does not set the LUN field in
cgc.cmd[1] to any value other than 0. Could this be the reason for
ILLEGAL REQUEST?
