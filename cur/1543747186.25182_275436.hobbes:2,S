Sorry, a word "stable" was not appropriate. I meant that kexec-dump was
under development yet. kexec-dump works well on i386/x86_64, but it is
in the development stage on other architectures.

diskdump is almost completed. I think it is more efficient to enhance 
quality of diskdump than help kexec-dump.
