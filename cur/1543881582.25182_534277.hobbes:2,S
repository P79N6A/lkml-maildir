I didn't say I necessarily agreed that this was a good idea.  I just meant that
I agree that it will waste CPU.  You must still audit all uses of
cancel_delayed_work().

Because calling schedule_delayed_work() is a waste of CPU if the timer expiry
handler is currently running at this time as *that* is going to also schedule
the delayed work item.

Yes, but that's not the point.

I don't see what you're illustrating here.  Are these meant to be two steps in
a single process?  Or are they two alternate steps?

It permits us to avoid the test_and_set_bit() under some circumstances.

Ah, but the timer routine may try to set the work item pending flag *after* the
work_pending() check you have here.  Furthermore, it would be better to avoid
the work_pending() check entirely because that check involves interacting with
atomic ops done on other CPUs.  try_to_del_timer_sync() returning -1 tells us
without a shadow of a doubt that the work item is either scheduled now or will
be scheduled very shortly, thus allowing us to avoid having to do it ourself.
