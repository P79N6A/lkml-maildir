I don't know the answer to (a).  I don't even recall what caused it
to be dropped from -mm a few months ago, but I should look that up,
or if anyone recalls, please refresh my memory.
Unless 2.6 is much different from past kernel versions, new features
can be added after 2.6.0-final is out, usually if they are well-contained,
like a new driver or filesystem.  I don't see this as a big hurdle.
