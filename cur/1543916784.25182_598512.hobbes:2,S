heh. Evil plan to enable the group scheduler by default worked out as 
planned! ;-) [guess how many container users would do ... interactivity 
tests like you do??]

'very very nice' == 'best ever' ? :-)

ok, i'm too seeing some sort of latency weirdness with 
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED enabled, _if_ there's Xorg involved which runs 
under root uid on my box - and hence gets 50% of all CPU time.
Srivatsa, any ideas? It could either be an accounting buglet (less 
likely, seems like the group scheduling bits stick to the 50% splitup 
nicely), or a preemption buglet. One potential preemption buglet would 
be for the group scheduler to not properly preempt a running task when a 
task from another uid is woken?
