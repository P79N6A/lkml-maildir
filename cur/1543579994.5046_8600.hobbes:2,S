Hi Jens,
I've tested your patch quite as heavy as it gets: I created 5 files of each 
100 MB, set up 5 loop devices and made a RAID5 array out of them, putting 
ext2 on it and running a bonnie loop with 350 MB test size over it for the 
night.
Everything survived, worked flawlessly and I'm happy my disk did too :-)
Many thanks for the fine work!
Greetings,
Andreas
