Changing the algorithm from gzip is going to be probably unpopular.
Cloop uses the gzip deflate library inside the kernel shared by a
large number of other programs.  To change the algorithm you'll have
to add more (private) decompression code to the kernel.  This is a retrograde
step because the shared library was only introduced in 2.4.17 to avoid lots
of private copies of gzip.

There has been discussion on this list before about adding
bzip2 support to the kernel.  Do a search on the list for this.
