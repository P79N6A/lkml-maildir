I suspect there are hundreds or thousands of ways on such a big system to 
exploit some lock to make the system unresponsive.  If you wanted
to fix them all your would be in a large scale redesign effort. 
It's not clear why this particular case is special.

At least in traditional signal semantics you have to call sigaction
or signal in each signal handler to reset the signal. So that 
assumption is not necessarily true.

Taking all these locks without risking deadlock would be tricky.
You could just use a ring, but would need to point to a common
anchor and always start from there to make sure all lock grabbers
aquire the locks in the same order.

How about you figure out a fast path of some signals that can work
without locking: e.g. no load balancing needed, no queued signal, etc. 
and then just do the delivery of SIGPROF lockless? Or just ignore it
since the original premise doesn't seem to useful.
