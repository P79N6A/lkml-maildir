I thought that journaling filesystems happen to overwrite exactly the same
place (where the journal is) many times... Am I mistaken?
So the effect is what we had for floppies (some many years ago) where sector
0 and others where FAT structure was kept were overused and start giving
errors - so the only solution was to throw away that floppy.
Hard disks had the same problem, but they have algorithms to relocate bad
clusters.
So do these "leveling algorithms" refer to the same? Relocating bad cells?
If not, you can see how a journaling system can fry a CF card quickly.

3x10^18 is a bit overstating, IMHO. Don't have a reference now.
