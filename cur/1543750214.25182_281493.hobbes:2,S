Here's my small contribution.  I did three "make -j3 vmlinux" timed
runs, one running a kernel without the pre-zeroing stuff applied,
one with it applied.  It did shave a few seconds off the build
consistently.  Here is the before:
real	8m35.248s
user	15m54.132s
sys	1m1.098s
real	8m32.202s
user	15m54.329s
sys	1m0.229s
real	8m31.932s
user	15m54.160s
sys	1m0.245s
and here is the after:
real	8m29.375s
user	15m43.296s
sys	0m59.549s
real	8m28.213s
user	15m39.819s
sys	0m58.790s
real	8m26.140s
user	15m44.145s
sys	0m58.872s
