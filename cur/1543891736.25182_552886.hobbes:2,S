Pathnames are only used for informational purposes in the kernel, except in 
AppArmor of course. /proc only uses pathnames in a few places, 
but /proc/mounts will silently fail and produce garbage entries. That's not 
ideal of course; we should fix that somehow.
Note that this has nothing to do with the AppArmor discussion ...

Dream on. Redefining fundamental vfs semantics is not an option; we should 
rather make sure that we fail gracefully. Considering the alternatives, I 
still prefer the configurable limit. That's way more useful than allowing a 
process to DOS the kernel with AppArmor.
