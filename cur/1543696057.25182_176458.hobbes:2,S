Why?
The reason we test the PSE bit is not that we think it's a good indicator 
of "new enough".  It's because if the PSE bit is set, we will use 4MB 
pages, and the code below that actually _tests_ whether WP works or not 
won't work.
So it doesn't _matter_ that

do not have PSE, they'll just end up testing dynamically if it works or 
not.
In fact, these days we could remove the test entirely: the only reason it 
exists is because traditionally we didn't have the "fixmap" helpers, so we 
used the page in lowest kernel memory for testing (which did not exist if 
we had PSE, since with PSE the kernel wouldn't use individual pages to map 
itself).
