I have been thinking about this problem for a while tonight, the crux of
the problem is that I now have a 400MB partition that is going to be nuked
pretty soon (thank you, VMware 8). The thing is, I would like to add this
extra free space to my /home partition. Normally, I'd just tar (using bru
for integrity reasons) the /home partition's contents to my /archive
partition on my 2nd hard disk, nuke the /home partition along with the
newly freed up partition and then create a new /home partition.
Unfortunately, perhaps because I didn't think about it enough in the first
place, it's not that easy.
My mass storage system is made up of the following
/dev/hda (6.4GB hard disk)
contains
/dev/hda1             1       13   104391   16  Unknown
/dev/hda2            14       64   409657+  16  Unknown
/dev/hda3   *        65      319  2048287+  83  Linux native
/dev/hda4           320      826  4072477+   5  Extended
/dev/hda5           320      811  3951958+  83  Linux native
/dev/hda6           812      826   120456   82  Linux swap
As you can see, it's a problem[1] =) It is now apparent to me that the
answer to the problem is an utility that can be booted off a floppy (maybe
contains a Linux kernel & an init that loads the utility). This utility
could then allow the user to do:
1) Moving partitions 
2) Resizing partitions
With such a utility, it would then be immediately obvious to me that all I
have to do is a) move the /dev/hda3 partition into the space left by
nuking /dev/hda2. (It goes without saying that LILO would need to be rerun
to note the new positions) b) move the entire extended partition into the
space left by the moved /dev/hda3 partition. c) resize the extended
partition so it takes up all the free space towards the end of the media
d) Move the /dev/hda6 swap partition *back* to the end. e) Finally, resize
the /dev/hda5 partition so it takes up all the free space. 
And that's it. Has anyone got plans to implement such a utility in the
near future? 
[1] I know I could just back it all up onto tape and restore but my tape
drive is broken 8(
