The make it difficult if not effectively impossible to separate the two,
claiming that therefore they are not under the restrictions of the GPL.
However, the GPL _clearly_ states that if it is distributed as a single
work, then all parts _must_ be distributable under the terms of the
GPL.  I believe that a single binary firmware image is a single "work"
according to the definition provided in the GPL, and therefore by
distributing their code as a part of it, they have implicitly applied 
the
GPL to said work (assuming it was not GPLed already for other
reasons).
