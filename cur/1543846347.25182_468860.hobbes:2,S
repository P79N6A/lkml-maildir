I'm afraid not; it looks like my suggestion "LCD display" grates on
people's ears. Simply calling the device an "LCD" is probably the
best bet, and "LCD screen" would be better than "LCD monitor". Screens
can be any size, it's a fairly generic term.
The class name and directory name should probably include the word
"display", but I don't know what the other part should be. What sort
of displays should be included in this category, and what sort
shouldn't?
