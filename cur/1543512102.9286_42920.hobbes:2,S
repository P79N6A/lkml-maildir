Is this sarcasm? Or are you being sarcastic about my sarcasm? ;-)
I know /dev/sound is not enough to properly manipulate sound hardware. But
manipulating hardware via special files has become "The UNIX Way", my point
is how is the current /dev system different from /proc which you obviously
dislike.

Well applications use both of these. With other operating systems (like
Windows) you get devices without abstraction, and have a different library
and different API for manipulating every single one of them.

real file space. or were you being sarcastic?

Difference is, Windows actually supports dynamic adding and removing of
devices. So in this example, I would disagree with your sarcasm that they
were better, because in fact they are better. Users don't want to plug in
their printer and make character device files in order to be able to access
it. Especially when the numbers make no sense at all. Or at least, make
varying degrees of sense to how much you hang around the person who invented
the numbering scheme.
By the way, if you have a personal email account, I would appreciate it. You
seem to be posting from 'root@various places'. If this  is going to turn
into a sarcasm war rather than work on finding a solution to the problem at
hand, I would prefer not to involve two mailing lists.
