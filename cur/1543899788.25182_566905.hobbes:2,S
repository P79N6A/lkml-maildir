Subject: [PATCH 010 of 20] knfsd: nfsd: factor nfsd_lookup into 2 pieces
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/9/473

From: J. Bruce Fields <bfields@citi.umich.edu>
Factor nfsd_lookup into nfsd_lookup_dentry, which finds the right dentry
and export, and a second part which composes the filehandle (and which
will later check the security flavor on the new export).
No change in behavior.
