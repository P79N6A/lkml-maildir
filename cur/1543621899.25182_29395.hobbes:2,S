I get this on every cd I try and I've tried more than I'd have liked to.
Performing OPC...

Now I know every cd isn't bad because they used to work in older
2.4.17ish kernels.  I have scsi-generic support compiled as a module as
well as ide-scsi.  This is what the kernel detects the drive as
SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
  Vendor: CREATIVE  Model:  CD-RW RW8438E    Rev: FC03
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
That is correct.  This is what hdparm tells about the drive 
/dev/hdc:
 HDIO_GET_MULTCOUNT failed: Input/output error
 I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 HDIO_GET_NOWERR failed: Input/output error
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 BLKRAGET failed: Input/output error
 HDIO_GETGEO failed: Invalid argument
 busstate     =  1 (on)
not sure what else I can get informationwize about what the drive is
doing.
