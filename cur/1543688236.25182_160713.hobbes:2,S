How do you intend to deal with the childs of the device that has
pm_users non null ?
If you don't suspend it, you must also postpone all of it's childs.
That makes the list walking slightly more tricky, or you finally go
to a real tree structure ? (Which you may have to do to implement
the set_parent() thing too, no ?
