Yeah, but how is that relevant to the fact, that after
path_release_*() _nothing_ will be valid in the nameidata, not
nd->mnt, not nd->dentry, and not nd->intent.open.file.  So what's the
point in setting it to NULL if it must never be used anyway?

That's why I doubted that this is an issue.

No, it's being opened for read.  The namei_flags (and hence
intent.open.flags) will have FMODE_WRITE, so that the permission is
checked for write.
So I thing the bug is not in the calculation of namei_flags, rather
the fact that intent.open.flags is set to namei_flags, rather than the
original open flags.
