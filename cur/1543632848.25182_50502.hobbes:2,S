What parts of the filesystem needs to be accessed very often? I think, that placing var on a ramdisk, that is mirrored on the hd and is synced every 30 minutes, would be a good solution.
I think, that we should add a sysrq key to save the ramdisk to the disk. Is there a similar project, that loads an image into a ramdisk at mount, and writes it back at unmount?
