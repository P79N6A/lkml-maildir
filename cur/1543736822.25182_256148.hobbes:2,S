oh? you mean that 1Mb gap between stack and topdown? Every ISV I talked to
said they could get more VA space with topdown than with the suse
mmaped_base hack... :)

MAP_FIXED is to be used only on things YOU mmaped before.

wrong; brk() is there which is also used by malloc() and internally by the C
library.

do you have proof for that?

You missed that you can only use MAP_FIXED on mmaps YOU mmaped before.
That's true for basically all operating systems because the runtime
(including C library) is allowed to malloc, to brk(), to mmap etc etc.
