Its normally impossible to trip the extra letters. There are exceptions and
ways to get longer strings you want echoed back to their modem. I'm 
certainly not going to explain how you do that here but suffice to say
you can do stuff like + + + ATD <your 911 expensive number> to people. 
It is important people take the guard band problems seriously.
