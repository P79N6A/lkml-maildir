The best way I can think to do that is take a look at /proc/slabinfo.  That will
likely give you a pointer to which area of code is eating up your memory.

Based on the sysrq-m info you posted it looks like due to fragmentation the
largest chunk of memory you can allocate is 2MB (perhaps less depending on
address space availability).  If you can build a test kernel to do a show_state
rather than a show_mem at the beginning of oom_kil, then you should be able to
tell who is trying to do an allocation that leads to kswapd calling
out_of_memory.
