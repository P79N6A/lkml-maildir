Easiest is probably doing diff between 2.4.21-pre4 and 2.4.20, and
then taking only changes in include/linux/matroxfb.h,
drivers/video/matrox and drivers/video/Config.in... Though I'm
not sure why you just do not upgrade to 2.4.21-pre4.
You can find older version of these changes at 
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest,
 but please note
that 2.4.21-pre4 is more uptodate than 2.4.x patches at the URL
above. 2.5.59 patch at URL above is uptodate, but it is not going to
the kernel, because it is incompatible with other fbdev drivers.
