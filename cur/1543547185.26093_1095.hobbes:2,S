even reading from certaing ioremap'd areas is dangerous. (ok current
/proc/kcore prevents that from happening by skipping such).

speaking of /dev/kmem, I always wondered why Alan Cox (or someone
else?) objected to adding vwrite() ability to write to vmalloc'd addresses
via /dev/kmem and this discussion is as good as any to ask here :)
I.e. it is kind of assymetric to allow reading (via vread()) and disallow
writing. I have a patch (by Amit Kale) that adds this support.
