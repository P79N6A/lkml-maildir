There is another problem. The kernel requires a procedural language
to communicate with hardware. Interface with hardware is all about
the step-by-step methods necessary to make hardware run. C++ tries
to isolate one from the actual methods involved. That's what it
was designed for.
One would need to use "extensions" just to get text to the screen.
'C' being an "smart" assembler, is nearly ideal for kernel
development.
