This would be a bit bad, because it would require people to guess whether they 
might have a card that parport_serial can drive and/or try loading the module 
to see what happens.
I guess one option would be for parport_pc to somehow "know" what cards are 
really multi-I/O ones, and only load parport_serial when it will be able to 
find something to do.  Doesn't seem all that appealing though.

If you do that then the code will effectively be there all the time, even when 
it's not needed.  You might as well just compile it in to parport_pc.  To be 
honest, there isn't all that much of it so maybe this wouldn't be such a bad 
idea.
