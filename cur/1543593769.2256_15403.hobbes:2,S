	Well, but can you see the hole from the user-space daemon?

	Yes, of course. But this is an implementation detail of cachefsd.

	Well, let's speak about NFS, locally cached on ext2. The present
implemetation takes inode number from NFS, and creates and ext2 file
named - for example - /cache/%d (for file contents) and  /cache/%d.attr for
stat(2) data and valid blocks bitmap. The %d is an inode number from the
NFS volume.
