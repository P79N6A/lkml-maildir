Hi,
We've got a Dell Poweredge 4300 server, with 512MB RAM, serving Samba,
IMAP, Sendmail, DNS, Web, Sendmail, POP3, for 100 users+ on a Local Area
Network that has some internet connectivity.  It's currently running
2.2.5, and we've tested this with both an etherexpress pro 100, and a
tulip board.  We're getting the same types of problems, with both network
boards.
When the load is small, we have no problems with the network.
During the day, when there is a lot of Samba access, along with IMAP
(these processes take up a lot of CPU and network bandwidth), we get
instances from certain PC's, randomly, where there is no longer any
connectivity to the server.  We can't ping the server, and from the
server, we can't ping the workstation.  A ping flood on either of them
sometimes fixes the problem.  This has gotten to be a pretty big problem,
since this seems to happen rather randomly to certain workstations.  It's
not just ping that's not available, it's everything on the server.  It
just disappears off the network for a few minutes, then comes back, and
only for that specific workstation.
What kind of network tools can we use to troubleshoot this, and what kind
of information should I get available if it turns out to be a problem with
Linux?
Thanks,
Ben
