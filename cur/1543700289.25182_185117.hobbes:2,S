Subject: [PATCH] Remove use of nameidata by selinux_inode_permission
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/12/19/106

This patch against 2.6.0 removes the use of nameidata by
selinux_inode_permission, as this appears to be unsafe in certain cases
(e.g. path_walk call from rpc_lookup_parent), leading to an Oops if
d_path is subsequently called by avc_audit on the (mnt,dentry) pair to
generate a pathname for an audit message.  The change does not affect
the ability of SELinux to perform its permission check (which only
requires the inode), only the set of information that is available for
audit messages.  We'll investigate better approaches for the SELinux
audit generation in the future.  Please apply, or let me know if you
would like me to resubmit later.
