Hey all..I realize that this is an offtopic post and I apologize but since
there are so many kernel experts on here and the data that I've found on
the web all seems to deal with older kernels I didn't know who else to
turn to...
I'm trying to pull the data off an IBM Model 70 386 machine that has only
2944K of RAM and an ESDI hd. To make matters even more interesting the
machine is running
Xenix and is using a UFS file system. The topper is that I need to put the
data onto my parallel EPAT hd :-)
I'm looking for resources on how to make a VERY tight root/boot disk that
will allow me to do all this. I'm very familiar with making kernels and
using EPAT as a module etc etc. I'm just hoping that somebody has done
something similar so I don't have to try and reinvent the wheel. I've been
to the Linux MCA web site which has good but outdated info.
Anybody know of any resources or someone I could talk to for help?
Thanks!
Chris
