Or you just define must_inline, and let gcc inline the rest of 'inlines',
based on its own rule of functions size, adjusting the parameters
to gcc to assure (more or less) that what is inlined fits in cache of
the processor one is building for...
(this can be hard, help from gcc hackers will be needed...)
