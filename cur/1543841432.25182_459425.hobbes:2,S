It's been floating around for ages; we want it to become *old*, showing a
decreasing rate of change.

Trond merged the large nfs-affecting ones; I don't know if he intends to
handle the non-nfs bulk of the work though.
I doesn't matter, really - I'll frequently carry features with a plan to
send them into a subsystem tree.  Or Trond could duck it and I can send the
patches direct to Linus after git-nfs has merged.
Either way, the patches which are presently in -mm are "in the pipeline" -
they're the ones which people are testing (for compile, at least) and
reviewing (hah).  If we decide to send them into Trond then I'll add them
to my things-to-spam-maintainers-with pile.
Your CONFIG_BLOCK patches did a decent job of trashing your
fs-cache-make-kafs-* patches, btw.  What's up with that?  OK, it's sensible
for people to work against mainline but the net effect of doing that is to
create a mess for other people to clean up.

These patches are quite large and complex.  Frankly, I doubt if Trond or
Christoph have the bandwidth to review them.  It would be excellent if they
were able to, but...
We have a large coder-versus-reviewer imbalance, especially in the
filesystems area.  cf reiser4.

If Christoph acks them then I can send them to Trond or Linus, at Trond's
option.
Or I can butt out, drop the patches, wait for them to turn up in Trond's
tree, at your option.
