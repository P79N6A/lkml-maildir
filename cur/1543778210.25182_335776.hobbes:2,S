[PATCH NFS 0/3] Cleanup/fix nfs_block_size() and nfs_block_bits()
The Plan 9 filesystem for Linux had some code which wrongly calculated
the size of blocks.  A comment said this code has been taken from NFS.
Patch 3 of this series contains a fix for the bug, the first two patches
are preparation work and shouldn't change the results.  I didn't went so
far and actually test the patch, so please be careful. =)  Compiles fine
here, at least.
