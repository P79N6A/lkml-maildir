Actually, we may want that for other reasons anyway. In particular, I can
well imagine why a networked filesystem in particular might want to
invalidate a range of a file cache, but not necessarily all of it.
(Yeah, I don't know of any network filesystem that does invalidation on
anything but a file granularity, but I assume such filesystems have to
exist. Especially in cluster environments it sounds like a sane thing to
do invalidates on a finer granularity)
