ah, good. Feel free to include such information in future patches. I've 
applied your patch to tip/x86/cleanups, thanks! See below how the final 
commit looks like - added the sparse warning as well.

Subject: [PATCH] x86: process.c declare c1e_remove_cpu before they get used
Impact: cleanup, avoid sparse warning
Included asm/idle.h for c1e_remove_cpu() declaration. Fixes this
sparse warning:
  CHECK   arch/x86/kernel/process.c
  arch/x86/kernel/process.c:284:6: warning: symbol 'c1e_remove_cpu' was not declared. Should it be static?
