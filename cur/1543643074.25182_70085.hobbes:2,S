In the mid-level mp patch the adapters are not aware of multi-path. The
changes to adapters carried in the patch have to do with a driver not
allowing aborts during link down cases or iterating over the host_queue
for ioctl, /proc reasons. The hiding of some of the lists behind APIs is
something I had to do in the host list cleanup. We might even do some of
this same list cleanup outside of mp.
Also add "my me to" on the scsi error handling is lacking statement. I
am currently trying to do something about not using the failed command
for error recovery (post abort).
