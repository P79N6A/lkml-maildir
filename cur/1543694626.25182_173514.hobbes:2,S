Hello Pavel, hello Patrick, hi folks,
The saga ([0] and [1]) continues, here are the latest facts about ACPI S3
suspend to ram mode with the Acer TravelMate 800LCi notebook.
With Linux 2.6.0-test8, there is some kind of partial success: After doing
"echo -n mem > /sys/power/state" the box suspends and after pressing a key
on the keyboard the box resumes. The box reacts to input afterwards, for
example one can do "reboot" as root and even pressing the power key does
what it is supposed to do. Unfortunately there is one big disadvantage:
The panel of the notebook stays completely black. I tried booting with
"acpi_sleep=s3_{mode,boot}" but in both cases, the box apparently hangs
while trying to resume (no [blind] keyboard input possible, pressing the
power button has no effect)
Any ideas where the problem might be and if so how to fix it?
