Hi,
We have multiple instances of the same executable running on our system.
Do these instances share the text segment or are there multiple copies
of the text segment(one for each process) ? Note that I am not talking
about the shared libraries.
I note that do_exec calls do_mmap to map the executable file to memory.
But not sure what happens(w.r.t text sharing) when another instance of 
the program is invoked. BTW, this is 2.6.10.
Thanks,
Ravi
