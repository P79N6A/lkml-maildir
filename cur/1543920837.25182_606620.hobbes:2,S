His request is off-topic, and "post" would be a violation, but he is 
allowed a personal copy under "fair use" doctrine unless the law has 
changed recently.
US copyright is unique, things on which copyright has expired were 
re-protected when the law changed, making copying which was legal when 
done a crime after the fact. I'm not sure British law using 400 year old 
precedents is better, just more predictable.
