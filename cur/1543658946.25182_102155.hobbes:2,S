    Programming environment. 
There is a lot more to a system than the kernel and programming
environment.  Consider GNOME or KDE, Mutt, Mozilla, OpenOffice, and
GNU Chess.  They are not part of the programming environment.
			     I say "Gnu tools" .
Some GNU packages are tools, but most of them are not.  If you want to
talk specifically about the GNU packages that are tools, could you please
take care with the wording so that readers won't assume it means
that all GNU packages are tools?
