Same here.

I'm using two seagates (different models), one Samsung and one Maxtor, this
happens in all 4.
I'm not using any kind of RAID.

If the filesystems are mounted read only it seems to run stable (even though
I do see those errors)....if I mount r/w, any write is likely to make the
system crash rather soon.

No, to be honest I didn't even think of this. You think it could make a
difference? Given the fact that the card works correctly with the HPT
drivers, pretty much everything that does not relate directly to the IDE
drivers seems ruled out as the cause...
