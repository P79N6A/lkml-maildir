I've been maintaining a patchset for internal use on and off
for a while, and have decided to publish it externally. It's 
based on 2.5.47 partly because I'm slow and boring, but also
because I don't particularly want anything from 49, and there's
some bleeding edge stuff in it I'd rather not cut myself on.
The patchset contains mainly scalability and NUMA stuff, and 
anything else that stops things from irritating me. It's meant 
to be pretty stable, not so much a testing ground for new stuff.
I'd be very interested in feedback from other people running 
large SMP or NUMA boxes.
Next additions will probably be timer fixes, moving NUMA-Q to
subarch, Summit support, and shared pagetables.
