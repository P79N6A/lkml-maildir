atached is my kernel config...
this was discovered while I was troubleshooting a new rc.modules script
to be more flexable than the one that comes with slakware...
ok here is the test that *WAS* repeatable...issue the following command
2 times in a row to compealtly remove all modules and a Segment fault
comes up as follows...
# for i in `cat /proc/modules | cut -f1 -d" "` ; do rmmod $i; done
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address c2879560

system is slakware 7.0
Intel Pentium MMX 200
32 meg ram
(unsure if this is relivant)
98meg swap partition on hda3
16meg swap partition on hdb2
modutils-2.3.9
egcs-2.91.66
...
all other software on system conforms to requirements listed in Changes
file
I believe the problem is in the parport_pc module...
