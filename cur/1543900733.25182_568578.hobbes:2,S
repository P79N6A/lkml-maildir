The worst case would most likely be in a dm multipath configuration where
you could get a burst of N number events (N being equal to the number of
luns times the number of paths that are having an issue).

Yes, the ones that are part of this patch are unexpected events or
recovery of the unexpected event.

I was using GFP_ATOMIC as I did not want __GFP_IO as in some testing there
was a case where heavy file system IO was going on and an injected error
event caused the swap device into a temporary queued condition while an
event was trying to be sent. I may need to go back and investigate this
case on recent kernels as it has been a while since I did the test case.
