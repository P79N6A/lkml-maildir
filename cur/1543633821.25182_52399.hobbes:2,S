Mine were removed, and does this count for "sarcastic response".
I am happy not to be in 2.5.
But in a serious note "linux 2.4.19-preX" is a very lose term.
Unless otherwise noted, only Alan Cox has been adopting code as a shake
down before it goes to Marcelo.  So if these are straight 2.4.19-preX
kernels, I have not sent anything to Marcelo for offical inclusion.
If these are 2.4.19-preX-acX that is a different story.
And yes, maybe I have lost the joy of public kernel development.
Then again, I do not have anyone giving me a cakewalk employment package
to just write code for kicks now.  The net result is vendors who have an
interest in customer based support are seeking to offer direct support to
get direct support.
