This code looks right. 
We see an 810E_0 (host bridge)
We look for an 810E_1 secondary 
If we dont find it we abort
So the question I guess is what do you hav and why didnt it find it
8086 7124, 8086 7125 is the intel 810E GMCH and 810E CGC
Which of the checks fail - and also did you remember to include 810 support
in your agp options ?
