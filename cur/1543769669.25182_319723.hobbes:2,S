Subject: [OT] Joerg Schilling flames Linux on his Blog

As everyone knows, Joerg Schilling has a blog, and he often pushes his 
pro-Solaris agenda, and flames the LKML about how Linux breaks cdrecord 
(instead of just admitting cdrecord is broken) or how much more awesome 
Solaris is compared to Linux.
Well, he just fired yet another salvo at the Linux community: 
http://schily.blogspot.com/2005/04/value-marketing-and-freedom.html
I commented on his blog entry, but I am afraid of being censored as my views 
do not align with his, so I am including the text of my comment here:
////
I suggest people don't read too much into what Schily says. He thinks Solaris 
is this almighty perfect operating system that crushes all others: The reason 
Solaris is failing is because more and more people are switching to other 
operating systems. And yes, Linux just happens to be the one that most are 
switching to; BSD and QNX are also other choices.
Most of the people switching to Linux are not doing so because its GPL, not 
because its associated with other Free Software, and not because the source 
is available. They are switching simply because it is the best product out 
there at this time; and as I see it, it will continue to be the best product 
because Linux software developers are not sitting around arguing about what 
license is better, or what features other operating systems have or don't 
have.
Linux developers code, OpenSolaris developers sit around and flame Linux 
developers instead of coding. Which operating system would _you_ choose?
