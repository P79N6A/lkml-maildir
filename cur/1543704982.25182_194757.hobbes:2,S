But wouldn't it be painfully slow?

Have you ever used a graphics card in VESA mode?  Dragging a window 
around the screen and watching it repaint can be a very unenjoyable 
thing to watch.  From what you've described, this is the sort of thing 
you'd get.

Interfacing with the PCI bus is easy enough in an FPGA.  If all you want 
is a dumb framebuffer, you can fit that logic into a very small, 
inexpensive Xilinx part.  All you need is a DAC and some memory chips, 
and you're set.
But even PCI can be very slow, particularly for image loads.

Ok, so, how about this idea:
- Small Xilinx FPGA, 16M of RAM, and a DAC on a board.
- AGP 2X
- Up to 2048x2048 resolution at 8, 16, and 32 bpp.
- Acceleration ONLY for solid fills and bitblts on-screen.
Given that so little is accelerated, there is no point in putting more 
than the viewable framebuffer on the card, hense the 16 megs.  It would 
probably actually HURT performance to cache pixmaps on the card.
Oh, there's one thing I forgot.  It would have to support VGA.  There is 
a VGA core on opencores.org that we could use, but its logic area would 
probably push up the FPGA cost so that the board was in the $100 range. 
  Probably more.
<sigh>
