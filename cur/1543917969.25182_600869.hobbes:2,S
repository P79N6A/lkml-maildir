Hi Ralf,
Thanks for the reply.
Is there any problem if we use the below API's in
linxu-2.6.18 
  - dma_cache_wback_inv()
  - dma_cache_wback()
  - dma_cache_inv()
functionality wise, especially in r4k.c i dont see any
difference between the implementation of these APIs.
Can we apply the 2.6.24 patch to kill these APIs on
2.6.18 kernel? In this case what APIs i can use for
writeback, invalidation or both?
I couldn't find any info. related to the above API in
DMA-API.txt. Could you please give some pointers on
the usage/working of these APIs.
Regards,
Veerasena.
