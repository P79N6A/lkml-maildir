So? You want it to lock up the machine?
Alan, what _are_ you arguing about? That "disable_irq()" is absolutely 
rquired, because:
 - not having it locks up the machine if the irq happens to be level.
 - not having it means that the "enable_irq()" that happens when the irq 
   is reported to user space is unbalanced.

Did you actually test the code? Did you ever _look_ at it?
