Can't think of a lot really.
Are you sure that fsck is only running journal recovery?  Is it possible that
it is performing a full fsck for some reason?
Make sure you're running current e2fsprogs?
Boot with `init=/bin/sh', run fsck by hand in the background, poke around
with `ps' to see what it's up to, etc.
