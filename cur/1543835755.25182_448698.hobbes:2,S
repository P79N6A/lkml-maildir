And WMFS does not belong to the WolfMountainGroup any longer.  It has 
been acquired by another company, so you won't see any info
about it on the website.  It's has been rolled into another company.  I 
can bundle it with appliances but it is no longer the property of
Wolf Mountain Group.  WMG is a MediaWiki/Wikipedia Appliance company 
that does Machine translations of Wikipedia into several
Native American Languages.  The Translator is Linux and Windows based, 
but WMFS has a new home now. 
Just to clarify.
