That's exactly what started this search, because I was running
"make deb-pkg". (Effectively.)  dpkg-buildpackage wants to think it is
running as root, either via sudo or via fakeroot.  I had my build
environment switched over entirely to fakeroot, as it just seems to be a
better practice, but I've temporarily switched back to sudo.
However, your explanation has pointed out to me how I can solve this -
run "fakeroot -u" instead of "fakeroot", and I think it will be fixed.
lkml cc:ed to hopefully stick this in an archive where someone else will
find it.
