And when they join together they form a new entity, a new device. And that's
input system, not serio.

No need really. PCI devices are easily identifiable.

Strings are perfectly valid:
[dtor@core dtor]$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver
acpi-cpufreq
[dtor@core dtor]$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors
powersave userspace performance
It just depends on implementation.

Yes, I haven't wrapped my mind around it completely either. But we have
Greg K-H and others who will make sure we chose the right path ;)
