Aha - that's the stable documentation that I missed.  Thanks, Randy.
I figured that there was an explanation somewhere.  And there it is,
right in plain view.
Reading ...
My patch does pass the following criteria:
 - No "theoretical race condition" issues, unless an explanation of how
   the race can be exploited.
The conditions to trigger the race are too delicate to exploit
quickly.  I don't have a coded exploit.
Apparently I did the right thing by _not_ sending this patch to
stable@kernel.org <grin>.
This patch is dead.
