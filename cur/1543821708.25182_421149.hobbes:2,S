Dear diary, on Thu, May 04, 2006 at 10:14:54AM CEST, I got a letter
where Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> said that...

Oh, I expected this to end up in 1.3.2, actually. :-)
Shouldn't this belong to the maint branch? It is "physically" a new
feature but I would consider "cannot bisect kernel before January" a bug
certainly worth fixing and the feature is pretty tiny. (It seems to be
backwards-incompatible but that only means you should provide some
transition path, I think. ;)

Right now I am having amnesia and deja-vu at the same time.  I think
I have forgotten this before.
