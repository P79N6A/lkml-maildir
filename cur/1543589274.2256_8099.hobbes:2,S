Well, I also have such sound problem, but I don't use esd, neither a
sound card: only the output from my DVB-s card (and the bttv sound).
As everything related with sound on my system is as module, here the
output from lsmod (under 2.4.4-pre6 on which everything works just
perfectly, but the output is the same):
