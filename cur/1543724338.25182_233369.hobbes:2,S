I've noticed that on ext3, SQLite transactions are nearly useless, with the
smallest transactions causing 5 megabyte/s writout activity based on
relatively small writes. kjournald bore a large part of that according to
laptop_mode's block dump.
Do we actually need to flush the journal on fsync? I'm no fs theorist but I
wonder if having data in the journal isn't good enough - in case of failure,
the data will be there on recovery?
