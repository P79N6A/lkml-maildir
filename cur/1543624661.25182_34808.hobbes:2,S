Likewise.  Lets go over this again:
1) the idea is to have a hashing function that
   performs well for the page cache and/or the
   hashed wait queues
2) input for these two hash functions is not at
   all guaranteed to be random or uniformly spread
3) this means we need a hash function that performs
   well on very much non-random inputs
Now, where does your random number generator fit in this
scenario ?

Rik
