One concern I have with this approach is that it is for things for which
a need is _anticipated_, instead of things that are actually needed.  It
is awesome that this is being done in advance, but you have to be
careful not to throw the kitchen sink at the problem from the beginning.
Would a potential workload manager contact the individual Xen partitions
in order to get an overview of the entire machine?  Why would it not
simply contact the controlling partition?
