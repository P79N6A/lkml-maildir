Possibly. But that may be because most people don't have DEBUG_PREEMPT.

Hmm. _local_bh_enable() would make the preempt_count go negative or fall 
below 1 (with kernel lock held).

.. and it happens early on, when we take an interrupt in check_bugs.
Are we ready to enable interrupts there? Maybe the page fault we took (on 
purpose) enabled interrupts and we now take the irq much too early.
Or maybe the initial kernel lock didn't set preempt_count to 1.
Ingo, any ideas?
