Yes, I backported the core last week to 2.4.19-rc1 from 2.5.24, but the
patch ought to apply to 2.4.18 with only offset mismatches. I kept a lot
of style cleanups in the patch, but they should be easy to remove if
they cause problems. I'll be backporting the various napified drivers to
2.4 this week.
