Subject: nfsd bug: create file with specific uid/gid
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

nfsd/vfs.c:nfsd_create (the v2 version of create) says:
"Set file attributes. Mode has already been set and
setting uid/gid works only for root"
but it doesn't actually test for root-ness (which could happen if the 
access is no-root-squash). There's similar code without the comment in 
nfsd_create_v3. In both cases the test:
    if ((iap->ia_valid &= ~(ATTR_UID|ATTR_GID|ATTR_MODE)) != 0)
should read:
    if (current->fsuid != 0)
        iap->ia_valid &= ~(ATTR_UID|ATTR_GID);
    if ((iap->ia_valid &= ~ATTR_MODE) != 0)
although arguably they should return an EPERM error if the uid/gid bits 
are set, instead of silently ignoring them.
