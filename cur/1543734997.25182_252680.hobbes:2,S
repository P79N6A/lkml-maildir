Subject: [PATCH] build acpiphp modular and on i386/x86_64 [6/5]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/15/224

After the first five patches I sent, in order to build acpiphp on
i386/x86_64 or as a module on ia64, we need these exports and defines
currently.  I have a much better scheme in mind but it's not ready yet.
I promise I'll replace this with something much more portable.

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
