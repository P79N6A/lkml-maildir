Can you describe the pcmcia oops problem in detail?
What output do you get from a serial console?
what do you mean, oops got infinite trace?  were there (a) many oops or 
(b) one oops with long trace
what do you mean, double fix of /dev/XXXXX name?
is pcmcia-cs creating and removing /dev entries too?
