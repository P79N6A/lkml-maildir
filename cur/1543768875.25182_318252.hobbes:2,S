Correct.  The only bug reports we have seen related to the use of the
TSC is due to CPU frequency scaling.  The fix is to not use it - people
who want to use their PC as a DSP for audio probably don't want their
processor slowing down anyway.  And JACK is targeted at desktop and
smaller systems, it would be kind of crazy to run it on a big iron.
Well, maybe there are people who like to record sessions or practice
guitar in the server room...
If gettimeofday is really as cheap as rdtsc on x86_64, we should use it.
But it's too expensive for slower x86 systems.  Anyway, Andi's fix
disables *all* high res timing including gettimeofday.  Obviously no
multimedia app can tolerate this, so discussing rdtsc is really a red
herring.  But multimedia apps aren't much in seccomp environments
either.
