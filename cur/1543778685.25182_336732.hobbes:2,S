Well I don't know how awkward this would be from an implementation POV, but
can we just leave the legacy /proc stuff there until the /sys interface is
all in place and userspace is upgraded?  Then kill all the /proc stuff
later?
We could also print a rude message the first time someone tries to use a
deprecated /proc file, just to help push the userspace tool developers
along.  Although I note that sys_bdflush() is still with us ;)
