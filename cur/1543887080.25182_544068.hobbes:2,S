I think that one of the reasons people (guilty) don't report problems 
with suspend and hibernate is that it's been a problem on and off and 
when it breaks people don't bother to chase it, they just don't use it 
unless it's critical, or they install suspend2.
I only suggest that if 'platform' is more correct use that, don't change 
it again. Then fix platform.
