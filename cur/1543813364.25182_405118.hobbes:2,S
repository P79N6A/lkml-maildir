We're mapping some memory that the chip DMAs to into userspace, so that
user processes can spin on memory locations without going through the
kernel.  The SetPageReserved hack is an attempt to stop the VM from
reclaiming those pages from us once a user process exits.
I realise that it's surely bogus, and I'd be thrilled to do something
correct instead.  We've tried doing both SetPageReserved and get_page,
but it hasn't work out too well so far.
