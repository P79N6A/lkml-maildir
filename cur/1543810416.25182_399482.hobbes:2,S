Christoph,
Leaving the issues around the specific client aside here.
Any chance you could explain why some drivers in drivers/net use the
arch defines to set things like optimial burst sizes then?  Drivers
such as acenic.c, fealnx.c and starfire.c do this based on the arch
even though it really is a property of the combination of the PCI bus,
CPU and memory busses in the specific systems.
Were you planning on posting a patch to remove all of those instances
while you were at it?
Point is that there are cases where tuning requires you to know what
PCI bridge is below you in order to get the best performance out of a
card. One can keep a PCI ID blacklist to handle tuning of the PCI
bridge itself, but it can't handle things that needs to be tuned
by setting the PCI device's own registers.
Having a generic API to export this information would be a good thing
IMHO.
Cheers,
Jes
