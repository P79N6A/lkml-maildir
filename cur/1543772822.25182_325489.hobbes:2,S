Subject: is synchronize_net in inet_register_protosw necessary?

hi all.
i am a newbie to linux kernel.
in a arm926 board i found that it took about 30ms to finish
the (net/ipv4/af_inet.c:898) inet_register_protosw
because of the synchronize_net call during profiling.
synchronize_net finally calls synchronize_rcu, so i think
this is to make the change visiable after a list_add_rcu.
but according to the Document/listRCU.txt it seems that
a list insertation does not necessarily do call_rcu etc.
may i have any mistakes, please kindly tell me.
