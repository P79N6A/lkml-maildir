I wrote this down on my to-do list.  Its the sort of thing that 
evaporates from my consciousness when other things come along,
but I'll give it a shot.

Its not the reset, its the hot-plug remove.  The hot plug code assumes
that you are going to physically remove the device from the slot, so
it removes the device_node as part of the "unconfig".  
Of course, I found this out only after performing a null-pointer deref.
Note only does the node go away, but all of the various pointers it holds
are zeroed in the process.  
The cfg tree holds on to those pointers, so that I wouldn't have to
muck with the device_node removal code to do something tricky.

Yes, the reason is that after a reset, that property doesn't hold any 
decent data.   I discussed this with the firmware developers, and thier 
response was that it is the kernel's responsibility to compute 
(or save/restore) such values.  (Except for bridges, which they will do for us).

:)  Yes, well, indeed it is.  Don't look at me, not my idea.

Its a workqueue.

In principle, I'd agree. In practice, this would seem to require changes
or additions or enhancements to udev that I don't quite understand, as
well as potential changes to udev scripts.  Maybe I don't understand
sysfs sufficiently well.  I am very tempted to punt on this, and wait 
for the Intel-backed PCI-E code to get to this point, and then do whatever 
they're doing.
