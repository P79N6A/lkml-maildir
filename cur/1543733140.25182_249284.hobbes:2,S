Even KIOslave has  it. They even support sftp and  stuff just by using
shared files  in /tmp in reality.  That's a much  saner interface than
doing it all in the kernel.
I  mean,  the  kernel  is  supposed  to support  access  to  the  disk
drives. Who says that it's got  to be the uppermost VFS level? You can
be perfectly happy to build your own  VFS on top of it (or use other's
implementations, that is.)
I can  already see people moving  to FreeBSD if  this gets implemented
into the kernel...
