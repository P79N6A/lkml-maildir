I'm not necessarily advocating "capabilities light". I'm definately
advocating a "capabilities practical" scheme, which obviously includes
NFS and similar support.
But I'm not convinced that "capabilities practical" means
"capabilities light". If it does mean that, so be it. Mind you, I have
yet to see this proven.

I know. It's easy to flame or appear rude. Much harder to choose your
words so that you get the point across, including the intensity of
your belief, without coming across as arrogant, rude or flaming. We
all need to be vigilant. I certainly don't claim to be above it all.

Sure. But in your sticky+immutable scheme (or any variation), or in
fact a scheme where cap masks are kept in the FS metadata, the grant
and inherit masks require privilege to modify.

I've thought a little more about my scheme, and realised I had a
flaw. I've redesigned it to fix this. It also makes parts of my scheme
the same as yours, without the problems of yours, and with the extra
benefits of mine.
In addition, my scheme gives you a pretty flexible system for
increasing security on non-caps kernels. You can easily set things up
so that when root runs another binary, the uid and euid are set to
nobody, if that binary has no capability header, or doesn't have any
inheritable caps set. The only thing you can't control is statically
linked binaries without the magic code. But if you're setting up a
secure system, you'd relink those anyway.
Just as in your scheme, the kernel checks the magic flag (suid-root
for me, sticky+immutable for you). If that's not present, caps are
dropped, irrespective of the euid. If the magic flag is present, the
grant and inherit masks are applied.
At this point, for a caps-enabled kernel, our schemes are the same,
except that mine works over NFS and such.
Where things differ is that with my scheme, the capedit programme
inserts a small amount of magic code into a binary (if statically
linked), or into the dynamic linker (if dynamically linked), so that a
suid-root binary will fail (or change uid/euid) unless the ELF CAP
header has grant or inherit bits set. This code is only run on
cap-less kernels.
This does two things:
- it prevents the problem of luser running /bin/sh (which is suid-root
  so a cap-enabled kernel will allow inherits) and getting a root shell
- it provides *some* of the security benefits of file-based
  inheritance, so that any dynamically linked binary (or a new
  statically linked binary) can elect to drop root privileges.
For the non-caps kernel case, the magic code can be used to prevent
some/most/all binaries running as root.
And remember, just because you have all these suid-root binaries
floating around, it doesn't mean root can get cracked, or that you
have a root account.
I hope I've explained how my scheme works.

Indeed. If I decide I want to trust the fileserver to hand out
privileges, I want that flexibilty. Your scheme prevents that, because
it opens up a security hole (any luser can set the sticky bit, or you
require the immutable or some other non-Unix flag).
You're taking away that choice.
