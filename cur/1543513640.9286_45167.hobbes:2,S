Nope, I don't think there's new firmware just for Linux, unless someone's
previously reported this problem and they've revised the firmware to use less
memory. 
What they have on their web site, as far as I know, is a set of binary only
kernel drivers for the beast. 
Until recently, I was advising people to avoid the DiskOnChip at all costs, for
this reason. However, they've now provided me with complete specs for the
device, and I've got a GPL'd driver for it in beta test.
