All userspace hardware drivers with DMA will require pinned pages (and some
of them will require continuous memory). Since this memory may be scheduled
to be accessed by DMA, reclaiming those pages may (aka. will) result in
"random" memory corruption unless done by the driver itself.
You can't even set a time limit, the driver may have allocated all DMA
memory to queued transfers, and some media needs to get plugged in by
the lazy robot. As soon as the robot arrives - boom. (For the same reason,
this memory MUST NOT be freed if the application terminates abnormally,
e.g. killed by OOM).
In other words, you need to make this memory as unaccessible as the
framebuffer on a graphic card. If that causes a lockup, you better had
prevented that while allocating.

Choosing Data loss vs. finitely stalled system may sometimes be a bad
decision.
If I designes an application that might get a "gimme memory or die",
I'd reserve an extra bunch of memory with the only purpose of being
released in this situation. If the kernel had done that instead, this
part of memory could have been used e.g. as a read-only disk cache in
the meantime (off cause provided somebody cared to implement that).

Then you'd need only one signal.
I think this interface is usefull, it would e.g. allow a picture viewer
to cache as many decoded and scaled pictures as the RAM permits, freeing
them if the RAM gets full and the swap would have to be used.
