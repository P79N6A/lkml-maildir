OK I haven't worked on arm much at all. Only had to port one board
before, and didn't need to get too involved.
Can't two devices share the same interrupt line? Not talking about a
cascading interrupt controller, but two actual devices that can trigger
a single interrupt line.  So, if this is the case, how do you disable a
particular source without going to the driver itself?
If this is not the case, and the interrupt line that is shared has
another controller that the devices are separated on, then this is
trivial.  But I don't know the setup in question.
