Has anyone had a chance to review this new update to see if it now passes 
muster for mainline inclusion?
As a owner of Areca hardware I sure appreciate the responsiveness and work 
they have done in respects to Linux support. Thanks to Randy, Christoph, 
Randy and others for their work as well!

   1- remove internal queueing
   2- remove odd ioctls
   3- remove useless forward prototypes
   4- give types like ACB useful names
   5- give variable useful names, especially follow kernel conventions,
      e.g. a struct pci_dev is usually named pdev
   6- kill ->proc_info method
   7- use normal comment style even for comments not fitting into the
      kernel-doc item above.  kill useless separator comments without
      text
   8- convert arcmsr_show_firmware_info to useful one value per
      file attributes.
   9- convert arcmsr_show_driver_state to useful one value per
      file attributes.
  10- remove never called release method in the host template
  11- remove shutdown notifier, add pci_driver ->shutdown method instead
  12- remove CameCase PCI Ids.  The vendor Id should go into pci_ids.h,
      the device ids either removed or spelled the normal linux way
  13- arcmsr_do_interrupt should stop walking the global host list
      and use the private data passed to request_irq
  14- the global host list go away completely
  15- locking to be redone.
  16- arcmsr_device_probe rewritten to do goto-based
      error unwinding.
  17- remove msi options
  18- remove arcmsr_scsi_host_template_init
  19- the hardware documentation move from arcmsr.h
      into a separate file (Documentation/scsi/arcmsr_spec.txt)
  20- remove the SCSISTAT_* defines
  21- split arcmsr.c into arcmsr_attr.c from arcmsr_hba.c
