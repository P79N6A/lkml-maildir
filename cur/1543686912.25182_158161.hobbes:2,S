Hi Con
First of all, thanks a lot for all the hard work on the scheduler. A lot
of people are looking forward to 2.6 and your work is a major part of
the desktop user elements of this next kernel generation. 
I am not one of those who can judge much difference from 15 to 16 e.g.
but I do know that not using any of your patches is a major step back in
interactivity and general feeling of responsiveness of my system. Been
using your patches since the 6th iteration. Back then juk (the kde
jukebox thingy) was a major skipping candidate under heavy load, which
nowadays is almost smooth as silk. 
I am pretty sure when 2.6.0 is released on the world your scheduler is
that fine tuned and matured to make the new kernel a must have for
everyone. And you will get there even when you do not work late at night
each day to get the latest improvments to us as fast as possible hehe.
Just to keep you from too many sleepless nights ;)
Until then I will continue applying your patches  as soon as they get
out and look out for anything suspicious that might catch my attention
=)
Keep up the great work!
