Heh. Just shows how wellknown that interface is - it seems like it's only 
used by the ipw2100 driver and "pcm_native".
But yes, that looks like the right thing.

Do we actually have the latency information for these things? Especially 
since I assume a number of people use the specialized direct-hw-access 
cpufreq drivers..
I realize that we *have* "transition_latency" at the cpufreq layer, and it 
is supposed to be in ns, but I wonder how likely it is to bear any 
relationship to reality, considering that I don't think it's really used 
for anything.. (yeah, it affects the heuristics, but I don't think it has 
any _hard_ meaning, so I'd worry that it's not necessarily something that 
people have tried to make accurate).
But I dunno.
