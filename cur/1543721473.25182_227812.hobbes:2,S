Funny, Linux just added fnclex to a critical path on popular request.
But I guess it will need to be removed again, we already discussed
that.

This sounds like a serious kernel bug that should be fixed if
true. Can you perhaps create a simple demo program that shows the
problem and post it?
On what CPUs does the failure occur? Linux uses different paths
depending on if the CPU supports SSE or not.
Does your program receive signals? Could it be related to them?
