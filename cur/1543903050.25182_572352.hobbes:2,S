There are plenty of validation and debugging features in the kernel that go WAY 
beyond mere assertions, often imposing significant overhead (particularly when 
you scale up) or creating interfaces you'd never use unless you were doing 
kernel development work.  You really do want these features completely removed 
from production kernels.
The point of this is not to remove one-line WARN_ON and BUG_ON checks (though we 
might remove a few from fast paths), but rather to disable big chunks of 
debugging code that don't implement anything visible to a production workload.
