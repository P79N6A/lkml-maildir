The BSD socket API already has a clean and extensible way of dealing
with multiple namespaces, so there's plenty of precedent about how to
do this without requiring multiple syscalls.

Good question --- what is the reason you need these, and are other
security modules likely to need similar functionality?  If so, there's
an argument for new syscalls which take a credentials/sid area as a
return argument.
