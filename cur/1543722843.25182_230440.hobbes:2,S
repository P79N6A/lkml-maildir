  [PATCH] cpumask: rewrite cpumask.h - single bitmap based implementation
  From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
  Major rewrite of cpumask to use a single implementation, as a struct-wrapped
  bitmap.
Altered the cpumask iterators to add a volatile to the bitmap type. 
This might be correct for x86 and itanium, but it isn't for parisc where
our bitmap operators don't take volatile pointers.  This makes our
compile incredibly noisy in just about every file:
  CC      mm/rmap.o
In file included from include/linux/sched.h:15,
                 from include/linux/mm.h:4,
                 from mm/rmap.c:29:
include/linux/cpumask.h: In function `__cpu_set':
include/linux/cpumask.h:86: warning: passing arg 2 of `set_bit' discards
qualifiers from pointer target type
include/linux/cpumask.h: In function `__cpu_clear':
include/linux/cpumask.h:92: warning: passing arg 2 of `clear_bit'
discards qualifiers from pointer target type
Since whether the bitmap operators are volatile or not is within the
province of the architecture to decide, I think the correct fix is just
to drop the spurious volatiles from cpumask.h
