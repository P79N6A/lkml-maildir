Did that, waited almost 10 seconds, didn't help.  I found a printed
version of the SD spec; it turned out to be a power supply problem.
Apparently the power supply is not strong enough and/or the card
very sensitive to power fluctuations; put in another piece of hardware
with redesigned power supply the card works fine.
Sorry for the noise!
Thanks,
