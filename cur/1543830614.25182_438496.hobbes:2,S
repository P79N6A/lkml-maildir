Ok, so the problem is that ntp in this case runs on the host side as
opposed to the guest? This would explain why Eric is reacting vehemently
to the suggestion.

yes, thats what i was thinking. Even go further and actually create
guestxx-eth0 on the host (which results in creating eth0 on the guest)
and other things.

Ok, above may be good enough and doesnt require any state it seems on
the host side. 
I got motivated when the word "migration" was mentioned. I understood it
to be meaning that a guest may become inoperative for some reason and
that its info will be transfered to another guest which may be local or
even remote. In such a case, clearly one would need a protocol and the
state of all guests sitting at the host. Maybe i am over-reaching.
