There is more.
Not executing external code, but trusting external data.
e.g. The symbios(*1)-SCSI-driver only shows devices enabled in its BIOS.
This information is stored in a little NVRAM-chip(*2) and the driver
uses this data, including bus-speed settings and the like.
At least i (had/have*3) trouble with this "feature"!
*1: NCR, Symbios-Logic, LSI-Logic, whatever they are called today
*2: You need anything "bigger" than the 810-model
*3: I'm not sure if i still have trouble with this feature because i
haven't changed the setup in my computer for 3 years, it MAY be that i
still use a workaround for this feature. My next computer won't have
SCSI anymore, so i don't care if i still use a workaround.
