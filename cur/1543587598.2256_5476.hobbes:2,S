Hi,
On my athlong K7 optimized kernel prints "unknown" fir oricessir type.
(I have not realized what this "unknown" stood for until today.)
 #uname -p
unknown
#uname -a
Linux duron 2.4.3 #2 Fri Apr 6 04:38:35 JST 2001 i686 unknown
It would be nice to have the processor name printed.
Is this kernel configuration procedure issue or
`uname` problem?
# which uname
/bin/uname
# file /bin/uname
/bin/uname: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1,
dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped
# uname --version
uname (GNU sh-utils) 2.0
