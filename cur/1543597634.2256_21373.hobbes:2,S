Ouch, I only did a quick test with the OOM killer and the
swap space reclaim patch and it worked in my quick test.
This means the OOM killer should be tuned, or more precisely,
the code deciding when the OOM killer kicks in should be tuned.
The code involved is very easy, so I'll explain it a bit and
ask for volunteers to tweak the code and fix the OOM behaviour.
The functions/places you may want to tweak are:
mm/vmscan.c::kswapd()
	else if (out_of_memory()) {
		oom_kill()
mm/oom_kill.c::out_of_memory()
regards,
Rik
