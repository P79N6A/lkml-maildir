It seems to be related to an alias that has no module definition.

Sorry, I screwed that up.  modprobe is stil around, it's just a

But that messages appears in modutils and not in module-init-tools
AFAICT.
I would guess that you have a high-priority $PATH to old modprobe
than to the new modprobe...
