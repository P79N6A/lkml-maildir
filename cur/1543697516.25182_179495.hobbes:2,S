Subject: [I810_AUDIO] 10/x: Fix reads/writes % 4 != 0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/11/23/11

This patch removes another bogus chunk of code that breaks when
the application does a partial write.
In particular, a read/write of x bytes where x % 4 != 0 will loop forever.
