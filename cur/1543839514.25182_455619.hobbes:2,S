Thanks.  I have reproduced it and I can see what is different.  There
is a call of security_task_to_inode that was added to the /proc/self
inode creation.
The following patch works around the problem, by preserving the
current behavior of security label assignment.  I have yet to work out
why having a different security label causes failure for a world
accessible symlink.
I am starting to suspect that security_task_to_inode is a fundamentally
flawed concept, as I can get around it by opening a file before the security
label changes, and still have access to it.   Which in proc is a bad
thing.  But there are already checks on the paths that have sensitive
data so I'm not certain what the point of security_task_to_inode.
I have a bunch more digging to do to understand what is really going
on and if any of it makes sense.
Currently it looks like the good fix will be to just delete security_task_to_inode.
But I won't generate the patch for that until I dig into this farther.
