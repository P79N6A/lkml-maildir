Alpha uses this from day 1, BTW.
Also, in 2.5 we have "isa_bridge" stuff which was intended exactly for
that - it's a pointer to pci device (real ISA bridge with appropriate
dma_mask) that can be used by non-busmastering ISA devices as a pci_dev *
arg to pci_* mapping functions.

Given a huge number of various ISA bridges found in x86 systems,
I don't see a generic way to determine which ones can do 32-bit DMA...
Maybe kind of white list?
Ivan.
