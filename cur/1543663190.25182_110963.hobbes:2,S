well, I'm no networking guru, but here are some of the things that seem
useful to me:
Try to use `struct sock' where you can.  For example, using sk->stamp
would allow the SIOCGSTAMP ioctl to be dealt with at a higher level.
Right now, atm uses a timestamp embedded in vcc.  (Actually, I think
I see how to do this one.  I'll send you a patch for your review and
testing, OK?)
Figure out what actually needs to be locked and lock only that.
spinlocks are, by and large, the right solution -- having a Big ATM Lock
isn't a good thing (though I do recognise that you may want to do this
temporarily while you work on fixing it properly).
You should probably do away with SOCKOPS_WRAP / SOCKOPS_WRAPPED.  The
BKL doesn't really protect you from much any more.
Might want to consider converting the proc files to the seqfile interface.
There seems to be some custom doubly-linked-list handling going on in
atm/resources.c.  Should probably be switched to use <linux/list.h>.
I don't like the look of the locking in ipcommon.c:skb_migrate().
If there's really no better way of doing it, I'd recommend something like:
	spinlock_t *first, *second;
	if ((unsigned long)from < (unsigned long) to)) {
		first = &from->lock;
		second = &to->lock;
	} else {
		first = &to->lock;
		second = &from->lock;
	}
	local_irq_save(flags);
	spin_lock(&first);
	spin_lock(&second);
(note that you can leave the spin_unlock and spin_unlock_irqrestore
calls as they are).
That's just a quick survey... I'm sure someone who actually uses ATM
could find more things to look at ;-)
