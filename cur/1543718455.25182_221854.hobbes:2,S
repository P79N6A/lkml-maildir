Well, I wouldn't put it that way, but it would give your app suboptimal 
performance.

When you say homenode here, do you mean restricted memory allocation?  If so, 
then yes, that would be useful.  And we have it already with libnuma and 
sched_setaffinity.  If you mean some sort of preferred allocation node, then 
no, we don't have that, and it wouldn't be of much benefit I think (relative 
to what we already have).  The idea is to do "pretty good" by default, but 
still allow the user full control if they want to be sure.

The kernel does a pretty good job of keeping processes on the CPU they've been 
running on, and thus they'll probably stay close to their memory.  But 
without explicit pinning, there's no guarantee.
