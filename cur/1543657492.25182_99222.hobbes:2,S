Hmm.. Wouldn't it be nicer to instead of :
   ...
	 menu "Ethernet (1000 Mbit)"
	        depends on NETDEVICES
	+config NET_GIGABIT_ETH
	+       bool "Ethernet (1000 Mbit)"
	+       ---help---
	+         Ethernet (also called IEEE 802.3 or ISO 8802-2) is the most common
   ...
have
   ...
	+config NET_GIGABIT_ETH
        +       bool "Ethernet (1000 Mbit)"
	+	depends on NETDEVICES
        +       ---help---
        +         Ethernet (also called IEEE 802.3 or ISO 8802-2) is the most common
	   ... 
	menu "Ethernet (1000 Mbit)" 
		depends on NET_GIGABIT_ETH
   ...
so that the you don't even see the things if you don't select for them?
Untested, but it would seem to be the more natural approach..
