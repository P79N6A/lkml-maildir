Right now, all controllers are part of the NVIDIA chipset which should
mean the are on the same PCI bandwidth.    The block diagram does indicate
the 4 sata channels as one unit, though I don't know exactly how things
were internally done, performance testing seems to indicate that all
3 I am using are independent hardware as they don't seem to affect each
others load.
I am currently retesting under 2.6.17.8 to see if I have similar issues
there, under that it show interrupts like below, different interrupt 
numbers,
but similar sharing as ata1/ata2, and ata3/ata4 are on the same interrupt.
ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xEC00 ctl 0xE802 bmdma 0xDC00 irq 16
ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xE400 ctl 0xE002 bmdma 0xDC08 irq 16
ata1: SATA link up 3.0 Gbps (SStatus 123)
