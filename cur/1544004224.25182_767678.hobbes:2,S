I think the added barrier() are causing these pipeline stalls. They
don't allow the compiler to read variables such as oscr2ns_scale before
the barrier because gcc cannot assume it won't be modified. However, to
insure that OSCR read is done after __m_cnt_hi read, this barrier seems
required to be safe against gcc optimizations.
Have you compared my patch to Nicolas'patch, which adds a smp_rmb() in
the macro or to a vanilla tree ?
I wonder if reading those values sooner would help gcc ?
