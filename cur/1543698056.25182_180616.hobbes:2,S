Oh! That sounds nice. I also run the latest 1007 BIOS, but that
doesn't help at all. In crontrary, I almost have the impression that
the lockups got worse, but that may be just subjective. But what do
you mean with "1007 Uber BIOS"? What is this "Uber"? Is that a special
BIOS Version?
However, 2.6.0-test9-mm3 might be the key. I'll test this immediately.
Thanks,
Julien
