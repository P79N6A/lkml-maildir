Actually page tables used exclusively by software during the cross
partition coordination.  Those entries are inserted on the remote side
by normal faults with VM_PFNMAP vmas created by the importing side.

In our guest case, we can not access the kernel struct page area on the
remote host.  We therefore handle all the ref/deref of the page as part
of messaging the PFN across the partition boundaries.
