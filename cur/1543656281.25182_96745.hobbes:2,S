Subject: Problem using "make config/xconfig" with 2.4.20 on Redhat 7.3

I must be doing something wrong, but I can't figure out what.
I've downloaded kernel version 2.4.20 from 
http://www.kernel.org
 and copied
it to the /usr/src/linux-2.4.20 directory, but when I do "make xconfig" (or
any other "make" for that matter, it exits with error code 2.
I figure there is some Redhat-specific tweaking I must do to compile a
generic kernel from 
http://www.kernel.org
 on a Redhat system, but I have no
idea what that specific tweaking is.  The people at the Redhat-devel list
were of no help so I'm turning to you guys.
Could someone help me, please?
BTW, I'm using Redhat Linux 7.3.
Here's my output from "make xconfig":
rm -f include/asm
( cd include ; ln -sf asm-i386 asm)
make -C scripts kconfig.tk
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.20/scripts'
cat header.tk >> ./kconfig.tk
./tkparse < ../arch/i386/config.in >> kconfig.tk
-: 6: unknown command
make[1]: *** [kconfig.tk] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.20/scripts'
make: *** [xconfig] Error 2
TIA
