No, the "get_mem_map" and "mem_map_*reserve" stuff is _not_ the preferred
API, it just looks that way from the patch because the stuff that used
them were some of the heavier users of the thing that did change (ie
trying to remove MAP_NR which doesn't work all that well on discontiguous
memory areas).
