I think the point is that the API currently has no such facility.
Adding a new set of WE ioctls is unpalatable, both for general
ioctl-haters and because the WE ioctl collection is quite broad.
Maybe that could be solved by forcing the new WE stuff to use
the netlink-based WE facilities, but then you are expanding the
compatibility nightmare for whatever replaces WE.
