Yes, we need to eliminate stack and kmalloc'ed requests for this to be
completely solid. This is something we have been doing for some time
already, now would be a good time to fully complete it.
There's no way to block incoming request at ->add_request_fn() time, so
we have to do it on merge (first path) or request allocation.
