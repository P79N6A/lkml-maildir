That's OK.  See the e100 driver, it's got like 35 entries on its list
already.

But megaraid doesn't have this problem AFAIK.
And if necessary, a second pci_device_id list of IDs to test against
and exclude would be appropriate, and analogous to the pci_device_id
list that's used to accept devices.

/sys/bus/pci/driver/megaraid/new_id  already does this

Wrong.  The issue isn't "how fast can LSI provide an updated driver to
kernel.org", but "how fast can users themselves add new IDs to a
driver for their given kernel/distribution at install time without
needing to wait for LSI to produce a new driver".  Hence the new_id
trick above was introduced for 2.6 for exactly this purpose.
Thanks,
