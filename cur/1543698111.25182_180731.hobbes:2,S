Wrong mailing list.
You must find a lawyer, and he'll answer your questions.

RCU is a patented algorithm - mention that to your lawyer. Your creation 
must not be derived from the kernel (because creating derived works is 
an exclusive right of the copyright owner, and you don't have and won't 
get a permission), and it must not infringe the RCU patents.

You have written an algorithm module that is tightly coupled to the 
Linux kernel, and you think it's not derived from the kernel, correct? 
As a non-lawyer, it'd say that's wrong.
"Derived work" is a legal term, your lawyer might be able to figure out 
if your combination is a derived work.
The drivers that are more or less accepted as not-derived run on 
multiple operating systems - e.g. the nvidia ethernet driver uses the 
same source code for Windows and Linux, and nvlib.o works on Linux and 
FreeBSD.

P.S.: You might need a team of lawyers: the definition of derived work 
differs from country to country.
