Well, I stand very much corrected.  Dropped in to my friendly neighbourhood
computer dealer this evening to find two (2) people standing there with
their PCs.  Both had the same symptom: totally black screens on power-up.
Apparently the Chernobyl (aka CIH) virus _has_ struck.
BUT the good news, at least for followers of this thread, is: if your PC can
boot (or indeed display any message at all), you most likely don't have the
CIH virus, because it trashes your CMOS.  I suppose it might trash your disk
instead if it has trouble writing to the CMOS, but I haven't seen that
mentioned on any of the A-V sites I visited.
