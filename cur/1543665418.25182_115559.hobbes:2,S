But before it's actually merged, I would slowly really like to know the 
reasoning for license. You completely avoid that question and that makes 
me nervous. Why did you choose this license over any GPL variant?
We could as well integrate dietlibc and if anyone has a problem with it, 
he can still choose your klibc.
Why should I contribute to klibc instead of dietlibc?
bye, Roman
