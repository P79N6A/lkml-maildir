Wrong level at this point, IMHO.

If you do this we may end up deregistering the device and unless APM can
remember everything the devices/drives may be lost.

First we thank Mark Lord for putting to 'C' what I was banging on for a
while.
I thinkered with this with a hotswap ATA-model and have the bases, but I
do not want to fill either driver with boat loads of code that will be
deleted in 2.5 when I rewrite mine.  One of the issues to include is
bay-swapping that is critical for the testing.  This then falls back upon
the bases of hotswap device and not just disks.
Here is the event path that I think will work.
APM signals ATA/IDE to goto sleep.
IDE then records and buffers the setup of the host and device.
IDE forces device and host to PIO 0 (imortant step, explain later)
IDE issues spindown and sleep task-command.
IDE returns to APM with success/failure.
	success, sets request_queue blocker flag (very critical)
APM catches signal and calls for WAKEUP to IDE.
IDE issues soft-device rest to get attention of device. (nukes all settings)
	If supported a channel reset of the HOST also. (even better nuking)
while (twiddle thumbs)
	IDE issues check-power-1 and check-power-2 task-command, until.
IDE waits for device ready response.
HOST and Device are assumed to be in PIO 0 and this is safe assumption.
IDE recovers settings before APM(sleep) and reprograms HOST and Device.
IDE returns to APM with success/failure.
	success, clears request_queue blocker flag (very critical)
Requests are now serviced.
Does this jive with you?
