I've seen the problem on both of my computers with Creative Riva TNT2. On
this card the palette turns darker. On other cards the palette turns to
rubbish or corrupted in another fashionable ways. It's a bug in those
cards - switching to video mode and back to text mode doesn't preserve the
text mode palette so the OS must restore it by itself.
It's not an X server problem, since the problem doesn't appear on 2.2.16
for instance, no mather which X-server you are using. Search lkml archives
for "dark console" you'll see a thread from 2 months ago that discusses
about this problem exactly. Read the console.c of 2.4 - Linus already
patched it this way (your patch and then my patch), so I suggest we do the
same in 2.2.
