yup, you are right. I was the easiest, but not the best.
I'll make a patch with wakeup_klogd.

We did. Many times.
I've noticed another thing. There is a default bust_spinlocks() in 
lib/bust_spinlocks.c. 4 architectures including x86 have their own 
copies of it, which are exactly the same as the default one.
So do we really need lib/bust_spinlocks.c or we can move a signle copy 
of this function to kernel/printk.c?
