I was doing some testing on a Compaq ProLiant 380 (perhaps G2 - don't 
remember) that was doing some 70-80MB/s on a RAID-5. That was, however, on 
12 drives, 6 on each a controller. I managed to do a little more with JBOD 
and Linux Software RAID-5. That said, this was 18GB drives, which aren't 
the fastest drives on earth...
