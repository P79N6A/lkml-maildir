Although you'll not break matroxfb more than it is currently, can you
also update drivers/video/matrox/{i2c-matroxfb,matroxfb_maven}.* in 
your updates? Or I'll send you patch after this change hits Linus kernel... 
Only problem is that there are apps which search DDC channel by 
looking for i2c bus named "DDC:fbX #Y on i2c-matroxfb", and this 
looks too long for generic driver infrastructure. But "DDC:fbX #Y"
looks acceptable...
