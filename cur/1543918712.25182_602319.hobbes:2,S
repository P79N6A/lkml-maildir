Hello,
I have the following problem:
$ sudo -u ie -s # or sudo su ie
unable to change to runas uid: Resource temporarily unavailable
Works:
$ sudo su, followed by su ie
The first sudo also worked while I had a shell under user ie.
When I exited, it stopped working, but it is now working every time I
trie it.
dmesg shows:
[82602.729330] kobject_add failed for 504 with -EEXIST, don't try to
               register things with the same name in the same directory.
