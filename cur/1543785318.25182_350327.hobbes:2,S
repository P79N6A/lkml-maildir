Thanks.

There's no reason for this being typedef'ed, and it is contrary to the
kernel source CodingStyle. However, all pcmcia code was external at first,
that's why the CodingStyle differs.

Unfortunately, yes. However, I'm in the process of adapting it to the kernel
CodingStyle. I don't change something from "u_int" to "unsigned int" just for
the naming of it, though, but when I'm in the same area fixing one thing or
another, I try to take care of it. New structs, like struct pcmcia_device, 
already adhere the normal kernel policy on structs and typedefs.
Thanks,
