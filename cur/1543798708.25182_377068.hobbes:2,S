No.  Think of the pids again.  Even the "outside" of a container, things
like the real init, have to have unique pids.  What if the process's pid
is the same as one in use in the default container?

The current idea is that processes are assigned at fork-time.  The
isolation is for the lifetime of the process.

pid virtualization is simply the one that's easiest to understand, and
the one that demonstrates the largest number of issues.  It is a small
piece of the puzzle, but an important one.
