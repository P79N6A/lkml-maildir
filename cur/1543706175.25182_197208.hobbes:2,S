Subject: 2.4.25-rc1: Inconsistent ioctl symbol usage in drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c

2.4.25-rc1 drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c expects sys_ioctl,
register_ioctl32_conversion and unregister_ioctl32_conversion to be
exported symbols when MPT_CONFIG_COMPAT is defined.  That symbol is
defined for __sparc_v9__, __x86_64__ and __ia64__.
The symbols are not exported in ia64, mptctl.o gets unresolved symbols
when it is a module on ia64.
x64_64 exports register_ioctl32_conversion and unregister_ioctl32_conversion,
but not sys_ioctl.
