Subject: NPX init bugs in x86 head.S ???

Below is the code snip that checks for a hardware NPX - which it does OK.
But, how can enabling a 287 ever work in a paged environment?  A 287 NPX
only has internal registers capable of handling 16:16 segmented protected
mode addresses.  Once paging is enabled and 16:32 addresses start getting
generated I should think everything falls apart.  At a minimum, if nothing
else died first, any reported exception CS:IP's would certainly be bogus
having only 16 bits of IP coming back to the 386 from the NPX.
Am I missing something here?
