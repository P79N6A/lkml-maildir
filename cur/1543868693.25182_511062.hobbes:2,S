Well... I disagree there too :-)
I've been working recently for example on some spufs improvements that
require similar tweaking of the user address space as hugetlbfs. The
problem I have is that while there are hooks in the generic code pretty
much everywhere I need.... they are all hugetlb specific, that is they
call directly into the hugetlb code.
For now, I found ways of doing my stuff without hooking all over the
page table operations (well, I had no real choices) but I can imagine it
making sense to allow something (hugetlb being one of them) to take over
part of the user address space.
Ben.
