I don't think it was intended as a final solution but rather as a
feasibility experiment.

Good realtime support is looking like a certainty at this point,
though it may take a while for all the bits to be fully merged.

If we can get high priority SCHED_OTHER working sufficiently well,
that will be preferable in the long run as the security implications
are slightly less dire. It's already been noted that it doesn't solve
your privilege problem, but it's still interesting to us because it
has potential to address the deadlock issue.
Doesn't mean you have to use it (though you'll probably want to give
your users the option).

It may turn out to be. Please continue testing it though - you've got
a good test case handy.

Testing feedback on the bits from Ingo that have gone to -mm will
probably help speed their acceptance in mainline.
