BTW, why is Mandriva the only distro to turn OFF REGPARM?. Again, I think 
distros shouldn't be given an option to turn it off if its a good thing to have.
Are there any good reasons why REGPARM is turned off?.
------------------
Yet one more reason to have something like kernel-config (similar to gtk-config 
or xmms-config) where you can get the package's cflags, ldflags, other info.
for example
kernel-config --cflags should say -DUSE_REGPARM -I/lib/modules/blah/blah
kernel-config --libdir should say where the lib/modules/blah/blah
kernel-config --srcdir should say where the kernel sources are installed or not 
installed.
kernel-config --configsrc should configure the kernel source with the running
kernel's configuration.
kernel-config --installsrc should automatically download the RIGHT source from 
the net. Right now if you go on Ubuntu or Mandrake and you try to install kernel 
source - you get the option of stripped source, kernel-headers, kernel-2.6.blah 
which may not be installed.
Any comments?
best regards
