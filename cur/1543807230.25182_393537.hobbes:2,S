That *is* the question, isn't it.
We simply don't know, other than that this is
a visible change to any program that cares.
Gratuitis breakage of userspace is pointless.
Empirically speaking, everything I use is working fine
here with the 2G/2G split, but that's just not good enough
reason to mindlessly break other people's userspace.
Cheers
