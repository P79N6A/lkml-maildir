And those of us who are using it *have* old hardware. Old hardware that 
perhaps the people forcing other driver on us don't have.

I guess I have a real problem with the "make die hard users report 
problems" thing, because it assumes that there is nothing wrong with 
*causing* us problems. Understand, this is not "change is bad" but 
"change is expensive." Because it means a change in kernel config, 
modules.conf, and possibly rc.local or initrd or similar. A per-machine 
effort which is small in ones, and large in sum.

If this were a case of the sk98lin driver needing work, I wouldn't be 
making the argument. But to make work for users in a case where there is 
no saving in effort for developers, sounds as if the developers place no 
value at all on the time of the people who build their own kernels, and 
if the vendors are good with it, that's all that matters.
Note that because the hardware is old, it's highly likely that most of 
it will be retired before that sk98lin driver needs a change. I can't 
see anyone using sk98lin on a new system, so it would be less 
contentious to let the hardware (or users) die of natural causes if you can.
