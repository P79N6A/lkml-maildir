Hmm...  After looking at that, I'd probably add typed inlined helpers
(dentry to attr, dentry to kobject, dentry to bin_attr) and converted
to their use *before* everything else (patch #0).  And change their
definitions to use sysfs_dirent in patch #1.  That way we avoid breakage
on intermediate stages.
