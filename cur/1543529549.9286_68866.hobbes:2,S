Unfortunatelly not.
But if would be posible to somehow dividie the memory into overcommitable
and one which is not overcommitable it could help. 
Also somehow also make sure that I can designate selected regions of
memory as non-swampable as well. 
For example if I could say : I want all processed runnning as root and
attached to 'tty1' have following restrications:
	- reseverved region of non-overcommitable memory.
	- this memory region can't be swamped out as well.
Is something like this possible or am I dreaming?
