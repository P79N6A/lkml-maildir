You should not use isa_virt_to_bus.  IIRC someone on this list worried 
about this exact thing happening.

This is on the kernel janitor TODO, and we (janitors) will be tackling 
this shortly.  But your instinct is right, virt_to_bus shouldn't be 
everywhere.

This is correct.  It has been a policy to use pci_alloc_consistent 
instead of kmalloc/getfreepages and virt_to_bus, 2.5 is enforcing it now.
It is boring work to change this in many drivers, but I don't know any 
better so I think it quite fun to go in and help :).  I'll start sending 
patches to the relevant maintainers shortly.
By the way, anyone know who the maintainer is for the persistent DMA 
buffer code?
