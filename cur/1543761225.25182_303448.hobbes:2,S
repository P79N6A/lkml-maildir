As Jay Vosburgh points-out, this patch only effects ALB and TLB modes.
These are modes where the link partner is unaware of the bonded
configuration.  In effect, we are tricking the switch into behaving
the way we desire.
Since the switch is unaware of our bonded behaviour, I think it makes
sense to accomodate this quirk related to IGMP snooping.
