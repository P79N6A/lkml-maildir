Sure, but this is really just a matter of definition. The kernel defines
the ABI, right?. User space has to follow the rules. If they break the
rules
that's badluck for the userspace tools. Currently you can also
get kernel information directly from /dev/mem. If an application
does that, nobody would say, that we are not allowed to change
kernel data structures because of that user space application.

At least this parser should be well tested, if everybody uses it.
But maybe I am completely wrong here ....
