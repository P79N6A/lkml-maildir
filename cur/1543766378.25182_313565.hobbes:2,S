It is not immediately visible here that bloc.logicalBlockNum is unsigned.
One needs to check that by looking at the definition.
Also if later someone changes bloc.logicalBlockNum into signed entity, code
becomes buggy. Not good.
gcc already optimizes out such checks:
# gcc -O2 t.c -S -fomit-frame-pointer
# cat t.c t.s
extern unsigned v;
int f() {
    return v<0 || v>100 || v==50;
}
        .file   "t.c"
        .text
        .p2align 2,,3
.globl f
        .type   f, @function
f:
        movl    v, %edx
        xorl    %eax, %eax
        cmpl    $100, %edx
        ja      .L3
        cmpl    $50, %edx
        je      .L3
        ret
        .p2align 2,,3
.L3:
        movl    $1, %eax
        ret
        .size   f, .-f
        .section        .note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
