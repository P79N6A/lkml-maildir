If you're coding up new readahead schemes, it may be worth taking into
account Papathanasiou and Scott, `Energy Efficient Prefetching and
Caching'
( 
http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix04/tech/general/papathanasiou/papathanasiou_html/index.html
)
which describes tuning of readahead for optimum disk energy usage,
while not compromising performance.
Here's the abstract:
       Traditional disk management strategies--prefetching and caching
       in particular--are designed to maximize performance. In mobile
       systems they conflict with strategies that attempt to save
       energy by powering down the disk when it is idle. We present
       new rules for prefetching and caching that maximize power-down
       opportunities (without performance loss) by creating an access
       pattern characterized by intense bursts of activity separated
       by long idle times. We also describe an automatic system that
       monitors past application behavior in order to generate
       appropriate prefetching hints, and a general system of kernel
       enhancements that coordinate I/O activity across all running
       applications.
       We have implemented our system in the Linux kernel, and have
       measured its performance and energy consumption via physical
       instrumentation of a running laptop. We describe our
       implementation and present quantitative results. For workloads
       including a mix of sequential access to large files
       (multimedia), concurrent access to large numbers of files
       (compilation), and random access to large files (speech
       recognition), we report disk energy savings of 60-80%, with
       negligible loss in throughput or interactive responsiveness.
