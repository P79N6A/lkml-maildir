Uhh, 15 or 20 seconds even. That's a long time by any kernel standard.

It would be nice to have threads that can be "fired off" from an
interrupt context.  That would simplify the EEH code slightly 
(removing a few dozen lines of code that do this bounce).
I presume that various device drivers might find this useful as well.
