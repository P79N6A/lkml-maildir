Incorporated all feedback received:
 - Explicitly allow people to dereference sb->buf and sb->len, and include
   comments about the potential problems with doing so.  Document that alloc
   is probably better left unreferenced.  Remove sb_len() and sb_string().
 - Ensure that we grow by at least 1.5x, even if we're using slob.
 - Start by allocating 128 bytes
 - Pass a gfp_t to sb_printk
 - Drop the bogus change to snd_ac97_proc_regs_write
 - Add stringbuf.o to obj-y instead of lib-y, otherwise a fully modular kernel
   might not pull in sb_printf

operating system, but compare it to ours.  We can't possibly take such
a retrograde step."
