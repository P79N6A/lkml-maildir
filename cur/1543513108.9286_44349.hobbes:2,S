Hello Andries,
The phantasy address was cut'n'pasted in haste - sorry if it was slightly 
wrong, completely unintentional.
Sneaky and strange? (hmm, I feel like without hands when there is no 
dict(1) command around :)
Anyway, thank you for the URL of the 3rd BFS implementation - I will go 
and read it now.
Regards,
Tigran.
PS. I didn't drop torvalds@transmeta.com from cc as the risk of being called 
"sneaky" was higher than the risk of undesirable disturbance.
