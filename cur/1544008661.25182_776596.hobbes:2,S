The purpose of LIM is to provide an integrity infrastructure to support 
different types of integrity data.  IMA implements both the LIM
API for it's own internal use, and exports it for others to call.
As Dave Safford pointed out in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/11/17/362,
there are other projects that want to add differently structured
measurements to the TPM measurement list.  The template abstraction is
critical to allowing these differently formatted messages to be added to
the list.
