This is the dhcp entry for a host that I use to tftp a kernel from a 
different machine to that running dhcpd:
                host tasslehoff
                {
                        hardware ethernet       00:10:57:00:03:EC;
                        fixed-address           tasslehoff;
                        next-server             raistlin;
                        filename                "/usr/src/k/tasslehoff";
                }
The booting host is called "tasslehoff".  The tftp server host is called
"raistlin", and the dhcp server is called "flint".
According to Tom, this should also cause Linux to nfs mount from the
"next-server" address, and it is fair that this is not documented by
the dhcp man pages since it appears to be a Linux Kernel quirk.
