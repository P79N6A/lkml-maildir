I'm new to the list, but I'll be a regular, you can be sure... :)  That's pretty good tho.  Personally, I would
lean more towards Barney - he's an ActiMate(tm) already, isn't he?  Maybe M$-Arthur(tm)?  He looks kinda like
Big Bill anyway, doesn't he? hehe.

It's the minah bird.  That sucker's cute.  If this is a M$ mascot, I'm sure they're gonna pick something
that subliminally spells 'power' to the consumer, and something that has the power to grab attention.  Something
that just shouts 'I am the begin-all and end-all of the personal computer.  Fear me and love me.'  Reminds me of
something from the Bible..  Okay..  I'm done now.
