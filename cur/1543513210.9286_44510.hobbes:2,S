Thanks for the quick answer. I've thought about upgrading the kernel.
But apart from poor harddisk performance the small
proxy/isdn-router/qmail/dial-in/dns-cache/dhcp/samba server runs just
fine with SuSE 6.2/kernel 2.2.10: never change a running system.
Is there an unofficial upgrade/patch for SuSE 6.2?
Thanks,
Joerg
