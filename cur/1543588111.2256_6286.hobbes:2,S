BTW, I didn't mention it explicitly, but this kernel is *not*
Athlon-optimized (since I used it for several months on a P II and IIRC,
2.2.17 didn't offer Athlon-optimizaations anyway). It was compiled with gcc
2.95.2.
The motherboard is an Asus A7V133 with the KT133A chipset which probably
has the UDMA bug, but this shouldn't affect me since I'm only using SCSI on
the Athlon machine.
