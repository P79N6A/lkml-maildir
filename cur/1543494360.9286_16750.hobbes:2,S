To Linux, a floppy is just a small removable disk, just like an MO
drive is a (moderately) large removable disk.
So if someone tells you that this problem can be caused by a a bad
media changed signal, then you should interpret that in the context
of your situation: your MO drive seems to have a bad media changed
signal...
Wether that's firmware in the MO drive or a physical problem in the
drive, I don't know....
