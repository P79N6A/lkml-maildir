I don't believe having so many algorithms is such a pain. It gives users more 
choices. I've spoke to people who will not trust AES, 3DES, SHA, and even 
the AES finalists because they believe NIST/NSA only picked weak algorithms. 
Obviously there will be a default algorithm (probably AES and SHA1), so I 
don't think having more algorithms will cause users problems. Only problem I 
see is maintaining all of them.
