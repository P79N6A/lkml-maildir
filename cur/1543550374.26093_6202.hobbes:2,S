Unless someone fixed it recently, when jffs was ported to 2.4, it lost the
ability to run on block devices and can currently only operate via the mtd
layer. In the 2.0.x kernels, it could target block devices.
For things like disk-on-module (ide flash disks) it would be nice to use it on
general block devices as well, since many dom vendors (i.e. sandisk) do not do
wearleveling in hardware (they instead keep a few spare blocks in reserve),
