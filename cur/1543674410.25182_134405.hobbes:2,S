Cool.  That was the cause of some of the radical differences in behavior 
between smp and up kernels.  The sync wakeup in pipe wait for example was 
the irman process load climbs through the roof problem, and it also affects 
the ext3 concurrency problem if you have gcc using -pipe.  See attached log.
