Rusty,
 this makes no sense:
D: This changes the implementation so that the waker actually unpins
D: the page.  This is preparation for the async interface, where the
D: process which registered interest is not in the kernel.
Whazzup? The closing of the fd will unpin the page, the waker has no
reason to do so. It is very much against the linux philosophy (and a
design disaster anyway) to have the waker muck with the data structures of
anything waiting.
