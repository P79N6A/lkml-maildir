Ok.
If nobody screams (especially Len who has to accept this in the end, I
don't want to do work for nothing..), I'll try an implementation that:
  - Allows lowering trip points
  - If BIOS modifies trip points, the overridden ones might also
    get lowered if they are even lower
  - Allow the definition of a passive trip point (with some default
    values for hysteresis), even if the thermal zone does not
    provide one
If we have something like this, we could still discuss a config option,
that also allows to increase trip points, marking it with "If you set
this you can destroy your machine, you have been warned...". While this
would not be an option for distributions to compile in, some people may
come around the biggest hammer -> overriding DSDT.
I cannot promise, but I try to get this for 2.6.24.
