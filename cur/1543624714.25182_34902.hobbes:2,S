Hi all,
I hope that this question is not too simple for this list. After many attempts I
finally gave up and ask for some help.
I would like to recompile the kernel (after some code modification - no hacking,
just a research project). So the first step would be to try to recompile the
kernel in the default (that is, installed) configuration. But where is it (the
config file)? /usr/src/linux-2.4/.config is far from the installed
configuration. Should it be
/usr/src/linux-2.4.7-10/configs/kernel-2.4.7-10-i686.config? When I copy this
file to /usr/src/linux-2.4/.config and perform make dep, make clean and make
bzImage, I get errors in apic.c (e.g. 389: nmi_watchdog undefined, and some more
undefined symbols).
So my question is: where is the config file with the default (installation)
configuration?
RedHat 7.2, kernel 2.4.7-10, Pentium II machine.
Best regards,
Marek
