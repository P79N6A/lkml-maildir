You can tweak it all as you want:
int* foo_p;
void bar(const int *local_var) {
  *foo_p = *local_var + 1;
}
int main() {
  int foo;
  foo_p = &foo;
  printf("%d\n", foo);
  bar(&foo);
  printf("%d\n", foo);
  return 0;
}
The fact is that gcc can't suppose anything unless you say explicitly it can.
That is why 'pure' and 'const' __attributes__ exist, it supposes aliasing
by default and so on.
