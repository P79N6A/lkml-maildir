Btw, if you really want to allow negative ("huge positive") loff_t, then
you should do it the way we did "file->f_maxcount", and just have a u64
"file->f_maxpos" that we initialize to LONG_LONG_MAX or something like
that by default.
Then, the kmem_open() routine could set it to ULONG_LONG_MAX, and the
rw_verify_area check would change from comparing pos for being negative to
an unsigned compare of pos against "f_maxpos".
(That would also allow filesystems to limit the position to 32-bit values
if they wanted to, and felt that they didn't want to even handle anything
else).
