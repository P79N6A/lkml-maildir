I actually second Matt's request; -RCs à la 2.4.
Then your above becomes:
2.6.x-rc: bugfixes only
2.6.x-pre: bugfixes and features
And then that doesn't confuse end users either.
Not to mention that if we adopt a strict release candidate release style
(ie. last -rc is renamed to release), then you get to move some of the
burden of testing to the end user. Hopefully that will encourage more
people to test -rcs rather than "tricking" them into doing the testing.
And if we really make an effort to only do the first -rc with the
expectation that it will be the *only* one, then that will be a pretty
good incentive to test.
