Hi, Tejun,
I was just looking over these changes...

Maybe I'm missing something, but this looks racy to me.  There's no
check after schedule() to see if module_unload_inhibit_cnt is really
zero, and nothing to keep somebody else from slipping in and raising it
again afterward.
Given your description of this tool as a "sledgehammer," might it not be
easier to just take and hold module_mutex for the duration of the unload
block?
