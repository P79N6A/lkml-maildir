Hi Benjamin,
Your patch indeed fixed most of the problems I was having but 
unfortunately not all of them.  Namely a simple "hello.c" program linked 
with more than libc now works but complex ones like vim or crash or 
cscope still coredump (whilst working very happily on 2.3.24) later on in 
a mmap-related areas.
Anyway, now that I can work with 2.3.32-pre2 (+your patch) it is easier 
to investigate this further,
Btw, with parenthises as below it silences gcc:

Thanks again guys,
