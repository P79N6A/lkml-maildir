Wrong or not wrong depends largely on the point of view :-)
If the BIOS has a certain concept of some particular feature
and Linux does have one as well, albeit different from the 
one of the BIOS, this doesn't necessarily mean that the BIOS
get's it "wrong." If, however, the BIOS deals with things in
a way not compatible to existing specifications, the situation
is different.
One of the central issues of the discussion at hand is that due to
the fact that the source code of the BIOS is not accessible,
we are not able to improve upon it and, as a consequence,
have to accept the way it acts...

I guess we all would like to get the proprietary software (with
no available source code) out of the PC. Or, even better, forget
about the PC at all :-) (one of my biggest enemies is the word 
'legacy').

Yes. I already supposed that it was not that easy. But we already 
have a lot of input: the OpenBIOS things, experience from the 
LinuxBIOS project, the source code of the Award BIOS, etc. I think 
it's not too much of gambling to conclude that a solution (i.e.
booting Linux from a customizable and lean open source BIOS) is not 
that far away...
