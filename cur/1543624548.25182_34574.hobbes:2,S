Let me mention this again... The IBM release of NGPT states that Linus has
approved the inclusion of the NGPT patches in the mainline kernel. Will
this be in 2.4.19 release? I've been running 2.4.17 for NGPT, haven't
tried 2.4.19 other than to see the patch didn't apply).
(NGPT = Next Generation Pthreads, a cleaner and faster POSIX threads)
