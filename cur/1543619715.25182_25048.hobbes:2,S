I've done substantial AIM7 benchmarking on a 28p ia64 NUMA system, and
llseek's BKL usage is a significant contributor to poor scaling.  For
500 AIM7 "tasks" and ext2 filesystems, waiting on the BKL consumes about
half of the available CPU cycles, and sys_lseek()'s usage is the most
significant cycle waster, followed by ext2_get_block() and
ext2_write_inode().  Anton's llseek patch from last November does make
a measurable improvement in AIM7 throughput.
