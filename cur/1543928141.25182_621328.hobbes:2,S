I don't know the details.

That seems doable in principle.  I'll have a closer look at it.

The freezer will not wait for this particular task.  Still, the task will have
TIF_FREEZE set, so it will freeze as soon as freezer_count() is reached,
unless the thawing of tasks is carried out first.
If used in the right place, it's reasonably safe, but we need to know what
the right place is.  [That's how we handle vfork(), BTW.]

Not exactly. :-)

Agreed, but the only way to tell the freezer "don't wait for this task", if the
task in question is in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, is to annotate it.
