Why should the bitsize of the CPU matter for this?  It seems one of the 
less meaningful keys for this.
Second, as I have mentioned, I don't believe this is really the case, 
especially not for the PIT, which is still present -- the PIT 
*semantics* has explicit timing constraints.
Third, you still have ISA devices, they're just called LPC or PC104 
devices these days.
