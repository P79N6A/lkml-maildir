This the last of the messages test4-mm2 gives
when trying to boot:
BIOS EDD facility v0.09 2003-Jan-22, 2 devices found
md: Autodetecting RAID arrays.
md: autorun ...
md: considering hdb1 ...

md: ... autorun DONE.
Mounted devfs on /dev
Freeing unused kernel memory: 348k freed
Kernel Panic: no init found.  Try passing init= ...
No surprise it couldn't find an init when it didn't mount
a root.  Seems it didn't even try - there is no
error message about any failed attempt.
test4-mm1 with the same config works on the same machine,
and mounts root between "md: ... autorun DONE" and  "Mounted devfs on /dev"
Root is supposed to be on the raid array, which did come up.
Lilo uses append="root=/dev/md/0".
