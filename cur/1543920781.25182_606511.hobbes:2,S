The person is in one of two states:
1) He has been told "recreate the problem, hit alt-sysreq-cokebottle,
and send me the results".  He has a mission, and the only feedback he
needs is (a) that he hit cokebottle and not pepsibottle, and (b) the
resulting output.
2) He's already read the file in Documentation/ and just needs a reminder.
In this case, the fact it's only 2 or 3 lines and doesn't scroll other stuff
out of sight is more important.

You're optimizing code that hopefully never gets executed, and even if
it does, you have the optimization *backwards*.  If you're worried about
the efficiency, trim it down to output 3 lines - do you realize how many
instructions it takes in the VGA and fb drivers to actually *output* all
these lines? (Seriously - I had a 1.6Ghz P4 laptop, where scrolling the
screen with vga=791 actually ran so slowly that it horqued up the timer
initialization code. *That* was a fun bug to figure out..)

And ironically enough, you then output the same exact text for all levels.

The lists of 'Not defined' tends to scroll the screen away. The old code
instead focuses on listing the things you *can* do.  If I'm looking at the
help output, I don't care that 'g' is not defined.  I need to be reminded
that 'p' is 'showPc' and D is show-all-locks.
