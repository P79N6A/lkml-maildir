Yes, some have cmos, some have CCDs.
Beside, I am a bit puzzled by the credit that has been
given to that slashdot comment, when a simple search  on
"ccd chip logitech 3000 pro"  provides  a  link  on  the
description of the CCD chip inside that  cam  in  a  few
clicks :
http://www.sony.net/Products/SC-HP/new_tec/ccd/icx098.html
2  more  clicks  on  Sony's  site  give  acces  to   the
datasheets of  the  different  versions  of  the  icx098
(color or b/w).
And that was the hard  way:  if  you  search  "ccd  chip
philips webcam" you have the  reference  on  the  result
page and access to the specs on the first site returned.

Did I mention icx098 is a 640x480 CCD chip, whatever the
version ?
