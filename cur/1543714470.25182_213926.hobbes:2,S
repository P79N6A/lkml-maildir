The reservation window code kind of knows the group boundaries. The
reason why we did this was, we want to fit it into existing 
ext3_get_newblock() code easily. ext3_get_newblock() operates on each
group and passes a bitmap for each group to work on. The current code
looks for a reservation window in the given group (since we need bitmap to
verify that there is something allocatable in that group).  
To make the reservation window ignore groups, we may need to do some major 
surgery to ext3_get_newblock().

That was the first place I looked, i need to look at it one more time to see
if we can reuse the logic.
