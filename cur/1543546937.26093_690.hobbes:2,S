My proposal does not require any more of a distinction than is already
in the spec: the spec repeatedly warns that thread ids are not necessarily
visible outside the process and the notion of a thread within a process
is all over the spec.
e.g.
|This standard includes system interfaces to support applications with
|requirements for multiple flows of control, called
|threads, within a process. 
And one of the problems that motivated this discussion was the POSIX
requirement that a signal sent to a "multithreaded process" be sent to 
some thread that has enabled that signal or, if no thread is willing
to accept it, the signal must be  marked pending and then
delivered to the first thread that enables that signal.  When 
threads are processes it's a pain to implement this.

But some things are specified in grotesque detail -- eg. this signal 
delivery mechanism. Or consider 
pthread_cancel and the elaborate set of cancellation states. Or pthread_join,
a relic from the days when Modula and CSP were considered serious 
programming languages.

I'm generally in favor of POSIX, but the spec does wander into pet-theories
too much.

What I want is a spec that says: here is the standard API and a coherent
set of expected semantics that allow users to write portable programs. 
Such a spec might easily say: if you mix threads with async I/O you
are in trouble, if you use process signals as IPC to threads you are
in trouble, ...
POSIX does do that enough to make it usable -- invaluable, but not enough
to make me happy.
