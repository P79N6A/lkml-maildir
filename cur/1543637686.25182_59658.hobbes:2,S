Hello I reported problem with tdfx framebuffer driver at Tue, 16 Jul 2002 
10:30:10 +0200
Now in 2.4.19-rc3 things become worser :(
When I switch into append="video=tdfx:1024x768-24@75" my console switch, 
penguin is still black-white, its background become black, but I CANT SEE ANY 
CHARACTERS WRITTEN ONTO CONSOLE. When I remove append and let console switch 
into 80x30, penguin is colored, but its background is white - not black and I 
can see characters written into console.
Could developer who will repair it send me patches and I'll tell him what 
happens.
Thanks a lot
Michal
