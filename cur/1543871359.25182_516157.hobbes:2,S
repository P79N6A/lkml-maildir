The gcc manual says nothing about alignment.  What it says is sizeof()
doesn't work.  If flexible array doesn't honor the alignment of the
declared type, it would be useless for its designed purpose of
supporting *array* of dynamically-determined length.

If kmemleak's container_of cannot deal with the current struct devres,
it means it can't deal with flexible arrays at all.  Flexible array
being the standard as opposed to 0 size array gcc extension, I guess a
lot of people would prefer flexible array.
It would be best if kmemleak's container_of can be modified to work with
flexible arrays.  If that's not possible, I guess it needs wider
discussion to determine whether to ditch flexible array for kmemleak.
Thanks.
