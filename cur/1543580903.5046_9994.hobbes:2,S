This was already discussed some days ago. Arjan said, that the
miropcm20 question comes before the aci question, so this is
useless. - Arjan, this is not true for 'make menuconfig' and 'make
xconfig', isn't it?
Anyway, this solution looks somewhat cleaner to me...
But you can choose on your own:  (:
As the new maintainer I'm offering the patches on
http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~Robert.Siemer/Private/
Jocelyn, as my patches also include bugfixes and enhancements
(especially for the miroSOUND pcm20 radio), can you recommend these to
the complaining people. - I want more testers and reports for my
patches...
Thanks,
	Robert
