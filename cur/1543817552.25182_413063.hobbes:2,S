I see. I wonder if TOC track (in 2KB sectors) longer than ISO image
is a (recording) bug.

Thanks but... now I've converted my last machine to PATA-libata and
drivers/ide are dead for me:
- no way to hot-swap (permanent modules)
- IRQ timeouts on my EPIA-M (never seen with libata)
- now the "end of medium" problems
- code duplication and different device names
