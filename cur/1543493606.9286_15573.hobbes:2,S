Apache should not use a seperate process for each HTTP request.
It ought to one of two things:
 - Use a thread to handle each request, all in one process.
   There is already an alpha pthreads Apache out there, but
   it's virulently unstable (I used it on OS/2, and it had
   SEGV/BUS errors almost nonstop). If you enjoy playing with
   threads, check it out.
 - Be event-driven rather than procedure-driven by using
   select(2) to serve files. (Obviously CGI scripts and anything
   hard to do in an event-driven manner can be done with a
   new spawned/forked process.)
Note that on *.BSD, Apache's process-intensiveness is not an
issue because *.BSD kernels can fork at a mind-boggling rate.
Cheers,
Joshua.
