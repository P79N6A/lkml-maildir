yeah. Although 'stuff goes async' is quite similar to a cachemiss. We 
didnt have some resource available right now so the syscall has to block 
== i.e. some cache was not available.

each indirect pointer has to be checked separately, before dereferencing 
it. (Andrew pointed out that they should be VERIFY_READ, i fixed that in 
my tree)
it looks a bit scary in C but the assembly code is very fast and quite 
straightforward.

get_user_pages() would have to be limited in some way - and i didnt want 
to add yet another wacky limit thing - so i just used the already 
existing mlock() infrastructure for this. If Oracle wants to set up a 10 
MB ringbuffer, they can set the PAM resource limits to 11 MB and still 
have enough stuff left. And i dont really expect GPG to start using 
syslets - just yet ;-)
a single page is enough for 1024 completion pointers - that's more than 
enough for most purposes - and the default mlock limit is 40K.
