Actually, I have no interest in the sound card except for the ide port. In at 
least one configuration, "modprobe sb" didn't produce errors, and that was 
without any hassling with pnp. Just for kicks, I just modprobed snd-sb16 and 
used sox's play to play a wav. the only relevant entry in dmesg was
pnp: Device 01:01.00 activated.
pthree:/tmp# cat /proc/asound/cards
0 [S16            ]: SB16 - Sound Blaster 16
                     Sound Blaster 16 at 0x220, irq 5, dma 1&5
thanks
Fred
