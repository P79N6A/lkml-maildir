Exactly.

The ultimate purpose (I thought) of the UIO driver is to simplify
driver development
by pushing device control into userspace.  There is a very real need
for efficient
dynamic control over the DMA allocation of a device.  Why not 'allow' this to
happen in userspace if it can be done safely and without breaking anything else?
Remember that for devices employing ring buffers it is not a question of
'how much memory a device has to offer' but rather 'how much system
memory would the
driver like to configure that device to use'.
I don't want to stop my DMA engine and reload the driver to create
more buffers (and I don't
want to pre-allocate more than I need as contingency).
Cheers,
