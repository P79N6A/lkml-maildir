NFS is already interruptible with umount -f (I use that all the time...), 
but softlockup won't know that and throw the warning anyways.

For the record I have no principle problem with syslets, just I do
consider them roughly equivalent in end result to a explicit retry based
AIO implementation.

Hmm. -ENOPARSE. Can you please clarify?

It's not universal suckage I would say, but sometimes unavoidable
conditions. Now it is better of course to have these all TASK_KILLABLE,
but then fixing that all in the kernel will probably a long term
project. I'm not arguing against that, just forcing it through
backtraces before even starting all that is probably not the right
strategy to do that.

After impacting the user base -- many of these conditions are infrequent
enough that we will likely only see them during real production. Throwing
warnings for lots of known cases is probably ok for a -mm kernel
(where users expect things lik that), but not a "release" (be it
Linus release or any kind of end user distribution) imho.
I don't think there is a real alternative to code audit first
(and someone doing all the work of fixing all these first)

I didn't write that, please reread my sentence.. 
But we seem to agree that a backtrace is something "declared bad" anyways,
which was my point.

That's better, but the backtrace is still there isn't it?
Anyways I think I could live with it a one liner warning (if it's
seriously rate limited etc.) and a sysctl to enable the backtraces;
off by default. Or if you prefer that record 
the backtrace always in a buffer and make it available somewhere in /proc
or /sys or /debug. Would that work for you?
