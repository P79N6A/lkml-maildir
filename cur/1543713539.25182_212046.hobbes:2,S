It would solve all these problems if there were a new version of glibc 
included, or headers for user mode, or something... but in the real 
world at the moment most people are dropping 2.6.x kernels and selected 
upgrades to tools onto 2.4 systems. And a lot of user tools don't work 
unless you use kernel headers. The most obnoxious example is cdrecord, 
which doesn't seem to use the ATAPI interface unless you have a 2.6 
kernel in /usr/src/linux, or at least the include files.
I'm not saying that the kernel should program around people who insist 
on doing things wrong, but there are programs which don't work right 
unless you use some kernel headers when building (right meaning on 2.6).

Unfortunately the sanctimonious "we told you not to do that" approach 
isn't helpful to the real problem, the 2.6 kernel doesn't exist in a 
vacuum, and at the moment some applications are built with kernel 
headers to get full functionality.

This purity of approach has only one failing, in some cases it doesn't work.
The useful answer is that you need to be *very* careful about which 
headers you use and not just use symlinks. There was a set of headers 
around which worked better with 2.6 and didn't have all these problems, 
I have solved my problems a case at a time, so I don't have the location 
handy.
Hope this actually helps, if you're going to bend the rules you have to 
understand how to do it. As O.P. found.
