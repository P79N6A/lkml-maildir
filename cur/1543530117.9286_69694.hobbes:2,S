I assume you are implicitly asking Viro's question.  The plan 9 folks did not
invent the term namespace, they used an already existing term from papers
previous to them.  I'd have to go look at my old thesis to find them, my advisor
made me read them because these papers propose namespace unity and use the term
namespace, not because they propose a particularly interesting syntax for doing
it.  I suppose I ought to be citing them on my web page.  As I define it, a name
is a means of selecting an object.  If you have something that resolves names, a
namespace is the mapping of names to objects, that the resolver embodies.  The
plan 9 use of the term namespace is a proper instantiation of the use of the
term namespace, but it is by no means the defining usage of the class of
namespaces.  
Best,
Hans
