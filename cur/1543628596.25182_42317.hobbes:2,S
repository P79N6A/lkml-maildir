We let users do much worse: rm -fr /
won't even warn you.  I'm all for warning the user, but since the
MTU issue can be worked around by setting the VLAN MTU to 1496,
and sometimes setting the eth0 MTU to 1504, then putting hard
restrictions in the kernel sounds like a really bad idea.

Wrong is a strong word for a change that makes it work for some people without
obvious negative side effects.  I can understand not putting the changes in
by default, but a module-load flag, or a compile time check is much easier
to support than telling the user to go patch their driver and come back when
they figure out how to do that...  It will also allow users to easily test
the patches on all their various systems.

That is good news, but does not change my arguments about fixing up
the eepro driver at all :)

I'm looking forward to Jeff's return.  I still haven't heard if he
ever figured out why 3 DFE-570-tx (4-port) tulip nics cannot exist
in the same system :)
