Subject: [2.6.8.1/x86] The kernel is _always_ compiled with -msoft-float

Why this kernel is always compiled with the FP emulation for x86?
This is the line from the beginning of arch/i386/Makefile:
CFLAGS += -pipe -msoft-float
And it's hardcoded, it does not depend on CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION.  So,
is this just a typo or not?
