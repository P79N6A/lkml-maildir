You are using qemu itself as the kernel loader instead of your
possible problematic grub on your harddisk. To duplicate the problem,
you need to manually copy your grub and the kernel to linux-0.2.img
and boot it with "qemu linux-0.2.img", although I am not sure
exactly how to manually do this. Another way is to know your
installation media that contains the copy of grub you are using,
and use it to do an installation in qemu.
