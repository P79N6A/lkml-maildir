I want to port a Network driver from kernel2.2.x to
2.4. Could anyone please point me a handy pointer
where i can find a complete documentation.
I could find some, but not the complete changes
required.
Also, Approximate time estimation for this migration
from an experienced developer would be much helpful.
Thanks in Advance,
Jalaja
