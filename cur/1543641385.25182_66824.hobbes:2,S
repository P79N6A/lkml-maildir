No.
The "policy input" has to filter down ALL THE WAY. If you turn it into a 
frequency-only input at _any_ time, you've lost information that the 
lowest levels need. 
THAT is the problem with the current #3 - it _assumes_ that the policy 
input has already been converted to frequency, and since it assumes that, 
it cannot handle the case where the hardware itself wants to know what the 
policy was.
