You're always going to have this.  For instance, the standard ISA serial
ports may not show up in any "enumerated stuff" on an x86 box - and x86
people expect that the port at 0x3f8 is ttyS0, 2f8 is ttyS1 etc.
Change that order and they'll scream at you.

See my previous mail why this doesn't work - x86 serial console
requirements.
I think you'll do better to discuss this problem with Alan so that
he can change his (and maybe others) points of view wrt when the
serial console is initialised.  Until then I'm going to continue
sitting on the fence on this point.
