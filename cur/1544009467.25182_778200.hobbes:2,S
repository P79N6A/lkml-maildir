There are a lot of people who are going to fundamentally
disagree with this, myself included.
A lot of things are being stated about what people do with this stuff,
but I think there are people working longer in this area who quite
possibly know a lot better.  But they were blindsided by this new work
instead of being consulted, which was pretty unnice.
