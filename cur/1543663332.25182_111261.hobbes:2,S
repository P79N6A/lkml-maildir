with the dot-marker it's not scaling badly at all - you can see the
numbers in the mail, all of the command variants (even a simple 'ps')  
still reads the _full_ /proc directory. (just they dont go further than
that, because the readdir() output is enough to filter stuff.)

Al says that this cannot be done sanely, and is fraught with security
problems. I'd vote for it if it were possible. Al?
but, if you worry about the scalability of large /proc directories - it's
not bad at all.
