greg this is part of my config
(we are talking now 2.6.22-rc4-200706042030-cfq7 #160 SMP PREEMPT Mon  
Jun 4 20:55:02 CDT 2007 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux)
CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS=y
# CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_CLASS is not set ---------------------
# CONFIG_USB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is not set
CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND=y
# CONFIG_USB_OTG is not set
i disabled libusual in my config
# CONFIG_USB_LIBUSUAL is not set
with libusual=y my usb-harddrives doesn't show up on desktop after  
boot until i cycle one off/on and from this moment all of them start  
showing up
with libusual not set -usb-harddrives shows up but this doesn't affect  
scanners
btw scanners are working with standard fc7 86-x64 kernel
