Yesterday, I got a major lockup with this patch. The system just
completely froze for more than 10 seconds. There was no mouse
movement, I could not switch workspaces.. nothing..
There was quite a bit of load. There were about 180 processes (up from
the normal 40-50) due to a number of procmail/sendmail pairs. I run
spamassassin so each of those processes was testing for spam apart
from my other tests. I was also actively browsing the web and
playing music. Thats about all that was going on. 
Unfortunately I could not get the numbers. Once it passed, everything
was perfectly back to normal. I have not been able to reproduce the
freeze because I have not got enough emails at one go to reproduce
that kind of load. If will try to capture the numbers next time round.
