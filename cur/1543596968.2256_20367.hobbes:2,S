The queue lengths should always be long enough to keep the hw busy of
course. And in addition, the bigger the queues the bigger the chance of
skipping seeks due to reordering. But don't worry, I've scaled the queue
lengths so I'm pretty sure that they are always on the safe side in
size.
It's pretty easy to test for yourself if you want, just change
QUEUE_NR_REQUESTS in blkdev.h. It's currently 8192, the request slots
are scaled down from this value. 8k will give you twice the amount of
slots that you have RAM in mb, ie 2048 on a 1gig machine.
block: queued sectors max/low 683554kB/552482kB, 2048 slots per queue
