I've tried 2.4.19 and a bunch of 2.4.20-pre on RH rawhide and 8.0 (same
gcc), smooth sailing throughout; and also 2.5.x, 39 <= x or something like
that, with glitches mostly due to work in progress only.

Have you reported that at 
http://bugzilla.redhat.com
? After triple-checking,
that is, I doubt it very much that RH builds their distribution kernels
with something other than the standard RH tools and configurations.
