Hi,
there are some function who are declared this way:
include/linux/cpuset.h:21
extern const cpumask_t cpuset_cpus_allowed(const struct task_struct *p);
I was wondering what means const for a function returns type.
K&R doesn't say anything about this and gcc-4 warns (warning: type
qualifiers ignored on function return type)
If it is a mistake, there are a few functions who should be modified.
Regards,
Benoit
