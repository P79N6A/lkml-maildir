I know you probably don't like the name, but all over the kernel people 
are using BUG() as ASSERT()... so why not create what people want?
IMO we should have ASSERT() and OHSHIT(), the latter being the true 
meaning and current implementation of BUG(), the former being used when 
the machine is still useable.
