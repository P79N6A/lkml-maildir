prolly ;) totally unrelated to this, but what about this:
Jun 24 20:46:01 codeman kernel: ISO 9660 Extensions: Microsoft Joliet Level 1
Jun 24 20:46:01 codeman kernel: Interleaved files not (yet) supported.
Jun 24 20:46:01 codeman kernel: File unit size != 0 for ISO file (60133376).
Jun 24 20:46:01 codeman kernel: ISOFS: changing to secondary root
Jun 24 20:46:01 codeman kernel: Interleaved files not (yet) supported.
Jun 24 20:46:01 codeman kernel: File unit size != 0 for ISO file (60135424).
It's a 4,5GB ISO, edited with Magic ISO Maker under Windows, saved it, burned 
it. Windows can handle the DVD very well. Linux just says the above and do not 
give me any listing of the DVD.
Do we ever get interleaved files support with linux?
ciao, Marc
