All of this problem does not seem to be gone with 2.3.8 either. I tried
to unzip one 400M zipped file and it produced a long sequence of
following messages to syslog:

Unzipping resulted an error due to CRC error. I tried to run unzip again
and kernel panic resulted, unfortunately it did not put any output to
/var/log/messages and I cant get any screen dump about it so I just try
to reproduce the problem.
