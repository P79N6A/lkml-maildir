if so, that would be a good explanation why it hangs.
- copy_process() checks for pending signals, then set retval =
-ERESTARTNOINTR and returns.
- handle_signal has the following code:
                        case -ERESTARTNOINTR:
                                regs->rax = regs->orig_rax;
                                regs->rip -= 2;
                                break;
looks like it will keep trying to reenter the syscall forever,
subtracting 2 from ip will restart the syscall. by some reason the
signal is never really handled.
