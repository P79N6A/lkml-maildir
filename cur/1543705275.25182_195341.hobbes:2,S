In years past, the mouse double-click for a single click syndrome was 
caused by the pushbutton switch in the mouse becoming unsoldered, as 
in a microscopic crack in the solder you had to use a strong glass to 
see around the switches pin in the puddle of solder.  Holding the 
switch solidly against the board and resoldering fixed it right up.
Not for folks who don't know which end of the soldering iron gets 
hot...
What was happening is that the switch would close and send the event, 
but the finger then pushed the switch down against the board anotheer 
thousandth, causeing the pin to rise slightly on the bottom of the 
board, breaking the solder connection, which sent that event as a 
button rise, and the situation was then reversed as the finger came 
back up, giving 2 full clicks for one push.
