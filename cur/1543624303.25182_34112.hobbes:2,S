I overlooked that in your patch you changed the index for the lookup, so
yes, that looks a better fix.

Lock are standard and we cannot change such API, but for a fairly new
API I'd prefer strict stuff. Anyways now -EPERM would be wrong and the
need of the errorback is also lower because there's no risk of
collisions anymore, now different current->files will be able to get
different notifiers, so if something it should be a -ENOENT, it's not a
matter of permissions/ownership anymore.
