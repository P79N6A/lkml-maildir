Yes it could.  I personally *NEED* the IDE patches.  That is NOT
good enough reason to include them in the mainstream kernel
however.
The 2.2.x IDE patches are unmaintained if I'm correct, unless
someone else has stepped up to maintain them.  Vojtech Pavlik
(sp?) is maintaining the VIA portion I believe.
If the IDE patch were integrated, it would likely fall upon Alan
to manage.
Also, if it were added, then we'd hear:  "Now that NFS V3, *and*
the IDE patches are in 2.2.18pre, could we *please* add the
(reiserfs | pick your favorite patch)"

Because it is unmaintained?  Once it is in the kernel, Alan will
be the one getting bug reports, so he should be the one to decide
ultimately.
