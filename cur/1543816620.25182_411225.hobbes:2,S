The IA64 virtualisation work (Xen and Linux-on-Linux) uses the SKI
simulator virtual scsi device --- which looks just like any other scsi
disk, but uses hypervisor calls to do read/write/open/close calls like
a user-mode process.  For performance, it needs to be extended a bit
to do asynchronous I/O and interrupt on completion.  As a halfway
house, the ski simscsi driver would be fairly easy to port, I think.
