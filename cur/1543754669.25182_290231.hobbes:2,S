If you would have looked inside mmap.c, you would have seen that his check
is executed *after* trying for a specific address if it was given. Mmapping
0x000b8000 should still work. I don't know if this patch was very clean (it
probably isn't) but what it's supposed to do is only fail if no specific
address has been given to it.

Oh come on. Every normal program checks whether a variable has been allocated
or not by comparing it to NULL. I have no knowledge of the internals of glibc
though, and wouldn't know whether this should be handled inside the kernel or
if having it checked in glibc and userspace programs that use mmap directly
should be enough, but AFAIK every C coder assumes that NULL pointers point to
nothing.
