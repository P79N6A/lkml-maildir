Might I suggest the term "operation environment" - thus things like the 
kernel, and "got-to-have-it-or-we-no-go" bits like libc and the dynamic 
loader system are "the operating system", and 
"we-can-live-without-it-but-who-wants-to" bits like the browser, editor, 
HTTP/FTP/etc. libraries are part of the "operating environment".

OT: Thank you, Richard, for what you've done for the industry. My first 
exposure to Gnu was on the Atari ST, where an individual sent me GCC on 
about 20 floppy disks. Been hooked ever since - I've often thought the 
GPL would make a great "Wonder of the World" in FreeCiv...
