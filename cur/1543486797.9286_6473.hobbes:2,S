With respect, I think you did. Compression rock, but is IMHO orthogonal to the
question. Many people who are short of space will be using e2compr anyway, and
compression won't gain them a thing.
Now, if you show that Bitmover files compress better than SCCS files, and that
the compressed size of a full Bitmover history is smaller than the compressed
size of a pruned SCCS history, that's different. 
But otherwise, you're comparing apples and oranges. Comparing uncompressed SCCS
files with compressed Bitmover files just isn't valid.
