Greetings linux-kernel;
I have a problem with my ESDI controller under Linux.  I decided it was
time to move my trusty 386sx with an OMTI 8627 ESDI controller and NEC D3661
disk (
http://theref.c3d.rl.af.mil/controllers/c_omti-8627.html
 and
http://theref.c3d.rl.af.mil/hard_drives/h_nec_d3661.html
) to Linux.
So, I booted up the Debian 2.0.36 install disk.  It didn't find my hard disk.
Consulting the HOWTO, I found that the only mention of OMTI controllers was
as 8-bit XT controllers; this controller is a 16-bit controller.  Regardless,
I tried using the suggested xd=8,5,0x320,3 to force OMTI controller
recognition.  No luck.
Does anyone have any suggestions what boot flags or kernel would be best to
recognize such a controller and drive?  Or do I just have to go back to VSTa
which handled the controller just fine (presumably through the BIOS) or do
some coding?
David.
