Note that there's a chip erratum (#4 I think) on the AMD-756 that
makes it handle lowspeed devices wrong ... AMD told me I'd need
an NDA to learn their workaround, and I've not pursued it.  (Does
anyone already know what kind of NDA they use?)

These are symptoms of that erratum.  Don't plug lowspeed devices
(like, probably, your mouse) into the root hub ... something about
that makes some of the registers read wrong.   Like telling you
that you've got 242 downstream ports.  At least this time it was
a clearly bogus value.
Since the second register read was correct, I've sometimes thought
maybe it'd work better if you just redefined readl() to do each read
twice ... might be worth the experiment, since you have the hardware.

Something went wrong ... :-)  Hard to say who without
at least a stacktrace.
