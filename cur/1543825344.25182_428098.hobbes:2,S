They shouldn't interfere as which scheduler to use is a boot time 
selection and only one scheduler is in force.  It's mainly a coding 
matter and in particular whether the "scheduler driver" interface would 
need to be modified or whether your scheduler can be implemented using 
the current interface.

It uses the standard run queue structure with per scheduler 
modifications (via a union) to handle the different ways that the 
schedulers manage priority arrays (so yes).  As I said it restricts 
itself to scheduling matters within each run queue and leaves the wider 
aspects to the normal code.
At first guess, it sounds like adding your scheduler could be as simple 
as taking a copy of ingosched.c (which is the implementation of the 
standard scheduler within PlugSched) and then making your modifications. 
  You could probably even share the same run queue components but 
there's nothing to stop you adding new ones.
Each scheduler can also have its own per task data via a union in the 
task struct.

Depends on the scheduler.

OK.  I'm waiting for the next -mm kernel before I make the next release.

No, I actually use the gquilt GUI wrapper for quilt 
<
http://freshmeat.net/projects/gquilt/>
 and, although I've modified it 
to use a generic interface to the underlying patch management system 
(a.k.a. back end), I haven't yet modified it to use Stacked GIT as a 
back end.  I have thought about it and it was the primary motivation for 
adding the generic interface but I ran out of enthusiasm.

Making quilt easier to use is why I wrote gquilt :-)
