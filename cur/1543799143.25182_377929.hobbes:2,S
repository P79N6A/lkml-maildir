It's not a READ either!
Yes I'm being stubborn, but my point stands. I'm not changing something
that is perfectly valid, "just because". If it finds a bug (you
mentioned ide-cd, I still want the details on that when you have the
time), then it's all for the better since it would bite us for other
paths as well.
In summary - it's not a bug, it doesn't need fixing.
