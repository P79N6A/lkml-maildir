There are some refreshing comments in "The Mythical Man Month" by Brooks.
While not all the truth is found there, it shows some issues and at least shows
that it is a complex issue and not all the issues are instantaniously obvious.
Maybe we are just trying to get a too large bite of features done at the same
time.

Ah, like Debian for instance... if you drift for too long you get the bad
press for NOT saying anything.

In principle yes, but I think that there should be some mechanism along with
that which forces releases somewhat more frequent. If we say a date we can
feel guilty for not deliver on time and use that to bang people in the head
and say "No, not in this release" where as we would loos that and be able to
put up some other way of forcing a release even if the hacker in us wants more
into it. Smaller steps. Maybe one should open up a new development path as one
say "freeze" on the current so that one can redirect requests for the next
development tree and have those efforts start early in the branch.
Regardless of what we say, I think we must figure out how to increase release
frequency while maintaining the quality level. I'd say go for smaller steps
in additional features and get those in early so that stabilization may occur.
It's a balance and there will allways be opinions on the release times.
Cheers,
Magnus
