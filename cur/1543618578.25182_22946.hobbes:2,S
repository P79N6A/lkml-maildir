I have an ASUS A7V motherboard, similar to your ASUS A7V133.  I find
that stock kernel (2.4.18-pre7) APM powers off the machine, but stock
kernel ACPI does not.  However, the Intel ACPI patch, available from
http://developer.intel.com/technology/IAPC/acpi/downloads.htm
 against
kernel 2.4.16, does power down my machine.  I was able to forward port
this to 2.4.18-pre7 without too much trouble by starting with 2.4.16,
applying the Intel ACPI patch first, and then applying kernel
patch-2.4.17 and kernel patch-2.4.18-pre7.
As to the merits of the amd_disconnect patch that started this thread,
under 2.4.18-pre7-acpi, I get an idle CPU temperature of about 48 C.
With the amd_disconnect patch, it drops to 32-35 C, wow!  As
previously discussed, APM + amd_disconnect on an Athlon does not
provide any power savings, one needs ACPI + amd_disconnect.
Note that on this motherboard (and perhaps all ASUS Via chipset
motherboards, including the A7V133), one needs the following line in
/etc/sensors.conf to get reasonable lm_sensors CPU temperatures:
  compute temp2 @*2, @/2
This is as described at 
http://www2.lm-sensors.nu/~lm78/support.html
in Ticket 775.
Best wishes,
Wayne
