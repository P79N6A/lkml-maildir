Yes, all that stuff appeared in -test12, IIRC.
Now ARM port uses it too, BTW.

What is why I leave VGAs and all sorts of bridges enabled.
If you have some other type of console sitting on the PCI
bus you need this enabled as well, of course.

Or let pci_do_scan_bus() check the FBB capability of all
devices on the given bus and then arch code will decide whether
enable FBB or not on the bus controller.
Anyway, new member in struct pci_bus makes a sense.

I'm afraid I don't understand how that could affect hppa. PCI-to-PCI
bridge specification allows PCI-PCI bridge to have some device-specific
IO, MEM or ROM resources. If any of these are present, we must allocate
them properly.

Oh, well. That code actually initializes limits of the bridge
windows with the values of the root bus to make a room for
resource allocation. I can't recall now why it was placed in the
arch code. Maybe one of the reasons was that I wasn't sure whether
someone want to use prefetchable memory...

You mean something like this (moving code from arch/alpha to generic)?

Certainly all this should be cleaned up in 2.5; I'm not sure for 2.4.
