With these two patch both DVD-RW and DVD+RW works !!! Thanks you very much, it's a dream coming true.
It seems that DVD+RW works better (it's faster) with packet device than with direct writing (mounting /dev/hdc).
When I'll get back to work (on September) I'll test your patch with USB 2 device and another DVD writer.
