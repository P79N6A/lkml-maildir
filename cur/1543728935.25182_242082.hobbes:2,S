Very odd. Why do you see a problem with the page_table_lock but no 
problem from the mmap semaphore?
The page fault codepath acquires both.
How often is the page table lock acquired per page fault? Just once or 
multiple spin_lock calls per page fault? Is the problem contention or 
cache line trashing?
Do you have profile/lockmeter output? Is the down_read() in 
do_page_fault() a hot spot, too?
