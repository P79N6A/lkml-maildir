That's a little strong.  "Misleading" I could understand, but "false"?  
Isn't the distinction between a kernel thread and a user task pretty 
clear-cut (except for a few borderline cases which aren't at issue just 
now)?

How will that help?  Block the kernel thread in the freezer or block it 
in the driver -- either way it is blocked.  So how do your deadlocks 
get resolved?

I disagree with your analysis -- not that it's completely wrong, but it 
points out an existing basic problem in the kernel.  The kernel should 
never depend on userspace!  More correctly, a task executing in the 
kernel should never block with any sort of mutex or other lock held (in 
a way that would preclude it from being frozen, let's say) while 
waiting for a response from userspace.
Then the dependency graph would be easy to construct: User tasks can
depend on whatever they want, and kernel threads never depend on a user
task.
If this contradicts the existing implementations and APIs for userspace 
filesystems, then so be it.  My conclusion would be that the 
implementations and APIs should be changed.

It _does_ apply to kernel threads.  That's exactly why I wrote above 
that kernel threads which try to do I/O during a suspend will need 
extra attention.
