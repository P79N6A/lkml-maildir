If you have hotplug enabled, I think you'll see an 'online' file that 
you can echo 1 or 0 into, somewhere in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0 for 
example.  It should work even on machines where it doesn't actually 
power down the slot (it'll just remove it from the online map, and it 
won't get scheduled on, etc.); at least it did last time I tested it.
