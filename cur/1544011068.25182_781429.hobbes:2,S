We've talked to kernel team people from Fedora, Ubuntu, and SUSE so far. 
Fedora 8, 9, and 10, Debian sid, and Ubuntu jaunty are currently shipping 
packages for the standalone version of Ksplice.
We haven't yet made a big push for end-users--that's still ahead.  We've 
submitted the code now because we think that it's important to try to 
involve the community sooner rather than later.
