I don't know of anyone who has contacted the authors yet.  I haven't
had the time, since I'm currently travelling at the moment.

/dev/urandom is a cryptographic RNG, which is seeded from RNG.
/dev/random uses a very similar cryptographic RNG, but it uses large
pool to collect entropy, and uses an entropy estimator to limit the
amount of data that can be extracted from the rng.  
If the entropy estimator fails, /dev/random degrades to a
cryptographic RNG.  So it is not a disaster, whereas the approach
described in this paper (which uses a non-cryptographic extractor)
would seem to me to be *more* prone to catastrophically failure if the
entropy estimator fails than /dev/random.
As to whether or not applications should be using /dev/random or
/dev/urandom, /dev/random is no worse than /dev/urandom, as long as
the application doesn't mind blocking when the entropy levels are too
low.  In practice, most of the time this situation doesn't arise since
the appropriate way of using /dev/random is only to extract a small
amount of entropy when needed to generate long-term keys, or when
seeding a userspace cryptographic RNG for session keys.
