Hello, there is a little problem with some headers and
new glibs and compilers. Kernel fails to compile and worst
is the extern declaration in sched.h
Don't if this is a gcc or glib problem (surely gcc) but doesn't
works...
The patch is only redeclaring xtime in extern:

I made it with the copy that joe editor does, you know the change is:
-extern volatile struct timeval xtime __attribute__ ((aligned (16)));
+extern struct timeval xtime;
There are other problems with multiline string literals all over the
code
but this is only a warning... One is this...
/mnt/hd2/src/linux-2.4.5/include/asm/checksum.h:72:30: warning:
multi-line string literals are deprecated
Hope it helps. It's a ridiculous patch but now it's fixed.
Thanks
