One of our Fedora users reported a bug that showed up
with spinlock debugging enabled.
sound/pci/es1968.c: es1968_measure_clock()
At line 1811, we acquire &chip->reg_lock
and then call snd_es1968_bob_inc(), which
calls snd_es1968_bob_start(), which tries to
acquire the same lock at line 885.
It barfs as a result.  Is it safe to move
the snd_es1968_bob_inc() call before we
take the lock ?
