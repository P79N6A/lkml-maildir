Andi, This patch fixes two critical issues. One is the memory leak that 
can happen in syscall32_setup_pages because of a malicious app and 
another is the 32bit hugetlb application failure(which was also observed 
by a customer recently). More details are in my changeset comments.
Either we need to fix these issues independently for 2.6.12 or address
the issue globally(fixing all the corner cases).
thanks,
suresh
