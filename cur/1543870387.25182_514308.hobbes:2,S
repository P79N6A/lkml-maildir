Hi,
after switching to libata on my old Dell notebook, I get a 30 seconds
long delay during boot. If I remove the CDROM the boot process is as
fast as with the old ide driver.
Boot with cdrom:

My notebook has a PIIX4 controller:
IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01)
This happens with all libata enabled kernels including the latest git
snapshot (2.6.21-rc2).
Can anyone shed some light on this?
Thanks,
Gregor
PS: As far as I remember this cdrom was blacklisted for DMA or
whatever reasons in early Linux 2.6 kernels.
