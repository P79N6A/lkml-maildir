Also related to ACPI, a patch went in recently that prevents some boxes (at
least mine) to power off properly via ACPI. The patch is:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdif
f;h=cee5dab4856f51c5cad3aecc630ad0a4d2217a85
As the commit log says, this was somewhat expected. I sent a message a
couple of days ago both to the list and to Eric W. Biederman, with no
response so far. Message Subject: is:
[2.6.12-git8] ACPI shutdown fails to power off machine
