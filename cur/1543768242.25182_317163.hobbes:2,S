My understanding of the operation of the TLAN interface is:
	The driver is initiated and starts autonegotiation (TLan_PhyStartLink).
	At some point later autonegotiation completes (TLan_PhyFinishAutoNeg) and the link becomes active (TLan_FinishReset).
	In TLan_FinishReset TLAN_NET_CMD is set based on TLAN_NET_CMD_NRESET, TLAN_NET_CMD_NWRAP and whether the link is half/full duplex.
	The TLAN_NET_CMD in TLan_FinishReset does not take account of the original state of TLAN_NET_CMD in particular the state of TLAN_NET_CMD_CAF.
This means that if the interface is set to promiscuous mode during the time between initiation and the completion of autonegotiation, the interface will revert to non-promiscuous mode when the link becomes active.
Similarly if autonegotiation restarts (cable disconnected, network goes down) and then the link becomes active again, the promiscuous setting will be lost.
As you say, the problem manifests itself if the ethernet bridging module is being used and is initiated as part of the kernel start up process since bridging operation requires all of the slave interfaces to operate in promiscuous mode.
To solve this problem I think that the TLAN_NET_CMD setting in TLan_FinishReset should depend on the promiscuous flag.  The first few lines of TLan_FinishReset should become something like:
        phy = priv->phy[priv->phyNum];
        data = TLAN_NET_CMD_NRESET | TLAN_NET_CMD_NWRAP;
        if ( priv->tlanFullDuplex ) {
                data |= TLAN_NET_CMD_DUPLEX;
        }
        if ( dev->flags & IFF_PROMISC ) {		/* new test for promiscuous flag */
                data |= TLAN_NET_CMD_CAF;		/* OR in tlans's promiscuity mode bit */
        }
        TLan_DioWrite8( dev->base_addr, TLAN_NET_CMD, data );
