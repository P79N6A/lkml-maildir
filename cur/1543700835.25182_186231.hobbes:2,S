Well, its inclusion do not mean you have to use it - you have to
physically walk all the classes in /sys to get udev to create the nodes,
as they are already there when booted.  And as the code is only a few
lines for each device, it is not much overhead to get:
1) a full sysfs tree of all physical and 'virtual' (?) devices.
2) Optional feature to generate /dev with one simple script for those
   that want it, which should be the less complex option at initramfs
   time.

With an already populated /dev, sure :/
