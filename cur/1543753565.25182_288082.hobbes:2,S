Well, there's 3 classes of stuff:
1) Stuff that's basically independent of RBAC (a lot of randomization stuff,
for instance). These can go as a separate stream.
2) Stuff that is mostly independent of RBAC, but can use it for configuration
and control.  So for instance, the PAX stuff (which by itself is close to half
the whole thing) could go in, and possibly with a "stub" patch that adds
control via /proc/kernel/something or a /sys entry.  And it's *OK* if your
code has a "shim" in it to make patch 3 work until the new infrastructure
that patch 27 adds shows up, meaning that patch 26 removes a big chunk of
patch 3 (especially if your /sys shim stands on its own even without patch 27).
3) The stuff that literally makes *no* sense if you don't have RBAC.
It may very well make sense to attack the stuff in group (1) *first*, because
then (a) all the kernel users get the benefits (similar to the "non-exec-stack"
patch from execshield - everybody wins from that piece even though it's not all
of the package), and (b) it's an easy way to pile up street creds by demonstrating
with small patches that you are with the program - when some of the later, more
contentious patches show up, it helps if you're recognized as the guy who
already sent in 10-15 patches...

Well - what parts of RBAC *can* be done inside the LSM framework?
What parts could be done inside LSM if LSM gained another hook or two (there
*is* precedent for adding a hook for things that can reasonably use it)?
What parts can't be done inside LSM, and why?

I agree that the sum set of features eventually included needs to cover
all the bases - the big hurdle is factoring it down into patches that stand
a chance.
