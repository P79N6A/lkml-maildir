it's not a bug, it's simply the fact that git (properly) uses it's own port for 
it's own protocol, and not all firewalls allow access to that port. in some 
cases even where a person would have the ability to get the firewall changed 
they may not want to for other (political) reasons.
even if git tunneled over HTTP there would be firewalls that would require 
authentication that git wouldn't be able to do and would therefor block the 
access.
