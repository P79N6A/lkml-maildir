I didn't :) The driver is loaded, lsmod shows it, but no sign of scsi
changer in /proc/devices. It's all OK that it isn't working since from
the source it seems that the driver is written for 2.0 and early 2.1
kernels. Is it hard to port this kind of module to 2.2? (with a bit of
C knowledge, but without any idea on kernel internals). If someone
with more knowledge could help, I can give access to the machine with
the tape changer on it.
