Ah, when the structure has many instances padding should be reduced, you mean. 
But well, I think slab itself adds some padding to separate instances, for 
this effect and for cache colouring (I guess that means to prevent too many 
different things from being allocated on addresses matching on the low-order 
bits, so that inserting one in the cache means evicting another of the two - 
it's something I guessed when I studied set-associative caches).

Making L1_CACHE_SHIFT_MAX and L1_CACHE_SHIFT match, right? Or forcing all 
architectures to support something like X86_GENERIC?
Also, 
#define L1_CACHE_BYTES  (1 << L1_CACHE_SHIFT)
should probably be made general, while at it.
