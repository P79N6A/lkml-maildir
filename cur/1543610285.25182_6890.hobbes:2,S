   I am building an NWFS module external of the kernel tree, and unless make
   dep
   has been run, the default behavior of the includes causes me to drop into
   the
   BUG() trap.
When you change configuration options, you have to run make
dep again, that is a known requirement of the 2.4.x build system
like it or not :-)
