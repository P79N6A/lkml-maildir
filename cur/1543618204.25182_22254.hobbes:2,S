It may be also a compiler related problem, so the version of the compiler is
also important. Some newer gcc don't inline memcpy/memset if complete
structures or arrays are assigned. For example:
char x[4] = {0,};
result in a memset, if here is no define of memset in any header it will
give an undefined symbol. Earlier gcc use buildin inline versions of memset
for this. Its a long discussion with gcc people, what is is the correct way
( I don't know the end of this discussion).
