Its an old driver, it doesn't follow the coding style too well at all -
viz stuff like if (! ( the line above. Given its age and limited userbase
I don't plan to go and make it conform either, but I will take patches
for the formatting (and the spelling errors it is full of) from someone
who wants to do the work.
