I have installed Linux 2.2.9 (with an ATM patch 0.59) on a Dell 450 MHz
Pentium. I have 2 ATM interfaces (and 1 ethernet interface). Both ATM
interfaces have been configured to work with IP and are doing fine.
I want to configure the IP stack in Linux so that when I ping from 1 atm
interface (atm0) to the other atm interface (atm1), the ICMP packet actually
goes out of interface 1 (atm0). Though the ping responds correctly, I find
that no ICMP packet has actually gone out of the interface (which I can
verify from an analyzer). Is there an easy was to configure IP, may be by
using some compile time flag that I can actually see the ICMP packet go out
of the interface? I am trying to look into /usr/src/linux/ipv4/icmp.c and
/usr/src/linux/ipv4/route.c.
I would like not just ICMP but any IP datagram actually going out of
interface 1 when it is sent via IP to interface 2 on the same host
Thank you and warm regards.
