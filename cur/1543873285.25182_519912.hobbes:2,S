actually, even for 'cutting edge' testers, the number of 32-bit x86 
systems outnumber the number of 64-bit test-systems by a factor of 5. 
For distributions with real users, the ratio is closer to 1:10...
so i typically get bugs reported on 32-bit first, and for 64-bit it is 
usually only reported if the bug is 64-bit /only/. That basic property 
is true for both upstream, -rt and rawhide kernels.
Andi's x86 merge tree /does/ break quite often on 32-bit, but that's not 
really due to testers, that's due to Andi being primarily the 64-bit 
maintainer ;)
