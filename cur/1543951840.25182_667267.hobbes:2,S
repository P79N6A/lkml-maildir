Oh, that would be such a shame.  Your guest page hinting patches remind
me of that childhood thrill, when once a year the circus comes to town ;)
But seriously, I'm ashamed to see my name in the Cc list: it would
be very unfair if your patches never made it in, just because I've
failed to find the time to wrap my own puny brain around them.
It's very encouraging to see Jeremy and Rusty weighing in.  I hope
Zach will too, and I've added Andrea: their support would count a lot.
You have Nick on the list, good, I've added Christoph and Peter
(if you do resend, linux-mm might prove more useful than linux-kernel).
With support from rival virtualizers,
I do think you've a good chance of getting in.
