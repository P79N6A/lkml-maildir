Do you have the numbers for VIA C3/C7 around?
The Geode benefits from movntq instead of movq:
[marcelo@localhost ~]$ cat /proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : Geode by NSC
cpu family      : 5
model           : 5
model name      : Geode(TM) Integrated Processor by National Semi
stepping        : 2
