Good point.
Somebody should really look at "dma_set_fragment", and see whether we can
make "min_fragment" be really just a hardware minimum chunk size, but use
other heuristics like frequency to cut off the minimum size (ie just do
something like
	/* We want to limit it to 1024 Hz */
	min_bytes = freq*channel*bytes_per_channel >> 10;
Although I'm not sure we _have_ the frequency at that point: somebody
might set the fragment size first, and the frequency later.
Maybe the best thing to do is to educate the people who write the sound
apps for Linux (somebody was complaining about "esd" triggering this, for
example).
