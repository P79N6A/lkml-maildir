there is at least one technical reason to need more than one: certain
types of storage (both big EMC boxes as well as solid state disks)
don't behave like disks and have no seek penalty; any cpu time spent on
avoiding seeks is wasted on those, so for these devices one really
wants to use a different IO scheduler, one which is much lighter weight
