Jamie,
The nearest I could tell from what I saw was that Caldera got a bad
binary or mismatched GLIB/LIBC5 objects when they did the 2.4 build. 
When I rebuilt glib and egcs under GLIB 2.0 it went away.  I can
recreate it reliably from the OpenLinux 2.4 CD.  Here's the current
versions on their CDROM that cause this problem.  The Linux kernel is
2.2.15.
binutils-2.9.5.0.16-1.i386
glibc-2.1.2-3.i386
glib-1.2.6-1.i386
egcs-2.91.66-5.i386
I did upgrade to a modutils version not shipped with OpenLinux 2.4, but
I hardly think this is the problem.  I upgraded modutils since modules
won't load on 2.4.0 without at least this version:
modutils-2.3.10
:-)
