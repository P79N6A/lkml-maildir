Correct. The releasing thread may keep running.

Wrong.
The spec says that the mutex must be given to a waiter (if any) at the
moment of release.  The waiter don't have to be scheduled at that
point, it may keep sleeping with its freshly unlocked mutex.  So the
unlocking thread may continue - but if it tries to reaquire the mutex
it will find the mutex taken and go to sleep at that point. Then other
processes will schedule, and at some time the one now owning the mutex
will wake up and do its work.

Good point, except it is a strange program that do this.  Lock the mutex 
once,
do 100 operations, then unlock is the better way. :-)
