Err, you are right. But this brings a new idea to my mind: why don't we use
s_umount to prevent umounting while we prune one dentry? Something like:
  if (down_read_trylock()) {
    if (s_root)
      prune_one_dentry()
    up_read()
  }
  // else just skip it
So maybe our prunes counter isn't the only way to go. Comments?
Regards,
