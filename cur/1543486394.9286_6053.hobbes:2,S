Yep! First make a big swap partition or a big swap file. There is, roughly
4096 bytes of memory required for every megabyte of file-system space when
you execute mkfs.ext2. This depends upon the allocation-unit size, but
it's a reasonable rule-of-thumb.
Then boot into single-user mode with no network daemons running. Make
sure your swap partition is activated, then make the file-system. You
should be sucessful.
Cheers,
