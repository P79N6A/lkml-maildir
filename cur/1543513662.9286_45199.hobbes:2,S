You've got more core - I was testing the sucker with 8Mb. Fit hits the
shan as soon as it tries to swap. It looks like add_page_to_inode_queue
is called with inode->i_pages.next==NULL.
Oh, crap! I got it. Now, who came up with that swapper_inode thing? It's
not initialized, it... arrrgh. OK, quick and dirty fix follows (warning:
it's cut'n'paste, so TABs can be mungled...)

	Folks, could you check if it fixes the rest of problems? It _is_
the source of pagemap.h:102 one. However, I _don't_ think that it's the
right solution. Leaving the thing in will give us new rounds of the same
stuff in the future... What was the motivation behind this thing?
