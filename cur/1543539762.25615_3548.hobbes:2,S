Then the exploit should get fixed. There are many bad things that
can happen as a result of an exploit, and frying your hard drive is
one of them. It can still be done even if your patch is in the kernel.
That makes your patch irrelevant.
This *is* an issue though. A hardware issue. You need to use your
voting power to get the hard drive manufacturers to reject invalid
or RESERVED commands, and also get them to require a jumper
setting before allowing write access to the firmware.
