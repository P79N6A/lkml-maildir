This patch series adds support for the touchscreen controllers found in
WM97xx devices.  This revision of the patch series fixes a race when a
pen up interrupt occurs while the touchscreen is being polled for input
and adds support for use of pen down interrupts with non-accelerated
reads.
These changes are also available in the git repository at:
