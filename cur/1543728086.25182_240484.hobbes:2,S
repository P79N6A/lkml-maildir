OK I've reverted the most suspect change 
(remove-unconditional-pci-acpi-irq-routing.patch) and it did not fix the 
problem. As Karol Kozimor suspected ACPI, I then tried with acpi=off and 
then it boot but I will burn my CPU as fans are ACPI controlled...
So it is probably due to the bk-acpi.patch and more precisely the 
difference between what was in 2.6.8-rc3-mm1 and 2.6.8-rc4-mm1.
Len, any proposal as candidate patches to revert?
