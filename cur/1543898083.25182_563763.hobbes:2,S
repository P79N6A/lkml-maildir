    I'm going to shortly post the patches blacklisting the drive and using the 
proper HPT36x enablebits (as much as this stupid design may be fixed :-)...
Please test.

    Note that for the hpt366.c driver, this is also achievable by setting 
HPT366_ALLOW_ATA66_[34] to 0 and recompiling. It will limit its UltraDMA 
capabilities to modes 2 or 3.
