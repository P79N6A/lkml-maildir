I was just making suggestions after a 30s thinking. Side comments, 
readding this mailling list, I had the impression that journaling and 
filesystem performance do not seem to mix well. Also on server, you have 
probably extra backup hardware and means (e.g RAID, DAT, DLT, ...)

Personnaly, I dislike this approach as it as resulted in 2.4 being non 
usable for servers (SMP deadlocks, IO stalls, unresponsiveness for 
several seconds, ...) and laptop (ACPI)...

If 2.4 kernel is not usable without patching, It is far worse for me...
