hey, why not just implement it, as a proof of concept
and see, what is broken, and what can be fixed ...
maybe your concept has a big fute, ... give it a try!
on the other hand, if you want somebody to implement
this stuff for you, you'll have to provide convincing
arguments for it, I for example, would be glad if
hardlinks where removed from unix altogether ...
