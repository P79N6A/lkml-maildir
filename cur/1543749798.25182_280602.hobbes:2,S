Surely must be shl %esi,%ecx

Same.
Haven't tested.
But for the one instruction it seems overkill to me to have a new
function. How about you just extend clear_page with the order argument?
BTW I think Andrea has been playing with prezeroing on x86 and
he found no benefit at all. So it's doubtful it makes any sense
on x86/x86-64.
