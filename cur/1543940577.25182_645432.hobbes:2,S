Ok. I believe I see what problem you are trying to fix.  That
a pid returned from find_pid might disappear if we are not rcu
protected.
This patch in the simplest form is wrong because it is confusing.
We currently appear to have two options.
1) Force all pid hash table access and pid accesses that
   do not get a count to be covered under rcu_read_lock.
2) To modify the locking requirements for free_pid to require
   the tasklist_lock.
   However this second approach is horribly brittle, as it
   will break if we ever have intermediate entries in the
   hash table protected by pidmap_lock.
Using the tasklist_lock to still guarantee we see the list, the entire
list, and exactly the list for proper implementation of kill to
process groups and sessions still seems sane.
So let's just remove the guarantee of find_pid being usable with
just the tasklist_lock held.
