This could be the problem I was talking about. Was this happening during 
spindown or not?

I guess so. They all oops on reading the same address (0x05c2a5bb), 
there's something corrupted in the slab cache, cause unknown. Very 
possibly fglrx.

...while still experiencing corruption?

Hmmmm. This means that you could still be experiencing the same thing 
that Andrea Gelmini was reporting. Could you try the things he said made 
it worse, and check if things go wrong? You are, of course, allowed to 
decline because of the risk involved. :-) The things are:
Big activity:
* iozone -A
* unrar big file
* In order to make it happen faster:
	cd /proc/sys/vm
	echo 100 > dirty_background_ratio
	echo 1000000 > dirty_expire_centisecs
	echo 100 > dirty_ratio
	echo 1000000 > dirty_writeback_centisecs
