You are so cleanly isolating and cutting away of a group of developers.
I sincerely hope your fellow developers will not cut you off if you
make a similar mistake. I know mine wont.
What you are saying is, a Copyright violation done by someone else is
Somebody Else's Problem (tm). There are a couple of issues with this point
of view:
First, these developers got questionable advice from senior Linux kernel
developers, and SLFC (which is closely related to FSF) in the process.
There have been complete silence from the leaders of their own
community (Linux Kernel developers, FSF, ...) all perhaps used your
argument to convince themselves that this is not their problem.
However, from an outsider point of view, this lack of silence means
an agreement to something that is ethically and legally wrong.
Furthermore, this is a case about collaboration and cooperation
between GPL and BSD developers. I believe they share some common goals
related to freedom and improvement of Open Source software.
This case illustrates some important issues that should interest ALL
free software developers:
1) How tricky code sharing between different projects can be even when
   intents and goals are pretty much alike.
2) MANY developers on BOTH sides have NO clue about the  laws and ethics
   associated with handling Copyrights and Licenses.
3) The copyrights and licenses are the foundations of our work.
   We put out great usually volunteer work, to create and improve.
   The licenses specify the terms and conditions under which we allow
   our work to be used. When we allow ANY license violation to occur,
   it affects our own work, regardless of the license on it.

This has been done. Really. They have been contacted privately
before the issue became public. Got no results. The issue is then made
public,
with the results you see now. This is no longer a MadWifi problem.

Sometimes inaction is wrong.
In case of the OpenBSD Broadcom driver using parts of the GPL driver
which was
under construction and prematurely committed to a public repository, NONE
of the OpenBSD developers argued for what was done. It was illegal, and
the driver was removed immediately.
What was being debated was the approach. The OpenBSD project or the
developer
was NOT contacted privately. The issue was made public immediately, with all
the flame fest that followed.

It is fair. All license issues deserve utmost attention and respect by
all communities. If we let such issues to go unresolved, we face a
much greater danger to our work.
Please note that this is NOT a revenge, as some obviously think it to be.
We take our copyrights most seriously. We contacted MadWifi privately, they
did not heed our requests. We made the issue public, some senior Linux
Developers said "so what is the issue".   We trusted Eben from SLFC to set
things straight, and waited for a resolution. They instead give the
developers
questionable legal advice, and do not respond to our valid inquiries and
objections.
Is it too naive to hope that some leader/senior developer from the
Linux/FSF/GNU
whatever will take the clue stick and let the developers know what is
happening
is wrong. Being leaders in a community do have some responsibilities you
know.

*WE* the OpenBSD people *DO NOT* want you to "fix the problem". We want you
to be aware of the issues, and react responsibly. A response from the
leaders
of their own community would have a MUCH GREATER impact in ending the
discussion
and ending all the trolling.
But it appears, disowning them is a much convenient solution for most
"leaders".

I repeat, you do NOT have to be in control of a project to take action.
The silence means you are fine with copyright violations. It means that if,
for some reason, we stopped (or did not start) yelling, then you would
let it be.
Licenses are important and must be respected. The communities would not *be*
otherwise.
