	I have this same problem with segfaulting and locks.
I did get this in the log once tho before a hang.
Jan 12 15:51:37 ghost kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer
dereference at virtual address 00000004 
Jan 12 15:51:37 ghost kernel: *pde = 00000000 
Jan 12 15:51:37 ghost last message repeated 2 times
Jan 12 15:51:38 ghost gpm[142]: oops() invoked from gpm.c(147)
Jan 12 15:51:38 ghost gpm[142]: /dev/vc/0: Input/output error
I also had it hang once when doing a ls on the dev dir aswell.
I am using devfs with debug and auto mount.
Ld seems to mess with it too, it hung twice in a row when
making the piggy.o on a make bzImage, on the pre3-ac3
kernel. Third time it went without a problem. Thought this might help.
