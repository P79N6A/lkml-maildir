Oops!  I did it!  It appears that PIT interrupt requests are somehow
involved in the NMI generation.  Since the high-res-timers patch
programs the PIT to interrupt once at the end of each PIT interrupt, it
stops interrupting if the interrupt system is off.  At least this
appears to be the problem.  Now if someone could explain just how this
is done, or at least point me to the the appropriate documentation...
So, sorry for the noise, but still, I think the patch below is a good
thing(tm).
