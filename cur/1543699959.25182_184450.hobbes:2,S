Ok, this looks sane to me.
However, I have a totally independent question: do new PCI Express host
bridges really not just suppor the old PCI config access interface?
Quite frankly, if I was a manager in charge of a PCI Express host bridge,
and it didn't support the old C8C IO access patterns, I'd be so ashamed of
myself that I'd kill my whole development team with rat poison, and then
blame them for the mistake(*).
Do we know of any sudden suspicious death waves inside certain groups at
Intel?
