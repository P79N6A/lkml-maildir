OK, this is something in procps.  I checked /proc/xxx/cpu for
this process (and a trivial while (1) ; loop) and the first line
records very close to 100 * real seconds. i.e. over 90 seconds,
the process recorded 9018 ticks.  (finger jitter :-)
So I can only assume that top (and ps) are dividing the total
cpu time for the process by 2 (number of cpus?).
Cheers,
Stephen
