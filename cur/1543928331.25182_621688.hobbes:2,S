That's a common misconception about open source software:
There is nothing like a "right of choice".
There is a "right to change the source code".
This means you cannot demand from anyone to offer any choices, but you 
can fork the code yourself and use and distribute modified code 
containing any choices you consider reasonable.

That's wrong.
It's actually often much worse to have different choices with different 
features and bugfixes than having one version that contains all features 
and all bugfixes.
