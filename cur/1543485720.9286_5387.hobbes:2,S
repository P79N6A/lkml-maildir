What is the situation re persistent data?
There was one attempt to provide a built-in database service for a
module
to write items at unload time and reload at load time. Or one can
consider
post-install and pre-remove for doing this but we do not have a standard
recommened way for this. We probably need a standard
	/proc/module/<module_name>/*
format that one can read/write to maintain continuity of service for
the module.
I assume here that I do want the module to be unloaded/loaded and
not lose any settings (that maybe my post-install used, or my
application)
thus allowing transparent unload/reload, so idle-unloads carry far
less risk.
