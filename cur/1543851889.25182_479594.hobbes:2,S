Yes, of course, milliseconds.  I have enough other problems with this
program (measured in minutes, and no mistake that) that I doubt I'll
be profiling the kernel any time soon, but thank you for your help.
More than anything else, you've made me understand that I can't just
fire off a bunch of async requests like I'm tossing peanuts across the
table.  I've really got to pay attention to what's in that kernel
queue and how it gets managed.
