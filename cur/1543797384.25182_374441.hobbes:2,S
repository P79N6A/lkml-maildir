Ok, I went digging further and found the c3tsc selection is correct on
your hardware. I'm just too used to my own laptop where the TSC varies
with cpu speed and we lower the rating value. So that should be ok.
I'm now working on why we mis-compensate the c3tsc clocksource in the
-RT tree. 
As for the "sleep 1" bit, I'm not sure yet. This behavior does not
change with the clocksources does it?
