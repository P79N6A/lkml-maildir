Suppose you have two vehicles, an economy car and a semi truck. The truck
can go everyplace the car can go, and the truck can carry a bigger load. So
why would you ever use the car? Answer: The car uses less gas and you don't
always need a truck.
Think about what it takes to be able to copy one block of memory to another
location when those locations might overlap. You don't always need that.
