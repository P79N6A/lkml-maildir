Hmm.. It does make sense, but at the same time, sparse isn't even really 
supposed to _care_ about the architecture. Especially not for a kernel 
build.
Which part breaks when not just using the native sparse? As far as I know, 
a kernel build should use all-kernel header files, with the exception of 
"stdarg.h" which I thought was also architecture-independent (but hey, 
maybe I'm just a retard, and am wrong).
