If by FAT you mean FAT16, then yes, you have an 8 GB limit for the 
entire filesystem.  Fat32 on the other hand, can handle much more and so 
should be suitable in this aspect.  Fragmentation is also a property not 
of the filesystem, but of Microsoft's filesystem drivers.  I'm fairly 
sure that the linux fat implementations do not use absurdly stupid 
allocation algorithms that lead to lots of fragmentation.

This can be overcome with the UDF filesystem by using the uid and gid 
mount options, allowing the files to appear to be owned by the correct 
local user.  It would be nice if the other filesystems were patched to 
allow such options as well.

Network filesystems are not on disk filesystems, so they have nothing to 
do with this discussion; you can't format a disk as "nfs" or "smb".

I agree.  I recently submitted a patch fixing a bug in the udf 
filesystem so it correctly uses the uid and gid mount options to 
translate the ownership of files owned on disc by id -1 to the values 
you specify.  It would be nice if you could also specify that should be 
done for all files, not just those owned by nobody, and if all 
filesystems allowed you to do this.
