Jeff, you seem to have proven once more that you live in a fantasy world
that has its own private rules of physics, ethics and rule of law. 
While this appears to be a dangerous phenomenon, it is fortunately a
relatively rare one.
Linus has been intentionally, deliberately and maliciously lied to,
smeared and mislead for more than 1.5 years. Linus has not mislead
anyone, let alone lied to anyone. The so-called 'contamination'
accusations that you repeated are just that: unfounded accusations. A
simple question: do you know the concept of "truth"? Another simple
question: do you even care about it? In the world i live SCO owes Linus
more than just a simple apology. I personally find it admirable that the
only thing Linus expects of SCO is a simple apology.
(it is your free choice to join SCO's ranks but it is really not Linus'
fault that whenever it comes to Novell you apparently tick out and start
behaving seemingly irrationally. You should not fault him for happening
to be in the line of fire of your apparent personal vendetta against
Novell.)
(it is also your free choice to rewrite any part of Linux as long as you
respect the license. You are not the first one and you will not be the
last one trying. Good luck with it.)
