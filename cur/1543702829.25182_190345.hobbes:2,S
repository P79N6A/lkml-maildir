I can well see your reticence in view of the situation, I think I'd be 
gun-shy too.  Its called prudence.
However, since I've been running 2.6.1-mm1 here, using the rivafb with 
an elderly gforce2-mx2 32 megger, I've noted that when running 
kde-3.1.1a with 8 windows, and a couple of them have multimegabyte 
backdrops, the biggest one being that famous deep space shot from 
hubble of about 4 or 5 months back.  In any other kernel, switching 
to that window took about 12 seconds for the backdrop to be converted 
to 1600x1200x32 and drawn the first time and about 8 seconds for the 
next time.  But with this 2.6.1-mm1 kernel, that repeat window switch 
is so close to instant that I cannot see it being drawn.
So as far as I'm concerned, this particular set of fb patches to 
rivafb *need* to stay in mainline.  I'd sure appreciate it, a bunch.
This ones a winner I think.
