I do know your brave intentions, only you are heading in the wrong direction.
Simple thing is: the more you split off new trees the fewer testing they will
get. This is simply because only very (read VERY) few people run different
trees (kernels) every day on their boxes. They decide for _one_ tree and try to
stay there. Simply because most people want to do something useful besides the
testing. So they cannot go and reboot their machines 20 times a day only to
know which patch of what tree looks like being "the right thing(tm)" for them.
Forget that.
So the more trees you spin off the fewer testing your mainline will get, _and_
the lower the pressure will be to make the needed patches work in the mainline.
The people needing good working SMP/VM/name-one will go and use -aa -rmap
-name-one instead, because they believe they have no other chance _right now_.
And they won't come back that easy.
The only thing that can be done against this phenomenon is to speed up mainline
patch release and make it _reliable_. This is why I made the suggestion
(elsewhere) to release a -pre every week on the same weekday. People will know
when the next one comes in. They have a plan, it is reliable.
Another very good reason is: the steps between the -pres are smaller, so there
is less risk for a complete failure or a mis-direction of certain development
steps.
And again this is a good argument for Marcelo needing more time for
maintenance, more releases = more time.

This is no real solution. There are already maintainers for big and small parts
of the kernel. The simple truth is: there are quite a lot of parts, and there
is no way around the fact that one person (the lines maintainer) has to keep
it all together somehow - and you need time to do that. This _is_ a really
important job.
Sh*t, I do not really want to initiate major discussion about this whole issue,
as I do believe that most of the story is clear to most of the people, and
after all it is a tech mailing list. We could talk for years with no productive
outcome ever.
