Part of the problem of supporting slave/device DMA along side generic
memcpy/xor/memset acceleration is that it adds a number of caveats and
restrictions to the interface.  One idea is to create another client
layer, similar to async_tx, that can handle the architecture specific
address, bus, and device pairing restrictions.  In other words make
device-dma a superset of the generic offload capabilities and move it
to its own channel management layer.

Should this patch wait until the framework has been extended?
