As far as we can tell, this alone does not stop the kernel from loading 
stuff at the addresses we need.  Even without PT_GNU_STACK ld-linux.so.2 
and libc are loaded below 0x01000000, which is the region that Wine 
assumes is free.  I think this may be due to prelinking...
We (Codeweavers) build Wine on a Redhat 6.2 based machine, so 
PT_GNU_STACK is not added to the binaries.  They still don't work on 
Fedora Core 1.

 From the Wine project's POV, there are two problems with that solution:
1) it's not backwards compatible with older binaries
2) it's distribution specific, so other distributions could come up
    with a new method of doing the same thing.

The first thing we knew about exec-shield was when stuff started 
breaking. Perhaps we could work a little more closely when there's a 
possibility that Wine could break due to a new kernel feature?
Ideally the solution to the problem should be backward compatible, and 
not require any change to older binaries for them to work.

It would be better to argue that with Alexandre Julliard, because he's 
the guy that chooses the solutions.  My guess is for the reasons I 
explained above.
