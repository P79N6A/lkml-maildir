Hi Roman & lkml.
I have digged up a serie of patches I had for scripts/lxdialog.
The net result of the patches are much nicer look in a text-only console
(that is with no X running). Also the code becomes in some places
almost readable, using Lindent is just one part of the cure.
Description of the individual patches:
[xxx] Lindent of scripts/lxdialog (patch not posted)
[1/7] fixup after Lindent
[2/7] make lxdialog sparse clean
[3/7] introduce a common helper to simplify printing the title
[4/7] left align the menu lines
[5/7] fix indention on text-only consoles
[6/7] make menubox.c more readable using a single macro
[7/7] truncate long menu lines
All patches are pushed to the kbuild repository at kernel.org:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sam/kbuild.git
Patched will follow as reply to this mail
This is not strictly kbuild stuff but using this repository the patches will
hit -mm for wider testing.
	Sam
