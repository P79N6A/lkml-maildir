Rik all we need to do now is convert the swapout code to address space
methods just like the block device was.
This has a number of interesting effects.  One of which is that
brw_page should no longer have any users.  Simplifying fs/buffer.c
Further this is equivalent to mounting a nfs file loop back which
the address space methods now allow, but it is more direct.  
Which means that if this reveals any bugs in nfs/lock ups in nfs they
were already there.
This has been on my want to do list for a while but I'm busy
reinventing booting so I haven't gotten to it.
