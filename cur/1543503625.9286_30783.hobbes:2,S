Hi Linux-Net Gurus,
I have a question about MTU setting while connecting host.
Actually I can change MTU size on the fly using ifconfig like
ifconfig ppp0 mtu 4096
but I'm not sure if it really changed peer MTU size. My understanding
is MTU and MRU size are determined during LCP negotiation so
once peer has been established both sides use the MTU and MRU.
However, since I was able to change MTU using ifconfig I changed
some values and better performance than default.
My guess is MTU size change by ifconfig won't change the REAL MTU
but it changes buffer size of transmit/receive for serial driver.
I briefly looked into ifconfig and kernel code and concluded above
but I could very misunderstanding of this. Could anyone explain
this? RFC's only say MTU and MRU during LCP.
Any comments would be appliciated.
Happy Linuxing,
