Hello everyone,
I encountered some problems on /dev/hda1 ext2 file system.
I've never had problems like this on this machine before.
Everything was running fine except that I noticed syslog(ing) functions were
running really slow.
After looking around a bit more and couldn't find anything else I rebooted
and /dev/hda1 came up with errors which I fixed using fsck. And everything
is fine now.
