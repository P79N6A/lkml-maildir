Hi Larry
Hi Everyone
To me it looks like lot's of users (and myself) simply want to track the 
kernel development very closely.
Some are looking out for a specific bug to be fixed.
Some want to see the direction of some developments going on.
The first place a change arrives at is the bitkeeper repository.
There are others who already have an idea to contribute.
They will already know what the pros and cons of bitkeeper are, or soon find 
out.
Do you think it is possible to make a split licence that will distinguish 
between active changes and passive watching/tracking ?
The web interface does not provide the functionality for a quick overview 
about the latest changes.
It may be sufficient for a part of the people in this discussion.
Regards
Gerold
