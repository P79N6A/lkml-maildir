The tests in www.cyberus.ca/~hadi/247-res/ were done with 4-port znyx
cards using 2.4.7.
What kind of problems are you having? Maybe i can help.

My point is that the API exists. Driver owners could use it; this
discussion seems to have at least helped to point in the existence of the
API. Alexey had the hardware flow control in there since 2.1.x .., us
that at least. In my opinion, Ingos patch is radical enough to be allowed
in when we are approaching stability. And it is a lazy way of solving the
problem
