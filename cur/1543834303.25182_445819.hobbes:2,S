Yes, I hoover up unloved patches from the mailing list.  But only from this
mailing list, and there are probably lots of potentially-useful patches on
other lists which get lost.
However I have a personal i-dont-do-typo-patches policy.  Resending them to
kernel-janitor-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net would be a good idea.
