Thanks to everyone that tried out btrfs.  Most of those that did managed
to hit problems with apps that did writes via mmap.  So, I added a
page_mkwrite call and worked out cow safe mmap writes.  
Terje Røsten sent along a btrfsprogs patch so that it compiles properly
on FC7 (thanks!).
I'll have a site up on oss.oracle.com/projects with mailing lists and
links to my HG trees shortly.  Until then:
http://oss.oracle.com/~mason/btrfs/
 has the latest tar balls.
