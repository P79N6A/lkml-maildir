I also point out that using ioremap for PIO adds flexibility while
keeping most drivers relatively unchanged.  Everyone uses a base address
anyway, so whether its obtained directly (address from PCI BAR) or
indirectly (via ioremap), you already store it and use it.
Further, code lacking ioremap for PIO (100% of PIO code, at present)
does not require a flag day.  Drivers can be transitioned as foreign
arches start supporting ioremap for PIO... if ioremap is no-op on x86,
drivers continue to work on x86 before and after the update.  Assuming a
stored not hardcoded base address (common case), the only change to a
driver is in probe and remove, nowhere else.
