(So, I take it that you *don't* lock your bike up, as poor security is
worse than none?)
While I believe you, I'd love to see references as it doesn't match my
day-to-day experience with Win/Mac end-users over the past ten years.

I have no trouble believing that.

'Inappropriate risks' nowadays is surfing the web and opening up mail
attachments that claim to be movies of dancing bears. I'd argue that
users have a reasonable expectation that these are things that should
'just work,' and be safe, much as normal humans have an expectation
that their car isn't going to explode when they turn the ignition.
Perfect is the enemy of good, or words to that effect, right? My point
is that requiring perfection out of a security framework is a bar
that's going to be awfully difficult to reach (and when it supposedly
has been achieved, as in SELinux, mere mortals find it too troublesome
to run with as it's far too difficult to configure). Security can and
should be done in layers, and what one may miss, another may catch.
