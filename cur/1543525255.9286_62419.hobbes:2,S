Just think:  This could have been you.  There but for the grace of God go I. 
  This is highly amusing, but it's about as germain as the virus warning I 
sent out (and got HUNDREDS of flames about(I'm still not talking to you 
limey, and you know who you are)) so I'm wondering - could this be taken 
elsewhere?

(Who is very sorry about that Virii warning email, please stop flaming me)
