As somebody else already asked: Where is that source?

Then why do you claim the license of the proprietary portions is GPL?

As far as you know. Can we assume you didn't bother to check?

"Repetitive messages". The way you did it, there are no messages at all.
If you had wanted to avoid repetitive messages, you could have
 - asked on linux-kernel to not output further warnings if the kernel is
   already tainted
 - given at least one module a non-GPL MODULE_LICENSE.
So you are nothing but a liar caught red-handed. And such a bad liar at that.

Let me translate that.
"Linuxant has willfully screwed kernel developers. If they want Linuxant
to stop, they first have to do the following things: [long list]"
Since your modules are out there, we need a way to mark them as
proprietary. My patch did exactly that and nothing else.
