Every single IP130 I've had my hands on has had an EEPROM that the
Linux driver declared bad.
I'm afraid that it's not the board that's at fault, it's the driver.
The NICs are working perfectly.
(Also, it seems mighty odd to refuse to drive the hardware based on an
EEPROM checksum failure, when the e100 driver will happily load for a
device where for example IRQ routing is broken.  Just another
indication that erroring out in this situation is overkill.)
