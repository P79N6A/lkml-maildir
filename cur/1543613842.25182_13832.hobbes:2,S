Just a thought that popped into my head..
What about using some kind of BugTrack system for this?
Where people can report a bug, and file patches for them.
There would indeed be some situations where 2-3-4 maybe
more patches are filed to fix one bug. Then the maintainer
can easily look through the patches and descide what to use..
