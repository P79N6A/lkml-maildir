Hi,
Context switch happens when one of your running processes (or kernel 
threads) is running and then makes a request (like reading from a device 
and it has to wait for result). therefore scheduler selects another 
runnable process/kthread to run.
If you think you have a lot of context switches, you might want to 
redesign your thread so it blocks less (for example, make several 
requests for reading several blocks, all at the same time, and wait for 
first to complete where there is higher probability for the rest of 
blocks to be ready when you check for their readiness).
regards,
Masoud
