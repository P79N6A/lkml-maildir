Happy New Year, all.
I haven't seen anyone reportings this so I thought I'd
better so it myself.
I get these messages from syslogd quite frequently and
they seem to have the same values all the time.
kernel: schedule_timeout: wrong timeout value f3333335 from c012ce3a
I use 2.1.132 #2 Wed Dec 23 02:52:36 MET 1998 i586
compiled with gcc-2.7.2.3
Hope this helps someone to fix whatever is wrong.
Regards Bosse
