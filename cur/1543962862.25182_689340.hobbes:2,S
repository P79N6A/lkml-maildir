Serge,
I posted a fix to Dave Miller which was included in net-2.6 and merged 
in 2.6.26-rc1.

This one should fix your problem for sysfs.
There is another fix to do in order to avoid name conflicts with network 
interfaces belonging to different namespaces, eg. allows to rename 
veth1234 to eth0 without conflicting with the network device belonging 
in init_net, I send this patch to container@ first to have it merged 
with the sysfs patchset.
Thanks,
