You misunderstand the intent. A 386 or 486 kernel will run on a Pentium
and could therefore hit the error. A PPro kernel would die earlier
anyway. Of course its long been PPRO|Athlon|... and the ifdef wanted
updating. I'd ifdef it on CONFIG_X86_FOOF_BUG and put the FOOF thing
into arch/i386/Config.in nicely with the other stuff
