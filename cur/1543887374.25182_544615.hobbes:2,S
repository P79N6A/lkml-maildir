Yes, as a long-term average. However, that is impossible to do in the
short-term. Some taks has to run first and some task has to run last.
Whatever task runs last has had no CPU for all the time the other tasks were
running.

The thing you're missing is that you are jumping into the middle of a system
that operates based on history. You are assuming concurrent creation of ten
tasks with no history and that for some reason the first task gets to run
for 20 milliseconds. The scheduler has to compensate for that past or it's
not fair.

This is the scheduler making up for the assumed past that you got you into
this situation. It cannot simply predict a perfect distribution and apply it
because when it chooses how much CPU time to give process 2, it has no idea
how many processes will be ready to run when it chooses how much CPU time to
give process 10.

What is that unfairness? That if there are 10 processes that want to run,
all things being equal, someone has to go first and someone has to go last?
That over a very short period of time, one process gets 100% of the CPU and
the others get none?
Yes. This fundamental unfairness is in every scheduler. The issue is what
you do to make up for this and create long-term fairness.

Same with every scheduler. It's fair over periods of time significantly
longer than the context switch interval.

You have to long over a longer period of time and taking into account that
the scheduler also has to compensate for past inequities.
