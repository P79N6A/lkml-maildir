Hi, we've got a problem in one of Linus' trees and it has started to
propagate around.  I need your help to track it down and fix it.
Please run the following script on your Linux BK trees and contact
me if it tells you to do so.  You can fix up the tree by doing the
following (warning: takes lots and lots of CPU time so if you don't
need the tree it may well be faster to reclone tomorrow after I finish
fixing the trees on bkbits).
cp SCCS/s.ChangeSet .		# save it just in case
bk checksum -vf ChangeSet	# takes ~15 minutes on 1Ghz K7
The set of trees which I know are bad on bkbits are:
    gkernel/main
    linus/linux-2.5
    linux-isdn/linux-2.5.export
    linuxvm/linus-2.5
    ppc/for-linus-ppc64
Here's the script, the usage is
	sh SH list of roots of the trees
------------ cut here and store in SH ------------------
#!/bin/sh
test -z "$1" && {
	echo "Usage: $0 repo [repo repo...]"
	exit 0
}

do	cd $HERE
	test -f $tree/SCCS/s.ChangeSet || continue

		# echo Skipping $tree because ID does not match
		continue
