Subject: usb issue in 2.6 or notebook defect?

Hello again!
Now I am trying to recover what is possible to a usb hard disk.
I tried to dd or tar the data, but after some time it stops.
(dmesg attached).
On another host the usb hard disk can be read without any problems.
Both hosts are running Linux 2.6.2. 
Now my question is: Is it possible that not even the first harddisk is
broken, but something from the notebook? Although I remember that
reading usb disks (either adapted 2.5" notebook hard disks or usb
sticks) never went very well (even on my old Acer or the Test-Toshiba
reading and writing much data failed).
So is this a kernel USB issue or a hardware issue?
In any case, can you give me some hints howto find the source of errors?
Greetings.
Nico Schottelius
