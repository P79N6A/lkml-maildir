Sorry, I don't understand: which "test" do you mean?
I did the bisect as per the bisect log and then just rebooted. Which gave 
me no usable results yet. I'm trying to boot 2.6.25-rc1 in a few moments 
and see if the hang is there as well. If it is, I'll start bisecting again 
and hope that "halfway between -rc1 and .24" will be a bootable kernel 
this time...
The "error" I'm trying to chase is a system "hang", but no instant lockup. 
I can reproduce this by increasing disk I/O. I did this primarily with 
rsync from different filesystems to my backup XFS partition. After a few 
minutes, the INFO: messages[0] appeared.
Thanks,
Christian.
