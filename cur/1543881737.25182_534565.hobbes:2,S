I saw from the mail
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.2/0936.html
 that it
is devpts_pty_new() that creates the appropriate enteries in /dev/pts,
but I just can not see how it do this.
and I also find
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9807.3/1172.html
saying that 
"The device nodes in /dev/pts can be automatically generated by the
devpts virtual filesystem".
Could someone explain how the enteries in /dev/pts/ is created?
Thanks a lot.
Regards
