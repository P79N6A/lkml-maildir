Okay.  The following Kconfig illustrates what I claim to be a bug.
config A
	bool "This is A"
	select B
config B
	bool "This is B"
	# Or, depends C=y
	depends C
config C
	bool "This is C"
Running oldconfig will give:
This is A (A) [N/y] (NEW) y
This is C (C) [N/y] (NEW) n
...
And in .config:
CONFIG_A=y
CONFIG_B=y
# CONFIG_C is not set
I claim that this should in fact be:
CONFIG_A=y
CONFIG_B=y
CONFIG_C=y
