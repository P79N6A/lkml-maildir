No.  Soft updates give you a form of asynchronous write ordering, but
that just means that the problems you get on unexpected reboot are
predictable for fsck to recover, not that there are no inconsistencies
at all.

I'm currently working on proper journaling (ie. no fsck required at all
after unexpected reboot) for ext2.
