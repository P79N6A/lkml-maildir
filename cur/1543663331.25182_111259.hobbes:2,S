I have made a patch that enabled that feature which I posted some
time ago. I'm reworking it for the moment, awaiting a few pending
kbuild changes + I need to put a bit more work in the script.
Last version posted had problems with oprofile and xfs - and
I do not think ia64 will build with current version.
Expect something to show up within a few weeks.
