Hi,
Could this IRQ problem account for this bug as well, please? Or is yours strictly a 2.6.19.x
issue?
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7847
I have a dual P4 Xeon box (HT enabled) so there is a lot of scope for IRQ migration. I was playing
WoW when this bug occurred, so there would have been a lot of IRQs needing handling between both
the video and sound cards.
Cheers,
Chris
