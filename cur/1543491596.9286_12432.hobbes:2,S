Subject: [PATCH] 2.2.5 - O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW erroneously opens non-directories
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Dear Linus,
  Enclosed is a bug fix for 2.2.5.
  The open() flag O_DIRECTORY is supposed to refuse to open
  non-directories.  However due to a logic error, with O_NOFOLLOW it will
  open files and other things.
  O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW is not such a weird combination.  In fact it's
  the only conceivable use for O_DIRECTORY since you can use a trailing
  slash instead if you want the link-following behaviour.
  Patch, thoroughly tested, enclosed.
Enjoy,
-- Jamie
