yep, this is possible, but i dont think it's anything new. It's already
(and was always) possible (and more generic) to do this with the following
method (with any scheduler): create 10 CLONE_PID threads which
'roundrobin' execute the same code, with a very simple user-space
scheduler executed out of a SIGALARM signal handler. Only one thread is
executing at a time. A thread executes only for 2 timeslices (alarm clock
set to 1), and switches over to another thread to continue with the same
register set. 9 threads will be 'candidates for recalculation', and
timeslices are 'pumped' into the COE. No special timing necessery, and
'success' is guaranteed.
you can abuse any but the most anal schedulers if you are allowed to run
multiple processes/threads. On systems where this could be a problem
strict resource (process) limits and CPU time accounting and monitoring
should be used.
