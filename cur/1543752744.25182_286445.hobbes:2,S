Nothing is set in stone.  I wont even look at code until Ingo or Linus 
rules on this. Ingo has expressed interest in SCHED_ISO on a previous 
thread with me.

To answer your question, the second of my proposals was to not have a 
separate scheduling class at all. To let normal users set SCHED_FIFO and 
SCHED_RR, possibly with all their priorities intact, but for there to be 
limits placed on their usage of these classes. The reason I suggested 
not supporting priorities is that proper real time scheduling would 
entail being able to say "I need x cycles, to complete by y time and I 
can or cannot be preempted". With these QoS requirements, a whole new 
scheduling style (EDF) would need to be implemented. Without actually 
implementing this, if you set a limit of cpu to 70%, all it takes is one 
FIFO process to run long enough at high enough priority and all your 
other soft real time tasks go to SCHED_NORMAL, which is nothing like 
what happens with true RT scheduling. Forcing all soft RT threads to 
round robin at the same priority would make them sort themselves out. 
It's a compromise either way, and in fact this latter way is what OSX 
does and works well in practice as well as theory.
