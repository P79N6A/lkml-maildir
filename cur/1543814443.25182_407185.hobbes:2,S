Heh. We relaxed the "needs PG_reserved" requirement, but there's a comment 
that still says that it needs to in the internal function, which used to 
be shared between remap_pfn_range and vm_insert_page.
And it uses page_add_file_rmap(), which is misnamed (but that has nothing 
to do with vm_insert_page). 
page_add_file_rmap() doesn't actually do any rmap stuff, it's required for 
_any_ page that is mapped, and in particular pages that are _not_ rmapped. 
So vm_insert_page() is doing the right thing, but it looks a bit scary due 
to bad naming else-where.
