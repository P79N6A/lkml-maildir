Hi Matthew,
Thanks for the reply.
I can store the returned dma_addr from
pci_map_sg/single or pci_map_page in a driver
structure.
struct page *page =
virt_to_page(Cmnd->request_buffer);
                unsigned long offset = ((unsigned
long)Cmnd->request_buffer &
                                        ~PAGE_MASK);
                dma_addr_t busaddr =
pci_map_page(hostdata->pci_dev,
page, offset,
Cmnd->request_bufflen,
scsi_to_pci_dma_dir(Cmnd->sc_data_direction));
But how do I convert this returned "busaddr" into a
virtual addr?
regards,
Anil
