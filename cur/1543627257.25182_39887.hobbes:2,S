Hi,
When switching using a KVM switch I loose keyboard (only in Linux so it's not 
hardware related)
I'm using a ADDERView KVM switch (used to connect multiple PC's to one key / 
mouse / screen).  After looking on the internet I have found lots of other 
users having the same problem, with other KVM switches.
This happens both in console as in X.  Keyboard and mouse I use are both PS/2.
Using Linux version: 2.4.18-6mdk (gcc version 2.96 20000731)
I think anything else is pretty irrelavant.
Kind regards,
Stijn Verrept.
BTW Can I get any feedback on this?
