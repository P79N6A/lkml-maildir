I wanted to check a CD image an did the following :
mount -t iso9660 -o ro,loop filename /loop
/loop exist on the local machine
with filename=cdimage the mount went ok
with filename=/remote/cdimage the mount gave errors
/remote is a directory on another machine
cdimage is a correct CD image 
I understand that I'm trying to do something unusual , but could 
someone on the list explain the reason why it works only with local 
files
Thank you to all of you
