My preference too.  There could be a separate effort for that.
egrep -r --include=*.[ch] "KERN_[A-Z]*[[:space:]]+\"\\\n" * | wc -l
104
These are either errors or a desire to prettify logs with
vertical whitespace.  I think vertical whitespace doesn't help.

printk KERN_<level>s were sometimes bolted on after code was written.
etherfoo_card_init()
{
	printk(KERN_INFO "etherfoo card");
	slot = foo_getslot();
	if (slot < 0) {
		printk("\n" KERN_ERR "etherfoo card slot not found\n");
		return -1;
	}
	printk(" found in slot %d", slot);
	irq = foo_getirq();
	if (irq < 0) {
		printk("\n" KERN_ERR "etherfoo card irq not found\n");
		return -1;
	}
	printk(" with irq %d\n", irq);
}
Sometimes, a KERN_ERR is misplaced, or the "\n" is missing.
	printk(KERN_ERR "\n" msg);
or
	printk(KERN_ERR msg);
To me, the card announcement printk should move to the
end of the card_init routine and just be a single printk.
etherfoo_card_init()
{
	slot = foo_getslot();
	if (slot < 0) {
		printk(KERN_ERR "etherfoo card slot not found\n");
		return -1;
	}
	irq = foo_getirq();
	if (irq < 0) {
		printk(KERN_ERR "etherfoo card irq not found\n");
		return -1;
	}
	printk(KERN_INFO "etherfoo card in slot %d with irq %d\n",
	       slot, irq);
}
