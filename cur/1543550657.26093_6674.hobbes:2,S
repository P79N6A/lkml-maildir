This is what i have in one of our webservers (dual p3 512MB) configuration
(in rc.local):
echo "65536" > /proc/sys/fs/file-max
echo "262144" > /proc/sys/fs/inode-max
echo "10240 61000" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
echo "134217728" > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
echo 300 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time
As i've read and been told the inode-max should be atleast file-max*3, but
as you see i have it four times higher.
My system seems to be very stable, and i know i have overdimensioned
everything :)
