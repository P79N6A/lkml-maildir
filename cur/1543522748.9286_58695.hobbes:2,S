	Actually, I do.  I helped get the Computone-II Multiport serial
card drivers into the Linux kernel.  Computone does make an MCA card.
The decision was up for grabs whether to support the MCA card.  We decided
not to.  I put it on my web site under things we weren't going to support
along with the question "does anyone really care?"  I have yet to hear
a single peep.  The board exists and is in production.  It is not supported
under Linux like it's ISA or PCI brethren.

	MCA was a good idea for it's time.  I worked on several cards
designed for MCA.  Too bad IBM decided to make it an example where
intellectual property trumps good idea and destroys it.
