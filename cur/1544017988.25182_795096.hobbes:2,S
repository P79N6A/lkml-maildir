Yeah, we are not completely out of the woods.  But it's getting
better.  The code is still pretty clear, the major bug is fixed and we
even managed to get the race window for false wake ups pretty small.
Isn't that great? :)

Hm, this would require the lock bit to be set without someone else
doing the wakeup.  How could this happen?
I could think of wake_up_page() happening BEFORE clear_bit_unlock()
and we have to be on the front of the waitqueue.  Then we are already
running, the wake up is a nop, the !test_bit() is false and noone
wakes up the next real contender.
But the wake up side uses a smp barrier after clearing the bit, so if
the bit is not cleared we can expect a wake up, no?
Or do we still need a read-side barrier before the test bit?  Damned
coherency...
