but, release_task() is a delayed thing for exactly this reason. It fills
out the per-CPU task_cache but does not free the task.
the release_task() + schedule() must be atomic though - ie. we must not be
preempted anytime inbetween [because that other task could free the
task_cache] - but i wasnt running with CONFIG_PREEMPT, so i cannot see how
it could happen.
