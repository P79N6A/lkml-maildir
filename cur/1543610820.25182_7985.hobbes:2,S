Define "long while"... Here RAID-0 is working fine. Admittedly the file 
server is still on kernel 2.4.10-pre14 (+ some patches) but I can't be 
bothered to reboot it to install a new kernel (uptime is growing nicely...).
When you simulate not working component of RAID-0 by marking it as such in 
/etc/raidtab it works fine for me. I know because I used it when installing 
the second disk and creating several RAID-0 arrays on my file server on the 
new disk then copying the data accross, marking the old disk partitions as 
the other working half of the raid arrays and letting md driver synchronize 
them without any problems at all... I did a lot of raidstart/stops at that 
time too without problems.

Hm, I should try 2.4.16 some time to see if it breaks here...
