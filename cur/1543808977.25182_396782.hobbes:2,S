That's not really enough, is it?  What if you suspend, unplug your usb
flash drive, plug it into your camera, take a few pictures, plug it back
into the camera, then resume?
If you don't throw away the old mount, that sounds equivalent to
allowing writes to /dev/hda1 while it has a local filesystem mounted on
it.  There may be limits to what you can do to prevent that in this
case, but it seems best to err on the side of caution.
