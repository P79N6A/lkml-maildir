Hi,
> I am using *sendto* function to send a RIP packet.
> It is working fine when I send a packet to a particular destination ( like
192.168.163.132 with subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 ) but when I am trying to
send a broadcast packet ( i.e. setting the destination IP address to
192.168.163.255 ) it is giving me an error message " Permission denied ".
> Is there any way to set the permissions.
>Any pointers?
  Thanx
  Regards
