What fud?  I stand by my claim - I have tried to do the same thing for
-mm and found that I didn't have guts for that; too much work.  For mainline
I do cross-builds for allmodconfig on a *lot* more targets than what you've
mentioned and generally it stays within ~150-200Kb of patches, about half
of that being a fix for 8390 mess.
_IF_ somebody wants to do that for -mm, yell and you are more than welcome
to all infrastructure, except for the cycles on build box I'm using.
Incidentally, it is a box at work - my energy bill is high enough as it
is, without adding an 8-way 3GHz iamd64 to it...
The last time I've attempted that for -mm was this summer; right now mainline
is quite enough work, TYVM...  Especially since I use the same tree as a
staging point for annotations and watch for build regressions both for gcc
and sparse.
