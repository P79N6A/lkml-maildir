 This number alone doesn't really tell anything.
 There should be an extra line in the log / on the console,
 which contains two more 64bit numbers. Putting these into
 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/cruft/parsemce.c
 will decode

 (I really should make that tool a little friendlier ..
  I'll do it soon)
