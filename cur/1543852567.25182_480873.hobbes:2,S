I like the general approach.  A few tidbits...
- the comment for __new_inode isn't accurate, there is no @autonum
parameter added.
- I'm not sure what the point of wrapping __new_inode() in new_inode()
is.  Why not just remove the i_ino setting from new_inode, (or
initialize it to 0*), and let new_inode_autonum() call new_inode();
iunique() ?  Less indirection IMHO....
- *does setting the new i_ino to 0 really help catch anything?  And if
it does, perhaps just setting it in alloc_inode() with all the other
field initializations would be more consistent.
- the comment for the s_nextino field is a bit misleading, it is
actually not used in new_inode(), only in iunique().
