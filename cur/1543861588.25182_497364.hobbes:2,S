It will help a little; e2fsck -D compresses the logical view of the
directory, but it doesn't optimize the physical layout on disk at all,
and of course, it won't help with the lack of readahead logic.  It's
possible to improve how e2fsck -D works, at the moment, it's not
trying to make the directory be contiguous on disk.  What it should
probably do is to pull a list of all of the blocks used by the
directory, sort them, and then try to see if it can improve on the
list by allocating some new blocks that would make the directory more
contiguous on disk.  I suspect any improvements that would be seen by
doing this would be second order effects at most, though.
