Okay, what about:
* switch system state to suspend_state_t (initialy u32)
* pass system state down to the drivers
* create helpers to convert from system state to PCI state (etc)
* create some well-known suspend_state_t's
	(like suspend_state_t prepare_for_powerdown = 3). Drivers may
	either compare state passed to them with one of well-known
	states, or call a helper
This should solve current mess. If we'll want to do runtime power
managment (etc), we can change suspend_state_t into structure /
whatever, but we will not break all the drivers this time. (=> this
approach does not solve runtime suspend, but will probably make it
easier).
I'd like to do this in 2.6.9 timeframe...
