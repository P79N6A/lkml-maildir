You will find the same information on my site. Therefore, I do NOT
decline this vulnerability. I decline it's security implications. It's
on the same level as the vulnerability, that you will give away your
root password under torture.[2]
Nothing about kernel crypto is backdoored. If Ruusu thinks different, he
should show me source code. Till then, treat it as FUD.

[2] I think the torture vulnerability is more serious than any
watermarking "attack". "Rubberhosing" can be fixed btw.

Unfortunately, original site is down and source code outdated.
