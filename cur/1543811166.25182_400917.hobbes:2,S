What's complicated about the scheduler?  I see simple/elegant when I
look in there.  Interaction with the user is complex, but interactive
feel is a nebulous thing not restricted to this scheduler.
I really don't think this patch adds complexity, quite the opposite
actually.  It just does a small bit of tweaking to the scheduler's weak
spot, and adds a dirt simple barrier against starvation.  IMO, this
scheduler is not only quite simple, it's one weakness is generally
wonderful for throughput.  It's just that it's sometimes a bit _too_
wonderful ;-)
