Hello,
I noticed this behaviour, too. Can't remember if it came with
2.6.11-rc3-mm2 or with 2.6.11-rc4-mm1. Didn't try another kernel.
I was able to workaround this problem by doing
"echo platform > /sys/power/disk"
before
"echo disk > /sys/power/state"
The box is a desktop with an asus A7V133 mb (VIA 82Cxxx chipset), Athlon
XP 1600+ CPU and NVidia Geforce2 MX400 graphics.
