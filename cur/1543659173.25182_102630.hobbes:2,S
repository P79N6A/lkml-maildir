That's fine for this particular troll, but some of the more well-known
trolls here are so good at what they do that you sometimes have to read
their messages while sober -- the errors can be subtle and well-hidden. So
much so, sometimes, that I suspect it's done on purpose.
Besides, filtering in the MUA is blatantly the wrong place to do it. The 
MTA (or MDA) should be doing the filtering.¹
