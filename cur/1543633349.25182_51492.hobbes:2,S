The error code returned is "check condition" with a sense key of 3
"medium error". The most appropriate driver action would have been to
issue a "request sense" command to learn the precise error and retry
only in case of a good chance of a recoverable problem - but that's a
different story.

The intersting bits of the DMA status register are bits 0 though 2. A
value of 5 indicates the condition "interrupt from unit, DMA state
machine active". This is a valid status! It basically means the unit
issued an interrupt before the PRD table is exhausted. This makes sense
because the CD-ROM units fails to transfer the amount of data described
by the PRD table because of the non-recoverable read error.

What you makes sense (the next DMA transfer is scheduled but never
carried out by the CD-ROM unit) except for the panic, ofcoz. The
correct driver action in this case were stopping the DMA engine and
issuing a reset of the state machines involved (both on the host and
the unit side).

I hope this clears up things a little ...
