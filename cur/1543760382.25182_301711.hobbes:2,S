It's still the same on Solaris 10. /usr/bin/ln behaves like Linux, and
/usr/xpg4/bin/ln behaves like POSIX.

I second that.

The Solaris implementation of the POSIX behavior is done mostly
in userspace, as running truss with /usr/xpg4/bin/ln shows. The
actual link system call seems to be always the same one, with a
Linux-like behavior. /usr/xpg4/bin/ln only invokes resolvepath()
(a realpath()-like system call) first.

In the standards sense of portability, they can; the formally conforming
Solaris environment behaves as POSIX specifies, and Linux has never been
formally conforming to POSIX.1-2001 anyway.

I personally agree, but I doubt our opinion matters much.
