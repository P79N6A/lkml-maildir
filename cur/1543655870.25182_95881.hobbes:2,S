Yep, sorry.
kbuild check if any obj-* value has been assigned a value,
so an empty assignment does not help.
I have made a patch that works this time.
Kai, any ideas how to do this in a better way?
- I have considered a derived symbol in sound/isa/Kconfig,
something like:
bool SND_EMUX_SYNTH
depends on SND && SND_SEQUENCER && SND_SBAWE
and then in the Makefile:
obj-$(CONFIG_SND_EMUX_SYNTH) := snd-emux-synth.o
That would make the Makefile trivial, but sound/ did not use any derived
symbols in the Kconfig file, so I did not test this approach.
I'm prepared to clean up all sound/ makefiles if this approach is
considered better than what is used today.
