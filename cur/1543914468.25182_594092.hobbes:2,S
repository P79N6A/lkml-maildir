yeah, i had something a bit like originally but didn't like the name
so changed it and poked the top-level Makefile

so would i, i assume it was davej + others so i cc'd him on this

ok, i'll try that

no, it's so we catch things like
linux/build/Makefile
 *and*
linux/build/foo/bar/Makefile

right, actually, it can be uncommented but the 'make help' fails; i'm
not sure if we need make help to work since most of the other targets
won't anyhow
so should i remove it (leaving 'make help' as usable) or remove it?

ok

ok (though i'm not a big fan of ls | grep as a rule, it tends to be
fragile when people do dumb things)

i tried to preserve as much logic as possible from the original
script, at least initially
i'll change that

what about something like?
    sed -n "s/^ALTARCH[[:space:]]:=[[:space:]]\(.*$\)\+/\1/p"
(i'm sure there is a better way though)

it all seems to work
