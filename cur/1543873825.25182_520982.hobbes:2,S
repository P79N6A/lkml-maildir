The processor is not changing frequency in response to your
launch of mplayer.  The powersave governor forces it to the
lowest frequency regardless of system load.  You really want
to use ondemand for dynamic frequency scaling.
Can you use a serial or network console to capture any messages
the kernel is sending when mplayer starts?
