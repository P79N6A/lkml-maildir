You should submit these changes all as you fix them to the relevant
maintainers and mailing lists. There is only limited review capacity
and sending too many may tax it too much. So it's best used spaced
out -- as you do them. Also then you probably still remember why
you actually changed something. The few kgdb that were submitted
ever usually had the problem that they were submitted by someone
else who didn't do the work and couldn't quite remember why they
were actually needed.  Unsurprisingly they often didn't get
merged then.

The main interface are the (somewhat misnamed) die chains. More and more 
architectures are moving to them. 
There probably needs to be another one for serial intercept, but that 
should be very simple.  For network netpoll already exists.

At some point we had a fully modular kdb (modprobe kdb worked) 
and kgdb was nearly there. Unfortunately the changes for kdb were
somewhat ugly. Unfortunately that work never hit the standard
patchkits for kgdb/kdb.

kprobes already do that fine with the existing interfaces. Also
single stepping is not particularly complicated so i don't see why
you want to abstract it.
The other issue that needed some changes was stopping all CPUs for
debugging. Since some other subsystems (like kexec) have this problem
already i would suggest generalizing and exporting what they have already.
