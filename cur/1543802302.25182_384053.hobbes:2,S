In theory it could be an uninitialized phys_proc_id (0xff >> 1), 
but it could be also the BIOS just setting the local APIC of CPU 1
to 0xff for some reason.
If you add a printk("PHYSCPU %d %x\n", smp_processor_id(), phys_proc_id[smp_processor_id()])
at the end of arch/x86_64/kernel/setup.c:early_identify_cpu() what does
dmesg | grep PHYSCPU output?

It's called pni (prescott new instructions) for historical reasons. We added
the bit too early before Intel's marketing department could make up its
mind fully, so Linux is stuck with the old codename.
