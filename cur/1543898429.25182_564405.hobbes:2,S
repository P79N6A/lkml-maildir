I don't believe anyone has implemented this before, so any experts would
be self-appointed.
Maybe this should be turned into a filesystem subject after all.  The
complexity comes from combining XIP with writes on the same chip.  So
solving your problem should be identical to solving the rw XIP
filesystem problem.
If there is interest in the latter, I'd offer my self-appointed
expertise.
