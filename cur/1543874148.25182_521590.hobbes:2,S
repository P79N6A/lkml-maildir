Yes. I fixed that - simply checking that neighbour->dev is a
loopback device is sufficient to detect the fact that
the device is being unregistered.

I agree it's not possible.

infiniband sets parm->neigh_destructor, and I search for a way to prevent
this destructor from being called after the module has been unloaded.
Ideas?
