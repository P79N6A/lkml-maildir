As Dave Hansen mentioned elsewhere in this thread, there is no need to
define this is_node_online() macro, as node_online() does EXACTLY the same
thing (minus the BUG() which is probably overkill).

Christoph should replace all the for (i = 0; i < MAX_NUMNODES; i++) loops
with for_each_node(i) and the one loop that does this:
for (i = 0; i < MAX_NUMNODES; i++) {
	if (!node_online(i))
		continue;
(or something similar) with for_each_online_node(i)
Also, there is a similar loop for CPUs which should be replaced with
for_each_online_cpu(i).
These for_each_FOO macros are cleaner and less likely to break in the
future, since we can simply modify the one definition if the way to
itterate over nodes/cpus changes, rather than auditing 100 open coded
implementations and trying to determine the intent of the loop's author.
