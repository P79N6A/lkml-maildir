Dave, 
Currently in resuming path graphics device's pci space restore is 
behind host bridge, so resume function wrongly accesses graphics 
device's space. This makes resuming failure which crashed X. So 
here's a patch to restore device's pci space early, which makes
resuming ok with X. Patch against 2.6.20-rc5.
