Hi!
The acard problem is partly solved. I've mailed with Kenneth Ljungh
<kenneth.ljungh@starport.se> that now gets his acard to work with the
new patch from Mr Alan Cox. But for my card, it doesn't work.
Kenneth Ljungh has an Acard AEC-6712S and I've an Acard AEC-6710S.
While loading it as module or during boottime it gives about the same
error
since 2.2.0preX. ("about the same"= I  havn't compared the numbers, but
otherwise it is the same messages.)
I asked Kenneth to mail me his atp870u files, so I could be sure that
I didn't make something stupid.
As module it says:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
kassandra:/lib/modules/2.2.13/scsi# insmod atp870u.o
aec671x_detect:
   ACARD AEC-671X PCI Ultra/W SCSI-3 Host Adapter: 0    IO:fe80, IRQ:10.

And there it stops.
I
hope this can help. I'm ofcourse willing to test whatever is needed.
Thank you, Mr Alan Cox very much for working on the Acard problem!
