It needs to be recognised by the lvm userspace utilities before it can
be used.
One other thing this might be very useful for is `swsusp from encrypted
swap'. With dm-crypt, it should be very easy to create a crypto mapping
from initrd from which swsusp can resume. IMHO this is a killer feature
for notebook users (everything encrypted but the boot partition).
