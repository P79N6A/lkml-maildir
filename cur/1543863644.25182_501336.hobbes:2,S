Thanks. The first of these is not at all what we are seeing. However I guess
there could be a remote chance it's triggering our THRE errata as it did for
the pnx4008 boards.

This second patch failure description is identical to what we are seeing without
the THRE work-around. This must be the timer patch Alan mentioned but it's not
in the linux.git at l-m.o.
Could you please explain what you mean by and where I can find the "-mm tree"?
