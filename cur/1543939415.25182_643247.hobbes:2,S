Actually, another thought: permitting (and handling) spurious faults for
kernel mappings conflicts with NMI handling, i.e. great care would be
needed to ensure the NMI path cannot touch any such mapping. So
even the present Xen/Linux Dom0 implementation may have some
(perhaps unlikely) problems here, and it would get worse if we added
e.g. a virtual watchdog NMI (something I am considering, which would
then extend the problem to DomU-s).
