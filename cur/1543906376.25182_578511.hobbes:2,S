That's why the g_new() form that glib uses makes some sense.  It
borrows an idiom from C++, and although we all know C++ is a horrid
language, to some extent lots of people are familiar with it.

Well, this is not some earth-shattering stuff, but I think it would be
good to have.  I got used to it in glib, and I miss it in linux.
I understand the knee-jerk reaction of most people who are unfamiliar
with it, and I can do nothing about that.  If there's no positive
feedback I'll just give up, it's not that I can't live with the
current situation.
