Please forgive posting to this thread, but I had this issue a few weeks back.
I was messing about with my bespoke Quake2 Xatrix server code, and have added 
a lot of standard string functions  for speed and stuff.  I used a few from 
the linux kernel string functions.
Read the thread for what went on:

I don't expect a reason here, just I couldn't get it to work at all - but the 
assembler one did...
