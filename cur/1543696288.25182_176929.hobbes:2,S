AFAIK, sockaddr_storage{} was introduced because sockaddr_in6{} 
is too large for sockaddr{}.  However, the use of sockaddr_storage{} 
is not limited to IPv6. Systems which does not support IPv6 may have 
sockaddr_storage{}.
BTW, there're little chances for users to use sockaddr_in{} or sockaddr_in6{}.
Modern and "good" applications never use them.
Use getaddrinfo(3) / getnameinfo(3) (which uses addrinfo{} and sockaddr{}).
If you need a structure to hold socket address, 
you may use sockaddr_storage{}; i.e. for getsockname(2) / getpeername(2).
If you are UNABLE to avoid touching socket address structure, use it finally;
This is very rare.
Well, this is kernel developmen list. Please change the list.
Thanks.
