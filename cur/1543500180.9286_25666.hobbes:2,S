Linux supports automatical loading of kernel modules whenever application
attempts to use the corresponding resources. More specifically, placing in
/etc/modules.conf the line:
alias net-pf-17 af_packet
and rerunning "depmod -a" will ensure that af_packet.o is loaded when
tcpdump(8) attempts to open a socket of the corresponding family.
