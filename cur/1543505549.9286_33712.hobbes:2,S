Hi,
I have a MAD16 based soundcard (Philips SB70) and I'm running
into troubles when compiling the driver as a module.
When I compile the driver into the kernel sounds works without a glitch.
When I compile the driver as a module all sound sources continue to work
with no problems (cd,audio,mike,etc) but now I have a constant clicking
goint back and forth between left and right speaker...
This only goes away after reseting the computer, unloading the modules
doesn't help.
I have seen this since 2.0.3? (whener sound got modular) but never got
to report
it (instead I just continued to compile the driver into the kernel).
Does someone know what is going on?
