Depends how much of gnome you use.  I used to swear by -Os for
non-toolchain stuff, but in the end I got bitten by gnumeric on x86.
http://bugs.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128834
 is similar, but in my case
opening *any* spreadsheet would cause gnumeric to segfault (gcc-3.3
series).  Add in the time spent rebuilding gnome before I found this bug
report, and adding extra parts of gnome just in case I missed something,
and the time to load it is irrelevant.  Since then I've had an anecdotal
report that -Os is known to cause problems with gnome.  I s'pose people
will say it serves me right for doing my initial testing on ppc which
didn't have this problem ;)  The point is that -Os is *much* less tested
than -O2 at the moment.
