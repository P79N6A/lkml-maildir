You are right, PS3 controller is going to be shipped in both variants. On 
the other hand it is perfectly possible that we will need special 
force-feedback driver for it anyway.
BTW when talking about this - we already have PS3 quirk present in usb hid 
(extra control URB is required to make it operational), probably something 
similar will be needed for BT version too.

Sure. I will take this through my tree then, thanks.
