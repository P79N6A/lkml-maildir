Hi Henning, Axel.
Axel: Patch for your attention enclosed...

Ah...thanks for that...
Enclosed is a patch to add relevant text to the Configure.help file to
provide for that option. It also splits up a rather long paragraph in
the umsdos help that followed it into several smaller paragraphs.
Hopefully, this will find its way into the 2.3.3 kernel...
Best wishes from Riley.
