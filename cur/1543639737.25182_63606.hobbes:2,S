I have discussed it with David - he said it's OK in 2.5, but
not in 2.4, and he has eyeballed the diff.
However there's another thing to think about:
	local_irq_disable();
	atomic_inc();
If the architecture implements atomic_inc with spinlocks, this will
schedule with interrupts off with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y, I expect.
I can fix that with a preempt_disable() in there, but ick.
