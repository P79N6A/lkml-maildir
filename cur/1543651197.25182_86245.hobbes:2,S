Cliff, has there been a russian timezone working day since you requested 
it?  (I don't have access to your original email at the moment.) If 
there has been, then Nikita, please explain why the request was lost, 
and assure me that next time it goes into someone's todo list, and gets 
responded to on the same day.
Hans
