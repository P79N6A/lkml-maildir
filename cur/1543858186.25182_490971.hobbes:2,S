I took over IDE when hotplug was already broken (late 2.5), moreover IDE
hotplug support has been always a quick hack according to its original author...
I remember your great efforts to fix it but unfortunately they
depended on executing
ioctls on non-existing devices which made them depend on layering
violation in 2.6,
also IDE device model fixes has some conflicts with them.  I take the
blame for not
applying them (for the reasons given above) and for taking much too
long in reviewing/testing them (due to lack of time not bad intention)
but accusing me of
intentional feature removal is going a bit too far...  You can hate me
all you want
for the way I did my entirely volunteer and unpaid job (but hey there
were and still is shortage of ATA hackers and there weren't anybody to
step up and takeover IDE)
but I actually have always taken responsibility/blame for all my
patches and patches
I accepted so if you really think I intentionally removed some usable
hotplug support
please point me to specific patch and describe the regression after
applying this
specific patch and I will do my best to have this regression fixed...
