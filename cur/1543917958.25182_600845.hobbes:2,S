Maybe, maybe not. Even if so, it would be very difficult to find. Simply
grepping for sched_yield is not going to help because determining whether a
given use of sched_yield is smart is not going to be easy.

User-space spinlocks are broken so spinlocks can only be implemented in
kernel-space? Even if you use the kernel to schedule/unschedule the tasks,
you still have to spin in user-space.

You are assuming that random latencies are necessarily bad. Random latencies
may be significantly better than predictable high latency.

Thank you. Unfortunately, neither of these does what sched_yiled is really
supposed to do. Opportunistic mode does too little and agressive mode does
too much.

I don't have a problem with failing to emulate the old scheduler's behavior
if we can show that the new behavior has saner semantics. Unfortunately, in
this case, I think CFS' semantics are pretty bad. Neither of these is what
sched_yield is supposed to do.
Note that I'm not saying this is a particularly big deal. And I'm not
calling CFS' behavior a regression, since it's not really better or worse
than the old behavior, simply different.
I'm not familiar enough with CFS' internals to help much on the
implementation, but there may be some simple compromise yield that might
work well enough. How about simply acting as if the task used up its
timeslice and scheduling the next one? (Possibly with a slight reduction in
penalty or reward for not really using all the time, if possible?)
