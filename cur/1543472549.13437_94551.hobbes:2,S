Hello,
2.1.132-pre3 is much better than 2.1.131-ac12. It does not lock up
anymore. But the network hangs pretty fast. This can be found in syslog:
planetzork kernel: eth0: Tx timed out, lost interrupt? TSR=0x3,ISR=0x3, t=951.
planetzork kernel: eth0: Tx timed out, lost interrupt? TSR=0x3,ISR=0x3, t=1000.
planetzork last message repeated 2 times
planetzork kernel: Socket destroy delayed (r=0 w=5248)
There still seems to be a little bug inside the 8390 code. This should
be fixed before 2.2 because I don't think that I am the only one who
uses smp and a ne2k network card. If you need further informations just
let me know.
Regards,
   Jogi
