So I have a .config with CONFIG_ADVANCED_PARTION not set, and 
CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION=y.  (I.E. the default from arch/i386/defconfig.)
I fire up make menuconfig and expand the advanced partition menu (setting 
CONFIG_ADVANCED_PARTITION to y).  MSDOS partition support is NOT set in the 
newly opened menu, I.E. opening the menu has the side effect of deselecting 
CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION.
If I do nothing else, and save with the menu open, it's off.  (Saved as "not 
set".)  If I fire it up again and close the menu, CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION 
becomes Y again.
What magic am I failing to understand here?  (This sort of seems intentional, 
but it would make more sense for MSDOS partition support to default to on 
when you first open the menu...)
