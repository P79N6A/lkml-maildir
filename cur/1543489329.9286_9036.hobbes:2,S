I have an old NEC Image P90 machine. It currently is running a stock
RedHat 5.2 distribution (plus the latest X11 and some security upgrades)
on kernel 2.0.36 (final).
I've downloaded 2.2.0 through 2.2.2-ac7 and have been unable to boot the
machine into any kind of 2.2.x kernel.
I get LILO saying
Loading linux Kernel...
Uncompressing Kernell.... ok, now booting kernel
and then the machine just hangs. 2.0.36 works fine so I don't think it's
a hardware problem. Is there any way to get any more information about
what's going on?
Here are some more basic specs on the machine if anyone has any ideas.
Pentium 90
CMD640 chipset w/2 IDE drives and 1 IDE CD-ROM drive.
ET4000 W32p PCI video (on-board)
NE2000 ISA Ethernet card
3com 905b PCI ethernet card.
ES1688 ISA Sound card.
Thanks,
Tarun
