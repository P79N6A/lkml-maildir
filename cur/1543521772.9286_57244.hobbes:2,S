hello.
i have a system that was running very nicely up untill i installed this new
(to the machine) 5 gig drive
it was running 2.2.14 with a 500mg mounted as /
i wanted toconvert the system to the 5Gb and mounted it as /mnt after
partioning it to full size and formating it.
the 500 meg is /dev/hda1
an 80meg is /dev/hdb1 (all swap)
it ran fine like this for a very long time.. very reliable
then i mounted /dev/hdc1 (the 5 gig... set to SINGLE on the secondary ide)
and occationaly when i was trying to xfer the system using cp-a etc it would
just suddly FREEZE everything.. no kernel panic messages or ANY messages for
that matter.
so i finanly took out the 500M and installed the 5 gig as /dev/hda1 (master
on primary ide)
and installed an entire SuSE 6.1 fresh install.
the i compiled 2.2.14  and 3.3.5 xfree86
no problems..
then when i was trying to tar -xzf xfree86.3.3.5-1  it froze like it did
before
then i tried doing a make with BitchX and it did it again..
no just for background.. this drive only 30 mins before allthis originally
was happening was working flawless ly on another linux system where it was
partioned with win98 and the motherboard/bios was a very new (late 99) Award
ABIT setup .
so i can only assume its the motherboard or something that is causing this?
please if you could just give me a few ideas as to what might be causing
this or if you could think of a way for me to possibly troubleshoot (ie:
rule out certain factors) then i would really appreciate it.
the problem system is a Matsonic MS-5120 motherboard with some 4-98 Award
bios .
i do not belive the drive is ATA66.
any info would really be appriciated.. thanks alot
