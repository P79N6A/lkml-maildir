Note that my patch #if 0's exactly one functions and removes no 
functions. Most it does is the removal of EXPORT_SYMBOL's, so if any 
modular code will use any of them, re-adding will be trivial.
Modular ISAPnP might be interesting in some cases, but this is more 
legacy code. If someone would work on it to sort all the issues out 
(starting with the point that most users of __ISAPNP__ will have to be 
fixed) re-adding the required EXPORT_SYMBOL's won't be hard for him.
