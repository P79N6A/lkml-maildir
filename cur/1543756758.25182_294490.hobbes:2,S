Yes, that was also my opinion, but after using AGPGART, hmm.
And it was on my last 32 bit FC2 systems with other hardware the same slow 
operations on the desktop. And I'm not alone, there are some nvnews.net 
linux forum users which report the same slow performance with AGPGART.
Maybe the linux kernel AGPGART do not run well with the nVidia 2D 
acceleration renderer or the kernel driver and is a nvidia problem.
