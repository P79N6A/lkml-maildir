It would probaly be on if the drive motor is on.
The system could just read somthing from the disk every now and then.
That would make either a turned on LED or a  flashing LED ( even cooler
:-)
Offcourse it should be taken into concern to read from the HW, not from
cache.
The floppy driver maintainer should knowhow this works ...
