OK, thanks.
If you have time, could you please test
2.6.21-rc5 +
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.21-rc5/2.6.21-rc5-mm2/broken-out/origin.patch
 +
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.21-rc5/2.6.21-rc5-mm2/broken-out/git-acpi.patch
which will allow us to eliminate any non-acpi patches.
And please keep an eye on these bugs for us, don't let us merge these
problems into 2.6.22.  It is bad of us to allow known failures to propagate
into mainline and it has happened a couple of times in recent months.
