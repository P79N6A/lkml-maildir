I don't think that the Wine problem resolution is due to the POPF 
instruction handling. Basically Linus patch does a nice cleanup plus POPF 
handling, so maybe the patch can be split.

Yes, this was true with 2.4. Than it has been fixed some time ago. But 
handling that revealed a fragile handling of ptrace event delivery we had 
in do_syscall_trace(). Part of the Linus patch tries to solve the fact 
that on one side strace wants things to happen in a certain way, way that 
seem to break Wine. I think Linus cleanup of the ptrace event delivery can 
get strace, Wine and single-step-after-syscall right, w/out POPF handling. 
Then you guys can flame each other over the POPF handling ;)
