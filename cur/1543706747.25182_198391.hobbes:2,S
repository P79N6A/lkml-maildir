Hi
I am having here a device  (Tablet PC ) sample with a serial resistive 
touchscreen  .
Under Windows it comes up as COM1 at IO-Base 0x220 -0x227 IRQ 4 .
Now it seems that in linux the serial driver doesnt look for so "low" 
I/O-Base `s .
By hacking around by hardcoding the 0x220 somehwere in serial.c i get it 
to detect a standard 16550 , but
unfortunately it then assumes that all ttySX have this base .
This is because of my hardcoded hack and the driver not looking for all 
the rest mem bases.
So the quesion is :
Where do i tell serial.o  to start lower ( at 0x220 ) to look for 
controllers .. .??
Pls also CC me directly since i am only monitoring this list .
