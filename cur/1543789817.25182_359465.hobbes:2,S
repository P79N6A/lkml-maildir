I haven't taken a close look at that code, but don't those just give
you physical ranges that can 'possibly' be removed?  So, isn't it
possible for hotpluggable ranges to contain pages allocated for kernel
data structures which would be almost impossible to offline?

By examining the fragmentation usemaps, we have a pretty good idea about
how the blocks are being used.  If a block is flagged as 'User Pages' then
there is a good chance that it can be offlined.  Of course, depending on
exactly how those 'user pages' are being used will determine if they can
be offlined.  If the offline of a section marked user is unsuccessful, you
can retry in the hope that the situation was transient.  Or, you can move
on to the next user block.  By concentrating your efforts on blocks only
containing user pages, your chances of success are greatly increased.
For blocks that are marked 'Kernel' we know an offline will not be successful
and don't even try.
