Well, swsusp is *way* better reviewed than suspend2, because it is
<10% of code size, and it is in kernel already (plus Rafael did the
reviews/rewriting).
Your point about uswsusp is "interesting", but notice that noone ever
reviewed suspend2, either. So... if you care about your data, swsusp
is currently the _safest_ way to go. (It may not have the _nicest_
progress indication :-).
