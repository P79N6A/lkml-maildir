No, this is not a relative offset (it would be appropriate if the
program tries to relocate itself), but a genuine address in a program
which always runs from address 0 (relative to some segment, but it
doesn't matter).

Agreed, but in this case it's perfectly clear that the code will run
from address 0, so it should be written as such.
For such purposes, it would be wonderful if somebody could teach gas
how to assemble absolute code and make real location of code and base
for calculation of symbols independent. It probably could be done with
sections and a cleverly written ldscript (modulo ld bugs), but it's
nowhere near elegant.
				Have a nice fortnight
