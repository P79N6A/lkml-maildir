Personally, I think hot-plugging a 33mhz pci device into a 66mhz pci bus 
with other active devices on it is either user error or designer error 
(should have had a bridge), and a 'virtual disconnect and reconnect' is 
reasonable. 
You're going to kill (or at least stop) any transactions going on on the
bus while you're physically hot-plugging anway..
