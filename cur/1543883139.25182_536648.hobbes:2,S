You're really just making both of those up.
If a kernel thread holds a lock and deadlocks suspend, that would deadlock 
anythign else _too_. Suspend isn't *that* special. Everything it does are 
things other people do too.
And no, kernel threads do not write to disk on their own. Name one. They 
help *others* write to disk, but those disk writes need to happen.
The freezer has *caused* those deadlocks (eg by stopping threads that were 
needed for the suspend writeouts to succeed!), not solved them.
So stop making these totally bogus arguments up.
