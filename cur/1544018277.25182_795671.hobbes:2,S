Right, but I think load-balancing should be explicitly enabled,
i.e., we probably don't want to do it by default for AES-NI.
The way I see load balancing work is if you had a template that
sat on top of cryptd pass the requests to the cryptd on a CPU
it chooses.
Then we can enable it for any algorithm in the system simply
by instantiating that template for it.
