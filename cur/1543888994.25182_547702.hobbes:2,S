If we know how yes. Probably the X server needs to provide us with a
simple list of operations to perform or failing that write 128K of null
to the display then print the characters (the 128K should ensure any
running FIFO for commands is stuffed and we get back to the framebuffer)

We don't want to touch the video bios for most cards, its not as good as
the X mode switcher code, nor for that matter does it work in a lot of
cases as they use IRQ and DMA functions sometimes.
