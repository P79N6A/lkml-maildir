Subject: 2.4.0 boot failure on Micronic W6Li

2.4.0 doesn't seem to want to boot on my W6Li with two PPRO 150's.  
THis machine has no problems with 2.2 kernels, and is currently running
2.2.17.
It uncompresses, and prints that it is booting, then locks hard.  Must
reset.
I have tried the noapic option, with no effect.
I have searched for information on this problem, but I can't seem to find
anything.  I guess no one else is having this problem ona W6Li.
Please help.
