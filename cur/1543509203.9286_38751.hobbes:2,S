	Depends in your init setup, the /proc echos are global though.
The per user limits will be picked up by any child procs, so you
could set it in the script that calls all of your other start scripts.
I normally do the system wide stuff during while the system is going
through single user on its way to multi, and add the per user change
to the startup script for any particular program that needs it.
