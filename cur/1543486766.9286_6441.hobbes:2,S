Hi there all
Sorry to bother you with what could prolly be a trivial or stupid question.
I have just upgraded to kernel 2.2.1 with a patch ( not sure which one
unfortunately. anyway . the server seems to crash with no logs to
/var/log/message on random occations ( 3 times so far in 5 hours ) 
when I restart I noticed this in the kernel messages booting up 
Feb 21 19:16:25 tudogs syslogd 1.3-3: restart.
Feb 21 19:16:25 tudogs kernel: klogd 1.3-3, log source = /proc/kmsg started.
Feb 21 19:16:26 tudogs kernel: Loaded 7059 symbols from
/usr/src/linux/System.map.
Feb 21 19:16:26 tudogs kernel: Symbols match kernel version 2.2.1.
Feb 21 19:16:26 tudogs kernel: Error seeking in /dev/kmem
Feb 21 19:16:26 tudogs kernel: Error adding kernel module table entry.   
Could this have anything to do with it ?
Thanks in advance 
Henti smith
