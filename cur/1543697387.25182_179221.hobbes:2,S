You left out the black helicopters... the reason vendors support Linux is
to sell product. If the driver doesn't work well some number of people
will either debug and fix the problem (source) or not buy the product
(binary). And giving out the spec and letting someone else do the driver
is even better, no work, no cost, no liability for bugs.
I think the vendors who feel that they have something to hide are the
exception, and rumor has it that fixes in Linux drivers migrate back into
Windows drivers, another fringe benefit.

On that I agree, but remember that only one Penguin has a vote on that. A
Trademark must be defended or it will be lost, maybe this would be a good
place to start. Let a lawyer advise on stuff like that.
