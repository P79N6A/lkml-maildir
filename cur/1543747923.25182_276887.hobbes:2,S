We need to add pm_message_t to resume, I agree about that, but yes, it
would be quite bad if I added this, too.
All changes I'm doing are "break nothing", because pm_message_t is
typedefed to u32 for now. Therefore they can be safely merged in any
order etc...
For the documentation changes... I already rewrote that twice. I'm not
native english speaker and I need some sleep now. If you send me
nicely-looking diff, I'm likely to accept it :-).
