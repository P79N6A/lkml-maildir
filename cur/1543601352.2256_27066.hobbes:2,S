No, that's not the bug.
The mmap semaphore is a read-write semaphore, and it _is_ permissible to
call "copy_to_user()" and friends while holding the read lock.
The bug appears to be in the implementation of the write semaphore -
down_write() doesn't undestand that blocked writes must not block new
readers, exactly because of this situation. 
The situation wrt read-write spinlocks is exactly the same, btw, except
there we have "readers can have interrupts enabled even if interrupts
also take read locks" instead of having user-level faults.
Why do we want to explicitly allow this behaviour wrt mmap_sem? Because
some things are inherently racy without it (ie threaded processes that
read or write the address space - coredumping, ptrace etc).
