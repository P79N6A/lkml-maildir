Hello all,
In addition to the 14 new CONFIG symbols without help texts which
2.4.6-pre6 introduced, 2.4.5-ac20 has 5 more, for a total of 19 in -ac20.
Here are the five new symbols in 2.4.5-ac20 which don't have
Configure.help texts and likely should have. If you're the owner
of these, please provide the appropriate help texts for Configure.help.
Or, if they don't need no steenking help texts, please let ESR and me
know that too.
Thanks in advance,
Steven
