Ok, that should be reasonably "portable" (ie it won't break horribly and
silently in the future when something changes in inode-land). Just doing a
few ops (knowing you're under the inode lock) and then calling
"generic_drop_inode()" should be fine.
[ Except right now only the "generic_delete_inode()" thing is exported, so
  you'd need to export the other generic stuff, but that was kind of my
  plan anyway, I just don't wan tto do it until there is some real need. ]
