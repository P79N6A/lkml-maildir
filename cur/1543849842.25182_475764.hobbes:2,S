Subject: [PATCH 001 of 4] md: Fix bug where spares don't always get rebuilt properly when they become live.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

If save_raid_disk is >= 0, then the device could be a device that is 
already in sync that is being re-added.  So we need to default this
value to -1.
