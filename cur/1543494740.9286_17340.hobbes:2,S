	Stack trace will not help here - grow_inodes() was called due to
shortage of free inodes and it stumbled accross the thing with i_count
being 0 and i_sb being FUBAR. We never deallocate struct super, so it's
not a case of a dangling pointer after kfree(). We never deallocate struct
inode and reuse it only for other inodes, so either it's a corrupted cache
chain (not modified outside of inode.c) or corrupted i_sb or random memory
corruption from completely unrelated source...
