First we need to discover them and I doubt that mm covers much more than 
development loads. I hope we can get to a point where we have SLUB be 
the primarily allocator soon but I would expect various performance issues 
to show up.
On the other hand: I am pretty sure that SLUB can replace SLOB completely 
given SLOBs limitations and SLUBs more efficient use of space. SLOB needs 
8 bytes of overhead. SLUB needs none. We may just have to #ifdef out the 
debugging support to make the code be of similar size to SLOB too. SLOB is 
a general problem because its features are not compatible to SLAB. F.e. it 
does not support DESTROY_BY_RCU and does not do reclaim the right way etc 
etc. SLUB may turn out to be the ideal embedded slab allocator.
