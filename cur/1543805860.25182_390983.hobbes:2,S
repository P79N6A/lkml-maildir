Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Fix overflow issues with sysctl values in centiseconds/seconds
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew,
Here's a threesome of patches to fix up some issues with the following 
sysctl values:
/proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs
The issues:
1. The values are not range checked when they are set. They all have
a range smaller than the full integer range.
2. Conversion from these centisecond/second values is done on-the-fly 
wherever they are used. This wastes some resources.
3. The conversions are done badly. Conversion from USER_HZ to HZ is done 
by doing "value * USER_HZ / HZ". One day expressed in centiseconds 
already causes an overflow at HZ = 250. This should use 
clock_t_to_jiffies() instead.
The approach:
1. Represent everything in jiffies internally.
2. Do the conversion and range checking in the sysctl interface.
Cheers,
Bart
