hi, I have a audio card Intel HDA with chipset Realteck ALC880.
I have kernel 2.6.13.3 and I return this error when the pc start:
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1b.0[A] -> GSI 16 (level, low) -> IRQ 169
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:1b.0 to 64
hda_codec: Unknown model for ALC880, trying auto-probe from BIOS...
hda_codec: Cannot set up configuration from BIOS.  Using 3-stack mode...
This card is not supported?  I must patch the kernel?
Thanks everybody
Luca
