I didn't suggest enabling coherency.
You can cache your _incoherent_ memory as long as the CPU
has instructions that manipulate cache lines. This gives
you write-combining without AGP snooping overhead. If you
can have the CPU be incoherent too, you should do so.
I'm used to working with PowerPC, so maybe you'll tell me
that x86 is too lame to handle this. Hopefully AMD supports
most of these useful operations:
a. mark a cache line valid (with junk data)
b. cause immediate write-back
c. mark a cache line invalid (discard data)
d. prefetch for load
e. prefetch for store (leave clean)
f. create a zero-filled dirty cache line
g. write-back, then invalidate
h. mark some memory as "cached, but NOT coherent"
So you can work like this:
1. mark a cache line valid (with junk data)
2. modify the data the regular way
3. write-back, then invalidate
4. tell the video card to read the data
For data coming the other way:
1. ensure that the cache line isn't dirty
2. tell the video card to write data
3. ensure that the cache line isn't valid
4. prefetch for read
5. see what the video card had to say
