I'll try that.

Well, that only works with root permissions.

The kernel works pretty good with 2.6.14; I can now do 'make world' in
PTXdist and get a rootfs for the ARM and do 'make world NATIVE=1' and
'make run NATIVE=1' and the same thing builds for x86 and starts in a
console. klibc didn't compile for ARCH=um.

All that means that I need some libc and tools linking against it (or
static tools)...

That was the idea ;) But it seems that if I buy initramfs I'll have to
buy doing the mknod and rootfs mounting stuff from early userspace as
well...

I'll have a look :)
