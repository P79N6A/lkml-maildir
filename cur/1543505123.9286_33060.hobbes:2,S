Right, and this is why I would propose to send back ICMP from the
tunnel start point to the originating host for tunnel mode and prevent
the IPSEC stack from sending back ICMP in the case of a transport mode
encapsulation, letting the large mtu/small mss work its course.
Thanks, Alan, for these clarifications.
