Does it make sense to merge the first two patches of that patch series?
1. Provide common handling for marshalling data between userspace clients and
kernel mode Infiniband drivers.
2. Extend the Infiniband CM to include private data comparisons as part of its
connection request matching process.
This would make it easier to keep the openib tree in sync with the kernel.
