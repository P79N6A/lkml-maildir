It's good to know there is a precedent and that the backtrace issue has
been looked at on other architectures.

The experiments were carried out using the standard calling convention.
We may investigate less standard calling conventions, but they should
actually already be there given __write_lock_failed/__read_lock_failed.
i.e. if reliable backtraces are going to be an issue they should
already be an issue for rwlocks.
