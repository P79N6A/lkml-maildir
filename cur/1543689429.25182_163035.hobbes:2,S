I hope no ...
Some years ago, we converted the only part of the kernel that used as86
to GNU as: see arch/i386/boot. I think this was an improvement.
Using nasm for only one small piece of code would be a regression, imho.

PS: GCC pass .S assembler source files through cpp, so you get macros
expanding.
