This is wrong.
The generic VM layer does the kmap/kunmap itself these days (it really
always should have - it needs the page mapped itself for the memcpy
anyway, and depending on the low-level FS to do kmap/kunmap was an ugly
layering violation). 
So you should just remove all the kmap/kunmap stuff in
prepare/commit_write instead of adding more of them to handle the
brokenness.
