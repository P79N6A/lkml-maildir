Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: Make NR_IRQS configurable in Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Currrently on a SMP system we can theoretically support
NR_CPUS*224 irqs.  Unfortunately our data structures
don't cope will with that many irqs, nor does hardware
typically provide that many irq sources.
With the number of cores starting to follow Moores
law, and the apicid limits being raised beyond an 8bit
number trying to track our current maximum with our
current data structures would be fatal and wasteful.
So this patch decouples the number of irqs we support
from the number of cpus.  We can revisit this decision
once someone reworks the current data structures.
