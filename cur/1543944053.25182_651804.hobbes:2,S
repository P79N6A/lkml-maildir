Ok, that's git ID's
	b47711bfbcd4eb77ca61ef0162487b20e023ae55 2.6.24-git1
	9b73e76f3cf63379dcf45fcd4f112f5812418d0a 2.6.24-git2
so if you get a git tree, you can do
	gitk b47711b..9b73e76
to see what happened in there. 
However, the obvious candidates are the scheduler or the ocfs2 merge, and 
the latter is only relevant in case you use ocfs2, of course. 
The rest of it tends to be the DVB and SCSI updates.
But it would be great if you could do a bisect and verify. Just do
	git bisect start
	git bisect good b47711bfbcd4eb77ca61ef0162487b20e023ae55
	git bisect bad 9b73e76f3cf63379dcf45fcd4f112f5812418d0a
and off you go..
