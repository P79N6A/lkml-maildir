in the 5-patch stream i just sent there's no need to touch exit.c, and
the debugging check didnt hurt. But if you remove it from spinlock.h now
then i'll probably have to regenerate the 5 patches again :-| We can:
 - nuke it afterwards
 - or can leave it alone as-is (it did catch a couple of bugs in the past)
 - or can change the rwlock_is_locked() to !write_can_lock() and remove
   rwlock_is_locked() [!write_can_lock() is a perfect replacement for 
   it].
i'd prefer #3.
