Yes we have the barriers on the "wakeup", but this doesn't mean the
woken task must see the result of clear_bit() (unless it was really
unscheduled of course).

Even this can't help afaics.
Because the the whole clear_bit + wakeup sequence can happen after
the "if (!test_bit()) check and before finish_wait(). Please note
that from the waker's pov we are sleeping in TASK_KILLABLE state,
it will wake up us if we are at the front of the waitqueue.
(to clarify, I am talking about the imaginary sync_page_killable()
 above).
