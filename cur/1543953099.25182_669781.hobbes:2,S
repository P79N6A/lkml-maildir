My mention of a 2-CPU special case was just an off-hand idea.  I don't
really have any idea if that would be optimal given the tradeoff of
increaing signal_struct size.  The performance needs be analyzed.

I think I misled you about the use of the it_*_expires fields, sorry.
The task_struct.it_*_expires fields are used solely as a cache of the
head of cpu_timers[].  Despite the poor choice of the same name, the
signal_struct.it_*_expires fields serve a different purpose.  For an
analogous cache of the soonest timer to expire, you need to add new
fields.  The signal_struct.it_{prof,virt}_{expires,incr} fields hold
the setitimer settings for ITIMER_{PROF,VTALRM}.  You can't change
those in arm_timer.  For a quick cache you need a new field that is
the sooner of it_foo_expires or the head cpu_timers[foo] expiry time.
The shared_utime_sum et al names are somewhat oblique to anyone who
hasn't just been hacking on exactly this thing like you and I have.
Things like thread_group_*time make more sense.
There are now several places where you call both shared_utime_sum and
shared_stime_sum.  It looks simple because they're nicely encapsulated.
But now you have two loops through all CPUs, and three loops in
check_process_timers.
I think what we want instead is this:
	struct task_cputime
	{
		cputime_t utime;
		cputime_t stime;
		unsigned long long schedtime;
	};
Use one in task_struct to replace the utime, stime, and sum_sched_runtime
fields, and another to replace it_*_expires.  Use a single inline function
thread_group_cputime() that fills a sum struct task_cputime using a single
loop.  For the places only one or two of the sums is actually used, the
compiler should optimize away the extra summing from the loop.
Don't use __cacheline_aligned on this struct type itself, because most of
the uses don't need that.  When using alloc_percpu, you can rely on it to
take care of those needs--that's what it's for.  If you implement a
variant that uses a flat array, you can use a wrapper struct with
__cacheline_aligned for that.
Thanks,
Roland
