Urgh... I guess that you had less support calls along those lines.
OK, anyway: problem has _nothing_ with terminal settings or with the
shell. Couldn't have anything with the latter and posted code does the
right thing with the former (even if it wasn't originally set right, which
I doubt). However, different charsets have different locations for
pseudo-graphics. And believe me, lots of DOS programs were butt-ugly on
(e.g.) Cyrillic charsets. Could you spell "box boundary consisting of
letters"? Sweet memories of client config utilities from NW 2.x on
Pravetz... If you need CGA-compatible charset - use cp437. For more 
graceful solution - check dialog(1). BTW, I suspect that you could
seriously cut down on the coding simply calling dialog or whiptail - they
can handle such stuff quite fine.
And now for the first part of advice...
