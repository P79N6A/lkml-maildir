Best guess:  Depmod does some kind of funny type-based expansion and  
hashing of the symbols which doesn't understand the "__extension__"  
keyword.  Probably the simplest thing to do is to add "- 
D__extension__=" to the depmod preprocessing flags.  Alternatively  
you could teach depmod to completely ignore the __extension__ keyword  
when it shows up in the sources, but the former seems like it would  
be much simpler.
Just thinking about it we probably also need to educate sparse about  
__extension__ too.  Perhaps somebody could also add an sparse flag to  
make it warn about nonportable constructs in exported header files.
I'd submit a patch but my knowledge of kernel makefiles and depmod is  
somewhere between zero and none, exclusive.
Cheers,
