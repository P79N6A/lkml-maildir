Well, I am on Debian stable, and the only Xfree4 contributed packages
are for 4.0.
I will move on to 4.1 when Debian moves on, but as you know they are
slower than a tired snail when it comes to new releases.
I wonder how many other people use these 4.0 packages off:
deb 
ftp://debian.cri74.org/debian-cri
 potato/contrib_luis_sismeiro main
non-free
