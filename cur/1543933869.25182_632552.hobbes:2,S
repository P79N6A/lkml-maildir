I know that. 000b is for the demo application. 000c is for the
bootloader application.
I am not a progammer myself but I think the USB communication part
of both the two libusb based application are fine. I have no comments
about the other part of fsusb coce.

If it does not work, read my patches and see if it will work.
If you do not like the existing fsusb application, you can rewrite
it in python with pyusb (which is based on libusb) but you do not
need a kernel driver.
pyusb:

Hex file parsing  in pyk by Mark Rages. He is using the Bitpim
libusb wrapper which IMHO is not as good as pyusb.
