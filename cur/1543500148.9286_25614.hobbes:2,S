We _do_ make our own rules about stability. For example, according to mine,
2.2.7-ac2 is the only 'stable' kernel after 2.0.36, and then not for our
production targets.
I don't much mind if there are bugs in subsystems I don't use, but
crashes/wedges/reboots/data-loss/corruption in subsystems I _do_ use lead me
to brand it unstable. Not unreasonable, I should think.
