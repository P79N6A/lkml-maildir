More parens == easier to review.  So
	a && b & c
should be
	a && (b & c)
to clearly delineate the separate expressions to the human eye, and also
make it clear to the reader that the '&' is intended, and not a typo
that should have been '&&'.
Anytime you see a long string of 'if' conditions, and the operators
vary, add parents for readability.
