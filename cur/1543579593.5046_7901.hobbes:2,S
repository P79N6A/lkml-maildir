Michael Kriss <kriss@fnal.gov> is having this problem. I think this
problem may be very specific to his network setup. I couldn't duplicate
his problem. My guess is for his case, every ping sent is a loss of
a potential working retry packet. He is using Solaris NFS sever with
Linux client. I had an impression that packets from Solaris NFS server
was dropped quite often. I don't know what happened.
