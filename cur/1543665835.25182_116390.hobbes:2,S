Well it seems that I2C has to be configured into the kernel, not
a module, for it to get built. Something seems screwed up with
the configuration. I started, again, with a new kernel tree, configured
from scratch, answering all the questions in `make config` <whew>,
instead of `make oldconfig` with the previous ".config" file. At
least it looks like it might build the stuff. I am currently building
the base kernel (bzImage) again. The kernel builds fine. That's what
I am running. I just can't get all my stuff working because the ieee1394
hardware driver won't build.
The system clock is within a few seconds of NIST and is not set
during the day. It gets set at 2:00 AM every morning by crond. The
hardware clock is updated afterwards.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
