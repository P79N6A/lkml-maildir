Of course.  My point was that if it does not, it's a bug in the BIOS.

Of course, but the kernel has no way to know whether a device should be
edge or level triggered unless you have a driver for that device.  And
even if you do, I don't know that there is an API in kernel to say
set_irq_mode(IRQ_EDGE) (though there could be).

I think default is PIC-compatible which is edge by default.  I think.  I
don;t have the book here.

I know ACPI can get the information with the _PRS and _CRS methods.  The
OSPM core should probably be re-programming the (A)PIC appropriately.  Of
course, that depends on the BIOS vendor getting the ACPI correct, too.
