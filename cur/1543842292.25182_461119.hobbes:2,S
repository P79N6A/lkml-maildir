I'd prefer not take this way. The ACPI driver model is already mess
enough, let's don't make it worse. We are converting the ACPI driver
model to Linux driver model, this will make the attempt difficult.
We can let the motherboard driver not bind to your device (say we didn't
register the motherboard driver, but just reserve the resource of the
deivce). Is it ok to you? (I remember Bjorn said he wants to reserve the
mem region of the device too).
Thanks,
Shaohua
