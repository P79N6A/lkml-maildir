Wow, I'm glad you send a reply. I've been looking into RMA'ing this
board and that would mean 3-4 weeks without a mobo, and I'd especially
hate to think it's actually not a hardware problem after waiting that
long. Something I did notice you said was about the IOMMU, which I
guess i should have mentioned in the first place errors out in the
beginning of the dmesg.
I get this same dmesg message in all kernels I have tried so far
(vanilla and -mm) 2.6.13+
Maybe I should compile it out for now? Unfortunately this lockup isn't
predictable, so I'm forced to just tool around until things lockup
(usually happens between 15 minutes and 12 hours :))
Also, I am merely a layperson. I just took a quick look over
http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/26094.PDF
and it's unreadable by myself.
