Good point.  This Configure.help for 2.4.18pre4aa1 may be better:
--- linux-2.4.18pre4aa1/Documentation/Configure.help	Tue Jan 22 21:25:55 2002

   Select this if you have a 32-bit processor and more than 4
   gigabytes of physical RAM.
 
+User address space size
+CONFIG_1GB
+  If you have 4 Gigabytes of physical memory or less, you can change
+  where the kernel maps high memory.  
+
+  Typically there will 128 megabytes less "user memory" mapped 
+  than the number in the configuration option.  Saying that 
+  another way, "high memory" will usually start 128 megabytes 
+  lower than the configuration option.
+
+  Selecting "05GB" results in a "3.5GB/0.5GB" kernel/user split: 
+  On a system with 1 gigabyte of physical memory, you may get 384 
+  megabytes of "user memory" and 640 megabytes of "high memory" 
+  with this selection.
+
+  Selecting "1GB" results in a "3GB/1GB" kernel/user split: 
+  On a system with 1 gigabyte of memory, you may get 896 MB of 
+  "user memory" and 128 megabytes of "high memory" with this
+  selection.  This is the usual setting.
+
+  Selecting "2GB" results in a "2GB/2GB" kernel/user split:
+  On a system with less than 1.75 gigabytes of physical memory, 
+  this option will make it so no memory is mapped as "high".
+
+  Selecting "3GB" results in a "1GB/3GB" kernel/user split:
+
+  If unsure, say "1GB".

 HIGHMEM I/O support
 CONFIG_HIGHIO
   If you want to be able to do I/O to high memory pages, say Y.
