I first experienced total lockup with 2.6.0-test4-mm5 and have now tried
a few different ones. -test4-mm4 works, test4-bk2 works, test4-mm5
locks, test4-bk3 locks, test5-mm1 locks.
Nothing shows in the logs, and the lock occurs while doing random things
but only after a few seconds - minutes after i logged in to X.
sysrq don't work either.
It is an Compaq Evo 1020v and configs etc. can be found at:
