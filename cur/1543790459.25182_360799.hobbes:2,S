Here you mean that you allocated memory from kmalloc which corresponds
to some pages and then you are dealing with those pages ! right ? Then
you can use alloc_page/pages to get the page directly or there is some
reason for not to use them ?
AFAIK kernel keeps the seperate virtual addresses range for mapping
HIGHMEM to ZONE_NORMAL (PKMAP_BASE to PKMAP_BASE + LAST_PKMAP) which
is from the area called as VMALLOC_RESERVE used for holding temporary
mappings and kmalloc like rountines returned memory will never be
unmapped or at-least I havn't saw this behaviour.

If you got page/memory from the kernel functions like
alloc_page/kmalloc then they are not unmapped and if they unmapped in
any case (which I think won't) then kernel is responsible to mapping
them back when ever you will be going to use it !
