Ingo, I agree with Linus.  My recollection of when we moved
to 2.0 was that the major number reflected the user<->kernel
ABI.  I have no problem with a version 2.42 if things stay
stable that long.   I hope they don't but that is another
issue.
Version 3.0 implies incompatibility with binaries from 2.x
The distributions can play around with version numbers
reflecting the GUI interface, libraries or installers but
the kernel major version should stay the same until binary
compatibility is broken.  When we move old syscalls (such as
32 bit file ops) from deprecated to unsupported is when we
increment the major number.
It may be that 2.7 will see the cruft cut out and be the end
of 2.x but 2.5 isn't that.  So far 2.5 is performance
enhancement.  Terrific performance enhancement, thanks to you
and many others.  But it isn't adding major new features nor
is it removing old interfaces.  In many ways 2.6 looks like
a sign that the 2.x kernel is getting mature.  2.6 means
users can expect improvements but don't have to make big changes.
2.6 is an upgrade, 3.0 would be a replacement.
