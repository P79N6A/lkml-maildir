2303 is pretty good (in fact by usb serial standards outstanding). It has
all the internal locking needed for now and right down to killing
lock_kernel entirely outside of open/close (which is going to hit
everything).
Only fixme I have tagged for it is
- if you set an unsupported baud rate it reports it set rather than the
one you got
Which is a trivial mend for someone who has suitable docs (its marked
FIXME: at the right spot)
