This is probably better, yes.

get_process_data(3), not get_process_data(2), I hope :-) In any case,
you probably want to preserve the ability to read the table in
multiple steps, possibly sacrificing any atomicity assurances a single
operation may (or may not - they're expensive) give.

Doable, but I'm not sure about its usefulness: zombies should be the
rare exception, so under normal circumstances, they don't load your
system in any significant way. Now if you have an application that
sometimes goes berserk and spawns lots of zombies, you probably want
to kill the application anyway.
In the case where you have an application that constantly leaks
zombies, compressing zombie state is only postponing the problem.
What you want to do there is either to force it to reap its
zombie-children, or to kill the zombies entirely (after all, their
parent doesn't seem to be interested).
It may be feasible to sneak a call to waitpid(...,NULL,WNOHANG) into
the process space of the parent using ptrace. This would nicely solve
the problem of broken but unfixable applications without adding extra
code to the kernel.
For killing zombies, you may want to consider implementing a
SIGZOMBIE, which would be equivalent to a SIGKILL, except that it's
only delivered to zombies. This may, however, open a discussion
similar to the one on /proc/nzombies ;-)
