For the CPU controller I was working on, (a fast access to) such a list would 
have been valuable. Basically each task has a weight associated with it
(p->load_weight) which is made to depend upon its class limit. Whenever
the class limit changes, we need to go and change all its member task's 
->load_weight value. 
If you don't maintain the per-container task list, I guess I could still
work around it, by either:
	- Walk the task table and find relevant members, OR better
	  perhaps
	- Move p->load_weight to a class structure
