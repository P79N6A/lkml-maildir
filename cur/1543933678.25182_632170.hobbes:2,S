Uh, right. We already know that your northbridge, mmconfig, CRS, and this 
device combine to always return 0001 for the Vendor ID. If we loop on 
getting that, we must time out.
I'd actually bet that the hardware bug is actually that any device that 
gives a CRS response the first time will have its Vendor ID appear as 0001 
on subsequent mmconfig accesses, which means that it's actually a bus 
quirk that probably only affects mmconfig access to something in the 
conf1-visible space. The only per-device aspect would be that it uses CRS 
(possibly correctly), and that doesn't mean that mmconfig won't be safe in 
general for the device, or even that it won't be necessary. Actually, we 
already know that per-driver enabling mmconfig is broken: sky2 is one that 
wants to opt in but there are also reports of the Vendor ID 0001 bug with 
it.
