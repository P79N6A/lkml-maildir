Just to clarify an apparent misunderstanding that has snuck into this
thread:
1) There are quite a few people/groups out there who are using TIPC's
socket API, so the protocol as a whole is being used and should remain
in the kernel.
2) There are portions of TIPC's native API which are intended for use by
driver programmers, but which are not being used by any code that is
currently in the kernel.  While removing these API's from TIPC will only
impact these "freeloaders", it has the potential to discourage future
programmers who *do* want to contribute their work to the kernel by
removing API's that are apparently necessary/useful when doing coding of
this sort.
Regards,
Al
