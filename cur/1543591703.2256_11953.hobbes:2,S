I'm implementing start_thread for the VAX port and am wondering does
start_thread have to return to load_elf_binary? I'm working on the init
thread and what is happening is it is returning the whole way back to the
execve caller .. which I know shouldn't happen.....
so I suppose what I'm looking for is the point where the user space code
gets control... is it when the registers are set in the start_thread? if
so how does start_thread return....
On the VAX we have to call a return from interrupt to get to user space
and I'm trying to figure out where this should happen...
Dave.
