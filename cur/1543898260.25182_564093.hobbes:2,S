Subject: [PATCH 2/3] make cancel_xxx_work_sync() return a boolean
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/1/66

Change cancel_work_sync() and cancel_delayed_work_sync() to return a boolean
indicating whether the work was actually cancelled. A zero return value means
that the work was not pending/queued.
Without that kind of change it is not possible to avoid flush_workqueue()
sometimes, see the next patch as an example.
Also, this patch unifies both functions and kills the (unlikely) busy-wait loop.
