	Your compiled object module might be a derived work, hence its
distribution would be restricted by the terms of the GPL version 2.
Your source code file would not be a derived work (under certain
currently widely-held assumptions about interface copyrights), and
hence could be distributed without restriction by the GPL.
	Usual disclaimer:  I am not a lawyer.
