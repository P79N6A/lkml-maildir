No, since the kernel has no way to ask for input. Imagine a two-seated
machine with two keyboards, mice and monitors, one terminal at each serial
port, three users logging in using XDM and one disconnected screen session
on tty6. Who's going to be asked? And in case of X11 or XDM: How should the
kernel authenticate to the user's screen?
