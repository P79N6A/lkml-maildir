There is no "power monitor" in a PC system (at least not that is visible 
to the drive) -- if the drive needs it, it has to provide it itself.
It's definitely the responsibility of the drive to recover gracefully 
from such an event, which means that it writes anything that it has 
committed to the host to write; anything it hasn't gotten committed to 
write (but has received) can be written or not written, but must not 
cause a failure of the drive.
A drive is a PERSISTENT storage device, and as such has responsibilities 
the other devices don't.
Anything else is brainless rationalization.
