I already have a solution for this, I'll have one thread sleep for
exact 10ms and then post an event,  another thread will do the 
processing (I'm writing a RTP library, I have to send/recieve RTP
packets in the right interval) then wait for the event. In this
way, the processing thread will wake up at the moment of
(10ms - the time used to do processing).
Increasing HZ maybe another solution. but I don't the performance
implication.
