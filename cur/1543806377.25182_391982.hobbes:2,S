No.  I think tey would salivate to be able to work on Linux stuff with 
Linus.  Wilson Sonsini, who was on the Novell Board at the time, directed
the lawsuit against me at TRG -- he nailed me no matter what squirming I 
did.  I have had other dealings with them.  They would do a great job
for Linus.

Not likely.  Our building is right next to them and over the past few 
months, there's fewer and fewer cars in the parking lot and more lights
turned off in offices in the evening.  I doubt they are going to do 
anything to Linux.  IBM is going to get nailed on some stuff, but I think
Linux is unaffected, at least those parts RedHat, Suse, and the rest of 
us need to keep going.
