These are OPS codes not COMMAND codes.
OPS codes are passed in known public SPEC - COMMAND codes.
This is the reserved space of DIAGNOSTICS in ATA-ATAPI devices.

Good then let them lock the areas that need to be lock.

The bitch and scream over a $0.01 per drive addition.
$0.01 * 1.5e7 * number of models per year == MILLIONS per company.
This is what pisses me off the most, people dictating to me about what
they general have proven to know little or nothing about.
Sorry Peter, but I a really raw with this subject.
Please I am going to go get some sleep for two days, please go ask anyone
else here for help because they know all that I know.
Good night.....
