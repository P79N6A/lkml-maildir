    So, as a rule of thumb, anytime I compile or install such
programs, I should set an include search path for them.

    I don't use a distro, I have a do-it-yourself linux box, part of
it is from an old Debian 1.3.1, but most of it is hand-made. I
compile my own kernel-related tools. I suppose that, for each package
I install that may be kernel-related, I should do 'grep "<linux/"'
just in case...

    Nice. But I don't feel it is current practice... For example,
hdparm doesn't set such include search path, iproute2 does but
modutils (up to 2.4.27, AFAIK) doesn't... I don't know many more
examples, so I may well be wrong.
