I am assuming that you changed EXT2 filesystem in a way that only name
of the filesystem and magic number is changed by you, now when you are
creating filesystem through mkfs.ext2 it is writting the magic number
of EXT2 in your file/drive so you must change mkfs.ext2 utility too
means it should write your specified magic number on file/drive during
filesystem creation and you will be able to mount it. You can get the
source of mkfs and other ext2 related utilties from e2fsprogs (just
google for it).
