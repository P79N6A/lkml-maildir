Actually it's a read from userspace which allocates a page which goes into
direct reclaim which discovers a locked buffer on the tail of the LRU and
then waits on it.
And if he's especially unlucky: while he waits, some other process
continues to pound more writes into the queue which get merged ahead of the
one he's waiting on, up to a point.
(I don't know if 2.6 does much better in this regard.  It is supposed to. 
Has anyone tested for it?)
