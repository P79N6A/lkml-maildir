This seem too much. If all arch have a so big CONFIG space, I
think that your idea can do some improvement.
But: user don't see the difference. Do you think that
developers
would like your proposal? (If arch maintainers agree, you can
try to publish your patch)

But in 2.5.x the config.in are centralized, thus also
Configure.help sould be centralized.
And in this case I think that a big file hurts nobody.

In 2.5.2 kernel. What We don't know is when 2.5.2 will be
released!

In 2.4: No. Distribution expect a stable interface.
In 2.5 will be the new CML2.
Again if arch maintainer agree with your proposal, you can
change
the CML2. Not so difficult (and you change only in one place
for all interfaces (olconfig/config/menuconfig/xconfig)

This change is too big for 2.4 kernel.
