Subject: [PATCH 3/33] i386 setup.c: Reserve kernel memory starting from _text
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/1/121

Currently when we are reserving the memory the kernel text
resides in we start at __PHYSICAL_START which happens to be
correct but not very obvious.  In addition when we start relocating
the kernel __PHYSICAL_START is the wrong value, as it is an
absolute symbol that does not get relocated.
By starting the reservation at __pa_symbol(_text)
the code is clearer and will be correct when relocated.
