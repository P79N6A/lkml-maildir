Yeah, under this huge pile of "real work" stuff that I have right now,
sorry about the delay...
It would be fine to get USB working earlier, but we need PCI, and pretty
much everything else up and working first in order for it to be there,
so I don't know how well it would work out.
And yes, it is annoying about how some machines you are locked out of
keyboard support for a long time, I don't know what to really do about
it.
Feel free to mess with the linking order if you want to try to reduce
the delay and see how it works out.
thanks,
