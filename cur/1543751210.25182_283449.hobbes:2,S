Well, the prevailing theory tends to start along the lines of "find out
how to reproduce the problem...". ;-)
Looking at the NFS code, I can attempt a wild guess about what may be
happening: there may be a race when pressing ^C in the middle of a
blocking NFS lock RPC call, and if so, the following patch will fix it.
Try it, and see whether or not it fixes your problem, but if it doesn't,
then I agree with Chris' suggestion of replacing those "panic()" calls
with BUG_ON()s.
Cheers,
