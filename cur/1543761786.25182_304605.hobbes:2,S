Subject: [PATCH] Fix compile warning in drivers/pnp/resource.c with !CONFIG_PCI
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/21/133

With !CONFIG_PCI I get following warning:
  CC      drivers/pnp/resource.o
drivers/pnp/resource.c:24: warning: `pnp_skip_pci_scan' defined but not used
Two ways to fix this, first one would be to simply #ifdef the
variable. But the variable
in question is not (according to cscope) actually used outside this
one other place (and reason why it became a warning now is that Adrian
made it static), and so the code inside CONFIG_PCI is actually relying
on the fact that the variable is implicitly initialized to 0.
So the patch just deletes the variable.
