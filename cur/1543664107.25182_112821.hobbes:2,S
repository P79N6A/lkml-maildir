Well, it runs fine, but I get truly freaky performance results. My machine
might have gone wacko on me or something - the patch seems perfectly simple
to me. Kernbench is all over the map - user and elapsed way up, system is
down. Ummm .. probably all too strange to be true, and I've made a mistake,
but if some more sane person than I could run a quick test, would help.
Thanks,
