I don't mind either way.  I was hoping to go with something that I've 
actually tested, but I don't see any reason why Becky's patches won't 
work in principle for Xen.  I'm on vacation at the moment, but I can 
test things out when I get back in a couple of weeks and apply whatever 
fixes are needed at whatever stage we're at then.
