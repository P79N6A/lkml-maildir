Understood - but what I'm getting at is more the fact that there
really doesn't appear to be any real implementation of nonblocking
open().  On the socket side of the fence, I would consider a regular
file open() to be equivalent to a connect() call - the difference
obviously being that we already have a handle for the socket.
The end result, however, is roughly the same.  We have a file
descriptor with the endpoint established.  In the socket world, we
assume that a nonblocking request will always return immediately and
the application is expected to come back around and see if the request
has completed.  Regular files have no equivalent.
