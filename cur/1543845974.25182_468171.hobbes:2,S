A quick perusal of the pci-calgary.c in 2.6.18-mm2 doesn't find a single
comment explaining where "6, 8, a, c" comes from, which makes that 14 seem
"magical" - are the 3rd Calgary's busses e,f, 10, and 12? It makes me wonder
why they didn't just blow 2 "reserved" numbers to make it mod 16 and an easier
decode. ;)
