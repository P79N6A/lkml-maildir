If it is so (sorry for catching the thread in the middle), then it means
that there is either a bug in the keyboard driver, which should be fixed,
or a bug in the keyboard controller, which can have other side-effects
and so it should be at least reported.

I am not telling that the message has to stay intact -- it should be reworded
and rate-limited, but not hidden.

No, just notice that his hardware is buggy and that it's probably a harmless
bug -- like we already do in many other cases (e.g., the 3Com drivers sometime
tell the user that his card has broken DMA, so it's going to use PIO instead).

If it's not a laptop, they can do.
When I am considering a keyboard to buy and I see this message, I usually
choose a different one immediately, because it often means that the keyboard
will react badly to fast typing.
				Have a nice fortnight
