	NO. When you set the SO_REUSEADDR, you are telling the kernel that you 
intend to share your port with *someone*, but not who. The kernel has no way 
to know that two processes that bind to the same UDP port with SO_REUSEADDR 
are the two that were intended to cooperate with each other. For all it 
knows, one is a foo intended to cooperate with other foo's and the other is a 
bar intended to cooperate with other bar's.
	That's why if you mean to share, you should share the actual socket 
descriptor rather than trying to reference the same transport endpoint with 
two different sockets.
	Of course, in this case you don't even need SO_REUSEADDR/SO_REUSEPORT since 
you only actually open the endpoint once.
