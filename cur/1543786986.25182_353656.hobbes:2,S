Hi everyone,
I am trying 2.6.9 kernel to boot with boot time option as numa=fake=2
On intel xeon 64 bit 4 way SMP environment with 4GB Physical memory
but I am getting an error
Kenel penic : not syncing : kmem_cache_create() failed
I want to know whether numa=fake=N option is only available with AMD
opteron 64bit installation? Or It is supported with Intel also? If yes
then is there any limit of Physical memory after which this is
supported?
Devesh
