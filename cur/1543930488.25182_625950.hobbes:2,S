And if you are an observer this is important.
Equally messed up is a our status in /proc at that point.  Which
says our sleeping process is a zombie.
I'm thinking we need to do at least some of the thread group leadership
transfer in do_exit, instead of de_thread.  Then p->group_leader->exit_state
would be sufficient to see if the entire thread group was alive,
as the group_leader would be whoever was left alive.  The original
group_leader might still need to be kept around for it's pid...
I think that would solve most of the problems you have with a dead
thread group leader and sending SIG_STOP as well.
