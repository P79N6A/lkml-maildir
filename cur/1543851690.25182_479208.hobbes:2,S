Subject: [GIT PATCH] USB fixes for 2.6.18-rc4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are some USB bugfixes for 2.6.18-rc4.
They include a number of fixes for different regressions reported (the HID
bitmask issue and the Kconfig issue for USB network drivers) as well as some
suspend issues and of course a few new device ids and unusual_devs entries were
added.
All of these changes have been in the last few -mm releases.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-usb-devel mailing list, if
anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
