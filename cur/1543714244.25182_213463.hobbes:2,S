Hi Kurt,
The context was actually sched-domains regressions vs numasched,
which might possibly arise in any SMP (even simple dual) system.
So in this case we are interested in -mm regressions compared to
the official 2.6 tree.
2.6 regressions versus 2.4 are still interesting, but a 3.5% drop
in kernel compiling is probably due to HZ=1000 and rmap, although
I think you can expect improvements in rmap overhead soon... try
2.6.5-aa5 if you are interested.
