Of course.  I meant "grounded in reasonable security assumptions."
If you really are the admin then you will find another way of
"getting into" the pspace.
But really, what does "enter" mean in this case?  If you can see
the processes so as to kill them, is that all you need?  After all
this is distinct from the filesystem namespace - the pids are the
only thing that's distinct.  So the only thing that I can see you
preventing by preventing "entering" the pspace is starting a new
process with a pid valid in the other pspace.
