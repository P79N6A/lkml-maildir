You're misunderstood.  The vmlinux binary and the initramfs are stored in the
same protected memory area when you execute a kexec -l, but they are separate
and distinct files.

initrd is old, initramfs is the new way to go, but they effecitvley do the same
thing, and while the initramfs _can_ be built into the kernel, it can also be
separately managed (which is what most distros tend to do, AFAICS).
