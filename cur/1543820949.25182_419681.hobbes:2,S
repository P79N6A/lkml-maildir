Subject: [PATCH 005 of 5] md: Fix 'rdev->nr_pending' count when retrying barrier requests.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/27/419

When retrying a failed BIO_RW_BARRIER request, we need to
keep the reference in ->nr_pending over the whole retry.
Currently, we only hold the reference if the failed request is
the *last* one to finish - which is silly, because it would normally 
be the first to finish.
So move the rdev_dec_pending call up into the didn't-fail branch.
As the rdev isn't used in the later code, calling rdev_dec_pending
earlier doesn't hurt.
