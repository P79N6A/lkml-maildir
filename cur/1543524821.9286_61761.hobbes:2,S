Subject: Lockup on 2.4.42 with Intel PIIX3

Hi folks,
  I tried out 2.4.42 to experiment with the FireWire support, but I ran into
a problem with (I think) the IDE driver instead.  The machine locks up
during the boot phase.  The last thing on the screen is
PIIX3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 69
PIIX3: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
It does *NOT* identify ide1, as 2.2.12 does, and the system locks up at
this point, with no further output.  I thought the two video capture cards
might possibly be interfering with the IRQ, so I pulled them out.  No luck.
The only thing I've tried that works is to completely remove IDE support from
the kernel, but then of course I can't use any IDE devices.  I'd be immensely
grateful for any suggestions you folks might provide.  Please CC any responses
to me (gross@cse.ucsc.edu).
There are other problems (e.g. XFree86 gets confused about the Elsa graphics
card, but the latest bleeding-edge version allows me to specify the PCI slot,
which works around that problem), but so far this is the only one that has me
stuck.
The machine is a slightly dated Dell workstation, with some unusual hardware.
It is a mostly-SCSI system, with one ATAPI CD-ROM that seems to be the trouble.
