Right.
8 Bit = 1 Byte
1024 Byte = 1 KB
1024 KB = 1 MB
1024 MB ...
So we are talking about that, beacuse the X-Byte is defined as 1024 and not
as 1000 of the previous step.

What _you_ mean can not be determied from me.
But *I* would mean 1.048.574, otherwise I would say the 9xxx number or say
nearly 1 MB.

That's the sense of them.
