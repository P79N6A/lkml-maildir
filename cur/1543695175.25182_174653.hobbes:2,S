* struct inode reuse between msdos and umsdos is FUBAR.  Allocation/freeing
  of inode is controlled by its ->i_sb.  So is location of struct inode within
  the allocated object.  That's where umsdos got really broken and AFAICS the
  only more or less sane way to handle that crap is separation of msdos and
  umsdos inode/dentry/superblock, so that the latter would refer the former.
The rest is more or less trivial; compile fixes, mostly from prototype changes
for methods.  Inode reuse problem is where the real PITA is and it will take
a serious work to fix.
