Alan:
Though you did use the part of the patch that fixes the bad
PCI_DEVICE_ID_PROMISE_20246 comparison, you didn't pull in the part that
gets rid of the LBA48-disabling hack.  In 2.4.20-pre5-ac3 in
init_hwif_pdc202xx() the switch statement there still does:
   hwif->addressing = (hwif->channel) ? 0 : 1;
for cases PCI_DEVICE_ID_PROMISE_20265 and PCI_DEVICE_ID_PROMISE_20267.  
That line of code prevents probe_lba_addressing() from setting
addressing to 1 for the primary channel which kills LBA48 addressing
there.
In 2.4.20-pre5-ac4 in init_hwif_pdc202xx(), the switch has been changed 
to some if-statements but the effect is the same:
    if (hwif->pci_dev->device == PCI_DEVICE_ID_PROMISE_20265)
	hwif->addressing = (hwif->channel) ? 0 : 1;
(and similarly for PCI_DEVICE_ID_PROMISE_20267).
Is there a good reason why LBA48 is still disabled here?  The only
reason I can think of should have been fixed in -pre5-ac3.
With LBA48 disabled anyone running 160GB drives on the primary channel
are going to experience more nasty disk corruption.
