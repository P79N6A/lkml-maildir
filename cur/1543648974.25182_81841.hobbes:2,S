One idea would be to sigsegv the program which is doing a chroot with open
fds :)

well, you can only changeroot in a subdir anyway, so this is not the point
that freebsd is allowing a chroot in a chroot. As far as I know they simply
solved the break out issue. 
BTW: kill on open fd would solve the breakout issue, too.
