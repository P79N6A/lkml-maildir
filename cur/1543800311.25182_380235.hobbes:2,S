They're taken straight from the register names in our chip spec.  I can
squish them to lowercase-only, if that seems important.

Yes, that hunk is redundant.  Thanks for spotting it.

It's usually called with a dtime of 1, but there's an added delay in one
place.
I just rewrote that routine, so it's now a one-liner that does a read
which waits for writes to the chip to complete.  The sole caller that
wanted an added wait calls udelay itself now.

specialised.

Sure.

That file will be taken out and put to sleep.

Ugh, braino.

Other people have pointed out that our page-pinning code is horked.
We'll find a saner alternative.
Thanks for the comments, Greg.
