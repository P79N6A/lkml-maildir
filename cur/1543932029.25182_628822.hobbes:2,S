If the attacker gets full administrator-level access on your machine,
there are a gazillion ways the attacker can prevent other admins from
logging on.  This patch can't prevent that.  It sounds like this patch
is trying to solve a fundamentally unsolveable problem.
A useful slogan: "Don't forbid what you cannot prevent."
