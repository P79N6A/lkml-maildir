Interesting: personally I consider the cacheline sharing a feature,
and unless you've done something special, the static declaration
should be interlaced too, no?
If you don't want interlaced, you should make your type
____cacheline_aligned for alloc_percpu, or use
	__alloc_percpu(ALIGN(sizeof(x), SMP_CACHE_BYTES), SMP_CACHE_BYTES)
Aside: if kmalloc_percpu uses the per-cpu offset too, it probably
makes sense to make the per-cpu offset to a first class citizen, and
smp_processor_id to be derived, rather than the other way around as at
the moment.  This would offer further speedup by removing a level of
indirection.
If you're interested I can probably produce such a patch for x86...
Thanks for the results!
Rusty.
