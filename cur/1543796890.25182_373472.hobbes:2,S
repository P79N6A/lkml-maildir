Heh, no.  Please go look up why devfs was deleted, this one broken
feature is not a good enough reason to keep it around.

That's the latest stable udev release in Gentoo, yes.  Do you have
problems with that one?  If so, please file them in the proper Gentoo
bugzilla.
And yes, Gentoo is lagging a bit on the latest udev support (073 is in
the tree, but 076 has been released.)  That's totally my fault, and you
can blame my lack of free time to do what is needed to fully intregrate
it (due to some very good snow in our local mountains...)

That is not true, it was not.

Have you tried this?  What "new kernel module" are you speaking of?
