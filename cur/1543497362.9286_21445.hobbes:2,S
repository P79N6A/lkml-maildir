Actually this is the easiest part. Normally you will want to put a
  tristate 'Terratec Active Radio ISA Stdalone' CONFIG_TTACTRADIO_ISA
or something similar into the Config.in file of the corresponding
driver directory. If you want your driver markes as development
you may have to do a
  if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" ]; then
    tristate 'Terratec Active Radio ISA Stdalone' CONFIG_TTACTRADIO_ISA
  fi
Then you have to add a
  ifeq ($(CONFIG_TTACTRADIO_ISA),m)
  M_OBJS += ttactradio.o
  endif
to the Makefile in the same directory. To get the help on your driver
into the config menus add something like
  Terratec Active Radio ISA Standalone
  CONFIG_TTACTRADIO_ISA
    This is currently only useful as a module. It is a very
    nice driver and you can really listen to foo&bar on 0815kHz.

Sorry on that one.

It's amazing, but somehow it always works out ;-]
