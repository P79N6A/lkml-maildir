I assume you mean the strace ? That was the only attachment, and it just looks 
like shiploads of schedule() from the get time of day. Yes?

Err funny you should say that; that's what O17 did. But it hurt because it 
would never allow a task that used a full timeslice to be next==prev. The 
less I throttled that, the less effective the antistarvation was. However 
this is clearly a problem without using up full timeslices. I originally 
thought they weren't trying to schedule lots because of the drop in ctx 
during starvation but I forgot that rescheduling the same task doesnt count 
as a ctx. 
Also I recall that winegames got much better in O10 when everything was 
charged at least one jiffy (pre nanosecond timing) suggesting those that were 
waking up for minute amounts of time repeatedly were being penalised; thus 
taking out the possibility of the starving task staying high priority for 
long.

Hmm also sounds fudgy.

Well if it works well who cares. My starvation throttler (O17) hurt 
interactivity though which is why I dropped it. 
I'm guessing I need to rewrite the O10 semantics to work with nanosecond 
timing instead. I'll have to give that a go.
Thanks for your comments Mike. Hopefully the munchkins can stack high enough 
;)
