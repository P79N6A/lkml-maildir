udelay is supposed to be reliable. If someone runs a new kernel and has 
no TSC (which might happen even on modern hardware or with notsc) _and_ 
finds that udelay is not calibrated well enough then that's a kernel bug 
we want to fix.

iffy in what way? Again, we might be hiding real udelay bugs.

Not changing the kernel _at all_ is what is the "lowest risk" option. If 
the kernel is changed, it should be tested - and if we have a buggy 
udelay, that should be fixed - because it could cause many other bugs in 
other drivers.
yes, there are always risks in changing something, but using udelay is a 
common-sense consolidation of code.

gcc triggered timing changes can easily add up to a LOT more - 
especially if a loop is involved and especially on older hardware. 
Remember, 1 microsecond is just a handful of instructions on real old 
hardware. The kernel's timings are _not_ immutable, never were, never 
will be.
