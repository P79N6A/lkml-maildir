You might need to check sb->s_root in here after acquiring sb->s_umount. 
Otherwise the fs may have been unmounted while the semaphore was being waited
upon.
About half of the s_umount grabbers perform that check.  The others might be
buggy.  I'm not sure - it's all rather gunky in there and hard to tell what
the rules are.
