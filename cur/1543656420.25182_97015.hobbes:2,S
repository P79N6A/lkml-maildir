Would you mind doing a s/consistent/coherent/g?  This has been
misnamed in the PCI DMA interface all along, but I didn't think it's
worth breaking drivers because of it.  But since this is a new
interface, there is no such issue.
(Consistency says something about memory access ordering, coherency
only talks about there not being multiple values for a given memory
location.  On DMA-coherent platforms with weakly-ordered memory
systems, the returned memory really is only coherent, not consistent,
i.e., you have to use memory barriers if you want to enforce
ordering.)
Thanks,
