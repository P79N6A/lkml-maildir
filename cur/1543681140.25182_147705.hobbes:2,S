Please don't.  I think page flipping was a bad idea.  I think you'd be 
better off to try and make the data flow up the stack in small enough 
windows that it all sits in the cache.
One thing SGI taught me (not that they wanted to do so) is that infinitely
large packets are infinitely stupid, for lots of reasons.  One is that
you have to buffer them somewhere and another is that the bigger they 
are the bigger your cache needs to be to go fast.
