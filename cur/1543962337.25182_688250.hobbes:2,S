Im not treating it as a backup, what i want, is to make sure that if 1
disk dies, the data is still intact and ill hopefully be able to run
with 1 disk till the newly ordered one arrives - and while i naturally
will keep offsite backups of most important data, it is certainly far
easier to simply rip out a faulty disk, and put in another, instead of
restoring from backup from scratch..
So my question remains.. Is md raid1 not suited for this need? would it
be safer to run in non-raid1 mode and daily(maybe hourly) rsync
everything over to the second disk?
