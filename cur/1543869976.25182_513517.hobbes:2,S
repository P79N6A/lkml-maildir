lockdep tells us that we have a possible circular locking dependency.
The output below is incomplete since our console driver deadlocked on
del_timer()...

    <4>[ INFO: possible circular locking dependency detected ]
    <4>2.6.20-23.x.20070222-s390xdebug #1
    <4>-------------------------------------------------------
    <4>bash/1447 is trying to acquire lock:
    <4> (base_lock_keys + cpu#5){++..}, at: [<000000000013b686>] timer_cpu_notify+0xd2/0x3a4
    <4>
    <4>but task is already holding lock:
    <4> (base_lock_keys + cpu#7){++..}, at: [<000000000013b67c>] timer_cpu_notify+0xc8/0x3a4
    <4>
    <4>which lock already depends on the new lock.
    <4>
    <4>
    <4>the existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is:
    <4>
    <4>-> #1 (base_lock_keys + cpu#7){++..}:

The problem in this case is the cpu hotplug code in kernel/timer.c:
	migrate_timers(...)
	...
	old_base = per_cpu(tvec_bases, cpu);
	new_base = get_cpu_var(tvec_bases);
	local_irq_disable();
	spin_lock(&new_base->lock);
	spin_lock(&old_base->lock);
takes per-cpu locks once in A-B order and once in B-A order, depending
on from which cpu another one gets killed. This should be ok, since
migrate_timers() can only be active on one cpu and therefore no deadlock
should occur...
The same problem is present in kernel/hrtimer.c btw.
Any idea how to fix this? Just adding a lockdep_off/on between the two
spin_lock()s will fix this, but I don't like it.
Btw.: this is the call trace that lead to the deadlock when printing the
lockdep message. Looks like it is a bad idea if the console driver needs
to take a lock that lockdep wants to complain about. But I don't think
this needs to be fixed.
