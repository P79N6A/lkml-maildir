Subject: [PATCH] libata: fix for sata_mv >64KB DMA segments

Fix bug in sata_mv for cases where the IOMMU layer has merged SG entries
to larger than 64KB. They need to be split up before being sent to
the driver.
Just for simplicity's sake, split up at 64K boundary instead of 64K size,
since that's what the common code does anyway.

As per discussion on IRC, it was really caused by mv_fill_sg() not
handing SG entries larger than 64K properly. Below patch fixes it to
behave like ata_fill_sg() instead.
Works OK here after some light testing (restoring my corrupted root
filesystem and running a few fscks on it, among other things).
Thanks,
Olof
