X86_PAE should depend on X86_CMPXCHG64, not the other way around.
I asked Andi Kleen about this on IRC, and he said:
<freitag> the reason was that i didn't want to hack everybody's magic
MSRs into the old verify_cpu.S
verify_cpu.S is dead on i386 (replaced by arch/i386/boot/cpucheck.c)
which does have the flags enable MSR tweaks; it is still being used for
APs on x86-64.  However, in the meantime it should be safe to remove
this dependency from i386.
