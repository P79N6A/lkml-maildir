Hello,
I get the following syslog messages on a NFS client under high NFS load:
Dec 29 10:12:15 zahn vmunix: nfs_stat_to_errno: bad nfs status return value: 39
Dec 29 10:12:46 zahn last message repeated 117 times
The load is produced by executing
   
http://www.snafu.de/~zahn/test2.c
on an NFS-mounted remote directory.
The server exporting the directory is Linux 2.1.102, NFS server
is the Universal NFS Server 2.2beta29. There are no interesting
syslog messages on the server.
The client system is based on Dual-PentiumII, 233MHz,
Gigabyte GA-686LX2 motherboard. The kernel is compiled with
gcc version egcs-2.91.60 19981201 (egcs-1.1.1 release).
Client and server are connected by a 100Mbit LAN connection.
Find the kernel configuration used at 
http://www.snafu.de/~zahn/autoconf.h

Regards
  Steffen
