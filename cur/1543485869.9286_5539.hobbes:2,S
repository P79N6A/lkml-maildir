English was my absolute worst subject, but does not sic mean something like
"that's what the author REALLY wanted to say" or "said in context?"  In
other words, the sic is probably there because whoever wrote "Play operation
oborted" really wanted it to say "oborted."  Did I just prove my English is
real bad or what?
From dictionary.com:
sic \Sic\, adv. [L.] Thus.
        Note: This word is sometimes inserted in a quotation [sic], to call
attention to the fact that
        some remarkable or inaccurate expression, misspelling, or the like,
is literally reproduced.
                                                        Source: Webster's
Revised Unabridged Dictionary
        sic adv : intentionally so written (used after a printed word or
phrase) v : urge a dog to
        attack someone [syn: set]
-----------------------
Maybe it should be "Play operation oborted [sic]" instead of "Play operation
oborted (sic)"? [sic]
