Just like most people aren't seeing problems with the O(1)
scheduler and the 500 lines of kludges piled on top that
keep it working ok in 2.6 - in most cases.
Compare with Con's staircase scheduler, that removes those
500 lines of code, appears to work just as good in the common
situations and deals with a few extra corner cases.
The VM is in a similar situation, with Too Much Magic(tm) all
over the place, just to keep the system working smoothly in
normal workloads.
It would be a minor miracle if the VM - with all the magic
tweaks - still worked fine for workloads that don't behave the
way the VM expects them to.
THAT is what replacing the current code with a self-learning
algorithm is all about, IMHO.

Haven't seen many of those, to be honest.  The majority
of the VM problems I get to see are people running a
workload the kernel didn't expect - a workload the kernel
wasn't prepared to handle...
