[1.] One line summary of the problem:
raid1 spare rebuilding does not resume after the reboot ( 2.6.18)
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
----------------------------------------------                    
1. When a mirrored raid is created, this raid1 is in the 'State : clean, resyncing'.
md0 : active raid1 sdd[3](S) sdb[2](S) sda[1] sdc[0]
      244198448 blocks super 1.2 [2/2] [UU]
      [>....................]  resync =  2.1% (5146880/244198448)
finish=773.1min speed=5150K/sec
-- the most important attributes are obtained with: mdadm --detail /dev/md0
Raid Level : raid1
Persistence : Superblock is persistent
State : clean, resyncing
Rebuild Status : 2% complete
UUID : 301792c7:4c8e2854:19398dbf:f9d5253e
Events : 0
Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State
       0       8       32        0      active sync   /dev/sata1
       1       8        0        1      active sync   /dev/sata2
       2       8       16        -      spare   /dev/sata3
       3       8       48        -      spare   /dev/sata4
2.  Each individual block device in the array has a state written in its
superblock (mdadm --examine /dev/sataX ):
/dev/sata1: (original)
                     State : active
                     Array Slot : 0 (0, 1)
                     Array State : uU 
/dev/sata2: (mirror)
                    State : active
                    Array Slot : 1 (0, 1)
                    Array State : uu       
/dev/sata3: (spare)
                    State : active
                    Array Slot : 2 (0, 1)
                    Array State : uu      
/dev/sata4: (spare)
                    State : active
                    Array Slot : 3 (0, 1)
                    Array State : uu      
3. When /dev/sata2 is pulled out from the box, md driver kicks this disk out of
the arrray and starts reconstruction and recovery, migrating to 'State : clean,
degraded, recovering' where a spare `jumps in` to support recovery effort:
md: syncing RAID array md0
md: minimum _guaranteed_ reconstruction speed: 1000 KB/sec/disc.
md: using maximum available idle IO bandwidth (but not more than 5000 KB/sec)
for reconstruction.
md: using 128k window, over a total of 244198448 blocks.
md: unbind<sda>                                                                
             <--- kick out: 1st step
md: export_rdev(sda)                                                           
            <--- kick out: 2nd step
md0 : active raid1 sdc[0] sdd[3] sdb[2](S)

      [>....................]  recovery =  0.1% (295168/244198448)

  <--- the spare disk which jumped in to support recovery
       2       8       16        -      spare   /dev/sata3    
The only managed device that changed its state is the spare, and its superblock
is changed, as well as the metadata for the raid1.
Now, instead of rebooting the box, stop the raid1, then restart it (this is
exactly what`s happening on reboot, isn't it ?)
4. Stop the recovering raid1: ( mdadm --manage -S /dev/md0 )
This is how raid1 behaves:
md: md0 stopped.
md: unbind<sdc>
md: export_rdev(sdc)
md: unbind<sdd>
md: export_rdev(sdd)
md: unbind<sdb>
md: export_rdev(sdb)
mdadm: stopped /dev/md0
NOTE: md0 is out of kernel, but the metadata about it is persistent on each
disk: no mdadm info can be extracted from /dev/md0 in stopped state.  
5. Restart the stopped raid1 ( mdadm --assemble -R /dev/md0 )
mdadm: failed to add /dev/sata3 to /dev/md0                                    
     <----- *** the second spare, sata3  is not added to array md0
md: md0: raid array is not clean -- starting background reconstruction      
<----- md device was in a recovery state (not clean), before the shut down.
Device or resource busy
raid1: raid set md0 active with 1 out of 2 mirrors                             
        <----- this is wrong, md0 should be set to 'State : clean, degraded,
recovering', not 'Active' 
md: syncing RAID array md0                                                     
             *** either some wrong bit is set on assembly (restart), or the
wrong bit was stored on stop
md: minimum _guaranteed_ reconstruction speed: 1000 KB/sec/disc.
md: using maximum available idle IO bandwidth (but not more than 200000 KB/sec)
for reconstruction.
mdadm: /dev/md0 has been started with 2 drives and 2 spares.                <---
*** wrong info, the spare that jumped in to support rebuild, is treated as a
normal mirror disk
md: using 128k window, over a total of 244198448 blocks.                       
                              number of spares and number of drives is bad
md: md0: sync done.                                                            
                <---- what the hack, resync/recovery should start ?!
md0 : active raid1 sdc[0] sdb[2](S) sdd[3]                                     
        <---- sdb is a spare (S) , OK

6. Check the superblock of each individual disk ( mdadm -E /dev/sata1 ):
/dev/sata1: (original)           CHANGED TO:
