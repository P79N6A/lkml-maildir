We use GNU99 all over the place, or are you going to clear up all the
statement expressions and such other fancy gnu extensions to the
language as well?
I'm really not seeing why this would be wrong, other than the standard

Harvey can just use -Wno-return-void, or someone can modify sparse to
have that default disabled for STANDARD_GNU[89]9.
