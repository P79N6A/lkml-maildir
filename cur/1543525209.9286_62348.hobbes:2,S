Folks,
     I would like to understand and document the Hardware Abstraction of Linux
Kernel.
     I know that Linux does not have a formal HAL. I do not know if "arch"
directories provide a consistent
     common interface to the remaining architecture independent code.
     The code is massive and discouraging. I would like some tips from the
expert community
     here on how to attack the problem.
     Any links to existing documentation are also welcome.
Raghu
