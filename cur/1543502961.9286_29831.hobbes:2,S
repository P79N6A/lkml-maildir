I haven't looked at your patch or how the kernel currently handles OOM, 
but is there / should there be a reserved amount for root processes kind
of like there is a reserve for root on ext2 filesystems? Then Root could
continue to do things but normal user would be blocked / killed...
Now if it's a root task that is causing the OOM, that is another problem
altogether... (Hopefully, most memory pigs would not be running as root 
in the first place...)
