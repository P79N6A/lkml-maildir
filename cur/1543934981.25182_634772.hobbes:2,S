Distribution installers and live CDs like Knoppix even manage to 
magically assemble a suitable configuration (e.g. autodetecting which 
modules they should load) without asking the user any questions.
The information the user has to give when configuring his kernel is 
whether he wants to connects USB disks - whether or not the 
implementation of the kernel driver uses the in-kernel SCSI layer we can 
easily handle automatically without bothering the user.

It sounds strange that what you call the "the best we can do" would be 
much worse than what we are currently doing...
The current status quo is that a user e.g. only has to know that his 
ethernet controller is a "Broadcom 440x/47xx", the fact that a Sonics 
Silicon Backplane bus is used on the card is handled automatically by 
kconfig.
