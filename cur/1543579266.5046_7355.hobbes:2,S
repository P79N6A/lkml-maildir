Uhh, what if you have this situation:
interrupt (level triggered)
 enter interrupt handler
   printk (can re-enable interrupts?)
     enter interrupt handler
       printk (can re-enable interrupts?)
         enter interrupt handler
           printk (can re-enable interrupts?)
             ....
So surely this isn't a new problem?
