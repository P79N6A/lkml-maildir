Trivially easy when two processes share the same FS namespace.
Consider two files:
$ ls -l /tmp/a /tmp/b
-rw------ 1 owner owner xxxxx /tmp/a
-rw------ 1 owner owner xxxxx /tmp/b
One file serves as a clock.  Note that the permissions deny all
access to everyone except the owner.  The owner user then does this,
intentionally or unintentionally:
for x in 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
do
	rm -f /tmp/a /tmp/b
	case "$x" in
	0 )	rm -f /tmp/a;;
	1 )	touch /tmp/a;;
	esac
	touch /tmp/b
	sleep	2
done
And the baddie does this:
let n=1
let char=0
while (($n < 8))
do
	while [ ! -f /tmp/b ]; do
		sleep 0.5
	done
	let char=((char << 1))
	if [ -f /tmp/a ]; do
		let char=((char + 1))
	done
done
printf "The letter was: %c\n" $char
This is one of the classic TEMPEST problems that secure systems have
long had to deal with.  See, at no time did HT ever raise its ugly
head ;-)
