Alan, I replied to you a few weeks ago (pre20 times) when you asked me why
I was sending you this patch. (perhaps you didn't receive my email). What I 
observed was that my netraid card had a 0xXXXX8 base address and the patch
aligned that address to 16 bytes :
|Bus  0, device   2, function  1:
|  Unknown class: Intel OEM MegaRAID Controller (rev 5).
|    Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  BIST capable.  IRQ 10.  Master
Capable.  Latency=64.  
|    Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xf0000000 [0xf0000008].
as you see, the board is found at 0xf0000008, but used aligned to 0xf0000000.
my server currently works with that patch, but I'm sure it won't boot anymore
if I apply this 2.2.18pre25 alone. 
just in case, here it is again.
Cheers,
Willy
