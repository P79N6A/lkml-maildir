The I8000 again (sigh). You apparently have SMP or UP IOAPIC enabled.
In this case, 2.4.10 will enable the local APIC if the BIOS didn't.
To help debug the freeze, please try the patch below: it will cause
the kernel to log any APM event sent to it from the BIOS. Run this
in an SMP&UP_IOAPIC-less kernel. Do one of the actions above that
would freeze the APIC-enabled kernel (like the key sequence to enter
the BIOS setup screens). Check the kernel log. Did APM log any event,
and if so, which one?
My suspicion (from this and other reports) is that the Inspiron 8000's
BIOS SMM can't handle an enabled local APIC, or it passes an APM event
that apm.c ignores. Either case can be lethal.
