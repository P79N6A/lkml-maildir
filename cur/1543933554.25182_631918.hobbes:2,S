It seems to me that reading from (u)random disturbs the entropy pool, so 
the more consumers reading from the pool in unpredictable ways, the 
better.  As it is currently implemented, it lowers the entropy estimate, 
but the pool will have MORE entropy if several applications keep reading 
/dev/random periodically when they need random bytes instead of just 
reading it once to seed their own prng.  IMHO, it is the entropy 
estimate that is broken, not the TLS library.
