Hi,
  does anybody idea what my CPU does under 2.4.0-test7-pre2? Even if I run top
after booting with 'init=/bin/sh', it shows 0% user, 100% system, while 'top'
running at 0.1% of CPU, and sh,kswapd,kflushd,kupdate doing nothing...
  Kernel is compiled as SMP, but run on UP APIC-less machine. /proc/interrupts
does not show any excessive events... Currently no APM is compiled into kernel
(as I though that it could be source - it was not...)
  I'm not sure which version started doing that, as I do not track versions
too closely at home. If I run 'while true; do :; done' in bash, it will say
that 99.8% user, 0.2% system, 99.9% using bash, so it is probably only problem
with accounting of idle time.
