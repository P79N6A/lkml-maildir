If it's not a bug then
- this comment from include/linux/fs.h should be deleted
  #define NR_RESERVED_FILES 10 /* reserved for root */
- books should be updated
- people's mind also who believe kernel reserves fd's for superuser
Kernel from 2.1 plays lottery in this regards. And this would be
another sad fact that the kernel is exteremely poor *out of the box*
in regards security and relaibility ...
