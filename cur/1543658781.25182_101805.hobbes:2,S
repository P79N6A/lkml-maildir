It is compiled for 64GB highmem support. And just to refresh, I have seen this exact behavior on stock 2.4.19 and stock 2.4.17 (no patches on either of these) also compiled with 64GB highmem support.

I posted a snapshot of sar data collection earlier today showing selected stats leading up to and just after the live-lock occurs (which is noted by a ~2 minute gap in sar logging). After the live-lock is released, the only thing that stands out is an unusual increase in runtime for kswapd (as reported by ps).

If you don't have any individual processes that need to be particularly
large (eg > 1Gb of data), I suggest you just cheat^Wfinesse the problem
and move PAGE_OFFSET from C0000000 to 80000000 - will give you more than
twice as much lowmem to play with. I think this might even be a config
option in RedHat kernels.
Martin.
