    Kernels 2.2.0 and 2.2.1 crash while performing partition check.
    Partition check:

    Partition check:
     sda: sda1 < sda5 sda6 sda7 sda8 sda9 sda10 >
     hda: hda1 hda2 hda3 < hda5 hda6 >
     hdb: hdb1 hdb2 < hdb5 hdb6 hdb7 >
    (output from 2.0.35 dmesg)
    The machine works fine with linux 2.0.35 (and also worked fine with all
    older versions of linux :-)) ) and also with windows nt.
    I hope this information is somewhat useful,
Yes, somewhat. But probably it would be much more useful if you
translated the numbers for us: look in System.map or ask ksymoops
for a translation of the call trace: [<c01232fd>] ...
Probably that would tell us immediately whether the bug is SCSI code
for ncr53c8xx, or in genhd in partition code, or at an entirely
different place. (And what partition types have you configured?)
