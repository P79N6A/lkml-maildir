I'm having trouble sorting out which report is for which BIOS (and some 
of them don't have any dmesg posted), but I believe in these cases that 
memory region is indeed reported as reserved by the BIOS, and no PCI 
resources should end up allocated there. So I'm not sure why fiddling 
with PCIBIOS_MIN_IO would have any effect (other than by accident).
I wonder if this is the culprit (from Arthur Erhardt's dmesg):
pnpacpi: exceeded the max number of mem resources: 12
pnpacpi: exceeded the max number of mem resources: 12
which means we're ignoring some of the memory reservations. I wonder if 
some IO reservations are also being ignored?
Why do we have this silly hard limit of number of resources anyway? If 
we just ignore random reservations provided by the BIOS, we shouldn't be 
surprised if things break randomly. This warning at the very least 
should be much louder (i.e. "Warning: This problem may break your system")..

I suspect it's board specific. Looking at the DSDT for my A8N-SLI 
Deluxe, that SMIP region is defined at 0x442E (and is reported as 
reserved). This BIOS doesn't write there in the _PTS method like the 
ones in the report apparently do though.
