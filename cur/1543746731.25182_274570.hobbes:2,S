Greetings to you,
This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I
believe it is only a day that people meet and become
great friends and business partners.  My name is Mr.
James  Williams, An Accountant working in a bank here in
Benin Republic West Africa.I write you this proposal
in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the
information I am about to reveal to you.  Like I said,
I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as
your assistance is required as a foreigner.  
I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head
office, but last December I was transfer to one of our
Bank branch in Cotonou who passed on, so that was how
I became the present head accountant in the bank ,
during when I was auditing all the account  and I
discovered a fortune .As I resumed duty, I discovered
an account with total sum of $25,500,000 million that
has not been operated on for the past 4 years.  From
my investigation, I found out that this account
belongs to one Late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev a Russian big
time Oil dealer, who unfortunately lost his life in
the Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000. You will read
more news about the crash on visiting these site; 
http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/031500/usn_LA0703.001.shtml
and
http://news.1chinastar.com/ll/english/61934.shtml.
I have kept a close monitoring of the account since
then and nobody has come forward to claim the money as
next of kin to the late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev meaning that
no one is aware of the account.  I cannot directly
take out this money without the help of a foreigner
and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance
to claim the funds and share it with me.  As the head
accountant bank  my bank branch, I have the power to
influence the release of the funds to any foreigner
that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with
the correct information concerning the account, which
I shall give you.
I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the
next of kin to the account.  There is practically no
risk involved, the transaction will be executed under
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from
any breach of law.  
If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how
you wish us to 
share the funds in percentage, so that both parties
will be satisfied.  Contact me as soon as you receive
this message if you feel we can work together, so we
can go over the details.  Thanking you in advance and
may God bless you.Please, treat with utmost
confidentiality.  I wait your urgent response.
Regards,
James Williams.
