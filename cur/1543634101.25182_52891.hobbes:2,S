Yup.  Sorry about the "_centisecs" thing.  That's a bit anal, but
I tend to think that it's best to be really explicit about the
units, make it a bit easier to use.  I don't know how many times
I've had to peer in fs/buffer.c to remember what those dang numbers do.
Possibly, "seconds" may be sufficiently high resolution for
these things.  But I wasn't sure - maybe someone wants to
run the kupdate function five times per second?  Dunno.
There are some departures from 2.4 tradition which are worth
mentioning here:
- There is no range checking on the settings.  (But a divide-by
  zero isn't possible, so I think that's OK)
- Unlike the 2.4 bdflush settings, these parameters are not
  updated in a single hit.  So if you modify them by a large
  amount while the system is under heavy writeback load, perhaps
  some whacky things will happen if you create an irrational
  intermediate state.  But that's quite unlikely.
- Unlike 2.4, the settings are scaled by HZ.  So that bdflush
  tuning tool whose name I forget will no longer make kupdate
  run ten times too fast on Alphas.
