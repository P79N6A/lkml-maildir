Then you are probably going to have to invent some out-of-band protocol
in order to do so. Creating such a protocol shouldn't be a hard task,
but getting all those server manufacturers to adopt it afterwards
probably will be be. ;-)
Alternatively, if you can make a good case (and write a decent RFC), you
might be able to persuade the IETF working group to add this feature
into a future minor version of NFSv4.
