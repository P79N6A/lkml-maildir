Not that IDE disks would be more reliable, just that you couldn't see the
disk errors until it was too late.  :-)  
However, given the IDE disk prices, you can afford to replace them more
often.  
Also, with SCSI drives, some people see sense errors, and correctable media
defects, and mistakenly assume it is a 'disk failure'.

Oh, and having spent much of last night and this morning dealing
with multiple SCSI disk failures, and having seen about 5% of
ours fail in a year, I'm rapidly seeing the light on IDE.
