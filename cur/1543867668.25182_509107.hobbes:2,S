One way to communicate a return code is by making the sysfs interface
file read/write, and having the read callback give a return code.  For
an example of this, you can look at drivers/pci/rpadlpar_sysfs.c and
rpadlpar_core.c.
It would still be nice to have some way from the adapter sysfs directory
to list/examine logical ports.  Symlinks would work, but it would be
even nicer to have a new kobject per port with attribute files for
logical id, state, etc.
