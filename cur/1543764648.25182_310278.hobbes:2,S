So long as there is only one pathname in a record, you don't need
nul-terminators to be allow spaces in the name.  The rest of the record
is well known, so the pathname is just whatever is left after chomping
off the rest of the record.
It's only the support for embedded newlines that forces you to use
nul-terminators.
Not worth it - in my view.  Rather, do just enough hackery that
such a pathname doesn't break you, even if it means not giving
full service to such names.
