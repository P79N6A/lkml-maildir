At a first glance they look good.

I understand this, but I still don't like the solution.
But unless I can send a patch with a better solution, this is nothing I 
can complain about...
There are two things that might be changed even now:
The "default m if DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE" is something I do not like that 
much, especially considering that embedded users caring about kernel 
size are likely to use CONFIG_MODULES=n.
Another thing is that we might want to let DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE depend on 
EMBEDDED - for the average non-embedded user kernel size doesn't matter 
that much, and CONFIG_DVB_FE_CUSTOMIZE=y might often cause user 
confusion (similar to e.g. KEYBOARD_ATKBD depending on EMBEDDED, 
although many users might use USB keyboards).
