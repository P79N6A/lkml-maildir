Marcelo,
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hedrick/ide-2.4.25/hpt366-0.37.patch.bz2
Fixes fifo dma data corruption on RocketRaid404
Fixes native HPT372 detection/setup for HPT372/HPT372A/HPT372N
HPT372N's previous code seems kooky, but then again do not have specific
hardware rev in question.
Kind Regards,
Andre Hedrick
