Allows any i/o initiated between the first sync and the remount r/o to 
complete.  Remember that r/o mounting doesn't stop i/o.  It only stops you 
from writing to the fs at the vfs layer.  Once a write/modification has 
entered the fs driver it will get written no matter what, unless the 
"reboot" sysrq is triggered in which case the kernel just reboots 
immediately.
Maybe it is just paranoia on my part but I have gotten used to hitting 
Alt+PrtScr+S, +U, +S, +B so I do it automatically.
Best regards,
