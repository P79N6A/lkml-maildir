Subject: [patch 0/6] lightweight robust futexes: -V4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is release -V4 of the "lightweight robust futexes" patchset. The 
patchset can also be downloaded from:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/lightweight-robust-futexes/
no big changes - docs updates and the tidying of futex_atomic_cmpxchg() 
semantics.
Changes since -V3:
 - added Documentation/robust-futex-ABI.txt (Paul Jackson)
 - fixed two mistakes in Documentation/robust-futexes.txt.
   (found by Paul Jackson)
 - added an explicit access_ok() check to the futex_atomic_cmpxchg()
   function. This is not needed in the place it's currently used (there 
   we have already validated the access_ok() range validity of the 
   userspace pointer), but it's good to do it nevertheless, just in case 
   the function gets used elsewhere in the futex code.
