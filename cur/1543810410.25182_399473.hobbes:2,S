I did write some time ago that the most probable cause for the Linux bug is that
Linux is sending uninitialized data for the amount of bytes that pad to 12 byte.
Libscg is the first application ever, that always correctly deals with CDB size
as it started to do so in August 1986 which is before any other SCSI generic 
transport has been available.
