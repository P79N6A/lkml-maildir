It is not. The bzImage is another format that handles bigger images (big z
Image). It still uses gzip, not bzip2 (as many surmise by the name).
bzip2 is not feasible, as it uses _lots_ of memory (something like 1Mb
minimum) to uncompress, and when uncompressing the kernel you are working
within the fabled 640Kb of the PC.
