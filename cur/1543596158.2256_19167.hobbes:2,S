Yep. I've added a few more dependencies like that to the map drivers too. I
heard rumours that someone else had done similar changes, but nobody sent me
a patch so those rumours can't be true.
I'll wait for Steven to fix this up and then send all those changes to
Linus.
Assuming, that is, that nobody else takes it upon themselves to keep
resending small bits of the pending changes, gratuitously making it harder
to me to keep in sync.
