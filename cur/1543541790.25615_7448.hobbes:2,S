Ah - I may have been responsible for removing the `#if 0',
see the linux-kernel post of 9 Jun 2000 with subject `[PATCH] cdrom stuff'.
In my patch I had
+       if (!CDROM_CAN(CDC_CD_R | CDC_CD_RW))
                goto use_toc;
but the current kernel code has (in cdrom_get_last_written())
        if (!CDROM_CAN(CDC_CD_R | CDC_CD_RW | CDC_DVD_R | CDC_DVD_RAM))
                goto use_toc;
Do things improve if you go back to my version?
