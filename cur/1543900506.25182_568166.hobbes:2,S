But it's already there.  Deleting it now is pointless.
If someone really wants to unify it, better to do:
#ifndef PCIBIOS_PLATFORM_ENTRIES
static inline void pcibios_add_platform_entries(struct pci_dev *dev)
{
}
#endif
in <linux/pci.h> and then PPC can #define PCIBIOS_PLATFORM_ENTRIES
and do its own funky stuff.  This weak symbol stuff has its uses, but
I don't think this is an appropriate use.
