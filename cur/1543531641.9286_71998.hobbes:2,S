No - malloc() doesn't allocate MEMORY, it allocates ADDRESS SPACE to
put memory in later. This may not be what you wanted, but that's what
it does.

No, you were actually asking for address space to put memory in.
That's where the problem arises.

It hasn't allocated any memory. It has allocated address space, and
indicated that AT THE TIME you COULD have filled it. You chose not to,
and when you then changed your mind, it was too late.

No - they fail as a result of a system problem. They will also fail if
I unplug the machine, pour coffee over the CPU, type in "shutdown -r
now" at the console as root....

If your database is so broken it can't handle being terminated by a
signal, you need a new database. There is certainly nothing
"non-recoverable" about it being terminated unexpectedly!
