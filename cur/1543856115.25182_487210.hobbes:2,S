Ahh.. I can't believe I missed this again.  A Port Multiplier is
attached to your ata2 which is probably a sil3726 or 4726.  Why this
device fails initial reset is unknown yet.  Anyways, with proper PMP
support, this problem will go away.  So, this isn't really a ahci issue
and there's nothing wrong with your disks either.  I'll ask SIMG why
this happens with the PMP.
