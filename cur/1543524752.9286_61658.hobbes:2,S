I have a customer running 2.2.9-19mdk on a Compaq Deskpro Pentium II
PC in Linux Mandrake release 6.0.  
Their clock changes very strangely during bootup:
Feb 2 22:45:17 sal9000 kernel: Real Time Clock Driver v1.09
Feb 2 22:45:17 sal9000 kernel: PCSP 1.3 measurement: maximal samplerate 79545 Hz, 18356 Hz used
Feb 3 09:16:47 sal9000 rc.sysinit: Checking filesystems succeeded
Feb 3 04:16:56 sal9000 rc.sysinit: Mounting local filesystems succeeded
Feb 3 04:16:56 sal9000 rc.sysinit: Turning on user and group quotas for local filesystems succeeded
Feb 3 03:45:08 sal9000 date: Wed Feb 2 22:45:08 EST 2000
Feb 2 22:45:08 sal9000 rc.sysinit: Setting clock (utc): Wed Feb 2 22:45:08 EST 2000 succeeded
Once the machine is up and running the clock continues to jump
around, even if they force it to the correct time using hwclock or
xntpd. 
Here is the output to the "cat /proc/rtc" command:
rtc_time : 08:56:10
rtc_date : 2000-02-04
rtc_epoch : 1900
alarm : 10:00:10
DST_enable : no
BCD : yes
24hr : yes
square_wave : no
alarm_IRQ : no
update_IRQ : no
periodic_IRQ : no
periodic_freq : 1024
batt_status : okay
Can anyone suggest what might be wrong?  I couldn't see any mention of
this as a known bug.  I thought we'd try upgrading to 2.2.13 (probably
a good thing anyhow), and then perhaps changing CONFIG_RTC.
