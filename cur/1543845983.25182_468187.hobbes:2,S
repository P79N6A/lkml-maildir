The same Windows driver supports all of:
CK804SSS="NVIDIA nForce4 Serial ATA Controller"
MCP51S="NVIDIA nForce 430/410 Serial ATA Controller"
MCP55S="NVIDIA nForce 590/570/550 Serial ATA Controller"
 From looking at the patch it seems to only use the ADMA code for CK804 
only. Probably the others use the same programming interface (though who 
knows if they implemented a totally different one in the same Windows 
driver). I guess you could try hacking it to use ADMA on that controller 
and see what happens..
I have an nForce4 board and it would be nice if we could have working 
NCQ, though I haven't really played with libata before. I may experiment 
with it a bit, though - Jeff, what kernel was this patch against? It 
obviously won't apply to current -mm, that nv_host_desc structure it is 
patching is gone for one thing..
