Great, then use debugfs for it.  Please, don't put debug stuff like this
in sysfs, that's not what it is there for.  You can do whatever you want
in debugfs :)

Use debugfs please.

using the sysfs interface wrong :)
Simple, one value per file is what sysfs is for.  Use debugfs for
debugging stuff.
