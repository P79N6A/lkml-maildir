There's a consensus that if there's *any* choice, new /proc files as
well as new ioctls shall not be introduced. So if there's management
needed (disclaimer: I don't own such a card), then this interface needs
to be introduced as a generic interface, which might be used by any
further drivers. We've just had this situation for some RAID cards,
where the vendor wanted to introduce a (specific for his devices)
interface. Either do it correct (as of best current practice), or don't
do it at all.

Well, again, if this features can only used by your hardware (and
there's proof that no other vendor will add these features *ever*), then
an own interface is okay. But if there's a possibility that a different
vendor *might* introduce these as well, then a generic interface needs
to be build (with first of all only one user: your driver).

That's a plan. Good to head :-)
