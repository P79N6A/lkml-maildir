This is a reverse-engineering. Linux Kernel README should contain either:
* an information how to compile the HTML docs or
* a pointer to a step-by-step guide how to do it
a message "reverse-engineer it yourself" is not acceptable for Linux
Kernel README.

stylesheets ***" in stdin:-1: reality object pointer "DocBook stylesheets" not
defined while parsing natural language "English" at lng_parse.c: 56788
Please supply either a guide how to compile HTML docs for kernel into README
or a pointer to it INCLUDING SETTING UP DOCBOOK STYLESHEETS ON USER'S
MACHINE
