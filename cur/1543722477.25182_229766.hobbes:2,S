It's difficult to anticipate the number of zones required for a per-cpu
data structure to be periodically resynched with the zones. The
counters, both global and per-zone are purely for reporting purposes
and have no impact on functionality in this series.

Largely for the benefit of ramfs. As you pointed out, rd.c's blkdev
pagecache requires similar treatment. The net effect of these is that
wired pagecache pages don't appear on the LRU at all. This makes the
assumption that all wired pagecache is memory-backed and never needs
to be written to its backing store, which AFAICT is true in all cases.
