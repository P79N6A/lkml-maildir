Trapping DMA and ignoring will make sense. I don't know how it can be done.
Toggle write permissions in TCE table and handle it in exception handler?

What does ignoring DMA mean here? Acutual DMA does not take place but device
thinks DMA is complete? 
Trapping DMA and ignoring in kdump kernel (if possible), seems to be better
than letting DMA happen. This will reduce chances of corruption of second
kernel.  
Can you please give little more details in terms of how to trap DMA. I think
chandru should be able to write a patch for this.

Right now ppc64 just uses the TCE tables from first kernel and allows the 
older DMA's to finish. Then they free up some TCE table entries (2K) to 
make space for DMA entries from second kernel. 
Mohan, please corret me, if I am wrong.
Thanks
