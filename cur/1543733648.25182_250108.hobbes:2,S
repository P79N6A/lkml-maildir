Hi,
We are thinking of implementing the generation of linux kernel crash dumps in 
elf core file format. This will enable users to analyze kernel crash dumps 
using gdb. It should be good tool to complement KGDB. KGDB could be used 
during development stage for live kernel analysis and LKCD-GDB could be used 
with the same capabilities for analysis of customer problems and in house 
release testing.
We would like to know if people think this will be useful or they are more 
comfortable with current way of kernel panic analysis using existing LKCD.
Any ideas/suggestions/pointers to existing work in this area are most welcome.
Thanks.
