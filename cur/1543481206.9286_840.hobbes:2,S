It might be the same problem that bit me some time ago with NIS:
Linus has uid/gid 1046 1046 or so set in the kernel tar archive.
If this doesn't match in /etc/passwd neither in NIS it causes
a NIS request for _every_ file. Seems that misses don't get 
cached with Linux glibc NIS support. 
I found out by running strace tar and tcpdump, and fixed it with entries
torvalds in NIS passwd and group :-)).  
Does your problem persist after chown -R root:root
/usr/src/linux-2.2.0pre7 ?
