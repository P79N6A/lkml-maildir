That's what I assumed, and that's why I forced fsck.

I feel like a fool now. You're absolutely right, my RAM is corrupted.
Sorry for the trouble folks, I'm very happy to come to the conclusion I
can rely on EXT3. Now I have to start worrying about how to detect RAM
corruption before it screws up my data next time.

That's what I assumed, and I'm glad to see it's still true.
Once again, sorry for the trouble.
