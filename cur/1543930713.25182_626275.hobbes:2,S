Note that I foresee potential problems with this. These GPIO drivers
need I2C or SPI to be initialized before they can load. However on some
systems, I2C or SPI buses are hanging off GPIOs, meaning that these
GPIOS need to be initialized before I2C or SPI, respectively. I can
imagine weird setups where for example an SPI bus would be driven by an
I2C-based GPIO chip, or vice-versa. I sure hope that nobody does this,
but you never know... And I'm not sure how we would possibly support
this.
