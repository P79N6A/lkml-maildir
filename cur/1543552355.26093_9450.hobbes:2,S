1) some process allocates gobs of memory
2) the kernel swaps out memory from all processes
3) some of the other - partly swapped out - processes
   wake up and need to be swapped in
4) these other processes have to ALLOCATE MEMORY to be
   able to page in parts of themselves ... this can be
   very slow at times

Rik
