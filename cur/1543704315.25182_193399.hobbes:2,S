I tried out the 2.6.1 kernel quickly and it did not exhibit the same
obvious problems oopsing with dma and the ide controller as the latest
2.4 kernels (on my hardware at least).  It booted up nicely without a
problem on unmodified source.  Whether or not the problem occurs for
other types of hardware I can't say.
