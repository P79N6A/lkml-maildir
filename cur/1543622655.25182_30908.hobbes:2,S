First the good news - it built the ALSA modules correctly this time around.
And I suspect these are trivial fixes:
    USB storage fails by trying to reference "address" member of a 
scatterlist, which has a vdma_address (MIPS) or a dma_address (x86) 
(didn't check others).
        USB Mass Storage is modular, all sub drivers selected.
        This affects datafab.c and jumpshot.c.

    Some FSs seem to have trouble with dparent_lock - fatfs.o, at least, 
caused depmod to say "undefined symbol."
        I believe the following patch fixes it.
