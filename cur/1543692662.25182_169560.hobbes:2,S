In that case I'm going to need a bit of education as to what the whole
thing is trying to do.
If FBIO_ATY128_SET_MIRROR is really supposed to be passing a pointer into
the ioctl then we *want* the encoded ioctl number to be different for
32-bit-compiled userspace and 64-bit-compiled userspace, don't we?
