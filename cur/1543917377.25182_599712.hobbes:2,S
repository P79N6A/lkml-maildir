that's a bit funny-looking.  Are CONFIG_FAIR_CGROUP_SCHED and
CONFIG_FAIR_USER_SCHED mutually exclusive?  Doesn't seem that way.  if
they're both defined then CONFIG_FAIR_USER_SCHED "wins".
Anyway, please confirm that this is correct?
I'll switch that to `#elif defined(CONFIG_FAIR_CGROUP_SCHED)'.  We can get
gcc warnings with `#if CONFIG_FOO', and people should be using `#ifdef
CONFIG_FOO', so I assume the same applies to #elif.
