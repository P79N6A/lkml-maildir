Would it be interesting to support mounting of external file systems (be 
it USB, NFS or whatever) in a way that automatically forces it to ignore 
suid and devices (which are already mount time options)?   The question 
I guess is, how much do you gain over a setuid program (hack?) that can 
handle this?
