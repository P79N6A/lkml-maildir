 CONFIG_CRYPTO_TEST
   Quick & dirty crypto test module.
+
+CONFIG_SOUND_WM97XX
+  Say Y here to support the Wolfson WM9705 and WM9712 touchscreen
+  controllers. These controllers are mainly found in PDA's
+  i.e. Dell Axim and Toshiba e740
+
+  This is experimental code.
+  Please see Documentation/wolfson-touchscreen.txt for
+  a complete list of parameters.
+
+  In order to use this driver, a char device called wm97xx with a major
+  number of 10 and minor number 16 will have to be created under
+  /dev/touchscreen.
+
+  e.g.
+  mknod /dev/touchscreen/wm97xx c 10 16
+
+  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
+  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
+  say M here.  The module will be called ac97_plugin_wm97xx.o.
+
+  If unsure, say N.
