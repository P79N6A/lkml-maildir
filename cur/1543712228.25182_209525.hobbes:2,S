A definition of fibration:

I'm going to have to study math for about a year before I understand all
that, I think.
It's a good thing we won't have to understand "fiber bundles",
"paracompact topological space" and the "homotopy lifting property" to
USE Reiser4.
*grin*
If I missed the discussion or a web page, I am sorry.  But could someone
post a quick explanation or pointer to one about this fibration plugin? 
What does it do and what effects will it have?
