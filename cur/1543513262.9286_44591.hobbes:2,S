  Hi, all. Version 126 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
NOTE: This patch contains the first steps in implementing the new
naming scheme that Linus has required. A future version of the patch
will phase out /dev/sd and similar in favour of the /dev/scsi
hierarchy. Similar changes are planned for IDE and other subsystems.
This is against 2.3.22-pre1. Highlights of this release:
- Always create /dev/pts if CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS=y
- Fixed call to <devfs_mk_dir> in drivers/block/ide-disk.c
  Thanks to Dennis Hou <smilax@mindmeld.yi.org>
- Allow multiple unregistrations
- Created /dev/scsi hierarchy
  Work sponsored by SGI
				Regards,
					Richard....
