  Added CONFIG_HIGHMEM to defconfig.
ChangeSet@1.579.13.4, 2002-09-29 22:02:45-04:00, jdike@uml.karaya.com

ChangeSet@1.579.13.3, 2002-09-28 15:45:58-04:00, jdike@uml.karaya.com
  Missed a change to fixmap.h in the highmem update.

  Fixed highmem support for 2.5.
ChangeSet@1.579.13.1, 2002-09-23 21:43:15-04:00, jdike@uml.karaya.com
  Added highmem support.
  The UML initialization code marks memory that doesn't fit in the
  kernel's address space as highmem, and later sets up the UML data
  structures for it, and frees that memory to the mm system as highmem.
