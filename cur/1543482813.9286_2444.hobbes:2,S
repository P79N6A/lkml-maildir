Subject: My wishlist for 2.3.0 (hope Linus doesn't mind)

Since the topic has come up, I thought I'd publish my wishlist
for 2.3.0:
(1) Fix all serious known bugs in 2.2.X before forking 2.3.0.
(2) Fix serious bugs 2.2.X reported from the field before forking 2.3.0.
(3) Write more documentation in the Documentation/ directory for things
    that commonly confuse people before forking 2.3.0.
(4) Merge some more of the arch/ code back in before forking 2.3.0.
I won't mind if Linus allocates N months on 2.2.X fixes, stability is
good, even if it's a grind to get there.
