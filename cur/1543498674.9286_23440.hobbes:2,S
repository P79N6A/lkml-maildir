Got the following message on reboot of a machines running 2.2.9ac4 and
knfsd 1.3.3b:
rpc.kstatd did not set AF_INET on udp sendmsg. Fix it!
(repeating from memory, exacting phrasing MAY be off.)  I'm too tired
to take a look at what that means right now, but I figured if it's
important then I should report it. If it's meaningless, pretend you
never read this message.
