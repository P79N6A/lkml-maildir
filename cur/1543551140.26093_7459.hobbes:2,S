Doesn't work for all devices.  Also since base_addr is truncated to
16-bits when passed to ifconfig, this gets even nastier for userspace.

...and noone but the driver can trust this information to be pointing to
an up-to-date struct netdevice.
Since struct pci_dev is probably going to morph into a more generic
struct hw_dev, maybe struct netdevice needs a pci_dev member...
