Several people have written scripts over the years to do this. I don't
have one handy, but I suspect the LKML (linux-kernel) archives know.
Note that module overhead is not /too/ bad these days. It used to be
that loading modules significantly affected boot time, but some recent
improvements have helped - including a few fixes to module-init-tools:
binary trie based index files (v3.5), shortened naming (v3.6), etc. I
think that, really, at this point module loading overhead is small.
