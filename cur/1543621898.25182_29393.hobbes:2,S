Last I checked the page-table was 1 megabyte + that origin. Anyways,
it doesn't matter. It is all referenced by labels which are fixed up
by the linker.

The RAM exists and is addressed as linear address space because the
paging bit in CR0 isn't set yet. This is the reason why all the
operations that change or modify paging have to be done in a region
where there is a 1:1 physical/virtual address translation. If the
correct PTEs are present, once the paging bit is set, the stuff
being executed doesn't change, but now exists at the (unchanged)
virtual address.
