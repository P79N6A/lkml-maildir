I just ran the following on my computer :
"
#define LLHIGH(n) (unsigned long) (n >> (8 * sizeof(long)))
#define LLLOW(n) (unsigned long) ((n << (8 * sizeof(long)))  >> (8 * sizeof(long)))
/** internal function: called from the template module's init function */
int myfunc(void){
	unsigned long long int ullint = ((unsigned long long int) 1 << 32) - 1; //
LONG_MAX returns 7fffffff, this at least is a max_long
	unsigned long int ulint = ((unsigned long long int) 1 << 32) - 1;
	printk("a long long consists of %d bits on an x86 (athlon-xp), whereas a long
consists of %d bits\n", sizeof(ullint) * 8, sizeof(long) * 8);
	printk("my test long long reads %.8lx%.8lx; my test long %.8lx\n",
LLHIGH(ullint), LLLOW(ullint), ulint );
	ullint += 1; // will we get overflow or is a long long really > long?
	ulint += 1;
	printk("my test long long now reads %.8lx%.8lx; my test long %.8lx\n",
LLHIGH(ullint), LLLOW(ullint), ulint );
"
"
a long long consists of 64 bits on an x86 (athlon-xp), whereas a long consists
of 32 bits
my test long reads 00000000ffffffff; my test long ffffffff
my test long reads 0000000100000000; my test long 00000000
"
It took a bit longer to get right than I imagined (doesn't it always ;), but at
least here you've got a working example. Enjoy.
cheers,

to the best of my knowledge it has nothing to do with this.
