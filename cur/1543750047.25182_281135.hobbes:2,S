Could you do the "binary OR trick"?
Such that
if (__put_user() || __put_user() || __put_user()) return -EFAULT;
becomes:
err  = __put_user();
err |= __put_user();
err |= __put_user();
if (err) return -EFAULT;
This saves branches, which speeds up code for the common case
and reduces size. Downside is more faults, but this hurts only for
broken software, which deserves this behavior ;-)
This optimization works only if:
 - function returns either zero or exact the same value.
 - we don't mind having all these other calls executed,
   even if the first failed already.
Which is true for __put_user() and __get_user(), 
but works the other way around for __copy_{from,to}_user().
But since 0 is succes on __copy_{from,to}_user(), you
can even do this trick there and have only ONE branch instead
of 3-6 in your code.
You'll find this pattern in many places in the Kernel.
