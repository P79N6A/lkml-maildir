Both ideas, as you say, are ugly workarounds.  The problem is elsewhere (and
it's possible it already got fixed by a patch Ion committed to am-utils very
recently).
I don't like the idea of an amd.conf option to override what should really
be in the mount maps.  How would you tell it which entries to override?
If the problem is that /bin/mount does something that amd's own mount(2)
call doesn't, then Ion and I will fix the linux mounting code in am-utils.
