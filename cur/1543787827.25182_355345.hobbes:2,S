Break it out, sure! I'm not sure which patch to look at, though.

Do you mean "discontig-consolidate0.patch"? Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Hehe, what is this, a beauty contest? =) I agree, but I guess the
reason for this code to be here is that a similar arrangement is done
by x86_64...
I will create a new file. Is arch/i386/mm/numa_emu.c good?

No biggie, I will add a config option.
But first, you have written lots and lots of patches, and I am
confused. Could you please tell me on which patches I should base my
code to make things as easy as possible?
Many thanks,
