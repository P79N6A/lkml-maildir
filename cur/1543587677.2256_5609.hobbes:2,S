And why not do exactly this with init? Have a look in /etc/inittab:
% grep power /etc/inittab
# What to do when the power fails/returns.
pf::powerwait:/etc/init.d/powerfail start
pn::powerfailnow:/etc/init.d/powerfail now
po::powerokwait:/etc/init.d/powerfail stop
You can shut down your machine there, but you can also have it play a
cancan on power failure. It is up to your gusto. And now tell me, why
not choose a similar approach, but instead reinvent the wheel and
create a completely new mechanism?
