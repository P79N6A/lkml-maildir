Dear Sir,
I am having ridiculous problems with Hardware compatibility on Linux.
Recently I bought a Digital-Research card
with the Trio-S3-64V2/DX chip.
I have seen that is a common compatible chip/card for Linux all over
the Internet,
but I haven't had the Server connect with the chip successfully yet.
I had a previous S3-Trio Video card that worked fine,
until the Monitor blew-up.
Am I missing something ?
