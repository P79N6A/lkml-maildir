The message is caused by a change in the code to load a.out (specifically,
ZMAGIC) binaries and libraries.  The new code requires segments in the
binary format to be (memory-)page aligned, i.e on 4k boundaries, in the
file.  This seems to be caused by an alignment change in memory mapping
code.  However, the text segment in a ZMAGIC is always 1024-byte aligned.
For non-aligned aout binaries, the kernel now has a compatibility mode.
In principle, nothing is lost, but the code for the binary isn't shared
any more (through mmap).

You can locate the warnings in linux/fs/binfmt_aout.c and comment
them out.
||  3.  How do I convert the programs?
I guess by recompiling to QMAGIC a.out or ELF.

It turns out that the compatibility code for loading a.out ZMAGIC
libraries (not binaries) forgets to initialise the bss segment.  I found
this after some hard searching and fixed it.  It seems to work well on my
home machine, which now happily runs a.out ZMAGIC libraries under 2.2.13.
The patch for an unmodified 2.2.13 kernel is appended to this message.
It actually seems to make the kernel smaller.  :-) Disclaimer: only
tested on my machine, which is a simple P100/16Mb/partly heavily upgraded
Debian-1.0(?)  linux-2.2.13 system.
Ciao.                                                             Vincent.
