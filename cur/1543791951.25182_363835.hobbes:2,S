Regarding cpumemset and alloc_pages. I recently rechecked
the cpumemset hooks in there and I must say they turned out

In hindsight it would have been better to use the "generate
zonelists for all possible nodes" approach you originally had
and which I rejected (sorry) 
That would make the code much cleaner and faster.
Maybe it's not too late to switch for that?
If not then the fast path definitely needs to be tuned a bit.
