Yes. Since that's going to be ``in the future,'' it makes sense just
to remove it from the keyring after the mount is complete for now.

The salt in eCryptfs is 64 bits (8 octets, per the spec of the
iterated and salted S2K; see Section 3.6.1.3 RFC 2440). Without the
iterated hashing, the raw dictionary generation will require storage
on the scale of 2^64 multiplied by the size of the dictionary. I think
this is big enough to address any attacks that involve pre-computed
dictionaries, as you have already pointed out.
The dictionary attack that I have in mind that I would like to make a
``bit'' harder is the dedicated attack against one particular file. If
an attacker just wants to attack the passphrase on that file, then
without iterated hashing, the difficulty is roughly proportional (in
aggregate) to half size of the dictionary. If the passphrase is weak,
then the file will likely be compromised anyway, but at least an
iterated hash multiplies the amount of work that the dictionary
attacker needs to do by the number of iterations.
The question then is whether the additional hashing effort on the part
of a legitimate user has a good cost/benefit security tradeoff. If the
passphrase is strong and if the user is having to do the iterated hash
on every file in a large directory, then the tradeoff is probably
bad. If the passphrase is weak, the user can tolerate the overhead of
iterated hashing on file opens, and the attacker has limited
computational resources, then the tradeoff might be good. Ultimately,
that is the sort of thing I would like to be configurable via policy
in later versions of eCryptfs.
Keep in mind that, for the current release of eCryptfs, the iterated
hashing only happens once per mount, not once per file, and so there
is very little cost to the user, and it has at least some security
benefit, so why not do it? Note that this will change in later
versions, as a different salt is generated for each file in the
system, but it will also be configurable in later versions.
