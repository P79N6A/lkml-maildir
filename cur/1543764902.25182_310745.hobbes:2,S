Ok. It /does/ work, I've been using the AWACS driver for weeks now, and I 
don't have any stability or audio issues (that I notice), and my Mini is on 
24/7.
People that want sound support on their Minis right away can use this patch 
while waiting for the rework of the drivers, without fear of their computer 
exploding or so.
