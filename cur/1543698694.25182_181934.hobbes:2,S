This problem is not specifically related to the Logitech one. There are
several cases related to this bug (ie for instance
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/11/27/153
 )
Your | key should be the same as the "*" key on french keyboards.
I submitted a bug report dealing with the details of this problem, but
still no answer yet.
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1637
The patch provided by Tonnerre Anklin should work (I wouldn't have
changed the two values, just 84 -> 43) but it may break some other 
keyboards. This is one question asked in the bug report.
And the other is : why did it work with 2.4.x kernels ?
Thank you to Cc me for any answer ...
