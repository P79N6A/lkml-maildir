When I boot off the Fedora 10 full distribution DVD, which I believe is 
kernel 2.6.27.5, at the first screen, "Welcome to Fedora 10!", I tell it 
to Install or upgrade, and then I get a variety of errors on the text 
console, including:
    ata1.00 failed to IDENTIFY
and
    PNP: PS/2 appears to have AUX port disabled ...
and problems enumerating USB devices, and
    ehci_hcd 0000:00:04.1: Unlink after no_IRQ? Controller is probably 
using the wrong IRQ.
and
    ohci_hcd 0000:00:04.0: Unlink after no_IRQ? Controller is probably 
using the wrong IRQ.
after which it does nothing. There is no power to USB and PS/2 devices.
Let me know any other ways I can help you diagnose this.
