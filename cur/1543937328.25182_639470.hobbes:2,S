Thanks for your advice.
We got the same advice from Jonathan@LWN in Embedded Linux Conference 2007,
and contacted AppArmor folks but no action occurred. We'll try to contact again.
John Johansen:
Both AppArmor and TOMOYO need vfsmount in LSM hooks. Although we suggested
another solution in [TOMOYO #6], we can use AppArmor's approach.
How about submitting only vfsmount patches before submitting AppArmor/TOMOYO
main module?
We think the patches relate to not only LSM folks but also fsdevel folks.
So we are going to post the brief description of the patches to fsdevel.
