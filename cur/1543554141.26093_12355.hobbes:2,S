I won't say there are no issues, but I'd say there are
no KNOWN issues.

I know that, Constantine. But I know a few people at
work who used it (me included), and I also had a
report
from a guy in germany using it with success.
I know this is really not much, but we used to read
about problems by the past, and I haven't received
even one complaint about the new one, so I bet it's a
bit better than it was.

try
to take some time to make the megaraid work again on
my server).
