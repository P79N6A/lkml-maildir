"originally"?  These are new functions added to the PCI core.  I think
that any driver that wants to use this functionality had better be
released under the GPL as what they are wanting to do is a "new" thing.
That's why I prefer all new exports to be marked _GPL.

This has been discussed a lot already.  I think we might as well let the
thing fail in random and odd ways, as it's some pretty broken hardware
anyway that wants this functionality :)
