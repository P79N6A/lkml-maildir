I would suggest a default policy of "panic", and a way of overriding
the policy, probably with a boot command-line option.  The reality is
that most of the time, the failure case of a failed or partially
failed initramfs is not going to be well tested, as you have pointed
out, the downsidesof a booted-but-dysfunctional system is often going
to be worse than a hard failure.  The partially decoded case is going
to be even worse, so I can see a three-way policy:
   failed-initramfs-decode=panic      Panic on failed initramfs
   failed-initramfs-decode=partial    If the initramfs fails part-way in, 
   				      decode what you can and let the boot
				      system see what files could be fully
				      decypted
   failed-initramfs-decode=allow      If the initramfs decryption fails
   				      part-of-the-way in, continue the
				      boot, but do not provide the partial
				      initramfs --- i.e., this is the 
				      all-or-nothing option
If this is too complicated, I'd be happy with the "panic on failed
initramfs".  After all, the user can always simply delete the initrd
specifier from their grub boot configuration, and simply retry the
boot....
