in fact i've re-uploaded a new version of the -T6 patch to disable
direct interrupts under PREEMPT_REALTIME kernels. The only exception is
IRQ1 on PCs (the keyboard irq), which can be useful for debugging
purposes (SysRq, etc.). I turned the keyboard related locks into raw
spinlocks to make this safe.
