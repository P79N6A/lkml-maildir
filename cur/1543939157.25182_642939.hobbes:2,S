Hi,
The following series of patches is intended to fix the suspend/resume deadlock
occuring as a result of unregistering device objects, locked by the PM core,
during suspend/resume cycles by the b43 driver.
In short, the b43 driver is modified to avoid unregistering device objects
during suspend/resume cycles except for the resume code path, in which the
devices are unregistered using the recently introduced suspend-safe method.
For this purpose, it is necessary to introduce the possibility to safely remove
misc devices, leds classdevs and hwrng devices during suspend/resume cycles
(patches 2/5, 4/5, 3/5, respectively).
Please consider for applying.
Thanks,
Rafael
