This isn't debug code.  It's used to calculate the roughly number
picoseconds per cycle.  This is used in the driver to make sure
HyperTransport reads haven't timed out (see ipath_snap_cntr in
ipath_driver.c) when reading chip counters.  If you can think of a
better way of figuring out whether a read took greater than a certain
length of time, I'd be interested in knowing it.
Regards,
 Robert.
