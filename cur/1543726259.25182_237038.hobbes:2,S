The intrusiveness is somewhat mitigated by not having to convert all
architectures at once, though; the generic code would only be
included for those architectures that set the relevant CONFIG_.  At
that point, it basically is just moving code from one file to another
(for x86), and doing minor tweaks for those architectures that are
close to what x86 does.

Yes, but the IO-APIC code needs to be changed anyway to work properly
with IRQ threads.

It could be useful for SA_NOTHREAD interrupts, but I don't think it
buys much for threaded interrupts (as you'd have to wait until normal
IRQs are enabled to schedule the handler thread anyway).

I agree.  How much slower would it be (is it worth an #ifdef for irq
threads)?  Hopefully PIC operations aren't as slow as they are on the
8259...
