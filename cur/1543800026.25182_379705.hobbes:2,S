Ok, but keep in mind that these numbers are just "snapshots". With
almost all schedulers the priority of the CPU-eater transcode and other
processes fluctuate a bit (an exception here is nicksched, that gives
priority 40 to transcode and never change it).
It seems also that small variation of the priority can affect seriously
my DD test case running time (expecially, I think, with schedulers that
give to "transcode" a better-or-equal priority than "dd" -->
ingosched/staircaise).
This is another mail in witch you weren't in CC that explains it better:
