is home for my configified version of bigphysarea. I announced it on this
list.
As I noted in an unquoted portion of my post, bigphysarea is not the correct
solution for an ISA memory hole, though it is the third standard reply to
the FAQ. That's how I got interested in bigphysarea. In kernel/init.c, vm
initialization assumes that all memory is contiguous. This causes a hole mod
to bigphysarea to fail for the same reason that Aaron Grier noted using a
bios memory hole.

I think the remainder of my post suggested that I'm doing precisely that.
This problem has been around a lot longer than I have. Sorry if you took
offense.
