Subject: [PATCH 2/2] ppc64: Fix iseries_veth module unload race and memory leak
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi All,
When the iseries_veth driver module is unloaded there is the potential for an
oops and also some memory leakage.
Because the HvLpEvent_unregisterHandler() function did no synchronisation, it
was possible for the handler that was being unregistered to be running on another
CPU *after* HvLpEvent_unregisterHandler() had returned. This could cause the
iseries_veth driver to leave work in the events work queue after the module
had been unloaded. When that work was eventually executed we got an oops.
In addition some of the data structures in the iseries_veth driver were not
being correctly freed when the module was unloaded.
This is the second patch, we make iseries_veth call flush_scheduled_work()
after we are sure the handler is no longer running, and also fix the memory leaks.
