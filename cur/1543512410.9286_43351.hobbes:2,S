Right, I remember.  Others did too, however from all the info my
brain took in from multiple sources it appeared that 2.2.12 was
worse.  Perhaps that was not correct, but that is how I saw it so
I stayed with 11.  I had a very long uptime indeed!  This only
made me feel even safer with it...

Ok, if that is true, then I am definitely interested in 2.2.12
then.

Allright, I will roll a 2.2.12 kernel as soon as someone tells me
where to get the patch to fix it is.  Or should I get the latest
pre-13 patch?

Hmm..  I don't recall that, but if true, I will just uninstall it
and reinstall.  I need to upgrade to the latest version anyways.

Probably vmware.  I had trouble with that too a long while back.
Not any more though.  VMWARE has been pretty solid.  The only
complaints that I have are that it can't change resolution to
anything other than what X is using at the time.  This sucks
bigtime as a fullscreen application ends up in 640x480 centered
on the 1024.768 screen...  ;o(

Yep, I pointed this out allready too.

Actually, I understand that their parport driver is GPL, and is
just a modified version of the existing Linux parport driver.
As time goes on, all that can happen is that it gets better, more
stable, etc...
Take care, and thanks for the suggestions!  I'll be rolling a new
kernel as soon as I get the patch info!
