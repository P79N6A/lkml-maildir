Subject: [PATCH 2 of 2] IB/ipath - use memcpy_cachebypass in RDMA interrupt handler to reduce packet loss
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In cases where a large incoming RDMA is being received, we have to
copy data inside the interrupt handler before we can ACK each packet.
The source is DMAed to by the hardware, which means that the CPU won't
have it cached.  We only read the source this one time; using normal load
instructions pollutes the dcache with useless data, reducing performance
to the point where we can lose a significant number of packets.
We use memcpy_cachebypass to try to not fill the dcache with useless data.
Avoiding the cache refill penalty lets us keep up better with the sender,
resulting in many fewer dropped packets.
