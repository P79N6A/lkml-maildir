No, that is very different.  That option is present if you don't want to
build some firmware images from the source that is present in the kernel
tree, and instead, use the pre-built stuff that is also present in the
kernel tree.
It is there so that we do not require some additional tools that the
majority of kernel developers do not have installed on their machine in
order to create a working kernel image for some types of hardware.
Hope this helps,
