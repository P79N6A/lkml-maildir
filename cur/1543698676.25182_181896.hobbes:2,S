It has (for 2.0, 2.2, 2.4 ext2) - it just was never merged into baseline.
2.4:

2.2:

FWIW, I have a 2.2 server keeping >20 workstations' daily backups on
compressed ext2:
/dev/md2              441G  154G  287G  35% /backup-versioned
/dev/md4              144G  141G  3.5G  98% /backup-versioned2
and it's really solid.
