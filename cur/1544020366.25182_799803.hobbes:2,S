I rather suspect that the majority of private workqueues are there for
good reasons.

Actually it /should/ be the other way around:
The shared workqueue should only be used for work that sleeps only
briefly (perhaps with the exception of very unlikely longer sleeps e.g.
for allocations that cause paging).
Work which /may/ sleep longer, for example performs SCSI transactions,
needs to go into a private workqueue or other kind of context.
OTOH you are right too; work which must not be deferred too long by work
from another uncooperative/ unfair subsystem is probably also better off
in an own workqueue...
