many (most?) Lustre deployments are with SATA and md raid5 and GigE -
can't get much cheaper than that.
if you want storage node failover capabilities (which larger sites often
do) or want to saturate an IB link then the price of the storage goes
up but this is a consequence of wanting more reliability or performance,
not anything to do with lustre.
interestingly, one of the ways to provide dual-attached storage behind
a failover pair of lustre servers (apart from buying SAS) would be via
a networked-raid-1 device like Evgeniy's, so I don't see distributed
block devices and distributed filesystems as being mutually exclusive.
iSER (almost in 
http://stgt.berlios.de/
) is also intriguing.

quite likely.
from what I understand (hopefully I am mistaken) they consider a merge
task to be too daunting as the number of kernel subsystems that any
scalable distributed filesystem touches is necessarily large.
roadmaps indicate that parts of lustre are likely to move to userspace
(partly to ease solaris and ZFS ports) so perhaps those performance
critical parts that remain kernel space will be easier to merge.
cheers,
robin
