I don't really see how cmpxchg might be needed here.
Atomic fetch of a static variable is how I will do it in my next version for the
non optimized case :
volatile static var = 0;
if(var) {
  preempt disable
  call
  preempt_enable_no_resched
}
But, still, in the optimized case, the if(var) will depend on an immediate
value, therefore saving the memory read.

This is exactly why the preemption is disabled around the call. However, RCU
must always _see_ a coherent version of the structure in memory.
Calling an empty function, disabling preemption around the call and calling
synchronize_sched() before deleting the removed function looks very much like
a RCU-style protection (actually, that's what it is).
