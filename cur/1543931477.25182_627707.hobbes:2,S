Subject: [2.6 patch] Kconfig help: don't refer to the PCI-HOWTO
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/13/350

A HOWTO that hasn't been updated for half a dozen years no longer
"contains valuable information about which PCI hardware does work under 
Linux and which doesn't".
