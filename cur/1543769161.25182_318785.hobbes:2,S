For users, the OS is a black box, it provides services of FS.
The OS should hide differences of each FS, so usermode app can
run happily on every FS. For the same reason, OS should return
the same error, no matter what FS it comes from. Users only care
about the interface, not the implementation. So, OS should
_AT LEAST_ make the interface clear(here means the syscall should
return a definite error)
