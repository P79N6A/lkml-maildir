With the new code Linus already merged, signalfd does not attach to the 
sighand anymore, so the "orphaned sighand" behaviour is no more there.
An exec() will carry the fd over, and you will be able to use the fd in 
the same way you did before the exec(). If sigpending()/sigwaitinfo() will 
show signals available, so it should signalfd.

It'll return the signals that would be normally returned to the thread 
with the standard signal delivery methods. That is, calling thread private 
signals, and calling thread-group shared signals.
