This sounds like it's behind dependent on physically scanning slabs,
since one must choose slab pages for replacement on the basis of their
potential to restore contiguity, not merely "dump whatever's replaceable
and check how much got freed".

A larger question in my mind is what slabs have to do with this at all.
Slabs are for fixed-size allocations. These techniques are explicitly
oriented toward making user allocations more variable, not less.
