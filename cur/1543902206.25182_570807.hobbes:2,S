Ok, we should definitely try to just translate the things, and instead of 
having user apps that have to know about the (generally not very 
interesting) differences between IDE and SCSI command set, and when the 
IDE driver gets a SCSI request (whether from the new generic SG layer or 
obviously the older SCSI-ioctl layer) it should "just work".
So I object to that "dumb application" statement. It's the kernel that has 
traditionally been dumb in not smoothing over the differences between 
devices well enough.
We shouldn't _need_ to have applications care. They should be able to just 
use regular SCSI commands, and if the device cannot handle a 10-byte read 
command, the kernel should have translated that into a 6-byte one (for 
example) rather than the application having to know about idiotic small 
differences like that.
That said, I dunno how to fix this particular one, and the IDE driver is 
singularly unhelpful in actually talking about *what* the command tried to 
be.
