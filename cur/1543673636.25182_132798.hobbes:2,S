They are defined in Intel's IA32 manual set, volume 3,
"System Programming Guide", downloadable from developer.intel.com.
These errors mean that APIC bus messages are lost or have checksum errors.
You don't say which kernel you're using or which chipset, but chances are
your mobo's APIC bus is noisy.

You can try booting with "noapic", that should let you keep using SMP
while avoiding your possibly buggy APIC bus.
