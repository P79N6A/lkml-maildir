No it was right. I need that too in recover_lost_timer() when converting
from usec to jiffies the time passed between the last and the current
timer irq. The point is that the value in usec is a multiple of 10000, but
for some arithmetic error due conversion between timer-chip-latch to usec,
it could be 19999 or 20001, and if it will be 19999 recover_lost_timer()
could not notice that we missed a timer irq.
So the right thing to do also in recover_lost_timer is not only to divide
by 1000000/HZ as in my first preliminary patch, but to get a 100%
relialable value (and fooling the aritmethic errors) we must do:
	ticks_passed = (delta_usec + 500000/HZ) / (1000000/HZ);
This way I checked that recover_lost_timer() never risk to not notice
a losed an irq.
So here it is a new patch. Maybe it's better to not printk a NOTICE to the
user... Personally I would like to know when I lose timer irq and I don't
think it's something it has to happen in regular conditions even if I
think we need this patch because we _must_ be robust enough to deal with
lost timer irqs also considering that the code inserted is really minimal.
And maybe somebody needs really to do something with irq disabled for long
times.
I also fixed the CALIBRATE_TIME that was 50001 while it had to be 50000
(with my patch calibrate_time now is 50000 as my HP-48 agree with). Let me
know if I missed something.
So here it is my new timer-2.2.3-B:
