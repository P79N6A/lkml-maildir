I see... well I am finally getting it to boot, i did not have initrd
support built into the 2.4.32 kernel, but now i'm getting LVM errors:
Scanning logical volumes
   /bin/vgscan.lvm1: execvp failed: No such file or directory
ERROR: /bin/vgscan exited abnormally!
Activating logical volumes
   /bin/vgchange.lvm1: execvp failed: No such file or directory
ERROR: /bin/vgchange exited abnormally!
I know nothing about LVM so... i'm pretty clueless for now
