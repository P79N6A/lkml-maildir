I've not done rigorous benchmarking of this, no. Presumably
microbenchmarks that utilize the pte cache without thrashing it would
save themselves one page zeroing per pagetable page after the first
iteration unless there's a bug in the cache flushing logic.

This was a micro-optimization for UP; the SMP case needs to protect
against reentry via interrupts due to smp_call_function(). UP can
just disable preemption. In principle, the two cases could be made
uniform at the cost of disabling interrupts unnecessarily on UP.

There are some bootstrap ordering issues, but they're tractable. One
oddity is that in the highpte case, shrink_slab() will be skipped, but
the pagetable cache highmem-allocated. I'm not sure whether that's
important or not, but I erred on the side of caution.
Maybe I should slap a copyright down on arch/i386/mm/pgtable.c; I
appear to have written a substantial chunk of the code in there, too.
