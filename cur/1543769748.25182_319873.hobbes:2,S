	That would be too logical.  Here you go.  The first file is a
sample Makefile for both 2.6 and 2.4, stripped out of our history.  Any
mistakes are mine.  The second is Kbuild-24.make.  The files expect
KERNELDIR and KERNELINC to be set, and a 2.4 build needs to set GCCINC
as well.  Use your favorite autoconf/anti-autoconf system.
