This is killing my xserver compile, apm_event_t is used in the xserver 
source.  The commit that introduced the problem is:
commit ee8e7cfe9d330d6f1ce0b9b1620d6df5d9cf6b70

     Make asm-x86/bootparam.h includable from userspace.
     To actually write a bootloader (or, say, the lguest launcher)
     currently requires duplication of these structures.  Making them
     includable from userspace is much nicer.
     We merge the common userspace-required definitions of e820_32/64.h
     into e820.h for export.
