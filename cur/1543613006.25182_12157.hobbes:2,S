What???  You've just said that on the first stage you are not going to
free these objects and then add freeing them and audit the whole thing 
at that point.
The first is commonly known as leak (objects are allocated but not freed).
Dangling pointers is what you will have to fight during that audit -
places where something retains kdev_t after your object had been freed.
Let me rephrase it: with your plan we will have much more complex audit
needed at the moment when you introduce freeing your objects.  Reason:
it will have to involve all subsystems using kdev_t at once.  That's
my problem with your plan.  Sigh...
