Sorry, I can't parse this. Linux programs see filenames in the charset 
specified by the "iocharset" mount option or this default. If some filenames 
are in UTF-8 and some aren't, the "ls" command cannot show them all 
correctly on a properly configured (aka: correctly displays the output of 
"yes --help") terminal (because it assumes that all filenames are in the 
same charset as indicated by the output of "locale charmap"). IMHO, this is 
insane enough, and it makes sense  to disable this by default.

More details please. Are you saying that for Japanese people the codepage 
for FAT and SMB filesystems is not the same? How do Microsoft products work 
then? What do they send over the wire?

I did this because it involved less changes. Only FAT treats codepage as a 
number. All other filesystems already allow arbitrary NLS as a codepage 
mount parameter.

For any non-UTF-8 based locales, the other NLS is correct and utf8 indeed 
would produce completely wrong characters. But for UTF-8 based locales, utf8 
is the only correct iocharset.
And the downgraded warning is not for those who mis-use the utf8 iocharset 
in non-UTF-8 locales, they need a completely different wording: "your 
iocharset doesn't match the locale settings, non-ASCII characters will be 
completely wrong in filenames". Unfortunately, this condition is impossible 
to detect from within the kernel.

OK, now I see that your primary objection is to merging options, and 
disagree (incorrect locale setup on your side is suspected). For meaningful 
discussion, I want to see the following:
1) Output of "locale -a"
2) Output of "yes --help" from the same terminal
3) The correct iocharset and codepage for mounting FAT filesystems on USB 
flash drives that are known readable under Windows (here "correct" = "ls in 
this terminal shows filenames correctly").
4) The same for SMB filesystems.
