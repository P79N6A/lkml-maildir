And you assume doctor would care to compile the kernel himself in his
working hours, rather than ask the NOC staff of $hospital to do that for
him?  You expect Linux would ship with these binary drivers for any
device?  All major Linux distributions (including Turbo, Red Hat and
Fedora, Novell, SUSE and Opensuse, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo) could work
out a single way of installing drivers?  Interesting.

That coder needs to be provided with full specs, and that is what
usually does not happen, because then the hardware isn't as easily
exchangable to save 0.003 US$ per device, many vendors fear their
"intellectual property" (as though thoughts had property rights, brains
have...).
