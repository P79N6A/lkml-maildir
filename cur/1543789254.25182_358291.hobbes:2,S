Actually, one of my fastest machines is this one:
bruehe2# cat /proc/cpuinfo 
[...]
model name      : Pentium III (Katmai)
cpu MHz         : 551.280
[...]
And one, which has a not-so-good connection to me.

That's clear :-)

distcc will fail here, because of different gccs and different distributions
(ever tried to use gentoo and distcc in the same distcc-network? It's a real
pain).
Thanks for the hints anyway,
