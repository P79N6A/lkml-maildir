Doh.   I must compile that debugging in when I am testing.  I introduced a spin lock,
and then I called a function that might sleep...  Though I am puzzled by what
in the device_shutdown and reboot notifier path is actually sleeping
but that is academic.
Next version will use a semaphore to be polite.
I should have asked where those addresses mapped to in your
system.map.
Anyway one of the reasons I grumble about splitting it, more global
variables that have to be protected, and more chances to fumble
something.  Oh, well.

I don't think there is anything significant.

I am not certain.  All that is certain is there is an unhandled
interrupt.  
Anyway the next step will be to enter the Linux kernel in 32bit mode
so I can avoid the whole mess of getting the BIOS working again.  That
should avoid most of these complications as I will be able to skip
the whole step of enabling interrupts.
