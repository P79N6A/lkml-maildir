We can agree to disagree about how "experimental" mainline should
be. The bottom line is that the patch that broke your boot was the
"obviously correct" thing to do, and even if mainline was "rock
stable", whatever that means, we still would've put it in because it
fixed boot on a different set of machines... Basically we have to
query the BIOS for Calgary register window and bus setup informationn,
what we had before was a brittle hack (replicate what the BIOS did to
get the same values) that eventually broke when the BIOS - surprise,
surprise - did something differently. Of course that doesn't mean the
bug you ran into shouldn't have been caught earlier.

You got that right :-) but still, I should've caught the potential
infinite loop with bad BIOS inputs when reviewing the patch. For that
I do apologize.

No argument about this.

Agreed.
