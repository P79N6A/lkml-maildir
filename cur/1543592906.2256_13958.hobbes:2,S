Strictly speaking, not actually a bug. DoC_Probe() itself is only ever 
called from __init code. But it's probably not worth trying to make the 
checker notice that situation - I've fixed it anyway by making DoC_Probe() 
__init too, which saves a bit more memory. Thanks.
parse_mem_cmdline() in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c is a similar false (or at
least questionable) positive. Note that it's an inline function, only used
inside setup_arch(), which _is_ marked __init.
