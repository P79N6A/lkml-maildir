I agree.  When you can spend a little extra time and get something working.
I find it nice.  If it doesn't work out oh, well.

Hmm.  Bootloaders have had lots of restrictions on getting up high.  
Plus in some real sense it make sense to pack the two as close
together as possible.  For 2.5.x and Al Viro's initfs work I'd like
to do that.
If you load your ramdisk at the same location every time, after
a point you have fewer surprises, and potentially a simpler bootloader.

8MB is the safe limit.  The only worry some case right now is the
bootmem allocator with a darn huge bitmap.  It is allocated
dynamically, and it is extremely hard to predict where that will be
except in the initial page tables 8MB in size.  If the ugly bitmap
is allocated elsewhere the kernel can't use it.
On low memory configurations you have no choice.  But it will probably
work.  Getting better requires more work in setup.c than is likely to
go into 2.4.x.
On old kernels the big worry is the allocation of the struct page
array.  I have observed this array exceed 64MB in memory.  High enough
so that some older bootloaders can't load initrd high enough to cope.
I believe int 0x15 function ah=87 can't move blocks above that.
Either going high or going low with ramdisk placement requires
knowledge of how the kernel allocates it's memory.  And people don't
often reference bootloader docs when they change the policy so it is
fragile to depend upon how the kernel does it's allocations.
So if we are going to fix the fragility please let's handle both ends.
Then it will be o.k. to put the ramdisk where ever the kernel says
it is safe.  And we can stop this guessing and breaking game.
