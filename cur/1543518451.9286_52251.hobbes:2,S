[note that all i really wanted was to point out one of the consequences
 of introducing syscalls with six args, which 2.1.31pre1 did. The
 SYSENTER stuff is not as simple as it looks at first; i intended, and
 will, post the code, but i want to take care if all the issues i
 already know about first (otherwise it's fully functional, i can eg
 run benchmarks, compile kernels etc already). I'll try doing that
 ~ the weekend.]

Yep. and all the cases i've so far identified are handled (although
i'm assuming ds is std on entry for non-vm86 tasks (note the ss case
you don't even get to check)).

exactly.
[there is something you could do -- not make SYSENTER available from vm86,
 ie clear the msr while switching to a vm86 task, and reset it otherwise.
 I don't like the cost though, as it likely means two additional conditional
 branches and an extra msr write in switchto()]
[if fact what i'm doing right now is trying to put as many cases as possible
 back on the sysexit path -- it _will_ make it a few cycles slower, but
 there are other reasons i need the extra code for anyway]

ok, that's simple enough. But do we really want linux syscalls executed
from inside wine, dosemu etc?
[i'll ignore vmware for now, but there might be some interesting
 possibilities there... :^) ]

As i said, finding out is on my todo list. [iirc it's not fatal, but i
did not investigate this fully, it could make a difference, and even
if it does, should be easy to fix]
