I have the problem without leaving it a few hours, but when I do it gets
definitely worse. Last vmstat output I quoted here showed around 256MB
swapped. A few hours later - the computer had been sitting idle, only
the mail server for three users was running which poses no overhead at
all -, the entire 512MB SWAP space was used. Why, I don't know.
I'm about to try 2.4.20-jam0, -aa derived. I'll post results from that
kernel later.
