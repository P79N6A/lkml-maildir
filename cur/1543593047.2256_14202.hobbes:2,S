I don't know what the bottleneck is. What I'm seeing is ~60Mbps transmit 
speed and anywhere from 1 to 12Mpbs receive speed on a couple 10/100 cards 
using the 2.2.16, 2.2.19 and 2.4.3 kernels.
I have tried increasing the size of the RX ring buffer and it did not seem 
to make any difference. It appears that there is some sort of overrun or 
other problem. There is a significant slowdown between the 2.2.x and 2.4.x 
kernels.
However, just tonight, while really hammering on the system, I started to 
get some messages like "eth1: Oversized Ethernet frame spanned multiple 
buffers, status 7fff8301!". Any ideas what could be causing that?
