two things I see
1. why should different, unrelated busses need to wait for each other? 
picking two, why can't you have SCSI and USB going through their timeouts 
at the same time?
2. I'm not sure that you can always do the device enumeration before you 
do the slow probing, there's another message in this thread that talks 
about a USB device where you need to load firmware to it before you can 
find out what is really there. in a case like this devices would either 
show up in a random order during step #2, or they should not be added to 
the system until step #3, which makes step #3 more then just waiting for 
the async portions to finish.
