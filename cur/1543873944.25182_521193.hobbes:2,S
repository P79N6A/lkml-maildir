Begorrah - patches from Irish people on Paddy's day, who would have though it.
Clearly, this patch is full of lucky charms.
On a more serious note, this patch appears to address the page allocation
problem reported by Mariusz Kozlowski.
Changelog since v1
o Select the number of blocks to mark MIGRATE_RESERVE intelligently
o Take bootmem into account when placing MIGRATE_RESERVE blocks
The standard buddy allocator always favours the smallest block of pages. The
effect of this is that the pages free to satisfy min_free_kbytes tends to be
preserved since boot time at the same location of memory ffor a very long time
and as a contiguous block. When an administrator sets the reserve at 16384 at
boot time, it tends to be the same MAX_ORDER blocks that remain free. This
allows the occasional high atomic allocation to succeed up until the point
the blocks are split. In practice, it is difficult to split these blocks
but when they do split, the benefit of having min_free_kbytes for contiguous
blocks disappears. Additionally, increasing min_free_kbytes once the system
has been running for some time has no guarantee of creating contiguous blocks.
On the other hand, CONFIG_PAGE_GROUP_BY_MOBILITY favours splitting large blocks
when there are no free pages of the appropriate type available. A side-effect
of this is that all blocks in memory tends to be used up and the contiguous
free blocks from boot time are not preserved like in the vanilla allocator.
This can cause a problem if a new caller is unwilling to reclaim or does
not reclaim for long enough.
A failure scenario was found for a wireless network device allocating order-1
atomic allocations but the allocations were not intense or frequent enough
for a whole block of pages to be preserved for MIGRATE_HIGHALLOC. This was
reproduced on a desktop by booting with mem=256mb, forcing the driver to
allocate at order-1, running a bittorrent client (downloading a debian ISO)
and building a kernel with -j2.
This patch addresses the problem on the desktop machine booted with mem=256mb.
It works by setting aside a reserve of MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES blocks, the number
of which depends on the value of min_free_kbytes.  These blocks are only
fallen back to when there is no other free pages. Then the smallest possible
page is used just like the normal buddy allocator instead of the largest
possible page to preserve contiguous pages The pages in free lists in the
reserve blocks are never taken for another migrate type.  The results is
that even if min_free_kbytes is set to a low value, contiguous blocks will
be preserved in the MIGRATE_RESERVE blocks.
This works better than the vanilla allocator because if min_free_kbytes
is increased, a new reserve block will be chosen based on the location of
reclaimable pages and the block will free up as contiguous pages. In the
vanilla allocator, no effort is made to target a block of pages to free as
contiguous pages and min_free_kbytes pages are scattered randomly.
This effect has been observed on the test machine. min_free_kbytes
was set initially low but it was kept as a contiguous free block within
MIGRATE_RESERVE. min_free_kbytes was then set to a higher value and over a
period of time, the free blocks were within the reserve and coalescing. How
long it takes to free up depends on how quickly LRU is rotating. Amusingly,
this means that more activity will free the blocks faster.
This mechanism potentially replaces MIGRATE_HIGHALLOC as it may be more
effective than grouping contiguous free pages together. It all depends on
whether the number of active atomic high allocations exceeds min_free_kbytes or
not. If the number of active allocations exceeds min_free_kbytes, it's worth
it but maybe in that situation, min_free_kbytes should be set higher. Once
there are no more reports of allocation failures, a patch will be submitted
that backs out MIGRATE_HIGHALLOC and see if the reports stay missing.
Credit to Mariusz Kozlowski for discovering the problem, describing the
failure scenario and testing patches and scenarios.
