This is just your guess at present, isn't it, Andrea?  Any evidence?
Our current intention is to merge anonmm into mainline in a day or two.
The current consensus (in your absence!) seemed to be that anonmm is
likely to be good enough, no obvious need to go beyond it.
We'll happily replace it with anon_vma once we see the practical
problems which anon_vma solves and anonmm cannot, so long as the
greater cost of anon_vma (in complexity, memory usage, and vma
merge limitations) is worth it.  Can happen just days later,
but would need evidence.
