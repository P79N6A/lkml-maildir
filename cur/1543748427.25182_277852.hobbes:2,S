This is a question I try to find an answer. If the community agrees
the /proc is the right place for it, I would be very happy to move it
to /proc and implement it with procfs.

SGI is providing job to our customers as a kernel module. 
But adding /proc/<pid>/job needs to patch fs/proc/base.c, we can not
do that in a module. Of course if job gets accepted, this won't be a problem.

We want to keep the same userland libraries and commands we have been
providing to our customers. Here is the library interface.
jid_t
job_create( jid_t jid_requested, uid_t uid, int options );
jid_t
job_getjid( pid_t pid );
jid_t
job_waitjid( jid_t jid, int *status, int options );
int
job_killjid( jid_t jid, int sig );
int
job_getjidcnt( void );
int
job_getjidlist( jid_t *jid, int bufsize );	/* buffer size in bytes*/
int
job_getpidcnt( jid_t jid );
int
job_getpidlist( jid_t jid, pid_t *pid, int bufsize ); /* buffer size in bytes*/
uid_t
job_getuid( jid_t jid );
pid_t
job_getprimepid( jid_t jid );
int
job_sethid( unsigned int hid );
int
job_detachjid( jid_t jid );
jid_t
job_detachpid( pid_t pid );
We will need more than those two entries in /proc as you listed above.
Would it be considered abusing /proc to have too much job stuff there?
Thanks,
