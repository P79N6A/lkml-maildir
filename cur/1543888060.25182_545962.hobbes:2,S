Pardon, I was GE's representative to the original X3J11 committee, and 
'volatile' was added to "codify existing practice" which is one of the 
goals of a standard. The extension existed, in at least two forms, to 
allow handling of memory mapped hardware. So the committee did not take 
it upon itself, it was a part of the defined duty of the committee.
The intents was simple, clear, and limited, to tell the compiler that 
every read of a variable in source code should result in a read, at that 
point in the logic, and similar for writes. In other words, the code 
should not be moved and should generate a real memory access every time. 
People have tried to do many things with that limited concept since, 
some with "clarification" and some with assuming the compiler knows when 
to ignore volatile.
As someone noted about a committee, a committee is a poor way to get 
innovation, and a good way to have a bunch of know legible people shoot 
down bad ideas.
It was a fun experience, where I first learned the modern equivalent of 
Occam's Razor, Plauger's "Law of least astonishment," which compiler 
writers regularly violate :-(
