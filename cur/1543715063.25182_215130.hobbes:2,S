This is not safe, the BUG_ON is there for a reason. If the request in on
the merge hash when handed to the driver, you risk corrupting data. The
fix would be figuring out why this is happening. Maybe it's looking at
bad data, could you test with this patch applied and see if the oops
still triggers?
