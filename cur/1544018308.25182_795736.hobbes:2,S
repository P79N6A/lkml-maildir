Thanks for the clear explanation. Cpuset does it by reducing the badness to 
1/8th for tasks. So using oom-controller could kill some innocent processes on 
some other cpuset! 
But it is possible to have the same effect with oom_adj, having oom_adj=4 for 
a task on a diff cpuset will do the same(assuming they have similar badness).
I think cpusets preference could be improved, not to depend on badness, with 
something similar to what memcg does. With or without adding overhead of 
tracking processes that has memory from a node.
Thanks
