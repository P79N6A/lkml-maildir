I'm puzzled why you upgraded from one end-of-life'd distro to
another ancient end-of-life'd distro.   You're more likely to get
interest from the upstream developers if you're running
something recent.  Even _I_ don't remember what was good/bad
in the Fedora kernels from that era, and I built them :-)
