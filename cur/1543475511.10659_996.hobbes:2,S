Woops in both arca-vm-8 and arca-vm-9 there was a very stupid bug in my
changes of the memory_trashing heuristic (done at too late time..). 
Basically when a process was masked to be a memory_trasher, it had no ways
to return a not marked process................ 
I didn' t noticed the bug because I use swap only when I do my benchmarks
(when there is not swapping in progress the slowdown due some
shrink_mmap() can't be seen with eyes...) and when I run my benchmarks I
always start before the memory trasher proggy...
Thanks to Benjamin who showed me the bugs some seconds ago ;)
I've put out a new arca-vm-10 with at least this bug fixed.
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/kernel-patches/2.2.0-pre4-arca-VM-10
Excuse me...
BTW, I have reports that arca-vm-6/7 are faster than arca-vm-8/9
(arca-vm-7 is reported the fastest even more than arca-vm-3). Maybe it's
been due this bug that the latest are slower, or maybe the whole new
changes at the first memory_trashing code (the one in 2.2.0-pre4) are
hurting... (even if here them seems to helps, with them the trashing
process remains marked all the time and not only during low mem peak; and
not trashing process never get marked as trashing) 
And again thanks to Steve, Zlatko, Benjamin, Ben, Garst, MikeG, Kalle,
Brent and all other testers for their good reports!
