The combinations of kernel versions and filesystem types are:
2.4.20-8 ext2
2.4.20-19.9 ext2, ext3
2.4.20-24.9 ext2
2.4.20-28.9 ext2
I do the test with mozilla-1.3.tar.gz and 6 processes in the script,
it happens with ext2 within a few hours.
I haven't seen the problem on 2.4.20,23 and 24.
So now I am testing followings:
2.4.24-pre2 ext2 (mozilla-1.3.tar.gz)
2.4.24 ext2 (nvi-1.79.tar.gz)
2.4.20 ext3 (mozilla-1.3.tar.gz)
2.4.23 ext3 (mozilla-1.3.tar.gz)
2.4.24 ext3 (mozilla-1.3.tar.gz)
2.4.20-28.9 ext3 (mozilla-1.3.tar.gz)
Other than 2.4.20-28.9, since they have been running for three days,
they seems nice at this point.
What exactly is the race condition between read_inode() and
clear_inode() you have
mentioned?
Thanks,
Yoshi
