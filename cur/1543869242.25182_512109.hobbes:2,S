Yes, yes, yes.
As one of the poor suckers who has been fixing bugs in fs/aio.c and  
fs/direct-io.c, I really want everyone to read Ingo's paragraph a few  
times.  Have it printed on a t-shirt.
Look at the number of man-years that have gone into fs/aio.c and fs/ 
direct-io.c.  After all that effort it *barely* supports non-blocking  
O_DIRECT IO.
The maintenance overhead of those two files, above all else, is what  
pushed me to finally try that nutty fibril attempt.

Amen.
As an experiment, I'm working on backing the sys_io_*() calls with  
syslets.  It's looking very promising so far.
