Hi there,
I've never heard of pwrite and pread before, but htdig apparently makes
very heavy use of it.  On my 2.4.17 SMP 2GB HIGHMEM + ext3 system,
running htdig destroys input rates for every other process.  htdig's
output proceeds at approximately 2MB/s, but input for the entire system
runs only at about 4KB/s (YES, KB!).  If I suspend htdig, system block
input increases to the normal rate of 10-50MB/s.  Output still works, as
a dd from /dev/zero to a 400MB file runs at about 25MB/s.
Is linux's pwrite() just horribly broken?  Is htdig the only program 
that uses it?
Here's a little snapshot of htdig's syscalls, strace -s 0:
pwrite(6, ""..., 8192, 20717568)        = 8192
pread(6, ""..., 8192, 138395648)        = 8192
pwrite(6, ""..., 8192, 127918080)       = 8192
pread(6, ""..., 8192, 179281920)        = 8192
pwrite(6, ""..., 8192, 79732736)        = 8192
pread(6, ""..., 8192, 137633792)        = 8192
pwrite(6, ""..., 8192, 28409856)        = 8192
pread(6, ""..., 8192, 157958144)        = 8192
pwrite(6, ""..., 8192, 96583680)        = 8192
pread(6, ""..., 8192, 141254656)        = 8192
pwrite(6, ""..., 8192, 131031040)       = 8192
pread(6, ""..., 8192, 19095552)         = 8192
pwrite(6, ""..., 8192, 82698240)        = 8192
pread(6, ""..., 8192, 170573824)        = 8192
pwrite(6, ""..., 8192, 152616960)       = 8192
pread(6, ""..., 8192, 207298560)        = 8192
pwrite(6, ""..., 8192, 148635648)       = 8192
pread(6, ""..., 8192, 202768384)        = 8192
pwrite(6, ""..., 8192, 174055424)       = 8192
It's seeking all over the place.  Maybe pwrite/pread bypass the elevator
and proper I/O scheduling.
