libata is being paranoid about ATAPI devices,
and as of 2.6.14* it refuses to manage them unless you
supply the atapi_enabled=1 parameter to the kernel.
For built-in libata, use "libata.atapi_enabled=1" in your /boot/grub/menu.lst,
and for libata as a loadable module, put "options libata atapi_enabled=1"
into your /etc/modprobe.conf file (or whatever the nom de jour is for that).
Cheers
