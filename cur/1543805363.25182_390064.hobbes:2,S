As an non expert who just wants his boxes to work out of the box, I
feel that the above message best represents the issue at end.
Joerg seems to be concerned by 2 things:
- the portability of his application accross various platforms
- provide an end-to-end application for writing CDs from both the
command line and to various 3rd party front ends.
Providing a cross platform way to reference the devices seems to help
him achieve that goal.
Linux developers seem to see the world in a different way. Their main
requirements:
- compliance with the linux way of doing things
- ultimately a front end should hide all the dirty details. That
doesn't mean a command line version has to hide them as well, nor that
cdrecord should be the interface to ask things the operating system
can provide
So it looks like:
- from a cdrecord point ov view, Linux is broken.
- from a Linux developers point of view, cdrecord is doing too much
and forces things up.
<very naively>
As a developper with absolutely no competence in this area, I wonder
something: I don't see why the way to refer to a device affects the
ability to perform the functionality (write to it).
Isn't it possible to reorganize the code in such a way that the
burning part can be independent of the way the devices are referred
to?
I downloaded the code and quickly looked at it. If I am looking at the
right version, it seems that the cdrecord code that relates to both cd
burning + the Linux specific part is not that big (and very readable,
thanks Joerg). So I really don't understand why this issue doesn't get
fixed.
</very naively>
As with the communication problems between Joerg and the Linux
developers, if someone was stepping up to be the bridge betweem the 2
parties, couldn't that minimize the risk of flame wars?
cdrecord, how important is Linux to you?
Linux, how important is cdrecord to you?
If you 2 can't get along, just divorce! It's 2006 after all. And the
code is open.
Otherwise, talk together or use a counsellor and make this relationship work.
