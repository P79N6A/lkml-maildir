 Hi,
 Im running Redhat 6.2 i386 and Ive recently upgraded to the 2.2.17 kernel.
The reason for the kernel upgrade was that the select() call in one of the
programs I wrote, crashes periodically (once a day in the evening). I was
wondering if anyone has heard of anything like that, and if so, will it be
fixed? I just basically want to know what you guys know, if you know
anything about
a select() call crash.
