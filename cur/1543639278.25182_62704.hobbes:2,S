Just to forestall other private responses [already gotten two], mine is 
slightly different than your's, and David Woodhouse's setup.  My goal 
was basically to create a daily pre-patch, complete with hacked 
EXTRAVERSION.  That's something that is familiar to testers (pre-patch 
form), and the snapshot is not so often that people will get buried in a 
flurry of patches and csets. can you say "2.5.30-bk439" ;-)
So I consider my dailies as a complement to your bk2patch and dwmw2's 
output, not redundant.  Programmers would probably find dwmw2's per-cset 
patches to be more useful, while testers and power users, and maybe 
maintainers, would prefer daily pre-patches to test and sync against.
