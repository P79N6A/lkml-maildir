Wouldn't this cause, single IO to split into (possibly) 3 I/Os for 
RAW VARY on all unaligned IOs ? In that case, wouldn't it be better
of doing entire I/O with 512byte buffer heads, so that all of them 
can be merged ?
IMHO, preventing the merge due to b_size mismatch just to handle few
drivers/hardware may be overkill. This will penalize all the drivers
which can handle variable size IOs also. Isn't it ? Leaving it to
the driver and doing variable size I/O on only the drivers that can 
handle them, may be a better option ?
In my initial version of RAW VARY patch, I split the I/Os into possibly
3 I/O in raw.c. Do brw_kiovec(.., 512) for the first page and last pages &
4K for the middle pages. It showed reduction in CPU utilization for
large IOs. But it since it could split single I/O into 3 I/Os, i did
not see significant I/O throughput improvement.
