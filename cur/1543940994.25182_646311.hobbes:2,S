I can not speak to other archs, but for x86 I called trap_init from the 
code that caught the kgdbwait.  At that time (since I retired, I have 
not looked at the actual kernel code) it could be called again later by 
the kernel code.  I.e. I did not try to reorder the kernel bring up 
code, but just added an additional call to trap_init and then only in 
the case of finding a kgdbwait.
As such, this would need to be arch specific...

Likely.  Once you get it in the main line kernel, one would hope that 
other arch code would be forth coming as many more "eyes" will be in play.

Sure, sorry I picked the wrong reply button, never intended it to be 
private.
