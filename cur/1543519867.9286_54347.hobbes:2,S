Yes you did. Linux is hacker environment. Why do people hack? Because it
is a art form. Its your creation. Thats why I program. Linux is like
heaven to a true hacker. Thats why I moved from M$ windows to Linux. You
can create whatever you like with unlimited freedom. Take that away and
force people to use a properitary API then you take away the magic. If you
don't understand that well not everyone appreciates art. So please support
programming freedom.
