When page is free , page_count(page) == 0. But this just means page is 'free'.
To show page is a head of buddy (contiguous pages of 2^order pages), order is
stored into page->private. To show page->private has a valid 'order', PG_private
is used.
See page_is_buddy() function.

I think removing PG_private before freeing is sane.
The page is free, so it's needless to use PG_private bit when free_pages() is called.
