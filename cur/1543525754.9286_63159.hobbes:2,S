Ok, these kernel produce random segfaults on some SMP computers. Could
you describe the problem: does netscape always crash, or only sometimes?
It seems that there is a sector read problem: sometimes the sectors are
read correctly, and the program loads, sometimes a wrong sector is read,
and then netscape/vi always crashes until you reboot.
