Check the following things:
* Cooling - is the CPU fan, especially, working, and not clogged up with dust
* Memory - try booting Linux with MEM=16M or something - if the problem goes away, it's probably related to memory.  Try removing and re-inserting the RAM, and cleaning the edge connectors, (I had a machine run fine for a couple of years, then suddenly keep failing.  Cleaning the RAM edge connectors fixed it).
* PSU - make sure your power supply is suitable for the new CPU, (rule of thumb being 300+ Watt rating on it).
