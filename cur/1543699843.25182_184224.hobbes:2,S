ide-scsi does
        spin_lock_irqsave(&ide_lock, flags);
        while (HWGROUP(drive)->handler) {
                HWGROUP(drive)->handler = NULL;
                schedule_timeout(1);
        }
which is obvious crap. Scheduling while holding a spinlock is not a good
idea.
You could try dropping the lock over the schedule and re-aquire it
afterwards, but the comment tries to say that it is required for avoiding
new requests.
This is why ide-scsi needs a maintainer, btw - somebody who cares about
it, and actually tries to resolve the current mess.
