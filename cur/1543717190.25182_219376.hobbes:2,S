Do a grep for nforce and you'll find:
<B.Zolnierkiewicz@elka.pw.edu.pl>
	[PATCH] fixup for C1 Halt Disconnect problem on nForce2 chipsets
	Based on information provided by "Allen Martin" <AMartin@nvidia.com>:
	A hang is caused when the CPU generates a very fast CONNECT/HALT cycle
	sequence.  Workaround is to set the SYSTEM_IDLE_TIMEOUT to 80 ns.
	This allows the state-machine and timer to return to a proper state within
	80 ns of the CONNECT and probe appearing together.  Since the CPU will not
	issue another HALT within 80 ns of the initial HALT, the failure condition
	is avoided.
and:
<len.brown@intel.com>
	[ACPI] workaround for nForce2 BIOS bug: XT-PIC timer in IOAPIC mode 
	"acpi_skip_timer_override" boot parameter
	dmi_scan for common platforms, may be replaced with PCI-ID in future.

So it's only missing the patches that ross mentioned, it will still work
without em. (except for clock drift afair)
