Linus, please pull the latest scheduler git tree from:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched.git
these are all low-risk sched.o and task_struct debloating patches:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  37033    3066      20   40119    9cb7 sched.o.debug.before
  34840    3066      20   37926    9426 sched.o.debug.after
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  28997    2726      16   31739    7bfb sched.o.before
  27991    2726      16   30733    780d sched.o.after
1006 bytes of code off in the nondebug case (this also speeds things up) 
and 2193 bytes of code off in the debug case. The size of sched.o is now 
1k smaller than it was before CFS on SMP, and within 1k of its old size 
on UP. (Further reduction is possible, there is another patch that 
shaves off another 500 bytes but it needs some more testing.)
also a nice smpnice cleanup/simplification from Peter Williams.
built and booted on x86-32 and x86-64, built allnoconfig and 
allyesconfig, and for good measure it also passed 38 iterations of 'make 
randconfig; make -j vmlinux' builds without any failure.
Thanks!
	Ingo
