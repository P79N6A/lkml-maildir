Ok, I see your point. aops. Sorry.
Looking at the code this could be done. The wrappers that dispatch the
operations are really small and call the plugin that is registered with
the inode of the mapping. Instead it could have directly set the
corresponding operations. Right. The wrappers are doing a few things
before calling the plugin. That could be done the other way round too.
But that's more of an implementation issue and could still be changed.

I'm partly familiar with that, I just either misunderstood you or wasn't
really thinking (probably the latter...).
