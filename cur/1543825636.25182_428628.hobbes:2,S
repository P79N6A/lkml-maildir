This is actually over my head, but would it be possible to dynamically
switch between two drivers by saving and restoring whole context, much
like in suspend-resume process?
Lowest layer of fbdev/DRM would control basic PCI/memory management
and load/unload appropriate (module) driver, so we could safely switch
between different hardware management (driver) policies. Or I'm just
to fancy?
