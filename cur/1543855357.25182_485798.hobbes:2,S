It changes the sympthoms:
  CC      arch/mips/kernel/asm-offsets.s
In file included from include/linux/irqflags.h:14,
                 from include/asm/bitops.h:34,
                 from include/linux/bitops.h:9,
                 from include/linux/thread_info.h:20,
                 from include/linux/preempt.h:9,
                 from include/linux/spinlock.h:49,
                 from include/linux/capability.h:45,
                 from include/linux/sched.h:46,
                 from arch/mips/kernel/asm-offsets.c:13:
include/linux/kernel.h: In function ‘roundup_pow_of_two’:
include/linux/kernel.h:169: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘fls_long’
In file included from include/linux/thread_info.h:20,
                 from include/linux/preempt.h:9,
                 from include/linux/spinlock.h:49,
                 from include/linux/capability.h:45,
                 from include/linux/sched.h:46,
                 from arch/mips/kernel/asm-offsets.c:13:
include/linux/bitops.h: At top level:
include/linux/bitops.h:57: error: conflicting types for ‘fls_long’
include/linux/kernel.h:169: error: previous implicit declaration of ‘fls_long’ was here
So the new problem is circular includes:
   ... <linux/bitops.h> -> <asm/bitops.h> -> <linux/irqflags.h> ->
  <linux/kernel.h> -> <linux/bitops.h> ...
include/asm-mips/bitops.h needs to include irqflags because some older
MIPS variants do not have any atomic instructions.  So the fix needs to
to break that loop.
