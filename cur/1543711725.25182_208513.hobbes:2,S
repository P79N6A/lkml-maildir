[was "Poor DBT-3 pgsql 8way numbers on recent 2.6 mm kernels" on
linux-mm]
Andrew,
This same patch (02) applied in STP (plm 2780) when run against
dbt3-pgsql DSS workload displays the performance problem with the
throughput numbers that I reported on linux-mm on our 8way systems,
where the previous patch (plm 2777 -01) does not.  
Here is the data (patches applied to 2.6.5-rc1)
PLM.....CPUs.Runid..Thruput Metric (bigger is better)
2777(01)  8  290298  138.22  (base  )
2779(02)  8  290304  88.57   (-35.9%)
The 8way is a 700MHz (1024k processor cache) with 8GB of memory.
Original message on linux-mm:

For sar results see "Raw data" section everything labeled as
