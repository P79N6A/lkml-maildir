You cannot ever use any 'C' runtime library functions in your
modules. This means you cannot use open(), close(), read(),
write(), lseek(), etc. However, the kernel has some of its
own POSIX-compliant functions like memset(), memcpy(), strcpy(),
etc. You can look in ../linux-nn.nn/lib or look through the
headers to see what's available. There are semaphones and
other locking mechanisms available for use in the kernel
which, I recall, was your first inquiry.
Cheers,
