Hallo List,
The BK tree of today changed the data returned in /proc/stat.
A 'vmstat -n 10' immediatly segfaults after reading ...
open("/proc/stat", O_RDONLY)            = 6
read(6, "cpu  404408 506514 8240 154301 1"..., 4095) = 714
close(6)                                = 0
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---
+++ killed by SIGSEGV +++
I'll try to prove a diff between 2.4.18 and BK current later
this evening ...
cheers,
Patrick
