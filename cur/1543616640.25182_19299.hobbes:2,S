I agree that comments should not try to explain C to the
reader.  Comments should provide additional information,
such as telling the reader what the code is supposed to
do (as opposed to what it actually does, which may or may
not be the same thing).
In the line
    static int suspends_pending; /* = 0 */
the comment is not there to tell the reader that the variable
is initialized to zero.  It is there to tell the reader that
the variable _needs to be_ initialized to zero in order for
the code to work properly.  This is useful information,
because if someone later wants to modify the code to make
this variable non-static, the comment tells that person that
the variable will need an initializer.
