Report it as an error to the most appropriate forum.  Then it becomes
a hunt for why the symbol is undefined.
Sorry, afaics it's not possible to do this any better.
To illustrate the severity of the problem better, the following
program:
        .globl  _start
_start:
        add     r0, r0, #UNDEFINED_SYMBOL
        mov     pc, lr
will successfully assemble and link on ARM, and is in fact runnable
despite having a symbol table of the following:
$ arm-linux-nm t
00008074 t $a
0001007c A __bss_end__
0001007c A _bss_end__
0001007c A __bss_start
0001007c A __bss_start__
0001007c D __data_start
0001007c A _edata
0001007c A _end
0001007c A __end__
00008074 T _start
         U UNDEFINED_SYMBOL
