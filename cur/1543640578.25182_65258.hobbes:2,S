yes, this is called the 'array switch'. [the unit switched is not a queue,
but an array of queues.]

the queue arrays themselves are indexed by priority.

the new scheduler is not 100% equivalent to the old one - but the concepts
are pretty close. The changes that were done are:  different [better]
cache affinity logic, different [better] interactivity detection, better
yield() implementation, different timeslice lengths.

an RT task needs to be scheduled before any other task.
in the new scheduler RT tasks are in essence just tasks with higher
priority.
