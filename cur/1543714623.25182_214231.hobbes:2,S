Systems with >2T of physical memory are (as yet) unsupported on
ppc64.  The same limitation applies to normal pages.
Yes, that limit will need to be increased in the near future, and when
it does we will need to change this layout (as well as the overall
structure of the page tables, which is where the limit comes from for
normal pages).  We can get one extra bit trivially, since bit 1 is as
yet unused.  Beyond that we will probably have to make use of the fact
that there are 8 PMD slots for each huge page, and split the PFN
across those slots.  That still won't let us use the same format as
normal PTE entries, because we'll need the huge bit set in each PMD
entry.
