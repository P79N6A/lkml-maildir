Sorry for missing some cc's earlier. I blindly did a reply-all to the
mm-commits mail I got.

Yes. That's true. I will have to take the blame for that. It has been
known for a while during cpuidle development. But, it was never
documented as deprecating.

All kernel part is already merged. I mean, there are do drivers that
depend on max_cstate. They use latency_notifier thing today and their
migration to pm_qos part is not merged yet.

Exporting it as read only should be OK. We also need to know if there
are hard user space dependency on writing to this from userspace.
