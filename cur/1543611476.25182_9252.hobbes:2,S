    Not at all... Hungarian notation is not so bad, except it is only
understood by people from hungary. So the name }:))) I just use it
when I write code for Hungary or secret code that no one should
read...

    Here you are right. The code can be seen really as a book: you
can start reading at the middle and yet understand some of the story,
but it's far better when you start at the beginning ;))) Moreover,
most of the variable and function names in the kernel code are quite
descriptive, IMHO.
    Of course, more comments and more descriptive names doesn't harm,
but some times they bloat the code...
