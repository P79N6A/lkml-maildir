I tried to compile 2.4.0-test11-ac1, and here is where the compile bombed out:
/usr/bin/kgcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes 
-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe  -march=i686    -c -o 
sched.o sched.c
irq.c:182: conflicting types for `global_irq_lock'
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/hardirq.h:45: previous declaration of 
`global_irq_lock'
make[1]: *** [irq.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.0-test11-ac1/arch/i386/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_arch/i386/kernel] Error 2
Some additional information:
[root@spc linux]# which kgcc
/usr/bin/kgcc
[root@spc linux]# kgcc --version
egcs-2.91.66
[root@spc linux]# which make
/usr/bin/make
[root@spc linux]# make --version
GNU Make version 3.79.1, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.
Built for i586-mandrake-linux-gnu
I also had the reiserfs-3.6.19 patch applied, but the compile made it through
the reiserfs part successfully.  This all works just fine with 2.4.0-test11, 
where I used gcc 2.95.3 as supplied by Linux-Mandrake 7.2.
