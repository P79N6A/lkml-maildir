Yes.  And if you ask the average new Linux user if they've read it, I
doubt you'll get a "yes".  My question boils down to this, and this I
suppose is a personal/informational request for comments, so don't
clutter the list with responses directed at me:  What (in your opinion)
is the most commonly read Linux user-land document?
