No why would it need to change again?

The hotplug change would not need a rewrite of anything, just
some additional code in the SRAT parser to increase __VMALLOC_RESERVE for
each hotplug region. It's likely <= 3 additional lines.

Waiting for the maintainers? Why not? 
I assume the memory controller would be primarily used on larger
systems anyways and except for i386 these should be mostly 64bit
these days anyways.

I don't understand the rest of your point.
