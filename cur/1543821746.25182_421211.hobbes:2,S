Hi Stephen, 
We just got some new boxes and they have a sky2 nic onboard. The card seems ok but over time I start to get network drops. Also, If I restart the network I deadlocked the kernel unfortunately I don't have a stack dump of the crash.
I see you've made some changes in -git perhaps I should try a git snapshot to see if the sky2 issues have been fixed?
Thanks, 
Shawn.
