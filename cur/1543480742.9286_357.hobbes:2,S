	Linux linux-2.2.0pre8 "mkdir ." return ENOENT instead of
EEXIST.  This breaks the latest version of CVS when used on a local
repository.  Linux-2.2.0pre7 did not appear to have this problem,
and I have definitely confirmed that pre2 did not have this problem.
	If this change is a correction mandated by some standard,
then I am happy to patch cvs to fix the problem.  However, I think
this is probably a bug in the changes to fs/namei.c.
