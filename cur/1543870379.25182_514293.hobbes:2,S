Ok guys, I need a consensus here.  Are we going to allocate a second block of 4 minor 
numbers for the QE/CPM UART or not?
My driver already has a macro that limits the number of UARTS to 4, and it just uses minor 
numbers 47 through (47 + UCC_MAX_UART - 1).  So my driver can easily be modified to spill 
into the Altic's range if some custom board needs it.
I'll add a second TTY struct to handle the 2nd set of minor numbers if and only if 
devices-2.6+.txt is updated with that information.
