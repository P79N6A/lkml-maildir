If you want it to be seamless, you really can't do that. USB is a polled
bus, so the HC needs to send something to the device so it tells us that
something has changed, like a device being plugged into a hub (not the root
hub).

Thanks for the patch. I'll integrate into my patch and send it off to Linus
as well after I run it through it's paces.
It looks good on visual inspection atleast.
