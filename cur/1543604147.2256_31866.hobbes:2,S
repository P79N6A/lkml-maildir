 codec->read_mixer = ac97_read_mixer;  //can be called holding spinlock
 codec->write_mixer = ac97_write_mixer; //can be called holding spinlock
 codec->recmask_io = ac97_recmask_io;
 codec->mixer_ioctl = ac97_mixer_ioctl; //in general can't be called
holding spinlock
and ac97_mixer_ioctl() itself calls ac97_read/write_mixer().
A semaphore on the mixer device open function would do just fine If I
didn't had an interrupt handler also touching the ac97_codec...
