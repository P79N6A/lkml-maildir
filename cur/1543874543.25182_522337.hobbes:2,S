I wouldn't worry about micro-optimizing it at that level.  The CPU does
enough stuff under the covers that I wouldn't worry about it at all.
I wonder if the real differential impact (if any) is likely to come from
the pagetable_ops cacheline being hot or cold, since it is in a
different place in the structure than the flags.  But, from a quick
glance I see a few vm_ops references preceding pagetable_ops references,
so the pagetable_ops cacheline might already be hot most of the time.  
BTW, are there any other possible users for these things other than
large pages?
