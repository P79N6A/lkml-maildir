Hummm... he said "a more or less critical server, those that have active
security support or receive at least critical bugfixes". So he does not
want surprizes :-)

I would suggest stable - N-1 for most usages. 2.6.24.y is open, 2.6.23.y is
supposed to be good. The advantage when you proceed like this is that you
can jump from an older kernel to a more recent one which has already got its
share of fixes and is still maintained for some time.
Generally, I would trust Greg when he drops an old kernel, it means that he's
confident enough in the next one.
