Hi, I am curious about the maximum value of wmem_max and rmem_max.
As far as I know the values of them are maximum byte size of send buffer
and receive buffer allocated for a socket.
What I'm wondering is how much memory we can assign for them.
Can we assign the whole memory space for them? Or is there any limitation
of the values?
