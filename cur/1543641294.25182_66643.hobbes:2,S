Don't do that then.  Why would you need to check the battery status
every second?  Check every 30 seconds.  Does your battery even update its
status more often than that?

Interesting ... Howlong does "cat /proc/apm" take?
On my Thinkpad T22 I get:
# time cat /proc/apm
1.16 1.2 0x03 0x01 0x00 0x01 99% -1 ?
real	0m0.009s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.010s
while ...
# time ./tppow
Battery 0 present power units mW[h] design capacity 38880 last full charge capacity 29260
status 0x0 rate 0 cap 29172 voltage 12485
real	0m0.311s
user	0m0.100s
sys	0m0.000s
tppow is a C implementation of the disassembled APCI method for reading the
battery status. It does not disable interrupts but does talk to the
embedded controller in the Thinkpad.

This just means that we enter the BIOS with interrupts enabled, it doesn't
stop the BIOS from disabling interrupts ...
