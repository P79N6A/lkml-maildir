You do not specify exactly what your problem is (error message, where, etc.) 
so I am not sure I can help you or not. I had a problem with 2.2x kernels 
booting but not any 2.4.x ones with loadlin but only when "initrd" (ramdisk 
as "root" filesystem) was used. The symptom was the kernel would attempt to 
load but a insuficient memory error (I think it said you must have at least 
4MB) then it would hang. If you have this problem and if you exactly 64MB of 
ram, then what seems to happen is loadlin probes for and finds the correct 
amount of memory. Then it loads the 2.4.x kernel into a buffer. The kernel 
then attempts boot just the "boot" sector stuff. This again probes for the 
total amount of system ram (64MB). But, because of the much greater size of 
2.4.x kernels some memory location that himem uses (I think - maybe BIOS 
though) in relation to "memory size determination" gets over wiritten when 
loadlin filed the "buffer". The only workaround I have found so far for this 
is to pass on the loadlin command line the extra "boot param" of:
    mem=64M
so that the kernel does not probe.
