Wow! I will try it. Is it too much to ask that it be implemented
correctly?
	Wonder how it will handle
		mov  al, byte ptr [foo]
		mov  ax, word ptr [foo]
		mov  eax, dword ptr [foo]
		fsub qword ptr [foo]
		lidt fword ptr [foo]
	I gotta check it out............
If this stuff works, then there was no reason to change the boot code
to AT&T syntax. Just do, as you say, '.intel_syntax' and assemble.
