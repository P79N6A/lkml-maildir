Agreed it's doable but the list of things to synchronize tends to grow
and it's really hurts when it does.  Also, the list becomes much less
different between async and threaded model with multi processor support.

Well, if you go that far, it's basically async model with multiprocessor
support.  Not my favorite one.  :-)

Yeap, it's getting off-topic.  Let's see what future brings.  :-)
Thanks.
