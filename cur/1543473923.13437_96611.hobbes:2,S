    On the contrary. Its *exactly* the fact that there wasn't a good
    *free* driver for the Turtle Beach WaveFront soundcards that made me
    write one.
I'm glad that you responded in that way, but I don't think there's a
conflict with what I said.  We don't *need* to tell all the users
about a non-free program, to make it clear to hackers that there
isn't a free program to do the job.
If some hackers will get inspiration from the knowledge that a
proprietary driver exists, it is enough to tell the hackers--perhaps
by sending mail to linux-kernel.  There's no need to tell all the
users about it, and certainly no need to tell them where to get it!
