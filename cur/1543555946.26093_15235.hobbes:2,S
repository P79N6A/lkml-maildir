When the oops is inside an interrupt, ther in no sync, and the only information
is on the 24 lines of the screen (not 25, because the oops ends with a "\n"
that kills one line at the top.
When you have a minor oops, you can add all information you want.
when you have a major oops that stops the machine,
implying a restart with fsck, you have only 25x80 characters.
So, 5 chars between 2 words is TOO MUCH !
why do not use only ONE special character as "~" "!" or ";"
instead of ">] [<"

yes, but use a marker made of only ONE character !
