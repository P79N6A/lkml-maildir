I'd really like to know why the two can't coexist, first.  And I'd really
prefer a patch that make the two load and run with bay functionality
concurrently.  ACPI_BAY doesn't work right with bay batteries, and I didn't
find a way to fix that yet (or I'd have sent in patches).
Otherwise, please change the patch to a "depends on ACPI_BAY=n ||
ACPI_BAY=m".
