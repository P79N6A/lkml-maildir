Good day,
I was looking into IPC on Linux the other day, and realized that most of the
parameters are not tunable through sysctl.  The only one that is tunable is
shmmax.  Now that Linux is being adopted by many large vendors such as
Oracle and soon BEA Systems, I was thinking it is time to start making these
parameters as easily tunable as possible.  Many applications use message
queues, semaphores and shared memory and are not about to change, and
generally need to tune these parameters to suit their needs.  Most people
are used to the commercial Unix interfaces for doing this (eg.  /etc/system
on Solaris, /etc/conf.d/stune.d/ in UnixWare.)
I wanted to start working on making these variables tunable, and I wanted to
check and see if there was a reason that this has not been done so far.  I
realize that some of the parameters are derived, and some, like MSGMNI
cannot be changed without a recompile, but administrators may benefit from 
being able to change the other values on the fly, with care of course.
Thanks for any input you can offer,
Sean
