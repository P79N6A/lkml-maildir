Interestingly enough, the local variable case is one where "memory" does
make a difference.  Without "memory":
        movl    p, %eax
        movl    (%eax), %eax
#APP
#NO_APP
With "memory":
#APP
#NO_APP
        movl    p, %eax
        movl    (%eax), %eax

As you can see from above, there are cases where
   local_var = shared->mumble;
   // ...
   spin_lock (&spinlock);
   local_var = shared->mumble;
requires a "memory" clobber, otherwise the second read, which is in a
critical region, won't be emitted by the compiler.

ps. There is a _clobber_ for memory, but no way to say "this asm _reads_
arbitrary memory".  __volatile__ may be filling that role though.
