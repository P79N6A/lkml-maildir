Note that this should all be trivial, and in fact I think everybody shares 
the same smplock.h these days. The x86 smplock.h is 100% C - even though 
it's not actually totally visible because we still have some old asm 
routines visible that are just #ifdef'ed out.
In fact, I'll clean that up a bit to make it clearer.

Actually, on slight introspection I suspect the better answer is to make
the BKL bit somewhere higher up, since BKL is much less interesting than
most spinlocks, and getting increasingly more so. But yes.
