Yeah, I wish you the best. There's always been quite a bit of code to
show, but that alone didn't convince people ;-) I've certainly grown a
bit more experienced / cynical during that time. (Which, according to
Oscar Wilde, is the same anyway ;)

Yes, they have some common requirements on the kernel VFS layer, though
Lustre certainly has the most extensive demands. I hope someone from CFS
Inc can make it to your summit.

Is there a KS presentation on this? I didn't get invited to KS and will
just be allowed in for OLS, but I'll be around town already...

Thanks for the pointer, this is a good read.

Your fencing system is fine with me; based on the assumption that you
always have to fence a failed node, you are doing the right thing.
However, the issues are more subtle when this is no longer true, and in
a 1:1 how do you arbitate who is allowed to fence?

Right, cluster resource management is one of the things where I'm quite
happy with the approach the new heartbeat resource manager is heading
down (or up, I hope ;).

You can plug multiple ones as long as they are managing independent
resources, obviously. However, if the CRM is the one which ultimately
decides whether a node needs to be fenced or not - based on its
knowledge of which resources it owns or could own - this gets a lot more
scary still...

Mostly, yes. Unless you (like some) require quorum to report a cluster
membership, which some implementations do.

Uhm, do I have to be frightened of being fenced? ;)
