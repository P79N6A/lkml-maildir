I'm not absolutely sure about the status of the PCI support, but it
should be close to working. Anyway, the driverfs infrastructure itself
is in place in 2.5, so even if the PCI part wasn't there, still we can
convert USB and Input to it.

Ahh, I see. This "devpath" entry wasn't available at the time I wrote
the 'usb_make_path' function. This is of course much better. What's not
very convenient for me right now is that it uses slashes instead of
dots, which the input subsystem uses for delimiting busses from each
other, like:
isa0060/serio0/input0 - AT keyboard
pci0:7.3/usb1:2.2/input0 - USB keboard
Using slashes in place of the dots would make it quite a mess. The
slashes are probably there because of usbdevfs, right?
Note that the PCI "slot_name" doesn't use slashes ...
