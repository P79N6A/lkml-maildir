I downloaded the DRI CVS tree this morning and tried to build it, but
unfortunately it failed in numerous ways.  Starting here:
as -o 3dnow_xform_masked4.o 3dnow_xform_masked4.i
Assembler messages:
Error: Can't open 3dnow_xform_masked4.i for reading.
3dnow_xform_masked4.i: No such file or directory
make[6]: *** [3dnow_xform_masked4.o] Error 1
Maybe I'll try building without the 3DNow business.  Do you think that
will help?
