I have applied the libata patch 1 to kernel 2.6.0-test10.  I can now see the 
PDC RAID controller via the hardware browser, but I can not see any of the 
attatched PATA drives.  (I do not have any SATA drives).
I have tried the controller set to RAID and IDE.  I can not locate the 
attached PATA drives in /proc/ide or /proc/scsi, nor does the hardware 
browser see them.  I #define ATA_VERBOSE_DEBUG and I did not find any 
addtional output in dmesg.
Does this driver not support PATA drives attatched to this controller?
Thanks for any help.
