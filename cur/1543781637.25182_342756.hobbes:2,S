Is there a way to know which task has a particular (struct semaphore *)
down()ed, leading to another task's down() blocking on it?
I'm trying to debug a priority inversion caused by potentially a real
low priority SCHED_OTHER task (potentially a kernel thread like
kjournald) holding an inode->i_sem semaphore for a file that is blocking
a write() from a high-priority (50) SCHED_FIFO task.
It would be helpful to get a kernel stacktrace for the culprit too.
Thanks

Ps: ideally I would like to do this from a module/probe I can insert in
a system that is stuck in this state, because I don't want to Heisenberg
the setup with a kdb or otherwise instrumented kernel.
