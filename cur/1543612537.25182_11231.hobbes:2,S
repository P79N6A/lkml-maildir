Yuck!  CML1 outputs integers as #define CONFIG_foo (number) instead of
just number.  CML2 does not do that, I was looking at CML2.  Add this
to drivers/isdn/Makefile
CFLAGS_foo.o += -DMAX_CARDS=$(subst (,,$(subst ),,$(CONFIG_HISAX_MAX_CARDS)))
In foo.c, use MAX_CARDS instead of CONFIG_HISAX_MAX_CARDS.  Change foo
to the name of the object that you are working on.  When you build, it
should say -DMAX_CARDS=8.
