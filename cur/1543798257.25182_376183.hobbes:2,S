I was under the impression that with cmpxchg, you don't need the mutex lock.
If you do then sure, cmpxchg doesn't buy you anything (even if the arch does
natively support it).

I think all of about parisc and sparc32 "emulate" cmpxchg with spinlocks.
For architectures like i386, x86_64, ppc, ia64, etc. the cmpxchg will
give good code.
Then if FRV was still unhappy, then you could override the mutex in that
architecture. This just seemed better to me than having a crappy simple
implementation that *everyone* will want to override (and I see FRV
overrides it as well, I don't see how you can complain about that).
But I guess that's moot if you can't to do a lockless version using
cmpxchg.

I'm sure you'd manage. spinlocks can get pretty large with debugging on too.
