   sorry for my ignorance, but when you say book, do you mean ip-cref.tex?
   in iproute2/doc
Yes.
   in iproute2/doc/Plan there are references to:
   api-rtnl.tex
   api-pmtudisc.tex
   api-misc.tex
   iki-netdev.tex
   iki-neighdst.tex
   do these exist?
They are in the process of completion, ask Alexey himself for a more
accurate updated status :-)
Later,
