The reason I've liked this format is that it gives me a quick and 
universal way to find *specific* functions with vi or grep, by 
searching for "^function_name(".
I'm less concerned with global function searches; there I don't mind 
the overhead of more sophisticated tools.
When we're done with this thread, perhaps we can return to endian arguments....
