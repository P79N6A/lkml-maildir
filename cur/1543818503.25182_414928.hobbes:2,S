kbuild does not support a single-file module being written entirely in
assembler.
kbuild obviously support multi file modules where one file is in
assembler.
In your example you generate a multi file module where some files are in
assembler - supported.
And the point was that one should NOT define private rules like:
%.o:	%.S
	as -o $@ $<
If there is a valid need for such stuff - then kbuild needs to be fixed.
But I have yet to see a need like this.
I know several external modules plays all sort of tricks to avoid using
kbuild infrastructure - I recall you have posted such receipts before.
Recently posted loop-aes is another example (if USE_KBUILD is not set).
