Supplementary or Alternatively, all of the ATA device commands issued by hdparm
can be supported in a driver by simply implementing the HDIO_DRIVE_CMD
ioctl -- This is only a few lines of code in a typical SATA/SCSI driver,
and I could easily supply a patch to implement it in libata.
Sure it's old, looks clunky, but it is simple code that works
and is used by many more tools than just hdparm today.
