Truth is always painful. :-)
Greg had a good article on LWN: 
http://lwn.net/Articles/189467/.
 There you could find a more painful truth. You know what the real
reason is that suspend2 couldn't get merged? Not Nigel, not Pavel, but Linus, because he personally doesn't care. So if you want to
have a high-quality suspend-to-disk, your best bet is to convince Linus to use it. :-)
(well I'm partly joking here, but the above article and the corresponding thread is a well-worthy read
(

).
Some of the Linus quotes that you may find interesting :-)
