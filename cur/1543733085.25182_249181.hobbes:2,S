I'll second that motion.  Match size, or return -EINVAL.
My understanding of "asking for it" requires at present a user code
loop, to probe for the size that works.  But my user code already does
that, and the first thing for which I audit any changes to this kernel
code is not breaking my sizing loop code in user space.
I'd mildly prefer adding a kernel/user API for explicitly providing the
two values:
	sizeof(cpumask_t)
	sizeof(nodemask_t)
This might help reduce the unending confusions in the user and library
code sitting on top of us.
We could two phase this:
 1) add an obvious way to size these masks, and then
 2) six months later, require sizes to match in all these calls.
I for one could live with a full and sudden change over, no phasing.
But apparently my field exposure is more limited than Andi's is, at
this time.
