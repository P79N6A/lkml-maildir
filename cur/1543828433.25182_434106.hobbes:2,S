The problem is this is not the first time I mentioned this and some 
patches still have no descriptions at all! :-(

For a lot of things this acceptable, but if patches (e.g. clockevents) add 
new generic infrastructure which effect all archs, they need 
documentation (unless you also provide all the arch specific changes).

I can't do this without documentation. Without any information I'm only 
wondering why it has to be this complex.
For example clockevents, I think all the special event handlers are 
overkill, a simple list would do just fine. This way it may also possible 
to treat a clock as virtual interrupt source and we could share code with 
interrupt code and a callback can simply be requested via request_irq().
More information about what this code actually intends to do and what it 
is required to do, would help a great deal to judge alternative solutions, 
but only the author of this code can really provide this information and 
IMO it's really sad that this information is still lacking after being 
requested multiple times.
bye, Roman
