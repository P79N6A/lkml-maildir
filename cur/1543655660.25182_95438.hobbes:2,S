I think the scrollmode is better determined on a case-to-case basis, but
the above should be a good enough differentiation.

Yes, probably not much at low pixel depths, but at high pixel depths and
resolutions, 2.5 should be much better than 2.4 (even 2-3x faster in
some cases).  And for drivers with hardware acceleration, whatever the
color depth, it will be much better because they were written
specifically for them. 
Personally, the performance gain is just a minor side-effect. The
greatest benefit in all this is the separation of the fbdev-fbcon
structure into components, where each component has a defined use and
function, and very much independent of each other.  This really makes it
easier to understand the code, port or write drivers too it, write
smaller and more efficient code, and even debug.  And you basically did
all this, so great job :-)

Yes, I think thats better.
