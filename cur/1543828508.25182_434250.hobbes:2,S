Hmm, I see what you mean. Except that I thought that I'd manually disabled the motherboard's
serial device on IRQ 3, via the BIOS:
Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ 4 ports, IRQ sharing enabled
serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
pnp: Device 00:07 activated.
00:07: ttyS2 at I/O 0x3e8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
pnp: Device 00:08 activated.
00:08: ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
Does Linux reenable all motherboard devices, regardless?
Cheers,
Chris
