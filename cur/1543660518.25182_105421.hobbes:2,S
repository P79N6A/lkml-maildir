   That's like saying that its Linus's or Marcelo's responsibility
   to catch whether you or anyone else submits a bogus/broken change
   to their tree.
Your driver update broke the build of Linus's tree, so I sent Linus
a change that fixed the build.
And in fact, you are describing exactly what Linus and Marcelo's
jobs are, to reject bogus/broken changes.
