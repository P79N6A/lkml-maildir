Not guilty.  If I remember correctly, the list was set up by the vger
list maintainers (davem and company).  It was tied to a trigger in one
of your trees (which I think Larry did).  It shouldn't be too difficult
to add to git ... it just means traversing all the added patches on a
merge and sending out mail.
I can try out your source control tools ... I have some rc fixes
ready ... when you're ready to try out merges...
