i logged these not via netconsole but via logging on over the console 
and using dmesg, so it should include everything. in the 100hz case the 
following seems to show the anomaly:
  NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
indeed it's not followed by the e1000 messages. (perhaps i didnt wait 
long enough to reboot the box - i zapped it after a minute of uptime)
