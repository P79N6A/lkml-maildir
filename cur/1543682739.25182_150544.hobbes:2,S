Thanks for the clarification. I am using mlockall on the user application. This 
still leaves me with the mystery of why my system usage goes from 3% to
50% randomly while playing data streams off the harddrive. I can also make
system usage stay at 50% by opening a third stream.
These streams are pulling data at 1.5MB/s each from different files (same HD).
I don't see that as a big strain on the hardware (4.5MB/s total data rate).
Where else should I look to find the bottleneck/latency issue?
Regards,
J. Deas

Errrrr ... Sorry, I did not read your mail carefully ;-(
I meant in case of a user process you can use mlock() and such :)
AFAIK the kernel itself is not pagable ...
