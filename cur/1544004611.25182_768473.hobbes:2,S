I looked into the PCI and driver core code again, but didn't figured out how
to do it.
A 'pci_dev' is added by pci_bus_add_device() via device_add(), which creates
sysfs entries according to 'dev_attrs' in the 'pci_bus_type'. If we want those
dynamic entries to appear before the uevent is triggered, we have to bundle
them into the 'dev_attrs'. Is this right way for the dynamic entries? Or I
missed something?
