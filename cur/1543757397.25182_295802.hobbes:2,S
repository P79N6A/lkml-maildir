Indeed, but they normally repeat by powers of 2, ignoring
high order address bits. Is it that hard to detect?
For example if it declares 128k, compare the two halves, reduce
to 64k if equal. Lather, rinse, repeat.
It's equivalent to reading the BAR declared size twice in 
the worst case, so it's not that bad performance-wise.
That would only be in the case of an unknown signature
in the first bytes, otherwise the third byte gives you
the size IIUC.
