You are assuming that dma_alloc_coherent() will always return memory of
that second kind -- host-side RAM, not PCI-side. That hasn't previously
been a requirement, and there are machines out there on which it makes a
lot more sense for dma_alloc_coherent() to use some SRAM which happens
to be hanging off the I/O bus than it does to use host RAM.
Doing dma_map_to_pfn() instead of dma_map_to_page() would work. That
means you can't use nopage() for mappings of dma_coherent memory. That's
fine though.

No. It'd be OK if you make it dma_map_to_pfn() instead of
dma_map_to_page() though. As discussed, that means you can't use
nopage() for mappings of dma_coherent memory. That's fine though.
I think it would be better to provide arch-specific functions for
mapping dma_coherent allocations and SG lists. On most architectures we
can just do it with virt_to_page() and nopage() and it'll be OK. On
others we can do the right thing as appropriate.
