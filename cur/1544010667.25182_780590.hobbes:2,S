Okay, so we pretty much	know that ext3 journalling helps in "user hit
the reset button" case. (And we are pretty sure ext2/ext3 works in
"clean unmount" case). Otherwise
*) kernel bug -> journalling does not help.
*) sudden powerfail -> journalling helps works on SGI high-end
hardware. It may or may not help on PC-class hardware.
We already do periodic checks, even on ext3. Maybe we should do fsck
more often if we see evidence of unclean shutdowns (because we know
PC hardware is crap...). I actually have patch somewhere, should I
ressurect it?
