NAK.  ->base_addr casting is a Bad Idea(tm) and natsemi "solution" isn't
(thanks for spotting that crap in natsemi, though; will fix...)
Note that there is no such thing as "generic IO base address" - it _is_
private and in the best case current ->base_addr is a scratch register
probably used for something vaguely connected with some IO, but it's
really up to driver...
