I'm saying it can. I don't want to go too deep into an arguement about
microarchitectural details, but my point was that a memory copy of a page
is NOT super expensive relative to several other effects that have to do
with pagetable manipulations.

but the pipe code cannot know this so it has to do a cross cpu invalidate.

and... which is also releasing it before the copy
