Not strictly speaking a part of our commercial product but based on the 
CPU scheduling technology in that product.  As you know, the CPU 
scheduler in the kernel based versions of our product relies on a 
generic "plug in scheduler" interface being present in the host kernel 
and runtime loadable kernel modules plug into that interface and take 
over scheduling.  This mechanism (while allowing our product to work on 
a number of different host operating systems) has the disadvantage that 
it adds some overhead to the scheduler (this is in addition to the extra 
overhead involved in hierarchical scheduling) and places some 
restrictions on the scheduler design as it cannot make too many 
assumptions about the underlying scheduler in the host operating system.
When the technology is used to build an embedded scheduler (as is the 
case with EBS) significant improvements in efficiency can be realised. 
So EBS is a souped up, non hierarchical version of our CPU scheduler 
designed specially for Linux.
