Eh?  What do you mean "We are in set_page_dirty"?
The main caller of page_mkwrite() is do_wp_page().  With my patch, this
function does the following steps in order:
	(1) Invoke page_mkwrite() if available, giving SIGBUS on error.
	(2) Mark the PTE writable and dirty.
	(3) Unlock the page table.
Then with Peter's patch:
	(4) Invoke set_page_dirty_balance().
We shouldn't be having to handle an error at step (4), and we shouldn't be
marking the page dirty before step (2).
In fact, it could be argued that we shouldn't be marking the page dirty until
it is actually dirty, but I can't see any way to do that atomically short of
emulating the store instruction without hardware support.

In general, we really really shouldn't just remove the page.  The only place I
would consider it appropriate to destroy a dirty page is if we can't write it
back because the backing store is no longer available due to an event we
cannot predict (network filesystems for example).
We should operate on preventative measures rather than curative ones: we
should detect ENOSPC in advance and signal the process doing the write that
that it's not permitted to proceed.  We shouldn't go and kill all the
processes that might write to that mapping.
Prevention is almost always cleaner than trying to fix things up afterwards.

It's not exactly the same.  It's almost the same difference as between
prepare_write() and commit_write().  Currently it's very much the same
because, as I understand it, the PTE dirty flag is transferred to the page
struct when the PTE is destroyed (in zap_pte_range()).
Actually, I'm not sure that calling set_page_dirty() at the bottom of
do_wp_page() is necessarily a good idea.  It's possible that the page will be
marked dirty in do_wp_page() and then will get written back before the write
actually succeeds.  In other words the page may be marked dirty and cleaned up
all before the modification _actually_ occurs.  On the other hand, the common
case is probably that the store instruction will beat the writeback.
Of course, if you're proposing to call set_page_dirty() before the PTE is
modified, that would work.  But you still have to make sure that it isn't
called under spinlock, and doing that would make zap_pte_range() potentially
indulge in lock thrashing.

It's better than having unwritable pages sat around in the pagecache because
there's no space on the backing device to write them back.  At least this way
gives a graceful way to handle the situation.
Destroying uncommitted data isn't really an acceptable answer.
