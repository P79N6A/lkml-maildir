I prefer explainable behaviours :)
If 2 processes start reading at offset 0xfffffffe, and one of them reads 1
byte and the second 2 bytes, I can expect the file position be 0xffffffff,
0x100000000, 0x100000001, or, in the worst case, 0xfffffffe again.
But 0x1ffffffff will be a real surprise.
For a bigger surprise, we can kill one of the processes with SIGFPE if we
find that the processes perform such an "incorrect" parallel read and the
file position has changed behind us ;)
But we don't want that much undefined behaviour, do we? :)
