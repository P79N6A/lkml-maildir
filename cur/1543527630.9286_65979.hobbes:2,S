I have a pair of 3Com 3c905c's that work just great with the 2.2 kernels
(okay, why aren't I running 905b's - I got a deal on 'em)  but booting up
with 2.3.47 shows:
3Com 3c905C Tornado at 0x6800, *** INVALID CHECKSUM 002f ***
and about the same for the 2nd card.
Pardon my censored French, but while it's fine for a driver to complain if
it thinks it should get some particular checksum from the NIC (or is this
an internal driver error purely?), after it complains it should go on and
get to work. It's not like we don't already have code that can run these
cards.
Sign me "still looking for an option to daily tcp_keepalive crashes",
