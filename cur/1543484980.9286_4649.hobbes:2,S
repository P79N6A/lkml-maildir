Hi!
We have a switched ethernet/token ring network environment based on
cabletron switch hardware (SmartSwitch 6000 and SmartSwitch 9000).
The problem:
  I can't reach a Workstation or Server in the switched
  token ring segment with a linux box in the ethernet segement
  (i. e. ping, telnet etc.). If I manually add the mac-address of
  the destination in the token ring to the local arp cache of the
  linux box in the ethernet, all communication works fine.
With some work on sniffering the network and some help of cabletron
technical support I find out the following:
The linux box sends the arp request packet with hardware type 1 but
the switch replies the packet with hardware type 6 in the arp packet.
It seems that linux don't understand hardware type 6 - I'm not sure.
I looked at rfc1042, were it is described but I can't find any useful
information.
Any idea on this issue?
Cabletron technical support told me, there will be a firmware upgrade
wich brings a solution for non rfc1042 compliant components. So the
switch will send two arp packets one with hardware type 1 and another
with hardware type 6.
I did tests on Linux 2.0.x, 2.1.x and 2.2.x all with the result
described above.
thanks
