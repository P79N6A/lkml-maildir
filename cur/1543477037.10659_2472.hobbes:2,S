Subject: sys_read broken for various /proc files

The Linux kernel when requested to read n bytes from a file from /proc
will ignore the request and stuff as many bytes as it feels like
stuffing. 
I include a tests program:
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
static char buffer [8];
main ()
{
	int fd;
	printf ("Before: [%s]\n", buffer);
	
	fd = open ("/proc/locks", O_RDONLY);
	if (fd == -1){
		printf ("Can not open /proc/locks");
		exit (1);
	}
	read (fd, buffer, 1);
	read (fd, buffer, 1);
	read (fd, buffer, 1);
	read (fd, buffer, 1);
	read (fd, buffer, 1);
	read (fd, buffer, 1);
	read (fd, buffer, 1);
	printf ("Read: [%s]\n", buffer);
}
