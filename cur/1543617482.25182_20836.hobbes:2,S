Oh, I check some time ago. Sorry for baing vague, but as I said, we expect
to post more info in a couple of days. 
The card was in a slot that shares an IQR with something called "serial bus
controller" (and USB gadget, I gather.) It's _not_ in the slot that shares
the IRQ with (both) HPT370 controllers.
USB is disabled in BIOS and in kernel config. Ansolutely no USB devices
attached.

No. I'm pretty positive this is a case of Via PCI being flaky.
