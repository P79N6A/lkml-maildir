I have assigned Alexei Adamovich to work full-time on the task until you and
Alexander Viro say that it is done right.  It will get cleaned up; Alexei is a
good programmer.  Some changes have already been made and we are testing them.

If reiserfs is marked as experimental and in, then making it non-experimental
and in, a few weeks from now, is quite likely to happen.  Real users always find
things that testers don't, but they won't find such a lot when it is a port from
2.2 of code that has been in widespread production use for some time now.
Do you want to leave lack of a journaling file system as a bullet point favoring
Win2k?
