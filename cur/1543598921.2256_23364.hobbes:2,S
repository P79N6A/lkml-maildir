Dan, sorry for the response delay but I was in Vacation Mode ( new CPU execution mode
that will be included in the next x86 generation ).
I trashed my original idea to extend /dev/epoll to other other files coz this will make the
patch way more intrusive. The only easy extension that comes in my mind is pipes.
As soon as I'll finish to read the remaining 4231 messages in my mbox I'll fix /dev/epoll
to get rid of stale events that I ( and Erich Nahum ) noticed in the current implementation.
