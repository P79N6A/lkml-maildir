Hi,
Ingo reported a severe 3ware corruption bug today which I've fixed, so
it seemed due time for a new version of the patch.
- Fix scsi_merge not setting sg->address for "legacy" drivers not using
  the PCI DMA interface. Stupid bug, since the entire I/O path is
  supposed to remain untouched (basically) for drivers not enabling
  highmem... I really think this is the last of such bugs. (me)
- Add 'nohighio' boot flag to disable I/O to highmem I/O. x86 only (me)
- Finally remember to reverse size/offset arguments in cciss and
  cpqarray. Fixed a long time ago, forgot to commit to the tree... (me,
  arjan, others)
- aic7xxx uses wrong DMA mask (arjan)
- Remove SCSI host single_sg_ok, it is implied by can_dma_32 anyways
  (arjan)
- Enable can_dma_32 on aic7xxx_old (arjan)
Patch is considered solid. Find it here:
