Thanks Alan, 
   I also read on the Linux-Kernel that the problem may be related to an 
exhaustion of your kernels address space, I read that the hugemem-kernel 
might be the solution to this case since it has 4GB for the kernel memory 
plus 4GB for user process. 
How can I define if my kernel memory is beeing exhausted? Does this 
exhaustion of kernel memory can cause Out Of memory errors ?
