Bzzzzt. According to WikiPedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address
MAC addresses are used for:
- Token ring
- 802.11 wireless networks
- Bluetooth
- FDDI
- ATM (switched virtual connections only, as part of an NSAP address)
- SCSI and Fibre Channel (as part of a World Wide Name)
FDDI = fiber, ATM = ATM.
