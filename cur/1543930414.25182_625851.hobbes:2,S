Ahh, yes, that's true. I'd somehow missed that we effectively had a
tap at 0, so I thought this was actually improving the situation. I'll
replace this with a comment explaining the situation.

I'm working on strengthening forward security for cases where the
internals are exposed to an attacker. There are any number of
situations where this can and does happen, and ensuring we don't
expose ourselves to backtracking is a worthwhile theoretical concern.
