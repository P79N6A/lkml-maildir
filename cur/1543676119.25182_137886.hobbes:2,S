Subject: orinoco_cs module removal problem

I just switched from 2.5.68 to 2.5.70, and I'm having trouble removing
the orinoco_cs module on the fly. After bringing the interface down,
doing an "rmmod orinoco_cs" causes the rmmod process to lock up, and
subseqeunt invocations of lsmod and 'cat /proc/modules' to do the same.
I get a bunch of messages like the following in the kernel log:
"unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth2 to become free. Usage count = 1
However, eth2, the orinoco device, no longer exists (it's not listed
in /proc/net/dev).
