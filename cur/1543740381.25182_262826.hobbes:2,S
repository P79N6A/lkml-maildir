If i could buy a card with complete documentation as original poster 
proposed, and with reprogramable logic, i would be willing to pay as 
much as 125 EURO/Dollar.
Key features for me are:
DVI out
no fan
very low power requirements, something like < 4.5Watt
must be able to play fair with my second gfx card for gaming(deactivated 
when i work)
basic SDK
Cool extras would be (2D):
video acceleration (compatible with XvMC)
texture/overlay scaling in hardware
alpha blending
advanced SDK
For 3D acceleration in the range of something between geforce1 and 
geforce2 (i own a geforce2 and its fast enough for every game i play)
i would pay an extra $$$ like 150-200 EURO/Dollar.
Lots of money, but thinking of lost time reading bug-reports, howtos and 
fixing all kinds of instability related problems, its allmost nothing.
