Actually, that's been the intention all along. The PCI code may not 
support it today (I haven't looked at it in a while), but there is no 
reason why the parent for a host bridge couldn't be set, and the bridge 
show up in the proper place in the hierarchy. 
And, if it isn't set, then it shows up under the root, which makes sense 
physically and conceptually.
