ioremap_nocache does the following:
	return __ioremap(offset, size, _PAGE_PCD);
However, in drivers/char/mem.c (2.4.0), we see the following:
	/* On PPro and successors, PCD alone doesn't always mean 
	    uncached because of interactions with the MTRRs. PCD | PWT
	    means definitely uncached. */ 
	if (boot_cpu_data.x86 > 3)
		prot |= _PAGE_PCD | _PAGE_PWT;
Does this mean ioremap_nocache() may not do the job?
