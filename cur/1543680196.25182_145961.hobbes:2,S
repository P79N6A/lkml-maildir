   crypto/arch/ sounds like a bad idea.  We really should avoid arch code
   outside arch/ and include/asm*.  So arch/<foo>/crypto/ as suggested by
   Thomas is much better.
   
I totally disagree.  I think the way we do things today is _STUPID_.
We put arch code far away from the generic version which makes finding
stuff very difficult for people inspecting the code for the first time.
For example, the fact that I have to go groveling in
arch/foo/lib/whoknowswhatfile.whoknowswhatextension to look at
the memcpy/checksum/whatever implementation is completely busted.
So, I totally support making crypto/arch/ directories.
