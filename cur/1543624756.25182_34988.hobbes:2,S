I have to disagree.  It is the woken up task *running on the
otherwise idle CPU* that burns up 200 cycles at the tail.
A cpu is wasting, say, 5,000,000 cycles (1GHz/100/2, or 1/2 tick) in
hlt when it could have been doing work.  Why worry about an
alternative wakeup path that burns up 200-400 cycles of that on the
otherwise idling cpu, even if it is at the tail.
