I'll correct myself then: there were non exec stack patches.   Keep in
mind  part of the problem is that some compilors actually use that feature
look up "trampolines" for more info.
Also I was in error to refer to it as stack guarding.. Stack guard is a
compilor. I acually use libsafe it's preferable for 2 reasons. 
  1 It's entirely userspace and it works fine.
  2 If someone manages to render it useless I'll simply uninstall it.

PS Although personally I think linux reoutation is most harmed by distribs
who insists on installing software with bad security records.  But that's
not relevent to linux-kernel.
