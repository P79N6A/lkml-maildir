They are both away (in Finnland and at LinuxExpo)
Various more extensive versions of this idea (it is originally from Stephen
Tweedie I think) have been tested and developed by Ingo Molnar,David Miller 
and others. Unfortunately some versions caused crashed, but they were 
explained by compiler overoptimizations (egcs 1.1 moved some instructions 
across the optimization barrier in the locking macro, which caused races 
under heavy load; gcc 2.7.2 should be fine). For the tcp_do_sendmsg case 
there were no problems AFAIK.
If you don't believe me :) you can verify it:
	csum_and_copy_from_user
		does user access
		hits a page that is not present
CPU raises page not present exception
	calls arch/i386/mm/fault.c:do_page_fault() 
	calls mm/memory.c:handle_mm_fault()
	calls handle_pte_fault (same file)
	calls finally do_swap_page (same file)
	and there at the end is:
		unlock_kernel();
		return 1;
now the exception processing ends.
in the interrupt return code (arch/i386/kernel/entry.S:ret_with_reschedule)
it may switch to another process etc.

I expect the work will be first tested in 2.3, and then after some time
backported to a 2.2 "enterprise" release (similar to the 2.0.30 release
which backported the 2.1 socket hash optimizations to make Linux scale
to a really huge number of sockets)
