Thanks for the feedback!

I do want more people to test it and I agree that hooking onto
user-id based groups is the best way to get that done. How do we
implement that? I have two choices:
1. Do a kernel patch, as you suggest above, which defines task-groups
   based on user-id and hook that group definition with group scheduler.
   We need to provide some means for the admin to tune relative
   nice-value of each user (perhaps thr' sysctl?). 
   This user-id based grouping will have to be mutually exclusive with
   task-container based grouping. Hence we need to ensure that only one
   form of grouping is selected and not both at compile time.
2. Enable only one form of grouping, which is task-container based. Provide a 
   user-space daemon (attached) which can automatically put tasks of different 
   users in different task-containers. The daemon will need to be started at 
   early boot-time. It can also be extended to support a configuration file
   (ex: inittab) where cpu allocation for different users are specified.
   The fact that daemon is managing to provide fair allocation to users
   should be transparent.
   I hope that task-containers (aka cgroups) will go into 2.6.24, in which case 
   the second option seems to be more attractive to me.
I will neverthless try to work out Option 1, just to see how it looks.
