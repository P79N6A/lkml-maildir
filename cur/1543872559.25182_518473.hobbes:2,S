Oh BTW, I have a newer version with a first approximation of the
cbrt() before the div64_64, which allows us to reduce from 3 div64
to only 2 div64. This results in a version which is twice as fast
as the initial one (ncubic), but with slightly less accuracy (0.286%
compared to 0.247). But I see that other functions such as hcbrt()
had a 1.5% avg error, so I think this is not dramatic.
Also, I managed to remove all other divides, to be kind with CPUs
having a slow divide instruction or no divide at all. Since we compute
on limited range (22 bits), we can multiply then shift right. It shows
me even slightly better time on pentium-m and athlon, with a slightly
higher avg error (0.297% compared to 0.286%), and slightly smaller
code.
I just have to clean experiments from my code to provide a patch.
David, Stephen, are you interested ?
