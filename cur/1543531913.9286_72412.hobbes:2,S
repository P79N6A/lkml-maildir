kswapd was running until it had a quantum, whether or not it had to
free any more pages.

Check out the linux-kernel archives, specifically for my mails about
NFS/sound problems - it is not good for processes (eg, rpciod) to be
starved of CPU time up to 200-400ms.  It was basically impossible to
play mp3s without the playback basically "stopping" for that period.
(without the patch in, I see kswapd using 200ms-400ms.  With the patch
in, it only uses >10ms very very rarely).
