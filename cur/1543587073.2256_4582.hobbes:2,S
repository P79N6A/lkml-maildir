2.4.4-p1 is the kernel version that i've tried now. no succes with 2.4.3 and
below.
i've been trying without the CDROM and a normal HDD ata 66. i've made some
progress using the normal ide ata 66 driver and removing the osv4 from
kernel.
root@light:/# hdparm -t -T /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.81 seconds =158.02 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   MB in  8.41 seconds =  7.61 MB/sec
root@light:/# hdparm -v /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 2586/240/63, sectors = 39102336, start = 0
still my bios is set to enhaced DMA. i am still working on UDMA. if u have
any suggestions i still wait for a solution.
