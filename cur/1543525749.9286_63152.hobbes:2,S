Hi Dominik.

Instability ALWAYS exists, given the right hardware combination.

The most obvious point is that they are "Dual P54C-200" systems, which
indicates that they are SMP systems ("Dual") running with non-MMX
Pentium processors ("P54C") clocked at 200 MHz ("-200").
ALAN: Am I right in thinking that there's a known bug in the P54C
processor regarding its use in SMP configurations, and one needs the
P55C (Px/MMX) processor as a minimum for reliable SMP operation?

That sounds like the bug referred to above is the cause.

It's good to hear, but I would still be wary of your choice of
processor in an SMP system.
Best wishes from Riley.
