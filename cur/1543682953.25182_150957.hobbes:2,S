I first posted about this several years ago, and it came up again earlier
in the year; see:
http://hypermail.idiosynkrasia.net/linux-kernel/archived/2003/week14/0314.html
As HPA and I had previously discussed, ->open() methods always return
a new file struct, so providing the dup() semantics would require a
restructuring of the ->open() methods -- unless, (and this is a dirty
hack,) one creates a devfdfs that abuses the ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK
mechanism to restart the open() syscall with dup() instead.  This requires
some minor pollution to the open() syscall path to interpret the error
return, but should require no other changes.
