For the record, I'd rather see explicite removal everwhere.  We received 
a number of complaints along the lines of "I run my app immediately after 
system startup, and it's fast, but the second time it's slower" due to 
the lazy page reclaim in early 2.4.  Until there's a way to make LRU 
scanning faster than page allocation, it can't be lazy.
