Hello,
Sorry for the long time without giving new information about the problem/bug, 
but I wasn't able to trigger it since now.
Well, this time, my system freeze on a 2.6.20.1.
I try to use the magic sysrq (which works fine when my system is running), but 
nothing happen (unraw, reboot, etc.).
Also, as I used the nvidia proprietary module when I reported this problem, 
I've not open PR at bugzilla.kernel.org.
During 5 days, my system on a fresh 2.6.20.1 hasn't freezed without the nvidia 
proprietary driver (just the nv driver from X).
So, I thought it was ok and I modprobe the nvidia driver (cause with nv I have 
some minor display problems). Since today, after 7 days of well-behavior, my 
system has freezed again.
So, now, I check again to see if it could crash without the nvidia driver... 
Grrrr.. 
I will also do what you recommend here :

I join the result of dmesg as wanted. Feel free to ask more information if 
needed.
(the cifs log looks like before so I haven't joined it)
Also, if you have some new ideas about the problem or what I could try to 
trigger it more frequently (I already wake up the NAS as more as I can, but 
maybe I could write a script to do that), I would be thankful.
Best regards,
	Eric Lacombe
