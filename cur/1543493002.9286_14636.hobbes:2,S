There is a number of things hwhich you can do with really cheap specialized
hardware (say a few thousand transistors) which would require a significant
load on an expensive general purpose chip (millions of transistors on the
current CPUs). So, it's no good deal.
Think about sound chips, modems, VGA, Serial, network chips and the like. I
don't want my CPU load go up to 0.5 because of transporting data other the
net.

The ix86 insn set is hard to support with a simple design. Actually, what
K6, PII and PIII do is to translate those insns in internal RISC like insns
which can be nicely handled by the execution units.
If you want to get rid of that much silicone, you have to dwitch
architecture and use PPC, ARM, Alpha or whatever ...
On the other hand, the x86 code is very dense, resulting in relatively short
executables.
