The problem is that your are propably using a modularized ide drivers, 
loaded by default from a initial ram disk. This has to be fixed soon, 
since in fact I was too lazy to convert my system to do this.
As a temporary solution please compile the ide core driver directly into
your kernel (which is saner anyway if you are booting from this device.)
The next round of ide patches is supposed to fix this.
