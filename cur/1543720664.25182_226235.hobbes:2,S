Hello!
I am trying to copy my old harddisk with dd to an usb disk.
On no Linux system does that work. I looks like transfering
much data from/to the usb disks stops it from using. When reconnecting
it works again.
I see this error with any usb hard disks with different cases.
Is this know to you? Can I help to debug it?
The error is attached from dmesg. 
Nico
