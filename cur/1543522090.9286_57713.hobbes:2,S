The 128MB limitation is obsolete.  You need a newer mkswap.
[andreasb@storm andreasb]$ /sbin/mkswap --version
mkswap from util-linux-2.10d
According to the man page:
The maximum useful size of a swap
area  now  depends on the architecture.  It is roughly 2GB
on i386, PPC, m68k, ARM, 1GB  on  sparc,  512MB  on  mips,
128GB on alpha and 3TB on sparc64.
