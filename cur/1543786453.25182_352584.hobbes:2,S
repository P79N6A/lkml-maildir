Isn't this still racy if another cpu drops the last reference
to task struct here? Or can't that happen?
When you said "disable preempt", I had some silly idea that this
function was only used in PREEMPT_RT mode, and that you would
simply disallow architectures without cmpxchg from configuring
PREEMPT_RT.
