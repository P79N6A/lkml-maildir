Subject: [RFC] proc fs extension for "one-value-per-file"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/5/14/91

The following patch extends the proc fs api as discussed in the thread "/proc 
format" last month (http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=98822545000007&w=2&r=1). 
It adds the following features:
- dynamic directories. Enables you to use directories for enumerations, 
similar to the per-process directories (/proc/<number>) or usbdevfs. 
- context callbacks for directories. They can do things that are common for 
all files in a directory, like locking, and are also used for dynamic 
directories.
- special functions with context support for proc files that containing short 
strings, integers or enums
These things give the proc filesystem the functionality that I need for the 
Device Registry patch to replace the XML output with the one-value-per-file 
approach. The api is documented in fs/proc/onevalue.c. 
You can download the patch for 2.4.4 here (40 kB):
