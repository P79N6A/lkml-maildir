hi,
i've been trying to get extra USB mice to work with this notebook.
unfortunately the nx6110 comes with no ps2 port so i have to use USB.
the touchpad works fine, but any USB mouse i've tried (2 different MS)
is slow and nearly unresponsive and not usable.
so i've tried different kernels.
gentoo-sources 2.6.12-r6 and r7 and vanilla 2.6.11, 2.6.11.12 and
2.6.13-rc4 behave the same (although 2.6.11 has some long timeouts
and the mouse doesn't work at all. it has some other
output with the usb stuff as seen in the attached file).
the config for the 2.6.12-r7 kernel is attached. i've searched
google and bugtracks but didn't come up with a solution yet :/
i've compiled in USB debugging, the output of different kernels is
attached (2.6.12-r7, vanilla 2.6.11.12).
output from cat /proc/bus/usb/devices on gentoo-2.6.12-r7:
T:  Bus=02 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=01 Cnt=01 Dev#=  3 Spd=1.5 MxCh= 0
D:  Ver= 1.10 Cls=00(>ifc ) Sub=00 Prot=00 MxPS= 8 #Cfgs=  1
P:  Vendor=045e ProdID=0029 Rev= 1.08
S:  Manufacturer=Microsoft

C:* #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=a0 MxPwr=100mA
I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=03(HID  ) Sub=01 Prot=02 Driver=usbhid
E:  Ad=81(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS=   4 Ivl=10ms
i tried setting 
echo 60 > /sys/module/usbhid/parameters/mousepoll
or changing the kernel boot parameter usbhid.mousepoll, but it doesn't
help.
i just fired up a knoppix cd with 2.6.11 kernel and the mouse works
fine there so there must be something wrong with my setup..??
tx for any hints,
JG
