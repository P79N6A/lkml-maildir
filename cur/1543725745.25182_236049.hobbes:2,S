What if I don't want something as heavyweight as D-BUS to handle this
for me and just want a simple parser that can tell me "this device
has x event". The kernel simply is telling user space that there
is an event and should not know/care how and by what it is handled.
Saying CORBA, D-BUS, DCOP use this naming scheme so we whould too
seems like policy to me. If I am a driver writer and I want to just 
send some state change notification, I do not want to care about such 
things. I want to be able to use a name that makes sense in the
context of the kernel and using a kobject sounds good b/c then I really
don't have to care about naming and will be less prone to errors
from typos and such. Remember, the user space deamons are not the ones 
that will actually call these functions. It is kernel code and the API
needs to be easilly useable by kernel programers.

What is the path name of a device from the kernels point of view?
Since device naming in /dev is left up to userland now, it has to
be something else that the kernel is aware of.

That sounds good, but what about a radically different approach?
What we are fundamentally trying to do is notify user space that a 
specific attribute of a specific object has had a state change. In your
example, the object is the cpu, and the attribute is "temperature". Instead 
of telling the user space daemon that the temperature is "high" (which is 
an incredibly arbitrary string), we pass the object name and attribute name 
to user space.  User space can then go read the appropriate sysfs file or take 
whatever other action is required to determine what the state change actually 
is.  In the case of a file close, the object name is the file path and the 
attribute could be the ctime, but it needs more thinking.

How is this policy? We are simply saying this subsystem in the kernel
depends on having this other subystem in the kernel. JFFS2 requires
MTD to be configured since it is layered atop that subsystem.  I think
this would be no different.
