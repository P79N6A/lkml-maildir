No, it does work, and it works very well.  The winning strategy is to
split out heavily referenced data declarations from any dependent
function declarations, and give them their own headers, also included
from the orginal headers.  The normal 'compile this header once'
mechanism makes this work smoothly and that's optimized by cpp so
compile speed impact is negigible.  In many cases only the data
declaration is needed, so it's possible we might even see a slight
speedup.
The tradeoff of a few more header files (and it's only a few) against
a lot more sanity is well worth it.  I demonstrated the technique in
my 'early_page' patch set, which lets you declare struct page as the
first thing in mm.h. and I suppose I should dust that off, update it
to 2.5 and submit it.
