Probably I am missing something, but I don't see how that can help. For
example, suppose (for simplicity) that we have swappiness of 100%, and
that fraction of referenced anon pages gets slightly less than of file
pages. get_scan_ratio() increases anon_percent, and shrink_zone() starts
scanning anon queue more aggressively. As a result, pages spend less
time there, and have less chance of ever being accessed, reducing
fraction of referenced anon pages further, and triggering further
increase in the amount of scanning, etc. Doesn't this introduce positive
feed-back loop?
Nikita.
