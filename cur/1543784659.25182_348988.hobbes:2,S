We have an infrastructure in the mid-layer for doing report lun scans.
You have a parallel one in your code.  In my book, that's duplication.

A scsi target is represented by struct scsi_target.

So you want to rehash that argument again.
Either you can do what others like FC currently do:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=110546207223304
Or you can follow the recipe you were given for making the mid-layer use
arbitrary identifiers for the target
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=112487476527470
Simply writing your own because you don't like the former and the
latter's too much work isn't acceptable.

Yes, of course, I did notice the W_LUN support which we could do with in
scsi_report_lun_scan() if you'd care to play nicely with others.

You can ask for all the features you want ... however, unless you can
persuade someone else to do the implementation, you get to write the
code yourself...

We have boatloads of devices that claim SCSI-n or SPC-n compliance then
fail in various ways.  That's what the list in scsi_devinfo.c is all
about.  I'm sure the manufacturers of those devices didn't intentionally
set out to violate the specs; however, what they actually released does.
I'm sure that SAS vendors will start out with the best of intentions
too ...

The practise of allowing Vendors to duplicate code just because they
didn't like what's in the generic subsystem or because it lacks a
feature they need hasn't been acceptable for a long time now.  Either
use what we have or fix it to do what you want.
