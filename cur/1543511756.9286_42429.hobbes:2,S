	Linux Community,
	MIcrosoft is very careful about what they say publically, and you can be assured
	that everything there is verifiable and has analyst reports to back it up.
They say that swap space is limited to 128 MB.
That is false.
It follows that *not* everything they say is verifiably true.
One would expect a collection of half-truths, but in this
case there are also outright falsehoods.
