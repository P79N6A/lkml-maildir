Well, the lack of a proper description is my fault.  I can fix this if
there is interest in actually including it.

Totally agree.  Note that it already is configurably inert, and defaults
to disabled so that might make it work for the general user just fine.
FWIW, our "debug" kernels have been running with the feature on for
quite a few weeks without problems.  But I would fully expect someone
external to want to quantify that claim on their own before it would be
considered.  So give it a whirl if you get a chance.
