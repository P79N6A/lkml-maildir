Hmmm. I just wrote an app that uses select to do essentially a "tail" 
waiting for new content in a log file. The file descriptors for real disk 
files are always ready even if there is no content available for the 
application.
The file is positioned at the end of the file after open via lseek.
select tells me that data is available but the read() returns zero bytes.
The current fix on the app level is to checking if useful work was 
done as a result of "READY" file descriptors. If the read() operations
do not return any data then the app will simply sleep for a couple of 
seconds. So the app degenerates to a kind of poll mode if disk files are 
used.
