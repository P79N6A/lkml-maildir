I compile my kernels with pgcc from over a year. And hadn't problems
caused by the compiler (i mean >2.1.xx). The kernel will be slightly
faster compared to gcc and not noticeable compared with egcs. The main
advantage of pgcc is ability to make optimized code for other CPUs like
K5, K6, Cyrix and may be for IDT chips. Here the difference can be
significant.
