Indeed. It's a "handle".
UNIX has pid's for "process" handles, and "file descriptors" for just 
about everything else.

Well, there's more there, but it really is fairly close. If you look at 
it, a "struct file" ends up not having a lot more than the minimal stuff 
required to use it as a a handle: it really isn't a very big structure. 
The biggest part is actually the read-ahead state, which is arguably a 
generic thing for a file handle, even though not all kinds will be able to 
use it. We *could* make that be behind a pointer (along with the "f_pos" 
thing, that really logically goes along with the read-ahead thing), of 
course, but since most files probably do end up being "traditional file" 
structures, it's probably not wrong to just have it in the file.

Well, since a lot of the interfaces harken back to "select()", we really 
are stuck with basically a couple of bits total (poll extends on the 
number of bits, but not a whole lot). So right now we have just "an event 
happened", and if you want to know more, you do need to do a read() or 
similar. That's true of all the traditional file descriptors too, of 
course.

Well, since the interfaces for that already exists, I'm certainly not 
going to disagree.

Well, the setitimer ones do not really make sense for a timer that isn't 
directly associated with one particular process. Once it's associated with 
a file descriptor, it really isn't bound to any particular execution 
context, and as such, virtual and profiling timers really don't make any 
sense any more!
The only thing that exists outside of an execution context is really just 
"relative" and "absolute". Of course, you could still specify just what 
you want your timers to be based on (ie the "realtime" vs "monotonic" 
thing), and possibly the resolution, but it really does boil down to just 
those two choices (and the rest is just confusion).
So I really don't think you lose a lot by just limiting it to "real time" 
vs "relative time". Those really *are* the choices.
