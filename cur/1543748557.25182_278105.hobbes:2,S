lt001.18RT/lt.02 is such a trace. It starts on CPU#1:
 <unknown-3556  1...1    0µs : find_next_bit (user_trace_start)
and ends on CPU#0:
 <unknown-3556  1...1  247µs : _raw_spin_lock_irqsave (user_trace_stop)
the trace shows a typical migration of an RT task.
(but ... i have to say the debugging overhead is horrible. Please try a
completely-non-debug-non-tracing kernel just to see the difference.)
