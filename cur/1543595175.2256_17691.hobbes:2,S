The point was that Stimits says that on its Red Hat 7.1 he has no
ldscripts directory, and so no files like elf_i386.x and so on.
I was just surprised, since i know thay are all necessary to /usr/bin/ld
to work.
Then he was alo wondering why he has
two libc
/lib/libc.so.6 and /lib/i686/libc.so.6, one is tripped and the other
contains debug symbols.
I can figure why, but he adfirms that /lib/i686 is not included in
/etc/ld.so.conf, there is no preload configured, but this is the directory
used by the loader to find the libc to load.
I have to red hat installed, so i was trying to figure out how things are
working on new releases (my last red hat was 6.2 when i was working at red
hat Italy).
