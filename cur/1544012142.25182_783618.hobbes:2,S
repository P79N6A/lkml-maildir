These all are just slightly different variations - with this one you'd 
have to scan dma channels in your dma irq handler, which I currently don't 
have to do.

I think the version with a lookup table is optimal - it uses standard 
mechanisms for irq handling and doesn't waste RAM. The disadvantage - 
every addition will need driver modification...
But ok, this is taking way too long. Just tell me which way you'd like to 
have it and I'll do it.
