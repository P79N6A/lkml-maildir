No, in fact, the user will almost always want to see the signal
handler.  The GDB user experience is dramatically worse when signal
handlers execute without any sign to the user; single steps can appear
to leave you absolutely anywhere, esp. if the signal handler longjumps
or hits a breakpoint.
You can see this by using GDB on MIPS or ARM, where it does not use
PTRACE_SINGLESTEP.
If your application wants to skip the signal handler, you will have to
use a breakpoint to do so.
I don't know what previous version of the kernel you are referring to. 
This behavior is not new.

Yes.  That's three context switches instead of one; if you are using a
local debug agent, then this is not a big deal.  If you are using a
simplistic remote debug agent, then you need to teach the agent when to
do this automatically.

An incompatible change.  No.

ptrace options are for asynchronous behaviors.  This is a synchronous
behavior; if it is worth implementing at all it should be an action,
not an option.

First of all we already have an event message facility,
PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG.  Secondly the only way we will step into a signal
handler after PTRACE_SINGLESTEP is if the PTRACE_SINGLESTEP requests
a signal.  That was your application; keep track of it in your
application.

You didn't say what kernel you were using.  I believe this was fixed
some time ago.
