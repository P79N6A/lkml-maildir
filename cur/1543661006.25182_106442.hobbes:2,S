No, any b_data < PAGE_OFFSET is not wrong, that's the point. For highmem
b_page, b_data will be the offset into the page. So it could be 2048,
for instance.
The test is meant to catch an invalid buffer_head, where b_page is not
set but b_data isn't valid either. So to make it complete, you could do:
	if (bh->b_page) {
		...
		if (bh->b_data >= PAGE_SIZE)
			BUG();
	} else {
		...
		if (bh->b_data < PAGE_SIZE)
			BUG();
		if (bh->b_data < PAGE_OFFSET)
			BUG();
	}
as they are two different bugs.
