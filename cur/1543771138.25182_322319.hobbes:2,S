This is a touchy topic, and I can see this thread turning into the mother
of all LKML threads with lots of unproductivity on this issue alone ...
Assuming we're talking about the same patent (US5,995,745) the best thing
one can do to understand is read the actual patent claims. There are two
root claims in the patent (1 & 7) and they both start with:
>> A process for running a general purpose computer operating system
>> using a real time operating system, including the steps of:
>>
>> a) providing a real time operating system for running real time
>> tasks and components and non-real time tasks;
>>
>> b) providing a general purpose operating system as one of the

In my unlawyerly opinion, neither a nanokernel/hypervisor nor PREEMPT_RT
could possibly be interpreted as doing what is claimed above.
