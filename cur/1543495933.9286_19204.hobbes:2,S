Why not just use the existing support built into the cdrom
driver?  Just plop in a CDRW, and mount it.  Nothing special need
be done.

It allready does that, and has done so for ages.  If you can read
a CD, or a CDR on your drive, and if the drive is CDRW multiread
compliant, then you can mount a CDRW just like any other disk.
If you've burned the CDRW in Windows95/98 however with
proprietary software such as Adaptec DirectCD, you are
practically shit out of luck because it uses the UDF filesystem
which is not supported in Linux as of yet.  There is a project
out there to add such support, but I gave up following their
progress and decided to just avoid using UDF disks.
Burn your CDR's and CDRW's with iso9660 filesystems, and all will
be well.

Check of "Enable Experimental Drivers" in the menuconfig, then
enable "NTFS write mode" in filesystems.  It is dangerous
however, so use at own risk.
>And now for the big question:

From what I remember, Linus uses RedHat, and likely a highly
customized version considering who he is - and even I have mine
heavily customized, so I can imagine what his looks like.  ;o)
>If he has his own dist. would he release it to the rest of us?
He doesn't, and likely isn't interested in such high-level
things.  If he were, he'd likely release it.  Maintaining a
distribution takes many people, and lots of time.
