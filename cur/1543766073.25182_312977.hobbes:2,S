 Yes, you're right.  My point was that that's scsi_run_queue()'s
business.  We don't need to comment that deep when we're requeueing a
request.  After we put a request on a queue, we kick the queue.  It's
the queue running function's responsibility to determine whether to run
the request right away or to defer processing (and thus plug).  I wasn't
saying that the eventual plugging isn't necessary, but that the comment
is sort of excessive.
 Anyways, if you think the comment is necessary, I don't feel strong
against it.  I'll rewrite above comment to fit the new code and repost
this patch soon.
