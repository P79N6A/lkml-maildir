If the per-cpu caches are enabled on UP, too, then this is a moot point: 
by the time a batch is freed from the per-cpu array, it will be cache cold.
And btw, why do you think a page is cache-warm when the last object on a 
  page is freed? If the last 32-byte kmalloc is released on a page, 40xx 
bytes are probably cache-cold.
Back to your first problem: You've mentioned excess hits on the 
cache_chain_semaphore. Which app did you use for stress testing? Could 
you run a stress test with the applied patch?
I've tried dbench 50, with 128 MB RAM, on uniprocessor, with 2.4:
There were 9100 calls to kmem_cache_reap, and in 90% of the calls, no 
freeable memory was found. Alltogether, only 1300 pages were freed from 
the slabs.
Are there just too many calls to kmem_cache_reap()? Perhaps we should 
try to optimize the "nothing freeable exists" logic?
