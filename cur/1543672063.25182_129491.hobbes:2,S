Post this to where it belongs, the linux-net and netdev
lists.
This is occuring far too frequently, and I'll be damned if I'm
going to be required to read each and every linux-kernel posting
to catch all of the networking patches.
Therefore, from now on I'm going to flat out ignore every
networking patch that is sent to lkml and isn't at least CC:'d to
linux-net, netdev, or the listed networking maintainers.  I mean
what the heck is the purpose of the MAINTAINERS entry if people
don't even use it?
