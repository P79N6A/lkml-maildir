Ah, I know this one ...
UTF-16 is like UCS-2 except that it has escapes to let you use past the
first plane of Unicode.  That is, by and large it's 2-bytes long, but
sometimes it can be 4 or more bytes long.  How to convert?  Let's see ...
	for (i = 0, j = 0; i < (name_size/sizeof(name_unicode[0])); i++) {
		unsigned int rune = name_unicode[i];
		if (0xD7FF < rune && rune < 0xE000) {
			rune = (rune & 0x7ff) << 10;
			rune |= name_unicode[++i] & 0x3ff;
		}
		if (rune < 0x80) {
			name_utf8[j++] = rune;
		} else if (rune < 0x800) {
			name_utf8[j++] = 0xc0 | (rune >> 6);
			name_utf8[j++] = 0x80 | (rune & 0x3f);
		} else if (rune < 0x10000) {
			name_utf8[j++] = 0xe0 | (rune >> 12);
			name_utf8[j++] = 0x80 | ((rune >> 6) & 0x3f);
			name_utf8[j++] = 0x80 | (rune & 0x3f);
		} else {
			name_utf8[j++] = 0xf0 | (rune >> 18);
			name_utf8[j++] = 0x80 | ((rune >> 12) & 0x3f);
			name_utf8[j++] = 0x80 | ((rune >> 6) & 0x3f);
			name_utf8[j++] = 0x80 | (rune & 0x3f);
		}
	}

Haven't even tried to compile it ...

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
