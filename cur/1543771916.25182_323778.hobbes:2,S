i'd not have done it differently :) The most important bits are the 
entry.S changes: to correctly update bit-tests to mask-tests and to 
extend any byte-test to a word-test (because bit 9 falls outside of the 
low byte) - you've done that all correctly. I've applied your patch and 
have uploaded the -47-28 release. Boots fine on my x64 box too.
