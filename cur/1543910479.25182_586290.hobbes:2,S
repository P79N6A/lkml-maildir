account_system_time() is called by the scheduler on tick. If we clear PF_VCPU in
kvm_guest_exit(), the flag is always cleared when account_system_time() is
executed, so we account "0", if we call account_system_time() directly from
kvm_guest_exit() we account "1", so we subtract 1 to system time, and we have
perhaps not used 1 tick in system: in my opinion this implies wrong results.
