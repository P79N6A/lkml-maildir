I'd rather not revert the whole PCI assign thing, because it's good.
But disabling the ROM assignment might be a good idea. Almost nobody ever 
really wants to assign the ROM anyway, and there are cards where there are 
some strange rules about ROM alignment (read: doesn't follow spec).
That may be the problem with MGA - I think some gfx cards used the same
decoder for ROM and for the video RAM aperture, so that you were supposed
to only enable ROM when the RAM thing was quiescent or something, and 
always use the same address too (the current code doesn't _enable_ the 
ROM, but I think it allocates and programs the base address. Which 
should be harmless, but..).
Ivan? Does something like this make a difference?
