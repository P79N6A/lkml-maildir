I've got a lot of responses to this.  Any companies out there who have
job postings and the need for some talented networking engineers in
Utah, please send us the info so we can post it on our website.  If
there's Linux work, these guys can do what we did, and learn Linux and
work on that.
Send the info to jobs@timpanogas.com and I'll post the job listings on
our website.
Jeff
