Jon does your emulator sit on top of the new legacy I/O and memory APIs?  I 
added them for this very reason, though atm only ia64 supports them.  There's 
documentation in Documentation/filesystems/sysfs-pci.txt if you want to take 
a look.  On kernels that support it, sysfs can be a one stop shop for all 
your gfx programming needs, since it provides access to the rom, PCI 
resources (i.e. MMIO ranges, fb memory, etc.) and legacy I/O ports and 
memory.
