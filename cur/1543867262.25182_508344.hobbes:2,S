I don't believe there is a NULL pgdat. The code for memory less nodes in
ia64 discontig.c allocates the memory less nodes pgdat from the best
memory node candidate. If there is a NULL pgdat, then it's a bug. Instead
for memory less nodes you don't have any present pages. 
I thought the bug was because the process wanted to bind on just one
memoryless node and MPOL_BIND didn't handle that correctly and return
an error to the process.
