Not sure I agree.  What if we are using a private namespace for a
vserver, and then we want to create a private namespace in there for a
mobile application.  Since we're talking about nested namespaces, this
should be possible.
Now I believe Eric's code so far would make it so that you can only
refer to a namespace from it's *creating* context.  Still restrictive,
but seems acceptable.
(right?)
