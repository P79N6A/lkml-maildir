Should we try to get rid of all those silly:
#include <asm-generic/foo.h>
files we have in arch/$ARCH/include/asm?
We could for example add include/generic/ last in the search path.
Or we could add the files in include/asm and add that last in the
search path.
Then if we do not find <asm/foo.h> in arch/$ARCH/include/asm/
then we search include/asm.
Before we can do this we need to get rid of the last users of
include/asm-$ARCH - but we are almost there.
Only m68k seems to require some effort.
