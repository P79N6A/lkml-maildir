Eh, that is not the case for some ATM.
Do "migration", "ksoftirqd", "watchdog", "events", "kblockd" and "aio" map 
to a particular device besides possibly "CPU"?
"xfslogd", "xfsdatad", and "rpciod" also have one thread per CPU rather 
than per-device or per-mount.
"pdflush" even has a variable number of threads running, depending on load. 
One thread may serve many mounts/devices, or - I have seen this - eight 
instances manage two mounts.
