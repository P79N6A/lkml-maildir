i installed 2.4.0 last week and all worked well on my amd-K6-350
i use a cheap sound card since 2.0.36 and it always worked well too.
it work well now in 2.4.0, BUT , /dev/sndstat report me <no such file or
directory>
and /proc/sound (as noted in documentation) does not exist...
the sound work well, but i cant verify the existence of the driver with
sndstat anymore
could someone tell me if i should have done some additionnal
configuration to see
appear the /proc/sound or to enable /dev/sndstat...
maybe is it another method now in 2.4 to see the sound status...
Best Wishes to all of you for the new year...
