I believe it's in memory management, and in particular
buffer handling.
Once there are enough dirty disk buffers, the I/O queue
is clogged up and pages from the disk cache are stolen,
including executable pages and important program data.
Something seems to have changed between 2.2.0 and 2.2.1
because the normal/buffer/cache ratio is different on
these two kernels. I haven't had time to investigate this
more, though :(
