Oh right, so there's still a hole there. The above logic foolishly
thinks that if i == nr_pages, they must be contig. But I can see that
may not be the case. Additionally, I need to init pages[] from i and
forward, since we may be looking at that in the loop.

Agree, that should be sound. I'll adjust the code.

do_splice_to() checks that, should I move that checking further down in
case the file is truncated?

I'll look into readahead.
