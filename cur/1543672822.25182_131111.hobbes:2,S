Hi all,
I have discovered that recently I can no longer attach via strace to 
already running processes for a long time. Specifically I have a daemon which
sleeps in select and periodically wakes up from SIGALRM signals. As soon as a
signal hits, strace quits on 2.5.69, however, it works fine on 2.4.21-rc.
Can someone shed some light on what's going on?
root@Corona:~> strace -p 527
--- SIGSTOP (Stopped (signal)) ---
--- SIGSTOP (Stopped (signal)) ---
select(7, [0 3 6], [], NULL, NULL)      = ? ERESTARTNOHAND (To be restarted)
--- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) ---
root@Corona:~> echo $?
0
-Udo.
