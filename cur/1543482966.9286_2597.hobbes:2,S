Thanks for your responses !
To fill in the blanks :
I've been using Slackware.
I updated with REDHAT 
(because I had to buy a new Video-card); 
But I had a CD problem with the REDHAT.
So, I swung to CALDERA 
-which is too simple
(it won't Install on my Advansys SCSI).
Finally, I think I'll return the CALDERA, 
and try the REDHAT again.
