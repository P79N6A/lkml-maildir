Agreed; that whole bit which mentions other filesystem comparisons
should probably be stricken, unless it can be
proven/demonstrated/substantiated that ext3 really does "offer higher
data integrity guarantees than most" at this point.
data=ordered ensures that stale data won't be exposed on a crash; xfs
won't do this (it'd be a security bug) and I'd be surprised if jfs or
reiserfs do either.    And it probably *should* be mentioned that
data=writeback bears this risk.
And until ext3 turns on barriers by default, I don't think it's fair to
talk too much about integrity guarantees.  :)
