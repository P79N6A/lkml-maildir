Well, if you are going to reply to me, you really should c.c. me.
I am beginning to understand that you are really just a troll looking
for trouble. However I will, again try to be nice and show you the
errors of your ways.

I have read the message.
Of course, you didn't bother to fix your mailer as advised so you
didn't read my message either.

Now, let me get this straight; "I want something that abstracts away most
of the low-level items...." Damn! I want a Learjet!  As I said, if you
want one, you make one and, as I stated before it isn't as easy as you
seem to think and I think you have proven that you are not too well
learned about kernel modules and configuration items when you want to.
I quote; "abstract away most of the lower level items..."

No. You are discussing a personal preference. Like I said, if you don't
like it, you make a new one. It's just that simple. Once you start
looking into what it takes to configure a kernel, if you have any
smarts at all, you will have some second thoughts about this.

Drivers write the messages that the driver authors wanted them to write.
The kernel "state" at that time was that the driver was called. If you
have a problem with a specific driver message, you contact the author
and suggest something. The kernel only writes the messages that some
module author wanted. It tries to get the message out, even if the
kernel is very sick.

You got no knee-jerk flaming from me. If you think you did, you are in a
world of hurt.
