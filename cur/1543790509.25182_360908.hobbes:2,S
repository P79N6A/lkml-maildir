As previously stated: with this patch, compiling in support for the
NSLU2 will make the timer tick base right for the NSLU2 but wrong
for everything else.
There are two ways of dealing with this problem:
1/ The patch you sent, plus some config hacks to make it impossible
   to compile in NSLU2 support together with support for another ixp4xx
   machine type that has FREQ=66666666, sidestepping the issue; or
2/ Make the ixp4xx timer tick base runtime selectable altogether, for
   example with the patch that I sent to linux-arm-kernel a while ago.
I'm not very much in favor of 1/, but at least it's better than not
having any kind of protection at all.  If you leave it to the user,
they simply _are_ going to get it messed up.
