Hello!?!  McFly!?!  Yes, the networking changes that have just gone in
broke all the network drivers.  Now let's see, vmnet is part of vmware, a
product you have presumable paid for.  Hmmm, in addition, it is neither
part of the main kernel distribution, nor is it maintained by the folks on
linux-kernel.  So, please explain to me why you sent this message to the
mailing list when it clearly should've gone to support@vmware.com?
