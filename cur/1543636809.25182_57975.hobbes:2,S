Well you don't necessarily have to be an IDE guru to realize something's
wrong when you see a bloke constantly breaking the subsystem, practically
never fixing it up himself, disappearing for a month w/o saying a word
after having fried 2.5.25 completely and not really caring about what
others have to say about the code.
And you've noticed the IDE 2.4 forward-port, right?
