OK.

I'd like PG_booked to go away too - I don't think we've put that under the
microscope yet.  If it remains then its scope will be "defined by the
filesystem", so readahead shouldn't use it.  PG_reclaim belongs to core VFS
so that's much better.
Let's not do anything ugly, slow or silly in there, but please do take a
look, see if there is an opportunity here.
