I would suggest that the init time table is infinitely saner, but if
there will be compiler generated instructions that are hard to catch, do
both: init time fixups for the __asm__ statements, and run time for
compiler generated instructions.
You really want the init time fixups anyway, because a really _really_
obvious optimisation is to remove `lock' prefixes on UP.
