The patches from this push fix suspend on the Toshiba Portege R500, but
resume from hibernation is still broken.  It works in the minimal configuration
(init=/bin/bash) 100% of the time.  It also sort of works from the console, but
then the second attempt to hibernate fails because some tasks cannot be
frozen.
2.6.27.7 hibernates and resumes on the same box 100% of the time, from X too.
I'll carry out bisection in the next few days.
Thanks,
