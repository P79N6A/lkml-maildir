Subject: improved wait_8254_wraparound()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

hopefully 'better' fix for broken Intel Mercury/Neptune in
wait_8254_wraparound() ...
Rationale:
changing HZ to higher values (like 5k,10k or 20k) will hang
machines using wait_8254_wraparound() indefinitely, because
a suboptimal workaround for buggy Intel Mercury/Neptune 
chipsets is in place.
this was tested on several machines, unfortunately none
with a broken Intel Mercury/Neptune chipset, and it works
fine with various HZ values ...
please consider for inclusion or further testing ...
TIA,
Herbert
