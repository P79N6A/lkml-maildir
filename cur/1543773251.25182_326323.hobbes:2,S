Maybe I missed it, but was there ever a conclusive discussion about the 
perfomance impact this has?
I see lots of new u64 variables. I'm especially interested how this code 
scales down to small and slow machines, where such a precision is absolute 
overkill. How do these patches change current and possibly common time 
operations?
bye, Roman
