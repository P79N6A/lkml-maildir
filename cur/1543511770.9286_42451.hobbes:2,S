Bzzzt.  Unless Debian has changed something recently, their shipped kernel
source doesn't include the config and version information require to
seamlessly build modules out of the box.  For cases when a driver has to
ship separately from the kernel, this means they have to go out and
properly configure, compile and install the kernel, and know what they're
doing in order to use the driver.  This is too much to expect from every
single new user.
