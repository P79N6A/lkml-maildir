Self Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology, it allows drives to report reliability statistics.
Smartmontools includes a utility, 'smartctl', you may already have it installed.  If so:
smartctl -e /dev/hda <- Enable S.M.A.R.T.
smartctl -a /dev/hda <- Dump all data
might provide useful data.
John.
