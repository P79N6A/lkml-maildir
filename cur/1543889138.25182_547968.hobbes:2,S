We can't very much know if the kernel is really buggy, then.  I'd say we
need a report from someone with another thinkpad that uses the 1R BIOS that
has an up-to-date BIOS, to know for sure.  Since that includes the T41 and
T42, chances are others would have spoken up about it already if it affected
the more recent versions of the 1R BIOS.
