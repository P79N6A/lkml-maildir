Ehh, I was under the impression he was benchmarking kernels compiled
WITH these compilers, using contest?
Your post seems to imply he was using the compilers as the benchmark. 
If so, I retract my previous post - I know gcc 3.x is slow as puke.  I
think, however, he is comparing the resulting kernels, in which case
there is a serious issue at hand...
