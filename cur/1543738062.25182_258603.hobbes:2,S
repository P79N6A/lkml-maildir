As of at least kernel version 2.6.9-rc2 I pretty often see the kernel
hang after returning from sleep mode hanging with the message "adb:
starting with probe task". This still happens with 2.6.9-rc3 but never
happened with 2.6.8.1.
Thats what is on the screen when it hangs (no more possible to enter
xmon):
