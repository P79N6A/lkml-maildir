Hey Ben,
	I appreciate your looking over my patch. You are correct, the
conversion is a bit rough and I've not yet been able to work on the
powerpc vDSO, although I'd like to get it working so any help or
suggestions would be appreciated (is there a reason the vDSO is written
in ASM?).
If you have any other concerns w/ that patch, or the generic timekeeping
code, please let me know and I'll do what I can to address them.
thanks
