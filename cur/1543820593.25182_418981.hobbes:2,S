Subject: [PATCH] drivers/scsi : Fix proc_scsi_write to return "length" on success with remove-single-device case
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
proc_scsi_write doesn't return the "length" upon successfully removing a 
device; instead it returns 0. This causes commands like "echo" to redo 
the write(), which ends up in something like,
$ echo "scsi remove-single-device 0 0 3 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
"-bash: echo: write error: No such device or address"
, eventhough the device was removed.
Attached here is a patch to fix the issue.
* Fix proc_scsi_write to return "length" in remove-single-device case.
