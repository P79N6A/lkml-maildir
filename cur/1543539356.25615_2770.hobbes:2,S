Whenever I trick the kernel to think that I'm Accessing something as
root, I have instant permanent Root-access. Wether I can write to ONE
disk block (which happens to contain the inode of the copy of /bin/sh
that I have prepared in my homedir) or I can change the "current->uid"
in main memory. 
Whenever I trick the kernel into thinking I'm root for an instant,
that can be leveraged to "permanent root" and/or a wipe of the disk. 
I hope that "sending raw packets to the disk" is a priviledged
operation, and not something that simply depends on the permissions on 
the disk device?
