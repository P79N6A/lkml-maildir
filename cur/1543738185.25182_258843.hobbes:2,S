It depends on how often the second check fails.
The 99.9+% case is that the checksum is good, and in that case, you have
to pay the wakeup cost anyway.  (So sending bad-checksum packets isn't
even a useful DoS; good-checksum packets still steal more cycles.)
You only get the benefit of saving the wakeup if the check fails.
But every time it passes, you get the benefit of making the check cheaper.
You have to multiply by the relative probabilities to see the net effect.
For something like UDP checksums on packets which have already passed the
ethernet checksum, that's a pretty overwhelming ratio.
