I noticed that X11 became teribly slow on screen updates using 2.4.3-ac11 on
an asus a7v133 (via686b).
Before that I ran an a7v (via686a): using ac6 worked
fine with X. X on ac9 also works fine, at least I did not notice any slowdown.
Unfortunately cannot test ac11 on the a7v anymore...
I thought ac9 does include the via workarounds.  Is there a significant
diff between ac9 and ac11, or between via686a and 686b to cause this?
