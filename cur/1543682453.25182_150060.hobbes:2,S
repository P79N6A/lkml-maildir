I have 2.6.0-test1 running on my AS 1000A/333:
[oliver@track oliver]$ rpm -q modutils kernel gcc binutils
modutils-2.4.21-18
kernel-2.6.0test1-6
gcc-3.1-6
binutils-2.12.90.0.7-3
Please note, that I have build the kernel rpm myself by using 'make rpm' and
YES, I did configure it before using 'make menuconfig'. :)
Best regards,
 Oliver
