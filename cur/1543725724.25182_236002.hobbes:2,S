except we don't (usually) have daemons listening for printk strings
and doing something very specific based upon them such as scanning new
media

by guess is most driver errors will belong to a small common subset

all the more reason why they should be placed somewhere non-trivial so
we can discuss what exactly is required and suitable on a case-by-case
