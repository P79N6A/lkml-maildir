Hello,
I believe that there is a bug in the usb-storage code. I'm using
2.6.0-test8-mm1, but I have experienced this in essentially all
2.6.0-test* kernels. Mostly anytime when I remove a usb-storage device
(especially before umounting it), I get a SEGV followed by general
unstability in the SCSI subsys.
After doing some research, I believe it is because the I/O scheduler
is released before the SCSI subsys stops using it. Here is the SEGV
report:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000001
 printing eip:

Code:  Bad EIP value.
It seems as if the elevator_exit_fn is set to 1, and there is a
message logged just before the SEGV report spits out that an I/O
scheduler is released, which makes me draw the conclusion that the
kernel tries to free the I/O scheduler twice.
My apologies for taking up your time if this is a known a fixed
problem. However, if it is, can you point me to some information on
how to remedy it?
If it isn't, please tell me how I can help fix this.
Also, between the message that indicates that the I/O scheduler has
been released and the SEGV, there are two messages from the hotplug
handler, indicating that it can't the agents for "block" and "scsi"
(in that order), if that helps you determine the order of
things. There is also another message of the same kind for "block"
just before the I/O scheduler is first released.
Thank you for your time!
Fredrik Tolf
