It (a) allows the console user access to devices "related to" the console 
(if only by proximity, i.e. floppy drives) and (b) insures the devices have 
"secure" permissions at all times (except when explicitly overridden by the 
console user during a specific console login session).  (b) is where it 
defines system policy, in that it specifies the explicit ownership and 
permissions the devices revert to upon logout.
It probably wouldn't qualify as something similar to devfsd's policy table 
if, instead of specifying default ownerships and permissions, it restored 
the ownerships and permissions in effect before the console session.  But 
because it does specify those explicitl ownerships and permissions, you have 
to edit /etc/security/console.perms to have a lasting effect on permissions 
of devices "controlled" by pam_console.

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
