So the problems IA64 had with this are resolved now? 
Unfortunately there is a perfmon for i386/x86-64 implementation
floating around now (with some unmergeable stuff but might be fixable) 
which is kind of competing now :/

Has there been actually any serious review on this? 
Last time I looked there was a lot of very ugly code in there.
Also I'm not sure things like comming with an own profiler
and spinlock debugger are really acceptable. At least this stuff
should be removed too.
