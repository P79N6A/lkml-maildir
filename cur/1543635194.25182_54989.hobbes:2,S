[I reported this to a maintainer awhile ago, but I just
tried 2.5.25 and noticed I needed to fix things again,
so I'm trying here.]
These files
	drivers/net/wireless/airo.c
	drivers/net/aironet4500.h
need to have
	#include <linux/tqueue.h>
added to them.
It seems to work fine with this modification.
