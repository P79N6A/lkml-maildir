Because the issue keeps coming up. More specifically the issue came 
up again this time around not because of proprietry drivers, but 
because binary portable modules make sense. And I didn't bring it up 
again.

Ok. I was interested in starting work on such a project, so to scope 
out whether it would be worthwhile, I asked Alan and Linus how they 
felt about this type of thing. I got my answer, so I didn't start 
working on it.
However others believe the same things that I do, so I felt it 
necesary to bring these issues up again. At least so they will be on 
record further down the track.

Alan believe there is no problem. Yet lots of people (software 
developers and hardware vendors alike) tell me via private email that 
they agree entirely with what I am saying. Yet they seem to be too 
scared to bring this up in public, because the Linux kernel 
developers have a long history of shooting down very good, well 
designed ideas because *they* don't agree with it.
Witness the KGI/GGI debacle.
Nuf said.
