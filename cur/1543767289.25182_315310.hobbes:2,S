To me it looks like an atrocious hack that works only because of the
way the implementation is done and not really by design.  A well
defined interface where you want to do is explicitely said is way less
annoying long term.  I don't know what the right approach would be
(join <ns> vs. exec in <ns> vs. clone in <ns>) or even what a
namespace reference should look like (fd, pid, something else), and
probably only Al has a good idea of that.  Al, you've been quite
silent here.  What do you think the right method/interface would be to
start an interactive shell in a pre-existing different namespace?
