I can't wait for your pv block driver :)
What do you think is missing?  My list has:
- registration of hypercall handlers from modules
- execution of hypercall handlers outside vcpu_load() (so they are 
preemptible and sleepable)
- passing unhandled hypercalls to userspace for qemu-based devices
Please do post the patches to kvm-devel, even if they aren't ready, so 
we can get a taste of what's coming.
