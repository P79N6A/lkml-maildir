Well, you should read the preceding messages to understand how we got
here.
Andi had some reservations and I tend to agree. The current heuristic
assumes specific TCP behaviour, which is left as an implementation issue
in specifications. Conclusion: it works if you're lucky.
But it's true I can't show you any data to the contrary, either. This is
not the issue that started this thread.

I don't think I missed that point.

When you say "reliably", you should recognize the underlying assumptions
as well.
