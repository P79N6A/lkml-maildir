day-ja-vu!
Andrew, this discussion came up back when Ingo and Arjan introduced
WARN_ON_ONCE. Well, not exactly.  I'm sorry, but I missed what was wrong
with the current way of doing WARN_ON_ONCE?
Anyway, what's the advantage of testing a variable that is most likely
will be true, and that you will need to test the condition *anyway*.
Even if the __warn_once is in cache, it may be pushing something out of
a register, to read the variable and test it. And after all that we test
the condition too, with no savings.
Is this patch to get rid of the int ret=0?  Doesn't the compiler
optimize that out?
Here's my comment when I sent the patch to change the original:
  if (unlikely(__warn_once && (condition)))
to 
  if (unlikely((condition) && __warn_once)))
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=114935833125957&w=2
That was different, since we were putting a likely condition in an
unlikely(). But I still don't see why we would ever want to test
__warn_once before the condition, since it doesn't save on anything and
just adds extra work.  I don't see the savings.
