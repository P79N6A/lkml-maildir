Well after patch2, G5 fork is 3% and exec is 1%, I'd say the P4
numbers will be improved as well with that patch. Then if we have
specific lock/unlock bitops, I hope it should reduce that further.
The overhead that is there should just be coming from the extra
overhead in the file backed fault handler. For noop fork/execs,
I think that tends to be more pronounced, it is hard to see any
difference on any non-micro benchmark.
The other thing is that I think there could be some cache effects
happening -- for example the exec numbers on the 2nd line are
disproportionately large.
It definitely isn't a good thing to drop performance anywhere
though, so I'll keep looking for improvements.
