Agreed. We have some useful tools for this.

If this turns out to be true, I see it as pretty sad commentary on the
state of the kernel. If its sprinkled all over with random hacks that
cause it to avoid a return to user space for inordinate amounts of
time, that doesn't seem to be a much better situation than the one in
which there are a bunch of random hacks that seek to reverse it.
