Hah. My "abuse every gcc feature and do really ugly macros" dark side has 
been vetted, and it came up with the appended work of art.
Doing a "break" inside a conditional by using the gcc statement 
expressions is sublime. 
And it works. It's a couple of instructions longer than the shortest 
version (but still about half the size of the horror we have now), but the 
instructions are simpler (just a shift rather than a "btl"), and it now 
knows to break out early if there are no CPU's left to check.
It has the added advantage that because it uses simpler core instructions, 
gcc can actually optimize it better - in "nr_context_switches()" gcc 
happily hoisted the "mask->bits[0]" load to outside the loop, for example.
With NR_CPUS==2, gcc even apparently unrolls the loop, to the point where 
it isn't even a loop at all. Good boy (at least for that case - I sure 
hope it won't do that for some of the larger loops ;).
Of course, I shouldn't say "works", since it is still totally untested. It 
_looks_ good, and that statement expression usage is just _so_ ugly it's 
cute.
