In the worst case it won't wipe out my machine. The machine could go OOM
yes, but I'd like more to have the machine overloaded than not see what's
going to happen. And if your tcpdump will get an OOM segfault it won't
make difference because you are just going to lose data so better a
complete break than an hided lose frame. This mean you'll do everything
possible until you'll be OOM. I like this way here. I use tcpdump for
debugging and I _don't_ want to ask myself if for some unliky reason a
packet got dropped from the receivce queue or see strange things like it
was happening here with the loopback device.
Another approch could be to simply enlarge the default rcv_buf to a custom
value (via a new packet-ioctl), but it's a less generic according to me
(even if very more confortable than your copy to userspace tcpdump buffer
when rmemalloc > rcvbuf, the good point of your approch is that the first
part of the userspace buffer could go to swap).
Comments?

PS. just to complete my patches here is the SOCK_RAW change that follow my
way ;).
