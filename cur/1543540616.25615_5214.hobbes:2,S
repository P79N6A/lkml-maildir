Hi,
One thing to remember.
Working limits are lowered due to not running kswapd until ALL
zones have zone_wake_kswapd.
Maybe limits need to be refined (linux/mm/page_alloc.c)
also included in this patch is a patch to printout status
of zones.
This has lead me to the conclusion that kswapd can't be made
to handle the most intensive loads. It is easy force yourself
into a situation where both zone_wake_kswapd and low_on_memory
are set for all zones...
