Except that this isn't sanely possible on Linux right now.
We only have per-process limits, so you should have enough
memory to support [size limit] X [# processes limit] for
the user.
Because of Netscape, the size limit would have to be 20MB or more
The number of processes would have to be something like 60 in order
to support gnome + kernel build + some other stuff.
That's a quota of 1.2 _GB_ per user, which is not at all reasonable.
Overcommit does make sense in this case and the risk of running out
of memory every once in a while are well worth the 1.1GB space
savings ;)
regards,
Rik
