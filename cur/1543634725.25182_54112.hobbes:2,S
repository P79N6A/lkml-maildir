- please take a look at Documentation/CodingStyle
- if pci_set_dma_mask() fails, the driver shouldn't go on as if nothing 
  happened. See what other drivers do (net/acenic.c for example)
- the interesting part of DMA mapping conversion is more a matter of
  memory descriptor handling (and phys_to_virt/friends removal)
