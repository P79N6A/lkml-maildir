Assume following
  - the usar can tell "which process should be killed at first"
What is the difference between oom_adj and this cgroup to users ?
If oom_adj is hard to use, making it simpler is a good way, I think.
rather than adding new complication.
It seems both of oom_adj and this cgroup will be hard-to-use functions
for usual system administrators. But no better idea than using memcg
and committing memory usage.
