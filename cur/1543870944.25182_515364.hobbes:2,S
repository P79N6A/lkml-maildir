I have had problems with cable detection on my previous laptop and my 
current laptop. It almost made
my systems unusable. On my current laptop I was getting a thruput of a 
little over 1 mbps instead
of the 44 mbps I get with udma set to the correct value. It took hours 
to upgrade my laptop from
fc5 to fc6 because of this mis detection.
