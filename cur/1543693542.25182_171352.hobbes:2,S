I don't mind it per se, but I don't much see the point either. 
handle_irq() is pretty timing-critical, so we should keep it as fast as 
humanly possible. In contrast, all the other paths that care about 
IRQ_INPROGRESS are _not_ generally timing-critical, which is why I'd 
rather have them do the extra work.
In particular, in this case the only other path that seems to care would 
be "disable_irq()", which does indeed care (well "request_irq()" also 
cares, but request_irq() already clears the bit).

I agree that we don't need to set it. It's more of a streamlining 
question.
For 2.4.x it might also be a question of "which patch is smaller"  
(conceptually and in practice). I think they end up being exactly the same
in this case.

The BIOS defines irq 0 in the PCI config space to be "no irq" as far as I
know, and on all PC platforms I've ever heard of it's not a usable irq for
generic PCI devices (it's wired to the timer thing). 
All PCI routing chipsets I know about also make "irq0" mean "disabled". 
Which is not to say that a badly configured setup might not do it, but it 
really sounds fundamentally broken.
