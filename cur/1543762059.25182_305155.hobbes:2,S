Works so far that do_syslog is called with the correct parameters --
however, that does not work. (Did I discover a bug?)
# rcsyslog stop;  # so that kmsg is not slurped by someone else
# perl -le 'open X,"</proc/kmsg";seek X,0,2;print read X,$b,3'
the perl command should block, because with the seek(), we've just emptied the 
syslog ring buffer. Obviously, it does not, and read() succeeds - prints 3.
Any hints on what's wrong here?
