Thanks guys for all your pointers. I googled for cdparanoia and SG_IO
and found out that someone at Red Hat already patched cdparanoia to use
SG_IO. 
http://people.redhat.com/pjones/cdparanoia/
If you're interested, the patches can be found in the src rpm:
http://people.redhat.com/pjones/cdparanoia/thomasvs/cdparanoia-alpha9.8-27.src.rpm
Well, I'm gonna submit an updated ebuild for Gentoo. Let's see how this
thing evolves.
Thanks again for all your help, especially Jens!
Cheers
Sebastian
P.S.: I already reripped the test disc using ide-cd and the
SG_IO-patched cdparanoia and the results are perfect. OMG, I bought Win
XP Home 2 months ago because of this (so I can use Exact Audio Copy). I
guess I can remove XP from my drive now and sell it to some wretched guy :)
