Yes, I found that by checking the implementation of atomic_read.
But I didnt check the implementation of atomic_set before sending the
mail and assumed assigning to a variable may not be atomic on all arch,
and because of that, we may be reading a half-written, variable! But
assigning to an int is also atomic on all arch.
Thanks a lot.
