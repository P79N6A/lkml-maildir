Some people may find this more "logical", but imho most will find it
confusing... It's already difficult to inform someone about the
(number).(even|odd).(release)-(patch|pre-final) scheme. I'm more into 
	-pre: added some features, bugfixes etc...
	-fc : feature-freeze, only bugfixes
and having some time (f.i. 48h) between the last -fc and the "real" release
(without having a single addendum to the ChangeLog).
Just my 2 cents,

penguin charging at them in excess of 100mph. They'd be a lot more
careful about what they say if they had. ~(Linus Torvalds)
