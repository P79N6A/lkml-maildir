This already happens: together with <uid>-<serial>, reiser4 outputs
__FILE__, __LINE__, __FUNCTION__, and a bunch of other stuff:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
reiser4[xine(11262)]: txn_end (fs/reiser4/txnmgr.c:504)[nominaodiosasunt-2967]:
code: -2 at fs/reiser4/search.c:1285
reiser4 panicked cowardly: assertion failed: lock_stack_isclean(get_current_lock_stack())
