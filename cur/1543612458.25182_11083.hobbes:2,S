Maybe nothing in Linux should be at an hack-level I we would like to
get more desktop users ;-) (NO I'm not such a dummie user!)
Devfsd:
REGISTER snd/* PERMISSIONS root.root 666
REGISTER sound/* PERMISSIONS root.root 666
For usbfs I have to do script-hacking in /sbin/hotplug (I do not know
how I did it since it is on my brothers box somewhere at the other
end of Germany ... - but is was some if [$1 = "usb"]; then; chmod
or maybe even some find /proc -name "xyz..." ...). Especially because
I only got one parameter ($1 == usb?) the rest was empty. So even
providing filesnames what got hot-plugged would be nice.

Wouldn't it be nicer to use devfs and add this procfs hack for the
"major dists"? - They could even mount devfs to /devfs and so use
all the old-way in /dev and only use devfs for the usb stuff.
I do not know why they adapt so slowly to such a cool technology
anyway ...
