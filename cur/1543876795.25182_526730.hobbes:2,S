Is probing an interesting problem to consider on its own?  If there's
some hypervisor-agnostic device driver in Linux, then obviously it needs
some way to find the the corresponding (virtual) hardware for it to talk
to.  But that probing mechanism will depend on the actual interface
structure, and is just one of the many problems that need to be solved. 
There's no point in overloading PCI to probe for the device unless
you're actually using PCI to talk to the device.

Xen has xenbus, which is essentially a filesystem-like namespace which
can be walked to find the devices being exposed to a guest.  It is
fairly similar to OFW's device tree.

Let me say up front that I'm skeptical that we can come up with a single
bus-like abstraction which can be a both simple and efficient interface
to all the virtual architectures.  I think a more fruitful path is to
find what pieces of functionality can be made common, with the aim of
having small, simple and self-contained hypervisor-specific backends.
I think this needs to be considered on a class by class basis.  This
thread started with a discussion about entropy sources.  In theory you
could implement it as simply as exposing a mmaped ringbuffer.  There are
some extra complexities deriving from the security requirements though;
for example, all the entropy needs to be kept strictly private to the
domain that consumes it.
But beyond that, there are 3 other important classes of device:
    * console
    * disk
    * networking
(There are obviously more, but these are the must-have.)
Console already provides us with a model to work on, in the form of
hvc-console.  The hvc-console code itself has the bulk of the common
console code, along with a set of very small hypervisor-specific
backends. The Xen console implementation shrunk considerably when we
switched to using it.
If we could do the same thing with disk and net, I would be very happy.
For example, if we wanted to change the Xen frontend/backend disk
interface, we could use SCSI as the basic protocol, and then convert
netfront into a relatively simple scsi driver.  There would still be a
Xen-specific piece, but it should be fairly small and have a clean
interface.  Though the existing interface is pretty simple
shove-this-block-there affair.
I'm not sure what similar common code could be extracted for network
devices.  I haven't looked into it all that closely.
