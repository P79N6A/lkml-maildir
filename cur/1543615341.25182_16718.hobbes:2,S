The problem is that with HZ == 100 you don't have enough granularity to
correctly scale down nice time slices. Shorter time slices helps the
interactive feel that's why i'm pushing for this. Anyway i'm currently
running experiments with 30-40ms time slices. Another thing to remember is
that cpu hog processes will sit at dyn_prio 0 while processes like for
example gcc during a kernel build will range between 5-8 to 36 and in this
case their ts is actually doubled by the fact that they can require
another extra ts. For all processes that does not sit at dyn_prio 0 ( 90%
) the nice tasks cpu time is going to be half.
