I'm still not sure why that's an especially desirable feature. Every 
laptop I've played with will automatically resume from S3 when the 
battery level becomes critical, which gives you the opportunity to 
suspend to disk. And when it doesn't, you can generally emulate it using 
the ACPI alarm to wake up. Is there really a significant quantity of 
hardware out there that doesn't support either of these?
