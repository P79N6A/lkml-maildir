I started out with a clean 2.4.13 source tree, applied the
activate_page patch, and compile as follows:
make dep clean bzImage
make modules modules_install
The command `make modules_install' results in the following output:
if [ -r System.map ]; then /sbin/depmod -ae -F System.map  2.4.13; fi
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.13/kernel/fs/ramfs/ramfs.o
depmod: 	activate_page
Maybe an #include of some header file is missing somewhere?
Regards,
Toon.
