Well, I had some crashed and dead-locks (apparently) by using my mouse.
First I thought it was XFree 3.9.15 what trashed my computer... It just
rebooted. But after switching back to 3.3.4 I had 3 dead-locks. No ping,
nothing.
All this only happend, as the system was heavily used:
 * CD ripping
 * MP3 encoding
 * Some downloads (via 3com509, but via a ISDN-masquarading maschine - 64KB/s)
 * some xterms and ssh's open unter X AND
 * moving the mouse around
My System is a K6-I, 200 Mhz; 64 MB RAM; Triton based Asus Motherboard;
Permedia 2 based Graficscard; Gravis Ultrasound; 3c905B; Serial Mouse...
Everything else should be irrelevant ;)
