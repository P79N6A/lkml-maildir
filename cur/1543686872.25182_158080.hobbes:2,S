   Silly question. Related.
   Is it possible to make kernel to print oops when SIGSEGV/SIGILL is 
registered, but execution was in kernel space?
   I'm not sure about current status - but this /feature/ was advertised 
for Linux kernels: when we have a crash in kernel space e.g. in sytem 
call that calling user space application which will crash. And no notice 
about the fact, that it was actually crash inside of Linux kernel.
   Am I right or am I wrong?
