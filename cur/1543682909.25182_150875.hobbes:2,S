In case you missed it, Daniel McNeil posted this patch here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105898580610066&w=2
For some odd reason, that mail didn't show up in my lkml box,
but I grabbed his patch from the above, and it had some weird mailer
mangling in the archive, but nothing difficult to fix.
The patch works for me.  Now I can boot 2.6.0-test1-mm2 with
root=/dev/hda1 and no hex tricks.
Here is Daniel's patch.
