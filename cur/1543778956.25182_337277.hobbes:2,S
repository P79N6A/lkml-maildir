Okay -- thanks for the pointer.  There was no record of the
pach in the (incomplete-because-of-git-changeover) changelog 
for 2.6.12...

Fair comment.  I do appear now and then here, but I'll try to be 
a litle more noisy from now on...

[I I should have added here, that looking at the latest 
glibc snapshot, RLIMIT_NICE still isn't present, so still
not very visible to user-land.]

Yes, I believe it is safely bounded also.

I don't expect there are likely to be any existing yet.

Thanks.
