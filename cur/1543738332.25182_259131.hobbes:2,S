It isn't at all, just an odd side point.

The "purchase a spec" agreement has changed, right?

What about the issue of not being able to use the spec for "commercial"
applications?  And doesn't the member agreement not cover anyone who
implements the spec, and then gives that implementation to someone who
is not a member?

No, the USB bylaws explicitly forbid any member company from putting in,
or trying to claim any IP that is in the USB specs.  That is something
that makes USB quite different from IB.
I haven't had the misfortune to have to go read the PCI SIG bylaws and
member agreement...
