yep, will do so ater trying the 0.6.1 kernel.

well, to generate graphs out of the data one can choose to write the raw
cycle counts into a "history file". Then one can process this raw data to
hearts content. i will update the output routines to truncate the percentage
to %.1f [or the c++ equivalent :)]
