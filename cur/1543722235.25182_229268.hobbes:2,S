Swiching to open() on /proc/<pid>/<tid>/perfctr followed by ioctl()s
would be easy to implement. But people @ LKML are sometimes violently
opposed to ioctl()s, that's why the switch to syscalls happended.
One concern is that there doesn't appear to be a user-visible shortcut
to "your own" /proc/<pid>/<tid>/ like there was when /proc/self still
had some useful meaning. This is merely annoying, not a show-stopper.
