Well older DVD drives often only did udma33 so they would even care if
you had an 80 wire cable or not.  Newer once often require more than
udma33 for full operation.  I got a new drive about a year ago, and
burning dvd+rw at 4x worked great, but all dvd-r at 8x failed.
Eventually I realized I had to change the 40wire cable to an 80 wire,
and all problems disappeared.  The drive works fine in udma4 mode
(whatever speed that is).  My previous DVD-ROM drive had no problems
reading using a 40wire cable.
