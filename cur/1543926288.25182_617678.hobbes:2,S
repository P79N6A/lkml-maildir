Virtual Folders.
I use VM mode in EMACS, but I believe some other mail readers have the
same functionality.
I have a virtual folder called "nfs" which shows me all mail in my
inbox which has the string 'nfs' or 'lockd' in a To, Cc, or Subject
field.  When I visit that folder, I see all mail about nfs, whether it
was sent to me personally, or to a relevant list, or to lkml.
Admittedly if someone doesn't bother to choose a meaningful Subject,
then I might miss that.  I think this mostly happens when Andrew sends
a "-mm" announcement, asked people to change the subject line when
following up, and someone follows up without changing the subject line
and say "NFS doesn't work any more".
I have another virtual folder which matches "md" and "raid" and
"mdadm" in any header (so when the people from coraid.com talk about
ATA over Ethernet, that gets badly filed, but it is a small cost).
Then I have the "bkernel" (boring kernel) folder for all mail from
lkml that doesn't mention nfs or raid or md, and isn't from or to
me.  That folder I skim every week or so and just read the juicy
debates and look for interesting tidbits from interesting people -
then delete the whole folder, mostly unread.
I don't think I could cope with mail without virtual folders.
