Yes there is.  When "-pg" is passed to the linker it causes it to link
against gcrt0.o instead of crt0.o.  The former invokes "monstartup"
which starts the profiling timer.
If you don't believe me, try compiling the program exactly as I said
to do and then running it.  You will observe that the SIGPROF handler
is invoked, just not during the select().
It turns out that this behavior is documented in the gprof info pages.
(I apologize for sending my message before completely researching the
issue.)  This turns out to be inconvenient for me: I was trying to
make gprof work on a multithreaded program by intercepting SIGPROF in
the main thread and forwarding it to the child threads.  But in my
multithreaded program, the main thread is frequently blocked in a
system call, so I never get the interrupts to forward.  I hacked
around this by calling setitimer() in the child threads to enable the
profiling timer by hand.  (Yes, I understand how information can be
lost both with mcount() and with the profiling timer in the presence
of multiple threads.  But any information is better than none, which
is what you get from gprof right now for everything but the main
thread.)

mcount() generates the call graph; I am talking about the statistical
sampling provided by the profiling timer.  I understand why system
calls are not sampled, but I am not sure I like it.  High-latency
system calls can have a big effect on an application's performance.
If your application is slow because it makes too many slow system
calls, there does not seem to be any easy way to find that out; the
results of gprof can even be misleading.
