Hi all,
I just got the following kernel oops.  I think it is related to my 
earlier post.  It was copied by hand, so I can't guarentee its accuracy, but
I think that I got it right. 
Options used: -v /usr/src/linux/vmlinux (specified)
              -o /lib/modules/2.2.1/ (default)
              -k /proc/ksyms (default)
              -l /proc/modules (default)
              -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (default)
              -c 1 (default)
No modules in ksyms, skipping objects
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0000000000000008

Subject: Warning: kfree_skb passed an skb still on a list
Hi,
	When I run a benchmark against a Linux V2.2.1 kernel (No SMP) compiled
for Alpha with egcs-1.1.1, I receive the following warning:
Warning: kfree_skb passed an skb still on a list (from fffffc00004053d4).
	Should I be scared? 
	
The program that triggers this runs on a Digital Unix box, and pounds on the
Alpha/Linux httpd server (apache) over a FDDI link.  Netstat shows many
lines similar to the following:
tcp        0      0 10.0.0.1:www            10.0.0.3:2793           TIME_WAIT
This is VERY reproducable.  My config file is included. 
If you need more information, drop me a line.
