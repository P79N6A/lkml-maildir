For such ports would we need to have security system calls operating in both 
64bit and 32bit versions?  For SE Linux half the programs that use the SE 
system calls are specific to SE Linux (loading policy, showing or toggling 
"enforcing mode", etc), the other half are modified versions of ls, ps, cron, 
login, and a few other important system programs.
I can't imagine why you would want to use a 32bit policy loading program on a 
64bit SE kernel.
As for cron etc, is it going to be difficult to get those programs compiled 
for 64bit operation?

So for those ports we could have a straight 32bit interface and again have no 
problems.

Which is terribly ugly.
I agree with the point about not wanting to be converting between 32bit and 
64bit for the LSM calls.  However I am not certain that we need to support 
both 32bit and 64bit interfaces to LSM on the same platform.
