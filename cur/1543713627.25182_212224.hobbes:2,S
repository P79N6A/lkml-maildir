Hi,
I am wondering if it makes sense to strip whitespace
characters from $(EXTRAVERSION) if they exist.
Especially trailing whitespace can easily be introduced
(and overlooked) by mistake by someone who edits
this value in the Makefile.
This is not only a show stopper when it comes to
»make modules_install« but it may also cause data
loss under certain circumstances. E.g. if you
maintain an - admittedly non-standard - directory
tree named /kernel on your system, this tree will be
deleted when you invoke »make modules_install« with
trailing whitespace in $(EXTRAVERSION) (and thus
in $(MODLIB) as well):
.PHONY: modules_install
modules_install: _modinst_ $(patsubst %, _modinst_%, $(SUBDIRS))
_modinst_post
.PHONY: _modinst_
_modinst_:
    @rm -rf $(MODLIB)/kernel
    @rm -f $(MODLIB)/build
    @mkdir -p $(MODLIB)/kernel
    @ln -s $(TOPDIR) $(MODLIB)/build
Similar arguments may hold true for other macros
as well (like $(VERSION), $(PATCHLEVEL) etc.), but
these are much less likely touched by an ordinary
user who just wants to recompile his kernel.
After all, this is not a big issue, but I would like to
know what others think about it.
Just in case, there is a trivial one-liner against
2.4.25 below to remove whitespace from $(EXTRAVERSION) before it
is used elsewhere. Note that there is a space and a tab
inside the sed braces.
(One could also think about proper quoting to allow whitespace
in $(EXTRAVERSION), but I'm not so sure if whitespace makes
much sense in it, anyway.)
