Ok. I'm linking to the vdso directly from test apps at the moment but
that will die as soon as glibc has been adapted. Just let me know what
you prefer. I can keep the descriptors as-is and glibc would take care
of offset'ing properly when calling them, or I could try to find some
way to export different symbols like Ulrich suggested... whatever you
prefer for the glibc side.
Ben.
