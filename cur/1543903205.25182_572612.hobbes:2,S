OK.  indent will indent labels to a column number that's a multiple of
8, plus 6.  So it may start in column 6, 14, 20, 28, etc.  I'm not quite
sure what the definition of a label is; I had it as \w*: up there, but I
don't know if that would match the _.  The point is to *not* handle case
labels, only goto labels.
