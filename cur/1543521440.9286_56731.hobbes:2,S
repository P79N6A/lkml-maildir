A more productive way forward might be to make a version of 
the tftp or bootp server that can link up a kernel+initrd
combination on demand when the request comes in.  So you
still have two different files on the server side, if that
is what you need for maintainability.
Apart from keeping stuff out of the kernel, this means you 
can load the network driver from the initrd with insmod 
options, etc.
