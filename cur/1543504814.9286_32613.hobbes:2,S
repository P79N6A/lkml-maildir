Hi.
Iam trying to find a way to get the physical addr given the user virtual
addr.
i thought the following would get the virtual to physical mapping but what i
find is current->mm is NULL 
all the time.
user program obtains memory using malloc()
addr  = malloc(size);
then passes this to a kernel module for translation to physical addr
pgd  = pgd_offset(current->mm, addr);
pmd = pmd_offset(pgd, addr);
pte = pte_offset(pmd, addr);
if (pte_present(*pte))
	page = pte_page(*pte);
i have seen that always the current->mm is NULL.
I have tried to do the same to a mmap addr returned by the kernel and
passing it back to kernel 
for translation. That did not work either.
addr = mmap(...) // driver maps some register set to user space
still i notice that the mm is NULL, i thought that i should probably use
init_mm instead of current->mm since
this is a kernel mm, but still pte_present returns FALSE.
Am i missing something here?
thanks for any help.
Cheers,

Plug-and-Play is really nice, unfortunately it only works 50% of the time.
To be specific the "Plug" almost always works.
