	System sometime freezes for about 2-3 second, and alsa 0.9.4 refuses to work 
correctly.
toptan@azdaha:~> aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/test.wav
Playing WAVE '/usr/share/sounds/alsa/test.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, 
Rate 44100 Hz, Stereo
aplay: pcm_write:1025: write error: Input/output error
	Well it plays, but only first 500msec, and repeats it about ten times.
	Same thing with alsa was happening with 2.5.54-59, so I think its scheduler 
problem.
	ck1 worked fine.
Distro is SuSE 8.2
Config & lspci -vvvv are attached.
