response to questions does vary drasticly, I've been reading the list for
almost 5 years now and while I seldom post most of the time I get an
immediate response (unfortunantly sometimes I can't folow up immediatly
with the requested info). When I don't get a response for a few days I try
to get more detail on the problem and repost, eventually I do get some
response.
one thing to remember about posting here. if you get a response that is
just wrong, argue back, point out why it's wrong. Everyone on this list
(up to and including Linus) makes mistakes and dismisses stuff to quickly
at times. some questions get asked frequently enough that they have a
canned answer (useing binary only modules and reporting a bug for example)
but most of the time there is a real answer eventually.
