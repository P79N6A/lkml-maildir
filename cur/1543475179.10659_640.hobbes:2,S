The main reason to use the frame buffer code, in my opinion, is in cases where
the chipset is not supported at all.  (My 16 meg Voodoo2 Banshee card, for
example.)  Adding chipset detection for existing cards in the X client is just
going to make it slower.  Better to optimize the X driver for the framebuffer.
(But that is something for the XFree86/XOpen lists, not here...)
