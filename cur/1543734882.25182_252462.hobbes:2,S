Having maintained my own tree for a while, what I'd suggest is to keep a
sequence of flat patches, then apply and port then ONE AT A TIME to each
new kernel version. Once you get a system down, it really doesn't take
long to do. 
Personally I find source control tools utterly useless for exactly this 
reason. Akpm uses his own set of tools which someone packaged up as
"quilt" I think. I have a similar set that works by patch number, his
are controlled by a series file. Suggest you look at his tools - if he
can manage a release every few days with several hundred patches in, they
must work pretty well ;-)
