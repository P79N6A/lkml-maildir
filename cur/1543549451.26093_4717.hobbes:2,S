Hi
I already tried to find anything related to this in the kernel archives,
but found nothing. As I do not know if this is a "bug" or "feature",
here it goes. It does the same on 2.3.99pre9. I'm running 2.4.0-test8.
mount is mount-2.10o.
thecrypt:/# mount  
/dev/hda1 on / type ext2 (rw,errors=remount-ro)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
thecrypt:/# mount /dev/hda1 /mnt
thecrypt:/# mount
/dev/hda1 on / type ext2 (rw,errors=remount-ro)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
/dev/hda1 on /mnt type ext2 (rw)
So, I have now the same filesystem mounted in two mountpoints.
Is this OK ? It used not to be.
