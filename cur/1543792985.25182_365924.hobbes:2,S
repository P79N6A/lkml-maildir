The notify_die stuff is wonderful.  If I had a ppc64 board, I'd give
that a whirl myself.  This does, unless there was something I missed,
tie into the existing debugger pointer stuff (thats similar but
different from ppc32).  Assuming it hasn't started already, if I can
find time I might give it a wack on arch/powerpc, since I assume my
AlBook works (if not, I see my LongTrail might ;))
