so please tell me Jeff. If Greg, who is the super-maintainer of your 
code area, and who deals with your code every day and changes it every 
minute and hour, simply did not Cc: the SCSI list - how am i, a largely 
outside party in this matter, supposed to notice that 3 maintainers and 
3 mailing lists in the Cc: were somehow not enough and that i was 
supposed to grow the already sizable Cc: list even more?
