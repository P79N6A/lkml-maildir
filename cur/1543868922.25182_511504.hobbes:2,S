In theory no, because the COW-ed pages become anonymous and are not
part of the original mapping any more.

Because there's no way to know inside the set_page_dirty() functions
if the dirtying comes from a memory mapping or from a modification
through a normal write().  And they have different semantics, for
write() the modification times are updated immediately.
