Subject: [CFT] updated linux kernel preemption patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Updated preempt-kernel patches for 2.4.12, 2.4.13, 2.4.14, 2.4.13-ac7
and 2.4.15-pre4 (whew) are available at:
        
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/preempt-kernel
There are patches for older kernels, too, but they are not in sync with
this release.
Major change is I merged ARM support.
Thankfully the non-atomic change seems to not of generated _any_
problems.  Good stuff.
Note 2.4.13-ac8 is incompatible with preemption due to the %cr2 task
coloring change.  Since 2.4.15-pre2 looks to be fairly well merged with
Linus, I would recommend using that.
Full ChangeLog:
20011112
- make preempt_enable conditional unlikely
- merge ARM support
20011102
- (ac tree only) back out tty race fix as it was merged with proper
