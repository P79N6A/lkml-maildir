How is idle_noop different from idle_poll?
idle_halt is equivalent to idle_acpi_C1. But acpi supports also C2
(deeper sleep), and C3 (sleep without coherent caches) and newer
machines support even more. You might want to talk to Len Brown.
[And yes, limiting to C2 (for example) *is* usefull; some machines
(nforce2 iirc) have bugs, and die if you do C3 at wrong time].
