Before it gets freed it may end up being copied.  Example: vfsmounts
A and B are peers, C is a slave of that peer group.  It happens to be
on slave list of B.  B has root deeper than A, which, in turn is deeper
than that of C (e.g. A and B had been created by binding subtrees of
C, which had been made slave afterwards).  We bind on something in A,
outside of the subtree mapped by B.
Alternatively, have A -> (B, D) -> C, with C on slave list of B.  Mountpoint
is within subtrees for A, C and D, but not B.  And no, we can't say "skip B,
just make a slave of tree on A and slap it on C" - correct result is to
have T_A -> T_D -> T_C (i.e. tree on C gets propagation from tree on D).
Which kills the variants with not creating that copy and making subsequent
ones directly from the original tree.
