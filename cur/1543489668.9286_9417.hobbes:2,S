The 3dfx can lock the pci bus if fed garbage. The /dev/3dfx driver
doesn't stop garbage being fed in, and so has no benefit over suid
glide libs which tickle the hardware directly.
Imagine if writing a bad byte sequence to /dev/dsp caused your hdd
to corrupt itself. This is basically the same thing. It's not what
you expect from a /dev interface, so it gets the thumbs down.

The proper way is to have an opengl interface which prevents nasty
garbage being sent to the 3dfx card. This has numerous other neato
benefits too, like hardware independence for 3d developers, and an
already well documented API that ties in nicely with X11 if you're
looking for that sort of thing.
