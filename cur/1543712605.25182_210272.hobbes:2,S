It does, if a file for that kobject is opened.  In this case, there was
no file opened, so the module refcount isn't incremented.

Well, as the module refcount was never incremented, it does not do this.
I just verified this (accidentally) by removing my lp modules and then
doing a bk pull.  kswapd forced the stale dentry out, which decremented
the kobject reference count, which then tried to call the release
function in the (now gone) lp module.  My machine then spit up a lovely
oops, and was reduced to a unusable sludge as there was no more kswapd
running :(

Nope, oopses will happen.  You can verify this yourself by doing much of
what I just did.
This needs to get fixed, as it's not just a USB issue (so I've added
lkml on the cc list.)

Will that get rid of the references properly nwhen we remove the
kobject?
