Can we back this out please?  As I noted on lkml once I saw this, it
still doesn't fix the problem of overwriting files in lib/zlib_inflate/
if ZLIB_INFLATE!=n, and adding explicit rules for lib/zlib_inflate/foo.c
-> ./foo.o looks quite bad (it's 2 calls if we want checker to get
invoked, one if we skip doing that).  At the end of the thread, both
Roland and I were hoping Sam knew of a clever solution to this.
