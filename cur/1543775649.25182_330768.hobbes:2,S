Hmmm. I guess this would be in the (imho unlikely) situation where you
have both PATA and SATA drives connected to the ICH6M.
I do see the problem, though. It's a "works for me(r)" solution ;-)

Bzzzt! Nice theory, but in practise, MANY bioses (including mine) don't
offer the choice to put the controller in whatever mode. Add to that,
that if you only have pata drives attached, it doesn't make much sense
to drive it with libata.
I'd be happy to drive my ICH6M with libata, but it just doesn't work
well. No smart&hdparm (the corresponding patch freezes the kernel every
now and then) support, drives show up as scsi drives..., no atapi
(unless #defined, but also not yet bugfree).
Well anyway, this is just my $0.02 I guess it won't make it into the
kernel, but you never know how might be able to use it.
