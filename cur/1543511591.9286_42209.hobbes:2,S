| i got an kernel oops in d_lookup
This is very interesting, because I got this same oops in
2.3.18ac10 (yes, in 2.3 kernel and yours is 2.2)
The routine looks about the same so this is very possibly the
same bug.

I got it while compiling X with make -j3 (SMP system) so there
is also heavy disk activity) 
There are some similarities too as I also have SCSI system with
Adaptec 2940U2W adapter and IBM U2W disk.

I am now running 2.2.13-pre14 (haven't had the time to compile
pre15) and it works just fine too. Alan, are there any backports 
from 2.3 that might cause this?

Yes, my oops also occured after some time of heavy activity
(compiling X takes about 20-25 minutes on my machine now and it
was about half done)
