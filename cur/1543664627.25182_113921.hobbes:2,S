Even the patch isn't *necessary* (i.e. does not change behaviour) it's
still a good idea.
I've been working on a -Wboolean-bitops. It seems to work at least a
bit, but I don't really know anything about gcc so it's probably
brain-damaged. Alas, current gcc CVS seems to have real issues with the
kernel ATM (as in, segfaults on scripts/empty.c immediately).
