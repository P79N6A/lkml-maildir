It is *highly* recommended that you change the kernel identifier at
least slightly, so that you can install '2.6.20-1.local' without overlaying
the vendor-supplied 2.6.20-1 kernel.  Among other things, this lets you
boot back to the equivalent code level in the vendor kernel, so you can figure
out if it's your .config file that's broken, or if you hit a bug upggrading
from 2.6.19-10 to 2.6.20-1.
