Portability, which is what started this whole discussion in the first
place. Try taking the script:
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
print "Hello, world!\n";
and running it unmodified on the multitude of UNIX variants out there.
The 'eval' trick is a much more portable way of doing it:
: # -*- Perl -*-
eval 'exec perl -w -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
	if 0;
print "Hello, world!\n";
More readable, no. More portable? Absolutely. You'll be hard-pressed to
find a UNIX variant this doesn't actually run on.
