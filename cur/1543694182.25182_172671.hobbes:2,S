I have a long-running cpu hog background task, and a high-priority 
critical task that waits on a socket for network traffic.  When a packet 
comes in, I'd like the cpu hog to be swapped out ASAP, rather than 
waiting for the end of the timeslice.  Is there any way to make this happen?
The code paths that I managed to trace didn't seem to be calling the 
scheduler to force the context switch.  Hopefully I missed something.
Thanks,
Chris
