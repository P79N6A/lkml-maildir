Of course it works without it. I never said it is a required feature, only
a very nice to have. Namely:
a) if devfs is available it provides a regular file whose size can be
examined by applications and content read/written without much "fuss". In
particular it is very convenient to say "vi microcode" and examine the
content directly. If it was a device node then this would have been
impossible.
b) if devfs is not available then a limited basic functionality is
provided --- i.e. just update the microcode on CPU(s) and write the log
messages in the kernel log.
Btw, having a size of mtrr is also useful for a similar reason.
