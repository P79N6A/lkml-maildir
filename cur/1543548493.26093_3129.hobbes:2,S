I'm not using SMP but you both put me on the right track.
init/main.c:start_kernel does:
        setup_arch(&command_line);
        trap_init();
        init_IRQ();
trap_init does the set_system_gate(FOO_VECTOR, &handler) lines I
extended but then init_IRQ() does
        for (i = 0; i < NR_IRQS; i++) {
                int vector = FIRST_EXTERNAL_VECTOR + i;
                if (vector != SYSCALL_VECTOR) 
                        set_intr_gate(vector, interrupt[i]);
        }
and promptly zaps everything except SYSCALL_VECTOR.
(FIRST_EXTERNAL_VECTOR is 0x20). Many thanks.
