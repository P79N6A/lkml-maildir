Subject: [PATCH][2.4] serial.c xmit fifo overflow bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Attached is a patch to correct a xmit fifo overflow bug in serial.c. I 
limited the changes to a patch and not a feature addition which would add 
support for programming the tx fifo interrupt threshold. 
I've tested it on an embedded system which uses an Exar ST16C654 QUART.
