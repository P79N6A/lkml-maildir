Thanks very much to all those who pointed out ways to see the
interrupt activity.
Just a quick report: I am not seeing an inordinate number of
interrupts/sec when playing MP3 files. I see about 45/second on the
sound card interrupt.
It appears that my 350Mhz K6-2 just doesn't have the MP3 playing balls
that my 300Mhz P2, because it pretty much brings the K6 to its knees.
If anyone has any ideas why this is so, I would like to hear it (via
email I imagine since this has become offtopic?).
thanks again.
