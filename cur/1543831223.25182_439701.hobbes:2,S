nice! I sort of am not a big fan of if .. prefetch() but if it shows
gain... then you convinced me. 0.4% is roughly the same order I saw.
It's not gigantic but it's almost free to do so it may be worth it
anyway... 
Can you send me your patch so that I can integrate it (and I'll port
your if() to the prefetch)...
