t=`printf '\t'`
sed -i "s_^\($t*\)  *\([^:]*:\)_\1\2_" "$@"

I'm not sure about leaving one space `here, otherwise it removes
spaces between (supposedly right indented) line start, i.e. nothing or
tab(s), and a label, i.e. `label_name:' without space before colon;
`label_name' here actually not a colon, let's leave that kind of
breakage to compiler.
The variable $t is used for readability of the regex and because POSIX
BREs leave undefined characters after a backslash, POSIX sed defines
only \n as a new line.
