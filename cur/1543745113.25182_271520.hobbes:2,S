another potential API would be to use the linear priority range that the
scheduler has internally, from 0 (RT prio 99) to 140 (nice +19). I'm not
sure which solution is the better one. Using the linear priority has the
advantage of not having to pass any policy value - priorities between 0
and 99 implicitly mean SCHED_FIFO, priorities above that would mean
SCHED_NORMAL, a pretty natural and compact interface.
