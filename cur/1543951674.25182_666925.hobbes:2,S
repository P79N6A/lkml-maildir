Two things:
1. The dma_sync should probably be done before the context_append
because the controller could in theory start reading the data as soon as
context_append is called right?
2. As an optimization, we should attempt to allocate the payload in the
lower 32-bits of physical memory, to prevent extra memcopies on x86_64.
I think this can be done by adding GFP_DMA32 to kmalloc where the
payload was allocated in fw-cdev.c.  There might be other places where
we would benefit from GFP_DMA32 also.  Of course, these optimizations
are probably better saved for another patch.
