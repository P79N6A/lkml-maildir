The quicklists have been existing for a long time in this relationship 
and were actually developed initially (by Dave Miller I believe) to work 
this way. The generic TLB flushing thing may have developed in parallel on 
other platforms that did not use quicklists.

Hmmmm.. Right the integration of the approaches that have now diverged on 
various platforms could be better.

I guess we need to re-join what was separated by developments on different 
platforms.

Right. But will that not mean that quicklists would have to be used on all 
platforms in a generic way?
