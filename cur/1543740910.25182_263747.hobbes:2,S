Well, there are the via k8m800 chipsets. That's (I believe?) a unichrome2
IGP, which should have opensource DRI support via unichrome.sf.net (caveat
- I have a unichrome1 in an epia M1000, not the athlon64 variant). It's no
hot-rod performer, but it's good enough for tuxracer and neverball. I have
no idea how it really compares performance-wise to the intel stuff, but it
does at least have open drivers and reasonable GL acceleration.
