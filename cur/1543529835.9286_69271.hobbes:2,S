No. There WILL NOT be anything available in worst-case scenario. Unless by
not overcommiting you mean "keep 3GiB of virtual memory for each task" and
THIS solution is clearly unappropriate.

Ok. Filesystem can need buffer :-) "You will never make a foolproof system"
is exactly right. And without overcommiting many currently working system
will die with "Out of memory" message out of syslogd or init ...

It does. All the time. It tries to keep used memory smal, obviously but it's
really hard to predict how much kernel will need.

Exactly like without overcommiting. So
  1) with overcommiting you get random program crashes, lost work, etc.
  2) without overcommiting you get random program crashes (just MERGINALLY less
random), lost work, etc and you need MUCH more swap.
What do you prefer ?
