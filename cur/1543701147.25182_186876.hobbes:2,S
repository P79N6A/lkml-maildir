I'm seeing the same here:
open("/dev/cd-rw", O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK)   = -1 EROFS (Read-only file system)
write(2, "cdrecord.mmap: Read-only file sy"..., 89cdrecord.mmap: Read-only file system. Cannot open '/dev/cd-rw'. Cannot open SCSI driver.) = 89
Looking at the error path, it looks like it happens in cdrom.c:
cdrom_open() in line 747 -> cdrom_open_write() in line 708
 -> cdrom_mrw_open_write() in line 680, where there's:
        if (!di.erasable)
                return 1;
which is where it fails. di isn't filled correctly by
cdrom_get_disc_info(cdi, &di)
ie: change the "if (!di.erasable) return 1;"
to "if (!di.erasable) return 0;" and it will work.
Jens Axboe is listed in the changelog so he may know what's the issue here.
