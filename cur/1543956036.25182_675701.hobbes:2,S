I plan to mention other arches in the call for testing, so I guess we'll 
find out.

Of course there are ;-)
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/lenny/main/installer-i386/current/images/floppy/
These use 2.6.22. They don't have the fix I just implemented though. If the 
IDE controller is not detected, try booting the installer with 
hw-detect/load-ide=true
The daily built images, which do have the fix, use 2.6.24, but the increase 
in the size of the kernel causes the boot floppy to be too big so 
installing from floppy is currently not possible. We're working on fixing 
that.

That's an alternative. Use either the netboot or hd-media images for that, 
and it means that you could use a daily image. With the hd-media images 
you'll also need to copy a CD image on the hard disk.
