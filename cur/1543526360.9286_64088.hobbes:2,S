Right, it's a gcc extension.  (ISO rather recently came up with
different syntax -- which I can't remember exactly except that IMHO
it's ugly -- to do the same thing.  They couldn't just use gcc syntax,
could they?  Nooooo....)  I guess it kind of goes without saying that
the missing fields always get nulls.
The advantages of initializing structures this way are obvious:
increased source compatibility when fields are added/removed/moved, and
readability (no need for a comment for each member).
