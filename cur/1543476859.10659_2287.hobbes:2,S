This is plain wrong. Really many things use it. Just scan all your binaries
for vfork, you'll be surprised. The thing is that not many things rely on
whether it works as documented vfork, or whether it is the same as fork.
But, if you read the NetBSD paper, you'll find out vfork has several
advantages, which are worth of considering.
