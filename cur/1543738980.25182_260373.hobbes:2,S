Well, if you do and the same thing happens, we know that there is something
reproducible here. That is always good to know. It might be that you did
something a week ago and forgot all about it and now have a strange bug.
If this is reproducible, then there are lots of possible explanations.
Have you considered the numbering of the disks? You changed things in
the BIOS. Did the Linux SCSI disk numbering remain the same?
