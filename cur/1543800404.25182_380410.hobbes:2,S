Thank you for the reply.  Comments inline.

This is what I wanted but I could not figure out how do it.  If you tell me 
how I will be happy to change it.  I tried  if (p->base == 0x378) but then 
class_device_create does not get executed.

The last experience I have with off board cards was about 5 years ago.  The 
choices for the two parallel ports were 378, 278, or 3BC.  I was not aware 
that you had flexibility now.

As I said above I was not aware todays off board parallel ports had more 
choices.  I will see what I can do to fix this.  Do you have any 
suggestions?
Thanks,
