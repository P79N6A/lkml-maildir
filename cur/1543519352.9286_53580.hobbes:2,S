Hi
I have a RAID "array" consisting of two IDE disks, which I've been
running a striped partition across.  When I upgraded from 2.3.26 to
2.3.33 and added the necessary partitions (the definitions in the
mdtab had been there for a while) for another striped /dev/md1 and
a mirrored /dev/md2, the system refused to boot.  It all ended with
the somewhat cryptic "Got md request, not good..." message from 
block/drivers/md.c (I suppose), whereupon the system hangs.
I thought of an upgrade of mdtools, but unfortunately, the
Documentation/md.txt contains a reference to a machine that
appears to be nonexisten (or at least misspelled)
I guess I should add that the system hangs before mounting the first
md partition - which used to work - and it isn't a root partition, or
anything else important.
I'm taking the liberty of posting to the list, since at least the
documentation needs fixing, but please CC any suggestions to me directly!
