I do not think that Suspend 2 needs 14000 lines for that, the core is
much smaller. But besides, _not_ saving the pagecache is a really _bad_
idea. I expect to have my system back after resume, in the same state I
had left it prior to suspend. I really do not like it how it is done by
Windows, it is just ugly to have a slowly responding system after
resume, because all caches and buffers are gone.
I can only speak for myself, but I want to work with my system from the
moment my desktop is back.
Regards,
Matthias
