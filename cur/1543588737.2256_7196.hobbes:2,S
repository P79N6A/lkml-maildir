That is probably unrelated to the ps hang. I suspect you are been bitten by the
ext2 metadata corruption (2.4.4pre2 was just fixed but previous kernel wasn't).

No, but I think they are two separate issues.

yes to be sure you can run it without my patch and see if it hangs (I never
tried that myself, but I was able to reproduce the ps hang quite easily and it
was quite obviously due the rwsemaphores and it gone away completly after I
used the generic semaphores).
