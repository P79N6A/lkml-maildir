Here's a quote from the official syndicated kernelnewbies fortunes
file (
http://www.kernelnewbies.org/kernelnewbies-fortunes.tar.gz
 ):
"Basically, ioctl's will _never_ be done right, because of the way people
 think about them. They are a back door. They are by design typeless and
 without rules. They are, in fact, the Microsoft of UNIX."
	- Linus Torvalds on linux-kernel
