Cool, If I see anybody
struggling, I point them to the
fix you posted.
I also might be missing something, i.g.
one of the boxes that gave this error I built
with debootstrap, but then the other that gave this as well
was built with nubuntu which seems more complete
than debootstrap.
but then maybe both are missing a package.
(or it's a debian thing)
