I'm still working on this; tried Matt's patch against 2.6.13 last night,
but it seems 2.6.13 has broken raw sockets for pptp and pptpd ...
ENOPROTOOPT returned from the read() on the raw socket carrying the GRE
stream from pptp to the net.  Wasn't happening with 2.6.12.5.
My plan is to try Matt's patch against 2.6.12.5, and try 2.6.13 bare, to
isolate the cause of the ENOPROTOOPT changed behaviour.
The previous version of Matt's patch (before the SC_MUST_COMP feature)
is working fine for me with 2.6.12.5.
(If anyone has any ideas on raw socket breakage, let me know.  2.6.13
changed net/ipv4/raw.c but the changes look to me to be minor.)
