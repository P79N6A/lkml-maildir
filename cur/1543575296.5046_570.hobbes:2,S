OK. I simply copied that from shm.c without thinking. Actually I do
not yet understand the implications of it. (I never thought that I
would get so deeply involved into these issues and still struggle
often with the details)

Only reasonable? :-(
It's what I always thought would be the Right Thing (TM):
1) The mm layer should have the abilty to handle shared anonymous
   pages
2) To access this we should use the 'everything is a file' mantra
   which means shm fs
3) sysv shm should only care about handling shm ids (and it special
   attributes which unfortunately makes shm_vm_operations necessary.)
So how would you improve it conceptually? And where are the
implementation flaws?
And compared to all the ipc/shm.c hacks we had so far it looks for me
beautiful. (And to make this clear: The main part is not my work. I
simply gathered the work of others to make this possible)
        Christoph
