Hello Richard Purdie,
NAK, Even though we can use it. it's out of Spec. It's reason I don't add
it.
In your swap patch, swap device only uses 4 bytes. so it's enough in
current driver. so we don't need to patch it.
+struct swpdev_oobdata {
+	u16 magic;
+	u16 type;
+} __attribute__((packed));
+
+#define SWPDEV_OOBSIZE		sizeof(struct swpdev_oobdata)
+
+	struct mtd_oob_ops ops;
+
+	ops.len = SWPDEV_OOBSIZE;
+	ops.ooblen = SWPDEV_OOBSIZE;
+	ops.oobbuf = buf;
+	ops.ooboffs = swpdev->fsdata_pos;
+	ops.datbuf = NULL;
+	ops.mode = MTD_OOB_PLACE;
I think this patch is only used at YAFFS case. it uses 28 bytes at spare.
But current spare areas are 20 bytes (2KB page).
Thank you,
Kyungmin Park
