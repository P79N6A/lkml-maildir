No it doesn't -- it's the other way around. It assumes that if
xfer->tx_buf is NULL, the user didn't provide a buffer so it has to
use the scratch buffer instead. The driver never does PIO transfers,
so if tx_buf is valid, tx_dma ought to be valid  too. This is taken
care of elsewhere by calling dma_map_single() if the user provided a
virtual pointer but not a dma address.
Checking for an invalid cpu-virtual pointer really should be
equivalent to checking for an invalid DMA address at this point.
I could perhaps add else blocks to those two ifs and add the offset to
the respective dma addresses there instead if it makes it clearer. The
tests are supposed to be the same as before, but I had to change them
one way or another because of the added offset (which would make an
invalid dma address non-invalid.)

Yes, but are there any drivers that will provide a valid dma address
and a NULL cpu-virtual pointer? That would indeed break my
assumptions, but it would also break any PIO-only drivers, wouldn't
it?
