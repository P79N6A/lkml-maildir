I don't think so.  It only needs be exported if a module is going to
use it.  Since you're building it in, not as a module, it should be
fine.
My own 'make defconfig' on a clean BK tree, enabling CONFIG_EDD=y,
links correctly.  Perhaps a make mrproper; make would be in order, as the
deps stage should have caught it for you...
Thanks,
Matt
