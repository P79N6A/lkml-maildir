We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.17.13 kernel.
This fixes two build errors with the 2.6.17.12 release.  If you aren't
experiencing them, there is no need to upgrade.  We are very sorry for
for the mistakes that happened with the .12 release, and those
responsible have been sacked.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.17.12 and 2.6.17.13, as it is small enough to do so.
The updated 2.6.17.y git tree can be found at:
 	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.17.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
	www.kernel.org/git/
thanks,
greg k-h
