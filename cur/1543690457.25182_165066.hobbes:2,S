Could you be kind enough to post here the example code for a SIGSEGV handler
that would be necessary for old kernels ?
I do think it woul help some people like me, for the future googling on the
prefetch errata.
I do use preftechnta instructions on my programs, and this errata could
explain some strange crashes.
As the program crashing is a huge multi-threaded network application, with
up to 300000 opened TCP sockets, the SIGSEGV fault is usually followed by a
system crash (networks buffers using all of lowmem)
