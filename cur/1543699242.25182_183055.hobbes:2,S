Or get RedHat or Fedora to apply the patch.
Its a slightly safer bet though to have it in stock 2.4, guarantees
it will be there if one needs it 2 years down the road when upgrading
some box. (and non-LVM users wont be compiling it in).
So personally I'd rather Marcelo included it, being paranoid about
having support for access to data.
