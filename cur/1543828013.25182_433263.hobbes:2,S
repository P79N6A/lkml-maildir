Agreed that all users will be notified. Once that happens, what do you expect
these users will do to the applications they are running that
a) query per-task data periodically, or
b) monitor exit data
Either these applications will continue running (querying, listening) and
have to understand that they cannot expect more data
or they will be stopped(or suspended) from doing the monitoring/querying.
If its the latter, then we don't really need kernel changes since we only save on
a little bit of assembling data overhead.
If its the former, then yes, it will be useful to have the kernel changes.

I don't get the difference between these two options as far as kernel is concerned.
A systemwide switch that can be set by only by a privileged user is what is needed
either way, right ? Whether it is in sys/kernel (through sysfs) or
/proc/sys/kernel (through /proc and via sysctl) ? Or is there something else that an
/etc/init.d/taskstats script can do to set a kernel parameter ?
