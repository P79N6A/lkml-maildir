I (incorrectly) based my assumptions on the fact that "modinfo dummy"
didn't return any information about the module parameter. I also had a
look at some other modules, like "bonding", "rtl8139", and I assumed
that the MODULE_* macros were the 2.6.x way of doing things.
I was obviously wrong, sorry for the waste of time (anyways, it seems
there are several kernel modules waiting to be updated, maybe I should
give them a look and learn something and try to "fix" them).
Greetings.
