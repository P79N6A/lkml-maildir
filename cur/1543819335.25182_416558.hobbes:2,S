Hi All,
I don't know if this is the right list to report this, if not excuse me
for posting.
Since kernel 2.6.16 I experience panics on reboot/shutdown in
device_shutdown on my dell laptop (pentium-m).
I've fixed this by commenting all references to device_shutdown in
kernel/sys.c which solves the problem for me, strange thing however is
that this machine is the only one I can reproduce this, both a dual
athlon and several pentium III machines run fine with the latest 2.6.16.7
Here's the patch to fix it in case someone else experiences the same
problems but I wonder what could cause this and if disabling
device_shutdown as I did could cause any problems?
