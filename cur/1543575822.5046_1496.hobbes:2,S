CORBA is slow compared to some of the other solutions. The question I was 
trying to ask is whether you should put something smaller and faster into the
kernel space and leave CORBA in userland. It's complex, it has security 
implications surely it belongs talking something simple and fast to the kernel.
If you look at microkernels they talk a much simpler faster rpc protocol.
