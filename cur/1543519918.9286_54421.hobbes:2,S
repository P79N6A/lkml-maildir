Hello all.. Just recycling my old message as upgrading has not solved the
problem. 
Linux fall.disp.pwac 2.3.33 #1 Thu Dec 16 21:05:23 EST 1999 i686 unknown
I do have more information though.  I am suffering from the same symptoms,
although I have just realized that it did not begin until after the first
time power management kicked on in X with Netscape running.  The display
has started flickering again based on my mouse usage, and my bank is
kicking me off again.
The funny thing is, this machine has been up and in X:
  3:22pm  up 2 days, 16:46,  6 users,  load average: 1.00, 0.99, 0.61
and the problem has only just started occuring a few moments ago.  Again,
I believe the only difference is that I did not have netscape open during
all the other times that X may have gone into dpms.  Maybe something to do
with threaded apps?  I have not tryed to unarchive the kernel file again,
but here are some notes from when I did: the tar process could not be
killed suspended or -9'd, I was able to unarchive it from an older kernel.
