I was thought it was to speed processing if the
caller was already in process context. Maybe the
real intentions are lost to history.
Moving forward, Alan stated that the flip
routine should not be called in interrupt context.
His last post concerning some transient state
of low_latency has confused me.
Currently, with the 8250 driver and N_TTY
line discipline, calling the flip routine from
ISR causes an SMP deadlock. There are two paths that
cause this:
1. low_latency is set
2. flip buffer becomes full
So calling the flip routine from the ISR may work
with some specific drivers, but it would be
dangerous to assume this works in all cases.
