Two changelogs always sends me into a panic.  It's easier when they are
identical ;)

I assume that it's global for the benefit of the second patch.
Yes, we do put a lot of extern-decls-in-C over in sysctl.c.  But that
doesn't make it good.  It would be better to add the declaration to a
header which is visible to all sites which use the symbol.
We should perhaps have a standalone sysctl-definitions.h for this
purpose, so we don't end up having to #include <everything> in
sysctl.c.

I dunno what type those tv_secs have, but the whole thing is cast to a
long and is then signed-compared with an integer.
Is this correct and intended?  I guess it is, but..  just checking?
