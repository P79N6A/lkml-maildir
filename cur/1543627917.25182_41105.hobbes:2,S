Yep. That makes sense. /proc/slabinfo looks like
inode_cache        60311  60312    512 8616 8616    1
dentry_cache       60301  63930    128 2131 2131    1
buffer_head        35115  40620    128 1348 1354    1
this is on a 256mb machine.
Would I be right in saying that the only way that memory gets reclaimed 
, is by some process requesting memory
or by some process waking up and having a load of page faults?
Cheers,
Tony.
