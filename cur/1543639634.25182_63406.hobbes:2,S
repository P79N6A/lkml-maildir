That's what I though.

Actually I need 95% and the file will grow on demand so it's pretty
hefty in use; I really need to invent some hack to avoid touching
the memory as much as we do now without any need.

Interestingly the behaviour seems to be quite different on PPC vs.
i386. On my PPC machine with 256 MB RAM I have constant use swap and
all of the "free" memory is used as cache. On a i386 maschine with
512MB RAM the kernel never touched a single byte of swap and around
150MB are always free. Both machines always have a load > 1 and are
used for big compile jobs like gcc, OpenOffice and alike.
