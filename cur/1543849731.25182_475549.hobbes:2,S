Someplace along the line, either a make oldconfig screwed up, or my .config 
chain of succession my scripts use got totally fubared when I was trying 
to build 19-rc2.
After 3 more rebuilds to add stuff like emu10k1 & the RAMFS bits, -rc2 has 
now booted.  So now we wait for the other shoe to drop & see if the auto 
powerdowns persist.
