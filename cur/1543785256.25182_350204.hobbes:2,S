May I ask you to name those drivers/HBAs, it would be interesting to
look at how REPORT_LUN results are interpreted there. Actually, the data
from the  REPORT_LUN response is always treated as proper  8 byte LUN
and it is converted to int by scsilun_to_int(). What is interesting is
how those derivers/HBA treat integer "lun" in queuecommand or EH calls.

I am not aware of any SCSI/FC/SAS/etc hardware which uses more then just
first two bytes, but all drivers I looked at to proper bytes
rearrangement for those two bytes, and, as a result they do support 00b
and 01b addressing modes.

IMHO one 8 byte LUN is better then wtf. I's kinda obvious :)
