Hi there,
I have troubles in using nfs-file-locking
on a linux based cluster. Here the relevant
system parameters:
kernel 2.2.2
knfs   on
SuSE   6.0 (glibc)
I need process synchronization via the flock
mechanism in a heterogenious linux/solaris
cluster. But even within the linux cluster
file locking does not work properly. Having
linux nodes lnxA and lnxB and solaris (2.6)
nodes solA and solB I get the following
results, depending on which node is the
nfs-server and which two nodes try a con-
current flock (ok means, the second node
does not get an exclusive file lock).
nfs-server nfs-lock-1 nfs-lock-2 result
lnxA       lnxA       lnxA           ok
lnxA       lnxA       lnxB       not ok
lnxA       lnxA       solA       not ok
lnxA       solA       solB           ok
solA       solA       solB           ok
solA       solA       lnxA       not ok
solA       lnxA       lnxB       not ok
solA       lnxA       lnxA           ok
To me these results appear quite strange.
Do experts expect this behaviour and is there
a way of getting four "ok"'s for either
an linux or solaris nfs server?
Any more input required? Any tests I can
perform?
Thanks,
Ruben
