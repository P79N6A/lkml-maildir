I still don't understand the current obsession with this stuff.
It is easy to have pid_max 2^30 and a fast algorithm that does not
take any more kernel space.
It seems to me you are first creating an unrealistic and unfavorable
situation (put pid_max at some artificially low value, starting a
lot of tasks and saying: look! the algorithm is quadratic!) and
then solve the problem that you thus invented yourself.
Please leave pid_max large.
