It's a valuable lesson to us that the sched_yield() issue is one we should be 
suspicious of. I'm very happy that it performs well for you once the coding 
is corrected.

It probably hits that code path less frequently in slower cpus ironically.

The sched_yield issue is noted in faqs, but it should be highlighted in the 
interactivity section.

No, thank you for tracking this down fully. No amount of reassuring that it's 
not 2.6's fault will suffice for us unless we can find the real cause and 
solutions for these issues.
