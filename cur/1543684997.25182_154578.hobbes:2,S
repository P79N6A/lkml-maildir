This is not true. VMware modules are open source, they are just non-GPL.
And no, it is impossible to avoid them. At least nobody I know knows how
to avoid them.
There is only known problem (fixed in 
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/vmware/vmware-any-any-update38.tar.gz
) that
SuSE backported epoll patches from 2.5.x to both 2.4.19 and 2.4.20, and
while this seriously changes poll_initwait semantic, it caused only
warning at compile time, but at runtime it was corrupting kernel
stack. But I do not see epoll patches in 2.4.22pre10, so it must
be something else.
