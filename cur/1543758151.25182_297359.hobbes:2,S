Subject: [PATCH] Keys: Doc update for properly sharing process keyrings patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/2/25/66

The attached patch updates the documentation on the kernel keys to reflect the
fact that process keyrings will no longer change ownership when the UID and
GID of a thread change; process's don't have UIDs and GIDs in Linux, only
threads do.
This patch is contingent on the keyring sharing patch submitted a few minutes
ago.
