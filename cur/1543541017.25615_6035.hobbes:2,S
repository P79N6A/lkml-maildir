Like I said in other message, when the patch was peer-reviewed by David
Miller, I've only sent those two extra messages, where I say "I've sent
this patch to Linus", after sending to this list, where I've received
comments from Andrew Morton, David Miller and Linus, because a ml
server (the samba.org one) said that the first message, to this list,
was reject because it had more than 40000 bytes. So yes, I agree with
you, that's why I've sent it to peer review first.
