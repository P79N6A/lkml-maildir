UCS-2 - I can't keep this stuff straight.

With no iocharset specified, a filename with such a character will be
inaccessible.  Probably the best thing for readdir to do is to
substitute a '?' and print a message to the syslog to mount the volume
with iocharset=utf8 to be able to access the file.  Of course I would
limit the number of printk's to something small.  I'll submit a patch to
do this.
