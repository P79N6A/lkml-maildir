	Well, that's what coding standards and managers are for.

	Yes, except we have 38 years to finish it. :)

	Agreed. I'm not suggesting we change time_t any time soon. In fact, I'm
arguing against the people suggesting that we need to modify time_t ASAP.

	I see your point. That would have the benefit of not breaking anything, and
allowing us to easily write programs _today_ that will work past Y2.038K
without a recompile.

	Right. That's why I don't think we should change 'time_t' anytime soon. But
we should still write programs that correctly treat 'time_t' as an opaque
type. That way, these programs can be made Y2.038K compliant with a
recompile when the time comes.

	Yeah, I guess I see your point. Perhaps over the next 5 years or so we can
draft, implement, and deploy a new timing standard that will last us
thousands of years, with new types and functions. Then we can all code to
that in 2010, and we'll all be ready for 2038 without a problem.
	A compile or library switch to keep those types to 32-bits on 32-bit
architectures would be nice too. That way, people could write code that's
Y2.038K compliant with a recompile with no performance penalty.
	FWIW, there are plenty of applications today that need to process times
over a larger range than 'time_t' supports. It would be nice just to have
one standard set of time routines, ideally portable across platforms.
