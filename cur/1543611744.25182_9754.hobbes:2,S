I'd say it is better because the mutations themselves (individual patches)
go through a _very_ harsh evaluation before being applied in the "official"
sources. There is a population of kernels out there (each developer has a
few, distributions check out others, ...), only what survives there has got
a chance to be considered for inclusion.
Sure, this is not the only way Linux moves forward. But it is a large
factor in the success of "Release early. Release often. Take patches from
everywhere."
