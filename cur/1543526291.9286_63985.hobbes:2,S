Hi,
You complained about KERN_ERR stuff but didn't notice duplicate return
-EINVAL :) (how did it get there?)

it is a standard, called New Linux Kernel Coding Standard :)
Didn't you know that after James Manning's patches were accepted, using
structure name tags is the preferred way?
Thanks for reviewing it - there is lots of cleanup. I will send it in
the next bunch to Linus. Also, I am adding support to update the size of
microcode file to num_cpu*2048 if update has taken place and fill it up
with arrays of struct microcode elements selected for update, i.e. one
can always check exactly what went into the CPUs.
Also, I need to make it devfs-aware.
Regards,
Tigran.
