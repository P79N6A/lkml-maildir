Oops.  I was looking at the graphs for Moe but 
<

 doesn't appear to be 
demonstrating a problem either.  Given the fluctuation in the 2.6.16-rc1 
results (235, 234, 211, 228.5 and 237.5), the results for 2.6.16-rc1-mm1 
(229) and 2.6.16-mm2 (219) aren't significantly different.

PS I have a modification for kernbench that calculates and displays the 
standard deviations for the various averages if you're interested.  This 
would enable you to display 95% (say) confidence bars on the graphed 
results which in turn makes it easier to spot significant differences.
