All these wait_for_cmd_done timeout issues look very much like new (or
previously unknown) timing constraints in new onboard chips.
It isn't completely power management-related.
Donald fixed one of such issues several months ago, which I primarily
observed on i82559ER.
Apparently, it's another one.  The chip gets stuck and stops to process
commands.
For a lot of people inserting `udelay(1);' inside wait_for_cmd_done loop
helped, not because it's right to make the delay, but because it changes
timing and introduces minimal 1usec delay even if the chip is ready almost
instantly :-(
Best regards
