According to a gcc developer to whom I asked this question, volatile
prevents the code
to be removed, but does not prevent it to be moved (pun indented). In
practice, it should force
a re-read, but not influence the ordering decisions from the compiler.
Besides , 'significantly'
sounds like a significantly unprecise word, whose specific meaning may
be implementation dependant.
So I agree that adding a memory location reference is probably the best
alternative.
