I found this patch usefull in my testings, but had a feeling something
was not complete. If the goal is to reduce number of splice() calls,
we also should reduce number of wakeups. If splice() is used in non
blocking mode, nothing we can do here of course, since the application
will use a poll()/select()/epoll() event before calling splice(). A
good setting of SO_RCVLOWAT to (16*PAGE_SIZE)/2 might improve things.
I tested this on current tree and it is not working : we still have
one wakeup for each frame (ethernet link is a 100 Mb/s one)
bind(6, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(4711), sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = 0
listen(6, 5)                            = 0
accept(6, 0, NULL)                      = 7
setsockopt(7, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVLOWAT, [32768], 4) = 0
poll([{fd=7, events=POLLIN, revents=POLLIN|POLLERR|POLLHUP}], 1, -1) = 1
splice(0x7, 0, 0x4, 0, 0x10000, 0x3)    = 1024
splice(0x3, 0, 0x5, 0, 0x400, 0x5)      = 1024
poll([{fd=7, events=POLLIN, revents=POLLIN|POLLERR|POLLHUP}], 1, -1) = 1
splice(0x7, 0, 0x4, 0, 0x10000, 0x3)    = 1460
splice(0x3, 0, 0x5, 0, 0x5b4, 0x5)      = 1460

About tcp_recvmsg(), we might also remove the "!timeo" test as well,
more testings are needed. But remind that if an application provides
a large buffer to tcp_recvmsg() call, removing the test will reduce
the number of syscalls but might use more DCACHE. It could reduce
performance on old cpus. With splice() call, we expect to not
copy memory and trash DCACHE, and pipe buffers being limited to 16,
we cope with a limited working set.
