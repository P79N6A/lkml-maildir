Should that have been:
obj-$(CONFIG_ACPI_INTERPRETER) := dsfield.o   dsmthdat.o  dsopcode.o...
Looks wrong to me that you remove the CONFIG_ dependency.
Same is true for the rest of this cset.

Since kbuild no longer support list-multi this should be $(error ....)

Here is list-multi removed.

I prefer first assignment to be := not +=
This is true for several places including several makefiles as well.

Did not see this change justified.

This change result in ld being called for directories like:
$(TOPDIR)/scripts
$(TOPDIR)/scripts/lxdialog
$(TOPDIR)/Documentation/DocBook
If obj-y is empty then do not define O_TARGET?
Another more general comment.
There seem to no consistency in the variables used in the first section of
the makefile. There is a mixture of lower and upper case variables:
O_TARGET, host-progs etc. This is confusing.
Furthermore the construct:
obj-y := some.o dot.o .o module.o
Seems illogical to me. What does obj-y mean to me??
mandatory-objs := some.o dot.o .o module.o
It a litte longer, but occur only once (typical) per makefile.
Thats not something I propose for now, more to be seen as a general comment
about striving for consistency in the interface to rules.make.

Where comes the requirement that EXTRA_TARGETS needs to be buildin?

Keep a variable without obj appended would make this readable I think.
Now it's testing time..
