Hi list,
here are a bunch of cleanup patches. they dont fix a real problem they
simply clean the use of pid. pid should be of type pid_t to allow different
architectures a different choise (and they do). In programms we found the
use from signed to unsigned and from int to long. So daniele bellucci and i
wrote to a several maintainers for cleanup i am happy to see that several
patches got applied.                                          
greetings
walter
