Matt,
I may be wrong; but I think request_firmware(&fw, NAME , device)  will
create an entry /sys/firmware/NAME/(loading,data).
You can simply download the firmware by doing 
echo 1 > /sys/firmware/NAME/loading
cat rbu.image > /sys/firmware/NAME/data.
After this is done request_firmware returns and the image can be
actually 
copied to the device using fw->data and fw-size. 
Once this is complete the fw can be released.
Not sure why do I need a firmware image file in /lib/firmware?
Thanks,
Abhay
