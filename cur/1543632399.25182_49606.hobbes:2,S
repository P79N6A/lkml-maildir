truncate and write change i_size, under i_sem.   The i_size test on
the read path doesn't really need to be there, I suspect.  It handles
the window where i_size has been decreased by truncate but the filesystem
hasn't finished truncating the blocks yet.  It also optimises reads
outside the end of file - no point in calling into the filesystem
to try to map blocks which aren't there.

That's true.  sys_stat() also could see a confusing intermediate value.
A while back Ingo and Linus were tossing around possible solutions to
this based on x86 compare-and-exchange operations, but nothing conclusive
came out of it.   It's a "known bug".
