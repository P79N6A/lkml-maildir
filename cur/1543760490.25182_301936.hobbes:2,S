Andi Kleen (iirc) says that non-temporal stores seem to be
big win in microbenchmarks (and I second that), but they are
a net loss when we are going to use zeroed page just after
zeroing. He recommends avoid using non-temporal stores
With this new page prezeroing infrastructure, that argument
most likely is not right anymore. Especially clearing of
high-order pages definitely will benefit from NT stores
because they do not kill L1 data cache in the process.
I don't have K8 and therefore cannot be 100% sure, but
I really doubt that K8 optimize "rep stosq" into _NT_ stores.
Andi?
