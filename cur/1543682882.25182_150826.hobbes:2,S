Actually it was 1A, I was just looking to see if there was a wli release
there, since the responsiveness has been so good. Far better than mine
taking two days to check the version and get back to you.
Since it's not released, don't worry too much, test1-ac2 has been stable
enough for some testing, and it's not overly slow even on the tiny machine
I'm using for test. I'll try again when/if you release, or you can try
with the config I attached to the original.
