Subject: [PATCH 00 of 23] struct file: Use struct path
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The struct file changes in the following patches were suggested by Al Viro
during the discussion of struct path almost a week ago.
The first patch changes struct file to use struct path instead of just
having struct dentry and struct vfsmount pointers.
The remaining patches change several filesystem, the kernel/ and mm/
directories, as well as the i386 and x86_64 arch code.
These patches depend on the struct path patches from October 18th already in
-mm.
