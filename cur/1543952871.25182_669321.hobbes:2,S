Yeah, even though I'd call that very broken, I wouldn't like to go
auditing filesystems for such breakage.

But then we lose the ability to later extend the format by adding
fields at the end.  Which is one of the things that would be nice to
have, in contrast to /proc/mounts, which we are so afraid to touch now.
So maybe some alternative, multi line format would be better?
MountID: 99
ParentID: 88
DevID: 0:34
Type: foofs
Source: /dev/foo
Root: /
MountPoint: /mnt/foo
MountOpts: rw,noatime
Opts: rw,errors=continue
Propagation: shared:42
