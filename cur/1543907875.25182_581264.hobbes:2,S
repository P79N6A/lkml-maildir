Some MMU-related PV techiniques (including Xen, and direct paging mode
for Xen/KVM) need to write-protect page tables, avoiding to use 2MB
pages when mapping page tables. Looks like you did not, and that
exaplains why the patches are missing the relevant (many) paravirt_ops
in include/asm-x86_64/pgalloc.h, for example, compared with the i386
tree.
