Clean?  Hardly.  It breaks up code paths that were never written to be 
broken up.  The proper fix is to locate and fix high latency code paths. 
  Preempt does nothing but hide those high latency code paths, and 
discourage people from seeking a better solution.
Fix the drivers, rather than bandaid over them with preempt.
If all code paths in the kernel were low latency, then you would not 
need preempt at all.
