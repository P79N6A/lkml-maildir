Subject: How does one use the new ppp modules (2.3.13) ? (and other problems)

I have installed pppd-2.3.9 ( the very latest I could find ). It just
informs me that my kernel has no ppp. So I added "alias ppp ppp_generic" 
to /etc/conf.modules, this did not help. I went and added back ppp.o to
MX_OBJS in drivers/net/Makefile. Now pppd loads ppp.o, but this doesn't
seem right ? Anyway there seems to be no info in the sources or the
newsgroups, mailing list etc. It sure would be nice if some documentation
of these sort of changes made it into the Documentation directory.

P.S. scsi.c doesn't compile as a module, there needs to be some "#ifndef
MODULE"'s near the lines that look like "__setup(...)", and somewhere
"EXPORT_SYMBOL(init_task_union);" need to be added.
