Great Day,
My name is Sgt. Jonathan Fitte, I am an American soldier, I am serving 
in the military of the 1st Armored Division in Iraq, As you know we are 
being attacked by insurgents everyday and car bombs.We managed to move 
funds belonging to Saddam Hussien's family. The total amount is US$25 
Million dollars in cash, mostly 100 dollar bills. We want to move this 
money to you, so that you may invest it for us and keep our share for 
banking.
We will take 50%, my partner and I. You take the other 50%. no strings 
attached, just help us move it out of Iraq, Iraq is a warzone. We plan 
on using diplomatic courier and shipping the money out in one large 
silver box, using diplomatic immunity.
If you are interested I will send  you the full details, my job is to 
find a good partner that we can trust and that will assist us. Can I 
trust you? When you receive this letter,kindly send me an e-mail 
signifying your interest including your most confidential telephone/fax numbers 
for quick communication also your contact details. This business is 
risk free. The box can be shipped out in 48hrs.
Note : Contact me through this my official email

Respectfully, 
Sgt. Jonathan Fitte
