The patch 04fbfdc14e5f48463820d6b9807daa5e9c92c51f implemented bdi per
device dirty threshold. It works well.
However, the period for proportion calculation may be too large.
For 8G memory, the calc_period_shift() will return 19 as the shift.
When we switch writing operation between different disks, there may be
potential performance issue.
For example, we first write to disk A, then write to disk B.
The proportion for disk B will increase slowly because the denominator
is too large (It's 2^18 + (global_count & counter_mask)).
The disk B will get small dirty page quota for a long time,
it will get blocked frequently though the total dirty page is under the
dirty page limit.
Peter provided a patch to avoid this issue, this patch allow violation
of bdi limits if there is a lot of room on the system.
It looks like:
+if (nr_reclaimable + nr_writeback < (background_thresh +
dirty_thresh) / 2)
+                     break; 
This patch really help to avoid congestion, but if the dirty pages
exceed about 3/4 of the dirty_thresh, congestion still happens if we
write to another disk. 
I think that we can reduce the period to speed up the proportion
adjustment.

In the 8G memory system, I did some testing with iozone.
I found that reducing the period help to increase the write speed 
when switch to a new disk.
Run  "./iozone -B -i 0 -i 2 -r 4k -s 1000M" twice in the disk B.
