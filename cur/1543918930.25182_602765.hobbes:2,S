Speaking of over, this does not fly at all. If you call panic(),
for whatever reason you want, then the printk() is the last thing
that happens after that, you can declare userspace dead.
On oopses, it depends on their severity. Eventually procfs goes
whoops and the kmsg transmission mechanism does not work, and oh,
userspace can't help it.
