I agree. For a better future:

 Remember: if another thread can find your data structure, and you don't
 have a reference count on it, you almost certainly have a bug.

+
+		Chapter 9: Typedefs
+
+You should avoid using typedefs. It's not a hard rule but it's fairly 
+common to use an explicit "struct xxxx" instead of "xxxx_t".
+
+Hiding the fact that it's a struct causes bad things if people don't
+realize it: allocating structs on the stack is something you should be
+aware of (and careful with), and passing them as parameters is is much
+better done explicitly as a "pointer to struct".
+
+There are _some_ exceptions. For example, "pte_t" etc might well be a
+struct on most architectures, and that's ok: it's expressly designed to be
+an opaque (and still fairly small) thing. This is an example of where
+there are clear _reasons_ for the abstraction, not just abstraction for
+its own sake.
+
+For example, some people like to do things like: 
+
+ /* BAD!!! */    typedef unsigned int counter_t;    /* BAD!!! */
+
+and then use "counter_t" all over the place. I think that's not just ugly,
+but stupid and counter-productive. It makes it much harder to do things
+like "printk()" portably, for example ("should I use %u, %l or just %d?"),
+and generally adds no value. It only _hides_ information, like whether the
+type is signed or not.
+
+There is nothing wrong with just using something like "unsigned long"
+directly, even if it is a few characters longer than you might like. And
+if you care about the number of bits, use "u32" or something. Don't make
+up useless types that have no added advantage.

P.S.
list_t was added between 2.5.1-pre9 and 2.5.1-pre10, when you applied 
Ingo's scalable scheduler code. Since then it gained a few users: device.h, 
fs.h, sched.h, and mm.h. It can be kicked out easily.
