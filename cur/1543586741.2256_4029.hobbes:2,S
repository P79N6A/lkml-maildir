Perhaps. But,
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
is about the most ominous message one can receive from the IDE driver:
1. it's not in English, so it doesn't tell you jack
2. it's usually a sign of "mkfs + reinstall needed"
3. I've had it happen on Intel and VIA chipsets alike, 100% guaranteed
   non-overclocked
4. Andre has repeatedly claimed "he's fixed it", but experience in the
   field shows quite the contrary to be true
5. I have yet to see a coherent explanation from Andre as to what the
   message means, or what causes it.
So right now 2.4 + IDE (or 2.2 + IDE + Andre's patches) is not a combination 
I can trust my data to, unless everything is running in PIO mode. The latter
is usually way too slow for anything useful, other than maybe a pure router.
