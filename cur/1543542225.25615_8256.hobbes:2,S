We use POSIX threads in RTLinux as an API. We've found that if you are
sufficiently careful about making sensible decisions where POSIX allows
leeway, the result is quite simple and clear. Of course, we 
supply the "main" routine, allowing us to simplify "as if the main
routine did X". But POSIX is generally pretty careful about what a
conforming application has a right to expect and I think it is
perfectly reasonable to refuse to assist non-conforming applications
with wacky designs.
