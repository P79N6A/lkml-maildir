I did memcpy() changes in some initial post (take '2', I think). That
caused some _correctness_ issue in de/compressor code -- Bret's test
could not succeed on ppc machine. After going back to byte-by-byte
copying, his tests were successful.
So, it's better not to include such changes now or test on all
supported archs if you really want to do so :)

Yes, memcpy() changes have potential of giving significant perf gain
but I am not too sure if memcpy() will be good if we want to copy just
few bytes (which is the case at many times in de/compressor). Also, at
some places, memcpy() changes are not trival and have actually caused
correctness issues as mentioned above.
So, before this change, it will be good if it gets merged in mainline
and tested, at least for correctness, on all supported achs. All the
while, we will have a good feeling that there is still a good scope
for perf improvement :)
Cheers,
Nitin
