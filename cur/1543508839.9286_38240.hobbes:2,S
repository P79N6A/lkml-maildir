I downloaded the text (24281603.pdf) you refered to,
but I think you read the wrong appendix:
APPENDIX A and B are for the Pentium CPU,
APPENDIX C and D are for the Pentium Pro.
I'm not 100% sure, but afaik the Pentium II is based on the PPro core,
i.e. no U-pipe, V-pipe, but my-ops.
Unfortunately, there is a typo in "2.3.2 Pentium II processor"
[if you try to follow the link to "Section 2.3" then you'll die in a few
seconds due to a stack overrun:->, only 2.2 or 2.1 are possible answers]
But OTHO, there is a remark below the following table:
"Note: See notes following table 2.1"
And the table 2.1 is in section 2.2.1: "Pentium Pro Execution Units"
