Yeah, I think the problem is exacerbated for me by the fact the streaming 
boxes have 5 cards each... so thats 5 kernel threads, so five times more 
likely for it to happen. As you say, it only occurs when starting/stopping 
streaming. Normal playback is rock solid.
Please let me know if it fixes it.. be good to know if this is definitely the 
issue.
