We do use the EM_xxx number space but that isn't sufficient to
distinguish between 32-bit and 64-bit incarnations of certain machine
types (S390,SH,MIPS,...). I didn't much like adding it either, but
couldn't see a better option.
I pondered strings but we want to filter on this and don't want to have
to use strcmp. Got any better answers?
