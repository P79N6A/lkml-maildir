Subject: [PATCH] autofs4 - need to invalidate children on tree mount expire

Hi Andrew,
I've found a case where invalid dentrys in a mount tree, waiting to be 
cleaned up by d_invalidate, prevent the expected expire.
In this case dentrys created during a lookup for which a mount fails or 
has no entry in the mount map contribute to the d_count of the parent 
dentry. These dentrys may not be invalidated prior to comparing the 
interanl usage count of valid autofs dentrys against the dentry d_count 
which makes a mount tree appear busy so it doesn't expire.
