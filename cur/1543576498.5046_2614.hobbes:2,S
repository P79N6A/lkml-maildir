Now, now, I'd love to se reports of expecially the new updated compiler. 
I've not actually seen a single report of problems for the kernel even
with the old 2.96, it's just that I've seen too many user-space problems
that I would be hesitant to use it for the kernel. 
Despite my dislike of releasing snaopshot compilers, I'd _much_ rather
see Red Hat just dropping their "kgcc" thing, and in order to do that
people do ned to test with the new compiler. 
I just want people to mention the fact, so that I can correlate any
bug-reports with a compiler version. Just in case. It can be important
(and not just because of compiler bugs, but due to real kernel bugs that
just were hidden by pure luck with other compilers). And it helps a LOT
if you have another compiler available to compare with.
