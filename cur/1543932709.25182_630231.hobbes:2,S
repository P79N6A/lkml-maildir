This is excellent observation by Matthew and James. There is no magic
in bugzilla not being loved, it is just "not the right set of features
for effective work on a problem". It doesn't support multiple
developer' collaboration well.
This distaste is not universal, since some people don't have a problem
with bugzilla as is, maybe those who tend to work on problems
"alone"...
But making it to be a workable tool for everyone is definitely worth it.
Any other favorite bugzillas that are nice to work with and that have
the advantage above?
