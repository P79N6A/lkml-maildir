Yes, i was suspecting that the arp cache got full, but i will try
increasing it :)
Would there be any huge bugs if i change these lines in arp.c:
        .gc_thresh1 =   128,
        .gc_thresh2 =   512,
to
        .gc_thresh1 =   700,
        .gc_thresh2 =   700,
under the definition for struct arp_tbl?
This setup will only run for about 1-2 hours while we fix the hardware
router (it is running now, but only on a backup flash card solution.
the harddrive in it died ;)
I have been looking at arpd, but i quickly discarded it as an option
since its marked both experimental and obsolete ;)
