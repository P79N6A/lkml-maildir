It seems to follow from your discussion that if I have a mounted filesystem
on a USB device and I suspend to disk, I can lose data unless the filesystem
has been mounted with "sync".
If this is the case, there should be a big fat warning in the swsusp
documentation, but there's nothing like that in there (at lease I can't find
it easily).
[If this is not the case, I've missed something and sorry for the noise.]
Greetings,
Rafael
