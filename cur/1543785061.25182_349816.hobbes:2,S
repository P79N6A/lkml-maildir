If you look at RCU change, you discover they impact read()/write()/... (no 
more locking), but not open()/dup()/socket() and close() that still take a 
spinlock to modify the state.
And if your process has many files opened, the cost (read : latency) of open() 
can be very high, finding a zero bit in a large bit array.
So these RCU changes can help some benchmarks (or real apps... ;-) ), but not 
some others :)
I wish a process param could allow open() to take any free fd available, not 
the lowest one. One can always use fcntl(fd, F_DUPFD, slot) to move a fd on a 
specific high slot and always keep the 64 first fd slots free to speedup the 
kernel part at open()/dup()/socket() time.
