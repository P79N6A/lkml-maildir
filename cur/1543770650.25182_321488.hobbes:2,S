Before I get any egg on my face by returning this disk, I am asking the
IDE gurus opinion. I'm also sorry for bothering lkml.
I'm running FedoraCore 2 on a Alpha LX164 box with 512M RAM. The on
board IDE chip won't handle current IDE so I purchased a HighPoint
Rocket133 and a Maxtor 120G drive. On boot, the kernel panics after
probing the drive reporting "INVALID HEADS" etc. I then gave the kernel
hde=noprobe option via SRM to boot the system after adding "alias
block-major-33 ide-probe" to /etc/modprobe.conf. While fsdisk /dev/hde
reports "unable to read /dev/hde", hdparm -I reports the following:
/dev/hde:
ATA device, with non-removable media
        Model Number:       Maxtor CALYPSO
        Firmware Revision:  YAR43KJZ
Standards:
        Likely used: 1
Configuration:
        fixed drive
        Logical         max     current
        cylinders       0       0
        heads           0       0
        sectors/track   0       0
        --
        device size with M = 1024*1024:           0 MBytes
        device size with M = 1000*1000:           0 MBytes
Capabilities:
        IORDY not likely
        Cannot perform double-word IO
        R/W multiple sector transfer: not supported
        DMA: not supported
        PIO: pio0
I'm not familiar with IDE at all. I have always used SCSI. However, my
SCSI disk is full and I'm short of money.
My current opinion is the disk is bad. Could an expert please confirm
this or please tell me how to fix it? Sorry, printed on the disk is: LBA
240121728 which, I presume, is the total sectors.
Thanks in advance.
