update: I'm no longer sure that it's a kernel problem in my case.
after reducing the CPU clock from 450 to 400 MHz I've now compiled
>2*100 kernels using 2.2.10 with no single problem at all.
so maybe it was just a hardware problem for me -- or it's some weird race 
which doesn't show up for 400 but only for 450 MHz ?!  I can't believe that yet...
