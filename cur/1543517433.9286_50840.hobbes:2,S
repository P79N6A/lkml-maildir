Slow, perhaps, but it's probably the only way to preserve proper buffer
cache semantics now given the fancy tricks with moving blocks in memory
that the filesystem layers are playing.

Yes.

That should work, *if* you are sure that there are no other users of the
old buffer_head at the time.  You'd have to take the appropriate buffer
cache spinlock to make sure of that.
