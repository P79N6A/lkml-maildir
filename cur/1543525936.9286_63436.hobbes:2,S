In Alan's TODO list, I noticed
  ACPI hangs on boot for some systems
Can anyone that is experiencing this problem
please let me know?  The fastest route to a
fix would be to grab and build the acpitools
from
  
http://phobos.fs.tum.de/acpi/acpitools-111899.tar.gz
and then mail me the output of "./acpidmp"
(No, obviously ACPI support doesn't need to be
in the kernel for acpidmp to work, but it
does need to be run as root)
I can't guarantee a fix if the problem is
hardware/BIOS but I can, at the very least, disable
ACPI on systems that are having problems.
Thank you,
Andy
