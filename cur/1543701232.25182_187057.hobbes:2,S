How does your initrd look like?
What boot loader do you use?
I wrote an initrd myself some time ago that works very well (for me).
It's only a simle x86 one, but I think the binaries could be replaced
with the opteron ones. I just copied the binaries from my own (also
Gentoo) system and stripped them.
You can find it here:
http://www.saout.de/misc/initrd-2.6.0-lvm2-athlon.gz
(there's also a small README in that directory)
gunzip it and
mount initrd-2.6.0-lvm2-athlon /mnt -o loop
Then you can go in there and replace the binaries (some libraries in
/lib, /bin and /sbin).
/bin/sh is a small shell called "ash" (which can also be emerged). udev
is used when no devfs is available.
You can try playing with that one until someone writes a script.
It doesn't contain a module loader so device-mapper and ext3 should be
compiled into the kernel.
You should create a directory called /initrd on your root volume and
pass root=/path/to/volume to the kernel (instead of the numeric
root=fe00), then the script will try to mount the root volume itself and
pivot_root to it which will work better because LVM2 uses dynamic
minors.
Good luck. :)
