I wonder whether we should be using similar check in generic path too.
We have quite a few cases where MWDMA ATAPI devices choking on commands
with small transfer sizes.  I don't think we'll experience significant
performance regression with this applied and even if there is some, it's
far better to have slightly slower working device.
What do you guys think?
