Very good idea, but maybe, at least for some time, it should be with
ifdef CONFIG_4KSTACKS, to check if it's really needed if some other
similar checks also set.

Maybe there should be some min 'free' and max number of printks? There
could be also considered if, with some minimal values of 'free', prink
is the best thing we can do before stack overruning?

Isn't a MAGIC number better for this? (Then of course above n should
start a bit higher.)
