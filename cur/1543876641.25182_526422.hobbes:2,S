Yes, something like this would be necessary to handle TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
tasks.  _Still_, currently we just fail the freezing if there are
uninterruptible tasks, because they can hold locks and may potentially
deadlock with device drivers' .suspend() or .resume() routines (please remember
that the freezer is used for suspending in the first place :-)).
I think we can freeze uninterruptible tasks for the CPU hotplug, but we should
avoid freezing them for the suspend.

We can catch them while we're freezing kernel threads (provided that the kernel
threads themselves aren't forking like mad, but this doesn't seem to happen in
practice).
