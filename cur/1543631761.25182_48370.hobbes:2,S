For the CONFIG_<<cputype>> options, is it only gcc compiler-type settings that 
are affected? I thought the assembly parts of the kernel were also switched on 
occasion.
I was wondering whether anyone has checked that these assembly snippets were 
decently optimal for the cpu type selected...

Be careful about 'knowing better' than compilers. I really don't want to start
a flamefest, but modern compilers are very good at doing all sorts of
optimisations, and hand-coded 'optimisations' can _sometimes_ actually hurt
performance over the unadorned version of the code. It is sensible to prove 
that the source-level optimisation helps, and then to mark it as such, so as 
compilers change it can be reviewed.
