Only if you have two, which must be closely related to each other (i.e.
each request  must have network reserve big enough to store data).

With or without vm deadlock patches? I can not see how it can work, if
network does not have a reserve and there is not free memory completely.
If all systems have reserve then yes, it works good.

Actually we only care about if there is a place in the queue or not - so
it can be a flag. Actually non-atomic operations are ok, since having
plus/minus couple of requests in flight does not change the picture, but
allows not to introduce slow atomic operations in the fast path.

Yes, it can be bio vectors.

We can demand that reserve is not per virtual device, but per real one -
for example in case of distributed storage locally connected node should
have much higher limit than network one, but having a per-virtual device
reserve might end up with situation, when local node can proceed data,
but no requests will be queued sine all requests below limit are in
network node. In case of per real device limit there is no need to
increase bio.
