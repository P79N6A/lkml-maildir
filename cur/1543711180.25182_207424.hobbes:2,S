how about adding a new syscall, sys_sched_get_affinity_span(), which
would be called by glibc first time one of the affinity syscalls are
called.
This syscall would be a prime target to be optimized away via the
vsyscall DSO, so there's no overhead worry.
something like the attached patch.
or, maybe it would be better to introduce some sort of 'system
constants' syscall that would be a generic umbrella for such things -
and could easily be converted into a vsyscall. Or we could make it part
of the .data section of the VDSO - thus no copying overhead, only one
symbol lookup.
