Hi....
First of all, thanks for oprofile !
It's the first tool I can really use to profile my app, with a ton of
dynamically loaded plugins and without having to link everything
statically...
But, it there any sane way to use it as non-root user ?
Is there any alternative ?
I'm even thinking of suid'ing opcontrol.
I tried sysprof, but it locks the machine as soon as I load the module.
I use the latest -mm kernel.
Any ideas ?
TIA
