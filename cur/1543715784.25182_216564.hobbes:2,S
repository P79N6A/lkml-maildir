Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

To test the benefit of Mingming's ext3 reservation
patchset, we ran tiobench on 2-way systems on STP
using 2.6.6-rc2-mm1 versus 2.6.6-rc2-mm1 patched to
force the ext3 file system to be built without
reservation.
The results show increased throughput for >1
threads not only for sequential write, but also
for random write, sequential read, and random read.
Latency is also decreased for all cases.
Raw data can be found:
-2 way 2.6.6-rc2-mm1

-2 way 2.6.6-rc2-mm1  noreservation default
http://khack.osdl.org/stp/292225/results/tiobench-ext3.txt
Judith compared the two runs by plotting the
results at:

Here are some interesting ones:
Thruput results:
-Random write thruput 128k

-Random write thruput 4k

-Sequential write thruput 4k

-Sequential write thruput 128k

Latency is reduced almost across the board.
