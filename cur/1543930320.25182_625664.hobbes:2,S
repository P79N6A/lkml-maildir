argh.  OK.  And Linus's current tree is OK, yes?
In which case we should be OK for 2.6.24 and I guess we can hope like heck
that the dud patch doesn't leak into mainline.  Hopefully Alan will get
some time to look into it before 2.6.25 opens.
<looks>
OK, there's a patch in Jeff's tree "pata_pcmcia: Add support for dumb 8bit
IDE emulations" which could be our guy.
I've uploaded two patches, against 2.6.24-rc4:
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/zl.with.gz
	origin.patch + git-libata-all.patch
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/zl.without.gz
	origin.patch + git-libata-all.patch - 5ddcddd4dfeb16a9509dad647f509828d6fee605
It would be great if you could test both.  If zl.with is bad and zl.without
is good then we know that 5ddcddd4dfeb16a9509dad647f509828d6fee605 caused
this problem.
Thanks.
