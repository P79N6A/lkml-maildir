           Summary: host controller halted after unplugging usb mouse
    Kernel Version: 2.5.65
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: greg@kroah.com
         Submitter: kc0@hotmail.com
Distribution: Debian sid, kernel 2.5.65
Hardware Environment: toshiba satellite pro 6100
Software Environment: debian hotplug package Version: 0.0.20030117-4
Problem Description: This laptop has 2 USB ports. At boot time the mouse was
already plugged in in one of the ports. Works fine. Then I unplugged it and put
it in the other port. The mouse didn't work, so I unplugged it again and put it
back in the port where it was plugged in at boottime. Now the mouse works again.
So it's not really bothering me, but it's still a bug to report.
This is what I found in the logs:
[After stripping the usual: atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scan.... errors ]
usb 1-1: USB disconnect, address 2
drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: can't resubmit intr, 00:1d.0-1/input0, status -19
drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c: efe0: host controller halted. very bad

IntelliEye(TM)] on usb-00:1d.0-1
