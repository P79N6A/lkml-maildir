Hi all,
I'm experiencing hangs with 2.4.23-pre kernels when using the network with 
the said driver. The last kernel that works is the 2.4.22-pre8. I noticed 
that during this versions there where updates to the eth. drivers. 
Unfortunately the kernel does not give any error, just the pc does not 
respond to pings, the cursor on screen stops blinking. Tried with sysrq 
enabled too but nothing on logs. I can reliabily reproduce this just doing 
something network intensive, eg. accessing a remote desktop during a full 
kernel download ;)
Sorry for this terse info, if you need any other info just ask. And please CC 
me on replies as I'm not subscribed to the list.
Thanks,
Fredi
