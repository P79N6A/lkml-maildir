I don't use modem_run any more, but when I did (with the userspace driver), I 
would not get any errors whatsoever. It didn't reconnect automatically, 
however.
I'll try enabling USB_DEBUG next time I upgrade that machine's kernel. 
Unfortunately I don't have access to it at the moment (but will within the 
week).
Thanks for the help so far!
