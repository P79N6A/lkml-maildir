Subject: question about creating char device in 2.4

A coworker of mine had created a character device for 2.2 and is now 
looking into porting it forward to 2.4 but he's running into some issues 
with the new generic io code.
Basically he impemented a virtual device that had a fixed amount of 
buffer space.  You could write to/read from that storage space as usual, 
with the one exception that once it was full you could continue to write 
to it and the writes would succeed.
Basically the ideas was to create something that you could log to and 
only the first x bytes would be logged.  After that the writes would 
still succeed but the data would be thrown away. "cat"ing the file would 
then give you the first x bytes that had been stored.
How would you go about hooking in to the 2.4 char device code to do 
something equivalent?
Thanks,
Chris
