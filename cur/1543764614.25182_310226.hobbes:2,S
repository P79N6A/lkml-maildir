Hi,
I'll look at your scripts this weekend.  I've also been
working on some, but mine are a bit more experimental (cruder)
than yours are.  Anyway, here they are (attached) -- also
available at 
http://developer.osdl.org/rddunlap/git/
gitin : checkin/commit
gitwhat sha1 : what is that sha1 file (type and contents if blob or commit)
gitlist (blob, commit, tree, or all) :
	list all objects with type (commit, tree, blob, or all)
