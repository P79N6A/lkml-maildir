Hi folks,
Does anyone have mboxes for the two bk commits (head and 24) mailing lists,
going back to the beginning? It would be great if you could make these
available somewhere. I asked David, but he doesn't have them. He explained
how to recreate them with BK, but I don't think I qualify for the free license.
David told me
