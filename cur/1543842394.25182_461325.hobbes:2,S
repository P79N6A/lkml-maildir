I do have a problem with a new laptop (Acer Ferrari 4006):
It does suspend either to disk or to ram only when I do boot with
"noapic". So far, so good.
If, however, I do boot with "noapic" no events are delivered to
/proc/acpi/event so lid switch and power button can't be used to suspend
anymore.
The strange thing is, that at least in /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/state I
can view the lid switch state.
Can anybody shed some light on this?
