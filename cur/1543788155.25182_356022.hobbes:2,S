the patch below should solve this. I've added the warning to 
preempt_enable_no_resched() because we had bugs in this area, and i 
wanted to have a chance to review all 'potentially problematic' places.  
So i'm changing them to __preempt_enable_no_resched() when they turn out 
to be safe. (In the future we'll likely remove the debugging message and 
get rid of __preempt_enable_no_resched().)
