I must be dense (entirely possible), but how is that absolute?
If there is no more data in flight after the segment that was lost the 
"stretch ACK" stacks with which I'm familiar will generate the 
standalone ACK within the deferred ACK interval (50 milliseconds). I 
guess that can be the "one extra RTT"  However,  if there is data in 
flight after the point of loss, the immediate ACK upon receipt of out-of 
order data kicks in.

The key there is defining consistent and well spaced.  Certainly an ACK 
only after a window's-worth of data would not be well spaced, but I 
believe that an ACK after more than two full sized frames could indeed 
be well-spaced.

I don't think it is _quite_ that cut and dried, otherwise, HP-UX and 
Solaris, since < 1997 would have had big time problems.
