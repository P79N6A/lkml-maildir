Hmm ok, if you think the container patches is too early for 2.6.23, fine.
We should definitely target to have it in 2.6.24, by which time I am
thinking the memory rss controller will also be in a good shape.

Fine. I will request you to enable group cpu scheduling in
2.6.23-rcX-mmY atleast, so that it gets some amount of testing. The
essential group scheduling bits is already in Linus' tree now (as part
of cfs merge), so what you need in -mm is a slim patch to hook it with Paul's 
container infrastructure (which I trust will continue to be in -mm until it goes
mainline). I will send across that slim patch later (to be included in
2.6.23-rc1-mm1 perhaps).
