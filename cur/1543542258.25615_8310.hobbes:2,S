Numerous apps rely on knowing SIGKILL kills stuff dead. This hack is simply
uglier than handling these few special cases.
Lets be honest SIGSTOP and SIGKILL are not critical fast paths for signals
and with the thread group id Linus proposed we have a chain of tasks for the
thread group so we are talking about adding a chain of code to signal a 
thread group that only has to deal with a few signals
