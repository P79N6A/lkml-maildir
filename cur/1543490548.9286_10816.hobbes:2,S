Not arguing on whether this is a sensible thing to do, but the
functionality the patch in question wants to add has long been in the
kernel. Compile with binfmt_misc enabled and do a
# echo ':foo:M::#!/annoying/path/foo-interpreter::/my/path/to/foo-interpreter:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register 
or e.g.
# echo ':perl:M::#!perl::/usr/bin/perl5:' > ...
if you insist on this feature. Not mentioning what might be done using a
clever wrapper instead of the actual interpreter...
Regards,
Daniel.
