Hello,
as I discovered the NFS-Version 3 isn't yet implemented. I wanted to ask
if someone works on it. I begun myself to modify the mount-command, so
that it can do NFS-Mount-V3. This works already, but is since now an
ugly hack. I will beautify it and wanted to implement NFS-V3 to the
kernel.
If someone already works on the implementation, I would be glad to join
him. As I don't have very much spare-time I can mostly work on weekends,
so that the implementation would last a long time.
But if nobody is writing code for nfs-v3 I would do it.
I also discovered that the implementation of nfs-v2 was done "by hand".
Is there a cause why you don't use rpcgen? I found it usefull to change
the mount to nfs-v3.
Bye
Martin
