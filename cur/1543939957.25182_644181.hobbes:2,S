Subject: [GIT PATCH] driver core fixes against 2.6.24
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/27/259

Here's 5 patches against your current git tree that fix all of the
reported breakages due to the driver core patch merge.
They fix the following issues:
  - build breakage with CONFIG_BLOCK=n
  - strange traceback messages when loading a module that is already
    built into the kernel.
  - ppc vio code build warning and link error fix.
  - oops fix for mce_amd_64 when running on some variants of multi-core
    AMD boxes.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
