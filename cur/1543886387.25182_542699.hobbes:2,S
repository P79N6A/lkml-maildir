Hi Miller,
Thanks for replying.

I think you have not understood my question properly. My problem is, the 
layer above the driver will do
dma_map_single on a kmalloc'ed buffer and passes the result  (bus 
address) to the device driver. Now
the driver has to modify the contents of the the original buffer.
Is it possible to do that ??
-regards,
Mahesh
