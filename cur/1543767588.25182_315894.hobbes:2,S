Certainly would be, but the problem is if you pass in a timespec ts, where
    ts.tv_sec = 10;
    ts.tv_nsec = 99999;
This will overflow a 32-bit nanosecond representation internally
(10000099999 > 4294967296). Sorry for the confusion, the unsigned long
I was referring to was the internal representation of the nanoseconds
converted from the timespec parameter.
Thanks,
Nish
