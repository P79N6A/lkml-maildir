still have fresh memories how everything was renamed and broke

You can have that type of names with devfs, no need to work
around kernel functionality in cdrecord.
On pure IDE hardware that doesn't make sense anyway, in fact
cdrecord mapping is strongly counterintuitive here. 
CD-RW = hdd = bus1,target2 but cdrecord sees it as 0,0,0.

A cure would be nice and I don't see what the kernel could do
to solve this problem as long as cdrecord insists on talking
to the SCSI bus directly.
If nothing else, cdrecord manpage
 - should make a big fat warning about it
 - should stop claiming that it is safe to suid cdrecord
The potential for breakage is huge, people run automounters on CD's,
file managers may try to mount the CD without asking the user.
