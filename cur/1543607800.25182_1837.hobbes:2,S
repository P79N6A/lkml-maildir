no, i'm not taking it as an insult, but yes, they are shorter than 18". 
 i dont have any cables that long, but i wouldnt expect them to work at 
all at ata100 if they were that long....(hence why i figured saying that 
it works in the other OSs was also saying the cables were shorter than 18")

this motherboard is an upgrade.  the old motherboard/ram/processor 
worked fine in all the linux's, as well as freebsd and beos.  i put that 
ram in there (pc133), and i still get dma errors.  i also tried my 
roommate's ddr ram (he used to use linux with it), and still the dma errors.

yeah.  in fact, they were never unplugged (except for obviously from the 
motherboard) until i was testing the cables.

well, when freebsd boots it says a few lines about "Drive C: bios" or 
something like that.  i'm not really very familiar with it.  but no, i 
didnt use any special settings.  its not exactly easy, but i can 
probably get you the first few lines of dmesg if you think it'll help

last i saw, amd rates these chips at 95C, so 57 is downright chilly :)

i'm not sure how to check, and i have a very difficult time even getting 
to a shell in linux, because the damn thing keeps dma erroring about 
reading the cd's.  is there some boot-up settings i can feed it so it 
wont try using dma at all?

i just mentioned timing, because in my (somewhat limited) experience 
writing drivers, timing booboos tend to be the cause of lots of problems 
(especially when timeouts are involved)

again, cant easily get to a command prompt in linux, making things like 
this very difficult :)
i think the best thing is to try and find a startup parameter to prevent 
it from using dma, and see if that works.  anyone know how? :)
