Yes, but if enabling syscall audit, all the syscalls will be audited, so 
every syscall will add overhead, moreover
, it will not only send log to klog or system log, but also it will send 
netlink message.
Filesystem events connector is very simple functionally, it just focuses 
on filesystem activities. Process Events
 Connector(cn_proc) is a very typical case.

Anti-virus software can use this feature to monitor malign software's 
activities, foe example, modify system
configuration or critical share libraries. Some system administration 
applications can use to obtain filesystem
 activities of every user in order to diagnose some system troubles.
