To be defined where?  Do we assume everyone will #include
<linux/module.h> or something?  Or #include <linux/external.h>?  It
seems a little absurd, since the whole file would be something like
  #define MAKEFILE_LINE(foo...)
  #define CONFIG_LINE(foo...)
  #define CONFIG_HELP_LINE(foo...)
(Of course you'd probably use something other than CONFIG_LINE because
that would needlessly confuse mkdep.c and checkconfig.pl.)
