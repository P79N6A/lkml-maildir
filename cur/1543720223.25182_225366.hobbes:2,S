Nothing. Just the interleaving will not be very good.
Just the vma interleaving relies on order 0 right now.
But I would really try to use vmalloc() for this. In fact you don't
even need vmalloc_interleaved(), because the normal vmalloc allocation
together with the interleave policy should do the right thing.

Better don't do that. It may break some subtle assumptions.
I guess the in_interrupt() allocations will have to live with that.
They should be relatively rare.
In theory you could add a system_state == SYSTEM_BOOTING check again,
but polluting the fast path for this would be imho overkill.
