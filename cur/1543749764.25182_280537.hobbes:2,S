ACK. For a given piece of code this means all copyright holders (not
just one).

No, this has nothing to do with it.

Yes, and this is actually makes the GPL incompatible with Author's
rights. However, you are allowed to transfer all rights of use of your
works (which all the artist and programmers are doing) which is usually
enough to satisfy the GPL. IANAL though (and this has not been tested in
court AFAIK).
And for the Linux kernel, Linus actually likes it that way AFAICT.

That depends on the definition of "free" (and the goals of the defining
parties) and there are more than one - e.g. behind the GPL and BSD
license are different interpretationms of "free".
