IIRC this product is german, actually. From Henkel, I believe, but I might 
be wrong. It was named after this product. But that was not the question, 
actually.
'mrproper' will remove most of your objects, configuration, flags, etc.  
However, 'distclean' will firstly make 'mrproper', then remove your backup 
files such as "*~", "*.orig", "*.rej", etc. It's all in the Makefile, 
actually.
