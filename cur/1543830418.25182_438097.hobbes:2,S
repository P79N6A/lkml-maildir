I have also experience this problem with the ati_remote driver, but 
didn't know the fix.  If I am correct, the HZ always used to default to 
1000HZ, but not it is configurable in the kernel as 1000HZ, 250HZ, or 
100HZ.  By my calculations, the FILTER_TIME will be at most 20% longer 
than before, but as little as 2% bigger.
        HZ       Old        New        % Difference
       100       5          6          20%
       250       12.5       13.5       8%
      1000       50         51         2%
Those are my calculations based on your previously stated definitions.  
The FILTER_TIME const is only used 1 time in ati_remote.c, so I doubt 
there would be a problem redefining it.  Would a redefinition to 50 be 
more appropriate (so keep the repeat delay the same across all platforms)?
Tonight I will recompile and test the driver with the 2 new definitions 
and report on my findings.
