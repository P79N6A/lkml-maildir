yep that Java Applet was the problem. it worked when I was physically
connected by keyboard. I got the following by pressing Alt+SysRq+p but
I'm not sure it helps as being in cpu_idle looks normal to me:
Pid: 0, comm: swapper
EIP: 0060 [<c0101a57>] CPU: 0
EIP: isat mwait_idle+0x2a/0x34
EAX: 00000000 EBX: c0414008 ECX: 00000000 EDX: 00000000
ESI: c0414000 EDI: c33984e4 EPP: 00004864 DS: 007b ES: 007b
CR0: 8005003b CR2: b7f818cc CR3: 375e73c0 CR4: 000006f0
[<c0101a175>] cpu_idle+0x63/0x79
[<c041a6cf>] start_kernel+0x262/0x393
[<c041a1c3>] unknown_bootoption+0x0/0x25a
Alt+SysRq+s seems to sync and write the logs to kern.log/messages but
the logs vanish after reboot. Therefore for the time being I had to
write it down by hand but I'm sure there's an elegant way like saving
the logfiles before booting up again via a second system or livecd.
Maybe there's a better way than that?
