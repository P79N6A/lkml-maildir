Well, Linus, you're not the most conservative when it comes to freezes. 
   (Hey! Watch it with those thunderbolts!)  Alan, on the other hand, I 
would trust to be pretty conservative.
I'm afraid I haven't followed Dave & Andrew well enough in that light.
But my question is... if 2 are required, and say, Dave is as slushy on 
freezes as you are, then have we gained much?
Perhaps 2 of 4 approve with no dissenting votes?
If Dave and Andrew are relatively conservative on freezes, then this 
concern is sufficiently addressed already.
Food for thought from a relative nobody. ;)
