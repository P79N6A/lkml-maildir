PF_SYNCWRITE? What's that???
(find | xargs grep ...)
Oh.  The block device schedulers like to know if a request is sync or
async (and all reads are assumed to be sync) - which is reasonable -
and so have a per-task flag to tell them - which isn't (IMO).
md/raid (particularly raid5) often does the write from a different
process than generated the original request, so that will break
completely. 
What is wrong with a bio flag I wonder....
Hopefully this will get wrapped up in a do_X helper so nfsd won't need
to know about it.
Thanks for the heads-up.
