I don't support twisted patches, but before they will be resent, because
word wrapping may lead to 80-colums rule, please find useful this:
sed -r '
# assume only line started from [+-] got wrapped
# start what ever first line
/^[-+]/{
:more;
# append next line, to check wrapped addition
N;
# if it is one, i.e starts not with [ \t+-], '@@' or 'diff'
# do "\n" -> " "
s_\n([^d@ \t+-])_ \1_g;
# loop until find one(addition), because line(s) already here
T more;
# special case of empty line
s_\n$_&_
t more;
b;
};'
