Slightly ambiguous.  Instead just say:
If you have initialized your kobject via kobject_init() or
kobject_register(), you must not deallocate the kobject anywhere other
than its release() method (which is invoked during the final
kobject_put() call).  Otherwise the kernel will leak memory.

In theory modules shouldn't present a problem -- especially if Greg 
merges the "Kobjects: drop child->parent ref at unregistration" patch.
When a module is unloaded, it has to unregister all its kobjects, which 
should force all their children to be unregistered too.  At that time 
the children's drivers should drop all their references to the parent 
kobject, leaving only references held by the module being unloaded.  
Presumably it can arrange to drop its own references before its exit() 
routine returns.
The only problem arises when a child's driver retains a reference to 
the parent kobject.  If things are done properly, this reference should 
involve incrementing the module count -- which would prevent the module 
from being unloaded in the first place.
