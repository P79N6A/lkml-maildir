I'd like to get this in, but I'm not going to apply it in any case without 
way more testing.
It missed the merge window, but I'm potentially willing to let it slip in 
- but only if there are a fair number of people willing to do numbers and 
some harsh testing. Preferably people who did see problems earlier, ie at 
a minimum Chris and Ingo under the loads they used before and saw issues 
with.
So do a v10, and ask people to test.
