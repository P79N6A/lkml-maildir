Ah, thanks for that information.

Yeah, that's what I would like, and I think it would come naturally
if we move away from these "pass down a single, locked page APIs"
in the VM, and let the filesystem do the locking and potentially
batching of larger ranges.
write_begin/write_end is a step in that direction (and it helps
OCFS and GFS quite a bit). I think there is also not much reason
for writepage sites to require the page to lock the page and clear
the dirty bit themselves (which has seems ugly to me).
So yes, I definitely want to move the aops API along with fsblock.
That I have tried to keep it within the existing API for the moment
is just because that makes things a bit easier...
