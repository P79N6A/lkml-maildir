The code in uaccess.S:__arch_copy_{from,to}_user doesn't disable
pre-emption, and neither does its caller.
Pages can be unmapped just due to background paging.  I.e. it's a
normal occurrence, it doesn't require anything contrived.
So I think you're right: that looks like a bug.
The ARM uaccess code was written before CONFIG_PREEMPT was added, and
this couldn't happen then.  It could panic a kernel now.  I wonder why
it hasn't been noticed.  Maybe nobody turns on CONFIG_PREEMPT on ARM?
