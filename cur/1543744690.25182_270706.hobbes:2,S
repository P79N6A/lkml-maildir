[PATCH] PCI: remove unconditional PCI ACPI IRQ routing
From: Bjorn Helgaas <bjorn.helgaas@hp.com>
Now that PCI interrupts are routed in pci_enable_device(), remove the
unconditional routing previously done in pci_acpi_init().
This has the potential to break drivers that don't use pci_enable_device()
correctly, so I also added a "pci=routeirq" kernel option that restores the
previous behavior.  I intend to remove that option, along with all the code
below, in a month or so.
