...and Hirofumi Ogawa continues to check in beautiful, accurate kernel
patches at a furious rate, with 15,214 lines changed in 176 changesets
over the six weeks since he joined the project.

This is a little skewed by a few patches I applied before I knew about
hg commit --user, and a big move of all files from one directory to
another a while back, which Mercurial counts as changes.  Somehow,
Conrad Meyer's significant contributions did not make it in the list.
This is where I want to be able to edit Mercurial's history, is there
a way to do that?
Over the last month we have:

So now I am playing catch up with Hirofumi, and I love that.
