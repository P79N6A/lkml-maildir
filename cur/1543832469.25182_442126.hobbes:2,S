I'm just guessing now, but it's possible that the default thresholds have 
changed from 2.4.19 to 2.6.13 (indeed, the amount of progress between those 
two versions is more than some OS kernels have seen in their lifetime).
You might look at Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt and check those settings on 
2.4.19 versus 2.6.13.
What application are you having trouble with?
