Look at the subdirectory partx of a recent util-linux release
such as 2.10m. There are ioctls to tell the kernel where on some
block device the partitions live, so the kernel partition parsing
code is superfluous in principle and can be moved to user space.
(So far this has only a small handful of users that I know of,
and the support is just enough for what is actually used.
If you need more, complain, and things will improve a bit again.)
