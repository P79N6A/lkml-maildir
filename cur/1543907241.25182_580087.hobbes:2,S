AFAICT: This patchset is not throttling processes but failing allocations. 
The patchset does not reconfigure the memory reserves as expected. Instead 
new reserve logic is added. And I suspect that we have the same issues as 
in earlier releases with various corner cases not being covered. Code is 
added that is supposedly not used. If it ever is on a large config then we 
are in very deep trouble by the new code paths themselves that serialize 
things in order to give some allocations precendence over the other 
allocations that are made to fail ....
