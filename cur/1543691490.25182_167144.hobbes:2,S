If the code which uses these hooks is included in the kernel.org tree, yes.
If the code which needs the hooks is not in the kernel.org tree then people
can patch the core kernel at the same time as adding the performance
analysis patch.
If the code which needs these hooks is not appropriately licensed then
these hooks basically constitute a GPL bypass and that is not a direction
we wish to be heading in.
