I updated this patch so that it works with sparse (snapshot of
2006-may-01).  The patch is here:
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/sparse/sparse-keywords-sizes.patch
sparse additions to:
- check for C/C++ keywords: usage: -keywords
- print all global data symbols and their sizes: usage: -list-symbols
  Example of -list-symbols:
  make C=2 CF="-list-symbols" arch/x86_64/kernel/smpboot.o
  arch/x86_64/kernel/smpboot.c:90:20: struct cpuinfo_x86 [addressable] [toplevel
] [assigned] cpu_data[8]: compound size 1344, alignment 64
