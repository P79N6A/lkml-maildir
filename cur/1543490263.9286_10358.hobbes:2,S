I don't think (although I don't know) this is a kernel issue, but I've
seen a similar problem on a 2.2.3 machine. It turned out, though, that
it was a YP/NIS problem-- the linux machine is configured as a
secondary YP server, and for some reason (probably a weird timing
issue when machines came back from a power failure) it "forgot" that
it was serving the /etc/protocols file. This made all the machines
using it as a server, as well as itself, think that it had an empty
protocols file, and ping, traceroute, and the like got a "icmp:
unknown protocol" error. Strangely, the more commonly used protocols
didn't seem to have problems; IP and UDP stuff acted fine.
Anyway, just something to look at-- try "ypcat protocols" to see if
this is the problem (assuming you're using yp at all).
The gross level info is: linux 2.2.3, debian 2.0, dual PPro200 SMP,
ypwhich (yp-tools) 2.1, yp master is HPUX 10.20.
