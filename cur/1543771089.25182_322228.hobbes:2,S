Greetings Everyone.
Let me share with you my idea to make writing to this list kind of
easier. Several times I have happened to send replies to e-mails on this
list directly to their authors instead of the list. I suggest
(re)placing any Reply-To headers in incoming letters with Reply-To:
linux-kernel@... before delivering them to subscribers.
I know this may be done with procmail but not all of us may use it.
Best regards.
