Yes. And I've been told that:

Well, if that is the case, then I vote that we drop the whole patch-series 
entirely. It clearly has no reason for existing at all.
There is *no* valid reason for 16kB blocksizes unless you have legacy 
issues. The performance issues have nothing to do with the block-size, and 
should be solvable by just making sure that your stupid "state of the art" 
crap SCSI controller gets contiguous physical memory, which is best done 
in the read-ahead code.
So get your stories straight, people.
