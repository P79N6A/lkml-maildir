Badari,
I poked around looking for data on the size issue.
Here are the byte sizes for the per device and per host
structures in scsi_debug and the scsi mid level for
i386, non-smp in lk 2.5.65:
   sizeof(sdebug_dev_info)=60, sizeof(scsi_device)=376
     sizeof(sdebug_host_info)=24, sizeof(Scsi_Host)=224
So for 4000 disks they should be responsible for about
2 MB.
The scsi_cmd_cache slab info went from this before those
84 pseudo disks were added:
# cat slabinfo_pre.txt
scsi_cmd_cache         3     11    356    1    1    1 :   32   16 : 
22     301     6    5    0    0   43 :   3235     31   3264      0
to this afterwards:
# cat slabinfo_post.txt
scsi_cmd_cache        44     55    356    5    5    1 :   32   16 : 
66     398    12    7    0    0   43 :   5837     40   5833      0
I did notice a rather large growth of nodes
in sysfs. For 84 added scsi_debug pseudo disks the number
of sysfs nodes went from 686 to 3347.
Does anybody know what is the per node memory cost of sysfs?
