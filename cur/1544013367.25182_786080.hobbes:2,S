I got those, I just replied a little bit late. Thanks. I am not talking
about moving the enum to a .c file here, I am simply asking why we don't
use the already existing tracepoint naming rather than adding another
level of event description in an event field.

Because whatever slab_buffer_size() does will be done on the fastpath of
the instrumented code *even when instrumentation is disabled*, and this
is something we need to avoid above all.

I am just saying this should be moved _into_ the kmemtrace probe. This
code will have to be kept in sync with the kernel anyway.

Why ?

Please keep the logic _outside_ of the memory subsystem fastpath. This
can be done by putting it in the kmemtrace probe callbacks as I propose.

With all due respect, your argument is bogus because it does not take
into account something far more important than "long function names",
which is what the resulting assembly looks like, and how much overhead
you add. Here, you are adding the overhead of 1 more parameter *per
call* just to keep tracepoint names smaller. The same thing applies to
your added enumeration. Is it me or it does not sound like a good
tradeoff ? Remember that tracepoints in the memory allocator code are
meant to be called *very* often.
