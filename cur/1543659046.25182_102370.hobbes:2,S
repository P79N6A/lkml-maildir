Since the lack of resource reservation currently is keeping CompactPCI
hot insertion from working properly, I have a strong interest in getting
something in place before 2.6.  I've got a completely manual (kernel
command-line parameter controlled) reservation patch[1] against 2.4 that
I could start updating, but I've always thought there must be a more 
elegant way to do things than the somewhat crude fixup approach I used
in it.  I'm willing to try coding up something if you or anyone else
have some ideas as to what would be an acceptable solution.
Thanks,
Scott
