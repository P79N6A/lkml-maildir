    Unfortunately, I did not keep the .config.
    From what I remember, I had CONFIG_PREEMPT set and CONFIG_SMP not set.
    I'm not under 2.5 now, but I can recompile and test again if you want
    to be able to reproduce it and have more details..
I really can't see how it could get into a non-preemptable state along
that path. Did anything else bad happen in that session?  Any oopses or
other funnies?  Can you give more detail about what you were doing at
the time?  Was it the first use of autofs, or had you been using it
heavily?  How many autofs filesystems mounted?
Thanks,
