The ICH9 apparently provides a pair of memory mapped on-die thermal sensors.
The sensors basically shut off your hardware if it gets too hot.
ICH9 exports the base address for the sensors via a PCI device -- D31:F6, aka Linux 00:1f.6
I'm not aware of a native Linux device driver that talks to this device
(nor can I think of a useful purpose for such a driver)
So it seems what is in play here is any BIOS code that talks to this device,
and Linux's standard PCI config space restore.
My guess is that the BIOS is enabling the device on cold boot,
but not enabling it after resume from S3.
Is there a BIOS SETUP option that controls if the ICH9 thermal device is enabled or not?
