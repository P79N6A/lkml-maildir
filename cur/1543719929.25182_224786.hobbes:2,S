Subject: [PATCH][PPC32] Don't synchronize in disable_irq() if no handler
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch is the ppc32 counterpart to a fix that went into
arch/i386/kernel/irq.c last October.  The bug was noted by Al Viro: if
no handler exists, and we have IRQ_INPROGRESS set because of an
earlier irq that got through, synchronize_irq() will end up waiting
forever.
