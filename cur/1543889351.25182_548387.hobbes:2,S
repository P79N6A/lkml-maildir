per cpu is pretty important since you can potentially hit that logic more
often with your wait-time code. You don't want to effect the actual
measurement with the measurement code. It's that uncertainty principal thing.
It is looking pretty good. :) You might like to pretty the output even more,
but it's pretty usable as is.
