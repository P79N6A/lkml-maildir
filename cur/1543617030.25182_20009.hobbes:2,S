Which, BTW, is the margin that the German c't computer magazine also

Let's take Andre's patch for 2.4.18-pre4 already, it's been solid here.
No reason do delay it.
Also, it's high time Linux gets tagged queueing for ATA, FreeBSD has
been there for ages, just installed 4.4-RELEASE on a current box and
whoooooo hw.ata.tags=1 in /boot/loader.conf.local rocks with hw.ata.wc=0
(write cache off). I'll see if I find the time to do bonnie benchmarks
soon.
