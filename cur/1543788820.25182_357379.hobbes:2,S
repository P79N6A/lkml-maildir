EEP!! I forgot all about buffer alignment!! Thanks for pointing it out
:)
------------------
Two more questions.
1. Is aio_fsync of any use while 'aio_read'ing and 'aio_write'ing to
    a 'raw' device or a '/dev/sdb' with O_DIRECT?
2. I have an Ultra320 SCSI disk whose datasheet says it has a max.
    possible throughput of 78MBps
    I did a 'aio_write' onto '/dev/sdb' with O_DIRECT.
    Following are some throughput values.
    Buffer for IO   |  Avg Speed
    (in KBytes)     |
    ----------------O-----------
    Upto 512KB      |  69MBps
    1024KB          |  125MBps
    2048KB          |  250MBps
    4096KB          |  500MBps
    8192KB          |  1GBps		-- What the !! --
    Buffer cache does not come into consideration.
    Does this mean that the SCSI lower layer (aic79xx) can transfer data
    only upto 512 KB?
