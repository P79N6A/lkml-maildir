Greetings;
Has that patch someone pointed me to made it into -rc6?  I have a bit under 9 
hours uptime on a 4Gb machine, with a gimp session, email and web browsing, 
and I see I'm 27 megs into swap.  I do not have the patch now, a drive died.
However, I may still have the email that contained it, I'll check that.
That patch, IMO should be fast lane'd to make it to .28.
