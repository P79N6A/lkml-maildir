In my case, an alpha station 400 4/233 I've not been able to boot any
test kernel so far. In some instances I've had a message about not being
able to open an initial console to just sit there with the boot sequence
stoped.
I have a beta version of SuSE 6.4. The boot sequence breaks after init,
kflushd, kupdate, and one other I don't remember have started. The last
message is the kernel freeing some memory. The boot sequence stops and I
don't get a login prompt. There are no error messages.
I've tried several versions of milo. I'm running the latest now.
