I *think* I had the nut daemon working a couple of days ago, it at least 
ran without getting a tummy ache and upchucking into the logs.  But as 
for using that data usefully, nuts docs might as well be written in 
swahili.  It also doesn't seem to have a gui like the belkin programs 
give.  Or I don't know how to set it up to use a gui.  Either is a strong 
possibility...
If anyone else has it working, please speak up.  The ups is a Belkin 
F6C-1500, with some more adjectives appended that have nothing to do with 
the electronics in it.
