Easy. Place the makefile fragment with the modules that are created for
that kernel (/lib/modules/<version>/kernel.mk or some such), and ensure
that there is enough path information stored in that fragment to build a
kernel based on it (ie. such that the builder can find the original
sources that it was generated from, for the necessary header files).
