Well I see some hardirq's most from TX and timer interrups and HZ=1000 can
can change the way softirq's are run a bit.
I hacked do_softirq() sources so we can understand how things work a bit 
better.  (Use fastroute stats from /proc/net/softnet_stat). 
ksoftird == softirq's sourced from ksofttirq
irqexit  == softirq's sourced from interrupt exit
bh_enbl  == softirq's sourced local_bh_enable
Before run
total    droppped tsquz    throttl  bh_enbl  ksoftird irqexit  other   
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 000000e8 0000017e 00030411 00000000

After DoS (See description from previous mail)
total    droppped tsquz    throttl  bh_enbl  ksoftird irqexit  other    
00164c55 00000000 000021de 00000000 000000fc 0000229f 0003443c 00000000

So the major part of softirq's are run from irqexit and therefor out of 
scheduler control. This even with RX polling (eth0, eth2) We still have 
some TX interrupts plus timer interrupts now at 1000Hz. Which probably 
reduces the number of softirq's that ksoftirqd runs.
