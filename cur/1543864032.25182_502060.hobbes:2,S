pci=nommconf causes the two above-mentioned messages regarding MMCONFIG 
disapear, but otherwise everything behaves the same. Which makes me think 
whether the problem isn't somewhere else. Isn't it possible that it really 
is some other bug in the libata? Is anybody successfully using the 
sata_sil24 with SiI3132 and/or ata_piix with i945PM or simillar?
What exactly do messages like these mean?
-----------
[  231.828794] ata3.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x2

-----------
Couldn't it be a problem somewhere else? Because strange is that it also 
apears for the ata_piix disk, which isn't (I think) on that PCI-E 
controller that fails to allocate the resources (the one that the 
ExpressCard uses). Or is it?
When I try memmap=exactmap kernel panics at immediatelly booting like 
this:
-----------
Decompressing Linux...done.
Booting the kernel.
Kernel alive
PANIC: early exception rip ffffffff8027a4f0 error 0 cr2 ffffffffff5fd030
-----------
and that's it. Can anybody explain me this panic?
