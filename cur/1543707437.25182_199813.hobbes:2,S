There was something about sysenter support or something in that
general direction; I had Zwane Mwaikambo send me a patch that worked
around this for pre 4.0.5 vmware, but never got around to test it as I
upgraded the vmware software.
Grep the archives for "[PATCH][2.5] VMWare doesn't like sysenter" and
"2.6.0 under vmware ?", and look here:
