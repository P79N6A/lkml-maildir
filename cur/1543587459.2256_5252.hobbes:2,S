Hi,
Strange thing that shows up here.  Using a MB with a MVP3
chipset I have
hda - 13G udma2
hdb - nothing physical but the driver does not always agree
hdc - cdrom udma2 sometimes...
hdd - HP Colorada 20GB tape dma - sometimes...
I say sometimes for the devices ide1 since what /proc/ide/via
and hdparm (used only for info) report changes boot to boot.
Why is this happening?  I am using ac5 but have observed this
for a while.  Note that everything seem to work fine in both
cases (PIO or DMA)...
What else would help debuging this?
