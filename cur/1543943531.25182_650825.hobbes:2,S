The build of my currently running kernel for my laptop has
$ size -t amd.o cyrix.o centaur.o transmeta.o intel.o nexgen.o umc.o
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   2809	    316	      0	   3125	    c35	amd.o
   2387	    856	      0	   3243	    cab	cyrix.o
   1514	    312	      0	   1826	    722	centaur.o
   1279	    312	      0	   1591	    637	transmeta.o
   1783	    316	      0	   2099	    833	intel.o
    126	    312	      0	    438	    1b6	nexgen.o
     41	    312	      0	    353	    161	umc.o
   9939	   2736	      0	  12675	   3183	(TOTALS)
That is without optimize for size compilation, with that set I get
$ size -t amd.o cyrix.o centaur.o transmeta.o intel.o nexgen.o umc.o
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   2300	    316	      0	   2616	    a38	amd.o
   2132	    820	      0	   2952	    b88	cyrix.o
   1325	    312	      0	   1637	    665	centaur.o
   1151	    312	      0	   1463	    5b7	transmeta.o
   1575	    316	      0	   1891	    763	intel.o
    107	    312	      0	    419	    1a3	nexgen.o
     41	    312	      0	    353	    161	umc.o
   8631	   2700	      0	  11331	   2c43	(TOTALS)
I don't think the code changes in the patch do much with respect to
size.
