I would agree with you, and I was about to write something saying that trusting
that rpm is installed is bad, except that then I realized, only RedHat made this
error, and only RedHat installs need this protection.
Now, if we want to have a more general bad gcc's list, and we envision this code
evolving, then yes, Alan's code is way too specific, and we should do it
differently so as to force them to increment what gcc -v returns whenever they
want anybody to pay attention to their having fixed a bug.  I was trying to be
sociable for once though....
