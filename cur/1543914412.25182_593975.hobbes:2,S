This argument doesn't hold water. The unpleasant point
for users and distributors isn't the "binary-only"
thing, it's the "no right to distribute" problem.
And that's the same for firmware blobs or binary-only
userspace blobs.
IOW, if you can get the right to redistribute a binary-only
userspace blob which incudes the firmware inside, why
shouldn't you be able to get the right to redistribute
just the firmware?
Or the other way round: Do you think your binary-only software
will be important enough so distributors will go through
all the trouble of trying to get a license to include it in
their distribution? If so, why wouldn't they do the same
for the plain firmware blobs for in-kernel drivers?
