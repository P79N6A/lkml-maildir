The 3c905C is a well manufactured and very feature-rich NIC which at
present appears to have fewer problem reports than eepro100, 8139 or tulip.
Available in PCI, Cardbus, Mini-PCI.  A dual-interface PCI version has
just been released (3c982), although we've yet to hear of anyone trying
it with Linux.
3com provide full specs without any NDA restrictions, plus a GPL'ed
driver.
Perhaps most significantly, the 905 has full scatter/gather support.
This isn't used at present, but Alexey's zerocopy-sendfile patches
do utilise it.  He currently has scatter-gather support for acenic,
3c905 and sunhme.  I don't know what the plans are to support other
100 mbps NICs.
The in-kernel 3c59x.c isn't the world's fastest driver.  On the todo list
for 2.5 is MMIO support, scatter-gather maintenance, optional use of DPD
polling and implementation of the onboard multicast hash filter. And 
implementation of the on-board VLAN support if 2.5 becomes VLAN-capable.
