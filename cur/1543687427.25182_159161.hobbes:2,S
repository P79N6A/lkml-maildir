Yeah, broke this in 2.6 also -- apparently neglected to test that change w/o CONFIG_SMP...
Patrick suggested a cleaner way to do this code using fewer #ifdefs, so I'll try that out this evening.  Until that arrives, you can just nuke that line and the "noapic" flag will revert to being broken in ACPI mode like it was before this week.
Thanks,
