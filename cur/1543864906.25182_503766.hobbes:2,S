How much different hardware does the (old)floppy.c do? I imagine that
today, where floppies phase out, there will be, in descending order:
 * USB floppy drives (atm handled by sd.c, could be better to have sf.c)
 * FDCs on mainboards
 * 1.44M drives
 * 1.2M drives
Even a working 2.88M, as cool as it sounds, never landed in my hands ever
since I've been into computing. Perhaps the oldest, smallest disk I once
had was a 360K 5.25", but the B floppy drive to read it was already
multi-compliant that read up to 1.2M disks.
