As we have talked in #mtd, I've moved everything to JFFS3 code and
re-worked the pretty basic stuff that was already done, as a really
dirty night-hack.
I hadn't time to fix the remaining errors (no, it's not a working
patch), nor the remaining "stolen" ReiserFS code that needs to be
modified in order to make JFFS3 happy with it (priv. directory handling
in xattr initialization, etc).
I'm going to have limited time for it, I have exams these two weeks and
also finish some other work in progress.
I've uploaded a patch that applies to 2.6.11-rc4 tree, with latest mtd
tree included.

(998Kb)
I would appreciate any collaboration and help with it.
Cheers, thanks in advance and enjoy (not working) it.
:)
