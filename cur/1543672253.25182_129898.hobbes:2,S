VAXen including Ultrix start a clock at zero when booted. They
set boottime to the hwclock with the hard-to-find batteries behind
the rear door or under the board in the VAX/Station 3000. So, you
don't have a time that started in 1970 like other Unix machines
altough a conversion takes place when you actually read the time.
Raw time is in a quadword, in microfortnights (14 days / 1,000,000) =
24 * 14 = 336 hrs/* 60 = 2,160 seconds / 1,000,000 = 0.02 seconds.
