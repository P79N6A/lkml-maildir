Right. We should be picking it up eventually, since it's still in the page 
tables, but if we've lost sight of the page dirtyness we won't react 
correctly to msync() and/or fdatasync(). So we don't _lose_ the data, we 
just might not write it out in a timely manner if we ever hit the race.

I considered it, but quite frankly, if we did it that way, I'd really like 
to just fix the whole insane "set_page_dirty()" instead.
I think set_page_dirty() should be split up. One thing that confused me 
mentally was that almost all of the dirty handling was actualyl done only 
if PG_dirty wasn't already set, so the _bulk_ of set_page_dirty() really 
ends up being
	if (!TestSetPageDirty(page)) {
		.. we just marked the page dirty, it was clean before,
		   so we need to add it to the queues etc ..
	}
and that's the part that I (and probably others) always really thought 
about.
But then we have the _one_ thing that runs outside of that "do only once 
per dirty bit" logic, and it's the buffer dirtying. If we had had two 
separate operations for this all: "set_dirty_every_time()" and the regular 
"set_dirty()", I don't think this would have been nearly as confusing.
(And then the difference between "__set_page_dirty_nobuffers()" and 
"__set_page_dirty_buffers()" really boils down to one doing the 
"everytime" _and_ the "once per dirty" checks and the other one doing just 
the "once per dirty bit" act - and we could rename the damn things to 
something saner too).
If we split it up that way, then the whole clear_page_dirty_for_io() logic 
would boil down to
	if (TestClearPageDirty(page)) {
		if (page_mkclean(page))
			set_dirty_every_time();
		return 1;
	}
	return 0;
and we wouldn't even need to do any of the "clear dirty again" kind of 
idiocy, because the "set_dirty_every_time()" stuff is the one that doesn't 
even care about the state of the PG_dirty bit - it's done regardless, and 
doesn't really touch it.
That's what I wanted to do, but with the current "set_page_dirty()" setup, 
I think my patch makes reasonable sense.
