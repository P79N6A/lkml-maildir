Only write to top-most layer.
There are two reasons for this.  First it allows users to create a union
mount, test something (e.g. update the distribution) and remove every
trace from the test by umounting the top-most layer.  Such a thing can
be quite valuable.
The second reason is simplicity.  I personally couldn't even start to
describe the semantics.  If the user does a rename, which layer will the
change end up in?  What if source or target exist in multiple layers?
How to rename a directory in a lower layer containing a new file in an
upper layer?
Finding new and interesting corner cases for such a beast can be quite
entertaining.  And until someone has properly documented the semantics
for _all_ the corner cases, my enthusiasm is below freezing point.  Does
such a documentation exist?
