Well... This patch seems to do nothing... :(
none of the console= lines I pass to the kernel with lilo seem to work.
To help facilitate debugging I tried: 
	append="console=null console=lp console=tty"
And that didnt seem to do anything... I still get "cannot open initial console"
in the logs... An on the lp (I turned on lp message logging in the kernel).
What am I doing wrong?
Thanks,
Mike
