I don't know why I bother with __deprecated - I haven't seen much
evidence of the users of these functions being cleaned up, so I
think we might as well just delete the functions and _force_ people
to fix their code.  That unfortunately seems to be the only way to
get things done in this day and age, which is rather sad if that's
what it takes to kick people into action.
