Thanks.
cat /proc/slabinfo look like as follows.
Each row have three columns.
Could you tell me what do they mean in second and third column?
kmem_cache        29     42
pio_request            0      0
My second question is:
We can find memory usage of daemon(apache) by ps or top.
e.g. apache use 5400k physical memory 
Does the memory usage of /proc/slabinfo include some of 
5400k ? I guess 5400k can separate into two part
(kernel space part and user space part). 
Is any thing wrong? Thanks
Cheers,
Tom
