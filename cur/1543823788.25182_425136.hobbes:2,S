Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Zone boundary alignment fixes, cleanups v2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[Lets try that again, here is the correct patch this time.]
[Sorry for the delay, we've been busy looking to see what is
responsible for the ia64 issues with architecture independant
zone sizing.]
Following this email are two cleanup patches for the
UNALIGNED_ZONE_BOUNDARIES support in -mm.
zone-init-check-and-report-unaligned-zone-boundaries-fix --
  we currently will pointlessly report zones as missaligned even
  though they are empty and will report the first zone which can
  never be missaligned assuming node_mem_map is aligned correctly.
zone-allow-unaligned-zone-boundaries-spelling-fix -- when the
  spelling errors in zone-allow-unaligned-zone-boundaries-spelling
  were fixed the configuration options were not updated.
Both of the above patches slot into the linux-2.6.17-rc4-mm1 patch
set next to their main patches.  Amazingly, they will also apply
on top of linux-2.6.17-rc4-mm1, I don't know what patch has been
taking but it rocks.
