 Note that Gujin has a simple problem by using that 32 bits entry point:
there is no way to detect if the bzImage is compiled for 32 bits or 64 bits,
and Linux-real-mode calls a BIOS service for 64 bits only (to tell the BIOS you
are going to 64 bits - interrupt not really documented).
 Gujin can now be set to start at the 16 bits entry point, and load ELF32/ELF64
where you now the target word size, but the 32 bits entry point will "forget"
to call that service if the Linux kernel is 64 bits.
 The 32 bits entry point can still be used (-p parameter of tiny.exe) because
there seems to be a problem using the 16 bits entry point under DOS, at least
the old assembly version of the code - no more details known.
 Etienne.
