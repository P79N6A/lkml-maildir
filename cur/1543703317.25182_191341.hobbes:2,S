If it leads to a more stable kernel, I don't see why iorl can't go in 
(user perspective) because RH is going to maintain it instead of trying 
to find a developer who is competent and willing to do the boring task 
of backfitting bugfixes to sub-optimal code.
The only problem I see would be getting testing before calling it 
stable. Putting out a "giant SCSI patch" for test, then into a -test 
kernel should solve that. The fact that RH is stuck supporting this for 
at least five years is certainly both motivation and field test for any 
changes ;-)
Clearly Marcello has the decision, but it looks from here as if 
stability would be improved by something like this. Assuming that no 
other vendor objects, of course.
