If you touch e.g. XFS for a non-trivial change you'll also get a mail from
SGI politely asking to assign your copyright.  Doing this implicit is IMHO
a reall bad thing.
IF you really think it's something we should do the least thing to do is
to put a BIG WAIVER into every file for which this is in effect.
