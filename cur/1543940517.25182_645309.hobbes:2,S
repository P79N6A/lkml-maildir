Any verdict on this one?
I happen to be asking now since silly me just ""upgraded"" a mere mortal's
sorta-production machine to 2.6.24 proper without remembering
that the previous -rc6 had contained a minor but effective change
to make those wires do their thing. Or, to tell it as it was,
"Mom wasn't impressed ;)".
Perhaps it's useful to file a bug/patch
on 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/e1000/
 ? Perhaps -mm testing?
Thanks,
Andreas Mohr
