Subject: 2.3.15 hang on boot [PIIX4 IDE problem?]

Hi,
When trying to boot Linux-2.3.15 it hangs right after:
Parallelizing fsck version 1.12 9-July-98
hda2: clean, [didn't write this part down]
hda5: clean, [didn't write this part down]
hda6: clean, [didn't write this part down]
Remounting root device read-write.
[hang]
It appears to be related to the IDE controller, I have a Soyo
SY-6BA+III, with a
PIIx4 IDE controller.
Let me know if you need anything else, or if there is anything I can
try..
ps. I looked at the mailinglist archives for anything obvious and
couldn't find anything relevant .. could be because the archives lag a
bit..
Thanks,
Gerard Saraber
