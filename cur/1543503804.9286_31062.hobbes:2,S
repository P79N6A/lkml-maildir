why ? my Q20 doesn't do that! neither does the lexicon unit
that my friend has. why are you requiring the computer based solutions
to have properties not shared by their inspiration ? i'm not saying
its wrong, but i just don't understand the insistence on this ...

and if i have to choose between RTL and running a Pulsar/Scope/Kyma
under MacOS with the massive increase in processing power it would
offer, i know what i'll do too ....
audio applications that require RTL don't interest me. its just not
the kind of system i want to use. that might change over time.

pthreads (perhaps not, if you use an event-driven model)
disk i/o
possibly shared memory stuff
