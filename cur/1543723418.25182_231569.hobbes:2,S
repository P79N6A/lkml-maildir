That allows untrapped dereferencing of a NULL pointer.  IMHO, that
would be a very unintelligent thing for a program to do, to deny itself
the bug-catching features provided therein, but it's interesting to see
that it is possible.
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
int main() {
	void *mem = mmap(0,4096,PROT_WRITE,MAP_FIXED|MAP_ANON|MAP_SHARED,-1,0);
	if (mem == MAP_FAILED) return 1;
	((long *)mem)[0] = 1;
	return 0;
}
Cheers,
