You understood me wrong, I told you that not all platforms, actually only 
AVR32 and ARM seem to make use of David Brownell's gpiolib, but the MIPS 
board I am working with supports the "old" generic GPIO API which required 
you to define your own wrappers for gpio_set/get_value and such. For both 
implementations the config symbol is GENERIC_GPIO, which can somehow be 
confusing.

I use only one gpio bit as well, only the keepalive function should be 
changed. And even if we need the other ones to be changed, let's assume we 
can pass the necessary callback to the platform driver, and checking wether 
they are defined and call them or not is just trivial. This will not bloat 
the driver.

Yes, I understand, but having a max823-centric driver does not make it as 
general as it could be.

It already exists and his merged as mtx1_wdt, I just want to get rid of it if 
any generic gpio wathchdog driver can fit my needs and others.
As a general comments, Wim did not answer yet, I would like to hear from him.
