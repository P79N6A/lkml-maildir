Greetings;
I am running 2.6.0-test3 ATM, and amanda was fired off at 00:30 as 
usual.
Typically the estimate phase will be completed, and a dump of 
something begun somewhere around 27-30 minutes into the run.
I don't think the scheduler is giving amanda near enough time, gkrellm 
says the cpu is 95% nice, meaning the setiathome is still getting its 
normal time slices.  Its now 1:06 into the run, and still getting 
estimates.  Way too slow.  At 1:14, I reniced the amanda processes to 
-10, and I can see a slight hit in the seti usage.  At 1:19 into the 
run, its actually starting dumps with tar.
The system is quite responsive, whereas if I was running 2.4.22-rc2, 
some of the things amanda would do would have me looking at a blank 
line not showing what I just typed until 10 to 20 seconds after I'd 
typed it.  So that parts nice but it needs to borrow time from seti, 
already running at a nice of 20, not amanda and its sub processes 
running at 0.
Is there something I can set in /proc that would effect this?
