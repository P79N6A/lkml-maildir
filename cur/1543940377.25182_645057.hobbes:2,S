I think this is equivalent to flattening the hierarchy? We discussed this a bit 
sometime back [1], but one of its weaknesses is providing strong
partitioning between groups when it comes to ensuring fairness. Ex: imagine a 
group which does a fork-bomb. With the flattened tree, it affects other groups 
more than it would with a 1-level deep hierarchy.
Having said that, I would be interested to hear other solutions that maintain 
this good partitioning b/n groups and still provide good interactivity!
