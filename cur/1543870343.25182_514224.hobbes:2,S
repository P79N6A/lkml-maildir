Subject: [PATCH 0/2] resource control file system - aka containers on top of nsproxy!

Paul,
	Based on some of the feedback to container patches, I have
respun them to avoid the "container" structure abstraction and instead use
nsproxy structure in the kernel. User interface (which I felt was neat
in your patches) has been retained to be same.
What follows is the core (big) patch and the cpu_acct subsystem to serve
as an example of how to use it. I suspect we can make cpusets also work
on top of this very easily.
Oh and since most of the code is serving the purpose of being a
filesystem, I have renamed the patch to be a resource control file
system - rcfs!
