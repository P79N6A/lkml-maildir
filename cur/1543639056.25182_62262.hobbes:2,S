But such "I'm not a sysadmin" people will be very surprised that their
promise was IDE2 in 2.2.x, it was IDE2 in 2.4.18, it is IDE2 in 2.5.30,
and now - oops - it is IDE0 in 2.4.19. Broken, I'd say.
There is an CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD option (apparently unused...),
so use this one, if some distribution must force ide0= to promise 
if their installer cannot find master disk on /dev/hde. But changing
behavior for no reason - especially in the middle of stable series -
is IMHO unacceptable. 
Fortunately I use 2.5.30's IDE for real work ;-)
