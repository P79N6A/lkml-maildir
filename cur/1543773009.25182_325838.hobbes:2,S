I don't think only needing a few of the hooks should disqualify it -
same is true of capability.  On the other hand the fact that it always
grants permission could be taken to imply LSM is overkill.  It seems
to come down to a question of aesthetics.

True.  In fact, since those hooks were originally dropped because there
wasn't a user for them, refusing a user because the hooks aren't there
would be hillarious!

Oh, cool, I actually hadn't noticed that.  (Last I checked inotify was
in... november?)

In that case it seems to further obfuscate the code, though.  We then
have a common update hook to just call integrity+LSM hooks, which
then call into their own subsystems...
Is there a distinct advantage to be gained by separating the two?

That's true, of course.  Reiner, would any of the integrity measurement
hooks be moved to a better place than the current LSM hooks?  Is there a
preferred ordering - ie measurement should always happen before the LSM
modules, or always after?  Either of these would of course be clear
reasons to separate IMA into its own subsystem.
