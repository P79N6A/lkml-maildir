Confused.  Why do we have that test in there at all?  We should just toss
the pages one at a time into the buddy list and let the normal coalescing
work it out.  That way we'd end up with a single 16MB "page" followed by N
256MB "pages".

Maybe.  That code seems fragile and I have premonitions of unhappy arch
maintainers.
