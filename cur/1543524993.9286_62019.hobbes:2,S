FWIW, based on these additions to file_operations I had made a patch
to make all file_operations initializations into named initializers
(2 patches, one gcc and one c99) so that you could add the readv/writev
wherever you wanted, not forced to append past lock (which I hate since
so many of these struct types are now well past a single cache line)
If it makes you feel any better, it's been equally ignored :)  I've
made 3 versions, against .41-pre2, .41, and .42
Perl script:

gcc syntax patch:
	
http://sublogic.com/patches/file_operations-2.3.42-gcc.patch
	 167 files changed, 980 insertions, 2416 deletions
c99 syntax patch:
	
http://sublogic.com/patches/file_operations-2.3.42-c99.patch
	 182 files changed, 1061 insertions, 2497 deletions
(more since it takes a little over a dozen instances from gcc -> c99)
