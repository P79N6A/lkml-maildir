I don't think that the .xsession can be involved, here..... The oops 
happens BEFORE user login, and firefox definately isn't loaded before 
logging in. ;-)
Anyhow, I forgot to mention that I am using the debian/testing sarge apt 
repository ... Once again, I have a purely default configuration, with 
the exception of the kernel.  When I get home, I'll grep through my 
startup scripts... I'll let you guys know what I find.
Cheers,
Mike
