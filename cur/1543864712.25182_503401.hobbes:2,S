You were complaining about drivers that work on only one platform. 
Thus, I asked for list of said drivers, drivers that break Greg's pledge.
I'm betting they are uniformly ancient ISA or m68k or whatnot drivers.

Translation:  you don't have a clue what you are talking about, because 
you haven't even bothered to do such a search yourself.
This is /your/ criteria we are discussing.  /You/ keep talking about 
"many" (your words) non-portable and broken drivers.  And now you 
actively avoid citing examples.  Oh, except for one:  aha154x, an 
ancient ISA driver.  So, yes, I concede that if a vendor appears and 
wants to push in a new driver for ancient ISA hardware that nobody in 
the planet uses... it might not find a volunteer.  Hooray for goofy 
examples.

And hooray for shifting arguments.  If this is your summary of the 
thread, do you now concede that Greg was not being disingenuous?  Open 
specs was not the sum toto of Greg's piece.
