What is it with vendors finding MM problems and either not fixing them or
kludging around them and not telling the upstream maintainers about *any*
of it?

In that case it was a bad fix.  The aim is to fix known problems without
introducing regressions in other areas.  A perfectly legitimate approach.
You seem to be saying that we'd be worse off if we actually had a testcase.

No we don't.

32GB isn't particularly large.
Somehow I don't believe that a person or organisation which is incapable of
preparing even a simple testcase will be capable of fixing problems such as
this without breaking things.
