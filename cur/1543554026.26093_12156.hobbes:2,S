I think a default whereby the kernel built will run on any Linux-capable
machine of that architecture would be sensible - so if I grab the 2.4.0t10
tarball and build it now, with no changes, I'll be able to boot the kernel on
any x86 machine.

I'm still not convinced the wheel IS squeaking - anyone got those benchmarks??
