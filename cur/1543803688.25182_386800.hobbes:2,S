Yep, that's the way go. Unfortunately s2ram is little complicated by
need to save video state. Usually s2ram is done by script, and
embedding means it needs to be done in C. So I'll hack C program to
s2ram the machine.

We'll eventually need to do something with device ping-pong --
devices/highmem take as long as saving to disk in my case...
