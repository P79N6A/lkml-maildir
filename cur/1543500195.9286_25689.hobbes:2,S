When source code is copied, bugs are copied also.
(1)	Ping flood bug.
(2)	Sync bug.
(3)	Fragmented packet bug.
When these recent bugs were reported, they existed in:
Linux, BSD, Windows-98, Win-NT (patchlevel 1).
They did not exists in systems derived from AT&T licenses such as
SunOS and Ultrix.
It is well known that BSD and Linux share many ideas and even
implementation details. This is open source-code so this is expected.
So, if Microsoft didn't copy anybody's source. How come they copied
the bugs?
Cheers,
