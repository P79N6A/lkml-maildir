FreeBSD (at least on Alpha) makes some attempts at page-coloring, but
it's said to be far from perfect.

Why agony?  The latter helps the TLB _and_ solves the page coloring
problem (assuming the largest page size is bigger than the largest
cache; yeah, I see that could be a problem on some Power 4
machines... ;-)

Yes, that's basically what we did (there is a patch implementing a
page coloring kernel module floating around).
