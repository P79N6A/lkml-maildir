There's a wide variety of capabilities of different hardware:
1. No checksum offload. Probably not worth using LRO.
2. Full-checksum generation. Driver passes packets to inet_lro;
get_frag_header() or get_skb_header() parses packets to check that they
are TCP/IPv4 and to validate the checksum. inet_lro does further checks.
3. L4 packet parsing and checksum validation. Driver passes TCP/IPv4
packets to inet_lro. inet_lro does further checks.
4. Hardware/firmware LRO. inet_lro not needed.
You seem to be proposing that a check that is only needed in case (2)
should also be applied in case (3).  Maybe it would make more sense to
define a generic implementation of get_frag_header() for full-checksum
devices, if that's possible?
Ben.
