Structured files had been done in many ancient systems. They are dead,
Jim. Learn our history - dropping that idiocy was one of the nicest
inventions in UNIX. Linux is not the first flavour of UNIX that attracted
programmers from alien systems. This horse is flogged to death back in
early 80s. Look into unix-wizards archives. Gives serious deja vu.

	Yes? I can compile without a library. Linking is another story,
indeed, but compile is quite fine, thank you very much. Header files are
not necessary definitions for anything - they can contain any text. And
having that ability is good.

	Quite a few nice kernels were written in macroassembler. UNIX
switched to C (and it was good) in v4.
	Sigh... How it was? Those who do not understand UNIX are condemned
to reinvent it. Poorly.
