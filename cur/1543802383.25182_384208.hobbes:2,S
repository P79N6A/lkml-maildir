How is this different than all other sorts of misconfigurations? As far
as I can tell, the biggest "problem" for some is if they depend on some
binary module that will of course break with a different page offset.
For simplicity, I didn't add more than the 2/2 split, where we could add
even a 3/1 kernel/user or a 0.5/3.5 (I think sles8 had this).

That is what I have been doing, but that requires me to carry this patch
along with me all the time. So it annoys me!
I would have posted a simple patch moving it to 0xB0000000 which would
solve the problem for me as well, but I didn't because I'm sure people
would be screaming at me...

The help text could definitely be improved, it was a 30 second hackup.
Why would you want to make it depend on DEBUG?
