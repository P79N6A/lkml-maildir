So isn't it unsafe either with the NFSSVC_MAXBLKSIZE set to the original
8k? Or is it just less unsafe, then?
Anyway, I assure you the lockups occurred exactly when
server-side NFSv3/TCP got into the vanilla kernel at 2.4.19, and the only
significant difference I could see was this. I always used NFSv3/TCP
before then, and had no problems whatsoever. After that, I had to switch
to UDP.

If only the coincidence was not so clear.
