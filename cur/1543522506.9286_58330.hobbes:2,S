Hi,
I just noticed your patch but why do you use vmalloc() above just 1 page
and not the kmalloc()'s limit of 128K? Surely below 128K kmalloc() is
faster than vmalloc()? (I know ipc_alloc() does the same but why?).
And, btw, since now the number of users of vmalloc() in
performance-critical paths is growing, perhaps it is worth to come back to
the patch I submitted for review ages ago that adds vmlist_lock rw
spinlock and makes vmalloc() SMP-safe?
   
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/vmalloc-only-2.3.35-p1.patch
I.e. why should we continue adding lock/unlock_kernel around
vmalloc()/vfree() when we can get rid of the issue altogether.
Regards,
