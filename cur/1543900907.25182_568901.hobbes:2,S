Sounds great!

I don't think so.  uswsusp runs under the normal kernel which implies an 
interdependency, whereas a device driver stub'd with a small single proc 
kernel would run in its own space.
The question is, how small could this kernel stub be made and still leverage 
the device driver pool?
Thanks!
