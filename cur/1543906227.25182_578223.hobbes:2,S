Aha, I missed the rt_mutex_setprio() in insert_work().
This is not good either. Suppose we have
	void work_handler(struct work_struct *self)
	{
		if (!try_lock()) {
			// try again later...
			queue_work(wq, self);
			return;
		}
		do_the_work();
	}
What if that work was queued by the low-priority thread, and
then a high-priority thread inserts a new work when work_handler()
is running?
Oleg.
