somebody (it's beyond me) needs to port linux (SPARC or Alpha) to Pentium
is that such a crazy idea?
i remember reading a paper about a port of UNIX V7 from a PDP-11 to a PDP-11
(with the two 16bit quantities in a 32bit integer swapped)
this was so they could share a VAX disk
seems like we need a version of Linux on Pentium which has 64bit quantities
everywhere. call it a "practicing for merced" exercise :-)
