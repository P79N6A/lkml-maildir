OK.. I'm stumped..
While testing something, I tried to boot with 'rootflags=noatime', and
found the system wouldn't boot, as ext3, ext2, and reiserfs all failed to
recognize the option.  Looking at the code in fs/ext3/super.c:parse_options()
and init/do_mounts.c:root_data_setup(), it appears to be impossible
to set any of the filesystem-independent flags via rootflags, which explains
the special-case code for the 'ro' and 'rw' flags.  However, there doesn't
seem to be any way to pass nodev, noatime, nodiratime, or any of the other
flags.  (And yes, all 3 of those make sense in my environment - it's a laptop
and I don't need atime, and I use devfs so nodev on the root makes sense too).
Am I missing something?  Or in fact, is this an non-doable?
