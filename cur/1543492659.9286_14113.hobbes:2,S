actually, this was my first implementation choice.  i found that the hash
function didn't work very well with 3 8-bit tables -- it had poor
bucket size distribution characteristics.  how does one combine 3 8-bit
values appropriately to get, say, a 14-bit table index?

to generate the table, i used random(), seeded with the lower 16 bits of
tv_sec from gettimeofday().
initialize all entries in random_table[] to -1
for (i=0; i<random_table_size; i++) {
	j = random number from 0 to random_table_size - 1
	while (random_table[j] == -1)
		if j == random_table_size
			j = 0
		else
			j++
	random_table[j] = i
}
this means that the output of the table is a random number between 0 and
the table size, and is guaranteed unique for each input value.
however, i think we're making different assumptions about what goes in the
random table.  i assumed they were random numbers from 0 to table_size,
whereas some of your comments indicate you assume that the random table is
filled with random numbers from 0 to 2^16.

i'm at work now, so i have my copy handy -- yes it's the second edition.
i was mistaken: his first example *is* table-driven, but the table is used
to map keys to a random index, given that there are only a small
number of known keys, which is a different problem.
he cites a number of papers, some as late as 1997, but i don't see a
specific reference to universal hash functions.
