Subject: [PATCH] 8139too not running s3 suspend/resume pci fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Having an 8139 based device in my notebook, I often switch between it and wireless.  The problem is that the 8139too driver does not save/restore the pci configuration of the card if the device isn't running.  This simple patch moves the save/restore code so that the code runs regardless of whether or not the device is running.
I looked at other drivers and they all seem to do the same thing.  Is there a reason why this isn't done like in the patch?
