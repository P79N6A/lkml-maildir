Kidding I hope?  What would a reasonable name be?
In principle, would you accept a patch that moves the Bitkeeper docs to a web
site, with a URL and blurb in SubmittingPatches?

For what it's worth, seeing all the Linus-oriented docs together in one
Documentation directory would be helpful in general.  On the downside, it
might appear to be kind of fence around your personal involvement with the
kernel, and it's hard to see why that would be good.
I think you're kidding though, it's hard to tell.

I hope I made it clear that I believe BK is helping Linux.  Furthermore, I
don't see why Larry should not collect some advertising for his contribution.
Within limits.  IMHO, we're on the wrong side of the limit at the moment,
and moving further with no sign of moderating.

I pray for a truly free Bitkeeper.  Shows you what damn good praying does ;-)
