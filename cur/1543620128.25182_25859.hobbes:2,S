Most sane architectures reserve a thread pointer register (%g6 resp. %g7 on
sparc, tp on ia64, ppc will use %r2, alpha uses a fast pall call as thread
"register", s390 uses user access register 0 (and s390x uar 0 and 1), etc.).
On register starved ia32 there aren't too many spare registers, so %gs is
used instead.
