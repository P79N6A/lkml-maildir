Steve,
I have been itching to work on some kernel code.
If you need someone just to keep things afloat,
I'd been happy to look into it.  There would be some
start up time of course.  If you would be willing to
help me navigate the things other than code, it
shouldn't be that big of a deal.
I need a break sometimes from all the Samba server
code.
cheers, jerry
