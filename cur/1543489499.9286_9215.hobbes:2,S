Greetings!  Mounting ncpfs filesystems starts an ncpd daemon under
2.2.1, which is killed on unmount.  Similarly, smbfs mounts register
an smbmount process which persists until the filesystem is unmounted.
My problem is that when these mounts and unmounts are done by amd, as
one of its "program" mounts, the filesystems are correctly started and
stopped, but the process is not killed.  This setup has been working
fine for years under 2.0.x (and even earlier?) kernels.  Without
killing the daemon, subsequent ncpfs mount attempts fail.
Any suggestions appreciated!
