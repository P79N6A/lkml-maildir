Just a "me too". I've used htree with 2.5.44 and 2.4.20rc1. The next
fs check on the root filesystem founds corruption in /dev. After repairing
the damage and recreating the lost devices the machine ran ok for 2 days.
Then I had some ext3-fs errors and the partition got remounted read-only.
The following fsck revealed two inodes sharing the same block. I don't
have any logs of that incident anymore though :/
I'm running Slackware 9.0-beta and e2fsprogs-1.30-WIP.
