The following is a piece of code from the latter half of
schedule_timeout, in kernel/sched.c.  Is it possible that
schedule_timeout could return an incorrect value, if the jiffy value
wraps between the first and last lines shown below.
        expire = timeout + jiffies;
        init_timer(&timer);
        timer.expires = expire;
        timer.data = (unsigned long) current;
        timer.function = process_timeout;
        add_timer(&timer);
        schedule();
        del_timer_sync(&timer);
        timeout = expire - jiffies;
