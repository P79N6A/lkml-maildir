Sorry, but I have to say these are not yet ready for -mm.  While they're 
better than before (I can successfully boot), the machine locks up when 
I start X, and I wouldn't have any confidence in running with this stuff 
enabled.  I'd prefer these weren't in -mm until we somewhat confident 
one could run with CONFIG_PARAVIRT on all the time (ie, think it could 
be default on, even if it isn't).
