	I had the same problem with a 2.2.7 kernel, PPro 200, Adaptec
AHA-294X Ultra SCSI and two NICs: 3c59x and eepro100. 3c59x worked fine,
but eepro100 showed that annoying message. I solve the problem 
recompiling the kernel with another network configuration (I don't
remember what menuconfig options changed ...) and all worked again.
	Try tunning network parameters of menuconfig. It worked for me :)
