All versions of hpt366.c newer than 0.18 (namely 0.22, 0.33 and 0.34) do not 
work on my setup, but hang during "partition check" on boot. I've tried 
changing UDMA mode in HPT BIOS, but it does not seem to affect anything and 
the drives are still recognized as "UDMA(100)". The latest kernel I tried 
was 2.4.20-rc-ac4, but it behaved just the same.
My setup is (all info gathered on 2.4.17 which is the last kernel version I 
can successfully boot with and which btw has been working flawlessly for a 
long time):
 From dmesg:
