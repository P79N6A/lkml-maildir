	It may be that your BP6 is faulty, but it may also be that it's simply
overheating.  I found that in a dual system (especially) the IC that is the chipset
which ships w/ only a heatsink over it can overheat.  I had a number of problems with
the system before putting a fan on that heatsink.  Since then I have had no hardware
related problems w/ the machine (Of course, I ran it out of memory a couple of times
doing rendering, but that's hardly the hardware's fault. ;) ).
	The chip, as I recall, is below and to the right of the CPU's when looking
at it as if it was installed inside a tower case.  The heatsink on it is pretty good-
sized, but often in a large case the air around it does not circulate very well and
so sticking a fan on that heatsink cools it much better.
	Any old fan should do, I've actually got the fan attached by only 1 screw
currently since the fan was oversized for the heatsink, I did not try and remove
the heatsink to put the fan on and I would suggest you don't try.  Just very carefully
place the fan over the heatsink and drop whatever screw came w/ your fan into the hole
and carefully screw it into the heatsink on the board.
	Note: I don't work for Abit so I could be completely wrong and take no
responsibility for your actions if you mess it up and break something (Though this
seems somewhat unlikely), just letting you know what worked for me. :)  Solved ALOT
of strange problems for me.
