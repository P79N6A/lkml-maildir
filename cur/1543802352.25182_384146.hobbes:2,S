I think wording is a tad bit too aggressive here, since we (well, at least me)
haven't made many efforts to get it included, since we had to work out
some things. However at this point we should really go for inclusion,
the sooner the better (right?).

ACK.

I have to admit that a big item on our acx ToDo list was the missing ieee80211
integration, but now that there's a second stack on the horizon and things
look less decided I'm not that much troubled by our lack of ieee80211 use
any more ;)
That said, of course we should try to get rid of our own, historic (originating
from binary TI driver!) in-driver stack very soon.
I won't do any comments on which stack to use, though, I will do research first
and then work out which one to use depending on popularity and features
matching our chips' properties.
