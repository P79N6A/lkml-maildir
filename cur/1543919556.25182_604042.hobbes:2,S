Ok.  I just found out this changed to vger.  But 
netfilter-devel@vger.kernel.org is bouncing me.

Something like this (untested):

The problem is that people think they are safe with the filter table, when in 
fact they need the prerouting chain to seal things.  Right now this is only 
possible in the mangle table.
