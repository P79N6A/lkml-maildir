It depends on the hardware...  For the ioctl-only case, you are
correct.  rtnl_lock protects us there.  But when the timer and ioctl
both call mdio_xxx, you need SMP protection, otherwise you corrupt the
multi-step MDIO read/write found in many drivers.
IMNSHO the timer routines found in net drivers should all be converted
to kernel threads.  There are too many limitations placed on you by
timers.

de4x5 is becoming EISA-only in 2.5.x too, since its PCI support is
duplicated now in tulip driver.
