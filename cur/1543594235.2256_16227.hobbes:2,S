Alex,
Looking at the back of a Linksys EtherFast 10/100 manual I happen to have,
they describe two different remote wake-up events, Magic Packet and Link 
Change.  The first one is pretty obvious and is probably not related to 
your problems, but the second one may be.  The manual states ""Link Change
is a remote wake up event that is triggered by any change in the EtherFast
card's link state."  Plugging in a LAN cable is the example given that
would turn the system on.  You may have to look at the driver source to see
if this is enabled by default or you may have to modify the driver to 
disable this "feature" on the card.
Regarding the WOL cable, this was used for older motherboards before PCI
2.2,
though it is still present on newer motherboards to support older PCI cards.
A PCI 2.2 compliant motherboard and NIC use the #PME signal on the PCI bus
to signal the wake.
