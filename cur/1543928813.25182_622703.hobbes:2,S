I just say, it's exactly the same problem and it does not really make a
difference that kobject_init() does not do anything, if we require
another function to be called before we can call kobject_add(). A
kobject without a name will not be valid, and we will need a way for an
easy cleanup of allocated resources I think.

What is the whole point of kobject_init() then? You can just do the same
stuff in kobject_add() if you require not to allocate anything there. 
None of the initialized fields can be used before we have called
kobject_add(), right?

Yes, I already have a patch that does that for all stuff that was needed
on my boxes.
