Oops, sorry, I should have added the info before. My apologies. 
Here will find all the info (if you need more, tell me). Note that I tried
with and without ndiswrapper driver loaded, and I have the same hang on
resume (blank screen, HDD light fixed on, and no answer to wireless pings). 
One more note: the ndiswrapper *did* survive OK to a disk suspend cycle. 
I am running an up-to-date Mandrake 10.0 distribution, with 
a kernel 2.6.11-rc1 (Linus tree), on a Sony Vaio PGC-FX701 which is almost
working perfectly. 
* Patch applied: 
  - a little patch for ALPS pad detection.
