In a real world situation I would think that users
probing for invisible files is more secure that users
knowing the names of files that they have no access
to.

You're still thinking inside the box. Let's take the
tmp directory for example. /tmp wpuld probably g away
in favor of persomal /tmp directories. As we all know,
/tmp is the source of a lot of vulnerabilities.
One might put a name translation mask on the /tmp name
in the file name translation system. For example:
/tmp -> my /tmp
Thus files written to /tmp would become /mperkel/tmp
and users wouldn't be able to see other users /tmp
files or have any name conflicts.
Let me explain about the concept of thinking outside
the box. If you run into a problem you figure out a
new solution. It's about finding ways to make things
work rather than finding ways to make things not work.
So - we are not only talking about a name permission
system but a file name translation system. Thus a
user's view of the file system might not be the same
for all users. In fact, let's say that mperkel is a
Windows user and is just attacking to Linus as a file
system. Because mperkel is in the windows group the
file system appears as h:\home\mperkel on a native
Linux level and mounts are drive letters. It would use
a Windows name translation mask program that would be
part of the permission/naming system.
