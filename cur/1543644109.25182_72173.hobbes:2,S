Don't know the product, but I take it that this is a single IDE drive that can 
read and write CDs, and read (and perhaps write) DVDs? If you want to write, 
use ide-scsi+sg+scd, else just use ide-cdrom.
Until we have another userspace and kernel combination for writing, you are 
stuck with cdrecord and sg. It'd be an vaguelly interesting exercise to have 
a CD burning app that worked natively with ide-cdrom, but I have about a 
million more important things to do before I'd start on that :)
If anyone is interested in coding this, what I'd really like to see is a CD 
burning library that works with sg and ide-cdrom. You'd probably need to 
modify ide-cdrom - I have no real idea about ATAPI or any other block device. 
Then we could move away from GUIs that are really all just running the same 
command line application, and get some more interesting handling going.
