I fear this as well.  In fact, I'm relatively certain that they /do/
both use the same PCI ID.  Hence why lspci lists KT133/KM133.  But I
hope to big mistaken.  If not, the only way I can see of detecting that
it is a KM133 is by checking what device 01:00 is an S3 ProSavage.
Yuck.
Hopefully I'll here back from VIA with a definitive answer about when to
clear what bits, though.
