Did you see W$ sources? I didn't.

Try it.
linux/drivers/sound/mpu401.c:
        /*
         * Sometimes it takes about 30000 loops before the output becomes ready
         * (After reset). Normally it takes just about 10 loops.
         */

I need a timer around 2000Hz for some good code. I won't support polling
mode (busy loop) in any case.

No, MPU401 has Rx interrupt.

I don't know, how is this problem solved under W$.
