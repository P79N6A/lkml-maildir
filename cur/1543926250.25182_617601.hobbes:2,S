The value can be supplied on the command-line so we need to validate input.
The code is a copy of what happen when reading a all.config file and
the functionality should be equal.
Can we make that part simpler too?
By the way - I have never understood the purpose of the flags (S_DEF_USER etc.)
Can we have a few comments added to their definition?

The future plan is to set the architecture as part of the configuration step
and not by ARCH=. The ARCH= notation will continue to be supported
but will merely be a hint about the desired architecture.
The only place where it will play a real effect is when generating
allnoconfig, allyesconfig, allmodconfig, randconfig.
Some consistency check will likely be added - but a pure 'make' will
build the kernel with the configured ARCH and the configured CROSS_COMPILE
setting.
One of the blockers are that kconfig does not support more than one prompt
for a choice symbol. Is this something you can fix - or sketch how to fix it?
