CAB is an archive container format, not a compression algorithm.  Last 
time I worked on some code to handle it, they used the standard LZW 
algorithm implemented by gzip ( but had the ability to support others in 
the future ) and could only compress 32kb blocks.  The small block size 
led to poor compression.
