If you read x.bmp do you eventually start reading x.bmp:thumbnail?
% make_thumbnail.sh < x.bmp > x.bmp:thumbnail
Now you have two files
  x.bmp
  x.bmp:thumbnail
:)
To create something you can copy, rename or delete with one operation, put
it in a directory.

Re ntfs; Anton Altaparmakov is doing "Odd Fixes" (see MAINTAINERS). If
such files can be created on ntfs then it would perhaps be nice to be able
to access them. I'm sure he will appreciate all help.
Re others; it's not unixy ...
If you look at such a file exported with SMB what does the client see?
Can you do "echo hello > //server/share/x:y" ?
