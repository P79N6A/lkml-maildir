Hi,
I have suddenly no working usb anymore. It worked perfect with 2.5.68
(And all earlier 2.5.x I have tried (which are most of them)). I get
this in the log:
drivers/usb/core/usb.c: registered new driver usbfs

Please use the 'usbfs' filetype instead, the 'usbdevfs' name is
deprecated.

(Here I first load uhci-hcd, usblp (but the printer wasn't connected :P
), scanner and usb-hci. The thirs usb device connected is a pl2303
serial converter. Didn't load that driver.)
I have read somewhere that the USB device not accepting new address
means that the host-controller doesn't get an interrupt, and that this
often is because of ACPI. It's just the same with acpi disabled (and in
2.5.68 it did work with and without acpi).
Do you need any more info, or am I just doing something really, really
stupid?
Thanks.
Best regards,
Stian
