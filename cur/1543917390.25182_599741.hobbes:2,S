Well, pulling in iwlwifi would require also pulling in the mac80211
subsystem, so it's not quite that simple (although I'm not sure what's
holding back that going into the kernel.)
I had no problem building my personal production kernel by taking
2.6.23-rc8, and doing a git pull from the everything branch in John
Linville's wireless-dev git tree.  It's probably too late to pull it
for 2.6.23-rc8 (although if Linux wanted to do it it's only one git
pull command away :-), but it would be really nice if it could get
merged in for 2.6.24.
