Fair enough.  Thanks.
Another scenario may be where (say) a network driver is modprobed
from a hotpluggable disk controller.  You want to be able to load
the netdriver, pop out the disk controller and then insert the network
card.  Or vice-versa - load a parallel port driver across NFS then
pull the network card and push the parallel port card.  Could use
local disks for this, of course.
