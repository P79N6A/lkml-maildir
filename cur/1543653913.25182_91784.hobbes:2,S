What kind of strange _crap_ is this?

You're doing a compat layer, and then you're using various undefined types 
that can be random sizes, and calling them xxx_t32.
For christ sake, somebody is on drugs here.
If they are called "xxx_t32", then that means that you _know_ the size 
already statically, and you should use "u32" or "s32" which are shorter 
and clearer anyway. You should sure as hell not use some random C type 
that can be different depending on compiler options etc, and then calling 
it a "compat" library.
Quite frankly, I don't see the point of this AT ALL. You're introducing 
new types that cannot be sanely used directly anyway. What's the point?
Make your compat stuff use u32/s32/u64 directly, instead of making up ugly 
new types that make no sense.
