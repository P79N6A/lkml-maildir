SO_BROADCAST controls sending, not receiving.
This definition comes from the BSD sockets API, even
Stevens TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 2, page 437, figure
15.4 clearly states that SO_BROADCAST means "socket
can send broadcast messages".  It says nothing about
receiving and the BSD implementation matches that
description, as does Linux.
This has been brought up before, search for the
subject "UDP Broadcasts not delivered to IP address"
in the linux-net list archives for one such thread.
