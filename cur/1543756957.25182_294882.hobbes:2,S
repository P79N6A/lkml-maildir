Then how do you handle overlapping nodes.  If I am doing a 5->4, 4->3,
3->2, 2->1 shift in the memory placement and had only a from and to node,
I would end up calling multiple times.  This would end up in memory shifting
from 5->4 on the first, 4->3 on the second, ... with the end result of
all memory shifting to a single node.
With the array-of-node maps, you make a single pass across the address
space.  This results in a clean mapping without the userspace needing to
know which nodes the pages are on.
On a seperate topic, I would guess the syscall time is trivial compared
to the time to walk the page tables.
Thanks,
Robin
