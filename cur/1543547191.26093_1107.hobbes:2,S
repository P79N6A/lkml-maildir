Subject: clocks out of sync even after running xntpd on Alpha

On UP2000, time gets lagging behind, while on LX164 with AlphaBIOS,
time gets faster about a minute a day compared to two other Linux
boxes with Intel CPUs.  On both Alpha machines with SuSE-6.4, 
I started /etc/rc.d/xntpd at boot time.  Had checked the time right
after boot, both clocks were reset correctly to clock of the xntp
server as expected.  
What is responsible for this error?  The real-time clock of each machine
or the kernel?  RTC support has been enabled on the kernel config 
on every machine.
Best regards,
