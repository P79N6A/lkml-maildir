Subject: [PATCH 2.6.21] m32r: Fix switch_to macro to push/pop frame pointer if needed

Hello,
This patch fixes a rarely-happened but severe scheduling problem of
the recent m32r kernel of 2.6.17-rc3 or later.
In the following previous m32r patch, the switch_to macro was
modified not to do unnecessary push/pop operations for tuning.

In this modification, only 'lr' and 'sp' registers are push/pop'ed,
assuming that the m32r kernel is always compiled with
-fomit-frame-pointer option.
However, in 2.6 kernel, kernel/sched.c is irregularly compiled
with -fno-omit-frame-pointer if CONFIG_SCHED_NO_NO_OMIT_FRAME_POINTER
is not defined.
 -- kernel/Makefile --
   :
 ifneq ($(CONFIG_SCHED_NO_NO_OMIT_FRAME_POINTER),y)
 # According to Alan Modra <alan@linuxcare.com.au>, the -fno-omit-frame-pointer is
 # needed for x86 only.  Why this used to be enabled for all architectures is beyond
 # me.  I suspect most platforms don't need this, but until we know that for sure
 # I turn this off for IA-64 only.  Andreas Schwab says it's also needed on m68k
 # to get a correct value for the wait-channel (WCHAN in ps). --davidm
 CFLAGS_sched.o := $(PROFILING) -fno-omit-frame-pointer
 endif

Therefore, for the recent m32r kernel, we have to push/pop 'fp'
(frame pointer) if CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER is defined or
CONFIG_SCHED_NO_NO_OMIT_FRAME_POINTER is not defined.
