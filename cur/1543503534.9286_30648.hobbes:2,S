Hi,
  did not you change your screen resolution? Readline library used by
bash reads screen size only at startup and if you change screen resolution
(mainly screen width) after bash starts, it does strange things because
of real cursor position does not match with position computed by readline.
  For example, if readline thinks that line start is one line up and twenty
backspaces (because of you typed 100 chars with COLS=80) and you now have
COLS=120, it gets printed one line above at column 80...
  I do not know any other workaround than restarting bash session.
                                        Best regards,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
