Or, think out of the box...
Maybe you can introduce some interfaces that expose information both in
sysfs (in normal human-readable formats) and in a way that lets you get
the same data out in some binary format.  
Seems to me you'll have a lot easier time justifying all of these lines
of code spread all over the kernel if there are a few more users off the
bat.
