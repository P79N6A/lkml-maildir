yeah you want fd_open mostly in threaded programs i'd bet -- which your
example code wouldn't help with :)
the case where i've wanted it was a threaded program accessing deep into
user home directories (mail folders) across NFS ... on solaris where it
insists on doing LOOKUPs from the root and doesn't seem to ever cache the
intermediate steps.  sometimes it's better to write multiprocess servers
with chdir().  (i know on linux i'd either win from the dcache or just go
about using clone in a different way and could avoid the problems.)
also need fd_stat, fd_opendir, ...
