The OED (Oxford English dictionary) seems to be at odds
with most other online dictionaries with respect to the
word illegal. I find the following 'illegal' entry
(at www.askoxford.com) daft:
  "USAGE Both illegal and unlawful can mean 'contrary to
   or forbidden by law', but unlawful has a broader meaning
   'not permitted by rules': thus handball in soccer is
   unlawful, but not illegal."
So if we followed the OED's advice then SCSI's "illegal
request" would become "unlawful request". I'm yet to
see the word "unlawful" in any technical standard ...
