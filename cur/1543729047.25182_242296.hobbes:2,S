Adding this code causes the rhine-related latency reports to go away. 
Should I try removing the second pair, to verify it's the first chunk
that's responsible?
With this, and the extract_entropy hack, the biggest common latency I am
now seeing (the copy_page_one is bigger but rarer) is the XFree86
unmap_vmas issue.  This one actually occurs so often that I can't tell
what #2 is.
