I have rewritten the generic proc read routine to at least be
comprehensible.  (It's the stuff that interfaces the read calls
made at FS level to the functions registered with proc).
I was waiting for notices to come in of uses of some of its (to me obscure
and probably disused) modes before I changed the functionality to get rid
of them. I've been collecting the notices here and will cheerfully post a 
suggested patch shortly ... (snowed under here).
