Isn't the ioctl switch stack issue a separate GCC bug?
It was/is assigning assigning separate space for local variables which
are mutually exclusive. So instead of the stack footprint of the
function with the switch() being equal to the largest individual stack
size of all the subfunctions, it's equal to the _sum_ of the stack sizes
of the subfunctions. Even though it'll never use them all at the same
time.
Without that bug, it would have been harmless to inline them all.
