Hi Mauricio,
Here is a canned answer to that age-old question:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-fileutils/2001-10/msg00048.html
Now in your case, I would find some way to get configure to do what you want it to without that long argument list.
Maybe you can find some files to modify manually to "hard code" your options in the tree of aubit4gl.
Perhaps there are a few Makefile variables that can be hardcoded.
I probably would not bother recompiling the kernel in order to get a larger environment space just to pass this huge tank of a command line for a single build.
