Please use rdpmc() instead of rdmsr() when reading counter registers.
Ditto in the other places.
(I know oprofile doesn't, but that's no excuse.)

Why not "if ((int)low >= 0)"?

Depending on the value of nmi_watchdog and how oprofile was
set up, neither, just one, or both of them can cause NMIs.
Only one of them can do it via the performance counters, however.
How do you handle multiple simultaneous NMIs from different sources?
