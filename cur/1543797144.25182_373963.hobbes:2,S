well I don't see the point for the abstraction... get_kernel_pid() is no
better or worse than using current->pid directly, unless you want to do
"deep magic".

same thing, different name :)

hmm this is scary. If you don't have "unique" pids inside the kernel a
lot of stuff will subtly break. DRM for example (which has the pid
inside locking to track ownership and recursion), but I'm sure there's
many many cases like that. I guess the address of the task struct is the
ultimate unique pid in this sense.... but I suspect the way to get there
is first make a ->user_pid field, and switch all userspace visible stuff
to that, and then try to get rid of ->pid users one by one by
eliminating their uses... 
but I'm really afraid that if you make the "fake" pid visible to normal
kernel code, too much stuff will go bonkers and end up with an eternal
stream of security hazards. "Magic" hurts here, and if you don't do
magic I don't see a reason to add an abstraction which in itself doesn't
mean anything or doesn't abstract anything....
