care about is the empty set.
And we the kernel developers have made no promises to keep any
of the sysctl values constant.
From sysctl.h:

From the sysctl(2) man page.

The empirical evidence is also that no one uses sysctl, and that no one cares.
Once we can find that one user that really cares we can have serious conversations
