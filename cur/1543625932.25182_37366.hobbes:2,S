Thanks.
It seems that there is some more problems.
I have not verified the lookup (since I just booted right away with the patch), but
I have found that:
Mar 26 23:56:58 gw kernel: nfsd: LOOKUP(3)   24: 03000001 03000900 00000002 0000106d 0000106c 0000070d WMRootMenu
Mar 26 23:56:58 gw kernel: RPC request reserved 240 but used 244

Mar 27 00:30:21 gw kernel: RPC request reserved 272 but used 276
And there might be others.
I would be happy to post a patch, but I do not know the
exact reason for the calculations in struct svc_procedure.
I guess that it has to do with how the request is constructed.
