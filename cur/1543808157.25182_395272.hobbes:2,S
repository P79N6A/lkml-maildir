Ok - since you have suspicions, I will dump what I have found so far,
and pass the baton to your good hands.
The following "facts" are not to be trusted too much, just what I
think I have now.
The following 34 files seem to come up differently in the hg side than
the git side, for 2.6.16-rc2, with the hg side having patches showing
up as already in 2.6.16-rc2, that the git side things showed up later,
after Linus tagged 2.6.16-rc2.

The linus.patch of 2.6.16-rc2-mm1 won't apply to the git variant
of 2.6.16-rc2, because that *-mm1 tries to apply the changes on the
above files that are already present.
Good luck with it.
Thanks, Matt.
