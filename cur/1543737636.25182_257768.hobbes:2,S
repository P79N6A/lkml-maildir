They only ever published the initial code drop.  No code maintenance since
or any kind of documentation ...  However one of the group of code submitters
back then was claiming to run Gnome with remote X display - probably because
at least back then there was no support for the printing hw and anyway,
the refresh rate of a printer is somewhat limited ;-)
As I recall the code was originally submitted by roger_twede@hp.com.
