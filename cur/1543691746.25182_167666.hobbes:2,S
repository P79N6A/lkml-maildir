I was sort of joking, but the point is that a function call might be
too slow on a 386.
On a 386, a function call for every byte transferred to/from the
floppy disk might show up as a real overhead - this occurred to me
because someone once thought it was worth rewriting the floppy data
transfer code in assembly language, and presumably it did improve
performance at the time.
Of course the answer is to not use udelay() on 386-optimised
configurations.
