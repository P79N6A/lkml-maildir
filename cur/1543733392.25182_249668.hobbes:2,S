Hi kernel fellows,
I volunteer. I'll try something tomorrow to compare swappiness of older kernels like  
2.6.5 and 2.6.6, which were fine on SGI's Altix tests, up to current newer kernels 
(on small memory boxes of course).
Someone needs to write a vmstat-like tool to parse /proc/vmstat. 
The statistics in there allows us to watch the behaviour of VM
page reclaim code.
Con, if you could compile a list of reports we would be very grateful.
