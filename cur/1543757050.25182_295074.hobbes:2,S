Yes, that was the goal. I looked over the drivers and it was either
writing the exactly same code 10 times or moving it down.

Hmm, you got me a bit confused here - open and close in gameport are
already (indirectly) serialized with gameport_sem. It is input device
open and close in joystick drivers that needs treatment - these are
initiated from userspace and weren't hitting gameport code at all. And
they need to be protected otherwise the counter and timer will get out
of whack.
