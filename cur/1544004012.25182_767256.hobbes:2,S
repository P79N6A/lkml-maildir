I think the idea is for a dynamic dirty_ratio based on a static value 
dirty_amount_in_bytes:
	dirtyable_memory = determine_dirtyable_memory() * PAGE_SIZE;
	dirty_ratio = dirty_amount_in_bytes / dirtyable_memory;

Only dirty_ratio is actually updated if dirty_amount_in_bytes is static.
This allows you to control how many pages are NR_FILE_DIRTY or 
NR_UNSTABLE_NFS and gives you the granularity that you want with 
dirty_ratio_pcm, but on a byte scale instead of percent.
It's also a clean interface:
