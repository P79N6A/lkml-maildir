<SERIOUS MODE>
   id software has just released the source for Quake 1 under GPL
   licence according to /. a few minutes ago...
</SERIOUS MODE>
<HUMOR MODE>
   Since it is GPL, is anyone working on porting Quake to kernel
   mode?  It would make a nice addon to SYSRQ for example:
   ALT-SYSRQ-Q would fire up Quake, which has been patched to be
   in kernel, and also patched with similar patches to the DOOM
   System Administration patches that let you kill processes,
   etc...
</HUMOR MODE>
I just thought it would be funny...  Any whackos out there that
take this seriously, and try to actually do it, need serious
therapy.  ;o)
Take care,
TTYL
