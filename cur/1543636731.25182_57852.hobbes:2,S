*thwaps forehead*   Ohhh, quite right.  Darn.  :) 
Hmmm.  Does it sound acceptable to still increment pgdeactivate in
mm_inline.h, and explicitly put hooks for pgactivate in the select places
where pages really _are_ being 'reactivated'?  That sounds fairly sensible
to me -- unless you want to differentiate between pages that leave the
active list via drop_behind() versus deactivate_page_nolock().
Many thanks,
