Frank's patch looks fine to me except one place:
diff -ru a/mm/mmap.c b/mm/mmap.c
--- a/mm/mmap.c	2005-09-21 11:07:40.000000000 +0200

  	if (flags & (VM_RESERVED|VM_IO))
  		mm->reserved_vm += pages;

  }
  #endif /* CONFIG_PROC_FS */
I have a question of adding this call here. 'update_mem_hiwater'
does nothing unless mm->total_vm or rss gets updated.
I do not see total_vm get updates in __vm_stat_account()?
