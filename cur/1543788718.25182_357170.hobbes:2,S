+	  What this will do on workstations is slowly bring back applications
+	  that have swapped out after memory intensive workloads back into
+	  physical ram if you have free ram at a later stage and the machine
+	  is relatively idle. This means that when you come back to your
+	  computer after leaving it idle for a while, applications will come
+	  to life faster. Note that your swap usage will appear to increase
+	  but these are cached pages, can be dropped freely by the vm, and it
+	  should stabilise around 50% swap usage.

How about a little note about the impact for server users as well?
You recommend that desktop users enable this, but you don't give any
recommendation for servers.
