Hello
If iam using tasklets for deferred processing, and after some threashold
processing in the tasklet 
would like to reschedule tasklet again. will the following work
tasklet_function()
{
	more_processing = DeferredProcessing()
            if (more_processing)
	       tasklet_schedule() // this will schedule the same tasklet.
}
is the above legal.
