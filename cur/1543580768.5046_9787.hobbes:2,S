Oh you English people,
why do you do it so complicated?
We even don't need a kernel locale.
Take the nominations as they are, color/colour,
disk/disc/diskette/floppy, etc.
And if you write by yourself, do it as you spell it.
I'd even write it German if I wasn't used to speak
fully English whilst coding.
And dont bother about names:
 - Namen sind Schall und Rauch. Was zaehlt, ist das, was drin ist.
(for tho who can understand it. the others: sorry, it's a cite.)
Does it _actually_ make a prob to use disc in devfs instead
of the (correct) disk when changing it broke configuration?
We are _not_ M$, we (usually) _dont_ break old systems.
And __colour does only matter when you directly access it.
Really, it's inconsistent, but it happened - so...
You could consider changing it on a two-year solution:
create a hardlink /dev/disks <-> /dev/discs in the KERNEL(!!)
and remove /dev/discs in two years.
Meanwhile everyone reading docu will have upgraded ;-)
