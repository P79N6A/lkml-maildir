Bugs where? Does this count as a hardware issue or a software issue? I'm
seeing similar problems with DLink 580TX boards (sundance driver) and
both SiS 730 and Intel Camino chipsets, under 2.4.21 (and .22). I've
seen a suggestion that ACPI might help, but no definite answers. Equally
no mention of what hardware is a good choice if that's the root cause.
