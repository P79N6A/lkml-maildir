OK,
Upon closer analysis of the code, I see that log_rtas_error() 
was incorrectly named, and was being used incorrectly.  The 
solution is to get rid of it entirely; see patch below. So:
-- In one case kmalloc must be GFP_ATOMIC because rtas_call()
   can happen in any context, incl. irqs.
-- In the other case, I turned it into GFP_KENREL, at the cost
   of doing a needless malloc/free in the vast majority of 
   cases where there is no error.  Small price, as I beleive
   that this routine is very rarely called.
Patch below,
