I have 1800+MP processors and my PSU is 400W.  Of course I also have the 
little four prong connector plugged in as well.
My bios is 1006, but I've also tried 1005a and get the same problems.
I've swapped every component in the machine with the Tiger MP board and 
get the same problem, ie.  760MP works fine 760MPX dies.
What bios version are you running?

I just installed the customized redhat 7.3 kernel and it fixed all the IDE 
problems but not the kernel panics.
