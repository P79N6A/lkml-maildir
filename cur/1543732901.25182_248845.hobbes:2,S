A series of 5 patches coming up that make acpiphp work on an rx8620.
Unfortunately, they'll cause i386 to not work, so don't apply these
for now.
01-pci-bus-address.diff
Adds a way to convert from a global system address to a local pci bus address.
02-ia64-fixups.diff
Fix some bugs.  Nothing earth-shattering.
03-acpiphp-domains.diff
Make acpiphp handle domains properly
04-acpiphp-pcidev.diff
Prevent acpiphp from crashing the system in nasty untracable ways
05-acpiphp-misc.diff
Some minor cleanups

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
