There are two issues here: freeing the IRQ handler and preventing the 
device from generating interrupt requests in the first place.  Dave and I 
discussed this some time ago and agreed it was vital to stop interrupt 
generation at the source, before releasing the handler, whenever the 
device is suspended.
So the real question becomes, is your OHCI controller somehow generating 
interrupt requests at a time when it shouldn't be?  Adding debugging 
printk's to the driver's interrupt handler could answer this.
If it isn't, then the problem you see has some other cause.  ACPI often 
turns out to be the culprit.
