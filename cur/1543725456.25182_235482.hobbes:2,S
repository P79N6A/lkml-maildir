Hi,
With 2.4.27rc2 (and I assume anything later than pre5 - that's when 
DVD-RW got added) DVD-RAMs have become read-only. Opening a DVD-RAM for 
writing results in "EROFS (Read-only file system)" (reported by 
'strace'. Let me know if I can provide any further info.
I'd be happy to test any fixes.
Also, any chance we get proper 'DVD-RAM is write-protected' support in 
2.4.x ? It'd be really nice if write()/open(O_WRONLY) would fail in 
those cases.
Tx,
Mathias
