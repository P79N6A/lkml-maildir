By the way, the reason is that this stupid utility opens the device
read-only (hence it can't fix nothing).
from hfsplusutils/libhfsp/src/fscheck.c:
    result = fscheck_volume_open(&vol, device, HFSP_MODE_RDONLY);
Seeing that it has been untouched since 2002, I guess it'll be hard to
get it fixed. Or maybe it's just me being idiot and I should use
another fsck ?
