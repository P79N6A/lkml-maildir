The best way to do this stuff has already been outlined by Ingo himself, 
and as far as I know he's still the man leading the show.  And no one 
objected to his strategy so far.
There is just no rush.  It doesn't have to be integrated ASAP, and 
actually not before a while, and then certainly not in a disturbing way.  
Lots of things have to be cleaned up in the patch, and even in the 
current stock kernel for that matter, and Ingo even agreed to that.
So any discussion about merging of PREEMPT_RT into mainline is simply 
hand waving at this point.  Let it evolve and resume this discussion 
when there is actually something being proposed for merging into 
mainline.
