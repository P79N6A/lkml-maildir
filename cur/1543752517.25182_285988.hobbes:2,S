Yes, all the structure members have explicit size (u32 or u64).
> Standard question: was netlink considered?
Yes, but it does not give me enough control over the communication.
For example the READ operation currently passes the page(s) to be
filled to the FUSE device handler, and when the READ reply is sent by
userspace, data is copied directly to those pages.  With a socket
based solution immediate buffers would be needed.
Thanks,
