Not sure if this is what's causing your problem, but the version of mt
that ships with RH 5.2 is broken.  Try downloading and building
mt-st-0.5b.  From the README:
Changes in version 0.5b:
- corrected the bug that caused the command argument to be ignored if
  option -f was used
- added #include <errno.h> to stinit.c (for glibc)
- density 0x45 (TR-4) added to known density list
