It sounds like the vdso just needs to be treated as a prelinked
vdso.  You can find everything you need with AT_SYSINFO_EHDR.
In the case of function descriptors they should be in a data segment
that can get copied to another page, and corrected.  Leaving the code
segment at it's randomized location.
