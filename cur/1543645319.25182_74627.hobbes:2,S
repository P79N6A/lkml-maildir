In my case I gave 2.5.x an attempt at building on my x86 box a few weeks
ago but had to give up because of the lack of LVM which I rely on.
I fancy having a go on some of my non-x86 boxen; does anyone know the
state of 2.5.x for non-x86?
(Does anyone other than some marketing bods really care if it is 2.6 or
3.0 - I definitly don't).
