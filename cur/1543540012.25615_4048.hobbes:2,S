I've written quite a few programs that use new kernel features that
aren't in Glibc.  A recent one includes <linux/ppdev.h>.  That's easy,
an iocl.  Another use O_NOFOLLOW, which wasn't defined in Glibc for a
while.
I know you want every application to copy the ioctl & structure
definitions it uses -- and this does work.  But it's just _so_ ugly when
you want to pass a small program to someone else and must include the
set of header files it uses too.
O_NOFOLLOW's definition varies with each architecture.  So following
your suggestion, I'd have to distribute that program with the
appropriate <asm-$arch/fcntl.h> for every value of $arch.  And even that
doesn't let the program compile on new architectures later down the
line.
I decided to tackle this by having autoconf read the value from
<asm/fcntl.h> and define a macro with that value. (Because you can't
include include <asm/fcntl.h> and <fcntl.h> at the same time).  That
turns out to more complicated than you'd think: <asm/fcntl.h> requires
<linux/types.h>, which is incompatible with <stdio.h>.  But it still
works better, in the tradition of autoconf, than having a copy of the
constant for every known architecture and not being able to use the
feature on other architectures.
