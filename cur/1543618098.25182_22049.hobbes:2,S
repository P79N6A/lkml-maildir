ESR == 04 means Send Accept Error.  The P6 manual says:
  Set when the local APIC detects that a message it sent was not
  accepted by any APIC on the bus.
Now, I wonder why it was sending anything at all.  Maybe that CPU was the one 
that does the PIC emulation and has one of the LVT{0,1} entries set to ExtInt.
BTW, be aware that Intel has changed the way the ESR works.  The P6 manual 
says that software must do two back-to-back writes to clear ESR bits.  The 
most recent P4s say that a read clears bits and writes are ignored, save for 
the requirement of a write before the read to get the ESR up to date.  AFAIK, 
Intel's Linux gang hasn't posted any patches to fix smp_error_interrupt() for 
P4s.  I've been meaning to do that myself....

Sounds like the APIC was up to something anyway....

As you would expect performance takes a nosedive from the printks, if nothing 
else, and keeping the APIC bus busy with retransmits increases latency.  They 
use a round robin fairness algorithm so no interrupt source gets starved, but 
because the APIC bus is a serial bus (relatively slow) waiting for a turn can 
take a while.  How long?  Beats me.  The HW guys are no longer leasing an 
APIC bus analyzer pod, so your guess is as good as mine.
