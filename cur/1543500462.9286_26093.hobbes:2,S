How permanent is the association of such regular component with directory?
Can you rename it away? Can you remove it? What happens if you do so? Can
you create links to such animals? Where do they belong in that case? In
other words, are they 1st-class objects or not? If we are losing almost
all filesystem operations on such animals - what's the point of doing them
in fs?
Another thing being: do you want to have them as files in directory or
as small tree in file? IOW, is it namespace issue (first variant) or a
fast equivalent of mounting via loopback device + namespace tricks?
