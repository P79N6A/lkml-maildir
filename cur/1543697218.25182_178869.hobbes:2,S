Tru64 5.1B sendfile(2) page includes:
       [EINTR]
           A signal interrupted  sendfile  before  any  data  was
           transmitted.   If some data was transmitted, the func-
           tion returns the  number  of  bytes  sent  before  the
           interrupt and does not set errno to [EINTR].
There are quite a few more documented return values under Tru64,
although TCP sockets are the only supported destination.  See

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
