Maybe, maybe not.....  A formal style would make it much easier to 
extract docs for others that just want to use the API.

Programmers, like all others, come in many skill levels.  For most 
corporations that want code to run for years, they have to have adequate 
documentation including module and function headers.  Adding a header 
in front of functions (unless a bunch of single line functions), is a 
good practice for maintenance.  Remember my iceburg analogy....
As for hungarian notation -- I have found that code I write using it
is easier to maintain as the type of variables is clearly in the
variable name.  Once, when using PLM on an 8031, we had a strange bug
that we traced to a timer using a char variable, but the valid range
was something like 300 or so -- hungarian notation makes finding
such bugs MUCH easier.  Just because Microsoft adopted this notation
does not make it evil -- it has its place.  It is just another style, 
but it is better suited to applications code, not kernel code

They are a large corporation with many paid programmers of multiple
skill levels.  They have to maintain code written years ago (or, at
least
are supposed to, but they kill off their old products like Win32S).
There is a place for docs.  There is a place for interface specs.
