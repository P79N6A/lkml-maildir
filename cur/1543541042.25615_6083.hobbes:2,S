This is what I understand.

Okay, but this machine has no keyboard and no mouse. Only a cool 19" rack.
So I was wondering why the network and disk events did not add to the 
random pool, as it should.

Ah! So none of the interrupts 5, 10 and 11 (for cpqfc, ida0 and eth0) 
have this flag set, where they should have setted it? Or should not?
From signal.h:
#define SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM SA_RESTART
I'm getting scared now... This means to me that setting SA_RESTART also
sets SAMPLE_RANDOM and vice versa.

Would it be possible and desirable to backport this to 2.2.x?
