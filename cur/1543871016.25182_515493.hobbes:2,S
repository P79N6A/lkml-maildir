No, it's disabled. Will test once I'm done tracking down the iwconfig
problem. From the help text for SYSFS_DEPRECATED:
          If you are using a distro that was released in 2006 or
	  later, it should be safe to say N here.
If we need an as-yet-unreleased HAL without it, I would say the above
should be changed to 2008 or so. If Debian actually cuts a release in
the next few months, you might make that 2010.
