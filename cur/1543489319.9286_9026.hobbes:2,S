No explicit mechanism exists. Only congestion avoidance implied by tcp algo.

Then it looks as another problem, because this particular hole was always

reducing window clamp (on receiving side) to lower value (sort of ~>mss*3):
32K for slow links is actual infinity and means "no flow control at all".
