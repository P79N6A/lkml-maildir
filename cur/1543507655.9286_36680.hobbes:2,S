Yes, indeed!  I just found a spare moment and checked get_cpuinfo() in
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c and arch/sparc64/kernel/setup.c and my memory
didn't fail me, unfortunately.
I can't think of any good argument for keeping "processor" for the
i386 and "cpu" for the sparc64.  Someone should probably fix all the
different ports so that the verbiage is consistent...
But, there's probably a better, more portable, way to calculate the
number of processors for ps.
