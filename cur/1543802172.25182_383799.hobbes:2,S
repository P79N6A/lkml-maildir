You can have a window opened without being ready to accept input yet
for instance.  XEmacs does that[1] when it opens its window before
parsing the user's configuration which can load a number of things and
hence take a while to run.  "Ok I'm going to open your application"
animations allow to win some perceptual time too.
Humans are fundamentally easy to fool for 1-2 seconds as long as they
have feedback.  Longer gets harder :-)
  OG.
[1] For technical reasons, not perceptual.
