But even that isn't enough, as shown by the tulip driver: basically even
the regular PC drivers are available in so many different setups that
you'd still want sub-hierarchies.
(drivers/pc/ would end up being about 99% of the drivers, with the rest
being just smatterings here and there).

I would not disagree entirely. At the same time, there would be advantages
to arch/s390/drivers too. Especially if most people aren't that interested
in them - keep them out of the way.
Keeping them out of the way is bad at times (ie those times when changes
are made that affect everybody). But at other times it would be exactly
what you want. Not polluting the namespace with stuff you don't want or
need is nice.
What I'm saying is that it's not a case of "this is the right solution". 
I think drivers/input _is_ a good solution. I think it sucks as a solution
if it implies moving all the drivers that need it into the same place, but
I think it's potentially the right answer if it's localized to the "core
input handling routines" and people see it that way (kind of the same way
drivers/pci works - not all pci drivers are there, but it is a good way to
partition the _generic_ issues about PCI somewhere which is neutral wrt
what the driver actually ends up doing).
But other issues, like how to move things around.. I'm not going to make
that choice as long as it's not the "obviously right one". As long as it's
not clear what the best choice is, the best bet is always "do as little as
possible, and nothing more".
