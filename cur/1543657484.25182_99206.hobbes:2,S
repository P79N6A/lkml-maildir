Quite some time ago I had a look at their Windows drivers. From the
driver structure, the function names and the actual register accesses I
had the impression that this chip differs largely from the ATA/ATAPI
Host Adapter Standard as decribed in the ANSI committee T13 document
1510D (which happens to be the basis of most of the Linux ATA/ATAPI
drivers). I may be wrong and happily defer to the opposite.
