Hi Roopesh,
I'm terribly sorry I haven't replied sooner. I put your message on my todo list, figuring I could get to it within a day or two, but as you noticed, that didn't quite happen. :/

Ok, so the card is mishandling the state bits a bit. We should be able to work around that.

This might trade us one problem for another. Could you try the following:
} while (!(cmd.resp[0] & R1_READY_FOR_DATA) || (R1_CURRENT_STATE(cmd.resp[0]) == 7));
This should also work for cards that mishandle the state field, and if the card jumps to
some odd state for some reason.

You do. But don't be too alarmed, that is unfortunately the norm. :/
