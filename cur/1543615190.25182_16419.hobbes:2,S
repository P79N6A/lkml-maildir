Use the right tool for the purpose. You bet for rewriting half the
C++ runtime in C instead of not-using the bloated part of C++.
Pretty. If you're going to program in a OO way, use an oo language.
And I get tired of people saying C++ is bloat. My pupils at 5th course
of Computer Science still think C++ is bloat. They have no idea on
compilers. And they bless Ada.
A 5th level virtual function still has only a one-level
indirection overhead when called. Low level code is just as efficient
as C. If a C++ program is bloated it is the programmers matter, not
the language.

Perhaps GTK+, but Xt...
