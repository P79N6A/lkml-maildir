Not at the moment. But I think it is feasible to simply move the ramdisk
detection and unpacking inside the ramfs state machine. In other
words, add two new states:
- detecting type
- unpacking ramdisk
When the first few bytes are fed from the decompressor to the state
machine, we either transition to the normal ramfs unpacking or we
treat it as a ramdisk.
