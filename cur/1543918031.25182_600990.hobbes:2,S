Cool.  That's a much better solution for multiple reasons - like you
mention, MAP_32BIT is only 2GB as well as it's only available on x86_64.

Keeping a kernel happy isn't necessary since it's user-space emulation
rather than full emulation.  It is, however, useful to have 4GB rather
than 2GB.

Qemu has two modes: full hardware emulation and user-mode emulation.
User-mode emulation translates the user-mode code and then remaps the
system calls directly into the native kernel (that way all the kernel
and all the I/O runs natively and faster).  As far as mremap(), I'm
trying to get a 32bit arm mremap() emulated syscall mapped onto a 64bit
x86_64 mremap().
