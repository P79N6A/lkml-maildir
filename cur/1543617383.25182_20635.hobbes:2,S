Hello Linux,
  2.4.xaa Series as well as  SuSE kernels have  3.5G userspace option,
  which seems to be quite useful, therefore I see it's not included
  is stock kernel for some reasons. Also I've heard this
  configuration may have some performance problems.
  Can anyone comment on this topic ?
  I need large amount of address space for my application but I also
  need to get as much I/O performance as it's possible, so I can switch
  to 3.0/1.0 memory distribution if it will benefit here.
