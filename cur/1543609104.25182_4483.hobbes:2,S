Same problem seems to have happened here with 2.4.14 twice, but booting
as usual (no serial console, just keyboard + monitor).
First time I didn't care much because booted with "mem=8m" to test
system behaviour with little memory, and just when qmail was being
started from the init scripts, the system seemed to halt (not even
ALT-SysRq worked, just printed the action requested to the screen). But
I was no patient enough, and ended up rebooting the machine the hard way.
Today I booted my machine again, and this time during fsck the problem
appeared again: this time was a bit more patient and after several
seconds the boot process continued. ALT-SysRq didn't work until the
system "unfroze". This temporary "halt" happened several times during
the boot sequence, each time lasting a variable amount of seconds.
It's been 2 hours since that happened, and the machine is working
nicely so far.
Kernel configuration is the same as it was on, among others, 2.4.10,
2.4.12 and 2.4.13, but this problem only have showed with 2.4.14.
