No, didn't fix it, maybe made it worse.
With pktgen:  Locked up as soon as I started it (or less than .5 seconds afterwards).
With raw ethernet packets, sent from user-space, at around 40Mbps bi-directional,
I see loads of these messages:
tg3: eth3: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth2: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth2: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth3: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth3: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth3: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth3: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth3: Error, poll already scheduled
...
After about 1 minute, the whole machine locked.
