Subject: [PATCHSET] Time: Generic Timeofday Subsystem (v B17)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

All,
	Yes, B17 already. I didn't bother to announce the B16 release, since it
was just a sync w/ the patches included into -mm. This announcement is
mainly for upstream users of my patch (-kthrt and -rt trees), or anyone
who wants to play with the patches outside of -mm. Anyway here it is:
	This patchset provides a generic timekeeping subsystem that is
independent of the timer interrupt. This allows for robust and correct
behavior in cases of late or lost ticks, avoids interpolation errors,
reduces duplication in arch specific code, and allows or assists future
changes such as high-res timers, dynamic ticks, or realtime preemption.
Additionally, it provides finer nanosecond resolution values to the
clock_gettime functions.
	The patch set provides the minimal NTP changes, the clocksource
abstraction, the core timekeeping code as well as the code to convert
i386. I have started on converting more arches, but for now I'm focusing
on code for i386 and x86-64.
Changes since the B16 release:
o Avoids clocksource churn
o Blacklist silent cpufreq changing thinkpad
o Sync up w/ patches in 2.6.16-rc1-mm2
Outstanding issues:
o TSC cpufreq caused stalls at bootup (working on this one)
Still on my TODO list:
o Squish any bugs that pop up from testing in -mm and -rt
o Finer grained ntp adjustment accounting (Suggested by Roman)
o A few spots could use some optimization (Again, suggested by Roman)
o Clean and split up x86-64 patch
o powerpc/ppc, s390, arm, ia64, alpha, sparc, sparc64 work
The patchset applies against the current 2.6.16-rc1-git.
