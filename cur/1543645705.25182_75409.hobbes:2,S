Can you send me the whole backtrace?  I'm curious as to who is calling
those functions from bh context.

I don't know.

Making write() block for any amount of data would increase the
complexity of the drivers.  What should probably be done is convert the
usb-serial drivers to use the new serial core, but I don't have the time
to do this work right now.  Any takers?
