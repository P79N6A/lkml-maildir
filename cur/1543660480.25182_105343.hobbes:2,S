Hello, 
I use Debian woody and just tried to compile my first own kernel. As I
did so the compiler warned me about a failing identifier in
/drivers/sound/awe_wave.c in line 2896 (AWE_REMOVE_INFO). I don't know
much about C and nothing about kernel programming, but I searched in all
#include<*> files after any "patch" struct and found one
(/include/linux/awe_voice.h) in which I inserted one line  (after line58
"#de#define AWE_REMOVE_INFO 7, which helped to compile the kernel
without failures. I don't know how it helped because the struct had
another name. But I just thought it could help you if I write this to
you.
GbY,madroach
