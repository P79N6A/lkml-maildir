I've seen this reported before, but not with any regularity.  Either a
directory is somehow corrupted, or the directory grew beyond what JFS
was designed to handle (which shouldn't really happen).  Do you have any
directories that would have tens of thousands of entries or more?
What is the result of running fsck?

The first two errors used to result in a BUG(), but they have been fixed
to fail more elegantly.  I still need to fix the third.
Thanks,
