Yeah, as sct pointed out this gets thorny.  For a modern harddrive this
probably doesn't matter (since sequential I/O is SO fast compared to
seek times) but for other devices its an issue.

Hmmm... well if someone wants to propose an algorithm to self-tune the
"queue depth in milliseconds" number then maybe we'll get somewhere.
You'd need to do some sort of moving averages of both requests/sec and
sectors/sec that come out of the elevator and use those as feedback to
adjust the queue-depth-value.  I'm not sure if this is advisable, but
at least it sounds feasable.
