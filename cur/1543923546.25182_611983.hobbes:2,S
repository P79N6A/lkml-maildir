What about the DMA padding buffer from nv_adma_port_start and internal
buffers for commands like request sense that don't come via the request
queue directly.
Also it seems nv_adma_use_reg_mode() can decide to send other commands
via the non ADMA interface even for ATA devices. Are we 100% certain it
never decides to let through a command with DMA via the register
interface in this case - what do you see if you instrument the function ?
