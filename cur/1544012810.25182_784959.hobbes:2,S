Usually, you get one of:
 - some bus is locked, and the CPU can't get kernel code from RAM, let 
   alone write anything anywhere
 - triple fault, and the system spontaneously reboots
 - system is unaware that anything's wrong, but nothing runs
 - any attempt to get data useful for debugging hangs
 - system is alive enough that you can interact with it and get info
That doesn't leave a big possibility for the kernel to determine that the 
system has crashed and put something in memory for a warm reboot to find. 
There isn't really any case where the kernel reboots intentionally in a 
context where it thinks the system is crashing but has the ability to do 
lots of information gathering.
About the only common reasons for the kernel to panic these days are a 
missing filesystem or hardware driver, such that it can't find a root 
partition or init, and these really ought to allow the user to debug 
interactively (at least scroll up and look at messages) unless the system 
is configured to reboot.
On your original question: your .config and boot dmesg, and anything 
similar about the situations (like, "both times I was running hwclock" or 
"I was copying big files over XFS..."). If you can trigger it reliably or 
at least repeatably, that's at least as good as a backtrace.
You might post the oopses from your kernel logs, too. Also, 
failing-to-suspend tends to leave useful messages in dmesg and not be too 
hard to explain (at least as compared to failing to resume), and there's 
been a push for getting all drivers to support suspending, even ones for 
desktop hardware, so that can probably be fixed (of course, relatively few 
people actually try suspending desktops, so it's easier for bugs to go 
unnoticed there).
