You don't understand. This has nothing to do with lock holders, or 
anything else.
I'm saying that we map in a page at a magic offset (just above the stack), 
and that page contains the locking code.
For 386 CPU's (where only UP matters), we can trivially come up with a
lock that doesn't use cmpxchg8b and that isn't SMP-safe. It might even go
into the kernel every time if it has to - ie it _works_, it just isn't 
optimal.

That's not the issue AT ALL.
Semaphores are absolutely required on UP too, with threads. There is
_zero_ difference between UP and SMP from a locking perspective in user
space due to the fact that we can be preempted at any time - except from
the cache coherency issue.

That's not the point. Nobody has locked the bus in the last ten years: the 
cache coherency is done on a cacheline basis, not on the bus.
The point being that the difference between a "decl" and a "lock ;  decl"
is about 1:12 or so in performance.

Sure it does. But if the speed of locking matters enough for user-level 
locks to matter, don't you think the 1:12 difference matters as well?
