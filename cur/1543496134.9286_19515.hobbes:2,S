Actually, if you care you can use a clone(2)'ed thread for removing the
process.  On Linux rm is slow at times because for large files on ext2 it
may have to read indirect / double indirect / tripple indirect pointers
blocks in order to find and free all blocks belonging to the file.  More
modern file systems use extends.  With the typical number of extends
being small enough to fit into the inode or one additional block the
performance of rm(2) may make rm look like performing instantaneously.
In short, it's a filesystem issue.
