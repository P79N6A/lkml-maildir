That looks serious: thanks a lot for reporting it.
(I see Marc has sent you a patch or two for the driver end:
I didn't see their relevance, maybe they skirt around the
problem somehow; but unless I'm mistaken, what you've found
goes beyond that particular driver.)
Seems a little odd that it's gone throughout 2.6.22-rc unnoticed
until now - nobody else trying SLUB on ARM or PA-RISC yet perhaps.
As I understand it, you're not doing anything wrong (disclaimer:
I'm no expert on dma_mapping things), but SLUB's reuse of struct
page fields has collided with what flush_dcache_page is expecting.
Here's a patch: I'm not convinced it's necessarily the best one
(most uses of page_mapping will never see a slab page, it's a pity
to be cluttering up that inline even further); but in case nobody
else can provide a better...
[PATCH] page_mapping must avoid slub pages
Nicolas Ferre reports oops from flush_dcache_page() on ARM when using
SLUB: which reuses page->mapping as page->slab.  The page_mapping()
function, used by ARM and PA-RISC flush_dcache_page() implementations,
must not confuse SLUB pages with those which have page->mapping set.

That #ifdef I've put in there is not essential:
it's perhaps more of a comment or an accusation ;)
