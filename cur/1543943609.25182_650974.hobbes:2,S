I wrote that originally when you still had the bogus "AMD fix" 
in the tree.  I think it was because I hoped it would fix that one,
but I wasn't sure because I couldn't reproduce it. But Hugh's
patch fixed that anyways.

With my patch at least NX should be always correct and that is 
the more important one because it is default and has to be cleared
and things go horribly wrong when it is incorrect.
RO on the other hand defaults to off and is only sometimes forced.

Ok if you don't like the try_preserve_large_page change
feel free to drop it or implement it differently.
My main goal here was to clean up the 32bit direct mapping
anyways (last patch) and that does just require splitting out the 
NX checks from the RO checks and having a range (first patches)
I think at least the range checks are definitely needed
for correctness though.
If I cared particularly I would probably implement two modi: 
one with DEBUG_RODATA and another without. With DEBUG_RODATA 
advisory protections should be forced (and large pages split),
without not.
