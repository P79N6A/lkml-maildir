Old news, and it is definitely -not- compatible :/
Every Linux distributor (or other entity) that ships e100 -must-
get an specific exemption from Intel's lawyers, because the license
does not cover patent liability.
So as I understand it (IANAL), with an exemption, Intel can sue an
end user over patent issues.  The GPL would protect against such
business...
Also AFAIK, this is a problem with most if not all IP covered by patents
-and- a BSD license.
Again, IANAL, but this is what I was told from a trusted source, and
backed up by another...
