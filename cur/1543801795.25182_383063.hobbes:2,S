I am not sure where to start digging.
Toshiba Portege 4000, vanilla 2.6.15, Mandriva with suspend-scripts. In 
principle, both STR and hibernation work. STR works just fine for testing - 
suspend, resume after several munutes, and everything works just fine. But if 
I leave system in STR state for several hours, it reliably hangs on resume. I 
have to hard power off it that has value added annoyance that keyboard is 
disabled until I turn it off again (using mouse out of kdm :)
Unless it is a known issue, I appreciate hints where to start debugging. I am 
not deep into Linu power management issues.
TIA
