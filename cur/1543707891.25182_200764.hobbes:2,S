You're entitled.  However, on x86 we booted before when a secondary
CPU didn't come up, and the patch was designed to ensure that we still
did so.

No, it's possible, but not online.  This actually happens on archs
where you have hotplug cpus, as well as x86 boot failures.

Sure, send a patch for x86 to do that, and we can discuss that.  I'm
not going to break existing behavior by stealth though.
