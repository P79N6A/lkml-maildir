Subject: [CFT][PATCH] ext2 directories in pagecache

	Duh. After fixing two idiotic bugs in ext2_readdir() it seems to
be really working (survives assorted builds, does the right thing on
find-based scripts and obvious local tests, yodda, yodda). It certainly
needs more testing, but I would call it (early) beta.
	Folks, give it a try - just keep decent backups. Similar code will
have to go into UFS in 2.4 and that (ext2) variant may be of interest for
2.4.<late>/2.5.<early> timeframe.
	I'm putting it on ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/ext2-patch-7.gz.
Comments and help in testing are more than welcome.
							Cheers,
								Al
