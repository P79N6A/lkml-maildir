Even if I do the ptrace audit right now, within 6 months something can
change and the implications of the changes won't be as trivial to
evaluate as if entry.S or seccomp.c have changed.
The userland side will be a lot more complicated too to implement.
Do you want video compressed strems to be played securely and
efficiently? I can't see a better solution than seccomp. ptrace would be
slower and it'd require ugly code to be written in userland. Streams
are going to pump some stuff into the pipes and this will avoid
quite a number of schedules per second (regardless of buffering). The
seccomp API is just tricky enough without having to hardcoded into every
userland app the number of the syscalls. Seccomp at least gives a slight
chance to write arch indipendent code while still providing lowlevel
security from the OS, there's no way to use ptrace_syscall in a arch
indipendent manner.
In the last patch I sent privately to Andrew I made it a config option,
but I recommend not to disable it, or you won't be able to run the
Cpushare client. Andrew's right seccomp.o would waste precious bytes
(not kbytes) on embedded systems, so it has to be a config option for
that. You can still modify it to use ptrace freely, but then I will have
nothing to do with the problems that may arise over time by using ptrace
within the GPL'd Cpushare client code and I personally do not approve
the use of ptrace there (but it's GPL so you can modify it).  I'm doing
something that I can trust to run on my own desktop system, and
personally seccomp is the only thing I'm confortable to depend on. Plus
the userland gets so much simpler as well. It's not only a problem of
trusting the kernel space of ptrace.
