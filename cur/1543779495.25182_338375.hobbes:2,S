This locks the system up after the "INIT: version 2.86 booting" message.
SysRq still responds but that's about it.
The system also feels/looks extremely sluggish after this change (more
looping?).
With your previously suggested change:
        } else {
                inc_page_state(cmpxchg_fail_flag_update);
+               set_pte_at(mm, address, pte, new_entry);
        }
 
the system proceeds past INIT and boots normally but X still locks up...
