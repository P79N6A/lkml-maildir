Subject: 2.4.20 sched.c never resets cpus_runnable for UP

kernel/sched.c uses task_set_cpu() and task_release_cpu() to modify the
cpus_runnable flag.  On UP, task_set_cpu() is called but
task_release_cpu() is not, it is wrapped in #ifdef CONFIG_SMP.  The
result is that all tasks have cpus_runnable=1 and task_has_cpu()
reports true for all tasks.
