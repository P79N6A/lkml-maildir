Note that you use *s3* and *s9*. Those will be two different context cookies. 
SeLinux will have its own way to set the cookie in the mm_struct, to *s3* 
in one case, and to *s9* in the other case. This will make things so that 
they'll never see each other pages.

I'd rather prefer to not create anything, and to not add anything. SeLinux 
can set the cookie as it likes, and it can also disable the feature. Since 
SeLinux is definitely not the common case, I'd prefer to keep the simple 
unsigned long cookie abstraction, and let them handle however they like it.
