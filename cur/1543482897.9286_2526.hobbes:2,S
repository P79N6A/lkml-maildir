I think rolling it all into one large patch would be a bad thing, who's
going to oversee integration? Linus.  woudl you want to stare at upwards
of 1 megs of diffs spread across 5  revisions?
I think if anything like that was done, only dependant features should be
rolled.  if something doesn't depend on anotehr fetaure, it should remain
a sole feature for Linus to look over (or whoever would be maintainer)
