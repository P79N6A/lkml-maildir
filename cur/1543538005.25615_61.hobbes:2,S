One thing I've noticed...and if you recall a while back, I posted a
similar problem with 2.2.15.  I blamed it on a new CDRW drive I had
just installed (before installing the drive, on hdd, I hadn't had
any problem.)  In my configuration, I have HDs as masters on both
IDE channels (both Quantums as well, if that helps) and CD drives
(one CRROM, one CDRW) as the slaves.
But one thing I have noticed that is a common thread:  A **LOT**
of the folks having this problem have Intel PIIX4 IDE controllers.  
Including me.  
I did upgrade to 2.2.16 and it improved things, but it still
crashes occasionally.  Usually during periods of disk activity;
I don't know if it is reading or writing though...
BTW (for Andre):   The IDE patch(es) on kernel.org in your directory--
what do they do???
