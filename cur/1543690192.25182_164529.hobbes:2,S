More problems with that stupid MODE-SENSE cache page!  There are so many 
USB storage devices that have problems with that -- I wonder if it's worth 
the effort to try to continue supporting it?
Georgi, the problem is with your mp3 player, not usb-storage or SCSI.  
It's crashing when given a perfectly legal SCSI command.  Linux 2.4
doesn't issue the command; that's why it works okay.
If you want a temporary fix for 2.6.0, you can do this:  Edit the 
routine sd_read_cache_type in the file drivers/scsi/sd.c (near line 1100).  
Get rid of (or #ifdef out) most of the function; just leave the last few 
lines where it does:
		printk(KERN_ERR "%s: assuming drive cache: write through\n",
		       diskname);
		sdkp->WCE = 0;
		sdkp->RCD = 0;
You might want to change the KERN_ERR to KERN_NOTICE.
However, you might also want to think twice before doing this if you have 
any other SCSI disks, because making this change will affect all of them.
