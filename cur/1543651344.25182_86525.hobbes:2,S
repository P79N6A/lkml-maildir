	I believe I can eliminate some block device initialization
code and also eliminate some ioctls that allow for a lot of number
configured states for a loop device and bloat loop.c with some
features nobody uses (for example, there is an unused facility to
"name" each loop device).  I would like to invent as little new API as
possible.  Also, of much less importance, adopting this change would
relinquish a major device number.
	I was going to have the map function always return 0 (i.e., it
will submit the IO itself).  Given device-mapper with linear mapping,
I don't think anyone will need to use loop just to map a device to a
device with no data transformation, so there is no need for loop
optimize for that case.
	If you want to point out specific technical problems with this
or have other advice, great.  Otherwise, I expect that just trying to
implement it will either show me some problem with it or will result
in a patch that should clarify what I am talking about for you.
	By the way, one change to DM that might be useful for other
targets as well as loop.c would be to move the map function from
target_type to dm_target.  This can potentially be used to eliminate
some branches in the IO path based on configuration options that were
passed to the constructor function.  For loop.c, I am thinking of
file backed versus device backed.  I could also imagine raid schemes
that might optimize their map functions differently for different
segment sizes.
