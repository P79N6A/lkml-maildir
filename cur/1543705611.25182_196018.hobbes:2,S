Very nice.  But I see the name thing is really official now:
   2 alastair@gluck:~/linux-2.6> head Makefile
   VERSION = 2
   PATCHLEVEL = 6
   SUBLEVEL = 2
   EXTRAVERSION =
   NAME=Feisty Dunnart
Its own line in the Makefile, no less.  So, no doubt you're planning to 
actually _use_ this in some devious way?  Worrying indeed....
BTW, I did my first attempt at an ATAPI CD burn last night, on one of 
Feisty Dunnart's release candidates, and it was wildly successful.  I'm 
sure this isn't news, but it was great to see.
2.6 is looking great from here, no visible problems for me.
Cheers
Alastair
