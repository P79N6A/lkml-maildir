I'm not sure I believe that.  You need to tinker with hardware tables 
before you know what physical RAM is being used.  Sequential virtual 
pages might be mapped to sequential physical RAM, but it might also be 
mapped psuedo-randomly, or even page-reverse-sequential!  How can you do 
a basic walking bit test when you could be accessing pages in random order?

Don't microcode updates fix CPU bugs?  That's not fixing faulty RAM.  If 
base microcode is so faulty as to make RAM access unreliable, the CPU 
probably won't even POST, let alone boot the kernel and start a whole 
bunch of userspace stuff, before it can get around to checking to see if 
there is new microcode for that CPU and download it.
I suppose a CPU retains microcode updates, once loaded, until power-down 
or some hard reboot that you surely can avoid.  If it does happen that 
you have an update that works around something unrelated to the CPU, for 
example maybe interaction with a bridge, then you can update the CPU 
before running memtest.  Once loaded it's there until power down.

I'm sure you don't mean that.  I'm sure you don't want a faulty power 
supply to look like faulty RAM.  No amount of replacing pieces of memory 
is going to solve a faulty power supply.  At worst you'll hit on a 
combination of pieces that pass the test ... and then the system will 
fail, mysteriously, in production.  I'm certain you don't want that.
Anyhow, good luck with your idea.  I think it's crazy, and that you're 
doomed to failure.  Doomed! I tell you.
