There are two things you can do about this:
 1. Disable module versioning.
 2. Copy the System.map file that's made during the kernel build to
    /boot/System.map-2.4.0-test10.
Personally, I do 2.  Though, now I'm attempting to get the maestro
driver working again and this is getting in my way.  So my question to
those that know more is what is the correct way to build a module such
that it'll insmod in the face of module versioning.  Is this something
for the FAQ?

I've been ignoring this (I'm sure at my peril).

You can try enabling BSD process accounting in your configuration.  I
have not and also get this message (and don't care).

As above.

My laptop (a Fujitsu E6520 stop powering off with RH7 regardless of
whether I used the supplied kernel or the test10 that I built), so
consider yourself lucky ;-)
Also, the default compiler on RH7 is not correct.  Use kgcc instead
(ie. make CC=kgcc bzImage).  The gcc2.96 is said/known not to work for
kernel work.
