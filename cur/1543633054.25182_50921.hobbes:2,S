hmm, that's a bad news, that's egcs 1.1.2, strange, it was supposed to
be safe oh well, but OTOH I'm not too surprised nobody noticed because I
doubt many people compiles with 2.4 with egcs still.

Could you try compiling in another machine with a gcc 2.95 and see if
you can still reproduce it? If it's a race condition and a real kernel
bug it should be easily reproducible no matter the compiler.
