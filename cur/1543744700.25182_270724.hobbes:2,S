  I had 28 mirror sets on Compaq SMART2/p controllers in one server (four
controllers, two SCSI channels each, seven disks per channel.)  All the disks
on channel A of each controller were mirrored to those on channel B, so even
complete failure of one channel didn't cause a problem.
  Once a disk was marked 'failed' in the controller NVRAM there was no way to
convince it that some newly-inserted disk contained valid data.
  Booting up with SCSI cables connected wrongly (channels A and B swapped) got you
a nice error message informing you of this fact.  Swapping SCSI IDs on different
disks on the same channel was also detected and reported nicely.
  And attempting to boot with a bad cable (bent pin) gave a message saying 'either
power down NOW and check cables or I will mark every disk on that channel as
failed.'
  Of course this system was 100% Compaq; even the disks had Compaq firmware
though the labels said IBM.  And it was very expensive...
