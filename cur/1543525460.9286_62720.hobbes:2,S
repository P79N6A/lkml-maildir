Hi,
The linux-usb project has had 2-3 reports of USB
not working on SMP systems if they are in MPS 1.4
mode (BIOS SETUP option).  The latest report was
2000-Feb-4.
After being changed to MPS 1.1 mode, USB works as expected.
Does anyone here have any ideas about why this is
happening and what we can do about it?
Thanks,
Randy

in MPS 1.4 mode 
Hi,
   I'm seeing the following problem with the usb that is in
kernel 2.3.41 and kernel 2.3.42 if I have my BP6 motherboard
set to MPS v1.4.  It would appear that with these settings,
no interrupts are being generated, which is causing the following
error to be generated:
       usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
       usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
       usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
       usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
       usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
usb.c: USB device not responding, giving up (error=-110)
hub.c: hub: disabling port 2
Setting the bios to MPS v1.1 and everything works.  If I boot up
kernel 2.2.14 + the 2.3.39 backport patch in MPS v1.4 mode, USB
works correctly and Win2k works correctly with MPS v1.4 as well.
I remember reporting this before, but back then, USB didn't work
in MPS v1.4 in win2k either, and now it does, which is why I'm 
reporting it again.  I tried both the AFS UHCI and JE UHCI in
2.3.42, and both drivers show the same behavior.  I've also
reported this problem to ABit, in case it is purely a bios problem,
but the fact is that 2.3.x is the only one showing this problem.
If anyone has any bright ideas, I'd appreciate hearing them. :)
