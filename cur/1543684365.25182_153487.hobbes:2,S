Doesn't look like anything specific to kernel preemption to me.
But if need_resched() is never zero, the while loop fails, and
schedule() _should_ be reached. So something is fishy here. Looking at
it the other way, however, if schedule() is never called, then
need_resched() will remain non-zero forever. Maybe you mean
need_resched() is never non-zero, i.e., it is always zero?
I think the problem is that there is a race between whatever you are
saying ACPI is doing with pm_idle and the setting of idle. Actually,
that is exactly what you are saying :)
Your fix smells exactly of that. Maybe have APCI set need_resched, so
the loop flips over again?
