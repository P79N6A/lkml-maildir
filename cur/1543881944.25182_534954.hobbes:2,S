While rare is the day admittedly, that my machine isn't on, there are
days I take a break from loooong days and won't work for 2-5 days at
a time.
My main revenue machine is a laptop with a fast, but last-generation
mobile processor and 2GB of DDR2 SDRAM.
I think it's ridiculous to expect that I could resume off battery (and
this thing is a behemoth, with a 17" screen and backlight and a lot of
little juice-eating peripherals that'll go thru a 4.4A/Hr battery in a
little over 90 mins, even with conservative power settings) after that
kind of delay. I don't even like "suspend to RAM, then suspend to disk
on battery low" 'cause that means when I turn it on again I have a low
battery for an hour and a half.
The only acceptable power usage when (completely) idle, IMO, is *zero*.
