It's probably worth mentioning that this scheduler shows a not insignificant 
improvement in the mysql test case that recently received a lot of publicity. 
Why exactly that's the case I'm not sure but it may help track down what is 
actually responsible for the performance drop off as well. Note that the SMP 
balancing of this cpu scheduler is essentially unchanged from the mainline 
one.
