it depends on how strang your requirements are for uniqueness. worst case
you form your new ID and then check it against all others that have been
formed.
also it depends on if you are concerned about just the local machine or
global uniqueness.
if you are just concerned about the local machine you can just increment a
counter (with the appropriate locking and a large enough field to not
wrap)
if you care about global uniqueness then you add in config values that the
sysasmin sets to make it unique (could be MAC address, IP address, machine
name, GPS coordinates, etc)
the only reason to add in a random value is if you are trying to protect
yourself from a malicious sysadmin and there are security problems that
will arise for other machines if a sysadmin can duplicate this ID.
