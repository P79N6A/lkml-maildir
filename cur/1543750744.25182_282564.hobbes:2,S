Subject: [PATCH][5/?] count writeback pages in nr_scanned
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Still untested, but posting the concept here anyway, since this
could explain a lot...
OOM kills have been observed with 70% of the pages in lowmem being
in the writeback state.  If we count those pages in sc->nr_scanned,
the VM should throttle and wait for IO completion, instead of OOM
killing.
