"Some vendors distribute binary modules (i.e. modules without available
source code under a free software license). As the source is not freely
available, any bugs uncovered whilst such modules are loaded cannot be
investigated by the kernel hackers. All problems discovered whilst such
a module is loaded must be reported to the vendor of that module, not
the Linux kernel hackers and the linux-kernel mailing list. The
tainting scheme is used to identify bug reports from kernels with
binary modules loaded: such kernels are marked as "tainted" by means of
the MODULE_LICENSE tag. If a module is loaded that does not specify an
approved license, the kernel is marked as tainted. The canonical list
of approved license strings is in linux/include/linux/module.h. "oops"
reports marked as tainted are of no use to the kernel developers and
will be ignored. A warning is output when such a module is loaded. Note
that you may come across module source that is under a compatible
license, but does not have a suitable MODULE_LICENSE tag. If you see a
warning from modprobe or insmod for a module under a compatible
license, please report this bug to the maintainers of the module, so
that they can add the necessary tag."
