As someone who  works for a Fortune 50 communications company I really do
not understand what the problem is. Subscriber units whatever they maybe
are just that "Subscriber Units".  In the case of a mobile unit such as
a Cellular Telephone the only  thing that anybody really cares about is that
one does not change its identity by cloning it.  With GSM phones this is even
bent with personal identity cards that can be inserted into the device.  In
the US one has the CALEA Wiretap Laws but they mainly apply on the infra-structure
side of the telecommunications network.   It is just plain silly to make subscriber
units only telco provided and installed.  The reasoning is that it requires too
much labor for something that can be done in an error free way by any moron off of
the street.   For a mobile unit many countries  require some way to tell where
it is broadcasting from but again that is done from the infrastructure side as
a subscriber unit could be modified to lie about its position and therefore it
is not even worth the effort to have it report it.  
If your German telco does not understand the economics of the  problem perhaps
you should consider how to replace it.
