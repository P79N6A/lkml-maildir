Yep.  You can also do this with etherboot flashed on one a nick card as well.
I also intend to use my work for this functionality as well.  
FYI I work for linux networx which builds hardware for linux clusters.
The fact that Scyld is using arp and a fixed network socket is a 
design decision I don't agree with.   
Truly slick will be when linuxBIOS is solid.  Then you even get remote
control of the BIOS, and remote booting all from within the BIOS.  Only
time will tell if it is worth the effort :)
