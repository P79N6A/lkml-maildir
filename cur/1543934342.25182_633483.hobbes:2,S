I suspect the /dev/rtc node was provided by the distro, so those
udev rules won't trigger.

I run my x86 systems like that (also with RTC_DRV_CMOS), but
the ARM systems usually have RTC_HCTOSYS set too (plus some
RTC driver other than rtc-cmos).  The x86 system init code
pokes directly at the legacy RTC hardware in several cases.

If there was a Grand Plan, I never heard of it. :)
It'd need to have some NTP sync solution for RTC_LIB devices, but
ISTR the gentime stuff still assumes an update_persistent_clock()
that doesn't sleep ... and hence can't be used with I2C based RTCs.
I've been trying to make sure the x86 world could realistically
switch to the RTC framework used by other Linux platforms, hence
e.g. the util-unix-ng updates, but never assumed there would be
no userspace changes.  After all, userspace was using a mishmash
of tools that were far from platform-agnostic, and moving away
from x86-dependency implies such things will change.
However I *do* think that symlinking rtc to /dev/rtc0 should
make it practical to use most older binaries.
