  Sure.  But, please let me ask you something before I
post the update patch.  I think register_node() also
should be always there if unregister_node() is always
there.  So, the '__devinit' attribute for register_node()
does not seem to be necessary.  (Actually, the attribute
'__init' of register_node() was replaced with '__devinit'
in my previous patch.)  What do you think of this?
Thanks,
