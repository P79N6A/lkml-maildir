Its more than a few hundred lines. Mind you it wouldn't be hard to patch
2.4.X to use the new PS/2 drivers but it is a pretty big change. I
seriously don't it would go in. Your welcomed to try out these drivers. I
have personally been using these new PS/2 drivers for several months now
with now problems. In fact this driver can trick my i8042 chipset to allow
me to plug two PS/2 keyboards in :-)
