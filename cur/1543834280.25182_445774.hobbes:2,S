Hello Dmitry,
I'm afraid I'm off the project that used the ELO touch screen for now.
Since the patch I posted was working reliably for me, I wanted to try
another attempt at pushing it up so that it didn't just whither on the
vine. I may come back to the project that used the ELO touch screen at
some point, but that might be a few months away. If/when I do, I'll
certainly test your patch. Sorry that I can't do so now.
Cheers,
Shaun
