On an i386 kernel you likely just don't have enough address space 
available to map something that big. Your kernel address space is only 
1GB (with the standard 3G/1G user/kernel split) and it somehow has to 
fit in there along with all the other I/O regions, etc. that are mapped 
into kernel address space.
You may just have to remap smaller chunks of the BAR on demand and unmap 
them when you're finished with them.
An x86_64 kernel likely would not have this problem..
