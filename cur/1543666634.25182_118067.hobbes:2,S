At the risk of stating the obvious: the only program that cares about
the 'Code:' line is ksymoops.  It already handles code around the EIP
by looking for a byte enclosed in <> and assuming that byte is at EIP.
ksymoops can happily decode around the failing instruction and does so
for most architectures with fixed length instructions.
I can change ksymoops to add a special case for architectures with
variable length instructions - i386, s390 and their 64 bit equivalents,
are there any others?  For variable length instructions, ksymoops will
extract the bytes up to but not including eip, decode and print them
with a warning
  This architecture has variable length instructions, decoding before eip is
  unreliable, take these instructions with a pinch of salt.
Then the code from eip onwards will be decoded as normal, with the
heading 'This code should be reliable'.  If a kernel with variable
length instructions prints 'Code:' with a byte enclosed in <> then you
get two decodes with suitable warning messages.  No <> in the code line
means no change from current decode state, everybody is happy.
