I think that's what I said.  I guess you're saying it more forcefully;
you seem to be implying "the basic idea of allnoconfig is broken."

I think that's also what I said.

I guess it depends on your goals.  My goal is to use allnoconfig
as a toolchain regression test.  For each arch, I want an easy way
to build some kernel (any kernel!) for that arch.  ARCH_RPC
is the default on arm (yes, I know you think the whole
concept of defaults on arm is broken), so it's the only one that
needs fixing.
Any feedback from people who don't think allnoconfig is a useless idea?
Thanks,
Dan
