access_ok() doesn't seem to mean copy_to_user will return 0.
438 unsigned long copy_to_user(void *to, const void *from, unsigned long n)
439 {
440         prefetch(from);
441         if (access_ok(VERIFY_WRITE, to, n))
442                 n = __copy_to_user(to, from, n);
443         return n;
444 }
I have a script that finds all the unchecked calls to copy_to_user() and
I am curious about what cases it does not need to be checked.
