Oh, that's a mis-merge. Thanks for catching it. The name should have
been: process_adjtimex_modes().
process_adjtimex_adj_offset was basically the same as your
ntp_update_offset() function, so I killed it but grabbed the wrong
function name.

does process_adjtimex_modes(), or ntp_process_adjtimex_modes work for
you?
