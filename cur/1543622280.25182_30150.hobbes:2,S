Hi,
Well, basically if I use usb-uhci instead of uhci, the computer
locks during the shutdown process.  I believe I've used the stock
Mandrake 8.1 kernel as well as 2.4.17 and 2.4.18-rc1 with similar
results.  Mandrake even seems to make a note of the issue:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/errata.php3
"Error scenario: The computer locks up when shutting down or when
  stopping the usb service.
Why: In certain cases, the usb-uhci module is broken for some usb
  devices. 
Solution: Modify your /etc/modules.conf file and change the line
  "alias usb-interface usb-uhci" to "alias usb-interface uhci". The
  change will take effect after the next shutdown and will prevent the
  usb service from locking up the computer."
I have a Brother HL-1450 Postscript printer and an HP Scanjet 6300C
attached, FWIW.
The reason I'd like to switch back to usb-uhci instead of uhci is
twfold:  Vmware seems to want to only use usb-uhci and not uhci
(dummies!).  And uhci seems to be unable to get the scanner going
such that it doesn't "stutter" all the way down the page.  usb-uhci
seems to be able to keep up so that it just sweeps on down the page.
I saw the thread on usb-uhci on 2.5, and it looked so similar that I
(incorrectly) assumed them to be one and the same problem.
Thanks,
Dan
