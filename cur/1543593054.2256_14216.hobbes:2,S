thanks - I gave it lots of thought.

the old-style init is because it is an old driver.  I want to do a full-on
rework, but haven't had the time.

i2c is only in our stuff because the i2c core is not in the standard kernel
yet.  As soon as it is, I will make cobalt_i2c* go away.

as I said - I didn't write the LCD driver, I just had to port it up :)  I
want to re-do the whole paradigm of it (it has been ported forward since 
2.0.3x)

I don't get it - are you saying you do or don't like the while (p)
approach?  I think it is clearer because it is more true ot the heuristic -
"start at the beginning and walk down the list".

I've tried to eliminate that when I see it - I'll give the diff a close
examination.
thanks for the feedback - it will be nice to not have to constantly port
all our changes to each kernel release.  There are still some patches (of
course) but I didn't submit them because they are VERY specific to cobalt -
for example in the ide probing calling cobalt_ruler_register().  Ifdefs
protect, but the overall appearance would be rejected, I suspect - no?
