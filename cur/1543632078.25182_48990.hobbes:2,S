- Merge ide-probe.c and ide-features.c in to one single file.  They are
   mutually doing basically the same and in esp. in case of the device ID
   retrieval there *is* quite a lot of code duplication between them.
   ide-geometry.c fits there as well.
- Remove ide_xfer_verbose - it wasn't really used.
- Don't allow check_partition to be more clever then the writer of a driver.
   It was interfering with drivers which check partitions as they go and
   finally if we want to spew something about it - we can do it ourself.
- Eliminate ide_geninit(). We scan for partitions now inside the recently
   introduced attach method. register_disk() is broken by the way and 90% of
   places where it's used it is doing literally nothing. Either some one didn't
   finish some code or the code is basically just junk from the past.
   Anyway we grok the partitions now one by one as we detect the channels.
- ide_driveid_update is gone. We don't report the drive id through /proc/ide
   and we don't have to update it any longer on the fly. Still someone out there
   complaining that it went away!?
- Use the global driver spin-lock to protect data structure access in the
   ide_register_subdriver() function instead of blatantly disabling all
   interrupts.
