I didn't know AOSS, but 
http://www.baycom.org/~tom/ham/soundmodem/
 fails
with ALSA's kernel OSS emulation. Given that ALSA's kernel OSS emulation
is buggy since a couple of years and nobody feels like fixing it and you
seem to be telling that aoss is better anyway, are we going to remove
snd_pcm_oss as well?
