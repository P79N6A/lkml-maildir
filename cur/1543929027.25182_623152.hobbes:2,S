BCPL was typeless, as was the successor B (between Bell Labs and GE we 
write thousands of lines of B, ported to 8080, GE600, etc). C introduced 
types, and the rest is history. Multics is written in PL/1, and I wrote 
a lot of PL/1 subset G back when as well. You don't know slow compile 
until you get a seven pass compiler with each pass on floppy.
