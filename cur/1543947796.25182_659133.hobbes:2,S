This thread's main bug no longer appears. There's a new bug though,
but it looks nicer than the original ugly bug!. 
The new bug does *not* appear in mainline with the same patch. It's
a panic, but this time on the _guest_ side (which is the same host's
kernel).

I'll track it further in my first free time slot.
It seems lguest is very sensitive to x86 tree changes. Could it be 
included in a sort of automatic guest-boot testing, please ?
Thank you,
