The following always works first time on an affected kernel (I'm just
mimmicing that update-grub did at the point it hung on me):
cd /to_ext2_fs_mounted_with_sync
cp /boot/grub/menu.lst menu.lst.new
cat menu.lst.new >menu.lst
rm menu.lst.new

I just ran the above 1000 times on 2.6.13-git10 (also affected), on
ext3, no hung rm process.
Running on ext2, rm hangs first time.

OK will do.
Initial testing suggests that 2.6.13-git9 is good while 2.6.13-git10
that I'm running now fails.  I'll verify this and have a look at dmesg
output as well.
