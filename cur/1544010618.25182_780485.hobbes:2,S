 ok, then don't break.

 mm. that's strange. a platform driver is supposed to receive informational
 structures (regions, irqs, ...) and init driver data by itself. you shouldn't need
 to mess with the drvdata pointer.
 I do not also feel fine with the irq handlers setup. Your core should export
 a function for irq registration.
