OK, that makes sense.   It's one of the few sane ways of doing this.
How does the attached hastily-thrown-together-not-doing-timers-at-present
patch look?
Notes:
- We really should get rid of the eighteen trillion RUN_AT macros
  and turn them into real functions - add_timer_at(), mod_timer_at().
  Do the addition to `jiffies' in a single place.
- The test3-pre4 implementation has a potential bug:
    volatile struct timer_list * running_timer;
  should have been
    struct timer_list * volatile running_timer;
  Fortunately gcc throws its hands up and runs away as
  soon as it gets a whiff of `volatile'.
- The following architectures don't provide spin_unlock_wait:
  * asm-arm
  * asm-m68k
  * asm-mips
  * asm-sh
  And hence won't compile with the attached patch and CONFIG_SMP.  It
  appears that these architectures don't support SMP anyway.
BTW: how do we make decisions about inlining things?  I often see
what appear to be dubious inlining decisions.  For example,
internal_add_timer().  That's a BIG function. Is there a net
benefit in having up to three copies sitting in the icache?--- linux-2.4.0-test3-pre4/include/linux/timer.h	Thu Jul  6 20:23:47 2000
