It certainly is more consistent but its a big performance hit if that
scaling is done on every invocation of clock_gettime or gettimeofday().
With the improved scaling factor one should be able to come very close to
ntp scaled time without invoking ntp_scale itself. Tick processing will
then update time to be ntp scaled by fine tuning the scaling factor (with
the bit shifting we can get very fine tuning) and eventually skip a few
nanoseconds. Its basically some piece of interpolator logic in there so
that the heavyweight calculations can just be done once in a while.

The timesource is really a memory location incremented by "increment
counter" and not part of tick processing.  Logically these are seperate.
"increment counter" could happen apart from tick processing.
They are just conflated in the current tick implementation.
