Yes, this fixes it.  Thanks.
FYI, gcc uses glibc headers to get at struct sigcontext, but
on i386 (and many other arches) glibc's <bits/sigcontext.h> just includes
<asm/sigcontext.h>.  On x86_64, ia64 and sparc* glibc doesn't include
asm/sigcontext.h, but provides its own definitions, so for gcc itself
only changing 32-bit parts woiuld be enough.  That said, there are certainly
programs which include asm/sigcontext.h directly (plus there are other c
libraries, some of which may use asm/sigcontext.h).
