TCP has the same problem.

It will work OK.  It isn't very scalable of course, but I assume you're
dealing with relatively low bandwidths.
I would suggest that you look at avoiding the global semaphore.  Suppose
someone has 64 interfaces or something.  Is that possible?  It might be
better to put the semaphore into struct capi_ctr so you can at least
process frames from separate cards in parallel.

Not really - you've been bitten by the compulsory per-cpuness of the
workqueue handlers.
You could have a standalone kernel thread or always queue the work onto CPU
#0 (the function to do this isn't merged, but exists).  But both these are
unscalable.
So apart from moving recv_handler_lock into struct capi_ctr I can't think
of anything clever.
