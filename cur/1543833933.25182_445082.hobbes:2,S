From the manpage:

The series file is looked up in the root of the  source  tree, in  the
patches  directory,  and  in  the .pc directory.  The first series file
that is found is used. This may also be a symbolic link, or a file with
multiple  hard  links.  Usually, only one series file is used for a set
of patches, so the patches sub-directory is a convenient location.

Also it's convienient to put "series" in the root of the source tree if
"patches/" is shared among several source trees.
