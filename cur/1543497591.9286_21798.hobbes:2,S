I started seeing these messages a lot when I upgraded my system to
RH6.0.  I started noticing that my clock would drift up to 6 hours
backwards every few hours.  I would set it to local time and a few
hours later it would be skewed again, once I forced setting the
HW clock to GMT the problem went away.
