Hmm...that allocation call occurs upon alloc_inode() via
security_inode_alloc, and the associated free call occurs upon
destroy_inode() via security_inode_free.  However, when Jeff Mahoney
introduced the support for "private inodes" (S_PRIVATE flag) to support
reiserfs xattrs-as-files, he added the IS_PRIVATE guards to both
security_inode_alloc and security_inode_free.  I think that this ends up
causing SELinux to allocate a security structure for every reiserfs
inode including private inodes since they are not marked until later by
reiserfs, while preventing SELinux from ever freeing the security
structure for the private inodes.  Note that
selinux_inode_free_security() should be safe even for the private
inodes, as it doesn't assume any other initialization beyond the
allocation-time initialization.  Patch below.  
BTW, Jeff - I assume you know about the unrelated breakage in
SELinux/reiserfs support that was introduced by the changes for atomic
security labeling of inodes in 2.6.14.  If you care, you might want to
use the same workaround upstreamed for xfs for 2.6.16.  But I understand
that SELinux is not a priority in SuSE presently.
BTW, Chris - are you still serving as LSM maintainer?  MAINTAINERS still
lists your osdl address.

Remove private inode tests from security_inode_alloc and security_inode_free,
as we otherwise end up leaking inode security structures for private inodes.
