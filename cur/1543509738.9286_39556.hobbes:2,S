  No, you don't.
  Counter example:  Something is unloaded, and after a while, something
                    else is loaded into same memory area.
  Now how you know that the pointer is valid ?
  I would say: you don't.
  A way out could be eternally growing array of pointers, which may then
  latter be removoked by writing a NULL back into place at module unload.
  ... but it would be eternally growing non-swappable array...  Not good.
  You must find some other approach.   What is the original problem, which
  is now "solved" with cached function pointers ?
