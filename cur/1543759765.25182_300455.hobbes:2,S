Linus already has this:

   [PATCH] pcnet32: 79c976 with fiber optic fix
   After testing this patch I agree that it should be applied.  The one
   change I made was to print the device name (ethN) instead of 'pcnet32'.
   Tested ia32.

   Skip PHY selection on Allied Telesyn 2701FX, it looses the link 
otherwise.
   Fix up the AT 2700FX as well.
