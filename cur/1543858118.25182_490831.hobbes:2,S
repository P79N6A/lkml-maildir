This is increasingly becoming a problem.  For cases where we have >1 driver
trying to 'own' a single PCI ID, the first to init generally wins.
Similar problems exist with intel agp vs edac, intel agp vs intel watchdog,
matroxfb vs W1, and probably more..
What's needed is a governing module that claims the device and arbitrates
for drivers 'below' it.
