both ideas make all the sense to me. I'll give it a try, but in what way can 
we test this kind of enhancement? maybe write a small program that starts 
fills a good part of swap space and then, after 1min idle, 'watch free -m' 
should show free memory decreasing (not counting cache/buffers) with idle 
activity. decent?
about the Hans's proposal - it would increase power consumption, because of 
increased disk activity. about con's swap prefetch, I'm not so sure...
