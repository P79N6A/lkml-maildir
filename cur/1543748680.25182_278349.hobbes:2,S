Userspace can only set settings in the kernel when the kernel allows this.
Procfs is not a storage filesystem, it stores settings and exposes
information.
The kernel does not 'read' files in /proc per se, it has direct access to
the relevant settings.
Procfs is like a window on the kernel, and in some cases you can hand the
kernel new settings.
