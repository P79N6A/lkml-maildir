I think it's the simplest solution to allowing a driver
to indicate which resources it wants to use. It solves
the problem of I/O Port resource allocation sufficiently
well.

You want the arch PCI support to clobber the I/O port space resources?
How will the arch PCI support know that a particular device's driver
only uses MMIO resources?

Several people have already agreed the driver needs to indicate which
resource it wants to work with. I don't see how the arch PCI support
can provide that "knowledge".
