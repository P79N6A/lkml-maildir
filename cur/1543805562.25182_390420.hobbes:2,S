Put that way, you seem to be describing exactly single level storage as 
seen in an IBM Eserver I Series (fka AS/400, nee System/38).
So we know it works, but also that people don't seem to care much for it 
(because in 35 years, it hasn't taken over the world - we got to today's 
machines with 64 bit address spaces for other reasons).
