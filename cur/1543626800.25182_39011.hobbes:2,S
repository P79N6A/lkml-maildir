Ah, OK. I will have to check the BIOS is doing this correctly,
since I hacked it to move the MPS tables to a different place
(below 8Mb). I should really fix that using a fixmap or something
anyway ...

Pah, ACPI ;-) I don't have ACPI on these machines, but it would
be needed for a more general solution - sounds easy enough to fix 
anyway - we just keep them and mark them reserved during the Linux
ACPI parse, I think.
Thanks,
