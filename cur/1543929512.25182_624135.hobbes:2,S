The original /dev/urandom behavior was to use all the entropy that was
available, and then degrade into a pure PRNG when it was gone. The
intent is for /dev/urandom to be precisely as strong as /dev/random
when entropy is readily available.
The current behavior is to deplete the pool when there is a large
amount of entropy, but to always leave enough entropy for /dev/random
to be read. This means we never completely starve the /dev/random
side. The default amount is twice the read wakeup threshold (128
bits), settable in /proc/sys/kernel/random/.
But there's really not much point in changing this threshold. If
you're reading the /dev/random side at the same rate or more often
that entropy is appearing, you'll run out regardless of how big your
buffer is.
