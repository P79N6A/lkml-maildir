IMHO partially: base_addr etc should go from the core (to driver's
local structs if needed). I think no general netdev-setup thing is
needed, we have module parameters and library functions.
No ioctl for such things is needed either.
/sbin/ifconfig shouldn't mess with hardware data such as I/O address,
IRQ etc. - it should be a configuration tool for software protocols,
not for hardware (i.e. as /sbin/ip is).
My opinion of course.
