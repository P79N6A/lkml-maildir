If you had a clever idea about disabled access to an ebook its jail. Patents
are bad but don't trivialise the other stuff.

So mail the Red Hat legal people and ask them to land similar paperwork 
under your desk if you feel you need it (remember the GPL on 'no additional
restrictions' . Lots of people are following this kind of path - RTLinux may
have been first but lots of stuff like QV30 have followed similar "GPL ok" 
type paths. 
Like it or not patents owned and controlled by the free software community
are a neccessary thing in the short term. Yes software patents need reform,
and their addition to patent law avoiding in most of the world. Code is 
speech, imagine being able to patent a book plot, or suing George Bush
because you had a patent on pro war rhetoric ?
