Yes.
Still, the following scenario is possible while we're freezing users space
tasks:
(1) user space task calls daemonize()
(2) freezer checks if this is a user space task and the test returns 'true'
(3) task calls exit_mm() and clears its TIF_FREEZE
(4) freezer sets TIF_FREEZE for the task
(5) task calls try_to_freeze() and freezes itself (bad!)
To prevent this from happening, I think, we should acquire task_lock() around
the entire block in which the test is made and TIF_FREEZE is set for the task,
so something more sophisticated than
freezer-read-pf_borrowed_mm-in-a-nonracy-way.patch is needed.
Well, I think we should ask Andrew to drop this patch and try to address the
issue in the next series of patches.

Rafael
