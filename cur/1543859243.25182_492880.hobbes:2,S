i'd actually thought of that but, as with previous patches of mine,
it's a trade-off -- the more i try to do at once, the more chance
there is of having the patch rejected for some sort of
incompatibility.
as you may have noticed, i try to write scripts to automate a lot of
this.  this last patch definitely needed more manual work than
previous patches so i was loathe to try to push the envelope -- i
wanted to concentrate on the superfluous casts this time, and leave
other issues for future, well-defined patches.
"bit by bit," that's my motto.  well, that and "life is too short to
drink bad wine."
