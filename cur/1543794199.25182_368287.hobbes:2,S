Hi, Bartlomiej.

Thanks for pointing out, wasn't thinking about that.  Hmmm... When using 
vdma, single-sector PIO commands are issued instead but there's no 
single-sector FUA PIO command.  Would issuing 
ATA_CMD_WRITE_MULTI_FUA_EXT instead of ATA_CMD_WRITE_FUA_EXT work?  Or 
should I just disable FUA on vdma case?

Hmmm... The thing is that those failure cases will happen extremely 
rarely if at all.  Remember this post?
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111798102108338&w=3
It's mostly guaranteed that those failure cases don't occur, so I 
thought avoiding IO on failure case wasn't that helpful.

Yes, it does.  Thanks for pointing out.  One question though.  FUA 
support should be changed if using_dma/mult_count settings are changed. 
  As using_dma configuration is handled by IDE midlayer, we might need 
to add a callback there.  What do you think?
