Your do_fork() change really looks like either audit addon(but it is
really
not the case) or LSM logging facility.
I think adding cn_netlink_send() in every function in security/dummy.c
and renaming it to security/cn_logger.c or something is not such a bad
idea...
Or even wait in each function until userspace replies with the decision
to
allow or not such call.
Although it can create a lock (need to recheck security hooks in
send/recv pathes).

Now I begin to understand Chris Wright - LSM are designed not for
monitoring, 
but only for initialisation path - i.e. LSM will say only if something
is allowed or not,
but not if it was performed.
So, for exactly your setup there is no any other way then to patch
do_fork().
