Hi, I am trying to understand the integration of knfsd 1.5.1 and stock 
2.2.12 since I have a mixed FreeBSD/Linux environment and based on my
reading of LKML archive, it seems one has to apply HJ's patches to get 
some semblance of order
I got the knfsd patch and can't figure out which of the patches to
apply to 2.2.12 (Some of them don't apply cleanly). Does anybody have
a HOWTO for HJ's knfsd + stock kernel
BTW, I tried to install the 2.2.12 src rpm from Redhat's Rawhide
directory. 
rpm --recompile kernel-2.2.12-12.src.rpm s
gives me an error
line 165: Provides: tokens must begin with alpha-numeric: Provides:
kernel = 2.2.12
Thanks in advance for any assistance
Regards, Yusuf
