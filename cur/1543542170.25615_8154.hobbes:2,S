Some time ago I did some work to allow CPUs to "hold" a preempted process so
they can switch back to it without looking at the run queue when whatever
preempted them goes away.  There were certain restrictions (process must be
non-interactive SCHED_OTHER, no nested preemptions) and the timer interrupt
would release the process if it had failed to reacquire the CPU within a
tick.  The trickiest part is determining whether a process should be held.
Other enhancements to consider:
When reschedule_idle preempts a CPU it is usually unecessary for that CPU to
scan the run queue.  Often it can just switch to the preempting process in
constant time.  Particularly so if the CPU was idling.  It may even be
possible to avoid taking the runq lock in this case.
Taking running processes off the run queue.  With one CPU it makes sense to
leave executing processes on the runq, but on a busy 16p box this guarantees
a run queue length of at least 15.  And touching a task_struct tends to cause
L1 cache misses.

For one thing, on NUMAs we need to distinguish between stealing a process
from another CPU on the same node and stealing from a remote CPU.  The latter
is much more expensive.
