Hmm.  I admit I haven't read the code enough to understand really what is
going on -- I'm just guessing how it is working (and how it did work)
based on experiences I've had with it over the years.

Perhaps I should read the code to see what is actually going on (though
it is now fairly complex), but it definitely feels like this is
happening.  Why else would my keystrokes to an otherwise-idle rxvt be
delayed while my browser is rendering a page?  I suppose there may be
interactions with X.  This never used to happen, however.
The simple question: Does the scheduler ever intend to delay a context
switch to a process (which has been idle long enough to rebuild its
maximum timeslice) when a wake up event occurs?  If so, what is the
reasoning for this?

Obviously the scheduler O(1) changes and other scalability improvements
are worthwhile, but I don't think (unless I'm missing something) they
explain the problem I'm seeing.

What makes the context switches excessive?  As far as I can see, the
only thing that can initiate a context switch are a process sleeping or
finishing, a timer tick and the scheduler deciding to switch, or a device
causing a wake up event.  I was also wondering: Isn't it best to always
switch to the process which has just had an event for cache coherency?

I can do this, but I'm not seeing inefficiency, I'm seeing large decision
problems.  If the context switches were up in the hundreds of thousands
or higher, I would understand, but they're in the low hundreds.  Isn't
top far too slow to figure out what is actually going on?  Also, kernel
time is less than 10 percent, so I don't think kernel profiles will help.
Maybe I'm dreaming, but shouldn't the scheduler be simple enough so that
it can be considered "obviously correct"?  ...Or close to that? :)
