That was unfortunate, and you got dumped with those because some thought
"Ah, serial! RMK!".  Some of the categories in bugzilla still need
broadening IMO.

It's early days. The types of bugs being filed still fall into the
"useful" "not useful" categories though.  I don't think it's really
that important that we track what doesn't compile at this stage.
Those reports are being either closed within a few hours of them
being opened with a "Fixed in BK", or are drivers which no-one currently
wants to fix/can fix (Things like the various sti/cli breakage)
