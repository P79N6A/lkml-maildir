This happened a while ago to someone else too. Apparently the http 
transport needs serverside help (git-update-server-info or some such 
must be run on the remote side).
Unless you're restricted by firewalls and other you could try
git clone 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git 2.6
which works flawlessly for me although it takes quite some time to 
transfer all the data.
Linus, HPA: Are the packs cached on kernel.org? It seems to be at least 
a minute before the transfers start.
