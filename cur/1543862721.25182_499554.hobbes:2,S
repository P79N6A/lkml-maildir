I'd like to here from Andi how he feels about this?  It seems like a
somewhat drastic solution in some ways given a lot of hardware doesn't
seem to be affected (or maybe in those cases it's just really hard to
hit, I don't know).

Ideally someone from AMD needs to look into this, if some mainboards
really never see this problem, then why is that?  Is there errata that
some BIOS/mainboard vendors are dealing with that others are not?
