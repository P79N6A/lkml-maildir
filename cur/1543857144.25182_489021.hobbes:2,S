I think some of the problems with the current stack come from the fact that it 
was originally written (by Andreas Bombe) for the PCILynx chipset, in other 
words, *not* for the OHCI chipset.  The PCILynx chipset is a much lower level 
chipset, it offloads much more to software.  For example, each self ID is 
received as an individual packet, where the OHCI chipset receives these into a 
special buffer and notifies software when it has received a consistent set of 
packets.  The current stack has a callback for the host controller driver to 
call once the bus reset phase starts, a callback for each received self ID and 
a callback to indicate the end of the bus reset phase.
In the new stack, the controller/core interface is more suited for the OHCI 
controller.  The stack doens't go into a bus reset state, and all self IDs are 
reported as an atomic event.  This makes the upper layers much simpler, suits 
the OHCI controller better, and should only require a few lines extra code in 
a PCILynx driver to buffer up the self IDs.  And it's arguably better to have 
the PCILynx driver do this than have the OHCI controller split up and 
otherwise atomic event.

It's true that I'm developing for PCI+OHCI, but I've kept the controller/core 
stack split that the old stack has, nothing outside the OHCI driver depends on 
PCI (I'm using the generic DMA API).  I've shifted the abstraction level up a 
bit for the controller interface, which makes sense in general, but also since 
this is what every desktop or laptop out there has.  That said, I don't think 
anything in the stack design will break for embedded/non-OHCI chipsets.
cheers,
Kristian
