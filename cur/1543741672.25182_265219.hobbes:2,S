Not too sure what I'm looking at there.
ah.  the acpi floppy scanning code seems to be misinterpreting the
acpi_bus_register_driver() return value, so if it returns zero we think
that the driver was registered, only it wasn't.  floppy_init() then
proceeds to unregister a not-registered driver.  I think.  Does this help?

If so, I wonder why acpi_bus_register_driver() is returning zero.
Bjorn, do I remember hearing that we can drop all that code anyway?  That
it'll be done in another way?
