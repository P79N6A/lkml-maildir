Yes, it works, but one should NOT forget to rename /sbin/syslogd ->
syslogd.old and klogd likewise because the new versions install themselves
into /usr/sbin and so without renaming the old versions will be picked up.
Also, one needs to edit /etc/rc.d/init.d/syslog. This is very similar to
what one has to do if he wants to use NFSv3 client/server and latest
nfsutils on Red Hat systems (they are broken by default)
