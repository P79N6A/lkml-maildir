Hi,
Here is a patch which fixes several problems. In generic_serial this are
mostly possible null reference pointers. In sx the hang doesn't force a
close anymore so mgetty should work again. In the rio driver the modem
stuff in enabled. Also a potential problems with the old rio print
function is fixed (that the main reson for the size of the patch ;-)).
