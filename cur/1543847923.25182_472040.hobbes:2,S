You know, I'm not so sure device registration should fail when 
bus_attach_device() returns an error.
After all, the device really is there even if it's not working properly.  
In the Windows device manager it would show up with a big red X through 
it, but it _would_ show up.
Furthermore there are subtle problems that can arise.  In effect, the
device is registered for a brief time (while the driver is probed) and
then unregistered without giving the bus subsystem a chance to prepare for
the removal.  With USB this can lead to problems; if the driver called
usb_set_interface() then child devices would be created below the one
being probed -- and they would never get removed.
Has this question been raised before?  Is there any reason not to 
register a device even when probing fails?
In fact, we might want to separate driver probing from device_add()  
entirely.  That is, make them available as two separate function calls.  
That way the subsystem driver will have a chance to create attribute files
before a uevent is generated and a driver is loaded.  (That should help
udev to work better.)  This would require a larger change, though --
probably requiring an alternate version of device_add().
