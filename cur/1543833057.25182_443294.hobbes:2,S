unshare() is unsafe for some namespaces because namespaces can reference
each other. For the ipc namespace, example are shm ids vs. vma, sem ids vs.
semundos, msq vs. netlink sockets. for the user namespace, open files. So
it seems reasonable to provide a way to unshare namespaces from a clean
process context.
Now, if you try to do that from user space, you will call unshare() then
execve(), which leaves plenty of room and time for nasty things to happen
in between the 2 calls.
