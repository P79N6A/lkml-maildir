Subject: [PATCH 2.6.12.5] NPTL signal delivery deadlock fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/17/121

This bug is quite subtle and only happens in a very interesting
situation where a real-time threaded process is in the middle of a
coredump when someone whacks it with a SIGKILL. However, this deadlock
leaves the system pretty hosed and you have to reboot to recover.
Not good for real-time priority-preemption applications like our
telephony application, with 90+ real-time (SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR)
processes, many of them multi-threaded, interacting with each other for
high volume call processing.
- Bhavesh
Also, for your reading pleasure, a complete analysis of how the system
gets into a deadlock due to this bug. I wanted to post it because I
spent several hours analysing this.
