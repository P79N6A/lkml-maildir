An elite ibank in the NYC area is currently looking for an elite server side
programmer, either C++ or Java.   This person would report directly to the
head of Program Trading.  Again, this is a pure business role, not IT.
The group consists of 6 guys, all entrepreneural, mostly coming out of small
OMS shops.
An elite front-office electronic/quantitative trading group is looking for
hardcore, driven C++/Java developers. Ideally, this person will have an
entrepreneurial background, with experience developing highly-transactional,
scalable, fault tolerant trading systems.  The sales/order routing system is
currently being built from scratch.  Once this is finished, it will be a
blackbox oriented trading system.
Minimum Job Requirements:
* Minimum of 3 years relevant programming experience
* Strong proficiency in Java preferred - however, candidates with strong c++
skills will be considered.

* Fluent in networks and network protocols
* Experience with both Windows and Unix environments
* Ability to thrive in an energetic, high-paced environment
* Financial services experiences preferable
