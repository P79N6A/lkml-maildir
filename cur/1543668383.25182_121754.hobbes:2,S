Yeah ive written new drivers for 2.4, so the answer to
"have you compiled a 2.4 kernel"  would be yes.
Ive used vendor patches, but generally I chuck the defacto.
ac/mdk/redhat Compiled and prebuilt, 'cept SuSE,
not a fan of SuSE'S patches, Ive also used
via's IDE patches occasionally...
I gather the lspci, lsmod stuff and .config is to 
see if my kernels got the essential modules it needs,
it has, it boots fine, "jus' dunt do to much af'er".
Im not attempting to be rude :-)
