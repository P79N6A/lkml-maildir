No, because the existing command line parsing doesn't get to use the
slab, so there's no need for us to add that final item in your list. 
Leave it out, and you have what Tom's already implemented. The current
__setup() calls are allowed to use bootmem but not slab, and the
__early_param() calls aren't even allowed to use bootmem.
