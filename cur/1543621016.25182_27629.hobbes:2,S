That would be very broken.
The theory is: newly dirtied buffers are added at the "new"
end of the LRU.  write_some_buffers() starts at the "old"
end of the LRU.
So if write_unlock_buffers writes out the "oldest"
nr_buffers_type[BUF_DIRTY] buffers, then it knows
that it has written out everything which was dirty
at the time it was called.
Or did I miss something?
