It does not, if your module for 2.4 will care to call ->bmap(). It should
know that it gets relative IV. And that's known from the kernel version.
It can trivially convert them to absolute ones, if that's what you want.
_If_ you want the same encryption + relative ones used in format - yes, you
got a new format and need a new module.

What for? How will this new function differ from the old one? Let's just
_always_ pass the relative block number and if your module wants absolute
it can trivially get them. See the code I've sent to you.
Yes, it's an incompatibility between the 2.2 and 2.3/2.4. Trivially solvable
one. IMO it's not worth adding a new method - _that_ will give you binary
incompatibility anyway.
