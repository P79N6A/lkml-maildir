Jan, do you mean that only the one month old version could be compiled?
It it rather surprise since I know some users compiled the newer
versions. Won't you tell me how did you 'make' it? I think a personal
mail for me is pereferable to ML.
To Al Boldi,
Will you send me directly the message which is quoted by Jan? Since it
was not delivered to me.
Thanks in advance.
