You are far too optimistic.  In the best case it'll end up with higher
artificial entry barrier for contributors.  In the worst (and much more
realistic) the crap will leak all over the tree in addition to the
already present classes of bugs.
"Everyone has his pet subset/extension" is a killer for anything that isn't
done by 5-6 people, or, at least reviewed by 5-6 people who really can
read through _all_ incoming code.  For something like Linux kernel...
forget it.  It's far outside of the area where that would work.
