	Jeff,
	Let's not make a mountain of this molehill. If you want to use
old versions of Wireless Tools and wpa_supplicant with WE-21, what you
need is just to add a dummy character at the end of your ESSID. And
everything will be fine.
	Also, there is no other way to update cleanly a kernel API
than to push userspace first. I think I took way more care in term of
smoothing over the API transition than any other kernel subsystem, so
I don't know what could have been done better. I don't remember this
level of flamewar when those other subsystems did change their
userspace APIs.
	I try to be constructive about all this, so let's find a way
forward without loosing perspective.
	Regards,
	Jean
