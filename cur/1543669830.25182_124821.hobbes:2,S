Yes, there is a 3rd party vendor which has already sold a bunch of
Object Storage Targets (OSTs) to LLNL for the MCR cluster, see:

These are not the "OST-on-a-disk" paradigm that we first worked on with
Seagate, but rather large NAS/NFS storage servers that also implement
the Lustre network protocol.  We are also working with other vendors to
implement Linux-based OST targets (I'm not sure whether I can reveal names
or not) for even larger clusters.
Maybe if Lustre becomes popular enough, we will see Lustre implemented on
single disks.  There is an object-based storage group with the SCSI T10
committee, but so far their protocol is mostly unusable for Lustre.
Cheers, Andreas
