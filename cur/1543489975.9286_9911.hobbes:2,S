No, Samba does not include NetBeui support.  Samba is a _Netbios_ over
TCP/IP ipmlementation.  It will not work over IPX and it will not work
over NetBeui (if ever someone writes a driver for this) because a large
portion of the Samba would have to be rewritten for this to work. Better
to just install TCP/IP on your Windows boxes than to go through all the
work to get NetBeui working on Linux + Samba.

No. Your Windows boxes have TCP/IP support. That is what they are using to
talk to your Linux box.
