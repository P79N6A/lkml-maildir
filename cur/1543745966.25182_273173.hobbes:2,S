hi
I am needing to catch the results of the function  move_task in
kernel/sched.c , i observed it return int value and wanted print in
screen with printk.
i create a variable int results_move_task and capture the results of
move_task, and ordered print with printk("%d",results_move_task); but
i observed that returns many one rarely return two or more, really is
this right?
