It was extensively tested for more than 3 months in the -mm tree. Early on 
there were accounting bugs in the code which I corrected and we saw no 
performance regression after that across a wide range of benchmarks and 
hardware configurations at the time thanks to M Bligh. (see test.kernel.org) 
Some were done on the osdl (STP) test bench showing no regression as well but 
the osdl infrastructure became pretty much unworkable not long after.

Well I have no emotional investment in the code, I just want to do what's 
right. In the absence of measurable throughput regressions and improvement in 
smp nice handling I don't believe we should back it out.
