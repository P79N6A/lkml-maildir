I was actually referring to _this_ "comment":
/* A completion does not work here because it's counted. */
at libusual.c:181, and not yours :-)
It's a bogus comment, because the logic in there (usu_init_notify
set to 0 i.e. locked at build time, unlocked to 1 by usb_usual_init()
after usb_register() and the the dummy "down(); up();" by the
probe threads would mean that the semaphore will *never* ever
have a value other than {0, 1}. So contrary to what the author
thought, it's not a counted semaphore.
