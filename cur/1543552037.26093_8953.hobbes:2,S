It would be better if there was at least an socket option to overwrite
the sysctl. What happens when you need both behaviours on the same box 
in different applications ?  (e.g. a dynamic IP box running java and servers)
With an socket option you could at least use LD_PRELOAD for socket() or even 
fix the programs
Otherwise it'll repeat the ip_dynaddr-breaks-bind desaster, which we're
still chewing on.
