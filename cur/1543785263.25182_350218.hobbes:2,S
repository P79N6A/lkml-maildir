 Jens Axboe posted this patch for the same problem on 2 Aug:

That's not quite true, q is not invalid after this call. It will only be
invalid when it is freed (which doesn't happen from here but rather from
the blk_cleanup_queue() call when the reference count drops to 0).
This is still not perfect, but a lot better. Does it work for you?
