This is definately a great idea.  A relatively easy start should
be testing things like:
- automated crashme runs
- automated heavy stress testing
- automated compilation of the kernel with random config
  options (done by Arjan v/d Ven?)
- automated testing of certain kernel behaviour (didn't
  SGI have a project to look at this?  could they use help?)
- ... ?
Note that some of these testing options are almost trivial to
set up and could be run by any sysadmin with a few spare/test
machines. It would be great if testing like this could be done
on the Linux kernel.
If there isn't already some place to coordinate this testing,
I'll be able to host everything needed on NL.linux.org.
regards,
Rik
