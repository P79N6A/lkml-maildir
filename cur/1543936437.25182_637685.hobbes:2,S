There is nothing wrong with it; please realize that mmconf and conf1 are
just different cpu-side interfaces. Both produce precisely the *same* bus
cycles as far as the lower 256-byte space is concerned.

MMCONFIG for *some* of the devices? This doesn't sound realistic
from technical point of view.
MMCONFIG-only systems? Sure. I really hope to see these. But it won't
be PC-AT architecture anymore. It has to be something like alpha,
for instance, fully utilizing the 64-bit address space, and we'll have
to have the whole low-level PCI infrastructure completely different
for these future platforms anyway.
Right now, each and every x86 chipset *does* require working
conf1 just in order to set up the mmconf aperture. It's the very
fundamental thing, sort of design philosophy.
