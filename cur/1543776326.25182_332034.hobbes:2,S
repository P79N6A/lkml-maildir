T-states _tend_ to be utilized using chipset logic, while p4-clockmod is
done in-CPU.

In your case, I would care about throttling. In very most cases it actually
increases energy consumption, as the state being entered is technically the
same to ACPI C2 (IIRC), so it is only "forced" idling and only useful if
"forced" idling is needed to not need active cooling.
