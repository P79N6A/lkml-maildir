indent -kr -i8 -bri0 -l255 
seems to do the job even faster. I did a pile of the scsi drivers when I
went over them. The big thing is not to mix indent with real changes.
Its always a temptation but its vital that there are no outstanding
changes and that a patch exists where you can test before and after
indent to verify that change didnt cause the problems
