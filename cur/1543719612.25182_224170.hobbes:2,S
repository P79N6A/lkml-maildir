Sure, but tell me, for example, what is the point of having swap on a system
like this:
$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        516688      19900     496788          0        628      11276
-/+ buffers/cache:       7996     508692
Swap:            0          0          0
John.
