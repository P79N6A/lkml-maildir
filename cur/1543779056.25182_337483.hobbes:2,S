Subject: [PATCH 2.4]  Fix incorrect Asus k7m irq router detection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi Marcello,
Here is 2.4 version of a patch submitted earlier for 2.6 by Giancarlo
Formicuccia.
this patch:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bk-commits-head&m=111955644929114&w=2
uncovered a k7m bios bug, where the VT82C686A router is reported as
being "586-compatible". The two chips have different pirq mapping, so
this leads to "irq routing conflict" on many pci devices.
Patch for 2.4.32-pre2
