The Linux manpage says that it is not inherited across either.
However SUS says that it is not inherited across exec, and
doesn't mention fork() at all.

So...  Shouldn't we be clearing it in the exec() path?

um.  Is this correct?  It seems that we'll be clearing things
like VM_IO on device mappings across fork.  Bad.  Would an explicit
clear of VM_LOCKED be better here?  (Assuming we want to ignore SUS).
