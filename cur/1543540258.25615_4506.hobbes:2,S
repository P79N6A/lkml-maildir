It would certainly be useful for speeding up fsck, if you could teach it 
to run parallel on all spindles of the disk (e2fsck only knows how to
run parallel on multiple disks, and even that breaks with raid/lvm)
A generic interface to give user space information about on what parts
of a blockdevice they can run in parallel without too much seek overhead 
would be very nice (I believe XFS is trying to do something similar to
optimize its IO performance)
