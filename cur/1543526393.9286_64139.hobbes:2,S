Break it into manageable blocks and understand them before moving into
other areas. I would suggest starting with main.c (That's what I am doing.)
To facilitate reading this, I preprocess it and then filter it with this perl
script which is pasted below. This makes it a whole lot easier to read. Of
course, you can run menuconfig to set up <linux/autoconf.h> which defines all
the preprocessor constants in main.c. This may seem weird, but it's how I am
approaching the same problems...
This is released under public domain... It's a quick hack. You may need to
modify it. One potential drawback is gcc removes the c comments prior
to preprosessing. Some might not like that, but I would rather read the
plain bare source... Hope it helps you.
Karen.
