As somebody else pointed out, not if you don't have to compute it on
every block, as with journalling or atomic commit.

Fortunately, it's clunky and unappealing compared to the simple 
checksum method, applied only to those blocks that define consistency
points.  I don't think this is patented.  I'd be disturbed if it was,
since it's obvious.

Wouldn't that be nice.  Imagine, IBM comes out and says, we admit it,
patents are a net burden on everybody, even us - from now on, we use
them only against those who use them against us, and we'll put that
in writing.  Right.
