This problem is as old as the typewriter itself.  The trouble is that a 
Tab character doesn't have a fixed size - some set it to 3 characters 
wide, some to 4 some to 8, or whatever.
The 'indent' program was written a couple of decades ago, to pretty 
print C code.  It has a 'GNU' standard, but I'm not aware of a 'Linux' 
standard.  Anyhoo, the only way to prevent indentation wars is to use 
spaces, not tabs and to set 'diff' to ignore white space when comparing 
files...
