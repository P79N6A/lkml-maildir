Again, check is a pure BS.  Argument passed to this sucker comes from
->Instance of the same struct that had ->Handler equal to mace_interrupt().
That would be
    link->irq.Handler = &mace_interrupt;
    link->irq.Instance = dev;
in nmclan_attach().  Nothing ever modifies that beast afterwards and dev
sure as hell can't be NULL in nmclan_attach() (explict check and a bunch
of dereferencings prior to that point).
Adrian, could you please _read_ the code you are modifying?
