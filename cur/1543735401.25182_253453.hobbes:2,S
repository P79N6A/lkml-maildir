I have a problem using the DVD drive under kernel 2.6 in all the
versions I tested(up to 2.6.8.1). Since I do not use the dvd that often
it has not been a big problem but now I stating to get tired of it. 
First is there any valid way for the interrupt rate to drop below 1000 ?
This is a sample from vmstat during a copy from the dvd drive.

During use the mouse pointer sometimes get just crazy for a few seconds
it seams like X is getting fake mouse and keyboard events. resulting in
all sort of fun things ranging from the mouse pointer just moving around
to quiting some program.
The only unusual thing is that I do not have any device on hda and hdb
and a dvd writer on hdc and a dvd rom on hdd. Could this confuse the IDE
driver?
