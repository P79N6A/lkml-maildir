Many others reported similar problems.  There have been many weird USB
problems reported across the 2.6.13 cycle and I've lost the plot on which
ones remain unfixed and which ones are regressions since 2.6.12.
So I'm going to stop tracking all non-bugzilla'ed USB bug reports.  -rc6
will be out soon - if anyone still has USB problems in rc6 which aren't in
bugzilla, then please get them in there, thanks.
