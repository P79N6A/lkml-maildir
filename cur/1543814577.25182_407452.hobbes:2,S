Hmmm, may I think this is a problem of:
_TMP ,
It is neither _TMP && (_PSV || _AC0),
nor  _TMP || _PSV || _AC0.
So, please try hack thermal.c by removing calls to _TMP.
And do stress test with Vanilla Kernel, Vanilla Dsdt , just
with hacked thermal.c
Anyway, the clean way to fix your problem might be:
 suspend thermal driver with disabling AML methods invoke
that might cause/ trigger BIOS issues.
Thanks,
Luming
