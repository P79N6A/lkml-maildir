Note, LDD3 page 238 says:  "It is worth noting that most of the other
kernel primitives dealing with synchronization, such as spinlock and
atomic_t operations, also function as memory barriers."
I don't know about Linux 2.6.10 against which LDD3 was written, but
currently only _some_ atomic_t operations function as memory barriers.
Besides, judging from some posts in this thread, saying that atomic_t
operations dealt with synchronization may not be entirely precise.
