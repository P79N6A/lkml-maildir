The patchset has looked good to me, and I believe it would be better to 
take this particular breakage sooner rather than later.
I haven't spoken up actively mostly because I wanted to look at the user 
comments as they have been coming in.
The issue with "make allyesconfig" concerns me, although the same 
situation already exists with any multiple-choice configuration.  What I 
guess we really want is to be able to specify a few specific choices.
