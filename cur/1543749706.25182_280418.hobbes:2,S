Hi,
I've been looking over the smbfs kernel code with someone at work and
he thinks there might be a bug.
In fs/smbfs/proc.c function smb_build_path (I won't give exact line
numbers 'cause I'm looking at 2.5.6), the first call of the form:
len = server->ops->convert(path, maxlen-2, 
				      entry->d_name.name, entry->d_name.len,
				      server->local_nls, server->remote_nls);
We think that maxlen-2 should be
maxlen - (2 << unicode)
Does anyone agree?
Thanks,
Julian
