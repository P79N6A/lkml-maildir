	You are right, we are know sure another machine was 
	involved, the third one is also a Linux one (2.0.36).
	Gated is running on that one and doing "RIP" on its interface.
	Once we stop doing RIP on the local network interface, no reset 
	Packet anymore.
	"Defective" systems were not listening on RIP, I was
	not even able to trace ICMP redirect packet, I do not catch 
	why the system with gated was sending Reset packet at random,
	it should not be not concerned at all with this local traffic......
	Many thanks for you help
