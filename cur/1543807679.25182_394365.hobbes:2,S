Well, there are far more people that use what distrubutions provide 
than anything else. And distributions tend to like applying some 
patches to the vanilla kernel, but if at all possible, not to be too 
far away from mainline. Which is a good policy, of course, as it 
reduces the amount of work for them and makes them submit improvements 
upstream.
So, when distributors are able to get their hands on something that 
Just Works in the mainline, they will make sure things are nicely 
integrated, variety of configs are supported (like suspending to swap 
partitions, swap files or regular files), that the whole thing looks 
pretty and performs well. All of this can be done with Suspend2 today.
So, it isn't just about the basics any more (i.e. who can suspend and 
who cannot). Majority of users prefer things that work better, are 
faster and look prettier.
