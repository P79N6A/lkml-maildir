Can you try 2.6.20-rc3 and see if 'CLO not available' message goes away
(please post boot dmesg)?
The crash/lock is because filesystem code does not cope with IO errors
very well.  I can't tell why timeouts are occurring in the first place.
 It seems that only samsung drives are affected (sda2, 3, 4).  Hmmm...
Please apply the attached patch to 2.6.20-rc3 and test it.
Thanks.
