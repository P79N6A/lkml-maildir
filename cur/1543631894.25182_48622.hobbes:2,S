I might have worked for ide2 and 3 but it didnt work for ide4 and 5.
But hdparm -X69 /dev works just fine, just bad that it isnt at boot up but
I will set it as soon as possible.
-X69 is UDMA 5 mode, funny thing is i can set it to UDMA 6 =) but there is
no speed change, just funny that the ide card takes that setting.
Thanks for all your help, this solution will cover my needs for the
moment.
