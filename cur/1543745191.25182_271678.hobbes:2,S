If I look at /proc/meminfo, I see each number prefixed with a short
identifying name. Looking at /proc/*/stat, however, I have to count
fields to get to the field I want. I realise that it's probably not
possible to change the format of this file (since it's read by
ps(1), among others), but I wonder if you have any tools that parse
it, similar to /proc/meminfo -- i.e. primarily for debugging?
If not, I have a shell script that works well and which I would then
publicise. I just don't want to push yet another software doing
The Same Thing out there...
