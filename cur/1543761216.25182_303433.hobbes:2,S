Any version.  It has been like this for years with all versions of xfree 
from debian testing,
so I have simply given up using 3D on this particular machine.  I also tried
downloading and compiling x.org 6.8.1 to have a look at transparency
and shadows.  Transparency worked - dri crashed as usual.  At the moment,
I use the debian package xserver-xfree86-dri-trunk which contains the
x.org server (not the xfree one).  My current kernel is 2.6.11-mm3.

Thanks, I'll try that.

Stable as rock, _if_  Load "dri" is commented out from xorg.conf (or 
from XF86Config-4)

No usb.  The mouse is connected to the ps/2 mouse port.  As I mentioned, 
this is
not a recent problem.  I could never load dri on this machine without
such a crash.  I can check whether the IRQ gets shared though.
