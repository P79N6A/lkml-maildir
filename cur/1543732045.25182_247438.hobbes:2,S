It does no harm trying. It does real harm not being conservative and
losing peoples data. You recover people's data after its lost, the
IDE layer's job is to make sure it doesn't get lost in the first place.

Right now I know of no way to tell which is readahead for a failed
command or of telling the block layer to forget them. Fix this at the
block layer and IDE can abort the readahead sequence happily enough
because IDE is too dumb to have issued further commands to the drive at
this point.
