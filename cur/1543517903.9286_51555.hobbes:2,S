And one more thing to do: you have to boot the system with some 64bit kernel
(either from network or CD, maybe floppy) with root=/dev/yourrootdisk and
rerun silo:
/sbin/silo -f
If you'd run this on some 32bit box, then you will need to pass -u argument
as well (and accept that next boot from disk will fail unless it will be on
64bit machine).
Cheers,
