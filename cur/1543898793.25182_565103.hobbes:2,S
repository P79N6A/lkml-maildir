It does not sound stupid and sounds good at first sight.
But there are problems we've already seen with similar situations in 
different parts of the kernel:
They would have different hardware support, features and bugs.
And then a user user whose sound card is only supported by sound system A
needs a feature only available in sound system B.
And the quality decreases since people will often not report bugs in 
sound system A if sound system B works for them.
OTOH, for a user it shouldn't matter whether there's OSS or ALSA, that's 
mostly a difference for application developers. And since (as you say) 
most applications already support both, there's no compelling reason for 
providing more than one of them.
