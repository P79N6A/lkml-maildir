Agreed.  It may well be less than one watt of power saving.

I strongly disagree - we don't know that it fails on more than a few configurations at the moment.  If you mark everything as (DANGEROUS), then you might as well not mark any of it (DANGEROUS), and delete the whole package.
We need to establish what causes the -Y problem, and then ask Mark to put a note saying something like, 'Do not use on kernels < 2.4.X'
When I said the person to ask would be Mark, I *didn't* mean that I thought it *should* be marked (DANGEROUS), only that we should be investigating it!!!

There is no reason why it should fail on a mounted drive.
