The only major user of i_shared is really vmtruncate, I think, and it's
quite ok to unmap the file before removing the mapping from the shared
list - if vmtruncate finds a unmapped area, it just won't be doing
anything (zap_page_range, but that won't do anything without any page
tables).
Together with the fact that unmap() already does it this way anyway, it
looks like the obvious fix..
