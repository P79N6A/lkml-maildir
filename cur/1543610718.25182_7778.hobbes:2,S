Due to a small misscommunication between myself and Greg, he sent you
all a patch to change the USB maintainer contact information to himself.
I had intended to send you the patch myself along with a brief
explanation.
Anyway, with my job change a couple of months ago and some other changes
in my life, I haven't been able to put the work people expect out of the
USB maintainer.
Greg has graciously stepped up to fill in for me for a bit but I don't
see things getting any better for me, while Greg has been given more
time to put into the USB project.
It just makes so much sense that Greg take over the maintainer position
since he has the time and know how.
I won't stop development for Linux or USB and will continue to maintain
some of the drivers I have maintained in the past, but Greg will handle
all of the patches and more importantly, head up the direction for the
Linux USB code.
Thanks for the help and I wish Greg luck!
