Ok, this definitely looks a lot cleaner.
We'll end up reading and parsing the config file multiple times, something
I wonder a bit about, but my gut feel is that this is the "right"

You seem to be exporting a but too much (CORE_FILES etc things that are
really only internal to the main Makefile), but it looks fine. 
Anybody who dislikes this approach?
