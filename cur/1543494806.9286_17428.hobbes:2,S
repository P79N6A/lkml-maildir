   If so, I am trying to understand why this nifty feature is not used
   in many drivers within 2.2.6.  Is this just because the author has
   not yet taken advantage of this option, or because there are subtle
   reasons why it cannot be used in some circumstances?  If the
   latter, I'd like to better understand those reasons. :-)
In several cases it is because nobody got around to it yet.
In some others, we put it in, but then discovered that the routine in
question does sometimes need to be invoked after the kernel is done
booting, so using an initfunc was not valid in those cases.
