Subject: missing RealTek 8129/8139 (not 8019/8029!) support

Sirs:
"RealTek 8129/8139 (not 8019/8029!) support"
seems to be missing from 'make menuconfig' in linux-2.2.19.tar.bz2.
And CONFIG_RTL8139 was not in the .config file.  However, when I
added CONFIG_RTL8139=m by hand to .config the module was built.
I checked on an earlier kernel and the RealTek support option
appears right before the "Other ISA cards" option.
