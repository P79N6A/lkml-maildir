Right, having devfs present and NOT THE DEFAULT is a compromise.
I would prefer to see devfs in the kernel as the primary
method for device management. Anything less than that is
giving ground. It exists, it works, it is nicer than the
other proposed solutions (IMO), and it is not mandatory.
It would seem that the only reason to keep it out of the
kernel would be to keep it from becoming standard.
