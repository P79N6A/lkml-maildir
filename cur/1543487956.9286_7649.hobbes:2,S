Hi Tigran,
  Had a quick look at this.
  A _possible_ reason for the problem is;
	  i) Page-fault to grow the stack (say the call to fprintf()
	     generates this)
	 ii) Size of stack has reached hard-limit, so calls
	     force_signal(SIGSEGV, tsk)
	iii) Returning from the page-fault handler causes the signal
	     to be delivered.
	 iv) do_signal() sees a handler is installed and calls
	     handle_signal(), which calls setup_frame().
	  v) setup_frame() calls get_sigframe() to find the address to
	     build the frame at (the normal user-stack if altsigstack
	     isn't being used).
	 vi) access_ok() returns true as you're not running on an old
	     i386, so only the address limit is checked.
	     This doesn't seem to be a strong enough check.  It is
	     possible there is not enough distance between the top
	     of stack and the hard stack size limit (ulimit) for a
	     full frame.
 	vii) If there isn't enough space, building up the stack frame
	     causes a page-fault, which cannot grow the stack (as the
	     limit has been reached).
Am I correct in my understanding at step vi)?
If so the fix would be another, stronger check in setup_frame() and
setup_rt_frame().  If there isn't enough distance, the handler should be
removed before delivering the signal (SIGSEGV - ie. drop core).
