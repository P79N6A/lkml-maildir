Hi, guys!
I got this message in the logs:
kernel: ip_input(): demasq recursion detected. Check masq modules configuration
What is this?
It means that I have to increment the space for the masquaraded ports or
decrement the masquarade time? I have ~100 clients behind the Linux.
What you think?
Thanks in advance!
