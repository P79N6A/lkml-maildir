Consider XFS flushed out (once I merge). This, for us, is the tricky part:

XFS introduces the concept of the low level flush of a buffer not always
being really a low level flush, since a delayed allocate buffer can end
up reentering the filesystem in order to create the true on disk allocation.
This in turn can cause a transaction and more memory allocations. The really
nasty case we were using GFP_BUFFER for is a memory allocation which is from
within a transaction, we cannot afford to have another transaction start out
of the bottom of memory allocation as it may require resources locked by
the transaction which is allocating memory.
