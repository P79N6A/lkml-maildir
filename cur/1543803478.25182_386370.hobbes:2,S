Subject: 2.6: xfs is rebuilt on every .config change

This happened for a long time, actually in late 2.5.x (that I have started 
with). Every time I make some changes to config - or simply do make oldconfig 
- - xfs is rebuilt. This happens when there are *no* changes related to xfs 
alltogether. E.g. I now applied 2.6.15.1 patch and xfs got rebuilt again.
It may be nitpicking, but it is huge module, I have relatively slow system ans 
sometimes want to quickly test some trvial changes. xfs doubles compile time 
(at the very least).
