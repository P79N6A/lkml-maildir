It depends how much swap gets used in your normal activity. A good rule
of thumb is to make sure you have as much swap as RAM, plus a little
more for any genuine swapping the system is doing. Then you'll be able
to save a full image without freeing up any memory... and when you do
resume, your system will be as responsive as it would be if you'd never
suspended.

If there's not swap space to store the image in, suspend tries to free
memory until there is. In the worst case, it will reach a point where it
can't free any more memory, give up and cleanly back out. (Or that's the
plan, another email I just received means I will shortly double check
this is happening correctly under 2.6).

Haha! See what I can do.
