You can safely tell udev to ignore dm devices, if you use LVM or EVMS. 
It almost always creates them under the wrong directory and with wrong 
name anyway. Correcting this means just duplicating LVM/EVMS 
configuration in udev rules. Better leave this task of dm node creation 
to dmsetup and related tools.
