I have a K6-III which announces MCE but not MCA, so I was going to
test this on that machine.
However, both the K6-III manual and the K6 BIOS guide state quite
clearly that the K6 family only has a "stub" MCE implementation.
The MCE capability is announced, there are two MCE-related MSRs,
and there is a CR4.MCE flag, but none of it actually _does_ anything.
The new CPU detection code should probably clear FEATURE_MCE for K6 CPUs.
(We might consider it an AMD bug, but in their defense, they do state
that the stub implementation was done for "compatibility" reasons.)
