right.  the perror() giving nonsensical results wasn't the cause of my
problem of course, i was just trying to use it to find out why the pipe
didn't seem to work.  turns out that i missed the forest for the trees;
the pipe was being opened for writing from the wrong end...
(as a side note, the code in question was written on a solaris box, and
it seems to Just Work in the wrong direction there, go fig.)
