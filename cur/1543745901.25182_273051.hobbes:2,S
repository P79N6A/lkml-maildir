Yes, generally backward compatibility is a good thing and I shall try
to follow it as far as I can.
However, FUSE is still young (only 3 years old), and I can imagine,
that there will come a time, (not too often) when it's better to break
the API than to carry a lot of compatibility cruft around.  And in
that case the version is very useful.
Also it's useful to distingush the integrated version from the older
standalone versions.
Thanks,
Miklos
