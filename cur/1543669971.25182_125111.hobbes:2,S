 Hello Linux ppl,
 I have copuple of questions, I request you to share the information if you
know ....

 In the readprofile man page load=(# of clk ticks) / (length of the procedure)
 
 What does "length of procedure" means. Does that mean the # of ASM lines of
 the procedure code? What is the units of the load. It cannot be %. because 
-----------------------------------------------------------
 152495 default_idle                             3176.9792 
-----------------------------------------------------------
 the above line indicates,  more than 100% of times CPU is idle. This cannot
happen.

 What value of the procedure load is considered to be a potential CPU
intensive procedure/ high load procedure.
Say for example, if the load value is 20, then is that procedure considered to
be a high load procedure. 
Thanking You
Shesha
