I was asking 32G, that's half of that and it leaves 500M free. 64G is a
no-way with 3:1.

the vm is able to reclaim them before running oom, though it has a
performance cost.

pmds seems 13M for 10000 tasks, but maybe I did the math wrong.

4k stacks then need to allocate the task struct in the heap, though it
still saves ram, but it's not very different.

this overhead doesn't exist in 2.4.

this is one of the main issues of 2.4.

yes, an 8-way with 32G it's unlikely that can scale up to 10000 tasks,
regardless, but maybe things change with a 32-way 32G.
The main thing you didn't mention is the overhead in the per-cpu data
structures, that alone generates an overhead of several dozen mbytes
only in the page allocator, without accounting the slab caches,
pagetable caches etc.. putting an high limit to the per-cpu caches
should make a 32-way 32G work fine with 3:1 too though. 8-way is
fine with 32G currently.
other relevant things are the fs stuff like file handles per task and
other pinned slab things.

for these workloads (the 10000 tasks are the workloads we know very
well) dcache/icache doesn't matter, and still I find 3:1 a more generic
kernel than 4:4 for random workloads too. And if you don't run the 10000
tasks workload then you've the normal-zone free to use for dcache
anyways.

I think pte-highmem is definitely needed on 4:4 too, even if you use
hugetlbfs that won't cover PAE and the granular window which is quite a
lot of the ram.
Overall shared pageteables doesn't payoff for its complexity, rather
than sharing the pagetables it's better not to allocate them in the
first place ;) (hugetlbfs/largepages).
The pratical limit of the hardware was 5k tasks, not a kernel issue.
Your 10k example has never been tested, but obviously at some point a
limit will trigger (eventually the get_pid will stop finding a free pid
too ;)
