Hi,
Thanks for looking into this.

I haven't word wrapped it at all.  The lines appear as whole lines in  
Apple Mail (my email client).  It must be your email client that is  
wrapping them...

Ok, Marc, would you be able to do the copy to /dev/null again (booted  
without the ram=2G option) and when you see that most of the memory  
has gone run:
cat /proc/slabinfo > slabinfo.txt
cat /proc/meminfo > meminfo.txt
cat /proc/vmstat > vmstat.txt
cat /proc/zoneinfo > zoneinfo.txt
Then quickly abort the copy with "Ctrl+C" so hopefully you will not  
get a kernel panic...
Please send the content of the generated files.  Thanks.
That should hopefully show what in the kernel has eaten all the low  
memory...
Best regards,
	Anton
