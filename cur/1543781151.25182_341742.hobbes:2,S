I compiled a vanilla 2.6.12.4 kernel, enabled EARLY_PRINTK and
rebooted with earlyprintk=vga. The kernel didn't display any extra
information before the delay.
$ uname -a
Linux quince 2.6.12.4 #1 Fri Aug 12 13:02:40 PDT 2005 i686 GNU/Linux
$ cat /proc/cmdline
root=/dev/md0 ro nodma earlyprintk=vga
$ grep EARLY_PRINTK /boot/config-2.6.12.4
CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK=y
I tried Alt-SysRq-T but there was no response. SYSRQ is enabled.
$ grep SYSRQ /boot/config-2.6.12.4
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y
Cheers,
Shaun
