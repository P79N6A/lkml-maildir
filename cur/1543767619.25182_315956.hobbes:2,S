Are those (mostly) modular?
Is this supposed to be a kernel that is used on a regular basis,
not just a temporary quick boot thing?
You want one kernel that handles many configurations but fits
in < 510 KB?  That is aggressive.  :)
I think of this as being a custom kernel, but it sounds
like you want a very general-purpose (small) one.
| Hmm, I did find one I forgot.  CONFIG_MII.

| EXPERIMENTAL=y
| CLEAN_COMPILE=y
| BROKEN_ON_SMP=y
Do you need some drivers etc. that are EXPERIMENTAL or BROKEN?
Just curious.
| ACPI=y
| ACPI_BOOT=y
| ACPI_INTERPRETER=y
| ACPI_BUS=y
| ACPI_EC=y
| ACPI_POWER=y
| ACPI_PCI=y
| ACPI_SYSTEM=y
so some systems may need ACPI ?
| ISA=y
| CARDBUS=y
| PCMCIA_PROBE=y
some systems have ISA?  some are PCMCIA/CardBus?
| PNP=y
| ISAPNP=y
and ISA PNP?  :(
| SCSI_PROC_FS=y
drop this one
| AIC7XXX_DEBUG_ENABLE=y
| AIC7XXX_REG_PRETTY_PRINT=y
| AIC79XX_DEBUG_ENABLE=y
| AIC79XX_REG_PRETTY_PRINT=y
drop these.
| SOUND_GAMEPORT=y
drop.
| VT=y
| VT_CONSOLE=y
| HW_CONSOLE=y
| VGA_CONSOLE=y
| DUMMY_CONSOLE=y
drop that ^^^^^

drop NTFS (you didn't list it as a requirement :)

| NFS_V3=y
| LOCKD_V4=y
| MSDOS_PARTITION=y

drop ^^^^^
so what's the problem with using a bzImage kernel?
