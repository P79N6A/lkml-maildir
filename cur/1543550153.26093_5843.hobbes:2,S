I think one needs to be careful of not letting a desire for the perfect
solution prevent deploying a useful solution while working out the best one,
in this case.
When a multithreaded application "dies" due to one of the threads failing in
an unexpected and unrecoverable way, there probably isn't, at that point, a
"same state" for the threads to be in, and an non-coherent dump, while still
difficult to use, is more useful than not dumping any state at all, and
often is coherent enough to use anyway.
