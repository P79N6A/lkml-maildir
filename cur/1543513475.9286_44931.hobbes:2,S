good Q. My guess is that people want more than just what is
reported to work with Linux they want actual experiences. 
Example: which cd burners work best under Linux or which network
cards work best. Sure NE 2000 network cards are reported to
work, but there are some NE clones that don't work as well as
others, and this may not be discussed in detail in doc you refer
to, but somoene on the list may have had experience with getting
a card to work.  
Another example would be which MB should one buy If I want ot
set up a Quad processor system, or Dual processor system. Last
time I read the hardware howto (its been a while) it said my MB
was a good MB for SMP and Linux. However that was also with 2.0
kernels.
