Not a huge problem, since I don't think klibc itself is a stability issue. 
However, as you say:

Yes. But that's not an argument that flies with me. I really want to see 
people actually using it, for real issues (even if they are potentially 
_small_ real issues).
I feel that people who want to work on early stuff can easily merge it 
themselves (especially if they use BK), and show it to be useful. I don't 
have the slightest feeling that work can't be done unless _I_ merge it.
