    Hi all :))
    I'm not sure whether this issue belongs to the kernel or to the
libc, but I think that is more on the kernel side, that's why I ask
here.
    Let's go to the matter: I want to change the argv[0] a program
shows, in order to be pretty-printed when issuing 'ps', 'top' or
other commands. What I'm doing now is just writing over the existing
argv[0] string, but then I must use a *shorter-or-equal* string in
order to fit it on the existing space. What if I need to put a
*larger* string on argv[0]? Is this possible at all?
    Thanks in advance :)
