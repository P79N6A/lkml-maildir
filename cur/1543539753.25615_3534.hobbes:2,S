Well, wrong as phrased, but right as intended. Yeah, you are working
for yourself, as a hobby.
You *also* have a responsibility to all of the people out there who
trust the kernel developers to do what's right. If you don't want that
responsibility, don't hack on the kernel. They trust you, all of you

to be worthy of that trust.
