With the new stable series kernels, the .x versioning is being added to
EXTRAVERSION.  This has traditionally been a space for local modification.
I know several distributions are using EXTRAVERSION for build numbers,
platform and assorted other information to differentiate their kernel
releases.
I would propose that the new stable series kernels move the .x version
information somewhere more official.  I certainly do not mind throwing
together a patch to support DOTVERSION or what ever people want to call it.
Is anyone opposed to such a change?
Thanks,
Justin M. Forbes
