Ottawa Linux Symposium comes closest, together with Linux Conf Australia.
OLD publishes proceedings where people present their ideas, sometimes
already implemented, sometimes planned.
Otherwise, people have been known to present their ideas to this list. An
example is the epoll work which was presented on this page

A lot of it is informal. I know some linux kernel developers are pretty
close with hardware manufacturers and especially AMD invested a lot of time
and effort in making sure the Opteron design was fit for linux, which mostly
worked.
Linus mentioned a few years ago that a lot of these exchanges occurred in
hallways of conferences, suddenly some people would jump him and say "we're
from [ big company ] and we'd like linux to do this" or "we're from [ big
company ] and we're wondering how we should design our hardware". Linus then
called for opening up this process, which has happened for a bit. OSDL may
also be a venue.

Rest assured that this list has subscribers @ all relevant processor
manufacturers. But there is nothing formal, it is not the linux way to set
up committees or whatever, except perhaps for OSDL.
