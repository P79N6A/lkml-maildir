Any notes on how you maintain repository-level information?
For example, the expense in BK wasn't the single-file history, it was the
_repository_ history, ie the "ChangeSet" file. Which grows quite slowly,
but because it _always_ grows, it ends up being quite big and expensive to
parse after three years.
Ie do you have the git kind of "independent trees/commits", or do you 
create a revision history of those too?
