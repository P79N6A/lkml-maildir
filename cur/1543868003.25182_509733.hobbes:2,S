Yeah, so if I understand correctly, markers are basically compile time locations
that you can attach function calls to at run time, right?. If so, I
don't think they are of much use to me.
What I am doing is page-faulting on every read or write to an mmio
region, decoding the faulting instruction and passing the decoded
information up to userspace through relayfs.
