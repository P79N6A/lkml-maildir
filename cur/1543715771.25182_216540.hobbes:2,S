I agree with Rusty Russell. Anything that we do can be circunvented.
If they are really into it, they can build a small tool to change the symbol 
information from the module.
The way I see it, they know a C string ends with a '\0'. This is like saying 
that a English sentence ends with a dot. If they wrote "GPL\0" they are 
effectively saying that the license *is* GPL period.
So, where the source code? :)
