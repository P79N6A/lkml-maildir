Ok, that took a bit longer than I hoped, but the result is now
finally available at:
http://gollum.phnxsoft.com/~ts/linux/dmesg-acpidebug.out
Note that I doctored this a bit: the dmesg buffer had already
overflowed by the time I ran the dmesg command, so I manually
prepended the missing part from the file /var/log/boot.msg into
which SUSE saves the early kernel messages. The border between
the two is marked off by the string "~~~~~~~~splice~~~~~~~~",
and I left a line of overlap to make it very clear.
The output of acpidump is unchanged wrt what I already posted.
(Unsurprisingly, but nevertheless I checked. Call me paranoid. ;-)
