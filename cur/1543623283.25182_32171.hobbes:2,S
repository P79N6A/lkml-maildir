My impression is that most modern JFS can work on multiple transactions 
simultaneously.  All you really care about, I believe, is I/O ordering within 
the transaction.  However, separate transactions have no I/O ordering 
requirements with respect to each other (unless they actually overlap).  Using 
ordered tags imposes a global ordering, not just a local transaction ordering, 
so they may not be the most appropriate way to ensure the ordering of writes 
within a single transaction.
I'm not really a JFS expert, so perhaps those who actually develop these 
filesystems could comment?
