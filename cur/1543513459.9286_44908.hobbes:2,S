Usually, I think you are right, but not on this one. _Detection_ of
duplicates is _very_ important, and "let's have another daemon" just doesn't
cut it, as most users will not install such a daemon, and DAD is just to
important. (Imagine you need access to the network to install this daemon,
but you can't because the network is broken).
It were different though, if there was 1 (and only 1) "Network-daemon" that
did all things that the kernel-network-guys wanted to do in userspace :-)
