Hi Jeff,
I'm having a play with UML (on Debian testing, gcc 2.95.4, x86 box) and the 
um kernel fails to build. Same on Debian unstable with gcc-3.3. Looks like 
either a missing include or changed struct. (or both) My experience extends 
about as far as trying to include <asm/cache.h> (which defines 
CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT) in "include/linux/sched.h" but that didn't work, 
oh well :-)
Hopefully a more or less useful bugreport.
- Peter.
