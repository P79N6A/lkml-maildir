A "small stuff" maintainer may indeed be a good idea. The maintainer could
be the same as somebody who does bigger stuff too, but they should be
clearly different things - trivial one-liners that do not add anything
new, only fix obvious stuff (to the point where nobody even needs to think
about it - if I'd start getting any even halfway questionable patches from
the "small stuff" maintainer, it wouldn't work).
