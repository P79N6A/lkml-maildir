ok, running with 2.5.69-bk8 since 11.5h. I'v just enabled agpmode = 2 in
XF86Config-4, everythink is on standard value. The system is stable till
now.
I've changed the settings around 2.5.69 because i've tried to get the
linux neverwinter nights client running smoother and have forgotten to
remove it from the config file. I must have been lucky until 2.5.69-bk5
which started to crash my system (so there isn't a regression, just a
"normal" instability (of which i have been warned...).
