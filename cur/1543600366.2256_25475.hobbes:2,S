What's the use of an inactive_clean list anyway, or the effective difference
between its members and the members of memfree (I suspect such a list from the
output of /proc/meminfo)?
Besides the fact, that the splitting in two lists prevents proper
defragmentation (if you have pages in two lists you are not driven to defrag at
the point where you put them together in one).
