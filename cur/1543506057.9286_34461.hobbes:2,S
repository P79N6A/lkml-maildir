Subject: Disabling module loading with a module?

Recently there has been some discussion on BSDs securelevels (or whatever they're
called. I'm just a beginner :*-( ), (Especially after the (alleged) hack of
the (alledged) internet auditing project) , and the posibility of disabling
the loading of modules without going down to single-user mode first.
Would it be possible to make a module for the linux kernel that mimics this, by
disabling the loading of modules? Could a module trap the necessary system
calls for inserting a module, and disable them? That way It could act as a sort
seal that is loaded after all modules are loaded at startup.
