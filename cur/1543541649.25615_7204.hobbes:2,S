Compile a current standard linus kernel without reiserfs and repeat the
experiment (its dying before the fs is loaded so you shouldnt have a problem
here)

You have an I2O controller that thinks it has 128Mb of memory mapping. That
is pretty high end -but then the board sounds that way.

And it bombs out inside of the code trying to remap the I/O space. This appears
to be a bug in the remapping code. The i2o code seems to have made a 
correct request for 128Mb and the x86 mm layer blew up.
