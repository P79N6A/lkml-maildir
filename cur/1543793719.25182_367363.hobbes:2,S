I'll take a look at what's involved in doing this. Using a compile time
option, I was depending on the compiler to see that
for (i = 0; i < RCLM_TYPES; i++) {}
would only every iterate once and get rid of the loop. If I think there is
any chance of these patches getting merged, I'll work on making this a
sysctl or boot-time option rather than a compile option.

Agreed, but I felt that some mechanism for disabling this for small
systems was desirable. As it is right now, I see this as a
very-small-memory-available option.

Can't argue with you there. However, for the purposes of discussion here,
it shows exactly where anti-defrag affects the current allocator.
