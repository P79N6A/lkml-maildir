No, that's fine.

Yeh; I wasn't going to change anything else about it;   the
rate limiting (that I think Neil put in a few months ago) means
that any one client doesn't get too noisy - I've got something
trying to do version 0 on nfs to a bunch of boxes and I do wonder
why; I suspect it's just a monitoring script - but it seems better
to know about it until I figure it out.
I'm not going to be able to recut the patch until the weekend;
do you just want to remove the 'err' in your copy and feed this
to the main tree with some of the rest of your patches?
Dave
