In which case, I have to say...
Congratulations!  You've found a bug with Red Hat's Enterprise Linux
kernel!  Go straight to Red Hat's bugzilla!  Do not collect 200$.  Do
not pass go.
Seriously though, this bug is not present in mainline kernels, so I
can't resolve this issue for you.  Mainline kernels appear to work
properly.
