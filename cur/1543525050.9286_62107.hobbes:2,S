Hi guys,
Eons ago I observed that a task can never be put to TASK_SWAPPING state
under Linux and produced this patch:
   
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/tswap-2.3.35.patch
which Linus did not accept. Therefore, instead of assertion - I ask a
question - why is TASK_SWAPPING still needed?
I will redo the patch for the latest kernel and re-send to Linus if
everyone agrees that TASK_SWAPPING is indeed obsolete.
Regards,
