Why is this the default behavior?  It seems like you would want all IRQ
threads to be SCHED_FIFO by default.   Otherwise it seems like the
scheduler could decide to run a normal userspace process (like, say, X)
while an IRQ thread is runnable.
Is it really a good idea for IRQ threads to be subject to the whims of
the scheduler?
Also, on modern machines, this would effectively make all IRQ threads
SCHED_OTHER because the USB port shares an interrupt with everything:
