These ideas based on my experience in a production server environment, in
web hosting:
Temperature (Red/Yellow/Green LED)
CPU load (Red/Yellow/Green LED)
Out of Memory (blinking red?)
Don't imagine it would be hard to make a red LED status also set off an
alarm via the PC speaker. Although really a proper system will alert you of
these things anyway, but it would be nice to see it at a glance too.
