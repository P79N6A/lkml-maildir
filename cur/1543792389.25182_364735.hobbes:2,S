If we're going to export ptrace_get_task_struct() to the world it would be
nice to document it too - things like returning zero and a NULL *childp is
a little obscure.
The change breaks ALLOW_INIT_TRACING in sparc32 and sparc64.  I don't know
if that matters.  If (presumably) not, there are cleanups left over.
In arch/ia64/ia32/sys_ia32.c this patch will cause PTRACE_TRACEME requests
to be handled by ptrace_request() rather than by sys_ptrace(), which is a
not-obviously-correct change.
Was the omission of arch/ia64/kernel/ptrace.c:sys_ptrace() deliberate?
