Subject: Odd code in iput() (since 2.1.60). What for?

	Folks, could somebody recall why the check for I_DIRTY had been
added to iput()? AFAICS it does nothing. If the inode is hashed and clean
it's already on inode_in_use, otherwise we are in *big* trouble (the only
reason for that might be crazy ->delete_inode() doing insert_inode_hash().
Was it a preparation for undelete or what?) I have to tweak inode.c for
FAT fixes and I'm not too happy about the perspective of tweaking code if 
I don't understand its parts ;-/ Especially in such place.
	Code in question had been added in 2.1.60 and I couldn't find any
discussion in archives ;-/ Could somebody help with it?
							Cheers,
								Al
