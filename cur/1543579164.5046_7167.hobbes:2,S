  2.4.0 with devfs mounted at boot time into /dev/
  Only thing missing is that here  /dev/scsi/host0/  propably should be
  a symlink to something like   /dev/bus/pci/BB/II.F ...
  Or perhaps  /dev/scsi/BUS/BB/II.F/busN/targetT/lunL/partP
  but mixing in ISA-bus controllers is somewhat tough..
$ mount
/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part3 on / type ext2 (rw)
/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target2/lun0/part2 on /home type ext2 (rw)
/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part4 on /usr type ext2 (rw)
/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target2/lun0/part1 on /usr/src type ext2 (rw)
/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1 on /boot type ext2 (rw)
  I do, of course, use mounting with  LABEL=
  This new style (which contains, hopefully, physical PCI location)
  mount device paths will failry easily handle question about which
  is where...   And the partitions are PHYSICAL partition numbers,
  not some logical ones.  That is true with /dev/sdXP case as well
  as with /dev/hdXP case.
