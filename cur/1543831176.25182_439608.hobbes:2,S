it's 256 context switches... if you care about context switch cycles
you'll do many, and 256 isn't a lot ;)
(remember that this is after 5 *consecutive* fpu uses, not just 5 uses
total, to you're really a heavy fpu user if you hit that)

s/instructions/cycles/
well there are 4 segment loads, a few msr accesses, a few PDA writes and
optionally even the fxsave of the old task inbetween the prefetch and
the use of the memory; those do add up *bigtime*...
