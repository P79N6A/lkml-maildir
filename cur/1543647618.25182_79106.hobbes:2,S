Hmmm, so why wouldn't the journal be flushing more regularly (the 5 seconds
it's claiming in desg), or is that something we should ask on the ext3 list?
Apart from remounting the filesystem, is there any easy way to test this
(again, silly mounted as /, so I think it's a reboot every time to try a new
mounting configuration?)
Thanks
Rob
