:I can also report that on my 4k block systems, I never see directories
:smaller than 4k in size, but that's (A) expected, and (B) desired.

:I can understand the viewpoint that says the "size" of a directory is
:simply a count of the number of valid entries therein, but I don't
:agree with it.
 and why not? it seems meaningless to see a directory size reported as
1024 while the actual size may be far below. only the filesystem
algorithms can make sense out of it. why, then it would make sense to see
all regular files with sizes multiples of blocksize. can you please
explain why you desire it that way.
