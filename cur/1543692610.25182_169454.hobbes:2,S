It would be difficult to have an opinion on the matter without agreeing
with one of us :)

To take your chosen example of CONFIG_NET_RADIO.... if your user cannot
determine that in order to enable support for her WaveLAN card she must
first enable the option marked
"Wireless LAN drivers (non-hamradio) & Wireless Extensions"
then I respectfully suggest that you quietly take her out back and shoot
her.

Unlike the approach taken by your example.
Note that in that particular case we'd probably have the 'guard' option
"Wireless LAN drivers" _anyway_, even if nothing at _all_ depends upon
it other than configuration options.
Just like we have CONFIG_NET_ETHERNET, CONFIG_NET_VENDOR_3COM,
CONFIG_NET_ISA, CONFIG_NET_PCI and other similar options to keep the
config sane.
Such 'infrastructure' options, whether they actually make a difference
to the resulting kernel or not, are perfectly normal, acceptable and
understandable.
