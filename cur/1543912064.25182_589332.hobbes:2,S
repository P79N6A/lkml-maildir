What was the error you got from cryptsetup()? Also, please post the
kernel's dmesg log and the .config of the 2.6.21 kernel (new one).
Also, compare the .config's of the two kernels and ensure that
CONFIG_DM_CRYPT (or possibly one of the _CRYPTO_ config options)
didn't get lost or automatically unset during the upgrade/oldconfig.
