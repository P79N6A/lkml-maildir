Please also check vger.timpanogas.org/nwfs/nwfs.tar.gz:disk.c for NetWare
specific calculations of the CHS values, a different method is used for
NetWare partitions vs. everything else (Novell just had to be different).
If you do not  use their methods on NetWare partitions, NetWare will not
recognize the partition entries correctly, and will attempt to reinitialize
the entire partition table on a system if they are wrong (Ouch!).  NetWare
does a different calculation for conversion of cylinder values above 1024.
