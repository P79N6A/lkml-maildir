A system call does not cause a preemption. In Unix/Linux, the system
call executes in the context of the user. The only time preemption
occurs, as a result of a system call, is when waiting for I/O to complete
or some similar resource. In this case, instead of spinning, wasting
CPU cycles, the kernel gives the CPU to somebody else who could use
it while your I/O is completing.
