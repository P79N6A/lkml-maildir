Hello!
  I got no reply on the first try. Also the patch is not present neither
  in current 2.4 bk nor in 2.4.21-pre7-ac2, so I am resending.

Hello!
   There is memleak on error exit path. Seems there was some confusion
   in the mind of whoever added that zeroing statement.
   The patch is trivial, 2.5 is not affected.
   Found with help of smatch + enhanced unfree script
Bye,
    Oleg
