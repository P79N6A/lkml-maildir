We could get round this easily by draining the serial port of charactesr
on entry to the wait_key method.  This would mean that the user would
have to press the key after the message has been displayed, which I don't
think is unreasonable, and probably reflects the keyboard behaviour more
accurately.
Note that as long as the device (whether it be VT or serial port) isn't
actually open, the characters pressed will be discarded in both the serial
port and keyboard case, so its not like you're storing up trouble later on.
Currently that is the case.
