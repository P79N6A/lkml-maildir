Hmm.. I don't mind the approach per se, but I get very nervous about the 
fact that I don't see any initialization of "inode->i_sb_list".
Yes, you do a
	list_add(&inode->i_sb_list, &sb->s_inodes);
in new_inode(), but there are a ton of users that allocate inodes other 
ways, and more importantly, even if this was the only allocation function, 
you do various "list_del(&inode->i_sb_list)" things which leaves the inode 
around but with an invalid superblock list.
So at the very _least_, you should document why all of this is safe very 
carefully (I get nervous about fundamental FS infrastructure changes), and 
it should be left to simmer in -mm for a longish time to make sure it 
really works..
Call me chicken.
