Nacked-by-me.
Aside of the fact, that it is a bad clone of the timerfd code, it is
simply broken and untested.

How exactly knows userspace what a struct hrtimerspec is ? Is the c file
exported as a header ?

Where is the logic here ? 
If no overrun, return remaining time = 0
If active, return the real remaining time. This path is never hit, as
the timer is nowhere restarted.
If not active, return remanining time = 0. How does the caller know how
many events are missed ?

Interesting feature. evs->overruns is adding up forever and then limited
to ULONG_MAX

Cool. Waiters, which came after the first event are stuck. Simply
because there is no second event.

Creative lockless programming style with 4 lines overhead and a
guaranteed return POLLIN after the first timer event. This is really
cute as it covers the missing timer restart and guarantees 100% CPU load
for ever. Hmm, maybe it's correct: polling should loop for ever,
shouldn't it ?
