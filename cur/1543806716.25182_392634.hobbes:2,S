I don't consider things I've bought to be somebody elses hardware. The 
whole attitude of the big manufacturer that kindly gives me permission 
to use their product only how they see fit is very disgusting to me.

I'm concerned that in a few years time such systems will be rare and 
hard to come by (possibly even illegal). I find such system pissing all 
over the spirit of the GPL. To me, the GPL has always been about the 
freedom of modifying (in place, not making a clone).
It's a fine line before we are in the territory of restricting what 
software can be used for. But for me this is not about restricting their 
rights as much as it is preventing them from restricting mine.

I dislike the former but the latter is acceptable (and, as you say, in 
some cases desirable). There is a big difference between refusing to run 
and printing/logging warnings.

I'm arguing the principle here, not the wording of the current draft. 
Signatures that are required for execution should be covered, those that 
result in warnings should not be. Imagine the shit storm if Red Hat 
decided to ship an rpm that didn't allow packages that weren't signed by 
them.
It's basically about control. I do not find it reasonable to allow the 
vendor control of what goes or not on systems I've bought. They're free 
to put systems in place so they can detect that I've fiddled with it so 
they can deny me support. But if they want to make a completely closed 
system then they'll have to develop it on their own and not use my code. 
"Look but don't touch" is not sufficient for me.
