Read my post again.
A lot of the simple SMTP engines embedded in viruses _don't_ retry on
4xx error codes.  Real SMTP engines do.
That flaw is what we are taking advantage of, to filter out the junk.
I.E. we tell everybody 'come back later'.  Genuine mail does, whilst
junk mail often doesn't bother.
