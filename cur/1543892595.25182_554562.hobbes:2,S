Don't know Jan.  nv, the last time I tried that bucket of molasses in january, 
couldn't drive this card at more than 800x600, and I am used to double that 
both ways.
The last time I booted to nv, it took me a week to get all the crap fixed that 
it overwrote trying to fit the default screens I use while trying to make 
them fit in an 800x600 window.
I run 1600x1200, on either an ati card (but the radeon driver quit supporting  
the r280 chipset according to boot messages, the main reason I bought this 
nvidia card) or on an older nvidia card that nv was quite happy with.  That 
card went belly up and took the motherboard with it 2 years ago though.
Did you miss the comment that it works with a 2.6.21ish kernel?  Everything 
else being equal.  I will boot to one of them later tonight and test it to 
make sure its not some update to kde though, and let the list know.
