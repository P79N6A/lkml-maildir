Ok, now replace "hardware" by "software", and replace DRM by 
"proprietary", and what's the difference?
The fact is, if you buy proprietary software, you cannot make it do 
everything you want, regardless of of whether you "own" it or not. The 
creator of the software may have designed it so that it only does certain 
things.
Tough. The solution: use open source software.
The same holds true for hardware. If you buy proprietary hardware, you 
cannot make it do everything you want, whether you "own" it or not. The 
manufacturer of the hardware may have designed it so that it only does 
certain things.
Tough. The solution: use open hardware.
The solution is NOT to create a software license that is obviously not 
usable. And the GPLv3 really _is_ obviously not usable for the kernel, 
because it creates insane situations whether the hardware is open or 
closed.
In other words, the problem you state is a problem. But it has nothing to 
do with the GPLv3.
