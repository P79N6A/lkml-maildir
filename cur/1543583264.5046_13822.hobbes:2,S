Before even thinking about testing this thing, I'd like to
see some (detailed?) explanation from you why exactly you
think the changes in this patch are good and how + why they
work.
IMHO it would be good to not apply ANY code to the stable
kernel tree unless we understand what it does and what the
author meant the code to do...
regards,
Rik
