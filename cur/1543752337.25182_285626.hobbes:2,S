But classes could always have an arbitrary number of attributes, right?

Hm, I like the idea, but we already allow devices belonging to arbitrary
number of classes (through class_device) today.  What makes this
different?
And how does this change, if at all, sysfs representations of devices
that use this?
Some minor comments about the code:

Can these all be EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL?  It's your choice, as you wrote the
code, but we're trying to keep the driver model stuff all GPL explicit,
as there's no way someone can say it's a "derived work" from long ago
that's using these new functions.

You mean the class_device of the "container", right?
The code looks sane, if not a bit confusing as there's no user of it :)
