Maybe we should have that *as well*, but it makes sense to allow the 
hypervisor to apply a filter too. For example, whether it supports PSE, 
FXSAVE/FXRSTOR, etc. These are things the 'platform' is telling the OS 
-- not something the OS can filter for itself. To trap on CPUID 
invocations requires the guest to use a special code sequence for 
CPUID, since the instruction will never normally fault. Hence moving to 
mach-* to hide this detail.
