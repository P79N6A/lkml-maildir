Who might you be? Whatever, I think, there are tools close to what you
want, like rsync. Given the proper ignore lists, they will do what you
mean quite closely. So it comes down to doing a script with sorts the
proper ignore lists out, then calls upon rsync. This would however mean
we need a publicly accessible rsync:// server with an unpacked CURRENT
kernel tree.
Sounds feasible? Just a light brain wind, not really a brainstorm.
