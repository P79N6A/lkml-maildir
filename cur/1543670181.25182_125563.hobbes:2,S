err.. so what?  Once we've got the spinlock, other writers are blocked
and readers can either see the state before or the state after (stores
are atomic on PA)

Jacob's would break if we hashed to different spinlocks.  But we don't, we
shift right by 8, so we get the same spinlock for atomic things that are on
the same "cacheline" (i think PA cachelines are actually 64 or 128 bytes,
depending on model).
