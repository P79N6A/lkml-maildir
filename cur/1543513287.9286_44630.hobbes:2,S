A friend of mine tried once to make backups of an encrypted filesystem.
That looked easy: just put on a tape/zip/whatever the file containing the
encrypted filesystem. He found out however that that was not doable: each
block of data is encrypted using a seed which is the __absolute__ block
number of the underlying filesystem, where it should be the block number
__relative__ to the beginning of the file containing the encrypted
filesystem.  The consequence is that if you try to restore a backup (or
simply if you try to copy the encrypted filesystem), you obtain something
which cannot be decrypted as the block numbers have changed since the
encryption.
My friend submitted a bug report to the maintainer, and was replied that
``the feature was known, but would not be corrected because it wwas
imported to support backward compatibility with already existing
filesystems.'' Sigh.

It is indeed weird that e2fsck doesn't give up at once before writing
anything.
