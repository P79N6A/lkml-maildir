Okay. Btw, thinking about this more, spin_lock_irqsave_intercpu()
might be problematic even for a single lock L1. Assume cpu1 has
the lock L1, then cpu2 gets an intr, also tries doing 
spin_lock_irqsave_intercpu(&L1). cpu1 now tries to do an inter
cpu function, but cpu2 will not be able to reply. Unless the
inter cpu function uses a suitably higher irq level to interrupt
other cpus. 
Right?
