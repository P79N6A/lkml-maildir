Hi,
I am examining the large file support in Linux. A couple of questions 
remained unanswered that's why I thought to
ask the experts ;-)
I was wondering what the current size limitation of a partition is and 
what kernel versions will allow files larger then
4 GB and why they do that.
Regards,
Iwan Sanders
