Hello.
In 2.4 kernels, chmod/chown requests against /proc entries
return success but the mode/uid/gid aren't changed.
In 2.6 kernels, chmod/chown requests against /proc entries
return success and the mode/uid/gid are changed.
This is because 2.4 kernels don't update
"struct proc_dir_entry"->mode/uid/gid like 2.6 kernels.
( 2.4 kernels don't have proc_notify_change() hook.)
What's the reason for this difference?
Regards.
