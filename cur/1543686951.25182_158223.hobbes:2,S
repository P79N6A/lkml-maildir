Nobody hacking on Linux feels threatened by this.
And if anything, it's the last thing that would make us change Linux
to behave one way or another.  That would be a stupid reason to make a
change to the kernel, just because someone is shitting their pants on
some mailing list endlessly about it.
So please, go ahead, go use another OS if that suits your needs
better, it certainly has no bearing on how we'll make Linux's ARP
behave.
But the one thing you can't do is accuse us of not providing the
facility you need.  Your only valid complaint is that the facility
doesn't get configured in the way that you would like it to, and
frankly my answer to that is "tough".
