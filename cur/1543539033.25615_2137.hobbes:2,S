It is.

True, but it's not the case.

Correct. This is since my one-liner change was incorporated in linux-utils
(NOT in devfs!) more then 8 months ago. So it can be true or false depending
on version of linux-utils NOT depending on version of devfs. With old
linux-utils you can write "0" in securetty and suddenly root login will
be allowed from /dev/vc/0, /dev/pts/0, /dev/tts/0 - in fact <anything>/0
was allowed. Since it does not look good from security standpoint
linux-utils were patched. Now you can specify what you REALLY want:
vc/0 or tts/0 ...
