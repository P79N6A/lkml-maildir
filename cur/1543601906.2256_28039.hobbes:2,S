This is one of the things interrupt handling by threads gives you, but the
performance cost is not nice. When you consider that ksoftirqd when it
kicks in (currently far too often) takes up to 10% off gigabit ethernet
performance, you can appreciate why we don't want to go that path.
Our spinlock paths are supposed to be very small and predictable. Where 
there is sleeping involved we have semaphores.
As lockmeter shows we still have a few io_request_lock cases at least where
we lock for far too long
