can you be more precise? which copyright attribution? my rwsem are
written totally from scratch, they doesn't share anything with the
previous code, it is just a code replacement. As far I can tell deleted
some file, and with it also its headers but that seems not to infinge
any copyright, I didn't removed only the copyright attribution. If I
removed only the copyright attribution please let me know of course,
that would been a silly mistake.
To be pedantic the only idea I shared with the old code (but that's just
the idea, not the implementation, so AFIK only a patent on such idea
could protect it from its free usage usage) is to return the rwsem again
from rwsem_wake and friends to avoid saving it in the asm slow path, and
I written that:
/*
 * We return the semaphore itself from the C functions so we can pass it
 * in %eax via regparm and we don't need to declare %eax clobbered by C.
 * This is mostly for x86 but maybe other archs can make a use of it
 * too.
 * Idea is from David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>.
 */
And the xadd version is scheduled for removal anyways soon btw (David
just dropped it in its implementation).
