It's not just IDE. I have a machine with SCSI and an old 2X CDROM, 
which has troubble reading 80 min CD-R's, which I discovered doing a 
copy of a large file from it. Userspace locked up for a few days, and I 
don't just mean the cp process, I mean everything in userspace. The 
machine responded to pings and forwarded packets (It's my NAT machine), 
but not much else. Forced eject with pin clears it up in that case as 
well.

It's unwanted for the task of anything, especially the 
everything-else-hangs-too behaviour that I observed, that might just be 
due to sim710 though ;-). (Kernel 2.4.18)
