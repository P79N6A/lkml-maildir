I don't exactly see the point here: do some of your cards supports these
media at the same time ? I would have believed it to be set in stone.

Ok.

May I ask what kind of protocol support you have in mind here ?

We can pass (media/clock) through his "media" parameter but I won't claim it
to be sexy. So far, I don't see how we may avoid some tool to do all the
required ioctl.

drivers/net/wan/sbni.[ch] uses the SIOCDEVPRIVATE range for different things.
The x25 protocol uses the SIOCPROTOPRIVATE. I'd rather avoid both.
