Hi,
Someone recently posted a message to Linux Managers about rebooting a box
with a failed drive and no serial console from a remote location. It
turned out in that instance that there was another drive and enough
working to copy a simple reboot binary to it.
Anyway I was wondering whether there is an official "alternative sysrq" in
/proc/sys or if it would be worth me writing a patch to add things like a
reboot entry one could cat "feeldead" to or whatever...is this even worth
doing or been done?
Jon.
