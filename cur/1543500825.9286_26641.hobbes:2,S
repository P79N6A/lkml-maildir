	I have tried with 1, 8, 16 and 32 threads, and it has exactly
	the same bad rate (~ 1,7 Mo/s with 2 clients). HJ L gave a
	try and he reported really crazy numbers. I guess it has
	so much memory that most of the disk accesses are avoided.
	In fact, I am quite surprised that nobody else is able
	to reproduce it. Except the fact that I could not apply
	the whole patch coming with knfsd 1.4.1 (as a result, I
	did not apply it at all) because of conflicts with 2.2.10-ac4,
	I think I have not done anything fancy.
