Andrea provided a quite good fix for the invokation problem. I'm just
tracking down a different problem which was revieled by his changes.
The selection mechanism is currently taking a couple of things into
account:
 - VM size
 - nice value
 - CPU time
 - owner == root ?
 - CAP_SYS_RAWIO
I found out, that it is neccecary to take the child processes into
account to detect processes which fork a lot of childs.
The current mechanism rather kills sshd or portmap as they happen to
have a bigger VM size than the process which forked a lot of childs.
So I added a check for the child processes with an own VM. This solved
the problem quite well. Of course it does not count the childs of PID <
2.
