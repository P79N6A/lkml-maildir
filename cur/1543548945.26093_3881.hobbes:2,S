larry - this one is a bit unfair i think: the innominate.org tree
runs right now on a 200mhz pentium and is quite a bit worse
connected to you than the bk tree - also it's a "synthetic"
tree which contains for instance 100+ tags in the 2.3
tree which might make it a bit slow too ...
but all that does not mean that bk is bad - haven't had a look at
it so far - i just wanted to say: better avoid such comparisions
- i think the mozilla idea (from some mails later) side by side
will give a much better comparision
