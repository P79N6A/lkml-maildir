Subject: funny inconsistency in error returns

I see ENXIO upon open("/dev/hdd"), and ENODEV upon open("/dev/hde");
It is clear why this happens
 (hde has major 33, and blkdev_open does not know it and returns -ENODEV;
  hdd has major 22, known since hdc exists, and ide_open returns -ENXIO).
Both error numbers are OK, but the inconsistency is a microscopic flaw.
Maybe ide_open() should also return ENODEV.

[PS I just added ENODEV and ENXIO to the list of possible errors in open.2]
