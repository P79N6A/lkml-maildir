This is clear. And sure, it shows that caller wants some memory from DMA
zone if it is possible.
What I mean is that, GFP_DMA seems to be not full specifier and only
flag which can be used along with something else. 
Say gfp mask roughly consist of two kinds on instructions:
* what memory zone to use - zone specifier.
* how to behave during allocation (IO, sleep, etc) - behavior specifier.
My concern is will it behave correctly with only GFP_DMA? It seems to
behave like do not use emergency pools and do not wait at the same time
what is risky. Is that right?

Seems that all GFP_DMA users use it with __GFP_WAIT or GFP_KERNEL. And
I'd prefer to add __GFP_WAIT here also.

Sorry, next will use another mailer.
