Well, following the current SCSI black/white list procedure, they would be in 
the static device_list table in scsi_scan.c, so no.
I agree that it's not a nice or friendly thing (and is certainly prone to 
delays when you have to get entries into the actual kernel code), but fixing 
this particular annoyance of the scsi subsystem (although I have actually 
thought about doing it) would be a project separate from the queue barrier 
support.
