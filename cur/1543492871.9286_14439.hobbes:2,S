...and it already exists.  
I wrote swapd many years ago (first started in 1993), as this question
comes up periodically.  The only bit missing is mlock.
I don't use it, but the current version I have is 1.4, available from:
    
http://www.alfie.demon.co.uk/download/swapd-1.4.tar.gz
I am not actually maintaining it currently, I handed over the reins to
Marc Merlin.  I don't have a URL to hand for his work.
