The problem is the following:
	- user plugs in their usb flash reader with no media in it
	- the main block device is create, no partitions
	- user plugs a flash stick/whatever into the reader
	- kernel gets no notification of this event
	- userspace gets no notification of this event
How can userspace know to open the main block device now?  Require that
we put a big "Rescan media now" button on the desktop?  That's one way,
but users are used to having to not do that.  
If a daemon does the scanning every so often, the media can be
automatically mounted, and an application can pop up saying that it
found some pictures on the new device, do you want to open up your image
application?
That help?
