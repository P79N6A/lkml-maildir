The curious bit IMO being STS_INT (0001), which should also have
triggered an IRQ.  Suggesting to me that the race might be lower
level than that ... at the level of a conflict between the various
mechanisms to ack irqs.
See the appended patch (Andre, this is the additional one I meant)
for a tweak at that level.

The driver's spinlock should prevent that particular problem from
appearing.

========= CUT HERE
Modify EHCI irq handling on the theory that at least some of the
"lost" IRQs are caused by goofage between multiple lowlevel IRQ
acking mechanisms:  try rescanning before we exit the handler, in
case the EHCI-internal ack (by clearing the irq status) doesn't
always suffice for IRQs triggered nearly back-to-back.
