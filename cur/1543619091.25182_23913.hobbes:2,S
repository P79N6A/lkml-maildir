I'm still missing your point.  When the parent's page table was instantiated 
we took a fault.  Later, we walk through up to 1024 ptes setting them RO, if 
they are not already (which they probably are).  Don't you think the cost of 
the former dwarves the latter?  In fact, if we are worried about this, we can 
keep a flag on the page table telling us all the ptes are still set RO so we 
don't have to do it again.

I'm not sure I agree with this.  I matters a lot if that rare case happens to 
be the application your using all the time, and then it becomes the common 
case.
