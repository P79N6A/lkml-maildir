No, you don't understand. The git-checkout-script already takes a 
parameter to indicate _what_ to check out. It just defaults to head.
So you'd do
	git-checkout-script branch && switch branch
and you'd be done.
Anyway, I liked the branch semantics for "git checkout" so much that I 
just made it do that by default. In other words, if you do
	git checkout 'branch'
it will both check out the new branch contents and switch HEAD to branch. 
It will refuse to overwrite any data, but as before, you can force that 
with "git checkout -f branch" instead.
If the argument to "git checkout" isn't a branch-name, but some other 
name (like "v2.6.12" or an extended expression like "HEAD^" for "parent of 
HEAD"), it will just check it out, but it obviously won't be switching any 
branches around (and it will leave HEAD untouched).
These seem like sane and useful semantics, and your "switch" script should 
really fall out as "git checkout -f".
