Please name one such box that doesn't support a more sensible order
and is vaguely Linux-capable. The PDP-11 does not qualify, as it's
only 16-bit and could be made to DTRT for 32-bit values in the
compiler if you were going to go to the trouble of making "int" and
"void *" 32 bits on a 16-bit arch and then trying to fit the
resulting bloated code in the 4MB the later PDP-11s supported.
This file is silly.
