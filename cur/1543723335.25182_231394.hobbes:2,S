Trust me, it does.  Unless you fully understand how the MMU and domains
work on ARM, you've little chance of working it out from the code.
Really, I see its pointless trying to discuss the details of this any
further - I presently have very little time to educate people in the
details, sorry.

Wrong.  That means that if userspace passes an address above the hard
coded limit, we _WILL_ bypass all protections and access that memory.
However, ARM26 is not under my control anymore, so it isn't something
I care about, and I doubt there are many people who do.  We're talking
about a 20 year old architecture which hasn't had any conforming devices
produced for at least 10 years.
