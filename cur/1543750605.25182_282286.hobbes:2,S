Humm... yeah, there would be some advantages to that kind of setup. 
Flexable, easier to add/remove things you want done on
install/uninstall. 
However, it seems like it would also be most vulnerable to security
issues. All an attacker needs to do is get a link/file into one of
those dirs and they could execute any commands they like. 
Also, seems like it would be harder to audit and see whats going to
happen on install/removal. 
Are a base set of commands/scripts provided by the kernel package? Or
do they come in some other package?
