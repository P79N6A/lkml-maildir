This might be a good approach to take regardless - don't read pci-pci 
bridge BAR (or host-bridge BAR's for that matter), simply because 
 (a) bridges are more "interesting" than regular devices, and disabling 
     part of them might be a stupid thing.
 (b) we're generally not really interested in the end result anyway
Hmm?
