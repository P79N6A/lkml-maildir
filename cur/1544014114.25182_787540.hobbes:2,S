What, you haven't heard of "UV on a chip"?  It will be in every
smart phone soon... ;-)

Hi Nick,
The problem arises that if the option becomes too obscure (and never
enabled), then it won't get tested.  We (as many companies do) rely on
distros to certify applications and security features using a standard
kernel, and if an option (such as X86_UV) causes any problems whatsoever,
they'll drop it and we no longer have that application certification.
Currently, Ingo's test setup sets MAXSMP quite a bit and he's found
many problems with large NR_CPUS counts that we never would have found
ourselves.  Please don't make that process any harder.
In fact, 13k is peanuts.  Why don't you set something like "very minimal
support" and drop all obsolete features, anything older than a couple of
years, anything not available from Dell ;-)  Perhaps call it "Desktop
System"?
Thanks,
Mike
