"Again." Are you saying it used to work on these machines and then it
stopped? If so I think we have a fix to try in the next ACPI release
(which may or may not make it into the next kernel release.)

Do I hear violins playing? Poor, poor you! :)
The ACPI PCI routing code still isn't 100% correct. Have you tried
pci=noacpi? Have you diagnosed exactly what is going wrong on your
system? Have you checked bugzilla for similar bugs? Have you sent a
patch fixing the problem on your system?

So don't compile it in for now. When you buy a system in a few years
that won't work properly without ACPI, and it *works* because of the
work everyone on acpi-devel is doing, then you'll change your tune.
