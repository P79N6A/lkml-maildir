Hi, 
Having some trouble compiling kdenetwork.
/usr/include/linux/if_ppp.h:90: use of enum `NPmode' without previous 
   declaration
This is defined in ppp_defs.h, but apparently it doesn't get included 
anywhere...  
Should ppp_defs.h be included in if_ppp.h
(that goes for if_pppvar.h too) ?
I see those headers use structures from ppp_defs.h
