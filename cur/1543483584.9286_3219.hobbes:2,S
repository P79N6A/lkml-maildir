It's not just _what_ you ask, it's _how_ you ask it. If he'd showed up 
and just asked about building Linux on small machines, that would
probably have been fine. But he didn't. Instead, he started out a bit
hostile; the kernel hadn't grown to include more features, it was
bloated. People didn't just disagree with him, they were
closed-minded. 
Yes, some people wnet overboard in their responses. Not everybody did, 
however. Really, on a list this size, you have to expect that at least 
a few people will flame you for almost every action. The key to
getting anything done over a public mailing list is to learn to ignore 
those flames. Apparently he couldn't; that's not really linux-kernel's 
problem to deal with.
Instead of dealing with the flames rationally, he lashed out and upset 
even more people. That, combined with his whiny "since you upset me I
won't share all the cool code I've read" retort pretty much guaranteed 
that he wasn't going to get any useful responses.
He had a useful question, but the way he went about asking it could
have been a lot better.
