| Some devices require more than one usb message to set all of the proper
| termios bits in the device.  Creating a way to queue them up and fire
| them off later, and handle errors if something happened in the middle,
| after we told userspace the termios change succeeded, might get quite
| messy :(
 But set_termios() returns nothing, and look what termios
man page says about tcsetattr() return value:
"""
Note that tcsetattr() returns success if any of the requested changes could
be successfully carried out. Therefore, when making multiple changes it may be
necessary to follow this call with a further call to tcgetattr() to check that
all changes have been performed successfully.
"""
 Also, why do they need to sleep? Did you note that my version of
set_mctrl() is atomic?
