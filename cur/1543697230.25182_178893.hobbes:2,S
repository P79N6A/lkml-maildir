A) Any scheme we come up with there will be a way the user can do something 
stupid enough to break it.  (Put the swap partition on a ramdisk living on 
the video card, or on a device require an initrd to load the driver to 
access...)
B) A heuristic that looks at the mounted block devices for things that smell 
like a resume partition would actually be more robust in that case.

Okay, so why is /etc/mtab not supposed to be a link to /proc/mounts again?  
(Especially since we're migrating to a per-process view of the mount tree...)

The alternative is putting a heuristic in either the kernel or grub that 
identifies your resume partition.  The grub hack might not be so bad if 
there's a symlink somewhere that points to the resume partition.  
/etc/resume, /dev/resume, /boot/resume...  Dunno.  Read only root partitions 
don't make this easy...
The objection's largely to having it hardwired into the kernel, but I suppose 
if you now have to specify the root on the kernel command line, having to 
specify resume isn't noticeably worse...

It was unhappy last time I tried it, but that was several months back.  Worth 
a shot...
