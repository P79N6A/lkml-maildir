Right. I think one could use something like ATMEL 89F2051 (20-pin 8051
non-SMD clones with flash and hardware UART) or something similar.
Client I2C is difficult in Linux (using general purpose I/O port) but
with a dedicated CPU it's not a problem (not sure about 400 kHz access).

Well, that's a bit more complicated. I'm not going to try that on
an experimental PCB :-)

Depends on I2C. With something like 400 kHz it should be faster,
probably like 115200.

Actually we have:
- the Xserver "hardware access" issue
- DRI/DRM
- now the I2C bus driver
- frame buffer
To avoid conflicts we really need them managed by a single driver.
Probably the GGI (KGI?) should be revisited?
Long-term project, unfortunatelly, but I think we'll have to do that
eventually.
The I2C, graphics subsystem and DRI/DRM could be sub-modules, with
the master module only keeping track of hardware access, mode
settings etc.
