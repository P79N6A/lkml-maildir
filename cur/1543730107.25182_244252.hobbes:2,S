Sure, but this is about mmenonic. When I see 'or', my mind doesn't make
any link with 'move register' but only with 'or'. I have to process
another term of the line (the 0) to see that the program want to move a
register.

So you writing assembly ppc code with your book on your side ?
because I don't see any reason to associate easily '4,2' with 'not equal'
mmenonics is about associating instruction with what they do.
'bc 4,2' doesn't make me associate that with 'branch not equal' but with
'branch conditional something'. Without knowing the something, that won't
help me figure what the program want to do.
if you're able to decode '4,2' in real time you're very strong, but
you're probably a computer ;)
bdnzltrl kinds of mmenonics are actually not fair, they are not really used :).
But even that I would prefer bdnztlrl which I would have to lookup,
than bclr with cryptics numbers which I would had to lookup too.

There's not 1 opcode for conditional branching. There are more on ppc basis:
	bc, bca, bclr, bcctr, bcl, bcla, bclrl, bcctrl
Thus if you count bnea, bnelr, bnectl, bnel, as new different instructions
compared to bne, then maybe you need to understand why thoses are called
mmenomics.
So as soon as you know those 8 basis opcodes, thoses are actually very easy to
understand. You just need to append the following (which all bourne
script peoples use)
	ne = not equal
	eq = equal
	lt = less than
	le = less equal
	ge = greater equal
	gt = greater than
	....
ex :
bc = Branch Conditional
bca = Branch Conditional Absolute
bne = Branch Not Equal
bnea = Branch Not Equal Absolute
thus from (8 basis mmenonics) + (12 kind of modifiers) I'm able to decode
in real time those 8 * 12 = 96 simplified instructions.

You would better learn few of them and decode them the way it meant to
be, than lookup them all in your book.
That would save your time, your eyes and your desk space ;)
