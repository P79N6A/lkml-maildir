Replace u64 with __u64 in my examples, the point still stances.

This may not be possible.  You cannot account for every internal
thing that kernel header routines might need to do or work with.
Many structures, which the userspace can't control the layout
of etc., makes use of the __u64 type, and we can't just turn off
all those things just because -ansi was specified.
We're talking about things like structures that define the userspace
ABI into the kernel, they use things like __u64.  So what effectively
this means is that when you compile with -ansi you are effectively
turning off access to several userspace ABIs into the kernel.
And this isn't going to be only some obscrure feature like some
CDROM ioctl or whatever, things like "struct stat" use the 64-bit types
either directly or indirectly.
