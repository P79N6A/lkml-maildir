But Matti... usually I agree with you but here you are making no sense.
Why should driver-specific methods contain comments about what other
driver-specific methods should or should not implement? The place for such
comments is sys_close() or filp_close() or anywhere in VFS (e.g. next to
declaration of struct file_operations but _definitely_ not in every single
driver that implements a particular method.
So, BLK definitely does not belong in microcode_release(). Think about
what you would think if you see it there? You would certainly think this:
Aha, BKL is needed around bitmap manipulation - heh, so Linux is so
primitive that it can't even get bitmap manipulations atomic...
See what I mean?
Regards,
Tigran
