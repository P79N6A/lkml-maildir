Thanks for posting some sample code.  Some comments though:
* What if the driver writer does not want MSI enabled for their
  hardware (even though there is an MSI capabilities entry)?  Reasons
  include: overhead involved in initiating the MSI; no support in some
  versions of firmware (QLogic hardware).
* A device (notably, our 4gb PCIe fibre-channel products) can support
  both MSI and MSI-X.  Since the driver has no way of 'disabling' MSI,
  how would it enable MSI-X?
Thanks,
Andrew
