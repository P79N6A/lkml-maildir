Do something like this with your favorite kernel version.....
while true ; do tar -xzf linux-2.6.9.tar.gz ; rm -rf linux-2.6.9 ; vmstat ; done
You can watch this for as long as you want. If there is no other
activity, the values reported by vmstat remain, on the average, stable.
If you throw in a `sync` command, the values rapidly converge to
little memory usage as the disk-data gets flused to disk.
