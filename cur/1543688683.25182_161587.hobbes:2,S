Yep.  I introduced check_gcc into 2.4 (backported from 2.5), in fact.
The above change does exactly what Alan describes, and is a patch I was 
planning to submit myself :)  I did not want to change compiler options 
at the time when I submitted the check_gcc patch, but after many months 
of manually patching to get the best compiler flags, it seems solid.
