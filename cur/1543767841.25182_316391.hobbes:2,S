No, you're confused. Sysvinit catches SIGTSTP and SIGCONT (not SIGSTOP)
because pid #1 is special - unlike all other processes, SIG_DFL for
pid #1 is equal to SIG_IGN.
And remember - signal handlers are not inherited (how could they be..)
so there is no such thing as "init installing a signal handler
for all processes".
Right now you should go out and buy a copy of the Stevens book,
"Advanced programming in the Unix enviroment", and study it.
Mike.
