Which is another way to do something you should not do that way in the
first place, just with a library instead of your own code.
Brute-force scanning /dev with a single thread will not work reliably
in many setups we need to support. Sure, it's good to have it for a
rescue system, it will work fine or your workstation, but definitely
not for boxes with many devices where you don't know how they behave.
Just do:
  $ modprobe scsi_debug max_luns=8 num_parts=2
  $ echo 1 > /sys/module/scsi_debug/parameters/every_nth
  $ echo 4 > /sys/module/scsi_debug/parameters/opts
  $ ls -l /sys/class/block/ | wc -l
  45
and then call any binary doing /dev scanning, and wait (in this case)
for ~2 hours to return.
Also, the blkid cache file uses major/minor numbers or kernel device
names, which will also not help in many setups we have to support
today.
The original btrfs topic, leading to this, is here:
