We discussed configuration via /proc, and it seems worthwhile.  
Maybe I don't understand the details of what you propose.  I don't
find the /proc/<pid> approach attractive because it seems difficult to
administer.  But, setting something global like /proc/realtime/group
or /proc/realtime/any would make a good enhancement to the current
interface.
I have not implemented that yet because (1) the current approach has
proven adequate for the Linux audio user community, and (2) I haven't
wanted to spend time mastering the internal kernel interfaces for
accessing /proc from an LSM.  I know it's not difficult, but I had
other things I'd rather do.  :-)
Thanks for the suggestion,
