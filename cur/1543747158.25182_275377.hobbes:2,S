Yes... I'd say the relative percentage would be much higher, though.

No. Not at all. All of userspace is well and truly wedged in a block of
ice by then.

That's fine if your initrd is properly configured and you're willing to
add extra cruft to the kernel so userspace can get the info it needs,
and report what the user wants to do. If, however, you don't use an
initrd, you're sunk.
Regarding acceptance, there's no point in getting it accepted into the
kernel if we end up with something that's user-unfriendly. I think it
will help a lot if we agree that suspend does need to blur the lines
between kernel and userspace a little, in the interests of providing
software that is superior.
Regards,
Nigel
