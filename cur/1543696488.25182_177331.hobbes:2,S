hello,
i have read the past post in archive, but i still cannot figure how in 
2.4.22 i can use ali magik ide with dma.
when i enable it via "hdparm" the system freeze after short.
in lilo, i have add in append the ide1=autotune hda=autotune, i have 
read somewhere that this can help in detection of hd.
there is somewhere a patch for 2.4.22 that i can use for this problem?
tnx for help!
best regards
