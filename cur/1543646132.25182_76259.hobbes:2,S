I see that RH, in their infinite wisdom, have seen fit to remove
the export of sys_call_table in 8.0 kernels breaking any loadable
modules that wish to implement non-implemented system calls such
as LiS's or iBCS implementation of putmsg/getmsg.
sys_call_table is exported in current 2.4 and 2.5 kernels.
Until now, loadable modules have been able to just overwrite
the non implemented point in the sys_call_table when they load
and putting it back when they unload.  There is no mechanism
for registering system calls.
What is the kernel.org take on this?
