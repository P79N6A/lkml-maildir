This is the Morton method, isn't it? :) I remember it sounding like a
very good idea when he brought it up, but I can't remember the details
of why it was rejected or what the problems were.

Well it basically is suspend to RAM with the additional step that a
new kernel gets booted and writes out the data from RAM to disk then
shuts down. I suspect that freeing memory on the fly for the new kernel
would be non-trivial (but possible), however simply having a reserve
RAM region for the new kernel would be fine for a first step.
