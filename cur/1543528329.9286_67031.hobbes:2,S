We have a Linux server running 2.2.14 version of the kernel that oopses
within a minute of starting NFS (version 2) exports (with the latest NFS
patches applied, although the problem happens just the same with and
without the patches, as well as with the Redhat 6.1 shipped 2.2.12
kernel).
Here's the oops dump:
  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address

The problems seems to be that nfssvc_encode_attrstat gets called with a
NULL resp->fh.fh_dentry, causing the d_inode dereference the cause a
crash.
For now I have temporarily worked around the problem by putting in a
check for a NULL resp->fh.fh_dentry, but surely the problem is upstream
from the nfssvc_encode_attrstat problem. Any ideas?
The environment in which this happens has a lot of Solaris 2.6/2.7
clients accessing the Linux NFS server. There are a couple of
applications that make (light) use of file locks, if that's relevant.
Thanks,
Berend
