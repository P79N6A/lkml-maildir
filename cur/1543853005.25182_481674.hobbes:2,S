So getting back to the main issue in this bug report.....

it would appear that in:
	if (inode->i_sb && inode->i_sb->s_op->clear_inode)
		inode->i_sb->s_op->clear_inode(inode);
inode->i_sb->s_op is NULL.  This is unfortunate :-)
alloc_super initialises s_op to '&default_op' and it isn't cleared on
unmount, so the implication seems to be that i_sb has been freed and
the memory has been reused.  This tends to suggest that
generic_shutdown_super isn't releasing all inodes before the
superblock gets destroyed.
I cannot see how this could be happening yet, but it might be helpful
to compile with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB and maybe even
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC.
That might make the problem trigger earlier and so be easier to track.
