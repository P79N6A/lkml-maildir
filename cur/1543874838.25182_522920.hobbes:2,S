Hi Alexey,
It seems you are fix-rmmod-read-write-races-in-proc-entries.patch author ?
/proc/kcore is no longer seekable (or mappable)
Also, do we really need to proxy via proc_reg_file_ops files that are not provided by a module ?
I think not.
Could you please add in proc_get_inode() a check against de->proc_fops->owner ?
if (de->proc_fops) {
#ifdef CONFIG_MODULE
    if (S_ISREG(inode->i_mode) && de->proc_fops->owner)
        inode->i_fop = &proc_reg_file_ops;
    else
#endif
        inode->i_fop = de->proc_fops;
}
Maybe the whole proc_reg_XXX() functions could be omitted for a kernel without module support ?
Thank you
Eric
