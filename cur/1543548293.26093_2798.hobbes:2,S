Does anyone else make a dual celeron capable mobo that is socket 370?  
The heatsink/fan layout is not-removable from my procs (so I can't put
them into a slot-1 adapter) and I'd like to salvage them somehow rather
trying to ebay them or something.  Spending ~$100 for a new mobo is better
than taking it in the shorts getting rid of them all.
