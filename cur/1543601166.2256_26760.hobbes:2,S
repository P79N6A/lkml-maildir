Yes, but I now (relative) sure, that's ram-timing (it's DDR-RAM on 266
mHz) and cpu-clock are right.
Have found last night, that the box lockup too, if I use the scanner and
scanning a large file.
For scanning, I use an second additional SCSI-Controller (Dawicontrol,
based on AMD 53c974 [PCscsi]). The preview scan is o.k., but the scan
itself stops (and lockup hard the machine of course), if 4-5 mb are
transfered.
Sounds like an interrupt handling error?
