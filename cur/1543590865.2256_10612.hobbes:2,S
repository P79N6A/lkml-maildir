Unfortunately it doesn't. 8139too (and every other driver in 2.2.19 
source tree) uses its own version of netif_wake_queue(). So your patch
doesn't solve the problem with 8139too.
Here is another patch for 8139too that places mark_bh() into the 
netif_wake_queue() macro definition in 8139too.c. 
Or with you patch for kcomp.h is it now better to completely remove 
the macro redefinition from 8139too.c?
My first patch is more of reverse type as it places mark_bh() 
(that was lost) right after the netif_wake_queue() and 
calls mark_bh() more often than it wakes the queue in a manner 
of the older (working) 8139too version.
