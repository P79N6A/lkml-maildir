Yes. The code I attached earlier shows that the poll() in a driver
gets called (correctly), then it calls poll_wait(). Unfortunately
the call to poll_wait() returns immediately so that the return
value from the driver's poll() is whatever it was before some
event occurred that the driver was going to signal with
wake_up_interruptible().
The attached code clearly demonstrates this. It doesn't even contain
any code to execute wake_up_interruptible(). When an event occurs
in the driver that would have set the poll_flag to POLLIN, and
executed wake_up_interruptible, the old status, the stuff that
was returned when poll_wait() returned immediately instead of
waiting for the wake up, gets returned to the user-mode program.
Now, if the user-mode program calls poll() again, which is likely,
it gets the status that was returned from the previous event so
it "seems" to work. However, it is always one event behind so
you need two events to recognize the first one.
I attached the module and demo program again. It clearly shows
that poll_wait() gets called and then immediately returns without
waiting...
Cheers,
