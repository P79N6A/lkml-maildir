Hi,
I've wrote this driver for my Maxi Radio Fm 2 card.
I hope it can be usefull for somebody.
This card uses a GemTek chip, but the GemTek driver wasn't working very well :
the card was left uninitialized, and so it didn't mute.
I didn't wrote a patch for the GemTek driver because the protocol to change 
frequency is different.
This patch is for 2.4.3 kernel - nobody but me tested it yet...
