Well looks that we will start out with the new time subsystem by putting 
some hacks in. I need to check in the funky routine (for setting up the 
fastcall configuration) if the function pointer passed == jitter-compensated-itc
and depending on that set a special flag that makes the asm code do jitter
compensation.

Looks like it. Its not that difficult. Add a jitter compensation flag to
timesource. Check on retrieving from a timesource if its less than last if 
flag is set. Pass the field to the funky function to setup the 
vsyscalls.
Maybe add a general flags field? There may be other things that need to be 
added in the future.
