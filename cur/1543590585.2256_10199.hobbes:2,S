Subject: make menuconfig versus make xconfig, Kernel 2.4

I made an update from Kernel 2.2.19 to 2.4.4, and I made
a copy from the 2.2.19 .config file into the 2.4.4 directory.
After that, I was wondering about the following fact:
"make menuconfig" for kernel 2.4.4 showed (what seems to
be correct) for ATA/IDE the same kernel configuration, as it
was shown in 2.2.19, when using the 2.2.19 ".config".
But: 2.4.4 "make xconfig" using the 2.2.19 .config showed
a disabled ATA/IDE configuration.
Only after saving the 2.4.4 configuration produced by "make menuconfig",
then the configuration for ATA/IDE was correctly displayed by "make xconfig".
