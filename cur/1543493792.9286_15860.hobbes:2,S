Hi Riley,
to answer your second message,
ramdisk support is built into the kernel, Otherwise it could not mount the
ramdisk anyway. The kernel is not changed in the boot process.

I'm loading a compressed ramdisk image from bootable cd (initrd.gz), then
in linuxrc the OTHER ramdisks are initialized and loaded. I give you the
/etc/fstab of the kernel between linuxrc and /sbin/init :
/dev/ram0       /                         ext2            defaults   0   1
/dev/ram6       /mnt                      ext2            defaults   0   2
/dev/ram2       /mnt/lib                  ext2            defaults   0   3
/dev/ram3       /mnt/usr                  ext2            defaults   0   3
/dev/ram4       /mnt/usr/bin              ext2            defaults   0   4
$cdrom          /cdrom                    iso9660         ro,noauto,user 0   0
none            /proc                     proc            defaults   0   0
$cdrom is substituted by the real cdrom name on this system.
The /mnt tree is unmounted, /dev/ram0 ist initrd.
When linux rc exits, on /mnt/etc/fstab there is fstab like this,
but mounting /dev/ram2 to /dev/ram4 is never reached because /sbin/init is
not found :
/dev/ram6       /                         ext2            defaults   0   1
/dev/ram2       /lib                      ext2            defaults   0   2
/dev/ram3       /usr                      ext2            defaults   0   2
/dev/ram4       /usr/bin                  ext2            defaults   0   3
$cdrom          /cdrom                    iso9660         ro,noauto,user 0   0
none            /proc                     proc            defaults   0   0
Mounting of /dev/ram6 is ok, an ext2 filesystem is found. But afterwards
no files are exeted, but /dev/console is found on this filesystem.
I assume that this has something to do with a noexec.
