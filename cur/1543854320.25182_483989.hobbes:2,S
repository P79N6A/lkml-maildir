Can I say a word in defence of STD? It's true that now that I have STR
working(*) for the first time on my old vaio I use it much less, but it
has been my salvation in the last four years, and for this I have to
thanks Nigel, Pavel, Rafael and all the people involved. And still now
it is very useful. I can STD a session with tens of application opened,
and come back after changing batteries  in less than a minute _doing
other things_, and not opening applications and files all over the
place. So yes, I think it's useful. 
And when suspend-to-both will work radiply and safely, that will be
great (and a point over The Other SO...)

(*) if only for this, all the troubles I had upgrading to Ubuntu Edgy
has been worthwhile.
