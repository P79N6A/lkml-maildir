I agree that the current, task-based policies are subobtimal.  Having to
allocate and fill in even a small structure for each allocation is going to
be a tough sell, though.  I suppose most allocations could get by with a
small handfull of static generic "policy structures"...  This seems like it
will turn into a signifcant rework of all the kernel's allocation routines,
no small task.  Certainly not something that I'd even start without
response from some other major players in the VM area...  Anyone?
