Kernel 2.4.18-X (RedHat version)
AMD MP 1900 CPU's
APM is enabled in the BIOS, yet the kernel presumably disables it with a
message along the lines of unsafe for dual CPU's (apologies, don't have
the box in front of me).
The result, as far as I can tell, is that the machine doesn't power off
when executing a shutdown/init 0. It simply displays the "Power Down"
message and sits there. 
Booting with the "apm=power-off" flag doesn't seem to have any effect. 
Could someone enlighten me as to what's up?
