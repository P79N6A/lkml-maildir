I'm working on it. ;)
I've just uploaded a new snapshot of my new VM for
2.4 to my home page, this version contains a
wakeup_kswapd() function (copied from wakeup_bdflush)
and should balance memory a bit better.
Also, streaming IO seems to be almost back on track.
The large IO delays I'm seeing in certain tests have
been traced back to the /elevator/ code. I think I'll
be playing with the "close the door on timeout" idea
Jeff Merkey proposed some time ago...
(I talked about this with Jens Axboe on irc ... a patch
to solve the elevator problems and maybe make a self-tuning
elevator (with maximum latency specified in /proc?) should
be ready later today)
regards,
Rik
