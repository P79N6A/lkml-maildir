It is better than the current solution.
The insert takes the most time, having to scan through the list. If you
had to scan the whole list it would be O(n) with a simple linked list. If
you insert it from the end, it is almost always going to be less than
that.
The time to remove is O(1).
Fetching the first element from the list is also O(1), but you may have to
fetch several items that have all expired. Here you could do something
clever. Just make sure it is O(1) to determine if the list is empty.

The system should be CAPABLE of handling 1000s of interrupts without
excessive system load.
The actual number of interrupts would be reduced if we adjusted the
interrupt interval based on the head of the list.
Two different things.
