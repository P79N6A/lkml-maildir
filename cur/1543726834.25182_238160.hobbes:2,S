Hi Andrew, hi list!
I tried 2.6.8-rc2-mm2 and I still don't get it to work properly for me.
The last kernel which really worked was 2.6.7-mm5. I experience the
following problems:
- USB deadlocking
  USB is still deadlocky, quite often process hang in D+ state.
  Is there something similar to usb-deadlock.fix which I could
  apply to 2.6.7-mm6, but which stumbles over 2.6.8-rc2-mm2?
- psmouse/synaptics
  If I have usb as module, I cannot get synaptics to be recognized.
  Dmitry recommended making psaux driver as modules, but I cannot
  get it as module, because INPUT is automatically set to y, etc
  How is it possible to have USB modular and still get synaptics
  recognized? (or is a modular USB not necessary for S2R now that
  we have CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND?)
To recount the last question:
Is it still necessary for S2R to have USB modular, or is the usb
subsystem slowly ready for use without getting unloaded?
Thanks a lot for the great work and all the best
Norbert
