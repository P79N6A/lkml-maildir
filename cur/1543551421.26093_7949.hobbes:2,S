lotus domino server dies with
deleting all semaphores, shared memory ...
with ipcrm/ipcs does not help, only a reboot does.
any idea what could be wrong ?
i have no idea if this is a bug in linux or domino,
but under linux usualy you don't need a to reboot a server.
are there known issues with ipc / kernel 2.2.18 ?
or with domino or other apps.
the machine is a smp dual i386 machine (ibm netfinity 5500).
regards, andreas
