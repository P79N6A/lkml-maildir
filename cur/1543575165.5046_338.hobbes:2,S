Yes, yes, Alan, I do know that. I just took it for granted that the
correctness of the statement when applied to the latest kernel should not
upset someone who is looking at the older version so me calling someone
"wrong" is not a strong offensive term, just a mild thing saying "guess
what -- things changed". Just trying to exercise the human mind to get
used to quick changes in the Linux world -- that is all :)
