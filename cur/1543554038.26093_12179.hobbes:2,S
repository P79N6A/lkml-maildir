Now that I have looked at the code around it, it looks ok.  It returns
the bytes copied to userspace so far, like a good read function should.

It's been redundant since the 2.1.x days, maybe even before that.  There
-might- be a rare case where a driver really needs to check for the
presence of a PCI BIOS.  Maybe.  But for all cases where you have
	if (!pci_present()) probe_pci=0;
	/* ... */
	if (probe_pci) {
		pci_register_driver(...)
			or
		pdev = pci_find_device(...);
	}
you can remove the pci_present check.  All PCI probe functions return
sane values in the absence of PCI support (or PCI devices).

besides perpetuating a bad idea, that is.
