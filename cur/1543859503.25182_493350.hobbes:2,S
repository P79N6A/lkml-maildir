Thank you for your reply.

I was told to fix an old embedded device, which my
company bought from somebody many years ago. 
It appears to have kernel 2.4.9 and a patched version
of visor.c.
However, I would't bother you with my antiquated
setup. I posted this message only when I started
to think that 2.6 may have race conditions as well.
And I don't have any oops. All I have is a monitor
with 30 lines worse of printk messages. This is
enough,
however, to discover races if printk are in the right
places.

This is because it is my first post on linux.kernel.
I spent time reading FAQs on 
http://www.tux.org/lkml/.
It wastes many pages explaining netiquette, but does
not really explain how to post other then 
"send to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org". That's what I
did.
Thank you
John
