Jiri's patch touched both files containing BSD-only code by Reyk and 
code Reyk contributed to leaving the file dual licenced.

You mixed two completely different things in your email:
1. Jiri's patch (that was never merged into Linux) not only removed the 
   BSD header from dual licenced files but also from not dual licenced
   files.
2. Theo accused Alan that telling people that it was OK to choose one 
   licence for dual licenced code was "advising people to break the law".
Jiri's patch was legally not OK regarding 1. - there's no discussion 
regarding this.
The point 2 is what the email of Theo that was forwarded to linux-kernel 
is about and what the discussion is about. That's quite a rude action 
by Theo unless he's able to prove that this accusation is correct.
