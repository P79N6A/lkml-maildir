No it doesn't!
strncpy() guarantees that the entire destination buffer is written to.
If you call
	strncpy(dest, "foo", 10000)
then you MUST write to 10000 bytes of memory, or your strncpy() is buggy.
Your patches basically turn strncpy() into strlcpy().  Don't do that.
They're separate functions for a reason.
