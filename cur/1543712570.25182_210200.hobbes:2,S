Not really.  Are you using early printk?
The only patches I have which touch drivers/serial/ are
8250-resource-management-fix, linus, pmac_zilog-oops-fix, kgdb-ga.
Lots of patches against drivers/char/*, but I don't see how any of those
can futz the serial settings.  I'm assuming you're using 8250?
