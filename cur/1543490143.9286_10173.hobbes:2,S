I mailed the list a few days ago about a problem I'm having with PPP.
I'm giving a little more updated info now.  
I dial in with PPP (2.3.5)
and connect.
I can get no where. Lookups do not work, pings by IP don't work.
I tried to ping the IP address of the remote hosts IP.  80-90% packet
loss.
Dial back in with 2.1.131 and everything works great. I'm going to now
compile a 2.2.0 plain and see if i can get it to work. (it was before i
patched it).    
Any other information I can give, is no problem.
