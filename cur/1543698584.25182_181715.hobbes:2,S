Right - but then you can't use discontigmem's multiple pgdat's inside
a node to implement hotplug mem for NUMA systems.

Right - that makes perfect sense, it just has 2 problems:
1) You end up with a discontiguous mem_map array (fixable by adding a layer
of indirection in the wrapped macros).
2) on 32 bit, it's going to make a mess, as you need to map mem_map
inside the permanently mapped kernel area (aka ZONE_NORMAL+vmalloc space 
except in a kind of wierd cornercase I created with remap_numa_kva, 
which creates a no-man's land of permanently mapped kernel memory 
between ZONE_NORMAL and VMALLOC_RESERVE area for the remapped 
lmem_maps from the other nodes).

Aahh, maybe I understand now. You're saying you don't support hotplugging
ZONE_NORMAL, so you want to restrict vmalloc accesses to the non-hotplugged
areas? In which case things like HIGHPTE will be a nightmare as well ... ;-)
You also need to be very wary of where memlocked pages are allocated from.
