Rusty, aren't you now going back to the design that I implemented after Ben's 
comments. 
From the get-go, I never touched the user address in the kernel, as I thought 
it would require detailed knowledge of the user level locking strategy.
Could you explain, why you need add_to_waitqueue and wait_for_waitqueue as 
separate calls ? Is it for resolving a race conditions ?
One comment with respect to multiple wait queues and rwsems:
Again it will allow you to do reader-pref and/or writer-pref, but not 
something like FIFO, i.e. wake up a writer if first waiter or wake up all 
readers if first ..... and so on.
I don't know whether the latter is terrible important ...
