That would be me.

reparent_to_init() is there to cope with various strange things
which occur when a kernel thread is parented by a userspace process.
It's called after daemonize(), so the thread can no longer participate
in filesystem related things.
I think what you've pointed out here is yet another problem with
the idea of having kernel threads parented by user processes: they
articificially increase the user's process count.
I didn't have a clear reason for moving the UID to root's - it just
didn't seem a good idea to have kernel threads running with non-root
UIDs.   But we have a reason now - process accounting.
reparent_to_init() needs to decrement current->user's processes count,
and increment root's.  I'll do a patch.
