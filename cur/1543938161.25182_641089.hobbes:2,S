At first glance, this can't happen because all CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU depends on 
CONFIG_HOTPLUG or selects it, for all archs.
But CONFIG_PM_SLEEP_SMP selects CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, without requiring 
CONFIG_HOTPLUG: turning on SUSPEND or HIBERNATION does this.
Perhaps it's time to revisit reverse-depends for select?
Cheers,
Rusty.
