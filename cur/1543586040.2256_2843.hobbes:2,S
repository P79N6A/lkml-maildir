I suppose you've made a mistake writing the continue condition.

I've faced this problem in the past months for ALSA and I think to be
able to propose you a better solution.
I see two problems in your solution:
1) the continue condition is wrong and I'm not sure you'll be able to
indicate one without races with your current fields
2) you've no way to have multiple related counter that need to be read
congruently (i.e. atomically).
3) your solution may be wrong if field values sequences is not
monothonic
I draw my solution:
struct perfcounter {
    int begin, end;		/* both initialized to 0 */	
    u64 counter1;
    u64 counter2;
};
kernel:
s->begin++;
wmb();
update performance counter(s)
wmb();
s->end++;
user:
volatile struct perfcounter *s;
do {
	_end = s->end;
	c1 = s->counter1;
	c2 = s->counter2;
} while (_end != s->begin);
