Con,
Thanks for pointing this out. I have just patched from s7.1 to s7.3
and did notice much better responses under the game...yet music still
skips when moving the mouse very very fast.
Also when playing bmp or xmms and trying to turn on caps lock on USB
kbd there's this pause of a second...but that could be related to the
keyboard itself. I thought i would mention this though.
Regards,
Paul
