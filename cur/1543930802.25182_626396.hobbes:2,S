Now, the jumping back is used to implement "kexec based hibernation",
which uses kexec/kdump to save the memory image of hibernated kernel
during hibernating, and uses /dev/oldmem to restore the memory image of
hibernated kernel and jump back to the hibernated kernel to continue
run.
The other usage model maybe include:
- Dump the system memory image then continue to run, that is, get some
memory snapshot of system during system running.
- Cooperative multi-task of different OS. You can load another OS (B)
from current OS (A), and jump between the two OSes upon needed.
- Call some code (such as firmware, etc) in physical mode.

All dynamic memory required for second kernel should be "loaded" by
sys_kexec_load in first kernel. For example, not only the Linux kernel
should be loaded at 1M, the memory 0~16M (exclude kernel) should be
"loaded" (all zero) by /sbin/kexec via sys_kexec_load too.

The current size is 0x2d7 (727). I got it though objdump,
machine_crash_shutdown - relocate_page. I think we have enough space.

The entry point is filled by assembler code in reloate_kernel_32.S upon
jumping back. You can find it by "grep ENTRY relocate_kernel_32.S".

There is no user of kexec_call() now. But I think it may be useful as a
physical mode caller for some firmware code.
