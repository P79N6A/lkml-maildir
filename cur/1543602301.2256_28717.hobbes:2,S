Hi All,
I was doing a "ps aux" on my K6-3 machine running 2.4.10.  I haven't seen
this posted on the newsflash page yet so I'll post it here.  I noticed
that my X server was reporting something funny:
root       328  0.0  0.0  1004    4 tty4     S    Sep23   0:00 /sbin/getty

What in the world? 99.9% MEM?  At first I thought it was because I haven't
updated my ps tools and such, but they've been working just fine w/ all
the other 2.4.x kernels I've been running.
Next thing: cat /proc/330/status shows:
VmSize:    24376 kB
VmLck:         0 kB
VmRSS:  4294967072 kB

Wow!  Wish I had that much memory!  I thought I only put in a single
128meg PC-100 DIMM...  I don't think it's impacting normal functions, but
I'm not on the console to check if X (X11R6-4.1.0) is still working.

Anything I can do to help you guys figure it out?  It's a production
machine so I probably can't help with full blown debugging, but I'll
produce reports as long as someone tells me what to type in :) I'll leave
the X server alone for a week or so.  Please CC me as I'm not on the list.
