Agreed - and there are all sorts of obscure and wonderful other ways to
trip this up which need the detector (AF_UNIX modular and doing a syslog
for example).

Its playing with fire and doing so to paper over a completely different
problem. The recursion detector is generic and should be sufficient. If
it isn't then it needs improving to be generic, sufficient and working.
