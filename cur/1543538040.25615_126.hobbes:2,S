In short: mostly patch is bunch of band-aids over band-aids. Go read what
Linus thinks about band-aids and SHUT UP!
P.S. Yes, there are exist few interesting points. But mostly it's MESS. Worse
then low-latency patch. And whe you'll think about it is authors of patch do
not want to clean up that mess (and throw out stupid things like non-exec
stack altogether) then why Linus should care ?
