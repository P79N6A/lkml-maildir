Please CC me because I'm not in the list
Here it is:
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> ./scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu74: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
Another strangeness: Some drivers do not build and finding the errors is 
difficult because the error messages come only during linking. When I build 
the kernel usually run this command:
make (bzImage | modules) 2> /some/file .
During compiling i haven't get any compile error, this seems as the linker 
goes searching for files not compiled:
ld: cannot open ircomm_tty.o: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** [ircomm-tty.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [ircomm] Error 2
make[1]: *** [irda] Error 2
make: *** [net] Error 2
Cheers,
Frederik Nosi
