Dear Guru's,
	Here is my config right now :
	    +-------------------------------+	
	    |				    |
	--------			-----------
	i686 box			HP735 10.20
	RedHat 6.0			NFS server
	kernel 2.3.42
	NFS client
	It worked pretty well with kernel 2.2.5-15 but once
	I upgraded to kernel 2.3.42, I did notice a strange
	behaviour on NFS mounted directories having a huge
	number of files : nothing there when doing a "ls"
	from Linux :-(
	I did follow the required instructions told in tree
	<krn-2.3.42>/Documentation/Changes by installing the
	packages below :
RPM:
total 257
-rw-r-----   1 emile    field      164088 Feb 10 11:47 ppp-2.3.11-1.i386.rpm.gz
-rw-r-----   1 emile    field       25804 Feb 10 09:53 
procinfo-16-1.i386.rpm.gz
-rw-r-----   1 emile    field      305159 Feb 10 09:01 
modutils-2.3.7-1.i386.rpm.gz
TAR:
total 1866
-rw-r-----   1 emile    field      808960 Feb 11 11:46 nfs-utils-0.1.4.tar
-rw-r-----   1 emile    field     1081890 Feb 10 11:53 util-linux-2.10b.tar.gz
-rw-r-----   1 emile    field     1052743 Feb 10 11:42 pcmcia-cs-3.1.9.tar.gz
-rw-r-----   1 emile    field       59252 Feb 10 10:02 autofs-3.1.4.tar.gz
	prior switching to Linux kernel 2.3.42.
	From the PC, I tried both NFS mounts from fstab and
	autofs mounts as well with no success so far :-((
	I appreciate any help on this issue. Please let me
	know what did I wrong, or what workaround could be
	easily implemented. Thanks in advance,
