They would be nice, but I'm also in the process of moving patches around
to have the next mainline enhancement up front.

I'm starting to fold patches together too.

That's my next project after ftrace.

This is also being worked on by tglx and Jon Masters.

Yeah, I'll be starting to take a hard crack at getting the irqs as threads
work ready for mainline soon.
As for 2.6.25-rt1, I'm currently working on it. I have the patch queue
ready, but it has some major bugs that I'm stil working out. I did a bit
of clean up in the per-cpu portion as well as some of the mutex code. Now
I need to debug all those changes.
