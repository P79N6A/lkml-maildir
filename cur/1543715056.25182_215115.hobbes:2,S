Hi,
as it was described already, the new 2.6.0 approach for handling some
input devices (mice!) lead to many troubles. As for me, the tp4d daemon
(which is for IBM ThinkPad trackpoint) is very useful and reliable with
2.0, 2.2 and 2.4 kernels, but it doesn't work with 2.6.x.
There is a good problem description at
http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~danlee/fun/psaux/
 and a user space
driver which solves the problem. It works fine with 2.6.3, but not with
2.6.5.
The reason is that in 2.6.5 it looks impossible to disable the existing
mouse driver, which conflicts with driver from Tuukka Toivonen. My
temporary solution was as follows:
--- drivers/input/Kconfig.orig  2004-04-04 07:36:18.000000000 +0400
+++ drivers/input/Kconfig       2004-04-20 03:45:31.000000000 +0400

          Say Y here if you want your mouse to be accessible as char devices
I am not experienced with the modern config managment, but it looks like
a bug in 2.6.5 configuration system. I suggest also to include Tuukka Toivonen
driver in 2.6.x tree, as it is stable, clearly described, and it solves
many compatibility problems.
