That is a bug in your distribution. I cannot fix this.
Maybe the module is blacklisted or whatever. This is _not_ a b43 bug.

The message you quote describes a _completely_ unrelated bug.
Besides that the bug described in the message does _not_ prevent
the device from working. It does _just_ prevent some random LED from
blinking. I'd not call that a big issue.
To say it again: This message was about loading "rfkill-input" _after_
b43 was loaded successfully.
Please carefully read the messages before using them to prove me wrong.

1) I sent this patch out today for inclusion in the kernel
2) This is a _completely_ unrelated issue.
   It is about "rfkill-input" being not loaded. NOT about
   "b43" or "rfkill" not being loaded.

Ok, Please find out why it doesn't work.

Yeah. A problem preventing a LED from blinking.
That's a real regression.... Come on. Stop that bullshit.

How can I fix that?

That's not b43 specific. And it is not a bug. Ignore wmaster.
It is not useful for anything from userspace.

Blame your distribution, please.

How the hell do I workaround broken udev scripts from within the kernel?

Yeah. So PLEASE point out real bugs in MY code and do not bother
me with other peoples bugs that I simply can not fix.
In the list above there was exactly one bug for which I am responsible.
And I already sent a fix for this one.
