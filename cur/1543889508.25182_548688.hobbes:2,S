I assume nobody ever got around to it. CIBAUD is in the PowerPC System V
API supplement for example and is supported by other Power OS's.

BOTHER is for the output speed. BOTHER << IBSHIFT is for the input speed
if it different to the default (and you need B0 << IBSHIFT to know if an
input speed is being specifically set in the first place).
CIBAUD and IBSHIFT come from standards documents so it appears to make
sense at some level to support those standards. As everyone else in the
Power world supports it I don't see why Linux should be different.
