So this is another cgroup-aware block i/o controller. ;)
People are sending different proposals for bio controller. A summary
on this can be found here:
	
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=121798534716673&w=2
And a new proposal sent by Vivek several days ago:
	
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/11/6/227
And there are some discussions about can we modify the elevator layer
and create a common layer so we can provide group control for all
the 4 io schedulers. (in the above mail thread)
You may share some ideas with us.
