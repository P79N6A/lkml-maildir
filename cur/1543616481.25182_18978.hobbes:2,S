the issue is when a task has not rescheduled yet even though the previous
timer tick has has told it to do so. Then we'll have the p->array !=
rq->active condition. If some other event (like a heavy SCSI irq or
something else) delays the task from getting into the scheduler for more
than a jiffy, we can get an expire_task() call again - and hit the
condition.
this situation is especially likely to happen with HZ=1024 or higher.

the 'rq' variable is not 'constant' across context-switch if you look at
what happens on the CPU - we switch away from a task into some other task.
That other task might have a much older 'rq' variable on its kernel stack,
which might be invalid, if the (now executing) task was load-balanced over
to this CPU.

hm, right you are. Will be in my next patch.
