so cpufreq_set_policy() takes policy->lock, and then calls into the
userspace governer code
(__cpufreq_set_policy->cpufreq_governor->cpufreq_governor_userspace)
which calls __cpufreq_driver_target... which does lock_cpu_hotplug().
now on the other side:
store_scaling_governor() has the following code:
        lock_cpu_hotplug();
        /* Do not use cpufreq_set_policy here or the user_policy.max
           will be wrongly overridden */
        mutex_lock(&policy->lock);
so that's the entirely opposite lock order, and a classic AB-BA
deadlock.
