Ok, here we goes again ;)
NCPFS is 2.2.0.18. Both mine NW5 (5.01 SP5) servers are in IP and 802.2 IPX
network. No one single line was changed in my NW servers since last year, but --
as i wrote before -- the amazing thing is in 2.4.5 works! i just change kernel
version... no any other change.
About the support search: Nothing was found with this code number, i'm
mantaining telephone contact w/ Novell support ppl here, to ask what this code
means -- hope they knows.
IIRC, this error was showed me some time ago, when i was in another subnet,
trying to route IPX packets to my servers net, and my router (Linux 2.2.19) was
misconfigured -- i was binding primary to a wrong iface, now it works. My
station -- just one iface -- who is in the same net/switch/room of the server
doesn't. :(
I'm thinking about the module load. It doesn't matter if the module is or not
loaded, the error is the same. Look:
root@condor:/home/hquest# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
root@condor:/home/hquest# slist
slist: Server not found (0x8847) in ncp_open
root@condor:/home/hquest# modprobe ipx
root@condor:/home/hquest# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
ipx                    19616   0  (unused)
root@condor:/home/hquest# ipx_configure --auto_primary=on --auto_interface=on
root@condor:/home/hquest# /sbin/ifconfig eth0

(Yes, AC100000 -- 172.16 -- *is* my IPX net)
root@condor:/home/hquest# slist
