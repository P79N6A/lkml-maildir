I'm puzzled that you've had NFS stable enough to test these.
How much testing has this stuff had? Here 2.5.60+bk clients fall over under
moderate NFS load. (And go splat quickly under high load).
Trying to run things like dbench causes lockups, fsx/fstress made it
reboot, plus the odd 'cheating' errors reported yesterday.
