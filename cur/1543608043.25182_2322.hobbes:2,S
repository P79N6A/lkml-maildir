i686 running 2.4.14-pre6.
In X, switch to console, hit sysrq-m.  sysrq-m output appears.  hit
<alt><f7> to switch back into X.  sysrq help menu appears twice (once
for <alt>, once for <f7>).  hit <alt><f2> to switch consoles.  help menu
appears twice again.
all other key combinations I tried kept interpreting -each- keystroke as
a sysrq command.  ie. once I ran a single sysrq command, I was
permanently in "sysrq mode."
umounted and rebooted using sysrq :)
