Status report:
Due to dependencies, I didn't try the two recommended patches alone.  I ran 
Andrea's 2.4.20-pre10aa1 kernel on the test load for one week.  Low memory 
was conserved and kswapd never went out of control.  Presumably, 
05_vm_16_active_free_zone_bhs-1 did the job for buffers, and the inode patch 
continued to work.
Are there any plans on getting these into 2.4.21?
