Subject: Please revert "fix typo in geode_configre()@cyrix.c"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus, please revert commit e4f0ae0ea63caceff37a13f281a72652b7ea71ba
Rationale:
The thread starting with 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/9/63
 contains 
a discussion about what might be a correct patch.
Somehow the first patch of this discussion made it into 2.6.20-rc, but 
the ones considered more correct are later in the thread.
Since there is AFAIK no actually observed problem fixed by this, it 
should be safe to simply revert the patch for 2.6.20.
TIA
Adrian
