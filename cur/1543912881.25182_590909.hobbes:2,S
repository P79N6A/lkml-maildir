That's the intention, yes.

We _might_ GC the page -- it might not be a new page; we might be
overwriting it. But it's fine if we do. Actually it's slightly
suboptimal because we'll write out the same data twice -- once in GC and
then immediately afterward in the write which we were making space for.
But that's not the end of the world, and it's not very common.

I'll look at that; thanks.

Not before the Kernel Summit now, I suspect. But yes, I'll do that later
today or in the morning (the linuxconf.eu conference has already
started).
