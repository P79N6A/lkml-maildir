Subject: IPsec AH failure over IPv6

Im running performance tests using netperf (patched for ip6) across two 
machines, ESP works great but AH works really bad, practally all the packets 
are droped. Tcpdump reads the packets but they are not passed on to netperf. 
Read somewhere the IPsec Ah doesent like fragmentation over tcp, but im not 
sure. Im using manual keying, and the 2.5.75 kernel. Is there a kernel patch 
to fix this!!
regards
steven
