   Its caught errors before that probably avoided people losing
   data. Its a good sanity check. The "stupid" defaults are two other things
	   o	Using 1K blocks on large disks (4K is way faster) and
		   4K checks way faster too
	   o	Not using the "sparse superblock" option on large disks
		   when creating them.
These defaults are changed in e2fsprogs 1.18.   Unfortunately Linux 2.0
kernels don't support sparse superblocks.  I have patches to allow 2.0
kernels to support sparse superblocks, though.  E-mail me if you're
interested. 
   Unfortunately I dont think there are any "in place" fixers for those
   creation time choices
Nope, unfortunately not for blocksizes.  If you have an old filesystem
using 1k blocks, you'll have to do a dump/mke2fs/restore pass to change
it to use 4k blocksizes.
If you just want to enables sparse superblocks to get some space back,
you can do that by running "tune2fs -s 1 /dev/XXX", and then running
"e2fsck -f /dev/XXX".
