rpm.org case is even worse. Original maintainer still develops rpm - at this 
moment version 4.4.7 at 
http://wraptastic.org/
 (while rpm.org starts from 
older 4.4.2 codebase), there is active mailing list, so we have two running 
projects with the same name which is bad thing and will cause confusion.
I hope that there will be one util-linux and one rpm project.
