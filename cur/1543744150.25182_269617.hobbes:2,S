Hi All,
Is there a mechanism through which I can register a
function within the kernel such that, the registered
function gets called, whenever a process exits or
dies.
Basically, I am implementing socket kind of a
communication mechanism. Here, if the process that
created the socket dies, I want to release the socket
and all associated data structures inside the kernel.
Regards,
Praveen C K.
