The case we've benchmarked (spidernet) is the common preallocated case.
For allocate on demand I'd expect the slab allocator to get things right.
We do have the irq on the right node, not through MSI but due to the odd
interreupt architecture of the Cell blades.

The patches I have add the node field to struct net_device and use it.
It's set via alloc_netdev_node, a function I add and for the normal case
of PCI adapters the node arguments comes from pcibus_to_node().  It's
arguable we should add a alloc_foodeve_pdev variant that hids that detail,
but I'm not entirely sure about whether it's worth the effort.
