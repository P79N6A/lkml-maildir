And you are assuming that everybody follows the rules.
when a PHB, whether military or not (and not contractor) comes in and
says "... I don't care what it takes... get that data over there NOW..."
guess what - it gets done. Even if it is "less secure" in the process.
Oh - and about that "physically destroyed" - that used to be true.
Until it was pointed out to them that destruction of 300TB of data
media would cost them about 2 Million.
Suddenly, erasing became popular. And sufficient. Then it was reused
in a non-secure facility, operated by the same CO.

Yes they are. But they are NOT reliable.
Don't ever assume a "secure" network really is.
All it means is: "as secure as we can manage"
