Hi!
Thank you for your responses. 
ldd doesn't seem to work. It seems that the exec-call can't find the
file. And ldd doesn't work, and if i remember right it is because it
executes a binary with 0 command line parameters.
<test@michael>:~/ns45/communicator-v45.x86-unknown-linux2.0/netsc>ldd
./netscape
ldd: can't execute ./netscape (No such file or directory)
<test@michael>:~/ns45/communicator-v45.x86-unknown-linux2.0/netsc>
So I tried another trick: I straced a bash shell in which I tried to
start the program.
<test@michael>:~/ns45/communicator-v45.x86-unknown-linux2.0/netsc>strace
-o xxxxx -ff bash
<test@michael>:~/ns45/communicator-v45.x86-unknown-linux2.0/netsc>./netscape 
Process 9567 attached
Process 9566 suspended
bash: ./netscape: No such file or directory
Process 9566 resumed
Process 9567 detached
<test@michael>:~/ns45/communicator-v45.x86-unknown-linux2.0/netsc>exit
<test@michael>:~/ns45/communicator-v45.x86-unknown-linux2.0/netsc>
In the  file xxxxx.9567 (see below) the execve-call returns ENOENT. So
the bug must be somewhere in the execve-call.
As the file isn't executed at all, this can't be a library-problem here,
because the libraries normally are loaded after the exec succeeded.
The following stat on the file is successful.
...
sigaction(SIGQUIT, {SIG_DFL}, {SIG_IGN}) = 0
sigaction(SIGTERM, {SIG_DFL}, {SIG_IGN}) = 0
sigaction(SIGCHLD, {SIG_DFL}, {0x8013d90, [], 0}) = 0
execve("./netscape", ["./netscape"], [32 vars]) = -1 ENOENT (No such
file or dir
ectory)
stat("./netscape", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0555, st_size=12179036, ...}) = 0
open("/usr/share/locale/C/LC_MESSAGES", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such
file or d
irectory)
stat("/etc/locale/C/libc.cat", 0xbfffecf8) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
director
y)
stat("/usr/lib/locale/C/libc.cat", 0xbfffecf8) = -1 ENOENT (No such file
or dire
ctory)
stat("/usr/lib/locale/libc/C", 0xbfffecf8) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
director
y)
stat("/usr/share/locale/C/libc.cat", 0xbfffecf8) = -1 ENOENT (No such
file or di
rectory)
stat("/usr/local/share/locale/C/libc.cat", 0xbfffecf8) = -1 ENOENT (No
such file
 or directory)
write(2, "bash: ./netscape: No such file o"..., 44) = 44
_exit(126)                              = ?
For a comparison I straced a bash which executed the command
 /bin/echo test
<test@michael>:~/ns45/communicator-v45.x86-unknown-linux2.0/netsc>strace
-o yyyyyy -ff bash
<test@michael>:~/ns45/communicator-v45.x86-unknown-linux2.0/netsc>/bin/echo
test
Process 9584 attached
Process 9581 suspended
test
Process 9581 resumed
Process 9584 detached
<test@michael>:~/ns45/communicator-v45.x86-unknown-linux2.0/netsc>exit
<test@michael>:~/ns45/communicator-v45.x86-unknown-linux2.0/netsc>
Then the file yyyyyy.9584 contained:
...
sigaction(SIGCHLD, {SIG_DFL}, {0x8013d90, [], 0}) = 0
execve("/bin/echo", ["/bin/echo", "test"], [32 vars]) = 0
mmap(0, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|0x20, 4294967295, 0) =
0x4000600
0
mprotect(0x8000000, 3742, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC) = 0
stat("/etc/ld.so.cache", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=6401, ...}) = 0
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 4
mmap(0, 6401, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, 4, 0) = 0x40007000
close(4)                                = 0
open("/usr/local/kde/lib/libc.so.5", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file

ctory)
open("/usr/local/qt/lib/libc.so.5", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file

tory)
open("/usr/lib/libc.so.5", O_RDONLY)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
directory)
open("/usr/local/lib/libc.so.5", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
director
y)
open("/usr/X11/lib/libc.so.5", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
directory)
open("/lib/libc.so.5.3.12", O_RDONLY)   = 4
read(4, "\177ELF\1\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3"..., 4096) = 4096
mmap(0, 724992, PROT_NONE, MAP_PRIVATE|0x20, 4294967295, 0) = 0x40009000
...
After the (successful) execve the process searches for the libraries.
Greetings, Michael
