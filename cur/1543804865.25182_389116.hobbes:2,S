One option I can think of that would make it much safer would be to  
originally set up your RAID like this:
                md3 (RAID-5)
        __________/   |   \__________
       /              |              \
md0 (RAID-1)   md1 (RAID-1)   md2 (RAID-1)
Each of md0-2 would only have a single drive, and therefore provide  
no redundancy.  When you wanted to grow the RAID-5, you would first  
add a new larger disk to each of md0-md2 and trigger each resync.   
Once that is complete, remove the old drives from md0-2 and run:
   mdadm --grow /dev/md0 --size=max
   mdadm --grow /dev/md1 --size=max
   mdadm --grow /dev/md2 --size=max
Then once all that has completed, run:
   mdadm --grow /dev/md3 --size=max
This will enlarge the top-level array.  If you have LVM on the top- 
level, you can allocate new LVs, resize existing ones, etc.
With the newly added code, you could also add new drives dynamically  
by creating a /dev/md4 out of the single drive, and adding that as a  
new member of /dev/md3.
Cheers,
