find some minor cleanups below.
a more general question is, shouldnt the configuration method rather be 
something like:
   echo idle > /sys/kernel/idle
and there could also be a /sys/kernel/idle_methods which would enumerate 
all the strings that are possible? This way we'd not hardcode 
'idle-poll' in any way.
