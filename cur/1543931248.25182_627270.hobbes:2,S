I don't know if this patch is trying to solve this (->) problem, but there
is a desire for drivers to have a decent way to tell if the kernel that
is executing is a kexec/crash kernel or not.  If it is a kexec/crash
kernel, then (some) drivers may not allocate as many buffers as they
normally do, since the kernel would likely be configured to use
less memory.  The solution doesn't have to involve sysfs .. or it could.
