Thing is, if this runs rock solid now, it's not necessarily indicative
of a bug in agpgart, it could equally be a bug in the DRM.
This disables a whole bunch of code, it's practically a completely
different application wrt 3d now.
Of course, if this _is_ a bug in agpgart, I'll be the first to put
my hands up.
