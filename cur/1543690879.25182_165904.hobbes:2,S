I'll go even farther, and say that one might call the GPL_ONLY
symbols an "effective technological measure" that "effectively
controls access to a work" and "effectively protects a right of a
copyright owner ... in the ordinary course of its operation....".
Bypassing GPL_ONLY symbols, as recently advocated by David
Schwartz and Andre Hedrick, could be considered circumvention of
an effective technological measure.  Remember Dmitry Sklyarov,
