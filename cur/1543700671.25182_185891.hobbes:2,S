There are some old SLS versions lying around here:
http://grumbeer.dyndns.org/ftp/linux/dist/SLS/
and other places but they are all binary from what i can tell.  Anybody
have any idea where a source tree for SLS might be?  I'm finding it very
hard to track down this stuff (before my time).  Were there any distros
that included source by default or were free that we could look to? 
Anyone? Put on the way-back caps.
