good, we can relax the ZONE_NORMAL later, that's a separate problem with
skipping the bounces.
I can see one mm corruption race condition in the patch, you missed
nested irq in the for kmap_irq_bh (PIO).  You must _always_
__cli/__save_flags before accessing the KMAP_IRQ_BH slot, in case the
remapping is required (so _only_ when the page is in the highmem zone).
Otherwise memory corruption will happen when the race triggers (for
example two ide disks in PIO mode doing I/O at the same time connected
to different irq sources).
