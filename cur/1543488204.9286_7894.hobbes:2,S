I'm semi-back from the FLU..............
You two will need to clue me in some.

UDMA is a superset of DMA, and if you turn off DMA so goes UDMA.
Note the converse does not happen.

Recompile with the CONFIG_AUTODMA option disabled.
Next, turn on DMA/UDMA support in the BIOS.
Then boot new kernel.
Get hdparm-3.5 plus hdparm-3.5f.patch from URL at bottom.
patch -p0 < hdparm-3.5f.patch inside hdparm-3.5/ directory.

Now do you get UDMA or (U)DMA, there is a difference.
The latter states that the BIOS failed to be enabled or setup UDMA support
correctly, and the former is obvious that everthing is fine.

No, unless you are doing heavy disk IO; however, program start times will
be longer.
The Quantum SE, ST, EL, and EX series are all fully compliant with Linux
and UDMA, provide the mainboard or host adapter is okay.

I need more info, but do it off the list for now.
