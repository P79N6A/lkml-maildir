Yeah, I won't argue against that too much. I'm a pure git user myself, 
although my patterns tend to be different from most other people (only 
fairly small code changes, and mostly merging other peoples code: I end up 
often touching source code more when I do some trivial manual conflict 
resolution than at most other times..)
And yes, making "git diff" as efficient as possible was definitely one of 
the things that I worked on, exactly because it is how I work when I do 
end up working on something: continually reminding myself what the other 
changes I did were..
So "git" should work fine for pretty much any normal development, but a 
patch maintenance system it ain't.
