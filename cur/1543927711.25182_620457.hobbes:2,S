Normally it's not a problem. But your proposed change can push a
working system into a non-working system by making non-critical I/O on
an unrelated filesystem have higher priority than the thing that -actually
has real-time constraints-.
In other words, I/O priority is per-spindle and not per-filesystem and
thus this change has consequences that leak outside the filesystem in
question. That's bad.
I'd further add that the kernel internals probably shouldn't wander
into RT priority levels unless it's actually doing priority
inheritance, otherwise it's quite likely to upset the careful
considerations of the RT system designer's priority schemes. For
instance, a log-heavy but otherwise non-RT load with this patch could
possibly completely starve direct I/O to another partition even though
it's marked RT, thus livelocking the system.
To the general PVR problem: they typically want to work with a minimum
of buffering to maximize responsiveness to user commands (fast
forward, jump 30 seconds, play in reverse). Now consider that you're
recording and playing back multiple HD streams on low-margin set-top
hardware and you'll see that making this work -at all- means lots of
I/O tuning.
