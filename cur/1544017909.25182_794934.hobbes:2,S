I'd just complain loudly and refuse to accept the constraints if they
are clearly broken like that.
One thing I would suggest is a slightly weaker version which marks the
regulator to be turned off at boot rather than always off.  That's
slightly more flexible and would achieve the same effect if the
constraints don't otherwise allow for turning the regulator on layer.

It doesn't do *that* much harm - if nothing else it makes it more
discoverable what's happening.
