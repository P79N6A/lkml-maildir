The [sym|ncr]53c8xx drivers do initialize the proc fs stuff (proc_name for
recent kernels) in the Scsi_Host_Template if PCI is present and user wants
the controllers to be registered in the proc FS. On the other hand, the
`proc_name' field appeared in some 2.3.X kernel version (sym53c8xx says
Linux-2.3.27). In previous kernel versions, SCSI drivers had to make
`proc_dir' field point to a `proc_dir' structure that allowed proc/FSing
the controller to be optionnable.
We have to decide if we want proc/FSing SCSI controllers (event when none
will be attached or BUS does not even exist) to be optionnal or not.
- If it is optionnal, then proc_name=NULL should be interpreted as
  proc/FSing option disabled.
- Otherwise, the proc_name field should be required to be not NULL.
