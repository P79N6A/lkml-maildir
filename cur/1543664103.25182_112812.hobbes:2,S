Hi!
I am trying to use an ancient DTC 3181e SCSI card with
the 2.4.20 kernel. However, whenever I load the
g_NCR5380 module with a SCSI device on, it inmediately
freezes the computer hard. The system gets completely
hung, needs a hard reset to restart (no Alt-SysRq
magic keys available).
I've been looking for information on the Net, but I
could not find anybody with similar problems.
Does anyone have current information about this
card/driver combination? Or whom I could reach to ask
questions about the driver?
Please CC to me, as I am not subcribed to the list if
you have information.
Thank you very much!
Bye & Good Luck!
Pablo B.
