I don't use firewire, sound and so on, therefor I can't tell you my results
regarding this.

I'll let it run now... Let's see. If the machine crashes I don't mind too much.
It's just an old Compaq AS1000 5/333 only used by me as Alpha-teststation and
some kind of "fileserver".
If it works well now and hopefully without crashing, I believe 2.6 will also
work fine... :-)
