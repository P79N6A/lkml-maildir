that *was* the complete patch -- its purpose was simply to make
asm-generic/ioctl.h general enough to allow arch-specific ioctl.h
files to *subsequently* be simplified.  there was no need to do
*everything* in one step -- each simplification could be submitted as
a separate arch-specific patch, as many things are.
i was more asking about the *philosophy* of that patch, and whether
there were any obvious objections.
