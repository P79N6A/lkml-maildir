I have this identical problem using a 2.6.3-bk snapshot from a few days 
ago. My hardware is a Samsung ML-2150 printer (USB 2 High Speed) 
connected to a VIA EHCI embedded in my VIA KT-600 chipset.
I sent a four page print job through CUPS; during page 4, the printer 
timed out, and the CUPS "usb" process was hung and would not respond to 
any signals (not even -9). When I unplugged the printer's USB cable, the 
"usb" process died, and my syslog reported these error messages (but not 
before I unplugged the cable). In my case I had 3,458 of them.
Plugging the printer back in, usblp re-registered it, so I tried sending 
a job again, but could not get any data to flow to the printer without 
restarting the Linux system.
