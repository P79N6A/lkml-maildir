Hi all!
I have a Toshiba SCSI CD-ROM which the kernel does not detect as CD-ROM.
It
reports 'sdc' for it.
So I looked at the kernel source code and saw some changes in
drivers/scsi.c
between 2.2.12 and 2.2.13 . I added the following line after line 300 of
drivers/scsi.c in my kernel 2.2.13:
{ "TOSHIBA", "CD-ROM XM-3501TA", "*", BLIST_ISROM },
It works for me but I'm not sure if this is correct. In kernel 2.2.12
it's 
done at line 758-763 for everything that looks like "TOSHIBA", "CD-ROM".
Perhaps there are more Toshiba CD-ROM's which are not detected
correctly.
Martin
