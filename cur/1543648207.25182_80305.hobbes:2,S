How ? The only safe way I can see would be to spin lock around the NMI
(and try lock when an NMI arrives).  This would either make every NMI
contend on a single spinlock, or require a NR_CPUS-sized array of
spinlocks, which is just ugly. And that wouldn't solve the
power-management problem - any NMI users need to collaborate to disable
NMI generation on a suspend.
