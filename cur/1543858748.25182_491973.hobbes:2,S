Sorry, this is still unsuitable for mainline.

Please use the standard format, do not obfuscate these.  The kernel
community utterly abhors this.

Where is the check that the host can do byte-wise data transfers?

So writing to this file with a card which is not lockable results in
deadlocking the host.  Suggest you do as other subsystems do and have
one exit path, and use gotos, setting the appropriate return code in a
variable.  If everything goes via that it forces you to think about
where you want to jump to in each case.
