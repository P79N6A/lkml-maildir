You'll block also before to go out of memory if the allocation rate is
high enough.

Before calling schedule() you always gets registered in a waitqueue so
you can't deadlock or wait too much.
If something there is the opposite problem. If you do:
	__set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
	get_page(GFP_KERNEL);
	XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
	schedule();
then at point XXXXXXX you may become a task running and you don't block
anymore.
