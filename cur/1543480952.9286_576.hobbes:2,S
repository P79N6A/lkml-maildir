Maybe I'm talking out of my ass here, but to prevent "nice -20"
processes from hogging a resource indefinitely, wouldn't it be enough to
temporarily bump them up (i.e treat them like "nice -19") when they are
actually holding one?
When they aren't holding any lock or waiting on anything (which should
be most of the time anyway on background computation tasks), they can be
scheduled only if there's nothing else to run.
