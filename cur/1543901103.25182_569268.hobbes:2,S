Hi,
I run a java application at nice 15.  Its been a background application here for as long
as SD and CFS have been around.  If I have a compile running at nice 0, with v19 java 
gets so little cpu that the the wrapper that runs to monitor it is timing out waiting for 
it to start.  This is new in v19 - something in v19 is not meshing well with my mix 
of applications...
Kernel is gentoo 2.6.22-r1 + cfs v19
How can I help to debug this?
