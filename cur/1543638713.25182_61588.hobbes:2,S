I'd say that it's waiting for journal lock that was captured by kupdated
(or something like that) doing periodic write_super() calls, when it thinks
memory is low. Our tests some time ago shown that once memory is lower than
some value, write_super() "method" is called for every superblock that
have "dirty" flag set. In reiserfs that flushes the journal, and while journal
is being flushed, nobody can create new transactions obviously, and since
ls changes directory's atime in normal case, it want to open new transaction.
Unfortunatelly dirty flag for reiserfs gets set way to often than necessary,
we have some patches that should help this (from Chris Mason).
You can try these for yourself too, for example from here:

Ah, I thought call trace was from 2.4.18-3.

So you might try the patch I mentioned or you can mount with nodiratime mount
option to prevent updqting of directory atimes, but having atimes still to be
updated on regular files at the same time.
