I've seen windows installers doing *very* suspect stuff.
I distrust realplayer, too, but I think those people are bad enough
that there's no point complaining. I believed Larry could see that
binary installers are evil.

Yep.

Actually, I only ever did binary installation of realplayer, as far as
I can remember. And that was at time national television died, and I
wanted to know what's going on.

strace does not solve the problem (it is trivial to detect you are
traced), and I do not think Larry should require me to objdump
installer.
[You see, binary-only installers are total nightmare from security
perspective. They are widespread on windoze, and it *is* problem
there. I do not want them on linux.]
