I always get suspicious when I see a lock around a plain assignment. 
Sometimes it's legitimate, usually when some other user of the LHS expects
its value to be stable across an entire locked region - it is read multiple
times and those reads are expected to return the same thing.  (I can't
think of any other case).
Maybe this is such a case?
