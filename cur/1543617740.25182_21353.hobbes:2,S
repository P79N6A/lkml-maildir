Yes, in bytes. blkpg.c has to be fixed.
Several people submitted patches. Sooner or later I suppose
this will be fixed.
Then Tim Pepper answered, and he is wrong:
    Wouldn't it be better to do the following (against 2.4.17).
    +            else {
    +                if (hardsect_size[MAJOR(dev)][MINOR(dev)]) {
    +                    ullval *= hardsect_size[MAJOR(dev)][MINOR(dev)];
    +                } else {
    +                    ullval *= 512;
    +                }
                     return put_user(ullval, (u64 *)arg);
    +            }
You see, the 512 here is 512, and has no relation to hardware
sector size. Multiplying with hardsect_size[][] is a bad bug.
Indeed, you can check this in fs/partitions/msdos.c, where
one reads
	int sector_size = get_hardsect_size(to_kdev_t(bdev->bd_dev)) / 512;
	...
	offs = START_SECT(p)*sector_size;
	size = NR_SECTS(p)*sector_size;
	...
	add_gd_partition(...);
So, indeed, we have already multiplied by hardsect_size, struct gendisk
uses sectors of size 512, independent of the hardware, and we must not
again multiply by hardsect_size.
Unfortunately Matt Domsch replied:

but he meant: No!
