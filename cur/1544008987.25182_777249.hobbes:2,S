Also, the CardBus bridge and what's behind them are quite different
(and we use different firewire stacks).
Mine is:
02:06.0 CardBus bridge [0607]: Ricoh Co Ltd RL5c476 II [1180:0476] (rev ba)
        Kernel driver in use: yenta_cardbus
        Kernel modules: yenta_socket
02:06.1 FireWire (IEEE 1394) [0c00]: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C832 IEEE 1394 Controller [1180:0832] (rev 04)
        Kernel driver in use: ohci1394
        Kernel modules: ohci1394
02:06.2 SD Host controller [0805]: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C822 SD/SDIO/MMC/MS/MSPro Host Adapter [1180:0822] (rev 21)
        Kernel driver in use: sdhci-pci
        Kernel modules: sdhci-pci
02:06.3 System peripheral [0880]: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C843 MMC Host Controller [1180:0843] (rev ff)
        Kernel driver in use: ricoh-mmc
        Kernel modules: ricoh_mmc
(The ricoh_mmc module disables the last one.)
While Rafael has:
03:0b.0 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCIxx12 Cardbus Controller
	Kernel driver in use: yenta_cardbus
	Kernel modules: yenta_socket
03:0b.1 FireWire (IEEE 1394): Texas Instruments PCIxx12 OHCI Compliant IEEE 1394 Host Controller (prog-if 10 [OHCI])
	Kernel driver in use: firewire_ohci
	Kernel modules: firewire-ohci
03:0b.3 SD Host controller: Texas Instruments PCIxx12 SDA Standard Compliant SD Host Controller (prog-if 01)
	Kernel driver in use: sdhci-pci
	Kernel modules: sdhci-pci
