Uhmm.. mixed.
It behaved REALLY strangly until I fixed these typoes:

should be

Then it sort-of worked - my problem keys gave nice up/down
transitions.
However the hardware autorepeat and the software autorepeat seemed to
interfere with each other and auto-repeat was rather erratic.
More of a problem was that control and shift would auto-repeat, and
would often appear to be "up" when I was holding them "down", so
control-X keys strokes were not reliable.
Thanks,
