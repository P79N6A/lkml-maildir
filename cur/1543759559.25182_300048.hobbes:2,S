Driver updates are a hard problem.  Nothing annoys users more than
unsupported hardware.  But if you aggressively add support for new
devices you can break things that have worked for ages.
A change that makes your hardware work may break someone else's.  There
is no such thing as an obviously correct patch when you are flipping
bits in the hardware.  You can never eliminate 100% of driver
regressions, all you can do is minimize the impact by getting release
candidates tested on the widest possible range of hardware.
