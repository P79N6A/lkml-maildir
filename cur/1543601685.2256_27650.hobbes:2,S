Damn..someone has to make good stable motherboards...anyone got any
suggestions for one that will fit into a 1U server, with built-in
Video and preferably a NIC?  I had ok luck with an Intel board based
on the 815 chipset, so long as I used the e100 driver...maybe I'll
have to go back to it...
Thanks,
Ben
