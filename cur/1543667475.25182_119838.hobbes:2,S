hi,
	i dont think there is one similar to gethostbyname in the 
kernel-space.  I do think so because most of the work done by 
gethostbyname is based on the nameservices and is generally not required 
in the kernel-space.  Implementing it should not be that big a problem.
once you have the IP of the name server (/etc/resolve.conf???) you can 
always connect to it and get the IP of the given host.
