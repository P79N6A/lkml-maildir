 Why:	Noone uses it, and it probably does not work, anyway. swsusp is
 	faster, more reliable, and people are actually using it.
 Who:	Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz>

+---------------------------
+
+What:	PCI Name Database (CONFIG_PCI_NAMES)
+When:	July 2005
+Why:	It bloats the kernel unnecessarily, and is handled by userspace better
+	(pciutils supports it.)  Will eliminate the need to try to keep the
+	pci.ids file in sync with the sf.net database all of the time.
