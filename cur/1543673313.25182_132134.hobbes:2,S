Could somebody please change the error message? Although everybody
seems to want to be a lawyer, even lawyers don't make law. Certainly
Software Engineers don't. The correct word is 'invalid', not 'illegal'.
Yes, I know there is a 30-year history of the use of that word in
Unix, but it's wrong. Only governments make law.
Cheers,

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
