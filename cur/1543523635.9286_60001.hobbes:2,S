Won't we confuse lots of pieces of code when their
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE process is returned to them as
a TASK_RUNNING one?
I'm somewhat afraid that we will break code whichever
way we go. That's why I've added a no-sleep workaround
to __get_free_pages() (hey, this isn't happening often
enough to run us out of memory) and added the printk()
to warn us about potentially dangerous code.
regards,
Rik
