That's what much of the document went on about. The

Sure. I already noted this.

There is no meaningful object.
subject: process 12345
object: ??????
operation: lock memory
For a few capability bits, there is a meaningful object
and you could use SELinux in place of the capability bits.
For most of the capability bits, this is not the case.

Stephen Smalley suggested that SELinux could take the
place of our capability bits. So I'm asking how you do
that, using the most minimal SELinux config.
If he really has a way, then there is no need to change
the execve() behavior in the Linux 2.6.x kernels.
Perhaps we just need an LSM hook to re-add the capability
bit after execve() drops it. That's a tiny change that
doesn't affect any existing system.
