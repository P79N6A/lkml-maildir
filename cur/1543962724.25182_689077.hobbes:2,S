Given:
config A
	tristate "a"
config B
	tristate "b"
	depends on A
config C
	bool "c"
	require B
CONFIG_A=m
Will C be visible?
The underlying problem is that we use bool for two different cases:
- non-modular driver (answer would be "no")
- enable feature in driver (answer would be "depends on the value of D")
