I understand the problem it caused. The MAD layer of InfiniBand was 
quite a bit behind and we wanted to catch up. I tried to make them in
smaller manageable pieces and that was why there were so many patches in
the series. In the future, I will endeavor to make the changes smaller.
Sorry for the problems this caused.
