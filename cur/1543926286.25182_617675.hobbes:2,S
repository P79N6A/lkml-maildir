Well you must mean something different by "strong typing" from the
rest of us.  Strong typing means that the compiler can check that you
have passed in the correct types of arguments, but the compiler
doesn't have any visibility into what structures are valid in netlink
messages.
In any case, I think that adding a structure size argument to the
current perfmon2 system calls where appropriate would mean that we
could extend them cleanly later on if necessary.  It would mean that
we could add fields at the end, and that the kernel could know what
version of the structures that userspace was using.
