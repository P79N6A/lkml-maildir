Well, genirq gives you more flexibility than the current mecanism so ...
If I understand correctly, you need to do scray stuff to figure out your
toplevel irq, which shound't be a problem with either mecanisms... 
Now, if you have funky cascades, then you can always group them into a
virtual irq cascade line and have a special chained flow handler that
does all the "figuring out" off those... it's up to you. 
In general, I found genirq allowed me to do more fancy stuff, and end up
with actually less hooks and indirect function calls on the path to a
given irq than before as you can use tailored flow handlers that do just
the right thing.
Ben.
