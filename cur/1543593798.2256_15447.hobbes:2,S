Paulo,
Thanks for the update/patch. Sorry I missed your first email, bu I've been
way too busy with other stuff the last couple of months.
There's a lot of endianess issues in the tlan driver, but none really
bothered fixing them. No one really assumed the tlan adapters would be used
on bigendian machines. Well, let me say, you're probaly the first ;-).
Now, I have pile of updates/issues for the tlan driver I need to check up
on. Hopefully I'll have some sparetime within a reasonable future to address
this.
BTW. The project page on compaq.com is the "new" tlan site.
Thanks,
Torben Mathiasen
