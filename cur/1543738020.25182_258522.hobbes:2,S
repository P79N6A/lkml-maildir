OK. Now it works fine. Thanks Ingo.
Maybe I'm just a plain idiot, but wouldn't it be welcome to add another
dot number or whatever to the VP filename label? IMHO that should clear
things of what actual patch release are we really applying.
The crash with jackd wasn't the only one, some other sound apps also failed
with similar kernel oopses dumps.
And, just out of curiosity, I've also tested "vanilla" 2.6.9-rc3-mm3 and
it looks like suffering from the same illness. So this has to be yet
another "feature" of the -mm line ;)
I'm glad this time VP came to the rescue :)
Take care.
