Copying here the comments I already made so Jeff gets them...

Why an ifdef here ? The cpu_to_le16 should probably be unconditional.
And even if for some weird reason you wanted to ifdef it, why PPC ? and
what about other BE architectures ?

You'll have to do better here too... I don't wee why when compiled on
PPC, this driver should "magically" not clear those bits... At the very
least, you should test the machine type if you want to do something
specific to your platform, but first, you'll have to convince Jeff why
this change has to be done in the first place and if there is a better
way to handle it.

Looks to me like the initial code was bogus, thus the #ifdef shouldn't
be necessary neither, and even if it was, an ifdef CONFIG_PPC would be
the wrong approach for what I think should be ovious enough reasons...
