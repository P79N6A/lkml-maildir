Here it is:
CPU1:                           CPU2
netlink_release():              netlink_dump_start():
                                sk = netlink_lookup(); /* OK */
netlink_remove();
spin_lock(&nlk->cb_lock);
if (nlk->cb) { /* false */
  ...
}
spin_unlock(&nlk->cb_lock);
                                spin_lock(&nlk->cb_lock);
                                if (nlk->cb) { /* false */
                                         ...
                                }
                                nlk->cb = cb;
                                spin_unlock(&nlk->cb_lock);
                                ...
sock_orphan(sk);
/*
 * proceed with releasing
 * the socket
 */
The proposal it to make sock_orphan before detaching the callback
in netlink_release() and to check for the sock to be SOCK_DEAD in
netlink_dump_start() before setting a new callback.
