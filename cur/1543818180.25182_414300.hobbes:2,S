Subject: [PATCH] Fix mode of checkstack.pl and other files.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/7/90

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
Make it executable like it should be. Do the same for other files intended to be
executed by the user - the ones called by the build process needn't be
executable as they already work (as argument to their interpreter).
