OK, I've done a bit of investigation. It turns out that as generates 
this warning when the following condition is met:
       if ((get & mask) != 0
	  && ((get & mask) != mask
	      || (get & hibit) == 0))
I've modified the warning to give me some more info about the values 
involved:
test.S: Assembler messages:
test.S:3: Warning: value 0xffffffff7fffffff truncated to 0x7fffffff, 
mask = ffffffff00000000, unmask = ffffffff, (get & mask) = 
ffffffff00000000), sizeof(get) = 8, sizeof(mask) = 8
This could be correct if as interpreted ~ as a 64-bit binary not, not a 
32-bit one. Not quite unlogical (it doesn't know the type of the input 
value -- it's a literal), except that it doesn't print the full value 
when it truncates it. I find it strange though that the warning isn't 
given for values under 0x80000000! This turns out to have to do with the 
"hibit", which turns out to be 0x80000000. Basically, their logic is 
that if (get & mask) == mask (all upper bits are 1) and (get & hibit) != 
0 as well, then the number is fits within a 32 bits *signed* integer. 
However, they don't look at the unsignedness of the value. So, I've 
changed this to:
       if ((get & mask) != 0
	  && (exp->X_unsigned
               || (get & mask) != mask
	      || (get & hibit) == 0))
Now it seems to behave correctly: for '~' it always warns, for '-' it 
only warns if the negative value is below -0x80000000. I'll submit a 
patch to this effect (including the format extensions) to the binutils 
people.
What's the effect of this for the linux warning? We don't want to use ~ 
for this, because it's not a 32-bit binary not. So, we need to use 
either my solution or the one supplied by Hans.
