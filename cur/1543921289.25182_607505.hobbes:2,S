The patch doesn't hurt AppArmor, but it's still a step in the wrong direction.
Quoting from commit 20510f2f (Convert LSM into a static interface):

This is idiotic. Just because there is no safe way to unload SELinux
 - doesn't mean there is no safe way to unload other LSMs: if nothing
   but that, unloading is handy during development.
 - doesn't mean that module *loading* is unsafe. The patch removes module
   loading as well, which hurts more than removing module unloading.
LSM can be abused ... so what, this doesn't mean the interface is bad. Non-LSM 
loadable modules have been known to do lots of bad things, and yet nobody 
made them non-loadable either (yet).

Non-trivial modules (i.e., practically everything beyond capabilities) become 
effective only after loading policy, anyway. If you can load policy, you can 
as well first load a security module without making the system insecure.
