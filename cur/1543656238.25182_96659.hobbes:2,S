There is no option in my bios to enable or disable L2 cache..
And at boot I get this
DSP Microcode OK ...... L2 512KB OK
AS#1 Microcode OK ...... L2 512KB OK
So I assume that the bios enable it, do there is a way to Force the kernel to use it even if he can't detect it ??
Thank you for your time and answer :)
