Why compare "write application or apply patches" to "load plugin"? It
would be locical to compare running applications with loading plugins (and
even so, loading plugins is presumably root-only).

Use an editor that knows about encrypted files. Decrypt/edit/encrypt if no
other option (I'm sure emacs can be coerced to do that transparently ;-). I
for one would be _way_ more confortable with my users doing that than them
loading random modules into the kernel. Besides, if one of my users doesn't
trust the system encryption programs, and prefers hers, she can be happy.

Modules of the kernel were supposed to have all those magic properties too,
until there were nasty races... and it was _seriously_ considered to take
them out. They stayed because they are root-only business, and (un)loading
is rare. FS plugins are kernel modules, AFAIU, and are subject to the same
problems.

If you can't find concrete uses for specific plugins, they are the
proverbial solution searching for a problem.
