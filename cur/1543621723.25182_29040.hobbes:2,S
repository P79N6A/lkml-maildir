What worked for me (see later), is moving the newer module and
appropriate includes across to the older kernel and performing a make
modules && make modules_install. 
<long version>
This worked for me when using a patched nm256_audio and ac97 module to
get my sound working. I couldn't get the patch to apply properly to the
whole kernel, so I nicked those files I knew were needed and moved them
over to a clean kernel. hope this helps, and yeh, I've got no idea if
this will work for you. I would first try copying the 8139too.c from
drivers/net to the 2.4.9 kernel, and if you've already setup your config
you should just be able to make modules and then insmod (with luck).
