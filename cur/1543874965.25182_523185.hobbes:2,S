What about instead adding support for fractions (IE: "1/1000") in / 
proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio?  If the denominator is 100, the default,  
then it prints in the form "$NUMERATOR", otherwise it prints answers  
of the form "$NUMERATOR/$DENOMINATOR".  Input could be of either  
form, with the kernel auto-setting the denominator to 100 if none is  
specified.
