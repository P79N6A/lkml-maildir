O.K. I will add the additional / to all shm pathes internally.
I do not like the path //shm since it clutters the root dircetory
further.
I tried to extract he path in my first version, but did not like the
hack needed for this. Since the information is not known to
read_super, you always need a hack to extract the name. Thus I fell
back to the old principle 'keep it small an stupid^H^H^H^H^Himple'
