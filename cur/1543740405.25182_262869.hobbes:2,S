Here is some old shell-code I wrote for my kernel updating script: It
was especially written because you tend to forget this.
test_version () {
    # Sometimes Alan forgets to update the EXTRAVERSION in the Makefile;
    # then you destroy the previous version and the script fails :S
    cd $pwd/linux-$latest_stable
    # if EXTRAVERSION is for mm but not the current one.
    if [ -z "$(grep "EXTRAVERSION = -$mm_rest" Makefile)" \
        -a -z "$(grep "EXTRAVERSION = .*mm" Makefile)" ]; then
        warning 'Warning: I had to edit the versionnumber in the Makefile!'
        grep "EXTRAVERSION =" Makefile
        perl -pi -e "s#^EXTRAVERSION.*\n#EXTRAVERSION = -$mm_rest\n#" \
            Makefile || error
        grep "EXTRAVERSION =" Makefile
    fi
}

I think it is a better idea you add some checks to the script you use to
generate that patch.
