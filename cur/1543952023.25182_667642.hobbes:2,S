Netlink is a messaging protocol, synchronization is up to the user.
I suggest that you send a netlink notification to a multicast group for
every expire candiate when an expire request is received. Unmount
daemons simply subscribe to the group and wait for work to do. Put the
request onto a list including the netlink pid and sequence number so you
can address the orignal source of the request later on. Exit the netlink
receive function and wait for the userspace daemon to get back to you.
The userspace daemon notifies you of successful or unsuccesful unmount
attempts by sending notifications. Update your list entry accordingly
and once the request is fullfilled send a notification to the original
source of the request by using the stored pid and sequence number.
The userspace application requesting the expire can simply block on the
receival of this notification in order to make the whole operation
synchronous.
Sounds acceptable?
