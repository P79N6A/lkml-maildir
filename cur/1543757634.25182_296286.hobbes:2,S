Something like this is needed, also for unusual cases.  gcc sometimes
decides to switch "sub 16" with "add -16".  Later, when the stack
frame is popped back, the exchange goes vice versa.
Without this code, you'd see a few cases of nearly 4GiB.

Changing 0x8000_0000 to 0xf000_0000 would work for the add case as
well.  Sounds like a sane change.
Checkstack could also do the ignoring for you, maybe like this:
	if ($size > 0xf0000000) {
		$size = - $size;
		$size += 0x80000000;
		$size += 0x80000000;
	}
	if ($size > 0x10000000) {
		$size = 0;
	}
