I'm not sure how this ended up in the x86 tree
(
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/x86_64/quilt/patches/add-common-orderly_poweroff
),
but recent changes in arch/sparc64/kernel/power.c have broken it.
Dave, those changes hit mainline without ever having appeared in the
sparc-2.6.git tree, afaict.  If they _had_ appeared there I'd have been
able to tell you that there wasn't any point in changing code which we're
planning on deleting.  Otoh,
    [SPARC64]: Export powerd facilities for external entities.
    Besides the existing usage for power-button interrupts, we'll
    want to make use of this code for domain-services where the
    LDOM manager can send reboot requests to the guest node.
make me think that this code isn't deleteable any more.
Ho hum, I will delete the sparc64 hunk and shall hope for the best.  Mainly
to avoid downstream rejects - I suspect this patch needs revisting now.
Andi, your tree is looking pretty stale - I hope it will be updated soon?
