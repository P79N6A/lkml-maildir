When I attempt to compile 2.6.11.12 from a full download. I get the 
following messages:
include/linux/i2c.h:58: error: array type has incomplete element type
include/linux/i2c.h:197: error: array type has incomplete element type
I think the problem has to do with the forward declartion used in those 
lines. 
I am using gcc 4.0 on FC4 final
