As long as that also means no "silly _mV" in the name.  However, if the
choice is between :mV and _mV, please go with :mV.

Well, "Wh" measures energy and not power, and "Ah" measures electric charge
and not current, so it would be better to make that:
capacity_*_energy  (Wh-based)
and
capacity_*_charge  (Ah-based)
Also, should we go with mWh/mAh, or with even smaller units because of the
tiny battery-driven devices of tomorrow?
