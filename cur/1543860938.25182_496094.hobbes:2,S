You are right. They don't depend on each other. 
The intention behind introducing CPU_LOCK_ACQUIRE and CPU_LOCK_RELEASE
was to have a standard place where the subsystems could acquire/release
the "cpu hotplug protection" mutex in the cpu_hotplug callback function.
The same can be acheived by acquiring these mutexes in
CPU_UP_PREPARE/CPU_DOWN_PREPARE etc. 
This is true for every subsystem that is cpu-hotplug aware.
