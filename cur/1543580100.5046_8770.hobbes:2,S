Subject: [PATCH] ipt_TOS fix.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus, please apply v2.4.0.
ipt_TOS checksum calculations were completely broken, causing bad csum
packets.  Whoever implemented it didn't understand the code it was
copied from.
This fixes the problem (tested in userspace against all TOS changes).
Rusty.
