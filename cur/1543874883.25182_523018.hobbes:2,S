That's right. The only place it's used atm is to log the pid of
processes that are triggering mounts.

btw please don't be confused by my use of "user space application". In
my comments I'm talking about applications that are similar in function
to autofs itself and not processes that might trigger mounts. For
example the "autodir" package uses the autofs filesystem to provide
dynamic home directory creation. The point being that we can't know what
an application may do with the info in a request packet so we need to be
sure we cover all the cases.
