Colin reported off-line that he's using 2.6.9
rather than 2.6.10-rc2 or newer ... so it's
actually expected that his kernel misbehave
with USB PM.  The workaround, for all 2.6
kernels until very recently, is to rmmod the
HCDs before entering a system sleep state.
I think that starting in 2.6.10 it'll be OK
to leave the USB HCDs loaded during various
PM sleep states ... in at least some common
system configuration.  There are several
hundred different possibilities, it's hard
to test all of them even if you do happen to
have all that hardware!
But for earlier kernels, don't even try that.
