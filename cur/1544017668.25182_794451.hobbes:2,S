When working around this compiler bug would it be better to do it like this:
+     return get_new_cred((struct cred *)(void *)cred);
instead of relying on the size of a pointer and using an large enough
integer data type?
Maybe would should just add a comment, to note that if such a warning
is issued, that
this is a compiler bug.
Or disable the warning for this region, but as far as I know gcc _does
not_ have this feature yet.
