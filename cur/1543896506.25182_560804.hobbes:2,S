No, it does not break POSIX.
Unless, of course, there's a bug in the policy or in the program. Bugs
are generally not covered by POSIX, for some strange reason.
(The argument that POSIX codifies implementation bugs in Unix(tm)
implementations of the time non-withstanding.)

That is an implementation bug though. I'm sure we have other bugs in the
kernel too - this isn't a design flaw. 
(If people are allowed to thinair solutions for implementing AA on top
of SELinux, I can thinair that this can be solved by reverse-matching
the dentry tree against the policy as the path is traversed and
constructed, requiring a constant sized buffer.)
