Is there any chance you can send a testcase my way? I've got some
testboxen that are good at bringing out races (NUMA stuff is beautiful
for that -- I don't consider anything racetested until it passes there.)
No guarantees, of course, but I do like to make my testing services
available when I can. Recently it helped with some of kai's makefiles.
Thanks,
Bill
