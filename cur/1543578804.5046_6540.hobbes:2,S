That will not work. Consider an application that has multiple rtnetlink
sockets open, which each have own errors.
rtnetlink is such a radical interface for unix, adding a few more changes
for a different error reporting system probably does not make much difference.
my problem with keeping the textual error messages out of kernel is that
it means that three entities (kernel module, number table in kernel and 
external string table) need to be kept in sync. In practice that's usually
not the case.
David's /proc/errno_strings would only require keeping kernel table and
module in sync. 
Text errors for rtnetlink would localize it to the module itself. 
I could probably live with David's solution, although I would prefer the full
way.
