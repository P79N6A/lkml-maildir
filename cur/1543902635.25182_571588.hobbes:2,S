Seems to be more of an SCC unit allocation library, but OK.
I've also forwarded a copy of the patch to Frank Mandarino
<fmandarino@endrelia.com> for his comments.  He maintains the current
AT91 SSC & ALSA support.  <sound/soc/at91/>

I'm personally not a fan of the register & bit definition format the
AVR32 driver seem to use.
Can we not rather move the existing include/asm-arm/arch-at91/at91_ssc.h
to somewhere shared as atmel_ssc.h ?
