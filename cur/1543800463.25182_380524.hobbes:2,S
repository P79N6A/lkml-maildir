Hi,
we still think that there is a problem in bttv_risc_packed in computing
estimated size. My patch was bad, I see it now, but still don't understand, how
it is computed and how it should be:
        instructions  = (bpl * lines) / PAGE_SIZE + lines;
        instructions += 2;
and here it crashes (the first line, the (*rp)) -- actually after while loop.
	*(rp++)=cpu_to_le32(BT848_RISC_WRITE|BT848_RISC_EOL|todo);
	*(rp++)=cpu_to_le32(sg_dma_address(sg));
So, Mauro (or somebody from list), have you any idea, what could be wrong?  
thanks,
