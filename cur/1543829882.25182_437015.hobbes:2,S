The permissions info within a tarball doesn't mean anything as long as
the file just sits there.  Only when you interpret the contents and
create files and directories they become relevant.
Tar gives you two options: A) set permissions exactly as stored in the
tar file, or B) apply the umask.  Tar archives created by git are
intended to be interpreted using option B), which is the default for GNU
tar if run as non-root.
You can interpret the tar file correctly even if you are root, you just
have to convince tar to apply the umask.
Best regards,
