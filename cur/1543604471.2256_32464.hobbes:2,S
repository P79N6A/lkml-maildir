Maybe we're giving out too much information? To put it bluntly, if
people are told what we're up to, they'll doctor the bug reports.
People are selfish and will try to game the system. I'm not even sure
if we should expose the term "tainted" in the first place. Maybe a
"compatibility bitmask" with a hex value should be reported instead.
Alan: you're the instigator of this scheme. How widely do you want to
publish what this is really about? I note that lwn.net had a paragraph
on the tainting scheme.
