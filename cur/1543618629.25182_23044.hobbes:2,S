 it may be useful if Randy can throw a real world test
 into the benchmarking, to get a better comparison of
 the various systems. The obvious one that springs to mind
 would be something like compilation of a large source tree
 kernel/mozilla/etc..  (same version, same config options
 every time). Though, as compilation is largely compute bound,
 instead of IO bound, the more small files that need to be
 read/generated the better.
 Or maybe timing an updatedb. Its realworld enough in that its
 a daily task, generates lots of IO..
