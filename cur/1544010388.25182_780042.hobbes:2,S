Fine for ARM - and yes, the user visible API should be changed from the
BSD standard.  I don't think anyone in this thread was suggesting that
the user visible argument ordering should be any different from the
original.
Having it in a different order from *BSD at the libc visible interface
is just crazy from the OS portability point of view.
