I seem to be playing sound just fine on my rev6 1371 :)
From /proc/pci:
  Bus  0, device   6, function  0:
    Multimedia audio controller: Ensoniq ES1371 (rev 6).
      IRQ 15.
      Master Capable.  Latency=80.  Min Gnt=12.Max Lat=128.
      I/O at 0xe400 [0xe43f].
And yes, I'm using the standard OSS driver as included with
the kernel...
