Each individual test run executes the test for 20 processes, then 40,
then 60, 80, and finally 100 processes.  Each set of processes are 
executed 5 times, and an average time to complete the exercise is
given for each of the sets.  The test report (shown by the link) has
a graph of the averaged times for each of the sets.  In all cases, 
there is a very good linear correlation as the number of processes
increase.  The results for the previous email showd only the times
for the 100 process set.  
As you look again and compare the times against the 1-way, 2-way, 4-way
and 8-way systems, you see the times decrease as the number of
processors in a system increase.  This is also a good trend.  And it
seems to be a fairly good linear correlation as well, implying that
the scheduler has done a good job at scaling between processes within
one system increase, and a good job at scaling as the number of
processors increase. 
As stated in the reply above, as the kernel is evolving, continual 
improvements are being made to the scheduler, as shown by the decrease
in average times for the run of 100 set of processes with each
subsequent release of the kernel.
