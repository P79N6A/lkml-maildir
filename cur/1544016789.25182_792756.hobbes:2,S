btw., i think spin-mutexes have a design advantage here: in a lot of code 
areas it's quite difficult to use spinlocks - cannot allocate memory, 
cannot call any code that can sporadically block (but does not _normally_ 
block), etc.
With mutexes those atomicity constraints go away - and the performance 
profile should now be quite close to that of spinlocks as well.
