True. I must have had an old version of workqueue.c in mind ... which
had a warning of that sort; I didn't realise that had been fixed.
Now that we have included the patch to splice the AIO runlist, 
newer requests getting queued up on the ioctx shouldn't livelock us. 
So yes this isn't strictly necessary. We still have one ioctx cancellation
waiting for ongoing retries on other ioctx's system wide to get done,
instead of just the io context being cancelled, but that's probably
not so bad. We can wait till that shows up as a real problem.
