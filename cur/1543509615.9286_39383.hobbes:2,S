Check the readme in

for complete details and disclaimers.
Setting up a ext3 is straightforward. partial extraction:
...
Now, you want to make a journaled filesystem (recommended) or journal an
existing one (for the exceptionally stupid/brave).  Great.  Go right
ahead, make a new ext2 filesystem if you need to, and mount the
filesystem you want to journal.
Be aware that the jfs patch does _not_ change the ext2 code.  Rather, it
makes a copy of ext2 called ext3, and all the fancy footwork takes place
in that.  You don't have to run ext3 on all your valuable filesystems:
just use it on the throwaway ones.
Now, create a journal file.  I don't know how big it should be yet: the
rules of thumb have yet to be established!  However, try (say) 2MB for a
small filesystem on a 486; maybe up to 30MB on a bit 18G 10krpm
Cheetah.  Or whatever you want.  You'll need to make sure that the file
is preallocated, so use something like:
        dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/sparefs/journal.dat bs=1k count=10000
assuming you want a 10MB journal on a 1k ext2 filesystem mounted on
/mnt/sparefs.  You need to find the journal inode's inode number, too:
        ls -i /mnt/sparefs/journal.dat
For a newly created filesystem, this will probably show
        12 journal.dat
OK, 12 is the expected number for a clean fs.
Now, umount as ext2.  Take a deep breath.  Now mount as ext3, giving it
the inode number of the file to be mounted as a journal:
        mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb2 /mnt/sparefs -o journal=12
Bingo.  That's it.  Enjoy!
