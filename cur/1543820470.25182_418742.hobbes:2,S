Yes, it sounds reasonable. Then, at least, the user space Apps can
rely on a single interface, and don't need to know the implementation  
details for the common input event. That will save a lot of support
effort.

ok.

I'm NOT sure if it is reasonable to propagate other ACPI events 
through input layer.  But from my understanding, Laptop with ACPI
features 
should be the super class of PDA. It would be nice to have input layer
handle all ACPI events. Then, we can enjoy the advantage of a single 
input interface for user Apps.
