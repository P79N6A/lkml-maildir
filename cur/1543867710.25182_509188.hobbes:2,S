Generic pointer still reads 'void*' isn't it? If you don't believe me,
check memcpu() and friends. From the POV of aliasing rules, "char*",
"unsigned char*", and "signed char*" are all the same, as aliasing rules
mention "character type", that according to the standard, is defined
like this:
  "The three types char, signed char, and unsigned char are collectively
   called the character types."

Are the first two different other than by 0-termination? If not, then
differentiate 1 and 2 by signedness doesn't make sense. If we throw
away signedness argument, then yes, 2 is more common than 1, due to
obvious reason that it's much more convenient to use 0-terminated arrays
of characters in C than plain arrays of characters.
For 3, I'd use "unsigned char*" (or, sometimes, maybe, "signed char*") to
do actual access (due to aliasing rules), but "void*" as an argument
type, as arbitrary pointer is spelled "void*" in C.
So, it's 2 that I'd consider the most common usage for "char*". Strings
of characters are idiomatically "char*" in C.

As a result of what? Of the fact that strings in C are "char*"? Of the
fact that one can use "char*" to access arbitrary memory? If the latter,
then "char*", "signed char*", and "unsigned char*" are all equal, and
you may well argue that there should be no warning between "signed
char*" and "unsigned char*" as well, as either of them could be used to
access memory.
Anyway, I've already stated that I don't think it's signedness that matters
here. Standard explicitly says "char", "signed char", and "unsigned
char" are all distinct types, so the warning should be about
incompatible pointer instead. Anyway, I even don't dispute those 99.99%
number, I just want somebody to explain me how dangerous those 0.001%
are, and isn't it exactly 0%?

Only from the point of view of aliasing. Aliasing rules don't disallow
other surprises.

Why do you think it's impossible according to the draft?

I doubt it's impossible either in the draft or in the final version.

IMHO, it would read "I want a pointer to alphabetic characters, and I'm
probably going to use them as alphabetic characters, so beware". No
signedness involved.
For example, suppose we have 3 function that compare two
zero-terminated arrays:
int compare1(char *c1, char *c2);
int compare2(unsigned char *c1, unsigned char *c2);
int compare3(signed char *c1, signed char *c2);
the first one might compare arguments alphabetically, while the second
and the third compare them numerically. All of the 3 are different, so
passing wrong type of argument to either of them might be dangerous.

I'm afraid that those times when it actually was, are far in the past,
for better or worse.

IMHO, you've forgot to say "of alphabetic characters".

Those are for signed and unsigned tiny integers, with confusing names,
that in turn are just historical baggage.

How is it relevant? According to this argument, e.g., foo(int*) can't
actually rely on the sign of its argument, so any warning about
signedness of pointer argument is crap.

It's legal to pass "unsigned int*" to function requesting "int*", still
the warning on this is useful?

Yes, it's special, but in what manner? I fail to see in the standard
that "char" means either of "signed char" or "unsigned char".

The isxxx() family doesn't have pointer arguments, so this is
irrelevant. The isxxx() family, as implemented in the kernel, casts its
argument to "unsigned char", that is the right thing to do.

Well, maybe, but it won't be C anymore. Strings in C are "char*", and
sign of "char" is implementation-defined. Though you can get what you
are asking for even now by using -funsigned-char.

Yes, how did I forgot about it? So be it, strings in C are "char*".

Any compiler is stupid. AI didn't mature enough yet ;)

Well, on one hand you are asking for char to always be unsigned, but on
the other hand you deny the gcc option that provides exactly that. The
only option that remains is to argue char should always be unsigned to
the C committee, I'm afraid.
