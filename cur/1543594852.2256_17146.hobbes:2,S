Bad example Larry, most of us do our talks with MagicPoint.  I'll probably 
use KPresenter for the next one, it's pretty slick.
I haven't booted Window in almost 2 years, not because I'm forcing myself to 
stay away, but because I haven't had the need.  And yes, I do word 
processing, make spreadsheets, charts, send emails, you name it.
