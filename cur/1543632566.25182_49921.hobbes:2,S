That simplification is appreciated, but I think that
   make -f Makefile-2.5 bzImage
should still be allowed, call it compatibility glue if you like.
For what it's worth, I find it quite natural to have the build
information in the .config and I was able to find my way to it
without reading the docs.  Still - when Makefile-2.5 becomes just
plain Makefile, a lot of fingers are still going to want to type
"make bzImage".
