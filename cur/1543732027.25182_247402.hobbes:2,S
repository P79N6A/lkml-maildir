The SCSI disk driver has been doing a single retry for quite some time
and it hasn't really bitten people. Why would the IDE disk driver be
different? The only case I can imagine a retry would be OK, is when we
get an UDMA CRC error (caused by bad cables).
(OK, for SCSI drives you have a lot more control about how a drive
should treat errors, but the kernel will not retry a block when the
drive reported it's bad.)
