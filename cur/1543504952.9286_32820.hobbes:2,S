I just want to clarify something for myself. I have a bunch of dual
processor machines. Any one process can occupy only one CPU (the kernel
does not use two cpus to double the speed...I suppose for a good reason,
as parallizing would be difficult). However, the usage of the cpu's
switches back and forth between them. CPU#0 is 100% one second and then 0%
another, while CPU#1 picks up the task. Why is this shuffling?
Thanks,
mk
