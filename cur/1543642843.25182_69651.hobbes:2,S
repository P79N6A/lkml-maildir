Since the RFCs *demand* that an address mentioned in mail has an MX  
record, and the fallback to A records was not, until recently, described,  
there probably are some mailers that cannot deliver mail to that address.  
Which, in my book, counts as "not perfectly fine", even though I admit  
those mailers are probably in a minority as, sadly, this particular  
disease is pretty widespread.
Still. I personally count it as a bug just the same as using an implicit  
extern to call a function.
