cd /usr/src/redhat
rpm --install kernel*src*rpm
more SPECS/kernel*
Gives a change log, a list of patches , and the patch files are all dropped
into the SOURCES directory. rpm -ba applies and builds the rpms
AFAIK there are five patches not in the mainstream kernel nowdays
o	An earlier version of HJ Lu's NFS patch
o	A version of Doug's AIC7xxx driver  (may be in) - newer and even better
	one is in 2.2.11pre2
o	Ingo's raid update (newer and better one in 11pre2)
o	Large file handle patch (which I hope will get in once its had all the
	Linus thinks xyz is ugly bits removed).
o	Drop the kernel into /boot by default
