I don't actually think dual licensing is necessary, since the new 
BSD/MIT license is generally considered to be GPL-compatible (i.e. it 
grants all the rights the GPL does.)  The dual license concept dates 
back to the "old BSD" license, which definitely was *not* GPL-compatible.

This is pretty much it, except I believe explicit dual licensing is 
superfluous.  If anyone has evidence to the contrary please let me know.
