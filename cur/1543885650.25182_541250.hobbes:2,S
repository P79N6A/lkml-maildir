Re: [PATCH 0/2] LogFS take two
You seem to be missing the immutable bit. This is really useful
for dealing with buggy or badly-designed things running as root.
I've used to to protect /dev/null from becoming a normal file
filled with junk, and to protect /etc/resolv.conf from "helpful"
network management daemons that don't know my DNS servers.
Anything else missing?
BTW, BSD offers an unprivileged immutable bit as well. I'm sure
it's useful for the apps that trash their own config files.
Actually, this bit alone would do fine, and we could really use
a way to protect writable device files from deletion or permission
bit changes.
