You mean wakeup_secondary_via_INIT, called by do_boot_cpu?
That is too late. sched_init happens much earlier, and the per-cpu offset
table for all AP cpus not present is referenced, and I hit an early exception.
sched_init is executed on the BP very early and sched_init does this:
        for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; i++) {
                prio_array_t *array;
                rq = cpu_rq(i); 
The cpu_rq macro ends up needing per-cpu offset table stored in cpu_pda of
the AP cpus, even before we hit the code to send startup IPIs.
(#define __per_cpu_offset(cpu) (cpu_pda[cpu].data_offset))
This is way before slab is ready.  So I either use alloc_bootmem before
sched_init in setup_arch, or keep the static boot_cpu_pda.
Am I missing something?
Thanks,
Kiran
