i should put a /etc/resolv.conf.... but i dont want, for "dark reasons" ;)
if i have a /etc/resolv.conf, what's the point in querying the dhcp 
server for a nameserver???
i thought this would set linux a nameserver in case no /etc/resolv.conf 
was find.
btw, i can't dhclient has i'm nfs-rooting. doing this breaks my 
connection with the nfs server and i lose / !!!!!
i'm working on it.
thanks anyway
