Hmmm, that seems to have several serious disadvantages:
- it's not filesystem/user-space SW independent (requires modifying them - as far as I understand how it's done)
- needs to "touch" all existing files/dirs (maybe I'm wrong but from very first look it seems to me that I need to setup "cow" flag on each file/dir I want to "cow") - my approach should be "atomic" even when I need to setup snapshot on directory containing 100s thousands of files/dirs (and that's an average server I'm thinking of!)
Nevertheless - thanks for a tip.
