Hello again,
Since this is my first Linux patch, I'm not sure
if what it does is OK, or even possible (but it
works for me).
As this is kind of a specialist thing (FireWire
on Apple laptops with Linux) I decided to put the
patch on a web page:
http://anrp.irulethe.net/powerbook-ieee1394.html
Anyone with this setup (Apple Pbook + firewire)
please test this patch.
Thanks,
Andrew Patrikalakis
