    I've got a motherboad with an MVP4 chipset.  This chipset has integrated
video and sound.  Its suppose to have backward Soundblaster compatability
however sound still doesn't work.  I was wondering if anybody was working on
a sound driver for this integrated sound in this chipset.  If not I might
write one myself.
