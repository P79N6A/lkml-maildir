XPMEM is doing this by putting our equivalent structure of the mm into a
recalling state which will cause all future faulters to back off, it then
marks any currently active faults in the range as invalid (we have a very
small number of possible concurrent faulters for a different reason),
proceeds to start remote shoot-downs, waits for those shoot-downs to
complete, then returns from the _begin callout with the mm-equiv still in
the recalling state.  Additional recalls may occur, but no new faults can.
The _end callout reduces the number of active recalls until there are
none left at which point the faulters are allowed to proceed again.
