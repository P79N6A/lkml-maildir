I think that this is the wrong approach.  genrtc allows the platform to
specify how the rtc is to be accessed.  Therefore, efirtc.c could quite
probably be removed in favor of genrtc.c, if the proper read/write
functions are provided, and if genrtc gets alarm code, which is
something others (rmk at least) have asked for.
