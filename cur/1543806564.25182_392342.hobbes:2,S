What I am talking about is when you want a task to have the highest
possible scheduling priority and you'd like to guarantee that it is
not interrupted for more than Xus, including scheduling latency.
Presumably this is your classic RT control type application.
Now in your kernel you can measure a single long interrupt time, but
if you "break" that latency by splitting it into two interrupts, the
end result will be the same if not worse due to decreased efficiency.
This is what I was talking about. But that's going off topic...

Then it is a fine hack for the RT kernel (or at least an improved,
batched version of the patch). No arguments from me.
