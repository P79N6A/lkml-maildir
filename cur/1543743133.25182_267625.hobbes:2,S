With -V0.6.9, I got some slightly different symptoms. I did the change
chrt change (though I looked up the PID by hand, my attempt to use
pidof with 'ksoftirqd/0' did not work).
The LOC count did increase on both CPU's during my test (up until
I got the deadlock listed below). I also noticed that almost all
interrupts were processed by CPU0; should have checked before starting
the real time test to see if that was consistent when the system
was idle. I was about to send you a message from the test system with
that data when the system locked up.
The crash sequence was...
 - boot to single user (uneventful)
 - telnet 5 (uneventful)
 - X and top tests (uneventful)
 - network test started (and did not finish)
 - 2343 usec latency dumped
 - 55962 usec latency dumped
 - 74229 usec latency dumped
 - 83374 usec latency dumped
 - deadlock
 - long string of other BUG messages
I tried to Sync & reboot with Alt-SysRq keys at this point and was
unable to do so. Hard reset to reboot. Serial console output to
follow separately.
