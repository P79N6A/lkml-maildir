Oops!  Good catch.,.. I've moved the kunmap to before the timeout...

We don't need to set to -1 if we never slept, that's why we have the
woken flag.

case 0 does not return, it sleeps!  This is wrong...

Look closer at __futex_down: it doesn't decrement if futx->count < 0.

Yes, this is what the PPC code does.
