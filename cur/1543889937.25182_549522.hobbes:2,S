I suspect that kconf is not properly handing the newer way for
menuconfig. Maybe this is the same stuff that happened on ALSA.
We have some stuff like this:
menuconfig VIDEO_CAPTURE_DRIVERS
        bool "Video capture adapters"
        depends on VIDEO_DEV
if VIDEO_CAPTURE_DRIVERS
config VIDEO_VIVI
        tristate "Virtual Video Driver"
        depends on VIDEO_V4L2 && !SPARC32 && !SPARC64 && PCI
        select VIDEO_BUF
endif #VIDEO_CAPTURE_DRIVERS
config VIDEO_BUF
        depends on PCI
        tristate
Before adding menuconfig, VIDEO_VIVI were dependent on VIDEO_DEV. After
the patch, what happens is that:
if 
	VIDEO_DEV='m' and VIDEO_CAPTURE_DRIVERS='y' and VIDEO_VIVI='m'
then
	VIDEO_BUF='y'
But, as video-buf is dependent on video-core (compiled as a module,
since VIDEO_DEV='m'), it is generating compilation errors.
To fix it, I needed to add an explicit dependency on VIDEO_VIVI (and
also on VIDEO_SAA7146_VV):
http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb?cmd=changeset;node=5cd49ffd9004;style=gitweb
I didn't looked inside kconf, but it seems that it is not checking that,
as VIDEO_CAPTURE_DRIVERS depends on VIDEO_DEV, all drivers inside the
"if" should also depend on VIDEO_DEV.
Cheers,
Mauro
