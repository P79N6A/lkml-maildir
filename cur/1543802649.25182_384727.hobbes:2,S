well, _while_ starting portmap. As you can see from the traces I have
portmap sleeping in sys_poll, consider my reflexes are not that fast
so the trace might be well more than 10 secs after the /etc/init.d/portmap
was run.
Trying to stop and start it again didn't have any delay.

ooooh :) really really thanks!!
I was starting to script something that just some hours later revealed to
be like stGit (well at least had the same base idea).
Anyway I'm currently using -git7 and building -mm3, -git7 is OK:
no stalls, no reiser3 oops (yet) and no ACPI misaligned pointer.
Will report on -mm3 as soon as possible
