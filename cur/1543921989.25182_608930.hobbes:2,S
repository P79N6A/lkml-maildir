I looked at slab and slub, and would grow the buffer by no less than
1.5x each time, thanks to the buckets.  I'd initially implemented 2x,
but switched to allocating size+1 and calling ksize() as being a more
efficient implementation.
I presume slob is different?  Actually, slob doesn't seem to
provide krealloc, so I think stringbuf won't work on slob.  Will you
have time to fix this?

Hrm.
extern void sb_printf(struct stringbuf *sb, gfp_t gfp, const char *fmt, ...)
        __attribute__((format(printf, 3, 4)));
?  Any objections?

I don't care.  Sure!
