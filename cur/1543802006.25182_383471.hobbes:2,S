but... there seems to be a race now:

+               if (unlikely(atomic_read(&amd76x_stat.num_idle)
+                                       == num_online)) {
+                       /* Invoke C2 */
+                       prs->C2_cnt++;
+                       inb(amd76x_pm_cfg.C2_reg);
+                       break;
+               }
also.. atomic_t + manual interrupt disabling isn't by definition better
than a spinlock... when people say "spinlocks are expensive" they imply
that atomics are also expensive...
