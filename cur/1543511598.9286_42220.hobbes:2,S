Why? It takes 16KB (it can be slightly compressed), eg. NLS translation
tables waste 768 bytes each (probably more) and they are in the kernel.
Inode structure takes more than 256 bytes (because ext2 private fields
are so big without reason)...
Nobody will use unicode on low-end i386 router because it's usable
only on workstation anyway. Workstations have 16MB at least so it takes
1/1000 unswapable memory at most. Memory cost is not importand.

Why on framebuffer unicode is ok, but on VGA isn't?
(BTW: Who uses "direct to font"?)
