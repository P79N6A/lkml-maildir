Subject: [patch 07/12] powerpc: Fix size check for hugetlbfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Benjamin Herrenschmidt <benh@kernel.crashing.org>
My "slices" address space management code that was added in 2.6.22
implementation of get_unmapped_area() doesn't properly check that the
size is a multiple of the requested page size. This allows userland to
create VMAs that aren't a multiple of the huge page size with hugetlbfs
(since hugetlbfs entirely relies on get_unmapped_area() to do that
checking) which leads to a kernel BUG() when such areas are torn down.
