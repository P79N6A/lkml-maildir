Subject: [PATCH] (revised) fix net/irda warnings for 2.4.21-pre3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/1/11/59

The patch I announced several hours ago had issues. I have replaced the 
file on the website with a correct version. If anyone had already 
downloaded the fix, please do so again.
This fixes the numerous "Concatenation of string literals with 
__FUNCTION__ is depricated" errors in net/irda. This should apply 
cleanly to both a 2.4.21-pre3 and a 2.4.21-pre3-ac3 tree.
GCC 3+ users, please inform me if this patch works for you, so it can be 
submitted.
Thanks,
Tony Vroon.
