Subject: bcm43xx regression in 2.6.24 (with patch)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello.
The bcm43xx driver won't work any more, if the b44 Ethernet
driver is enabled. This happens because the b44 driver
needlessly enables the b43_pci_bridge code, which claims
the same pci ids as the bcm43xx driver. The b43_pci_bridge
code is needed for the b43{legacy} drivers, but for the
b44, only the "ssb pci core" is needed.
This patch separates the ssb b43 pci bridge and the ssb pci
core config options and enables only the needed ones.
Greg, how do you think, should this do a -stable material?
If the line number limit really matters, I could remove the
comments in the b43{legacy} Kconfigs. ;)
PS:
Yes, the bcm43xx driver is deprecated, but the b43 driver did
not work for me right out of the box (firmware updated).
Please don't remove the bc43xx driver until there are really no
problems with the new one.
I'll try the new driver once again this weekend, and will send
a bug report when I'll be sure it is not a stupid mistake.

Use a separate config option for the b43 pci to ssb bridge.
        The bridge code was unnecessary enabled by the b44
        driver, but it prevents the bcm43xx driver from
        being loaded, as the bridge claims the same pci ids.
        Now we enable the birdge only if the b43{legacy}
        drivers are selected.
