The wire protocols are similar, nothing fancy. The specificity of 
Quadrics (and many others) is that they can change the behavior of the 
NIC in firmware, so they adapt to what the OS offers. They had the VM 
notifier support in Tru64 back in the days, they just ported the 
functionality to Linux.

Swapping to disk is not a normal operations in HPC, it's going to be 
slow anyway. The main problem for HPC users is not swapping, it's that 
they do not know when a registered page is released to the OS through 
free(), sbrk() or munmap(). Like swapping, they don't expect that it 
will happen often, but they have to handle it gracefully.
