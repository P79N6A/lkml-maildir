Strange you should mention this... I used to work at Acorn with
the guy who did this (Mark Taunton). RISCiX was too early to be 4.3, I
think it was 4.1, but may have been 4.2, certainly no later, this was
1989.

They only needed to compress the fs on the R140 (an ARM 2 based
machine).  The better R260 had a bigger disk, and so didn't need the
compression. Interestingly, because of the slow disk I/O, compression
made the filesystem access faster.
I had an R140, and space was so tight in the filesystem, you had
to delete part of the distribution before you could even compile
a program!
