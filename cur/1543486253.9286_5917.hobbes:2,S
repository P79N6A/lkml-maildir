So send to a multicast address -- that has a couple of advantages:
- no need to be root,
- different syslog domains on a network are possible,
- given a multicast capable router, you can forward the messages to
  different subnets.
Hacking syslog and syslogd to actually do this is left as an exercise. ;-)
