Can you be more explicit in what you are looking for?
If you click on 'prepatch', 'snapshot', '-ac patch', and '-mm patch',
you can read some explanations.  What is missing there?
It looks to me like the word "stable" is overused on the main page
at www.kernel.org .  I would also prefer to see all of the 2.6.*
kernel versions together, above the 2.4.*, 2.2.*, and 2.0.* lines.
E.g. (however, this is too cluttered IMO; the prepatch/-ac/-mm
links do this well without the clutter):
The latest stable version of the Linux kernel is:  	2.6.11.11
The stable kernel patchset contains only critical and security patches
to the latest 2.6.x kernel.
The latest prepatch for the stable Linux kernel tree is:  	2.6.12-rc5
This is the mainline kernel where all new patches are added.
If they are not critical, they usually go thru the -mm patchset
before being merged here.  If they are critical, they may be
merged here first.
The latest -mm patch to the stable Linux kernels is:  	2.6.12-rc5-mm1 	
This is the development tree for 2.6 kernels.  Patches are
generally merged here for testing before being merged into
the mainline kernel tree.
The latest -ac patch to the stable Linux kernels is:  	2.6.11-ac7
(see the -ac patch explanation)
Thanks,
