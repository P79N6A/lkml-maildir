I doubt that.... from this description, you've been hacked.  Even if your
/etc/inetd.conf is in good shape, it looks like someone got in.
I'm guessing that your ls was also hijacked.  You're using RedHat, so try
the rpm -V command to verify that the ls binary is the same as what should
be in the package.  While you're at it, verify the package is the right one
(compare to a CD or distr ftp site).
Out of curiosity, are you running portmap?  Perhaps BIND?  There are lots
of potential culprits here -- but I suggest you verify all of your binaries
and go back and upgrade everything on your system, as well as re-visit the
issue of what daemons are started up at boot time.
