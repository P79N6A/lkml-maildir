And seem to be always used in conjuction with each other, not alone
across various functions in this driver alone but also across various
card services drivers.

struct another_local_struct *another_local;
another_local = kmalloc(sizeof(sruct another_local_struct),...);
or if single kmalloc is preferred, then:
struct another_big_struct {
  struct old_big_struct old_big;
  struct new_big_struct new_big;
} ;
I'd agree with your suggestion had it been "struct big", or "struct
huge" or "struct stack" or something like that, but does not seem
appropriate in this particular case.
