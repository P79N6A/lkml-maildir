I was hoping someone would have a suggestion for a problem I am having with
the 2.2.13 release. (Currently running 2.2.5-22 from Red Hat distribution)
I downloaded the 2.2.13 source code
I unpacked the source and 'cd /usr/src/linux'
I then did a 'make mrproper'
I then did a 'make xconfig'
I then did a 'make dep'
I then did a 'make clean'
I then did a 'make bzImage ; make modules ; make modules_install'
I then did a 'cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/linuz-2.2.13'
I then did a 'mkinitrd /boot/initrd-2.2.13.img 2.2.13'
I then did a 'cp /usr/src/linux/System.map /boot/linuz-2.2.13.map'
I then edited my lilo.conf and added a section for the 2.2.13 kernel called
'test' that looks exactly like the other two sections I have with the
exception of what kernel it is referencing and the lilo name entry.
I then did a 'lilo'
This all went as usual with no particular problems. When I reboot I typed
'test' from the lilo prompt. After getting just beyond the partition check
it gave me the following message:
"Kernel panic : VFS : Unable to mount root fs on 08:0a"
Does anybody have any idea on what step I missed or what I did wrong?
Thanks for any and all help,
