I don't think so.
For user space programs you want to use /usr/include/linux
which contains stuff that is stable - changes two or three
times a year.
For kernel modules you do not want to use /usr/include -
just like the kernel source itself does not use /usr/include -
you want to point a -I at the appropriate tree, just like
Miquel says, and once that is done the #include statements
themselves do not require a version.
