  The quota code isn't race-safe :-(. So it seems you triggered some
of these races. I've made patches for 2.2.6 (hopefully added in 2.2.8?)
but not for 2.0.x tree. So if nothing else prevents you from using 2.2.x
kernels I'd recommend you to use it. If you can't I can remake the changes
for 2.0.x kernels but it seems it will be a lot of work because the quotas
were rewritten in 2.1.x.
  Finally to the seriousity: As I'm looking into the 2.0.x code the worst I
can think of is quota corruption (but I won't give much for stake ;-)... Not
good but not a disaster.
  Also if you run only some personal machine you can just turn disk quotas off
;-) But this is probably the last resort.
