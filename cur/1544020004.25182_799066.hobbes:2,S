I thought it may only be one specific hwmon driver which could
interfere on ASUS boards with the ATK0110 device. I agree that
it would not make sense to cluster all hwmon drivers.
The problem is similar to the video backlight switching problem
(legacy drivers vs preferred generic ACPI video driver) where
you also must know which driver to take before module loading time.
I hoped to be able to come up with something more clever or say a nicer
solution or at least a short discussion. But I also have no better idea.
Maybe all such code should end up in a drivers/acpi/quirks.c file
at some time, similar to other places in the kernel.
I think it's time for Len looking at this. I wonder whether he will take
this patch or why he won't.
This is an ugly problem which unfortunately needs an ugly fix/check.
This code snippet should be part of your ATK0110 driver then and
not submitted/committed standalone?
Please take me into CC the next time you submit your asus-laptop/acpi driver, 
I like to have a look at it and can also give it a test.

Yes. ACPI can easily make sure that not several resources are accessed at
the same time. It's the ACPI vs native OS code where this is so hard.
