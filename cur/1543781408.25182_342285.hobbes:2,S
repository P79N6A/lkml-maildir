Yes, alas my bucket has leaks.  I was hoping for better assembly, but 
never got around to verifying.  So I matched this to shorter C code 
which I had obsoleted.

Since LDT is now in pages, it is only called when page reservation 
increases.   I chose a slightly bad name here for new_pages.  See 
further down:
        if (page_number >= mm->context.ldt_pages) {
                error = alloc_ldt(&current->mm->context, 
mm->context.ldt_pages,
                                        page_number+1, 1);
                if (error < 0)
                        goto out_unlock;
        }
I actually had to check the code here to verify there is no leak, and I 
don't believe I changed any semantics, but was very happy when I found this:
        if (old_pages) {
                ClearPagesLDT(oldldt, old_pages);
                if (old_pages > 1)
                        vfree(oldldt);
                else
                        kfree(oldldt);
        }

Yeah, there is no LDT common case.  This code could be made 100% optimal 
with a lot of likely/unlikely wrappers and additional cleanup, but 
seeing as it is already uncommon, the only worthwhile optimizations for 
this code are ones that reduce code size or make it more readable and 
less error prone.  I had to write a test that emits inline assembler 
onto a crossing page boundary, clones the VM, and tests strict 
conformance to byte/page limits to actually test this.  :)

Safe -- two call sites.  One has no LDT (cloning), and the other is here:
        if (page_number >= mm->context.ldt_pages) {
                error = alloc_ldt(&current->mm->context, 
mm->context.ldt_pages,
Note page_number is zero-based, ldt_pages is not.

You could leak data, but the code already takes care to zero the page.  
This is especially important, since random present segments could allow 
a violation of kernel security ;)
        if (reload)
                memset(newldt+old_pages*LDT_ENTRIES_PER_PAGE, 0, 
(new_pages-old_pages)*PAGE_SIZE);
Wow.  Thanks for a completely thorough review.  I have tested this code 
quite intensely, but I very much appreciate having more eyes on it, 
since it is quite a tricky biscuit.
