Hello:
I have a Sony Vaio laptop and I cannot make my Network PCMCIA card to run.
At startup, Yenta Socket is detected and lights from the ethernet card starts flashing but no network interface appears if I do "ifconfig".
What must I do to enable network capabilities? Is this a bug?
I can provide dmesg or other necessary things.
Thanks.
