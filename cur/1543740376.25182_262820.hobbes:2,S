OK. This problem has multiple parts.
The change to tty_io.c is necessary to get the proper delay
between setting and clearing break. I will submit that
patch for inclusion.
Now it is a matter of figuring why the device is not
sending the break. The device break_ctl() gets called,
and the URB to set the line control is sent successfully.
Maybe the comments are wrong on the line control bits
or possibly the Belkin device requires some other setup
to send breaks.
I'll see if I can figure anything out.
