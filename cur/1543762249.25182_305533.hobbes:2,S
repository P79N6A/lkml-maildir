I did posted once; it was long time ago. I am sure I sent it to Dave. I can 
resend if needed. Basically, I made Dave's stack work on 2.6 kernels; did 
some changes toward QoS and provided simple utility to imitate low level 
driver. I was concentrated on interfaces, it is still just skeleton.
I did not touched this work since then. I used to do stuff very close to 
802.11 stack. Now I am very busy with some different work.
I can however consult on any 802.11 standard issues, QoS in particular.
Maybe, it is good idea to talk to James Ketrenos as well. Last time I saw him 
doing good work on .11 stack.
