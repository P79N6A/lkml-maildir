IMO, the runtime (as opposed to compile-time) costs of any given C++
construct is trivially easy to predict, since it all translates to C
fairly trivially.
Part of what your discussing is a style issue.  When building a
kernel, performance is critical.  Therefore, it's simply *bad*style*
for an overloaded function to have one implementation that's seriously
more expensive than another.  It's just a matter of overloaded
functions being equivalent, and in the kernel, major runtime costs
simply must be considered in deciding equivalence.

No contradiction!  You're simply observing that C++ is flexible enough
to support multiple programming styles well.
  1. When optimizing for runtime performance, think about
     implementation costs.
  2. When optimizing for programmer productivity, don't.
No problem.  No free lunch, either.

You seriously expect average programmers to hack Linux?  I don't.
