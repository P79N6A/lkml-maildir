No, it's a matter of proper layering.  We generally don't want modules
like stackabke filesystems to call directly into methods but rather use
proper highlevel VFS helpers to isolate them from details and possible
changes.  The move to out of line security_ helpers just put this on the
radard.

Sounds fine.

The fix for security_file_ioctl is probably to either not do it at all
or move it the call to security_file_ioctl into vfs_ioctl and get it by
using that helper.  I suspect most other security_ exports should be
avoided similarly.
I also suspect the whole issue of where and how-many times to call LSM
methods for stackable filesystems is a huge can of worms and it might make
sense to talk to the LSM folks about it.
