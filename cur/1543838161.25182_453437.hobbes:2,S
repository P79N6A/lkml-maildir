NAK.  There are already issues with using the xxx_kernel variants of
the page table functions for IO mappings on later architectures (caused
by speculative loads hitting IO regions.)  This code needs to change
slightly so that we have xxx_io versions of pte_alloc and friends.
(It also means that we need an ioremap region and a separate vmalloc
region on ARM...)
