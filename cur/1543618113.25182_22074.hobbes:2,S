Now... I have a Sony Vaio FX-103 with the RICOH RL5C476 not the 75. The
laptop has 192 MB of RAM (not the standard 64) and a 10gb harddisk.
Mandrake 8.1 with a 2.4.16 kernel with a USB PCI IRQ Routing patch to
make USB work (yes I am waiting heavily for the ACPI stuff!).
Anyhow, no matter what I do (including your patch modified to work on
the different controller) I cannot get two cards to work inside this
laptop.
One is a wireless card, one is a compact flash converter thing (for the
camera).
Both cards work individually. The laptop locks up if I insert both
cards. There is no OOPS or anything... It just locks up. Removing the
cards does not spring it back to life.
It is probably down to the fact that the Vaio laptops assign everything
IRQ9. Please find attached my /proc/interrupts and lspci -vvv.
Any ideas?
Thanks
Lee P.

Is that true of the MPS table as well ? Can you deduce one from the
other
even if you dont have a usable APIC ?

It may not be enough. The AML can be doing register setup and
configuration.
