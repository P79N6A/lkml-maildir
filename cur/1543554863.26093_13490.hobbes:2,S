Hello,
I've updated eepro100 driver for 2.4 kernel branch.
So far, the most annoying initialization problem (expressing itself in "card
reports no resources" messages) hasn't been fixed.
The driver is available at
ftp://ftp.sw.com.sg/pub/Linux/people/saw/kernel/v2.4/eepro100.c
The main changes are:
 - fixes for 64-bit architectures (rx_copybreak, additional cpu_to_le32,
   PCI_DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL for RX descriptions)
 - a couple of timing fixes
 - a lot of code cleanup, minor fixes.
See 
ftp://ftp.sw.com.sg/pub/Linux/people/saw/kernel/v2.4/eepro100.changelog
for a detailed log.
Best regards
		Andrey
