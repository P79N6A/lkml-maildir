I think it's mostly because the marketeers haven't got to everyone yet
:-) The kernel might be e-enabled, but it's not fully
iBuzzwordcompliant.
Besides, having a *fully* XML parser/generator in the kernel is
extremely braindead, even if it's called libkernelxml ("I'm not really
quite in the kernel really") or something. What's so wrong with really
simple files being exposed to userspace? Most of these are less than a
single page of data and it's just dandy like that.
Jon.
