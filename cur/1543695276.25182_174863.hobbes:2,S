I noticed in the 2.6.0-test9 notes the following:
---
Neil Brown:
  o md -  Use sector rather than block numbers when splitting raid0
    requests
---
I'm not sure if this is related to the problem I was experiencing?!
Anyway this doesn't fix the problem I was having. I still get the errors
with -test9. Above patch to dm-table.c works for me.
Just thought I'd mention this..
