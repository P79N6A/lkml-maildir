Please submit as a separate patch. I try to keep non-kbuild stuff out of
the kbuild tree. This make is less confusing.
I will not commit this until sometime tomorrow - I have to set up
something so I can track bugfixes and enhancements in parallel.
This is 2.6.17 material IMO in kbuild land except if we want this in for
reiserfs before 2.6.17.
I try to be rather strict about bug-fixes versus enhancements in kbuild.
The latest unexpected breakage shows how easy it is to introduce
unexpected errors in someones build :-(
