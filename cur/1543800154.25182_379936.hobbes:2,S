i think i misunderstood you. I thought you wanted a mutex_t a'la 
kmem_cache_t (which is only fully defined in mm/slab.c) - for the 
purpose of hiding the implementation of mutex_t. If the implementation 
of mutex_t is still present in mutex.h, i dont see what the advantage 
is. What's the difference between 'struct mutex' and 'mutex_t', besides 
that first one being clearer that here we have a kernel object? (we 
generally use the _t types for type-safe variations of integer types, 
e.g. pte_t.)
