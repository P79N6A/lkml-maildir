Well the change to -nice values was to minimise the harm they do to everything 
else. They will still get the lowest latencies and the most cpu but no more 
than previously. The difference will be to more niced tasks. I'm not sure 
just how much cpu you require for wengophone because at -5 it would be 
getting a fair chunk of cpu with the RSDL 0.30. Anyway, by sheer coincidence 
I just emailed out that patch I was planning so feel free to try it.
