	ASCII (for the \n variant). Terminal may be smart enough to do
carriage return upon the line feed request. Doing the opposite is bogus.
\r==CR, \n==LF. As for CP/M choice - I seriously suspect that it was
carried from R*-11 family (and from general DEC conventions). DARPA used
TENEX and TOPS-20. I suspect that it can be traced back to TTY driver in
sufficiently early EXEC. It was logical on dumb terminals.
