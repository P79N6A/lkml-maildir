Some architectures definitly can't use it.  That's why the prototypes for
them arch in arch-headers.  No need to introduce totally useless wrappers.
The asm-generic one sounds like a good idea, but I'd wait with that one
until the consolidation is mostly finished, aka all architectures that
currently use more or less a copy of the i386 irq.c are migrated over so
we can see it's scope.

linux/irq.h is despite it's name _not_ a public header but a misnamed
asm-generic/hw_irq.h.  There's quite a few architectures with a completely
different interrupt architecture and for tose it won't compile.

make explicit what you can do easily instead of relying on the compiler.
It allows to get rid of your horrible generic_ hacks, cuts down compile
time and makes explicit to anyone looking at the code and Kconfig which
architectures use this.
