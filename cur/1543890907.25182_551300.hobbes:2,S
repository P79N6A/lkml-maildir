Aside from typos, I think it should be more clearly and strongly worded.
"These should never be seen by user programs.  To return one of these
codes, signal_pending() MUST be set.  Note that ptrace can observe these at
syscall exit tracing, but they will never be left for the debugged user
process to see."
Thanks,
Roland
