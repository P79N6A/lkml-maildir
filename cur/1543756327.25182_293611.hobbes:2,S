Sorry, it's addresses.
usb 5-1: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4
usb 5-1: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 5
usb 5-1: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 6
blah blah blah, neverending. So yes, it's probably the 
enumeration problem.
Also, when I plug in the PCMCIA card I get (sorry for the 
wrapping, Gravity sucks)

The card only has 2 USB ports .. why 5 ports here? Is this the 
same bug?
Another interesting tidbit is that I get:

hub 2-0:1.0: USB hub found
hub 2-0:1.0: 2 ports detected 
for the built-in ports ... I only have two USB ports on this 
machine though, why does it see 4 of them?
(Do you also need the lspci and/or lsusb and/or dmesg of the 
error that happens when I disable the EHCI driver and only let 
the OHCI manage the PCMCIA card?)
