And that's my point exactly. In terms of integrity, each timer serves the
same purpose - get the filesystem on disk in sync with what's in memory.
Obviously ext3 does a better job of this than ext2 in terms of recovering
from partial transactions, but in both cases the flush is accomplishing
the same thing. I can see no a priori reason why the ext3 journal flush
would be timed differently than ext2 journal flush. If the flush time for
ext3 should be shorter, then so should the time for everything else. See?
