But OTHO, if you buy 4 GB memory you want good performance. If you use
raw-io, then you need good IO performance, so you would buy a
DMA-controller.
Basically, I'm sure that 99.9% of the bounce buffer cases would be on
developer machines, noone would use such an installation for production.
I think it would be acceptable to say "if you want > 2 GB memory and
raw-io, then you must buy a DMA controller."
The only problem I currently see is software RAID-5.
