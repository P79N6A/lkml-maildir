No, the preferred way is to start with getting both the infrastructure 
and the users into -mm.
Adding infrastructure without users doesn't fit into the kernel 
development model.
The unused x86-64 idle notifiers are now bloating the kernel since 
nearly one year.

Where does the perfmon code use the EXPORT_SYMBOL's?
And having added bloat on one architecture is not an excuse for adding 
bloat on other architectures.
