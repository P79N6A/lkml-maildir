1) I don't believe anyone considers a link to an email archive a
serious proposal.
2) I don't care about what you and Larry come up with. I have no need
to get to the kernel source from other tools. I was only pointing out
that there was a solution on the table for achieving your goals and
that you are ignoring it.
Roman, You're the one that is complaining, write up your own proposal
and get a quote. LKML is not the place for your continued whining that
Larry should add features that only you want and that you don't want
to pay for. You have been given a way to solve your problem, make use
of it!
