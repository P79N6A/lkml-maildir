After disabling the internal IDE controller (thanks to Jens for getting me
to open the box :-) the boot process gets past this stage but freezes thus:
Intel PCIC probe: not found
ds: no socket drivers found!
request_module[block-major-8]: Root fs not mounted
VFS: Cannot open root device 08:01

I'll keep trying...
