I think it's buggy.  The SIGKILL should kill the whole process.

I think that precedent is enough reason to follow its example as the first
change.  We can consider more cleanups from there.

This is the big problem with exec that I've cited before.  It can even
happen with group-wide signals that should be fatal, but avoided the
__group_complete_signal special fatal case.  (e.g. the thread racing with
the exec thread just now unblocked the signal and dequeued it.)  IIRC it
was the biggest reason we wanted to revisit the whole MT exec plan.

I'd like to revisit the use of "fake" SIGKILL for group exits.  That goes
well with a rethink of MT exec.  But let's not get into all of that right now.
Thanks,
