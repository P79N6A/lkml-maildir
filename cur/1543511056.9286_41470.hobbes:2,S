A problem with WORD transfers. It didn't negotiate for sync
transfers properly upon startup. This is usually caused by termination
problems. However, no machine can be considered to be working if
it's over-clocked. When you over-clock the CPU (and its interface chips),
you put timing out-of-spec. All bets are off. The fact that a CPU manages
to boot an OS when it's over-clocked means nothing.
Cheers,
