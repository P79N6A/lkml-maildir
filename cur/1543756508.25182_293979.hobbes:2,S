Agreed. Doing it just for the sake of a generic solution is not the
point.

The changes we made to the generic layer in order to make it work on ARM
still call the level/edge/simple handlers.

Makes sense to add this to the generic code anyway.

There's a check whether a particular irq has been exclusively allocated
or is available for driver use. Not sure, if it does exactly the same
what you are talking about. Needs to be checked.

I implemented this basically, but it's not fully tested/functional yet.

Are you talking about PM wakeup ? If yes, it is not there, but isn't
this functionality useful for other platforms than ARM too ?

Having a generic irq_desc_t with an architecture specific member "struct
arch_irq_desc_t bla;" should do the job.

As expected :)
I accept your decision, but I hope that you are not completely opposed
to discuss a conversion at all, especially as other architectures will
benefit from the necessary changes to the generic code too. 
Thanks for the pointers so far.
