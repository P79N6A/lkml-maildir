Looks like this box has been broken since December, 2006!
Not booting unless "acpi=off" is a serious failure.

Please get Linux up and running on the two boxes
using whatever means are at your disposal (some mentioned
in the thread above are acpi=off, pci=noacpi,
pci=conf1, noapic hda=noprobe hdc=noprobe)
Download the latest stable kernel.org kernel (2.6.22.1 today)
Make sure that the latest kernel still fails unless
you apply the workaround(s).
Then open two a bug report for each machine here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ACPI
Attach the output from acpidump, as well as the
complete dmesg and lspci -vv output,
and paste the contents of /proc/interrupts.
Then, if you can capture the console output taken from the actual failure
case, that would be ideal

Lets see if we can find out what the problem is before we
blacklist the machines.
