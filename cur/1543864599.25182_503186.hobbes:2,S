oooookay, that's kind of like taking a sandblaster to a soup cracker.
seriously, though, there is the potential of breaking something with
this change since you can see how there is some inconsistency in how
it's done *now* just for powerpc which, in some places, defines its
own versions of this:
./arch/ppc/mm/pgtable.c:
	#define is_power_of_2(x) ((x) != 0 && (((x) & ((x) - 1)) == 0))
./arch/ppc/syslib/ppc85xx_rio.c:
	#define is_power_of_2(x) (((x) & ((x) - 1)) == 0)
./arch/powerpc/mm/pgtable_32.c:
	#define is_power_of_2(x) ((x) != 0 && (((x) & ((x) - 1)) == 0))
note how the first and third macros *won't* consider zero a power of
two, while the second one *will*.  hence the need for a single
standard for all of this, just to play it safe.
rday
p.s.  in case you missed it, that was a not-so-subtle plea to please
just apply this patch so we can move on.
