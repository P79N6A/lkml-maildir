It sounds to me like you had old modules lying around in the
/lib/modules/xxx directory that your new 2.2.12 build put its modules
into. Start by making a backup of whatever is in /lib/modules, then rm
the subdirectory tree that you're building, then redo make
modules_install, then boot with the new kernel. If you don't already
have a boot floppy you might want to make one first.
