SCSI support is necessary for USB storage, the rest is just for fun. :-)

Well, I _really_ had not much time to track this.  If I'd had time, I'd 
probably have checked all these things already.  I don't think there are any 
unusual things about what you list, though.

Good idea, I can do that.

Well, the patch-2.6.4.bz2 is 2.2+M big.  That's _a_ _lot_ of changesets, so I 
don't think I can figure out this, unless I know which one could 
_potentially_ cause the effects that I observe.  Please, give me a hint, if 
you have any idea.
