Sorry, I thought the descriptions in the patch were sufficient. 
Again, I wish viro would copy me on patches to cciss. Isn't that the normal protocol, include the maintainer in any updates?

It would make life easier for me if you could give each patch a nice
Subject: which describes what it does.  "cciss update [N of 6]" isn't very
meaningful.  And the name of the file into which you chose to place the
patch isn't a suitable description either.  Thanks.
All of these patches are generating rejects for me - eager beavers have
been patching your driver when you weren't looking.  Could you please redo
and reissue the patch series against -rc3?
Thanks.
