Ok, I released a new patchset, which should fix your problem :
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/lttng/patch-2.6.24-rc2-lttng-0.10-pre20.tar.bz2
You simply have to apply all patches up to
markers-support-multiple-probes.patch
I have moved the patch earlier in the patchset so you don't have to
apply lttng. I also fixed the coding style and bugs I encountered during
my testing. You may also want to try out
markers-multi-probes-test.patch, which is a test module that I used to
make sure the probes were correct upon multiple connect/disconnect. It
is useful when you activate the "marker_debug" integer in
kernel/marker.c.
For those interested in lttng, this version should be used with :
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/lttng/ltt-control-0.46-06112007.tar.gz
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/packages/lttv-0.10.0-pre2-07112007.tar.gz
