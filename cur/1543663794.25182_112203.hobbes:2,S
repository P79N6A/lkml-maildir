I don't see the problem since we can pass up to 6 parameters on the i386 
architecture. The extra argument will be passed on using the stack as the 
other arguments do because of the asmlinkage directive. Using a structure 
slows everything down too much; if you can use the stack I think it's 
better to do so. What about that PIC?

The implementation is already in kernel/ptrace.c, only the usage lives 
under the arch-dependent directories since there the sys_ptrace entries 
are located.

mmm... I thought it would be convenient to use ptrace for all the trace 
work.
