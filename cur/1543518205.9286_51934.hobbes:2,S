OK.  Hopefully I can answer your questions satisfactorily.

Further down, after the conversion to 16-bit mode, observe that
%si is moved into %es.  It was a placeholder prior to the mode-switch.

Actually, it isn't right now.  What *does* happen is that GRUB will
append a "mem=" option to the kernel command-line automatically with
the all the contiguous memory above 1MB.  It walks the SMAP interface
and collects all the memory into one chunk for older kernel interfaces
such as Linux and the *BSDs.
It would be relatively easy to add the "multiboot" boot format to the
Linux kernel, which would forward the full memory map, but I've been
kinda lazy.

Not right now.  Clearly I could have missed something in the testing
that has been done, but it is used by a pretty large community of people
and I'm currently pretty sure there has been no hang reported related
to this.
I'd love to try it on said system if you have one handy.  If nothing else,
it will give me a chance to figure out a workaround not based on #ifdef's,
as, for example, something related to this works fine on MS Windows.

I'm not sure I follow this.  There is some pretty careful checking to make
sure the SMAP interface returned actual data.  It isn't used unless all
those values are correct.  Plus, the MB is allowed to lie about it's memory
in the other interfaces if SMAP is supported.  I've seen systems return
only 32MB, for example, if SMAP is there.
Besides, an accumulated total of memory over 1MB up to the first
chipset hole is always generated and passed to the kernel anyway, in case
it ignores the SMAP info.  This is the value displayed in GRUB's bootup
screen.

The other possibility is to have it simply adaptively try to figure out
how much the BIOS will return, by trying it til the BIOS structures hit
a maximum size.  And have some kind of sane "give up" size.  Maybe add
an "advanced" feature where the user can specify the different probe
size, but NOT require it by default.
But in general, if the BIOS randomly walks over memory (which is what
this would be if I have specifically told it to return only 20 bytes),
this is very bad.

<chuckle>  Sure.
