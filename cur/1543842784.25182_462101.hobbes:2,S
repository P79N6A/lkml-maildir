I disagree on that one, as I disagree on Jesse terminology too :)
Ordering between stores issued by different CPUs has no meaning
whatsoever unless you have locks. That is you have some kind of
synchronisation primitive between the 2 CPUs. Outside of that, the
concept of ordering doesn't make any sense.
Thus the problem is really only of MMIO stores leaking out of locks,
thus it's really a MMIO vs. lock barrier, and it's a lot easier to
understand that way imho.
