I would vote for doing it the same way as sys_llseek, which avoids
this issue entirely by passing the upper half of pos sepearately:
asmlinkage ssize_t sys_preadv(unsigned long fd,
                               const struct iovec __user *vec,
                               unsigned long vlen,
			       unsigned long pos_high, unsigned long pos_low);
asmlinkage ssize_t sys_pwritev(unsigned long fd,
                               const struct iovec __user *vec,
                               unsigned long vlen,
			       unsigned long pos_high, unsigned long pos_low);
This is the only way I can see that lets us use a shared 
compat_sys_preadv/pwritev across all 64 bit architectures.
The libc can then add a trivial wrapper around the syscalls
to get the regular calling conventions.
Aside from that, have you considered doing something even more flexible,
like this?
struct piovec {
	void __user *iov_base;
	__kernel_size_t	iov_len;
	__kernel_loff_t pos;
};
asmlinkage ssize_t sys_pwritev(unsigned long fd,
                               const struct piovec __user *vec,
                               unsigned long vlen);
