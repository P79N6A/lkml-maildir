I've been working on documenting the current tty API and hope to do the
ldisc API too.  I guess I should put it up somewhere for people to poke
at...
Or do you mean document your changes in the API?  I've been trying to
keep up to date (got the recent ioctl changes that went in a few
versions ago) and would be glad to try to keep it current.
thanks,
