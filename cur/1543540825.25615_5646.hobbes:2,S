Amazing - I missed (unintentionally it was 1am!) an important detail - it
always hits in the same place because I always re-mke2fs the filesystem I
was extracting the tape onto but you spotted that it is ext2-related
anyway.
Now, in 2.4.0-test6-pre5 it doesn't lockup anymore but your patch doesn't
apply either (assuming because a slightly different incarnation thereof is
already there).
Thank you for fixing this!

Tigran
