I'm not sure i agree. If a cache isnt that important, then there wont be 
that much of them (hence they cannot interact with user pages that 
much), and it wont be used that frequently -> the VM will discard it 
faster. If there's tons of dentries and inodes and pagecache around, 
then there must be a reason it's around: it was actively used. In that 
case we should spread them out only if we know in advance that their use 
is global, not local - and we should default to local.
