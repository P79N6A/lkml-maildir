How would the fs based interface work ? 
plan9 style echo 'rename foo bla' > /dmfs/command would seem ugly to me
(just look at the horrible parser code for that in mtrr.c) 
doing it fully as fs objects (mv /dmfs/volume1 /dmfs/volume2 for rename)
could likely get complicated and it's doubtful that VFS semantics completely
map to DM volumes.
Unless you have a clear and simple way to handle these issues I would
suggest to stay with simple ioctls. They look clean enough.
