I really disagree. 
If you want to use netlink, do so. But do it from the /sbin/request-key
script or binary.
I've never seen a good binary deamon listening for things. It's a horrible 
interface. It's undebuggable, it's inflexible, and it's just plain nasty. 
I'm just looking at how _well_ /sbin/hotplug has worked out. I believe 
that it would have been a disaster done with a binary messaging setup.
