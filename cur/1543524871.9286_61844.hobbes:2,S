Subject: Memory leak in 2.3.43pre2 (select.c changes)

There's a memory leak in 2.3.43pre2 that showed visibly about 10 seconds
after starting X (I could see sawmill draw the window borders and
netscape felt slow), followed shortly by a grinding halt.  I can see the
problem quite easily by typing "free" over and over in an rxvt.  SMP dual
processor box, 128 MB ECC SDRAM.
Reverting the changes to select.c in 2.3.43pre2 seems to have fixed it.
Reviewing the serial console capture log shows this:

console shuts up ...
...Not a very graceful OOM, but I suppose if it's an in-kernel leak, this
makes sense.
