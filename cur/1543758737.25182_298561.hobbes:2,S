Subject: 2.6.11-rc5-mm1 nfs oddity, file creation => "no such file"

I observed an oddity on a nfs-mounted fs while using 2.6.11-rc5-mm1.
I tried to save a file from xfig, and got an error message about a
nonexisting file.  Now apps may have their own bugs, so I
retried in the shell:
$ cat > newfile
newfile: No such file or directory
$
Eh - of course it didn't exist - I was trying to create it!
This also resulted in "newfile" being created with size 0.
Repeating the "cat > newfile" worked fine once the zero-length
file existed.  Unfortunately, xfig always removes files before overwriting
so it couldn't save on the nfs volume at all.
File creation by "touch filename" worked flawlessly.
After this I rebooted into 2.6.11-rc3-mm1 which haven't shown this problem
so far.  There were nothing in "dmesg" when this happened, other
than a message about "mount" being older than the kernel.
I can try to recreate the problem if necessary.
