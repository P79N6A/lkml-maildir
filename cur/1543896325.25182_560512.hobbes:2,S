You're right. Look at:
commit a2d2b5cb8e5d8787f009eeb3bbca52687bd42a77
[

 ]
You could export ROOT_DEV to modules back again, or perhaps:
http://www.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2005-March/012290.html
to get around the build error.
[ It might've been unexported for good reasons, of course, see:
