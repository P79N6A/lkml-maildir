Hi,
I'm reviving an idea I implemented several years ago, namely the Linux
Incompatibility List.
The idea is simple: most hardware works fine with Linux, and the
situation is generally pretty good, with Linux increasingly showing up
on the corporate radar.
However, there are devices that don't work with Linux, for various
reasons (no specs, too new and no one has written a driver, etc...),
and it's easier to keep track of those devices so that people can
avoid them (or the hero types can write drivers for them).
I have a site up that will serve as the focus of these efforts, but in
order to guage interest/response and ramp up gradually, I'd like to
ask that those interested in participating in the effort send me
information via email.  I'll respond with the wiki's address, so that
they may then have a look around.
I think (correct me if I'm wrong) the information we would want to
collect is:
Product Name:
Manufacturer:
Model Number:
Chipset:
How bad it is (1 to 10, 9 being it almost works and has only minor
bugs):
Reason (no specs, driver still being worked on, ...):
Url for more info:
An email address of yours that we may publish (so that we can contact
you if someone says "no, that works just fine!"):
Notes:
Ideas/comments/suggestions are welcome at this stage.
Thankyou for your time,
