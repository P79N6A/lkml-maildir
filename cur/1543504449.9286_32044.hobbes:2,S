What I'd like to see is this dealt with in a SENSIBLE way, so both
operating systems see both versions of the name. That way, all such
problems vanish.
One obvious way round this would be to have the file always appear
under the MSDOS version of the name, with the LFN version appearing as
a hard link to it. Throw that in, and the problem mentioned above goes
away since tar then sees and records both versions of the name.
This would place two limitations on the hard link facility:
 1. Only one hard link to any given file. Therefore, the link
    count field in long directory listings is limited to show
    either 1 link (for a file without an LFN) or 2 links (for
    a file with an LFN).
 2. The hard link must be in the same directory as the file it
    points to.
I don't see either of those limitations as being any more restrictive
than what's already in use.
As far as I can se, the following problems would need dealing with if
this approach was adopted:
 1. Attempts to delete the MSDOS named link without deleting the
    LFN named link first.
 2. Attempts to rename the MSDOS named link to a name that is not
    compatible with the MSDOS 8.3 requirements.
 3. Attempts to rename the LFN named link to an MSDOS named link.
Attempts to delete the LFN name would succeed, resulting in the file
only having its MSDOS format name, and attempts to delete an MSDOS
named file with no LFN attached to it would succeed and remove the
file.
Comments?
Best wishes from Riley.
