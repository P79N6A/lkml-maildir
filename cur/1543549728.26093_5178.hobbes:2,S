Agreed --- this assumes that all pinned, nonswappable pages are
subject to resource limiting to prevent them from exhausting the whole
of memory.  For things like page tables, that means we need
beancounter in place for us to be 100% safe.  For the no-swap case,
that requires an OOM killer.
The problem of avoiding filling memory with pinned pages is orthogonal
to the problem of managing the unpinned memory.  Both are obviously
required for a stable system.
Cheers,
 Stephen
