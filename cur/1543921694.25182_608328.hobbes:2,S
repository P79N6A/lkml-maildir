I think m68k stack layout still guarantees 4-byte-alignment, no?

You still do need one bit for the discontiguous case, so it's not like you 
can avoid the hacks anyway (unless you just blow up the structure 
entirely) and make it a separate member). So once you have that 
bit+pointer, using a separate NULL entry isn't exactly prettier. 
Especially as we actally want to see the difference between 
"end-of-allocation" and "not yet filled in", so you shouldn't use NULL 
anyway, you should probably use something like "all-ones".
