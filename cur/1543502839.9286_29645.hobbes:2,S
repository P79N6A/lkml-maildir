   Hello! I keep getting the following message from knfsd after some
events:
Jul  1 23:36:30 jerry kernel: nfsd Security: /// bad export.
 
  It happens when the volume being shared by nfs is being backed up
remotelly with arkeia, and is under load. Usually the messages repeat
themselves hundreds of times, and the nfs clients complain of stale nfs
locks. The only option is to restart nfs. The volume size is around 100GB
(external raid), the kernel is 2.2.7 with knfsd 1.3.2 patches aplied and
package installed. Its impossible to predict since the machine can run for
weeks without problems. Anyone knows what is causing it?
T.A.
