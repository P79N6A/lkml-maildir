Hm, I think you're a bit confused here.
/sbin/hotplug has nothing to do with modules.  It works just fine with a
kernel with everything built in.  /sin/hotplug is getting called when
anything in the system changes, like a device is discovered or removed.
Now the fact that the current hotplug package that implements a version
of /sbin/hotplug only really handles loading new modules for devices
that do not currently have drivers bound to them, is only an
implementation detail.  The hotplug package will start to change soon,
based on the new information that is being spit out by your kernel.

initramfs and "everything must be a module" are two different
discussions.  Only after the first happens can we even start talking
about the second.
And even if we don't ever agree that everything has to be a module, the
initramfs implementation moves a whole lot of crap out of kernel space,
and into userspace, that I can't see any good reason not to have it.
But let's wait for Al's latest initramfs patches to start talking about
that topic, I thought this thread was about evms :)
thanks,
