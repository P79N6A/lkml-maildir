	My idea of putting this info on swap was that when the disk is moved
from one system to another system, the statistics stays with the swap
itself. If the swap disk(partition) is put in a different system which has
different configuration(that which would affect the performance info on the
disk), then we can recompute the statistics, otherwise there is no need to
rerun the utility every time the swap disk is moved. 
	Also the kernel would be smart enough to know about the swap
performance without the need for an utility to invoked, to set the
parameters through IOCTL.
