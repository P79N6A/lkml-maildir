That's true.  But sec. 9 of the GPLv2 says:
  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you
  may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
So, by making the COPYING contain the v2 text, is the author
specifying a particular version?  If yes, then the sec. 9 provision
would be meaningless, since there would be no way to not specify a
version number.  
My understanding is that courts would presume that a license term has
a meaning, if it has a plausible reading.  And there such a reading:
that to specify a version, there needs to be (e.g. in the source
files) a statement like, "This file [or work] is licensed under the
GNU GPLv2."
Corrections, flames, etc. are welcome.
