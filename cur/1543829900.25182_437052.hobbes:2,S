static int ahci_host_init(struct ata_probe_ent *probe_ent)
{
        struct ahci_host_priv *hpriv = probe_ent->private_data;
        struct pci_dev *pdev = to_pci_dev(probe_ent->dev);
as you can see, you can easily go from an ata_probe_ent to a pci
device... 
also.. you could just put your code into the remove hook... :)
