If you remove any code inside the #ifdef CONFIG_QNX4FS_RW we might
as well remove the option "config QNX4FS_RW" altogether.
It's horribly broken, and I don't intend to fix it; while I was
thinking about how to properly implement write-support, somebody else
went away and did it. As that alternative seems to work well and is
being actively maintained, I won't try to reinvent it.
