Not if you use my 2.2 tree or any recent 2.4 out there. I mean that's
not an apache mistake, you shouldn't backout that change because of a
kernel race condition.

I'm not sure what apache does exactly while handling new connections but
your above description of the sympthoms sounds ok.

No because the same task cannot run accept() and select() at the same
time, that's a per-task vs per-waitqueue_t issue (not per-socket),
imagine it like accept() calling select() interally in the kernel, which
doesn't happen of course and that's why it cannot trigger in real life,
you cannot exploit it from userspace, it's a kernel internal issue. So
don't worry about it ;) My patch has the bonus to fix it as well though
(like 2.4).
