Subject: [PATCH] kfree_skb() bug in 2.4.22
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all,
I was debugging one of my iptables/netfilter modules yesterday and I
came across this bug in kfree_skb(). One of my functions returns a
struct skbuff * on success and NULL on failure. When it failed, the code
calling said function attempted to free the struct skbuff *, which at
that point was NULL. This produced a kernel panic. I investigated the
problem and found that, not only should I be checking for a NULL pointer
when freeing the struct skbuff *, but the actual cause of the panic was
because kfree_skb() and kfree_skb_fast() do not check for skb==NULL,
either. They immediately attempt to dereference the users field of the
struct skbuff * in order to decrement that reference counter. 
I have come up with a patch that applies to both the 2.4.22 pristine
source tree and the 2.4.23-pre6 source tree that solves this issue (see
below). I tried to follow Documentation/SubmittingPatches to the letter;
please let me know if I failed this in some way. Thanks :)
P.S. I wasn't sure who exactly maintains this particular code; that's
why I just sent it to everyone listed in MAINTAINERS remotely associated
with include/linux/skbuff.h ;)
