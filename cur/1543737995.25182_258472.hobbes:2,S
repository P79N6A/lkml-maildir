Hi,
/proc shows the wrong PID as parent in the following case
Process A creates Threads 1 & 2 (using pthread_create)
Thread 2 then forks and execs process B
getppid() for Process B shows Process A (rightly) as parent,
however /proc/B/status shows Thread 3 as PPid (incorrect)
Following patch has been tested and it works ok
Regards,
Dinakar
