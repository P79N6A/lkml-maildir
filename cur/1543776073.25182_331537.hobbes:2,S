I'd assume so - there are basically no resource changes in -rc2, but -rc1 
has a lot of PCMCIA updates. Dominik - the full dmesg is in the original 
report by Rafael on linux-kernel, mind taking a look?
However, the above also seems to have tried to allocate a 64-bit resource,
and I wonder if that's right. Rafael, what does lspci say? Is that 2:1.1
device actually 64-bit capable? Sounds unlikely (they are pretty rare),
and hat would be a PCI layer bug if not.

Indeed, if 2:1.1 is your cardbus bridge, I can pretty much guarantee that
it's not using 64-bit windows. So Greg, I think you might be at least
partially involved..
