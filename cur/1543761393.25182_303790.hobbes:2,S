I replaced the set_blocksize with a sync_blockdev as I mentioned in my
previous reply and then ran a 24+ hour test that used to fail within a
few minutes. It passed.
As for resetting the block size either before the mount or on final
close, I don't think it's necessary.
Every block filesystem either calculates block numbers using the current
blocksize or explicitly sets the block size itself. Further, the default
blocksize isn't related at all to some "ideal" blocksize for any
particular device, it's just 1k.
It seems to me that the only case restoring the block size seems to
cover is this:
1. process opens the block device non-exclusively, and may set the block
size
2. kernel mounts filesystem, resetting the blocksize to its need
[...]
3. kernel umounts filesystem, returning blocksize to previous value
4. userspace closes block device
The problem with this is that userspace has no expectation whatsoever
that the block size be anything in particular unless it has exclusive
access to the device. If the device isn't open with exclusive access,
the kernel can and will change the blocksize while the userspace process
has the device open. O_EXCL works on block devices (see blkdev_open),
and if it is opened with exclusive access, the kernel can't claim the
device to mount the filesystem.
Therefore, I propose that simply changing the set_blocksize to a
sync_blockdev is sufficient.
