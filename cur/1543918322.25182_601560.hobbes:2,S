Even all of the last bisect steps still showed the same line...

I'm now finished with bisecting, still 2 patches, but I don't want to
spend another two hours waiting...
And the winners are: (from broken-out patchset of 2.6.23-rc4-mm1)
maps2-simplify-interdependence-of-proc-pid-maps-and-smaps.patch
maps2-move-clear_refs-code-to-task_mmuc.patch
Before these patches I have never seen the bug, with these I only got
two good boots when trying to recreate the problem. But even the
kernels that did one good boot failed on the second try.

I have *NO* clue how these procfs changes can kill the sata_sil24
driver, but all bisect steps point to these two patches as cause or
trigger of the bug.
