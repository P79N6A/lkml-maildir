It can be easily caught. Thats what rpm is for. If it let you install that
package on a box that can run it without using --force type options its
a bug.

FPU emulation should probably have been in glibc via a fault handler
but thats a historical story.

Then while you are it you can make the kernel magically recover from rm -rf /
or rm * in /lib...
