5 seconds is unfair and unrealistic though. The *hardware* negotiation
before link is seen can easily take upto 45 seconds already.
That's a network topology/hardware issue (spanning tree fun) that
software or even the hardware in your PC can do nothing about.
this means that the "power up time" needs to be at least 45 seconds, if
it's then down 5 seconds inbetween... that's not real power savings.
