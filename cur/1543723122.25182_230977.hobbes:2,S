You were unsubscribed on 12th of June.
Your address sent back "user unknown" reports.
Perhaps your service provider had some problems ?
(It is possible, that DaveM logged wrong reason for your address'
removal, and it really should have been "mailbox full", that "reason"
text entry is a manual thing...)
We do take "user unknown" (in many forms/wordings) at the face value,
and we don't go around presuming that there is a temporary glitch,
when we receive it (in some cases there are .. many universities
have had problems with NIS(+) + sendmail  which combination is unable
to differentiate database access problem from genuine 'user unknown'
situations.)
Another reason for instant subscription revocation is "mailbox full".

You have to resubscribe yourself.
We do appreciate that you asked at first.  Just doing blind
resubscribing without finding out why the list feed had been
cut, isn't the best thing to do...
