    And some years ago you gave us (i.e. the Linux community) to understand that 
    "the system" was to be based on the Hurd,
That's true.  We are developing the Hurd, which is an advanced kernel.
We started the Hurd because there was no free kernel, and a complete
free operating system requires a kernel.  (Linux did not exist then.)
We're continuing to work on the Hurd because after doing so much work,
it would be a shame not to finish it.
					      and that we were at best 
    hangers-on.
The Hurd isn't meant to express any opinion about any person.  I'm
sorry if you took it that way, but that meaning was not intended.
I use GNU/Linux all the time, and that's what I recommend to everyone
who asks what system to install.  That's what we install at the FSF,
by preference, when we get a machine.  If this makes some people
"hangers on", I must be one of them.
