Because they are _more_ than files. Because their native interface is
_not_ a file one. Because there is a way to produce a file interface from
block device one and _that_ is what fs/block_dev.c does. I.e. it's an
interface converter.
Now, look at the mount(). Or swapon(). Tell me, where is a file? Or inode,
for that matter (esp. for root mount). See also ioctl() usage in ISOFS.
Where the hell is a file? See also raw devices - there you _have_ file,
but the problem is that it's already in use.
They are not files. There is a way to make a file out of a block device,
and that's fine - that's all users see (almost). But for the kernel they
_are_ different.

Oh, please. Yes, we can merge that with FIFO pointer. But complaining
about the struct inode bloat is kinda funny - the first thing to do is
going for separate allocation of per-fs data.
