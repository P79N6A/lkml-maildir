PCI accesses are not free, so anything that avoids having to
go over the PCI bus is a worthwhile optimization.
The processor buses run at 200-800Mhz or so, whereas PCI is normally
only clocking at 33Mhz, sometimes at 66Mhz.
With good ADMA or host-queuing controllers that access system
memory directly for their command blocks, then there's not much
(if any) penalty for the extra LBA48 setup.  But for "normal"
controllers (if such a beast even exists), the extra writes across
the PCI bus can be costly.
Hardware write-buffer FIFOs between the CPU and the PCI bus
can reduce the impact of this somewhat, but they are often
only 2-4 entries deep, and will be filled by a normal (S)ATA
command setup sequence.
This is one of those finer points that is very difficult to measure,
since the I/O throughput is pretty much unaffected by it.  But CPU
cycle count per-I/O setup is one way to measure it.
Cheers
