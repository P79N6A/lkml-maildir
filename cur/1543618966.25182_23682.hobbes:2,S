My explanation above is borked, please see my reply to wli.  In short, each 
page table of the parent is already either shared - in which case the CoW 
ptes are already marked RO - or it was instantiated by the parent, in which 
case the work of marking its pte's RO is insignificant, and is certainly not 
more than the cost incurred by the current method.
