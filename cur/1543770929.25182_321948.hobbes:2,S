At least for kernel compiles, using non-temporal stores is a slight 
win (a 2-5s improvement on 4m30s).  Granted, there seems to be a 
lot of variation in kernel compile times.
A bit more experimentation shows that non-temporal stores plus a 
prefetch of the resulting data is still better than the existing 
routines and only slightly slower than the pure non-temporal version.  
That said, it seems to result in kernel compiles that are on the high 
side of the variations I normally see (4m40s, 4m38s) compared to the 
~4m30s for an unpatched kernel and ~4m25s-4m30s for the non-temporal 
store version.
