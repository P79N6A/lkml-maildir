A slightly different objection than Andrew's: this will rapidly eat up
all the pages available for, e.g., receiving network packets, probably
not what you want.  How about flags=0?  This will dip a little way into
reserves but not as far as interrupts or realtime tasks, and will not
attempt any reclaim.  (Maybe we should have a GFP define for that.)

You don't need to initialize the list element you are adding.
