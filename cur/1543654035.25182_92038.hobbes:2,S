Ewww, you are a sick lad 8)
But I'm not sure that there is any interface which wouldn't break horribly
when faced with that possibility.
The patch to restore /proc/ksyms is trivial.  As is the addition of a start
entry /proc/modules.  When combined with rth's simplified loader, it should
be sufficient for both ksymoops and oprofile.
kgdb needs a patch to work, anyway: you might want to restore /proc/ksyms
in that patch?  (I don't use kgdb, so my ignorance here is complete).
Rusty.
