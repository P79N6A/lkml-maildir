I have the results in an Excel spreadsheet, but I'm only attaching the
plot in postscript format to simplify things.  If you'd like me to send
you the .xls file, let me know.  Note that the results included here are
only for "rewrites", not "writes".
The most interesting things I see are:
1.  the reiser patch you sent me made a noticeable improvement, but it
didn't matter whether I used the noatime mount option or not.
2.  reiser has a reproducible spike in throughput at 4k i/o size, and it
even beats ext2 in that single case.
3.  (and sort of off topic...) ext2
throughput drifts slightly down for i/o sizes >64k as we go from 2.4.0 ->
2.4.3 -> 2.4.4
Thanks,
Lance
