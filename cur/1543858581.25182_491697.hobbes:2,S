Hello Uli,
  Yes, apologies, I had been waiting for an abandoned bugzilla entry
to get attention, and when I realized it was assigned to a dead-end, I
had simply posted the patch without checking for prior messages.
  I was further confused by the fact that it hadn't made its way into
any of the 19-gitX sets (and for that matter, the window for
2.6.20-rc1 has come and gone and this still remains unfixed), despite
how clear the error was and how trivial the fix seems.
