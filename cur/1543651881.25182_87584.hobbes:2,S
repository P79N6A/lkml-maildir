I'm getting really nervous :-( Is kdb able to track who caused unbalanced
in_atomic() incrementation? 
After more than week of stable system I run simple 
"arp vanicka.vc.cvut.cz" few minutes ago, and after arp output I got 
sleeping function called from illegal context, quickly followed by two
scheduling while atomic, and finally it died because of userspace faults 
when in_atomic() is != 0 are treated as kernel ones...
As I saw nobody else reporting this or simillar problem, I'll start
looking at e100 driver I use. Maybe it did not occured because of I
was running -acX kernels since 25th Oct until yesterday. Anybody knows?
                                                Thanks,
