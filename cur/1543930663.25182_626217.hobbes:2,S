The same thing has happened twice now, both during the weekly check of
the md0 and md1 RAID1-arrays. That is, networking on the primary
interface is dead. It's interrupt (irq 21) is shared between sata_nv
and forcedeth.
Is there anything I can do to debug this problem?
I don't have access to the logs right now but will have later.
