The original impetus for separating /var from /usr was not that stuff
in /var is temporary, but that anything that the system has to write
to in the course of normal operation goes there... that was so that
/usr could be a filesystem that was shared by many machines (i.e.
NFS mount for diskless workstations, etc.)  /var is for data that is
"variable" from machine to machine, so that /usr can be "constant".
