Well, you get strict behaviors as expected for this scheduler.

This is way beyond what SCHED_OTHER should do. It can't predict the universe.
Much of the interactivity estimator borders on magic. It just happens to
also "be a good fit" for hacky apps as well almost by accident.

We can do MUCH better in the long run with something like Con's scheduler.
His approach shouldn't be dismissed because it's running into a relatively
few minor snags large the fault of scheduleing opaque applications. It's
precise enough that it can also be loosened up a bit with additional
control terms (previous email).
It might be good to think about that a bit to see if a schema like this can
be made more adaptable for the environment it serves. You'd then have both
precisely bounded control over CPU usage and enough flexibility for burstly
needs of certain apps.
