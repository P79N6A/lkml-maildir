You won't be able to update it... Even in the face of real problems that
must be updated (as in a major security problem).

According to the kernel it is the same version - the binary module loaded, it
just doesn't work. And no way to get it working either.
This also applies to other minor options - like AMD optimizations, PII/P3/P4
optimizations... They all run the same Kernel version... Even when they are
uniprocessor only...
So now you ALSO have to have that third party to distribute BINARY versions
of the kernel to make that binary driver work. And you can't make any
changes.. because that may/would break the system... You can no longer
upgrade your system. You might be able to go from P2 to p3, but if the
driver was built for p3, expect problems on a p2.
And blow it out your ear if you want an IA64, or even a 64 bit AMD.
And you don't even know what options that third party used in building their
kernel, and can't create an equivalent...
And forget trying to get any help for a problem. Especially if there are
two such modules you need... If you think the finger pointing is bad now,
think about what happens then.
Which is why I don't buy, nor even recommend, devices that reqire closed
source drivers.
There are just too many combinations of options that make a single (or even
limited number of) version(s) of a binary module either unusable or
unsupportable.
