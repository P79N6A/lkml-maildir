Subject: [PATCH] cpu hotplug fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/3/20/4

start_cpu_timer was changed to __init a few hours before the cpu hotplug
patches went in. With cpu hotplug it can be called at any time, so fix
this.
