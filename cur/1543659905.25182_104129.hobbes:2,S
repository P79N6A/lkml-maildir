That's broken. you need to get the proper kernel CFLAGS, and you shouldn't 
assume there's anything useful in /usr/src/linux.
Use "/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build" as a default kernel directory, but 
allow it to be overridden somehow from the command line. Then do something 
like...
	make -C $(LINUXDIR) SUBDIRS=`pwd` modules
... to build your module. That way, all the kernel build stuff will be 
correct; it'll be just as if you were in a normal subdirectory of the 
kernel tree during a 'make modules' run.
