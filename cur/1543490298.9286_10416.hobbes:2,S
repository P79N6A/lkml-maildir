This line uses a test for a variable (rii_p) that is not always set when the
byte is clobbered. However, I don't know much about this. In any case, this
cosmetic change should be made:
th->saddr[0]&=0x7f  to  th->saddr[0] &= ~TR_RII (line 323 again)

Well, not mine. I get 10:40 as the first two bytes of each destination MAC
address and everything thereon is two bytes out. Perhaps this is a driver
difference. Could you possibly let me know which patch and tcpdump version
you use? Thanks.
Giuliano Procida.
