There's nothing to fix. It is not broken. It just does /sbin/poweroff;
that's correct.
/sbin/poweroff is there on almost all systems; that is not case with
acpid. Currently *noone* has acpid that handles critical properly,
right?
So I believe that change is bad idea. /sbin/overtemp lets user
configure it etc.
Ouch and btw I've done some torturing on one prototype (AMD). It had
thermal at 98Celsius (specs for this cpu said 95C max), and I ended my
test at 105Celsius. I do not know about TM1/TM2 etc, but in this case
hardware clearly failed to do the right thing.
I do not know why acpid should be involved in this. execing binary
seems safer to me -- acpid might have died (OOM? segfault?), and exec
does not strike me like too ugly.
