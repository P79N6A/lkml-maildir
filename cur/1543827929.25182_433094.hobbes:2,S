I thought 64bit is more inclusive. Works both for 32bit and 64bit BARs.
Also exports memory more than 4G through /proc/iomem without selecting
an additional option in config file. The flip side is that it introduces
little memory overhead. I thought most of the users should be ok with this
increased memory usage and those who are particular, they can choose
RESOURCES_32BIT.
Thanks
