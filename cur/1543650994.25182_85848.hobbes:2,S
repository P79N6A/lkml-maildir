I dealt with crash dumps quite a lot over 10 years with SCO UNIX,
OpenServer and UnixWare: which were addressing the PC market, not
own hardware.
It's a real worry that writing a crash dump to disk might stomp in the
wrong place, but I don't recall it ever happening in practice.  But
occasionally, yes, a dump was not generated at all, or not completed.
Of course, you could argue that SCO's disk drivers were more stable :-)
which might or might not be a compliment to them.
