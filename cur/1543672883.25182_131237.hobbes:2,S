The doc I have state in several places:
"The denormals-are-zeros mode was introduced in the Pentium 4 processor 
with the SSE2 extensions."
Maybe I should download a newer doc from Intel. The one I have states
that DAZ is associated with sse2, and does not speak at _all_ of the 
MXCSR_MASK field (I have seen it in my x86_64 doc though).

So the question is, are there processors in the wild which have DAZ but
still clear the MXCSR_MASK field?
It's simply a matter of rewriting the MXCSR_MASK macro, but to avoid
a conditional, I'd rather have a global mxcsr_mask variable somewhere
with the cpu feature flags.
