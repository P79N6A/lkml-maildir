This is only half the story I'm afraid.  It doesn't take account of the
fact that the command line can be passed from the boot loader via the
ATAG structures, which are only parsed after the machine specific
fixup has happened (which can also modify the ATAGs).
You're also not guaranteed to have an ATAG list before setup_arch() is
called - it might be a param_struct, and we convert that to an ATAG list
before ATAG parsing.
So there's quite a bit which needs to be done to get at the command line.
Basically, what's required is:
- convert param struct to tag list
- if no tag list, use default tag list
- run machine specific fixups which may set memory layout
- if memory layout has been set, kill off any memory atags to prevent it
  being overwritten
- parse all atags which includes setting the command line if such a tag
  is found
Then, and only then can you be sure that you have the right command line.
