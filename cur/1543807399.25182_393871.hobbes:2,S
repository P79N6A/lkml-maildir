I am disturbed by the introduction of #defines like current_vps() and
vps_utsname.
Magic lower case #defines are usually a bad idea.  
These defines hide the cost of the operations you are performing.
At that point you might as well name the thing system_utsname
so you don't have to change the code.  
And of course you failed to change several references to
system_utsname.
