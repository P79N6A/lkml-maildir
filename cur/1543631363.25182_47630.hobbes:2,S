We're actually playing with Oracle apps - I'm told they already run on threaded
mode on NT ... I personally get the feeling that Oracle's commitment to Linux is 
distinctly half-hearted. The whole support matrix debacle was pretty indicative, 
IMHO. All personal opinion, I speaketh not for IBM.

We can but try, but I still think some transparent magic would be implementable.
