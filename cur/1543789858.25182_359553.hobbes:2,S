Subject: [PATCH 7/9] ipmi: bt restart reset fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/21/91

The current BT retry/reset mechanism fails to succeed on a PowerEdge
1650, when the controller is wedged with B2H_ATN asserted at
XACTION_START.  If this occurs, no further commands will ever succeed
unless the state of the controller is first cleared out.
Furthermore, the soft reset would only occur if the first command
after insmod was the one that timed out, not if a later command timed out.
This patch changes the retry/reset mechanism to be as follows:
Before retrying a command, clear the state of the BT controller such
that the flags represent ready for a new transaction.  This increases
the chance of success of the restarted transaction.
After 2 retries, issue a soft reset and retry one more time before
giving up and reporting back a failure.
