Why HIFN must be chardev?

The user can not use HW crypto processors, since he does not
know if HW is broken or not, and thus must validate each crypto
operation, i.e. reencrypt data in SW.
Not the point.
Validation can be performed in other HW 
(like Xilinx which routes HW requests to the real devices),
or in driver (if it is not FIPS validation).
So I still insist on creating ability to contribute entropy directly,
without userspace validation.
It will be turned off by default.
