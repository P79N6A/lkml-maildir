That would be on the OS side of the global lock.. However the OS still 
needs to maintain its own synchronization between its accesses to the 
controller, the global lock is not intended for that purpose. It doesn't 
sound like the HDAPS driver and the ACPI code are necessarily 
synchronizing their accesses (though I can't say I've looked at the code).
