Okay, but creating a list of pages should be extremely easy.
Alternatively, with the "save kernel" might be able to read the existing
data structures directly.

Well, the new kernel can be loaded at any time, and would be done in
exactly the way kexec loads a kernel.  It would probably make sense to
load the kernel into memory (but not jump to it) as the very first step
of hibernation.

I agree that the default behavior should be to completely shut down the
devices.  Later, special support could be added to select devices to
allow them to not be fully shut down.

In that case, the devices can indeed be fully shut down, at least
initially.

Certainly.  Note that any filesystems that are available to the "save
state" kernel would have been specifically mounted under that kernel.
There isn't any real possibility of confusion over which filesystems are
safe to access.

But kernel threads also rely on userspace, due to e.g. fuse and usermode
helpers.

Not necessarily relocatable (although that would be the usual
solution).  It just needs to be loaded at a different address than the
normal kernel.  If it isn't relocatable, the memory that would be needed
by the "save kernel" would have to be reserved at boot.

Grub, its configuration, and the kernel used to resume the system had
better be on a "safe" filesystem already (i.e. a separate, unmounted
before hibernation /boot).

I think hibernate-script already includes support for modifying grub's
configuration.

As far as I understand it, the swsusp resume path involves the boot
kernel loading the entire image from disk to available memory, then
shutting down all the devices, and copying the memory into place, and
then jumping to the original kernel, which reinitializes devices and
starts tasks running.  This isn't very different from what I was
proposing as the alternative anyway, except that: memory is copied once,
which is pretty fast, but means that only up to half of the total memory
can be saved.
The suspend2 resume path is a bit more complicated, it seems: it copies
some of the kernel memory off disk to available memory (everything
except page caches), shuts down devices, copies that memory in place,
jumps to it, and then the original kernel reinitializes devices, and
copies the remaining pages off disk into place directly.  Having the
original kernel take care of copying some memory back would be totally
incompatible with my proposal, since the original kernel would not be
prepared to access the device containing the hibernate image (since it
never accessed the device during hibernation).

The gain would be a faster resume from hibernation, because there would
be no need to load unnecessary drivers.  The disadvantage is that
instead of being able to just go on and boot a normal system if resuming
fails, it would be necessary to reboot.  I don't think that presents a
significant inconvenience.

The whole reason to want to checkpoint filesystems was so that the
original kernel would remain a fully-functional system with a
fully-functional userspace that can continue to access the filesystems
while the hibernate image is being written.  In addition to the lack of
checkpoint support, however, there are a number of other issues that
this would create: Even if you can checkpoint filesystems, you can't
checkpoint the entire world.  The kernel will keep acking network
packets, and userspace as well will send any normal replies.  If a
document was sent off to be printed right before the checkpoint, it
might end up printing while the image is being saved, and then printed
again when the system resumes.
Fundamentally, I don't think checkpointing is the right answer.  What is
desired is a fully functional system with a fully functional userspace
during the image writing.  But we don't want this to be the _same_
system that is actually being imaged.
That is why I think the kexec solution is the elegant solution.

There is also the key benefit of allowing an arbitrary userspace in a
fully functional system to be used to both save and load the image.  As
far as I understand, uswsusp allows a single userspace processes to run
to handle the loading and saving, but the processes runs in a rather
fragile userspace with most things disabled; in particular, this
userspace process can't access a fuse filesystem and probably can't do
other things like fork.
> Still, I don't think we could implement it quickly and easily.
It is hard to say how hard it would be.  I think a lot of the existing
kexec and hibernate code could be leveraged.
