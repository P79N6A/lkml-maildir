Thats true. The current CKRM CPU scheduler is not a standalone 
component...if it were made one, it would need a non-CKRM interface to 
define classes, set their shares etc.
However, we have not investigated the possibility of making our CPU 
scheduler a pluggable one that could be loaded into a kernel equipped 
with the plugsched patches AND the CKRM framework. This should be 
possible but not a high priority until there is more  consensus for 
having CPU schedulers pluggable at all  (we have more basic stuff to fix 
in our scheduler such as load balancing).
Of course, we're more than happpy to work with someone willing to chip 
in and make our scheduler pluggable.
