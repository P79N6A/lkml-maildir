My module needs use of the local APIC for performance counter setup.
Currently I am detecting the various ways it can be enabled/disabled as follows :
static int __init apic_needs_setup(void)
{
        return
/* if enabled, the kernel has already set it up */
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC
        0 &&
#else
/* 2.4.10 and above do the necessary setup */
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE > KERNEL_VERSION(2,4,9)
        0 &&
#else
/* otherwise, we detect SMP hardware via the MP table */
        !smp_hardware &&
#endif /* 2.4.10 */
#endif /* CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC */
        smp_num_cpus == 1;
}
this is obviously ugly, and more importantly fails when passing noapic,nosmp etc.
as boot options.
How would people feel about exporting a flag for local APIC setup that modules can look at ?
If it's OK I'll send a patch.
My module is not the only one that needs this (e.g. the APIC timers module)
