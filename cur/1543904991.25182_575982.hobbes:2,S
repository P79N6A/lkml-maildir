Indeed, any app doing what volanomark does is pretty inefficient.
But this is not the point. I/O schedulers are pluggable to help for
inefficient apps too. If apps would be extremely smart they would all
use async-io for their reads, and there wouldn't be the need of
anticipatory scheduler just for an example.
The fact is there's no technical explanation for which we're forbidden
to be able to choose between CFS and O(1) at least at boot time.
