I know why it happened, silly.
This was just an example of a real world example that actually happened, 
where BK sucked ass :)
Marcelo's BK tree did not exist when I created my marcelo-2.4 tree. 
 marcelo-2.4 repo existed for a while and people started using it.  Once 
Marcelo appeared with his "official" BK tree, people naturally want to 
migrate.  There were two migration paths: (1) export everything to GNU 
patches, or (2) click the mouse 300 times.
So, knowing that duplicate patches are a bad thing helps not in the 
least here...
