Hello,
  I am in the process of porting some (kernel) code from x86 to alpha and
have run into this problem:  Under x86, the check for whether we are in a
syscall goes something like this:  Does eax == (at least) one of three 
values, is orig_eax >= 0?  yes?  good, we are in a syscall.  What is the 
equivalent for alpha?  I've grokked sources and it doesn't seem to be
painfully obvious.  Thanks in advance.
        -Jeff
