Thanks.  Conclusion.  I could not find bit 16 (the enable bit) set in any of
your hypertransport msi mapping capabilities.
So MSI interrupts won't work until someone enables your chipset
to transform them into hypertransport interrupts.
Ideally it is a BIOS issue, but it may be the kind of thing we can
fix up with quirks in the kernel.
