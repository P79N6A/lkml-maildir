This is ugly for distribution maintainers as pick the wrong Kconfig
options and your device breaks. You need a different build depending on
the hardware you have. 
I understand some people need to be able to turn these things on but it
sounds like the majority of users don't need it and it will break things
for them. The config option sounds tempting to them though...
In case anyone else is wondering, the commit in question is
http://git.o-hand.com/?p=linux-rpurdie-backlight;a=commitdiff;h=e0e34ef7f02915cfe50e501e9f32c24217177a96
and previously, all the appropriate entries had "depends PMAC_BACKLIGHT"
I think the way forward is going to be to have the backlights disabled
by default at runtime and require enabling through a framebuffer module
parameter. The should be enabled by default in the PMAC_BACKLIGHT case.
Anyone needing it can then pass the appropriate parameter. Does that
sound like the best solution?
Cheers,
Richard
