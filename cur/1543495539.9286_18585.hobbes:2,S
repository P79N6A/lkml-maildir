I think I know what is doing this, but I would like to be certain. The
max-writes-per-cycle choke didn't used to apply to the five-second
writebacks, now it does.  I didn't think that would cause trouble, but
I appear to have been wrong.  Can you please rerun your test after
doing
# echo "40 5000 64 256 5 3000 500 1884 2" >/proc/sys/vm/bdflush
This increases the maximum number of pages to write back per wakeup
from 500 to 5000.
