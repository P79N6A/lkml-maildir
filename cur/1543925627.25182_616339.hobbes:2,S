Hi Andrew,
more than 2 weeks have passed since I posted my six page table patches
to linux-kernel/linux-arch. Nobody complained so far (keeping fingers
crossed..) and Ben has a use for the first two patches on powerpc as
well. Next logical step would be to add the patches that affect common
code to the -mm tree, no?
The three patches in this patchset do apply against your snapshot
broken-out-2007-11-06-02-32.tar.gz. Please add.
