I would say that if they meet the stable criteria, testing time in another
tree is not really necessary.  Stable should be simple bug fixes, easy to
test.  In this case, the fact that Nick seems to think they might need a
run in mm first would tell me that at least some of them probably should
not be in the stable tree at this point.
