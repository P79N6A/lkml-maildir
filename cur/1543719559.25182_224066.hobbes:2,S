on linux-2.6.6, 'make oldconfig' fails on cris with
scripts/kconfig/conf -o arch/cris/Kconfig
arch/cris/Kconfig:158: can't open file "arch/cris/drivers/Kconfig"
make[1]: *** [oldconfig] Error 1
This was reported about a year ago on 2.6.0-test2:	
http://mhonarc.axis.se/dev-etrax/msg03456.html
but it seems nothing has been done about it.
Since step 1 of building a linux kernel for cris seems to have
been dead in the water for almost a year with no
action from the port's maintainer, perhaps the port
should be deleted from the main kernel tree.
Or perhaps the maintainer could submit a fix.  His choice :-)
