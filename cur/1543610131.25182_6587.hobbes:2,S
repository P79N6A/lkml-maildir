IIRC (if wrong flame...)
When you delete an open file, the entry is removed from the directory, but
not unlinked until the file is closed.  This is a standard UNIX semantic.
Now, if you have a set of processes with shared memory, and one closes, and
another is created to replace, the new process will get the new libraries,
or even new version of the process.  This could/will bring down the entire
set of processes.
Apps like samba come to mind...
