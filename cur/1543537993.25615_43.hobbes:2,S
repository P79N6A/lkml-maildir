Hi,
the current /proc structure doesn't provide any info about the following
fact:
I have 2 SCSI drives and 2 SCSI controllers.
Both of them appear in /proc/scsi/scsi with host:x and y.
Both controllers appear also in /proc/bus/pci (or lspci -n).
The info what device (like /dev/sda) is connected to what contoller is
missing.
Is there a way to show this kind of information
(devs device-node -> pci device-node)? 
Something like:
cat /proc/hardware
pci_node="01:00.0" device_node="8.0"
The kernel and the drivers must know that. If I access /dev/sda the data
must go through the driver and then to the correct device. But the info
about that seems to be hidden.
Any hints or patches to display that stuff?
Gruss Olaf
