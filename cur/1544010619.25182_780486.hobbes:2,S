 From over here with a macbook(no serial port as well)
making debugging intricate to the extent.
With running radeon it's weired,
 if I do an echo mem > /sys/power/state
upon wakeup I'll have a black screen,(intranet works)
but if I do a  s2ram "poof" like magic it works.
if using (sorry for the word) fglrx, echo mem
works. haven't tried s2ram with that though.
Aside note glad to see you're running the latest kernel.
for the past week or so there was posts about suspend
but haven't kept up(was busy looking at SELinux refpolicy UBAC)
maybe there was some talks or even some patches submitted
for what you're dealing with?
