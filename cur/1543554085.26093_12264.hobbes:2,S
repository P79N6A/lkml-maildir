hi all,
Sorry, but i could not find a more appropriate group list to post this on. 
my fault in anyways.
I like to keep track of what is installed after each RPM or any other 
install command is performed. Like dates inatlled and who installed it,....  
Like create a log of changes,...
what is the command for it?.  how do i incorporate the date and who command 
into with install command.
J
