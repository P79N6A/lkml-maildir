Subject: [rfc-patch 0/9] Immediate Values for 2.6.24-rc2-git5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/16/256

Here are the updated immediate values following comments. The main changes :
- Declares a packed __immediate section to use less space. Declare the "size" as
  a char instead of an int.
- Simplified x86 immediate values update, spinning with IRQs disabled instead of
  using an lockless update algorithm. Is is simpler, but won't support NMI or
  MCE code updates.
This is submitted for another round of comments.
