And since life is always better with patches... here are two that
do fork and proc/fs/task_mmu. There should be an improvement on archs
like hash-table based ppc32 where flush_tlb_mm() currently has to walk
the page tables, which means an additional walk pass in fork. With this
patch, there will be only one pass, and it will only hit the pages that
have actually been marked RO.
I need to do some proper testing, but in copy to this, I'm posting the
patches anyway for review / comments.
Ben.
