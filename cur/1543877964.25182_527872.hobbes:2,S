I'd almost prefer to just put the zombie children on a separate list. I 
wonder how painful that would be..
That would still make it expensive for people who use WUNTRACED to get 
stopped children (since they'd have to look at all lists), but maybe 
that's not a big deal.
Another thing we could do is to just make sure that kernel threads simply 
don't end up as children of init. That whole thing is silly, they're 
really not children of the user-space init anyway. Comments?
