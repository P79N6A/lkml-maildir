Yep, I use their compiler on Linux.
It depends on the license you buy.
I saw they often ships egcs with their
IDE, i.e. with that kind of programmable
Playstation Sony sells, they give
Codewarrior IDE and gcc hacked for
the Playstation processor. But if you
buy the more expensive option they
give you their compiler, I think...
