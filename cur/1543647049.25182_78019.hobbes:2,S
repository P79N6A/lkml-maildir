Well this is all rather dim in my memory, so the confidence level
is drooping.  I am sure that the timing was a single find | xargs cat
thing.  I also know that I investigated whether the increased time
was due to the metadata access or the data access.  I _think_ it was
mainly metadata.
But it all needs to be redone, really.

Well the current Orlov patch will spread top-level directories,
so as long as /home is a mountpoint, we're fine.
For more generalality, yes, I think a new chattr flag on the
parent directory which says "spread my subdirectories out"
would be a good solution.
