A lot of people mean QP-like semantics when they talk about "RDMA", rather than 
the RDMA operation itself.  I.e. pre-posted receive buffers associated with a 
particular user-space process.
That aside, conceptually, I see little difference between RDMA semantics versus 
the facility that you describe.  The main difference is the complexity of the 
header and the checks done against it.
