Does this fix the warning?  My compiler doesn't show it; of course, I'm not
using gcc-4.3.2, but something older.

KEYS: Fix variable uninitialisation warnings
From: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Fix variable uninitialisation warnings introduced in:
	commit 8bbf4976b59fc9fc2861e79cab7beb3f6d647640
	Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
	Date:   Fri Nov 14 10:39:14 2008 +1100
	KEYS: Alter use of key instantiation link-to-keyring argument
As:
  security/keys/keyctl.c: In function 'keyctl_negate_key':
  security/keys/keyctl.c:976: warning: 'dest_keyring' may be used uninitialized in this function
  security/keys/keyctl.c: In function 'keyctl_instantiate_key':
  security/keys/keyctl.c:898: warning: 'dest_keyring' may be used uninitialized in this function
Some versions of gcc notice that get_instantiation_key() doesn't always set
*_dest_keyring, but fail to observe that if this happens then *_dest_keyring
will not be read by the caller.
