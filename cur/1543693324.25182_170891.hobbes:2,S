Well, I didn't mention the c-word, Pat, you did :-) I would much
rather help figure out the best possible way to implement dentry/inode
ageing in sysfs.

Again, more than customers, it is a question of DTRT.

The overloading kobject argument is much better. Gregkh has also
indicated that non-sysfs kobjects will increase. That definitely
puts things in a different perspective. Fair enough.

Viro's suggestion of pinning the non-leaf dentries only seems like
a very good first alternative to try out.

By not pinning dentries, you save several hundreds of KBs of lowmem
in a common case low-end system with six disks, much reduced number of dentries
in the hash table and huge savings in large systems. I would hope that
is a good argument. Granted you don't like Maneesh's patch as it is now,
but those things will change as more feedbacks come in.
