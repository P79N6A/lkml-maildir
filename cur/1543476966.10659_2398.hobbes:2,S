I apologize for this message, but I feel compelled to state the fact that
I did _not_ send the recent "MAKE MONEY WHILE YOU SLEEP" spam. It appears
to be for/from a company in the USA, was clearly bounced off a machine
somewhere in Spain, and was forged to have my address on it. 
Please don't send me "remove" messages: I didn't send anything in the
first place. 
For anyone who does not want to receive any further mail from linux-kernel
(such as this message), please send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in
the body of a message to majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu. (I am not responsible
for the linux-kernel list, I am merely a participant. If you want to get
off the list, complaining to me can't accomplish anything. Just send the
message to the majordomo.)
For the record, I'm appending the headers of the message, as I received it
on the linux-kernel list.
Also, for the record, I'm seriously pissed at the folks who sent this,
whoever they are.
