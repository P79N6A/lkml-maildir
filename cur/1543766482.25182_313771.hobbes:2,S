I agree that handling this better is a good idea.
But I really hate your is_iret hack in traps.c. Cant you just force the signal
after fixing up the stack? I dont want such a ugly complicated special case 
there that only handles this extremly exotic case.
If you cant do it in a cleaner way it would be better not to fix it.
But I suppose forcing a signal directly is doable.
