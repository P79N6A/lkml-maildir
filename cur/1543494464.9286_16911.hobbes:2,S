Well, I saw that you got some other answers on this one, so I just have
one comment to make: the mca-pentium option is removed in the v2.2.x
kernels, so you don't need to specify it. If you experience trouble with
PS/2's with a pentium, use no-hlt instead; it basically does the same
thing. However, unless there are any troubles (freeze on bootup), don't
use that option. Not all pentium-processors have this problem.
