Yeap, it probably won't hit 2MB in common cases but it still needs to
scale for uncommon cases and if 4K TLB pressure becomes too high for
such cases, promoting to 2MB TLB makes sense for those.  IIUC, that's
what Christoph Lameter is intending to do (haven't looked at the code
yet tho).

I don't know.  I think it's a dangerous thing which can be avoided.
If there's no other solution, then we might have to live with it but I
don't see the winning benefit of such design over per-cpu virtual
mapping.
Thanks.
