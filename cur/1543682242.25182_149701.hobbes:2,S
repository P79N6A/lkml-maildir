Well, the only part which comes from this patch is:
<para>
If you have comments on the formatting of this manpage, then please contact
Michael Still (mikal\@stillhq.com).
</para>
<para>
This documentation was generated with kernel version $ARGV[2].
</para>
I can shorten this if people would like.
The GPL bit people have commented on is actually extracted from the front
matter of the SGML file being converted inside
<legalnotice></legalnotice>. Therefore, if the SGML kerneldoc output we
already have includes the GPL, then so does the man page. I have not
imposed new license conditions on the documentation.
If people are comfortable with dropping the legal notice, or perhaps 
inserting a line saying "refer to file X for the license on this 
documentation", then I'll do that and send a new patch.
Cheers,
Mikal
