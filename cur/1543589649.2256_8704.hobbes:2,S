It's neither.
It's a cookie that you can do arithmetic off and pass on to the
readx/writex, and nothing more. You cannot make any assumptions at all
about what it means.
In particular, you can _not_ assume that it is a PCI bus address ("WHICH
bus?") and you can absolutely not assume that it is a CPU address (many
CPU's do not "memory map" PCI at all).
