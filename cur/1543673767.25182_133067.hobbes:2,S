And even there futexes are (a) faster and (b) smaller than SYSVIPC. So 
assuming you ever want threading in an embedded world (not unlikely at 
all, since things like DVD playback etc are mostly done with threads), you 
want futexes.

Yes. We can make tit a CONFIG option, and then force it to always be "y" 
in the .config file. And then the people who really know and really care 
can turn the "y" to a "n".
