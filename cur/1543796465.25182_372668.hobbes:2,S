    E.  You send a _minimal_ patch against lastest mm, telling me
       "this fixes a bug in
       cpuset-change-marker-for-relative-numbering.patch".  Then I insert
       it into the series with name
       cpuset-change-marker-for-relative-numbering-fix.patch and it gets
       folded into cpuset-change-marker-for-relative-numbering.patch prior
       to going to Linus.
Usually people forget to tell me which patch it fixes, but I work it out.
In this case, dropping cpuset-change-marker-for-relative-numbering.patch
works fine too - it took 20 seconds to fix up the rejects.  Mainly by
simply omitting them, because all this stuff:
***************

  	.cpus_allowed = CPU_MASK_ALL,
  	.mems_allowed = NODE_MASK_ALL,
  	.marker_pid = 0,
- 	.fmeter.cnt = 0,
- 	.fmeter.val = 0,
- 	.fmeter.time = 0,
  	.count = ATOMIC_INIT(0),
  	.sibling = LIST_HEAD_INIT(top_cpuset.sibling),
  	.children = LIST_HEAD_INIT(top_cpuset.children),

It just redundant - the compiler does that.

Your call.  E is preferred though.
