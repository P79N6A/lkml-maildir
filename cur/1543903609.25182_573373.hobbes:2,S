There are multiple bus resets happening while fw-sbp2 tries to log in.
Normally I would say that this is a sign of an electrically unstable
bus.  But since the old drivers don't show anything like that at all,
there must be problems in the new drivers.

Here even the device fw1 vanished from fw-core's point of view, then
came back.

Are you sure the FireWire controller is from VIA?  Check with lscpi.
The NVidia nForce2 chipset has an own FireWire controller, and that one
is only "supported" by a gross hack in ohci1394 and at the moment
unsupported in firewire-ohci.  There is even a bug report in Red Hat's
bugzilla where fw-ohci hung up when trying to initialize an nForce2 chip.

Which controller does this other PC have?
BTW, the GUID of the host in the above ieee1394 log is from Albatron
Technology, and th GUID of the disk is from Prolific Technology, Inc.
Some (many?) Prolific based devices were and maybe still are sold with
outdated buggy firmware.
