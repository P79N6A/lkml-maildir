I tried (using pmtools-20031210 and acpica-unix-20050513):
acpidmp > c840.dmp
acpixtract dsdt c840.dmp > c840.dsdt
acpixtract ssdt c840.dmp > c840.ssdt
iasl -d c840.dsdt
iasl -d c840.ssdt
No signs of a _CST in either the DSDT or SSDT (in fact, xtract ssdt got me a
zero-length file, so I suspect there's no SSDT at all in there).
Oh well.. looks like short of BIOS/DSDT hacking, I'm stuck.  At least the
dynamic tick code got some testing out of all this... ;)
