2.6.11.7 has no significant changes that should effect your touchpad.
We'll need much more information to make any headway here (see
REPORTING-BUGS).  I've got a Toshiba laptop, and have no issues with the
touchpad.  I assume this is an issue in just in X.  Do you see any obvious
difference in the Xorg.0.log when starting X on the two different kernels?
Any interesting dmesg output on the failing kernel?  Does booting with
psmouse.proto=exps help (assuming you have CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2=y)?
thanks,
