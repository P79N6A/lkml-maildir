That's all obsolete with udev, it creates persistent name entries on
first device discovery, and keeps them forever.
You can edit the automatically created/updated udev rules, if you want
different names, but by default there is no intervention needed to
have stable network device names out of the box, regardless of any
kernel module loading/linking order or whatever.
