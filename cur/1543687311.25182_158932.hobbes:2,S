Hmm.. depends what you mean by "consistent"... "you can implement the
insides either way as long as the outsides look the same", or "you can do it
either way, as long as you do it the same way throughout the network".
The problem is that the *externally visible* behavior is different depending on
whether you choose host or interface ownership, and either model can probably
be made to work if *the rest of the network plays along*.
