Yeah, that was a concern and I'm relatively sure that's not the case because
*) chkrootkit says so (mod some hidden processes that are reported by a bug in
 chkrootkit according to Google)
*) The crashy boxes were all installed with 2.4.23, not upgraded, so the big
 Debian vulnerability didn't exist
*) The only open ports to the outside world are running SMTP and POP3 as
 non-root no-shell accounts, and it's running qmail which seems simple and
 safe enough.
