That's not really a user space limitation, but a kernel `bug'.
I.e. it could be solved in the kernel if larger ioremap()s would be allowed, or
if some sliding window mapping would be used. User space shouldn't need to know
about this.

That would make sure this stays in-kernel, but my other reasoning stays the
same: it's some kind of kernel bug.
