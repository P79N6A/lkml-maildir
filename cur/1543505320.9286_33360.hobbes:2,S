We are going to attempt a transfer from a SCO Xenix system to our Linux
2.2.5 via UUCP using a serial rs232 connection hardwired from a 24 pin on
the Xenix side to a 9 pin on the Linux side.  How do we get fstab to
recognize the 800mg transfer?  We were hoping to make the transfer as a
Xenix filesystem.  Thus far we have been unable to get Linux to recognize
anything Xenix.  Any help will be greatly appreciated as this is a system
criticle transfer for our company.
