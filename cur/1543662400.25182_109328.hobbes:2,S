Yes, if they issue commands via the mid-layer.  This one is queueing a
message (encapsulated as a pseudo command) on it's internal queue (which
is a cmd queue) to issue a bus device reset.  In this instance, it
cannot use the request based interface because the device will be
in_recovery when this happens, so it would never be issued.
Personally, it would be nice to have a messaging interface to get around
these problems, but I don't think that one's coming any time soon...
