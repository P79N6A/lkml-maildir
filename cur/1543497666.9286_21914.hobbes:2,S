What Linus is asking for is actually sort of the inverse of a point
enabler.  It isn't enabling the device at all: it just needs to query
the existing configuration.  Point enablers need to deal with resource
conflicts, read card configuration data, etc.  This just assumes that
all those things were already dealt with.
