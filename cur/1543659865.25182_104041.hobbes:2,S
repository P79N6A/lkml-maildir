Close, but is doesn't do it quite for me. I understand the problem of 
traversing inodes back up the tree, once they have changed, to see 
whether someone wants to receive an event. However I am not convinced 
that this is necessary. The idea I had was the following:
I would like to have a passthrough kind of filesystem (lets call is myfs 
for now) that can mount other parts of the filesystem and just maps 
everything to the original tree. For instance, I would mount /var on 
/mnt/var, using myfs. Everything from /mnt/var is directly mapped to 
/var.
The clue of this is that myfs *knows* about the notification, because it 
has to send notification to userspace for *every* inode. So if anything 
is written in /mnt/var, it can notify userspace. BTW for my app it 
would be acceptable that direct changes in /var don't lead to any 
events.
I haven't thought out the interface to userspace yet, but I think that 
can be worked out. Let me know if I'm making any sense here.
