This _could_ happen in past - as the matter of fact, I can reproduce it
on any 2.4 kernel.  Mount something over the root of already mounted
filesystem and watch the show.
Now, we could disable showing rootfs in /proc/mounts and it might be a
good idea for 2.4,  I'm not all that sure that it's a right thing, though.
