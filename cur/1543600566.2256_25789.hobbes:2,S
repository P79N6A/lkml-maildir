Are you claiming that the USB controller IRQ line isn't routed to the
APIC?  If so, I'm curious as to any evidence you can provide to that
effect.
I'd appreciate a pointer to any discussion or whatnot.  URL?  Or even a
suggestion for where to search?  I think I've looked pretty
thoroughly...
But looking at noapic mode a bit more closely, it appears likely that I
can survive with its limitations, so thanks for the tip!
