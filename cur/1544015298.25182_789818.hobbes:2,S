Thank you, glad to be of service.  Should I have picked an example where
the code becomes horribly convoluted and there is nothing you can do
about it?
But since I am clearly the newbie, could you try to teach my stupid ass
instead of just ridiculing it?  What is the thing that makes a read only
filesystem special?  And why does everyone believe that I am arguing
against merging squashfs when I'm not?
