It looks like you have a confuzed source file.  Did you download the
kernel tarball or apply bk patches or apply cvs patches or what?
These errors make no sense for 2.6.0-test8.  The messages are not
correct for that kernel version.
Also, I have built it successfully.
If you continue to have these errors after checking the source file,
please send me your .config file.
Maybe compare your fs/udf/super.c file to the one here:
