Subject: [GIT PATCH] ACPI patches for 2.6.25-rc5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi Linus,
please pull from: 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git release
A bunch of small regression fixes, bug fixes, and a couple of minor cleanups.
FYI, some notes on the larger text changes:
Documentation/* moves some files around to complete a change
we started earlier in 2.6.25.
thermal.c updates the I/F we added in 2.6.25-rc1 to look how hwmon wants it.
pci_irq.c provides some DMI workarounds for interrupt related BIOS bugs.
snapshot.c fixes a hibernation regression (though it broke back in 2.6.22)
acer-wmi.c tweaks a driver that is new in 2.6.25-rc1 with some DMI hooks.
This will update the files shown below.
thanks!
-Len
ps. individual patches are available on linux-acpi@vger.kernel.org
and a consolidated plain patch is available here:

    ACPI: add _PRT quirks to work around broken firmware
    
    This patch works around incorrect _PRT (PCI interrupt routing)
    information from firmware.  This does not fix any regressions
    and can wait for the next kernel release.
    
    On the Medion MD9580-F laptop, the BIOS says the builtin RTL8139
    NIC interrupt at 00:09.0[A] is connected to \_SB.PCI0.ISA.LNKA, but
    it's really connected to \_SB.PCI0.ISA.LNKB.  Before this patch,
    the workaround was to use "pci=routeirq".  More details at
    
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4773.
    
    On the Dell OptiPlex GX1, the BIOS says the PCI slot interrupt
    00:0d[A] is connected to LNKB, but it's really connected to LNKA.
    Before this patch, the workaround was to use "pci=routeirq".
    Pierre Ossman tested a previous version of this patch and confirmed
    that it fixed the problem.  More details at
    
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5044.
    
    On the HP t5710 thin client, the BIOS says the builtin Radeon
    video interrupt at 01:00[A] is connected to LNK1, but it's really
    connected to LNK3.  The previous workaround was to use a custom
    DSDT.  I tested this patch and verified that it fixes the problem.

    Hibernation: Fix mark_nosave_pages()
    
    There is a problem in the hibernation code that triggers on some NUMA
    systems on which pfn_valid() returns 'true' for some PFNs that don't
    belong to any zone.  Namely, there is a BUG_ON() in
    memory_bm_find_bit() that triggers for PFNs not belonging to any
    zone and passing the pfn_valid() test.  On the affected systems it
    triggers when we mark PFNs reported by the platform as not saveable,
    because the PFNs in question belong to a region mapped directly using
    iorepam() (i.e. the ACPI data area) and they pass the pfn_valid()
    test.
    
    Modify memory_bm_find_bit() so that it returns an error if given PFN
    doesn't belong to any zone instead of crashing the kernel and ignore
    the result returned by it in mark_nosave_pages(), while marking the
    "nosave" memory regions.
    
    This doesn't affect the hibernation functionality, as we won't touch
    the PFNs in question anyway.

    integrated LCD is present and supports brightness level .The _BQC is
    the optional object. So the _BQC object is ignored when the backlight device
    is registered in ACPI video driver.

    ACPI: WMI: Clean up handling of spec violating data blocks
    
    Acer violate the ACPI-WMI spec by declaring some of their data blocks as
    expensive, but with no corresponding WCxx method. There is already some
    workaround code in to handle the initial WCxx call (we just ignore a
    failure here); but we need to properly check if the second, "clean up",
    WCxx call is actually needed or not, rather than fail simply because it
    isn't there.

    acer-wmi: Rename mail LED correctly & remove hardcoded colour
    
    The mail LED name for acer-wmi currently hardcodes in the colour as green.
    This is wrong, since many of the newer laptops now come with an orange
    LED, and we have no way of telling what colour is used on a given system.
    
    Also, rename the mail LED to be inline with the current recommendations of
    the LED class documentation.

    toshiba_acpi: Enable autoloading
    
    This adds aliases to enable autoloading of toishiba_acpi.  Two aliases are
    defined - TOS6200 (for \\_SB_.VALD.GHCI) and TSO1900 (for \\_SB_.VALZ.GHCI).
    This allows toishiba_acpi to be autoloaded on systems that provide those
    devices.

    ACPI: EC: Handle IRQ storm on Acer laptops
    
    On some Acer systems, the HW fails to clear the GPE source,
    causing an interrupt storm.
    
    So in EC interrupt mode, we count how many interrupts we
    receive when waiting.  If we get more than 5, we give
    up on interrupt mode and revert to polling mode.
    
    Also, for polling mode to work on Acers, we need
    to insert a delay.

    ACPI Exception (): AE_NOT_FOUND, Processor Device is not present (update)
    
    update cfaf3747ff3d431fba33f75083b7f50f58ae22ff
    ACPI: ACPI Exception (): AE_NOT_FOUND, Processor Device is not present
    
    is_processor_present is only called in the processor hotplug case,
    and _STA method is mandatory at this time.
    
    We should ignore those processors that are disabled in the MADT
    and don't have _STA methods.
    Because they will never exist in this system.
    For the processors that don't physically exist but can be
    hot plugged later, we still need this debug info.

    ACPI: acpi_pci_set_power_state() cleanups
    
    Minor cleanups to acpi_pci_set_power_state():  use the ACPI and PCI
    state symbols to make clear that a mapping is being done between PCI
    and ACPI states, instead of using magic numbers.  For paranoia's sake,
    report any errors.  Save five bytes (x86_64) too.

    ACPI: prevent randconfig build failure on empty ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT_FILE
    
    Make ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT boolean config symbol a hidden and derived
    value, based on the value of ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT_FILE (string).
    Only the latter is presented to the user as a config option.
    
    This fixes problems with "make randconfig" setting ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT
    but leaving ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT_FILE empty/blank.

    Remove __exit annotation from acer_backlight_exit(). We cannot reference
    a __exit annotated function from non __exit functions.
    
    acer_led_init() and acer_backlight_init() where both annotated __init but
    used from a __devinit function. This would result in an oops should
    gcc drop their inlining and the module are hot plugged.
    
    Fix by annotating acer_led_init() and acer_backlight_init() __devinit.
