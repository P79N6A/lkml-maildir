No, no problem.  A multipath write barrier can be handled by blocking incoming 
writes in the target and waiting for all outstanding writes to complete.  I'd 
prefer to let the write barrier flow down the pipe to the SCSI disk if I 
could, but there are technical challenges.  Mainly I need to know if an 
ordered write is able to read its buffer into the drive's cache while it is 
waiting for preceding commands to complete; if so it would be worth putting 
the effort into developing the flow-through scheme.
