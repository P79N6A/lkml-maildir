Hi Jamie,
I am currently using an MMC card via usb with a SanDisk SDDR-33 reader.
I can use either MMC cards or SD cards using the sddr09 driver in
usb/storage. All I had to do was mount -t msdos /dev/sda1 /mnt. But your
post sent me scurrying through that code and I looked at unusual_devs.h
and noticed that sddr-33 was not mentioned, but sddr-31, -09 etc were.
 I'd love to have an MMC slot in place of my floppy drive.
