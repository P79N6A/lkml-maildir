OK, I missed that.  It seems a bit bogus to me.  Could you point me at
where in the code this happens?

The not holding any decent data is a consequence of the device nodes
getting thrown away, isn't it?  I fail to see how resetting the device
can of itself affect our copy of the device tree.

Which get run in keventd's context.  In other words no other
workqueues will get run during the 5 second sleep, or at least not on
that cpu.
