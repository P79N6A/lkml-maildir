That's sounds like a sensible approach, though not entirely sure how it
will work out in
practice.  Guess there is only one way to find out!

It maps fine, particularly as quite a few daughter boards have local (be
it static)
regulators to ensure clean supplies etc.

Sure, I guess in cases where the requirements are board specific rather
than driven by the chip, some
means of overriding the defaults may be necessary.  Not something that
we will want to add to drivers
unless actually needed.

Yup, though in many cases they have different part numbers etc and can
be handled via multiple
driver registrations or alias provisions such as in i2c.  This is how
things like adc's with differing
numbers of inputs depending on precise model are handled anyway.

I think so. Guess it's going to be a case of trying out an example and
seeing how it goes.
Thanks,
