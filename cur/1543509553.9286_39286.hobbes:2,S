what is the status of the PCMCIA merge? I can't seem to get 2.3.18ac4 to
compile on my laptop, and it's barfing on the pcmcia code in
drivers/pcmcia (i have it trying to compile in, and not as a module). 
After changing some things in the makefile in that directory, it compiled
and built a pcmcia_core.o file.  But on linking the entire kernel, it
seemed to be looking for a pcmcia.o file in that directory which does not
exist. Haven't tried it as a module yet....
Any pointers? Alan?
