Here is an updated patch for missing pci_disable_device().
Greg, please apply.
Thanks,
Kenji Kaneshige
As mentioned in Documentaion/pci.txt, pci device driver should call
pci_disable_device() when it decides to stop using the device. But
there are some drivers that don't use pci_disable_device() so far.
This patch adds warning messages that are displayed if the device is
removed without properly calling pci_disable_device().
'WARN_ON(1)' is commented out for now because I guess many people
(including some distros) enables 'CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL'. People might
be surprised if many stack dumps are displayed on their console.
