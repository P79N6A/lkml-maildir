$ fdisk -l /dev/sda
Disk /dev/sda: 1 heads, 35843670 sectors, 1 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 35843670 * 512 bytes
   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1   *         1         1     32098+  83  Linux
Partition 1 has different physical/logical beginnings (non-Linux?):
     phys=(0, 1, 1) logical=(0, 0, 64)
Partition 1 has different physical/logical endings:
     phys=(3, 254, 63) logical=(0, 0, 64260)
Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary:
     phys=(3, 254, 63) should be (3, 0, 35843670)
/dev/sda2             1         1    168682+  83  Linux
Partition 2 has different physical/logical beginnings (non-Linux?):
     phys=(4, 0, 1) logical=(0, 0, 64261)
Partition 2 has different physical/logical endings:
     phys=(24, 254, 63) logical=(0, 0, 401625)
Partition 2 does not end on cylinder boundary:
     phys=(24, 254, 63) should be (24, 0, 35843670)
....
One head, one cylinder and lots of sectors??
I put some debug in drivers/scsi/scsicam.c and it doesn't
seem like it was called.
Is my fdisk (from RH 7.2) too old?
