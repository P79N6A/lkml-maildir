Al, you write:

This predates me by a while, but I suspect that it is done this way on
the assumption it is easier to seek forward on the disk while reading
a file rather than seeking backwards.  Also, since with new inodes the
goal is initially the first block of the group where the inode lives,
the blocks at the start of a group will generally be allocated already,
so it is usually a waste of time checking the start of the group for
free blocks.
Cheers, Andreas
