I would love to see something like this as well (the fact that we zero
out the indirect blocks on truncate/unlink has always bothered me).
However, the thing that scares me about this is that this means we now
have to maintain *two* horribly complicated pieces of code for which
it will be very easy for bugs to creep in.  
This would be a prime candidate for trying to add the same sort of
userspace test framework which Rusty and company did for netfilter, so
we can try to test for race conditions, corner cases, etc.
