The quick answer is the qp_list is traversed w/o the lock held in
ipath_ib_rcv().  The intent is to be able to do a lookup on the GID
to get a reference to the struct ipath_mcast and then walk the qp_list
w/o locks being held while processing the received packets at
interrupt level.

Its not really. I'm just trying to be consistent where ever the
qp_list is traversed.

The lock free traversal is in ipath_ib_rcv() which is an interrupt
routine.
