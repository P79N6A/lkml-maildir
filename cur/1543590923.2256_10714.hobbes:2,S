I want to create a new block device - it is a different interface to
the software-raid code that allows the arrays to be partitioned using
normal partition tables.
So I need a major number - to give to devfs_register_blkdev at least.
You don't want me to have a hardcoded one (which is fine) so I need a
dynamically allocated one - yes?
This means that we need some analogue to {get,put}_unnamed_dev that
manages a range of dynamically allocated majors.
Is there such a beast already, or does someone need to write it?
What range(s) should be used for block devices? 
Am I missing something obvious here?
