I have no scsi problems or errors at all, apart from about 2hrs into my
monthly four hour backup of all the machines on my network I get errors

etc. ( I don't have logs for latest incident as they were lost in the
crash)
This happens when it is reading from VFAT partition on the IBM disk to ide
tape. My latest suspect is vfat, but I just got the problem again with the
fat-patch-16 patch in.
I have also had it happen when reading SMBFS from the network to the ide
tape.
It works perfectly every time with kernel 2.0.36.
So maybe a strange interaction between the 2.2,x scsi driver and the IBM
disk? Or the ide tape driver fouling up the bus?
