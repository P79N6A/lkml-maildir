I posed this earlier and got no response.  The OSS driver is really
bad.  It has hisses and crackles. OSS guys are working on it.  I really
would like to know what the status is?
               I read that Alan Cox was working on an ESS Maestro sound
driver at

                             I get a lot of people with ESS maestro
cards asking
                         me about the state of the Maestro driver.
                             Maestro.c in 2.2.9ac4 is most of a driver,
it needs
                         the mixer writing and it needs fixing so the
                             DMA ring buffer works right. I've simply
not had
                             time to do this. I don't expect to have
time to
                             finish it in the near future either.
Various people
                         have asked about taking it over - feel free but
if
                   you do please let people on
                             linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu
                             know so that we get one Maestro
                             project.
               Does anyone know the progress of this? ...
               I would really like to try the new driver. Sound is the
only thing
               keeping my Windows partition around (I could use the disk
space!)
