What Linux implementation?  Linux as a client of this interface?  So
everyone implements as much of the ABI as needed to get Linux to boot?
We have an excellent example of how well that model works.  Thousands of
BIOS implementations all implementing just enough of the various BIOS
interfaces to get Windows to boot.  And then all fall over as soon as
you try to be non-Windows, or even a later version of Windows.  It's the
path to being absolutely inundated with legacy crap.
You're arguing that we should have a single hypervisor ABI in order to,
among other things, reduce the test matrix, and yet the ABI is entirely
defined by testing to see how well a given implementation runs some
random version of Linux.  And if Linux wants to use that interface in a
different way, everyone is supposed to magically keep up.
And all this is supposed to be managed by multiple disparate independent
out-of-tree implementations?
Yep, I want a pony too.

OK.  How does that help with "not hindering Linux's development"?
