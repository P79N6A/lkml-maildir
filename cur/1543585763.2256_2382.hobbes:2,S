The year is 2006.  IBM's latest supercluster has 1000 boxes, each with 4
x 8-way SMT processors running at 1THz.  Dense optical interconnect
provides NUMA-style cache coherency, and the entire system runs like a
giant SMP box (using kernel data structure replication).  Each active
thread is able to clone() 500,000,000 threads per second, in a pid space
shared throughout the cluster.
A virus arrives containing while(1){clone();}
Engineers observe pid wraparound approximately 2 weeks later :-)
