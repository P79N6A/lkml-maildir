pci_present() should be killed.  It's left over from 2.0 or 1.2 days, 
and has no meaning anymore.
The old-kernel use was to determine if a PCI bus.  Drivers had to check 
if a PCI bus was present, before probing for a PCI device using the 
old-old find-by-slot-and-busid method of PCI bus probing.  As the 
now-old method of PCI bus probing (pci_find_device) and the current PCI 
API both provide correct behavior when no PCI bus is present, 
pci_present() itself no longer has any meaning and is entirely redundant.
At the very least, we should use the gcc "deprecated" attribute on 
pci_present definitions, both normal and no-op.
IMO pci_present should go before 2.6.0...  it's lived long enough.
