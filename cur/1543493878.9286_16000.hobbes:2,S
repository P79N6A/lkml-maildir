WHAT kernel?!
You may have a hardware problem, depends on what kernel you have... If
it's 2.0.36, for example, I bet it's the hardware.
By the way, please reconfigure your mail program, there's no such
character set "Windows-1252":
    [ The following text is in the "Windows-1252" character set. ]
    [ Your display is set for the "ISO-8859-1" character set.  ]
    [ Some characters may be displayed incorrectly. ]
