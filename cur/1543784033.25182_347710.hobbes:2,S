Subject: [PATCH] Make ide-cs work for hardware with 8-bit CF-Interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
it is technically possible to access a CF-Card with an 8-bit width bus.
The problem with the current code is that the IDE code does a 16 (or 32) 
bit read on the IDE data register. If the bus interface for a 8-bit bus 
would then do two reads to offsets 0 and 1.
The second read (to offset 1) then reads the error register instead of 
the data register's odd byte.
To fix this problem I've changed the ide-cs code to use the duplicated 
data registers at offset 8 and 9 which are not overlapped with anything.
According to the specs, those registers should be there in every CF 
card. I've tested this with a couple of CFs, including SanDisk, 
Microdrive and several NoNames.
The specific architechture I'm using this on is a AT91RM9200 with kernel 
2.6.13 and the patches from 
http://maxim.org.za/AT91RM9200/2.6/.
For more information on the overlapped / non-overlapped registers see 
http://www.compactflash.org/cfspc3_0.pdf
 - page 96
The following patch is against vanilla 2.6.13.
