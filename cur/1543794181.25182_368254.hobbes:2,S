Ye...I know of tee.
But the issue here is I have a HUGE Compiler (an Simulation tool) in which thousands of places there are "printf" statements to print messages to STDOUT stream. Now, a requirement came up which needs all those messages thrown to STDOUT also to be logged in a LOGFILE (in addition to STDOUT). Yes, this can be done through tee...but the usage model of the compiler doesn't leave that possibility open for me. 
So, am looking for a solution inside the Compiler code.
Thanks,
Arijit

It's a userspace problem. man "tee".
Doing this in the kernel would be horrible.
