Sticking a Gigabit Ethernet driver into 2.0.x is silly, yes you can
get it running but it is not going to work very well nor at decent
speeds. I thought about porting the driver back to 2.0.x, but then
2.2.x was released and I decided it was not worth the effort.
However, upgrading an older system to a 2.2 compatible level, Red Hat
in fact released the necessary RPMS - so the problem is non existant.
