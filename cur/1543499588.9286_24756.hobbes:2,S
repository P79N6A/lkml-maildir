I'll merge in the new fsync code.  I'm not sure I'll bother using the
inode page list: it doesn't deal with metadata, so we still need a
separate per-inode dirty buffer list anyway.  Given that, it may turn
out to be simpler just to use that one list for all the dirty blocks.
Once that's back in, restoring the O_SYNC in ext2_file_write becomes
really trivial.
