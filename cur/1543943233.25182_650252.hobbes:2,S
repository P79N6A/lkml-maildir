First would be to see if you could get a sysrq-t dump of the blocked
process. I'm curious if yours would point to the same spot.
Also, could you describe how to reproduce it, given that you managed to
have it reproducable enough to bisect, I'd say you have a good case.
I installed gnome-terminal, started it and wiggled it about while doing
find / - that didn't manage to get it to lock up - but I'll try again if
that is the right way.
