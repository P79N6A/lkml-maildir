No kidding! Deal with it.

The draft is not pure capabilities. You are using the wrong terms again.
a. pure capabilities     Something insane, with NO FILESYSTEM NAMESPACE
b. POSIX draft           Linux and other systems mostly support this

There should be very few of these. Normal users don't get such processes.

The default is (and always must be) traditional UNIX behavior.

The draft specifies how capabilities should work. You call this "lenient",
but it is far more strict than the existing system.
I propose two things:
1. per-bit selection of traditional and draft behavior
2. David's bit set that reduces pI content
Without reasonable compatibility, we will _never_ see a Linux distribution
with enhanced security features. (meaning Debian, Red Hat, etc.)

Nope, because you don't let fI and pI work as they should. You have to
set fP bits on /bin/mv and add some kind of user checking to /bin/mv too.

Nope, that is crap. An admin's shell might have nothing in pP, so you
would need to set fP bits on damn near everything.
