Fork+exec is adequately optimized for.  Fork+100 execs is supremely well
optimized for.  I'm entirely satisfied with the way the performance looks
at this point, it will outdo anything we've seen to date.  With Linus's
write-protect-in-page-directory optimization there's not a lot more fat
to be squeezed out, if any, and even without it, it will be a screamer.
I think we've done this one, it's time to move on from here.
