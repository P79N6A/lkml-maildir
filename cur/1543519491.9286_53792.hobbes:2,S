Hi folks,
I got strange debug messages when i write to control pipe of my
usb ethernet device. It looks like:
requested 4 bytes, got 0
I said strange because the registers are modified corectly, while
the message make me think there is problem.
I have two bulk pipes and still can't find out which one of
bulk functions to chose (usb_bulk_msg or request_bulk), which
is more suitable for a network driver.
regards,
Petkan
