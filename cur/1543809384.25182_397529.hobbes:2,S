Well it may make userspace portability slightly easier for this
one case (exactly how, I'm not so sure because each architecture
has their own MADV_ defines anyway). I rather think this should
be left up to arch maintainers' numbering schemes, but...

0x30 and 0x31 broke parisc's numbering scheme.

I probably would have assumed it had gone past arch maintainers
and so wouldn't have given it a second thought: I don't know a
great deal about the issues here. I just now happened to see the
parisc comment.
But no harm done this time.
