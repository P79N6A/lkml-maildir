Hello,
      I recently compiled the 2.4.2 with usb support.
I also brought a ethernet card based on the 8139too.o
driver. When i insert the module, the following 
message keeps blurting out:
kernel: uhci: host controller halted. very bad
kernel: uhci: host controller halted. very bad
kernel: uhci: host controller halted. very bad
.
.
.
this happens only when i insert the 8139too module.
else the usb works fine, and detects the usb
devices. Is there anything i am missing or should be
doing... Any help or suggestions would be very 
helpful.
Thanks.
srimg.
