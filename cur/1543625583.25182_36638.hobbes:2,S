I have 2.5 kgdb stub patches too.  Various versions can be discovered
by poking around in 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/
The version I use is a bit thinner than Amit's - I took out the
assertion checks from various places because they cause patching pain.
The assertion mechanism is still there, but the *uses* of it I took
out.
Of course, I may not be feature- or bugfix-current against Amit's
version.
