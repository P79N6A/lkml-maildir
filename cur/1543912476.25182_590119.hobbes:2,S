Yes, well, but no. The location code is useful as a geographical
location: slots and devices are physically labelled with stickers 
so you can tell which is which.  Handy when you have to unplug stuff. 
By contrast, the device-tree full_name is mostly just gobldy-gook, 
with some crazy phb numbering in there that, after four years of 
staring at them, I still can't reliably do anything useful with.  
Location codes are nice.
