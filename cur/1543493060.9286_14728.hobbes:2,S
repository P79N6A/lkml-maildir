I think the latest ping will produce 90% packet loss on a flood to
localhost. This was some kind of 'feature' (a side-effect) introduced
around 2.2.x (Alan responded to this). As I understand it, ICMP replies
are delayed by a HZ, so the maximum response-rate is 100/second. Ping
flood tries 1000/second so you lose the flood-game.
