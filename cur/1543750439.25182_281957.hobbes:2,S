Yes, I got exactly the same - hard locked, nothing in logs.
I got this from screen:
kswapd exited with prempt-count 1
Kernel Panic - not syncing: fatal exception in interrupt.
My box has one IDE drive... and is gateway for my LAN using IPTABLES/NAT/MASQ.
The crash happened everytime I finished playing quake2 and quit the client.
I have gone back to 2.6.4 at the moment - the only kernel I can get to run 
24/7/365 without a kswapd oops.
I am still sussing why/wtf.
Nick
