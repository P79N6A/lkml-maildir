I think we're going to need to wait for John to comment. His last
comment on this patch was in agreement as long as it solved the churn
issue (as of Aug. 4 on LKML).

It's not mandatory, it's just preferred.. As I said above, to avoid
churn. I don't like the churn at boot up, and I tried to make sure there
was none added in the patch set.
