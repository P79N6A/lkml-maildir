Please do...
Those patches are not going to be submitted for the current merge 
window, as I had higher priorities.  The PCI hotplug conversion is 
complete, but a few "rough edges" remain to be cleaned up -- then we 
must test, since none of this work is tested at all yet.
For anyone else curious about the ISDN PCI hotplug API conversion, it is 
available on the 'isdn-pci' branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/misc-2.6.git
