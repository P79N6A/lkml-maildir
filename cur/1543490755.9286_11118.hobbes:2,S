Hi,
This is either a bug or the behavior of things have changed.  If the
programming interface has changed, could someone let me know how I can
lock this thing properly.
It seems on Linux 2.0, only one process can have the dsp device open, with
2.2 however, it silently lets you open the device even if it's busy.  It
will block until the first process closes.
Example:
Linux 2.0.36
viper:/dev$ cat >dsp0&
[1] 11539
viper:/dev$ cat >dsp0&
[2] 11540
[1]+  Stopped                 cat >dsp0
viper:/dev$ bash: dsp0: Device or resource busy
fg 1
cat >dsp0
[2]   Exit 1                  cat >dsp0
viper:/dev$
Linux 2.2.3:
continuum:/dev$ cat >dsp0&
[1] 20643
continuum:/dev$ cat >dsp0&
[2] 20644
continuum:/dev$ cat >dsp0&
[3] 20645
continuum:/dev$
No error.  It this right?
