Your error message seems to indicate that lockd is having a hard time
looking up the name of the client (if I read the code
correctly). Normally lockd does this by using the knfsd dictionar
rather than keeping a map of its own.
If the 'unmount' message came before the lockd message, then that
could explain things: it could be the NT client is unmounting the
partition before releasing the file locks.
Cheers,
