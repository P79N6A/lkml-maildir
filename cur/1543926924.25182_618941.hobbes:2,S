Sounds like CFSD has a bug w.r.t. what fsid it returns to the client.

Wrong. It applies to all mountpoint crossing. If the server tells us
that the fsid has changed, then we create a new mountpoint.

Prior to 2.6.21-rc5, we had a bug in register_nfs_fs() whereby it failed
to register the sysctl table unless you enabled NFSv4.

Why should it? The current behaviour is quite correct. If you cross a
mountpoint, then you should remount in order to ensure that the inode
numbers remain unique per-filesystem.
We know that some ancient NFS servers had problems returning the correct
fsid in readdirplus replies, so 2.6.22 adds support to disable
readdirplus calls via a 'nordirplus' mount option. I guess you could try
that...
