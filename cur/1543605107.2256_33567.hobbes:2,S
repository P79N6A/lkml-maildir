I could add a sysctl to control that. In short the change consists of
making the DEF_PRIORITY in mm/vmscan.c a variable rather than a
preprocessor #define. That's the "ratio" number I was talking about in
the last email to Rik, and if you read ac/mm/vmscan.c you'll find it
there too indeed.
That's basically the only number that I left in the code, everything
else should be completly dynamic behaviour. Anyways also this number
isn't critical, as said it shouldn't make an huge difference anyways,
but yes it could be tunable.
However one of the reasons I didn't do that I still believe the vm
should be autotuning and provide behaviour with concepts, not with
random tweaking. But I cannot imagine at the moment how to make even
such fixed number to go away :), so at the moment it could make some
sense to make it a sysctl.
The probe of the cache that allows me to swapouts before we really
failed shrinking the cache doesn't sounds like random tweaking either to
me (maybe I'm biased 8), it instead allows to free memory and swapout at
the very same time, and this seems beneficial.
