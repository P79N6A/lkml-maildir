Hello!

Olaf, all these protocols exist, well-defined, documented, supported
by major vendors etc. etc. etc. The most fact that they are not supported
on a LAN means that autoconfiguration on this LAN is impossible
or even _prohibited_.
Actually, even action, undertaken when configuration fails
is prescribed. Namely: machine must enter to manual configuration mode.
What's about customer's blames as an argument, you could foresee this.
IETF people eated their bread not for nought.
Put simply yourself on the place of netadmin seeing a machine
sweeping wide range of addresses or sending some apparently useless
broadcasts to switched network. This machine will be catched and killed even
if it does not create any serious problems at the moment.
F.e. imagine his nightmare: "What will occur after powerdown,
when thousand of machines restarts during one second?
If even plain "rusers" kills that switch on 4th floor... Aieee."
Does this netprobe make required random delays?
Does it use gratuitous information?
