What on earth are you talking about?
a. The semantics of these functions are well-defined, stable, and 
documented in the gcc documentation.  It's not like they have 
compiler-version-specific definitions that could change.
b. For static binaries, this is no issue.  klibc is shared, not dynamic 
(thus eliminating the need for a space-consuming dynamic linker), but it 
also means that there is no cross-version calling; each build of the 
shared klibc library has a hashed filename, thus allowing multiple 
versions of klibc to coexist if absolutely necessary.
Either way, this is a red herring.

I'm not entirely surprised.
