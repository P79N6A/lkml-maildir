Why would you want a virtual network device implementation? The whole
point of jail()
is a replacement for chroot() for housing untrusted root processes in
a lightweight
manner as reasonable.  I think in one way at least, I have restricted the manner
of jail behavior better than the current linuxjail, by turning off
capabilities rather than
blocking mknod(), mount(), etc.
I do like the idea of patching in through LSM, however not everything
can be done there.
In particular, I could escape from the jail as implemented there by a
classic chroot()
trick.
