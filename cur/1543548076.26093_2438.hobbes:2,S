What about an enhanced printk tool that virtually inserts conditional
printk's into the kernel without the need to recompile the kernel?
Logpoints, conditions and what to print could be set with a usermode
tool. And there should be an emergency stop keycombination that clears
all logpoints. That's all.
Activating logging should be as easy as feeding an email into the
usermode tool. And a second tool could automatically prepare an email
with the results.
