While this was running, X performance sucked.
There's a variety of ways of classifying this problem.  Among other
things we're classifying a compute bound process as i/o bound.  
Could someone put this into their suite of stress tests?
                         * * * * *
By the way, for comparison purposes:
$ time rm -rf t
real    2m9.219s
user    0m0.340s
sys     2m7.510s
$
("t" was the directory where I created all those files).
And,
$ time perl -le 'use File::Basename; for (1..80000){s-\B-/-g; s/$/f/; $d= dirname $_; -d $d or mkdir $d, 0777; open FILE, ">$_" or die $!}'
real    1m29.630s
user    0m10.940s
sys     0m5.100s
$ cd ..
$ time rm -rf t
real    0m2.816s
user    0m0.450s
sys     0m2.370s
$
[Plus maybe half a minute of disk activity after a short delay, as all
those sub-directory entries were cleaned up.]
