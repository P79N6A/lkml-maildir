You could simulate that by just sending packets using unix sockets 
between threads bound to different CPUs. Sending a packet allocates; receiving 
deallocates.
But it's not clear that will really simulate the cache bounce environment
of the database test. I don't think all passing of data between CPUs 
using slub objects is slow.
