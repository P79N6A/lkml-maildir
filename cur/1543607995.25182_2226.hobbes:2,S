Hi Marko.
> PS Are /dev/null and /dev/zero also redundant?
I regularly use both...
 1. Find a download that doesn't appear where one expected it...
	find / -name "wanted-but-lost-download" 2> /dev/null
 2. Create a loop-mounted partition to populate as a CD image before
    burning the CD in question.
	dd if=/dev/zero bs=1048576 count=750 of=/tmp/cd.img
	mke2fs /tmp/cd.img
	mount -o loop /tmp/cd.img /img/cd
 3. Create a loop-mounted partition to populate as a floppy image.
	dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1440 of=/tmp/floppy.img
	mke2fs /tmp/floppy.img
	mount -o loop /tmp/floppy.img /img/floppy
Neither has alternatives that make sense as far as I can see.
Best wishes from Riley.
