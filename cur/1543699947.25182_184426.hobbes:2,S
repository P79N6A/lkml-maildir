Hi all,
ISD200 based IDE harddrive bay doesn't work. This problem
was already discussed some time ago (before 2.5.67) and
patch was included in 2.5.67 to fix it. Unfortunately this
harddrive bay isn't mine and I got it for testing only
yesterday.
Kernel message log attached (compressed because it is large).
Please take a look at it.
Best regards.
