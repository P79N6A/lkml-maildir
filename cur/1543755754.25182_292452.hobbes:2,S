This is unquestionably the right thing to do (at least compared to what we 
have now).  The loop device driver has no business assuming that the 
underlying filesystem uses the generic routines.  I always assumed it was 
a simple design error that it did.  (Such errors are easy to make because 
prepare_write and commit_write are declared as address space operations, 
when they're really private to the buffer cache and generic writer).
