I agree completely. Friday night I had a talk with a few others at the office,
and we all came to a concensus that the 'nice' value really shouldn't be a
factor to determine which process gets killed first. The primary point was
that 'nice' is most commonly used for background tasks that are meant to run in
hidden and unseen with low priority. It would be extremely upsetting if a user
decided to log in and browse 50 picture-intensive pages with netscape,
racking up the memory over time, and allowing the OOM killer to zap the
peaceful, 'nice' process in the background that wasn't causing any harm.
Why else would you nice a process? Because you don't want it to interfere with
normal cpu usage by those that normally use the system. You expect that process
to still be running at the end of the day when everyone's gone home.
Regards,
 Byron
