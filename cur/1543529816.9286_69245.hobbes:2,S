df -a shows this under 2.2 (and 2.3.49):
none                         0         0         0   -  /proc
While it shows this on 2.3.51:
none                      -1      -1        0    100%   /proc
I'm using an "older" version of df:
df (GNU fileutils) 3.16
Which is probably why I get -1, and you get 4294967295. Changes doesn't
say anything about the version of fileutils you need.
It looks like they make those special once return -1 instead of 0 for some
reason.
