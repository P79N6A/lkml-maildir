In reality I have not seen such a problem yet, even on an old real
slow P1 which I tricked to do highres, but of course if we add such
time consuming debugs and make it slow enough the system will spend
all the time running the tick timer :)
We should at least warn once about such a loop. 
I'm not sure about the mandatory interval though: 
Try the same test with HZ=1000 periodic mode (HIGHRES/NOHZ=off) and I
bet you see the same problem, just not in hrtimer_interrupt().
