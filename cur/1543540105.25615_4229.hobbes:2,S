This is OK with me, *IF AND ONLY IF* we don't want to add to /etc/mtab,
or mess around with the locks mount(8) does... I refuse to code that
into autofs.  The C equivalent is quite nice; however, it is rather
unfortunate from an autofs standpoint that the "both directories or both
non-directories" requirement exists (autofs don't have
"non-directories".)
