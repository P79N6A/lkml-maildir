This is a known problem and one that I'm hoping (if no one else gets
around to it) to fix when I get back home and have access to my SMP
sparc to test with.

I know for sure that I am, check out 
http://osinvestor.com/sparc/
 for my
sparc32 kernel status page.  I also know for sure that not many other
people are.

There is a patch going around for this that will hopefully be in the
next stock release.
One note: please e-mail the sparclinux@vger.kernel.org with sparc
specific problems since you're more likely not to get lost in the noise
there.  Also, the list archives at
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-sparc (or various other places)
hold answers to all sorts of questions.
