We had similar problems with Compaq Proliant XEON EEPro100 NIC and Compaq 
Spart Array. System would periodically hang or panic. Problems went away 
after I replaced EEPRO100 NIC with TLAN NICs(Texas instruments or 
"Thunderland"). It's a good indication that there could be a problem with 
eepro driver.
