I'll add
      *        Make sure everything reaches the disk
I remember turning off `update' because after the equivalent was built
in to the kernel, but it was removed at the next kernel version.  (It
got put back soon after).
One day, at the end of the day, the system crashed for some reason.
Unfortunately, much of the data I'd written during the _entire_ day
hadn't reached the disk because nothing was flushing it to disk.
