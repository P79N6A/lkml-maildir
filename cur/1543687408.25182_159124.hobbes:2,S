Then we can add a struct class_device into fb_info, which will allow us
to export sysfs attributes for each fb_info device to userspace.  It
will provide the proper lifetime rules for such structures, and allow
the individual drivers a place within sysfs to export different things
they might want to export.  Any /proc files you currently have could
then be removed.
For an example of what needs to be done, see the recent v4l core changes
that were just introduced into the kernel tree.
Again, this is a 2.7 thing (which could easily be backported to 2.6.late
afterwards), nothing I want to attempt to do at this time.
