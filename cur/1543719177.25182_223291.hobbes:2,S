Machine Check Exceptions are in front of all hardware issues, not kernel 
issues. It is your CPU trying to tell you that something is wrong in the
hardware.
The 2.4 MCE code tends to label unrelated MCEs as "GART error" because
of bugs in the MCE decoding functions. There is a full fix for that 
in the works.
In some early 2.4 kernels it also managed to trigger a CPU bug
by writing directly nb registers.  This should be fixed in later
2.4 kernels and also in SuSE SLES8-SP3.
Best alternative is to use 2.6 which has much improved MCE handling.
