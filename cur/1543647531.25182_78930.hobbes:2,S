OK, I've read through the patch and the original thread re this problem.
There are a few obvious things to try:
  - Does the problem come up when there is only one rsync running
    concurrently?  (If so, we have a SMP race.)
  - Is the behaviour the same before and after Ted's cleanups?  (Get
    the old version out of cvs...)
  - Does the problem manifest with Ext2?  (Somebody - me probably -
    has to dust off the Ext2 patch and add the new hash.)
