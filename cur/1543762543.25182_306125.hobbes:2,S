Easy, we use the delimiter on anything ending with a number at the end of
the device name.. so for device = "foobar0", this would end up as
/sys/devices/platform/foobar0.0, whereas in the latter case this would
end up as /sys/devices/platform/foobar0.
The first case is a corner case, and really shouldn't happen that much in
practice outside of broken drivers.

No you don't, it's pretty easy to figure out that if the end of the
device name is a number that there will be a delimiter between that and
the id. This should be the exception, not the rule.
We don't go around changing /dev semantics everytime someone decides to
call their device something silly, I don't see why platform devices
should be treated differently, better to just fix the broken drivers..
