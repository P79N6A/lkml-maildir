# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:
# Project Name: Linux kernel tree
# This patch format is intended for GNU patch command version 2.5 or higher.
# This patch includes the following deltas:
#	           ChangeSet	1.1196  -> 1.1197 
#	 drivers/base/core.c	1.65    -> 1.66   
#	include/linux/device.h	1.87    -> 1.88   
#
# The following is the BitKeeper ChangeSet Log
# --------------------------------------------
# 03/05/03	jejb@raven.il.steeleye.com	1.1197
# sysfs: add default show/store for bus_type
# 
# These are used if the device_attribute show/store are empty.  They
# allow buses to do string based parsing of the device properties.
# --------------------------------------------
