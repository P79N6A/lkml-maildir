Thanks David for the hint. :) I buy it.
I found that the ss command from iproute2 package does use the 'netlink TCP
dumping' you mention (how many people on earth heard about that ?)
Instead of 15 minutes for a 'netstat -n > FILE', my server takes now 6
seconds with 'ss -n > FILE', with 200000 sockets opened.
