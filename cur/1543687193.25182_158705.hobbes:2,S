Not really, the RFC you keep quoting is broken in several
regards:
1) It is non-functional in environments containing systems
   using the host ownership model for IP addresses which the
   RFC standards fully allow.
2) It does not consider the cases where a host is not completely
   aware of all subnets present on a given link.  This is actually
   quite common.
   Dropping such ARP requests can only be done when the
   the host is aware of all subnets that exist, which is cannot
   be possibly true.
