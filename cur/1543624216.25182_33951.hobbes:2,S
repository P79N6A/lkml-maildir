Not quite if it still works... or if nobody is implementing
the standard up to word, becouse for example everybody was
deriving the drivers (or let's say it clear: his TCP/IP stack)
from the same basic source code and finally the hardware adjusted
to the reality instead of the standard.
Or if the standard was in fact just an aftertought after some
"refference implementation".
And anyway it's hard to argue that code is formally tighter then
narrative. (I didn't argue whatever it's formally correct).
That's a rather trivial fact.
But anyway I think you understand those issues and it's a bit
"theoretical" in respect to the ATA stuff right now.

So let's just settle on the fruitless discussions and wait and see... OK?
Peace? I was basically just alarmed by the fact that you sounded a bit
discouraging to Pavel. (BTW.> The flush part I have already just added to my
sorcebase for the parts which Pavels patch tangles... ;-)
