It's an ugly kludge. Badly broken one, at it. Heck, try to use ls with it.
Or make. Or pwd, for that matter. Try the situation when filesystems
actually overlap (have common names). No offense, but as far as I'm
concerned there is no way to get that into the tree. Final word belongs to
Linus, indeed, but IMNSHO it's broken beyond redemption.
