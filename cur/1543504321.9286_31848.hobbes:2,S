Hm, Compaq introduced their new intel-based flagship server (8-way Xeon, based on ProFusion architecture) running SAP R/3 on Linux at the german CeBit fair.
A week ago DeTeCSM (daughter of the german telecom) installed the worldwide
first Linux SAP R/3 4.03b ontop Oracle 8.0.5 for a customer using this
hardware. Distribution used was RedHat 6.0. According to the german c't
magazine there are benchmarks to be published...
Best regards,
Daniel
