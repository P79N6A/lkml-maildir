The problem is with the preemptible kernel patch...
You need to be using a recent patch, this bug was fixed awhile back in
an explicit patch (patch-rml-2.4.xx-preempt-ptrace-signal-fix-1).
It was merged into the 2.4.10 patch with revision 5, and it is in all
newer patches.
You can get patches for 2.4.10, 2.4.11-pre2, and 2.4.10-ac3 (soon -ac4)
