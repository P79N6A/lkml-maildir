Yes, I had realized that I was looking into the wrong place. Unfortunately
after I've sent a posting. My apologies.

I'm not sure that it will work (we scan the thing in many places and
quite a few may be blocking ;-/), unless you propose to protect individual
steps of the scan, which will give you lots of overhead. I suspect that
swap_out_mm() needs fixing, not everything else... And it looks like we
can't drop the sucker earlier in handle_mm_fault. Or can we?
As crazy as it may sound, what about keeping a small cache of pages,
taking from that cache and doing refills when we are crossing the boundary
of dangerous area (refusing to enter it until the number of pages in cache
will grow bigger than amount of processes in dangerous part)?
