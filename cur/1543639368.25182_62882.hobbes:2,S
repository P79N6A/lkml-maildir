But page replacement is a means to an end. One thing tht would be
very interesting to know is how well the basic VM assumptions about
locality work in a Linux server, desktop, and embedded environment.
You have a LRU approximation that is supposed to approximate working
sets that were originally understood and measured on < 1Meg machines
with static libraries, tiny cache,  no GUI and no mmap.
