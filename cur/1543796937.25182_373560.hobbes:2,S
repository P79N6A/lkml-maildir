I don't promise anything but we have been working on an open source 
release of OSS (OpenOSS) at least for OpenSolaris during next 
spring/summer. Linux port is also possible at the same time or bit later. 
Sorry but I can't give any more details at this moment.
For various reasons this stuff will be released outside the kernel build. 
For this reason I'm more or less worried about the difficulties 
related with compiling driver code separately from the kernel image.
Best regards,
Hannu
