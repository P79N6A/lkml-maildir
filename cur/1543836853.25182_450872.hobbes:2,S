Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: Double the per cpu area size
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

With the support for more than 256 irqs kernel_stat.irqs has
grown noticeably in size.  When asked about it no one wants to
keep less information, so we need a larger per cpu area.
According to my rough calculations the per cpu usage
has grown by about 15K (in the worst case) while the per cpu
area size has grown by 32K so we should have enough room for
a while.
