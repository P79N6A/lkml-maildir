Note that we discussed this early on, and the issues with full-file 
handling haven't changed. It does actually have real functional 
advantages:
 - you can share the objects freely between different trees, never 
   worrying about one tree corrupting another trees object by mistake.
 - you can drop old objects.
delta models very fundamentally don't support this. 
For example, a simple tree re-linker will work on any mirror site, and
work reliably, even if I end up uploading new objects with some tool that
doesn't know to break hardlinks etc. That can easily be much more than a
10x win for a git repository site (imagine something like bkbits.net, but
got git).
Whether it is a huge deal or not, I don't know. I do know that the big 
deal to me is just the simplicity of the git object models. It makes me 
trust it, even in the presense of inevitable bugs. It's a very safe model, 
and right now safe is good.
