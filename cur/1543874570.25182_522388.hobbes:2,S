Subject: [PATCH 0/4] i386 GDT cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

After lots of good feedback and contributions from the last series, this
set of 4 simply cleans up GDT usage in i386.  Percpu->pda is not
included: it's really a separate problem (but made much simpler by these
patches).
Patches are:
no-gdt-pda-alloc.patch 
        - Simplify by using per-cpu vars for gdt & pda, not allocating.
        This patch has been seen here before, and Jeremy Fitzhardinge
        acked it.
direct-percpu-gdt.patch 
        - Simplify boot by switching straight from boot_gdt_table
        straight to per-cpu versions, rather than going to cpu_gdt_table
        then per-cpu gdt.  This is a new approach after Ingo cautioned
        about removing boot_gdt_table.
cleanup-cpuinits.patch 
        - Simple patch: we can now roll two identical functions together
cleanup-gdt-accessors.patch 
        - Remove a level of indirection
Cheers,
Rusty.
