Two key points here --
* isa_xxx are only to ease the transition to newstyle ioremap.  if you
are hacking code, go ahead and update it to use
ioremap/readX/writeX/iounmap.
* You can never directly use a struct to access an offset in MMIO
space.  To do so is broken and bad bad bad.  The only acceptable way is
	my_struct = ioremap (...);
	my_reg = readb(&my_struct->foo_register);
I much prefer to avoid structs, and use macros to access registers
instead:
	my_reg = RTL_R8 (FooRegisterConstant);
