You don't need a huge '||' chain, you can always have more than one default
line:
config ATARI_KBD_CORE
	bool
	default y if KEYBOARD_ATARI
	default y if MOUSE_ATARI
Basically a line "config A \n select B" is transformed into "config B \n
default y if A".  It's the same number of lines, they're just in a new place.
Another alternative would be to shift the arch specific drivers to a file
that's arch specific.  e.g. move MOUSE_ATARI from drivers/input/mouse/Kconfig
to arch/m68k/Kconfig.
