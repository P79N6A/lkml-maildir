Subject: [2.4 patch] remove obsolete IrDA list from MAINTAINERS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/10/20/91

Mail to the list that is in MAINTAINERS bounces and the new mailinglist
doesn't accept mail from non-subscribers. Since you can find this new
mailinglist at the IrDA web page it's IMHO the best to simply remove the
mailing list entry from MAINTAINERS:

               "Is there not promise of rain?" Ling Tan asked suddenly out
                of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
               "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
