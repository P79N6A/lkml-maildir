It doesn't matter .... The device is not a swap partition - from the
original message:

The error message is quite clear (the set blocksize isn't, but that
is during the identification and isn't an error, but appears to be
a status..).
If you are going to swap on a mounted file system, then you have to
specify a swap file, formatted for swap.
The message that was output says exactly what is needed for protecting
against configuration errors.
