Well I posted that thing two weeks ago, occuring on a dual 240 
K8T-Master from MSI, and yes: running irqbalance works fine, but still I 
believe that there is some sort of weirdness in initialization code of 
the kernel (2.6), because on 2.4 Kernels smp-affinity defaults to every 
cpu and on 2.6 it doesnt.
