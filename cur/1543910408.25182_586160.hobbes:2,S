... while unsigned long long is 64bit, which is definitely not what
one wants.  For sparse it's "unsigned long is special".
FWIW, this patch puts it in linux/types.h as unsigned long.  Eventually
we might want to switch explicit casts to/from unsigned long in such contexts
to uintptr_t, but for now we can't start complaining about unsigned long -
too many places are using it.  I'll see what can be done to get sane
assistance from sparse in that kind of work...
