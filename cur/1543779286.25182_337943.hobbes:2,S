We _are_ going to fix the ACPI interpreter.
As to irq's changing during suspend - I'll believe that when I see it, not 
when some chicken little runs around worrying about it. I doubt anybody 
has ever seen it, and I'm 100% sure that we have serious breakage right 
now on machines where it definitely doesn't happen.

We'll revert to the behaviour that it has traditionally had, and start 
working forwards in a more careful manner. Where we don't break working 
setups.
