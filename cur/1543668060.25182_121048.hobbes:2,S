Subject: [2.4 patch] fix ad1889.c .text.exit error

In 2,4,21-pre6 the function ad1889_remove in drivers/sound/ad1889.c is 
__devexit but the pointer to it doesn't use __devexit_p resulting in a 
.text.exit error if !CONFIG_HOTPLUG.
The following patch is needed:
--- linux-2.4.21-pre6-full-nohotplug/drivers/sound/ad1889.c.old	2003-03-27 22:40:12.000000000 +0100

I've tested the compilation with 2.4.21-pre6.
