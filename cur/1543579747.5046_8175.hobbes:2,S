I saw version 0.9.0 of the nvidia fb driver floating around on the nvidia
for linux mailing list some time ago. I tried it and liked it, it was A LOT
faster and seemingly bug-free. I decided to wait for it to get integrated
into the kernel. Time has gone by, the linux-nvidia archives are down and
no-one seems to have submitted this patch, despite the fact that there was
some talk about who should do it on the linux-nvidia-list. Has anyone tried
to submit this? Otherwise I have it right here, not in patch format, but as
a tar file including all files in the riva directory. 
fbdev.c lists changes by Jindrich Makovicka:  accel code help, hw cursor,
mtrr support.
There was a minor bugfix patch to this one as well, I think it's applied to
my version since the version number is 0.9.0jm2, but I can't recall for
sure. 
I don't know if I could make a correct patch, since one filename
seems to have changed from nv_local.h to nv4ref.h, and the official 
kernel version has some changes made after ths version was released 
(in November I think).
I'm putting the file up here in case someone wants to make a patch out of 
it and submit it to Linus:

Please cc to me, I'm not on the list.
Robert.
