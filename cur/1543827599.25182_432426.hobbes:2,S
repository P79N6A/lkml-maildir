Looks like your hardware is failing.
Disassembly shows:
Code;  c0237744 No symbols available   <=====
   0:   ba 08 00 00 00            mov    $0x8,%edx   <=====
...and there is no way this instruction can cause that fault.
Your previous bug looked flakey too.
Run memtest86 overnight to see if it finds anything.  Also
check the CPU temperature.
