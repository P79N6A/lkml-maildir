False.
Let me verify my conjecture. take a random eject: eject-2.0.2.
# grep 'ioctl(' *.c
eject.c:  status = ioctl(fd, CDROMEJECT_SW, onOff);
eject.c:  status = ioctl(fd, CDROM_SELECT_DISC, slot);
eject.c:  status = ioctl(fd, CDROMLOADFROMSLOT, slot);
eject.c:  status = ioctl(fd, CDROMCLOSETRAY);
eject.c:  status = ioctl(fd, CDROMEJECT);
eject.c:  status = ioctl(fd, SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND, (void *)&scsi_cmd);
eject.c:  status = ioctl(fd, SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND, (void *)&scsi_cmd);
eject.c:  status = ioctl(fd, SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND, (void *)&scsi_cmd);
eject.c:  status = ioctl(fd, FDEJECT);
eject.c:  status = ioctl(fd, MTIOCTOP, &op);
You see, it indeed uses SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND to do its deed.
My own version adds an
	ioctl(fd, BLKFLSBUF)
before ejecting.
