Yes, but to see the affect of cutting down the instruction length, you
need to make benchmarks that emulate running 'forever'. Many bench-
marks access some memory over-and-over again in a loop. This does
not exercise the need to refill prefetch so the benchmarks ignore
the advantages obtained by reducing the amount of instructions needed
to be fetched from memory.
