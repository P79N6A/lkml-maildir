It is possible to receive ESHUTDOWN without being disconnected.  For 
instance, a race with suspend could cause it to happen (although if your 
driver is written correctly that race should never occur).  Another more 
likely scenario is that you have an active URB while calling 
usb_set_interface(); the endpoints for the old altsetting get disabled and 
the URB returns with an ESHUTDOWN error.
