Consider: 
open("/bin/true\naudit(1111008484.824:89346): ...", O_RDONLY);
I don't think this patch is enough -- either we need to escape the text
completely or just dump it as hex instead of a string. One option would
be to dump it in quotes as a string if all chars in the string are in
the range 0x20-0x7e, and as hex otherwise. That slightly complicates the
parsing, but not by much, and still gives you plain text in the majority
of cases while protecting against abuse.
