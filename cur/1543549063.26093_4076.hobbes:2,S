Hi,
The problem is this: in 2.4.0-test8 someone sent in a patch that removed
the #ifdef MODULE, #endif pair from around the module initialization
routines in drivers/scsi/sr.c and drivers/scsi/sd.c and changed them
from the older style init_module()/cleanup_module() syntax to the newer
style module_init(init_function)/module_exit(exit_function) syntax.
The result is now when sd.c or sr.c are compiled into the kernel, not as
modules, the module-only initialization routines are run at boot time.
This results in all my disks being detected twice, so since I have two
scsi disks sda is now sda _and_ sdc, and sdb is sdb _and_ sdd.  Another
side effect is that subsequent loading of any lowlevel scsi modules
such as ide-scsi or ppa, for example, will result in a scsi subsystem
lockup because the lists have been whacked.
Just letting you know in hope it'll get fixed soon.
Thanks for your time,
Paul Laufer
