I tried something like that, too. However I didn't fill up the file -
I used lseek instead, this way I was only able to access the first
page. If I tried to access any higher pages it bus-errored. Maybe filling
it up does the trick - however then the process will get a private copy
of all pages in this 1Meg - even the ones that are not touched by the BIOS.
This will give me a 1Meg footprint for each real mode image.

OK, I'll look into this, too.

:-)) We want to get Xfree86 4.0 released some day. If I have
to work myself into this, too it will take even longer.
Thanks a lot for the hints!
