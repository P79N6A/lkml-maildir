P.S.
/sched_mc=1/sched_mc=0
P.P.S.
I suggested setting sched_mc=2 to be default since we already have the
pain that this development inflicted, we may as well have the gain as
well, such that it's a trade-off in favor of the fork/exec load at the
expense of cache sensitive loads like mysql+oltp, but the authors prefer
to leave the default as is.

Yes, more testing is definitely due. I'd like to hear from people
with larger and newer boxes as well before I would be comfortable making
sched_mc=2 as default.

WRT these latencies, I'm of two minds.
On the one hand, those huge latencies are unacceptable, but on the
other, there are knobs in place for anyone running a load that really
does wake a zillion long sleeping threads simultaneously.  No matter
_what_ amount of sleeper fairness we try to achieve, this latency
multiplier potential is there.
I see no really appetizing option.  You can easily scale the bonus back
as load increases to limit the pain potential, but that has down side
potential too, and would likely not be a good default: for mysql+oltp,
wakeup preemption is a positive factor through the entire performance
curve, up until it is totally jammed up on itself.  On my Q6600, the
preempt/no-preempt curves converge at 64 clients/core.  On the
interactivity front, X and it's clients don't care how many hogs they're
competing against, any preempt ability we take translates directly into
interactivity loss for the user.  Not to mention events. 
The potential of wake_up_all() bothers me more than this starter pistol.
(why I leapt straight to it from debug output, I've been there before;)
