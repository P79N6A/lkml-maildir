Didn't work as expected. I get 51 non-relevant results and
your other suggestion at lkml reveals 36.000 matches.
What's the problem with just giving an exact URL? Or with
putting it up somewhere, so people can download it?
If bandwidth or traffic limit is a problem, please send me an
email containing the sources of this tool and I'll host it, since
my traffic limit would be 150Terabyte and bandwidth is >=155MBit/s.
So please help us out here.
Thanks & Regards
Ingo Oeser
