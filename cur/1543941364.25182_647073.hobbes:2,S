It's a bit moot because Xen doesn't support any kind of large page yet, 
but there has been some work in that area.  The main problem with using 
set_pte is that Xen supports trap'n'emulate for pte-level accesses, but 
not for upper levels.
Looks like you're right about the rest of cpa; may as well make it all 
consistent for now, and we can fix it later when the need arises.
