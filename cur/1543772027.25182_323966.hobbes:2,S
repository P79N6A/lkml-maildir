First it forked process (child) gets the same CPU as that of parent.
forking a child gets the same CPU and later part of fork will call 
wake_up_new_task () to fetch the run-queue of the CPU and 
__activate_task () is called to move task into run-queue. 
Later rescheduling of the process may move process to another
run-queues.

Child will always goes to the parent's run-queue (CPU) for the first time.

Yes, load balancing algorithm is used. tasks will be pulled from
very busy processors to lesser busy processors.

one run-queue per physical CPU
