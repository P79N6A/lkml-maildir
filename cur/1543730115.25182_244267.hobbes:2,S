Actually look  at what  happened when the  probing part of  the NVidia
driver was published: people looked at it and fixed bugs.
Opensourcing a driver can actually be a benefit for the company, since
they don't  need to pay  some maintainer for  it then plus  they won't
need  to put  up  with problems  after  kernel changes  and stuff  and
neither with bugs in the code.
The  problem is  that people  still  think that  there is  intelectual
property and that it can be stolen. (The famous blackbird case (Yes, I
said the B word!)) But look at UNESCO: maybe one day the world will be
different.
