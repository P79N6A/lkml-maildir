Wrong syntax:
 :%s/have/doesn't have/gc

In reality, the file has already been extended in prepare_write() and
the fs's should 
always make this assumption.  If the write fails, it should be treated
as an I/O error.  i_size should be assumed to have been extended at this
point (since the space on the device has 
already been allocated. 
The way aroud this is to enforce i_size updates in prepare_write() 
(this is where I return, "out of space" return codes, and the other FS's
would probably be ok with some minor 
changes.).
