PM Core for OMAP1 platforms.
PM Core provides arch dependent routine to get/set operating points,
hooks up with arhc independent PowerOP layer and utilizes
clock/voltage framework to access hardware. PM Core is expected
to handle additional arch specific actions required to accompany clock/voltage 
framework during operating points change (for example if 
simultaneous coupled clocks/voltage change needs special attention on a 
platform).
Basic building block for PM Core layer is platform power parameter concept. 
Current OMAP implementation relies on "smart" virtual mpu clock
introduced by OMAP1 clock framework (#define
PM_CORE_USE_MPU_CLOCK).
Since voltage framework is not merged into mainline yet
routine to change voltage is temporary implemented in the
PM Core for reference.
