I did a short check through the pre10 patch but couldn't find my small
patch to linux/net/sunrpc/sched.c I sent you back in August.
This patch fixes (at least for us) the problem where rpciod still
keeps references into the root fs even after it was daemonized.
I didn't get any reaction after posting this patch, neither
positive nor negative. 
In case you don't remember here's the patch again:

        siginitsetinv(&current->blocked, sigmask(SIGKILL));
        recalc_sigpending(current);
        spin_unlock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock); 
Is there any reason for not including this in 2.2.20?
It helps us getting rid of the initial ramdisk rootfs 
on our diskless clients...
