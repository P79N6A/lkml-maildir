So your saying I should actually trust my distro to build a kernel right? I build my own kernels, I have since day one. But, heres a semi-key point, what happens to vendor patches? Do they ever get folded back into the main tree? mdk and rh I know do alot of patching.  Its a waste of effort if the patches arnt looked at. And also, I was using that as a rant example. Ive never had a kernel break for me except for the parport and loopback problems. And then, I just built parport without ieee, and Im not using loopback rightnow anyhow, so its not a big loss.
