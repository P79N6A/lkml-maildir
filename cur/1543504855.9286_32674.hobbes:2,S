Hi Lee.

All it needs is one faulty shutdown to ruin that. I *EXPECT* all my
ext2 partitions to be checked after a faulty shutdown, and that resets
all the mount counts to 0 at the same time, so I would have to repeat
that after a faulty shutdown as well...

What's silly about it? The prime numbers below 100 are reasonably well
known, and easy enough to generate anyway, so it's not exactly hard to
do, and as it only ever needs doing once, it's not even a lot of
effort...
Best wishes from Riley.
