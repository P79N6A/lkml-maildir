I'm glad I read the whole thread, because when I saw it earlier and 
didn't respond, this was the question I had, why not replace the error 
with forcing "nosharecache" on, which is essentially what you have done.

Since clients may not know the server setup, and it may change for 
policy or error recovery reason, I think this patch is needed.
The cases I think are common are:
1 - single export, multiple client mounts
export /base - rw
mount /base/share - ro		[ client enforces r/o or not ]
mount /base/upload - rw
2 - export parts of a filesystem (/base) [ server enforces access ]
export /base/share - ro		[ hopefully really r/o on client ]
export /base/upload - rw	[ should work for write ]
3 - mount the same f/s with different permissions on client
export /base - rw
mount /base on point1 - rw	[ hopefully really r/w ]
mount /base on point2 - ro	[ hopefully r/o ]
I consider this *really* bad practice, but I have seen it in enough 
places to know others don't agree. It assumes the client will protect 
the r/o data.
4 - export f/s and part of f/s
export /base/ - ro
export /base/upload - rw
clients may mount one or both, with the upload directory as part of base 
or elsewhere. What will happen here?
