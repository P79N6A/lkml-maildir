Yes, right! That's a bug. Ahh, that's why all the drivers use the PCI
device id over and over and over in the sources ...

That'd be great. Though I prefer void*. Looks like "drive_data" is
intended for that purpose. Martin: How about renaming this to "private"
and a comment "solely for use by chip-specific drivers"?
A private member in the ata_pci_device[] struct would be also very
useful. Or is the "extra" field for that?

I wonder how they got there ...

Ok, I won't. Send it to me for comments later.
