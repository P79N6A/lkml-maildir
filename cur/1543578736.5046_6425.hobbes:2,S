Hi,
on plain 2.4.0 vanilla any mouse access kills the keyboard. Only way to
restore functionality is to kill gpm.
gpm writes 'protocol error' to syslog. I have access to this machine on
monday, so I can post details then.
Changing the IRQ is totally unrelated, machine works in 2.2.x with the
same config.
	regards,
		Igmar
