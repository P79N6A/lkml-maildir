No.
I'd say the bias is even stronger.
Note that the bias is not always in favor of CPU1:
* completely idle, X running, screen saver: power_saver, suspend:
bias on CPU1.
4,000 on CPU0
50,000 on CPU1
* waiting in a xterm window, typing some characters, xsnow running in
the background:
CPU0: 2900 interrupts
CPU1: 1200 interrupts
IIRC, the NMI itself was perfectly shared by both CPU's.
