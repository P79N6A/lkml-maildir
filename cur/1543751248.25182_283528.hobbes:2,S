As a whole it has always been a goal.  The functionality was first
prototyped with kexec predecessor mcore.   At OLS this year there
appears to have been a lot of discussion the consensus reached was
that a kexec type mechanism was the way to go.  From comments Andrew
Morton has made I know it is something he would like to see.
Hariprasad Nellitheertha <hari@in.ibm.com>, and Vivek Goyal
<vgoyal@in.ibm.com> have recently been working on getting  the crash
dump case working.
Personally the crash dump case is not a large motivator but at the
same time I find handling the general case is quite important.
Currently I am in the process of cleaning things up and simplifying
them so hopefully we have something interesting.

Let me clarify my question.
One of the problems  Hariprasad and Vivek seem to have been having is
that the keeping the crash dump kernel from using the first 1M.  You
have avoided that problem correct?

As I recall from looking at your patch and it was obviously your last
version was that you were using kmalloc or get_free_pages for some 
of your data structures that controlled the loaded of the mini kernel
instead of allocating those data structures from the reserved area.
I'm not quite there as currently I have one structure still not
allocated in the reserved area.  But everything else is.
As soon as I can manage to focus I will have a new patch set out.
