We can live with that if the machine otherwise survives during tests.
They are kicked off at the moment with CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG set but the point
is moot if the patch doesn't work for Olaf. Am still waiting to hear if
the two patches in combination work for him.

Rather it should be 2. I'll admit the physical setup of this machine is

it's a bad idea.
