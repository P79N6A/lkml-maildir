"TOMOYO Linux" is our work in the field of security enhanced Linux.
This is the fourth submission of TOMOYO Linux
( 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/2/170
 ).
Thank you very much for feedbacks on previous submission.
We followed the following comments and now submitting again.
 * Replace "struct semaphore" with "struct mutex".
 * Replace singly linked list with standard RCU list.
and we
 * Refreshed patches based on 2.6.23
 * Fixed some bugs.
We replaced list manipulation using RCU,
but we think that we are "over-protecting for append-only-list"
and "disabling preemption for very long time".
Mentioning optimizing and incorrect RCU usage are welcome.
This time, we excluded LSM expansion and related functions.
