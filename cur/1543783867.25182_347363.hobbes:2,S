I presume you are referring to code as in omap_32k_timer_interrupt
which calculates lost ticks as well as updates wall-time and 
sets up the next interrupt (BTW doesnt 'now' need to be
refreshed everytime in the loop otherwise will cause the problem
you cite - may not get interrupt for a long time?). Tony,
that may have cause slow bootups for you :)
I am not saying that all the above be done from the callee. In fact
in case of ARM, the same handler can be called from dyn_tick_interrupt.
Having some form of 'dyn_tick_interrupt' makes sense because
it encapsulates functionalities like:
	- If CPU is not sleeping currently, return (which can happen in SMP)
	- Reset the CPU from the bitmap, under the cover of a spinlock
	- Recover wall-time if we are coming out of 'all-cpus-were-asleep'
	  state.  In case of ARM, dyn_tick_timer->handler could be called
	  for this purpose.
> This seems to only recover one tick.  What if multiple ticks were lost?
cur_timer->mark_offset() recovers the rest.
