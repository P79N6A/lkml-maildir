Adrian,
You have a point - it is a boolean choice yes/no, about whether or not 
to compile support for this module, ... but it is in fact a module, and 
when M is chosen, cx88-vp3054-i2c.ko will build as a module.  When Y is 
chosen, it will be built in-kernel, just as all other tri-states..... 
The difference is that this module depends on DVB_MT352 ... if DVB_MT352 
is M, then this should be M/N ... if  VIDEO_CX88_DVB is Y, then this 
should be Y/N...
This particular menu item is NOT the same as the other submenu items of 
the VIDEO_CX88_DVB_FRONTEND_FOO
This may be why you thought this should be changed to a boolean, but it 
really should remain as a tristate....  Thank you though.
:-)
Regards,
