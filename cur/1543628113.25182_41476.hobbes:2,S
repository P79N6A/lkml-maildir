    ide-scsi not working on kernel 2.5.8
I try to burn cds on a 2.5.8 kernel (debian distrib) using kreatcd (and 
gtoaster) on a Ricoh Ide Cd Writer using the ide-scsi and a unexpected 
error occurs. Using the same config, when I boot on a 2.4.17 kernel, 
there ain't no problem.
Did you change anything ? The ide-scsi module hasn't been maintained 
since Jul 4, 1999 (kinds of 2.2.x period, no ?).
Did configuration change (i tried to turn over, no way...).
In fact, something worrying me. I use the ide-scsi as a module, and 
while no cd burner is launched, lsmod tells me it's used (only in 2.5.8 
kerns, in 2.4.17 it's unused). I wonder if it's not the [scsi_eh_0] 
kernel thread which tries to use it (what for ?). Maybe this is what 
blocks the use of ide-scsi...
I'll try to debug it my way, but it will take ages....
If you have any clues, tell me.
Thanx
F.-E.
