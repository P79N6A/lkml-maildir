They have kernel portions of the kind that Johannes is proposing to *remove* 
from devfs.
And unlike devfs, they need it:  they are network filesystems, not virtual 
device trees.  (Indeed, AFS and Arla, at least, don't even support devices.)
Also note that they differ from the current devfs setup:  devfs doesn't 
notify the devfsd when a device is being *accessed*, only when it is created 
or removed.

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
