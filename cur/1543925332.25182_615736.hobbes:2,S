I agree.  In an earlier patch, Mel was ignoring nid and using
numa_node_id() here.  This was causing your [Nish's] hugetlb pool
allocation patches to fail.  Mel fixed that ~9oct07.

I don't know if we have any current callers that do this, but absent any
documentation specifying otherwise, Mel's implementation matches what
I'd expect the behavior to be if I DID call alloc_pages with 'THISNODE.
However, we could specify that THISNODE is ignored in __alloc_pages()
and recommend the use of alloc_pages_node() passing numa_node_id() as
the nid parameter to achieve the behavior.  This would eliminate the
check for 'THISNODE in __alloc_pages().  Just mask it off before calling
down to __alloc_pages_internal().
Does this make sense?
