Apr 19 15:07:33 oxygene kernel: IPv6 over IPv4 tunneling driver
Apr 19 15:07:53 oxygene kernel: eth0: no IPv6 routers present
Apr 19 15:07:54 oxygene kernel: eth0: no IPv6 routers present
And now I can't rmmod ipv6 module because is became busy with -1 useage.
Do I have to reboot to remove ipv6 module ?
