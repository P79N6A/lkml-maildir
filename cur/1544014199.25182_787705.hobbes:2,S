Allright, something's unclear to me. What do you mean by the system goes
down then ? The kernel appears to be working at least to a certain
extent if you manage to trigger a sysrq from userspace... And from what
I see, it looks that all processes are somewhere in schedule.
So what is precisely your symptom here ?
