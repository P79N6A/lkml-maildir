1. summary: ci_set_power_state prints a lot of error messages
2. description
KDE running with knemo enabled I get a lot of kprint error message if I switch 
with CTRL-ALT-F1 to a text console, whicht make the terminal nearly unusable.
The message is: 
[17179664.636000] pci_set_power_state(): 0000:00:0a.0: state=3, current 
state=5
[17179665.744000] pci_set_power_state(): 0000:00:0a.0: state=3, current 
state=5
[17179666.608000] pci_set_power_state(): 0000:00:0a.0: state=3, current 
state=5
....
The problem seem not to be KDE-specific as reported here for Gnome:
http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2006/11/msg00906.html.
 As far as I have 
seen from some research on the Internet this problem does only occur with the 
below mentioned card an only if a network monitor program is activ.
relevant output of lspci -vvv:

This card does not support any power saving features, but the driver seems to 
claim the card is in state d5 (does such sate exist at all?)

4. kernel version
linux version 2.6.18.1-kanotix-1 (root@lisa) (gcc version 4.1.2 20060928 
(prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.1-13ubuntu5)) #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Mar 1 19:34:45 CET 
2007
The problem still exists in kernel version 2.6.20, I don't know about 2.6.21.
5. output

8.Fix / Patch
With the help of the Internet I have prepared a patch, which will check the 
capabilities of the device before doing any other stuff, even before printing 
the error message. This has solved the problem for me.
It will just change the order of some lines.
