Hi,
when a pipe/socket is broken, the process trying to read/write to it 
gets SIGPIPE. Is there a way to detect whether the next read/write will 
trigger a SIGPIPE? select() does not seem helpful here.
My specific case is "ssh server svprogram", in which the ssh process is 
locally terminated with ^C, and the svprogram continues to run on the 
server (good so), and when a socket breaks, it should cleanly shut down -
ideally before the next read/write is attempted.
thanks,
	Jan
