Ok, I really don't care much for 2.2.x kernel series except for testing
purposes,
( to give a preview of what performance can be achieved with 2.4)
since it will be obsoleted by kernel 2.4 soon.
The important thing is that this kernel lock doesn't produce bad latencies on
2.3.x kernels.
Ingo, If you can confirm this then I have no further complaints.
(Did you get flat /proc on your latency tests on 2.3.x running on SMP ?
 As far as I recall it seemed yes, right ?)

ok I will check out this.
