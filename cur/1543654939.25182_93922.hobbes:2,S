No. Some architectures do not save enough state on the stack by default, 
and need to do more to use do_signal(). Look at alpha, for example - the 
default kernel stack doesn't contain all tbe registers needed, and 
the alpha do_signal() calling convention is different.
If you want to handle do_signal(), then you need to do _all_ of this in 
architecture-specific files. You simply cannot do what you want to do in a 
generic way.
