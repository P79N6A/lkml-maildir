Just an outsider's view of someone that has been following this thread:
Could select() have 2 different behaviors depending on wether the
O_NONBLOCK flag is set or not on the socket.
1. If O_NONBLOCK is set, it can immediately return that the socket is
ready to be read (while CRC and possibly other checks are being done in
background). A subsequent call to recvfrom may return EWOULDBLOCK if in
the mean time the data was discarded by the kernel. This is current
behavior.
An application using O_NONBLOCK should be ready to deal with
consequences.
2. In the case where O_NONBLOCK is not set, select() could wait for all
the checks to be done before deciding to return or not. In this case the
meaning would be "there is data ready", NOT "there *might* be data
ready".
This way, there should not be any performance hits for (IMHO) well built
applications that use O_NONBLOCK. And the POSIX standard would not be
broken otherwise and applications that don't use O_NONBLOCK can rely on
actual data being read in recvfrom.
Just my 2 cents...
