Hi,
on my lapto (debian/unsable) I run a 2.6.9-rc2-mm2 kernel (because with
2.6.8.1 I have oopses on shutdown if an USB device is attached).
anyway, I still can't burn cds as a user, or rip a cd from an IEEE (==
scsi layer) device. I can rip from my internal CD-ROM (atapi).
Seriously, this is annyoing. Is this something I shall report to the
cdparanoia guys? Or is this still an issue with the new "rights" in the
kernel itself.
lg, clemens
