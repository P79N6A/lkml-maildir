I disagree of course. 
I worked on both trees quite intensive over the last years and I broke
x86_64 more than once when hacking on i386 and vice versa. 
Your "junk" argument is nothing else than a strawman which you beat on
every time when this discussion comes up.

Interestingly enough the folks with the big patch kits (Virtualization)
would be quite happy about that move.

It _IS_ the same platform. x86_64 is PC hardware with zillions of bugs
as well. And it is not modern at all. It is nothing else than a 64 bit
version of the legacy x86.

We went for a 1 : 1 replacement without merging anything which is not
obvious in the first place (identical files and files, which are just
including some other file). That way we were able to do a binary
compatible migration.
The clean up is the next step and there are enough folks out there
willing to help on this.

Really ? 
The script detected 15 identical files with a simple cmp.
It also unified another 10 by simply looking at the only line in there
"include <the other arch/file>"
And there is more of that, when you take the time and look closely at
the _32.[ch] _64.[ch] files which are created by the merge.
