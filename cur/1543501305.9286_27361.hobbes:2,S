Hi everybody!
2.2.10-ac5 got working for 1 day only. The machine do have rather high loads
(30-50) time to time - it's my development machine for KSI Linux
distribution. It runs also an ftp server with up to 200 users allowed and
lightly loaded apache server. The machine is 2xPPro200/512 with 256M RAM,
SCSI-only (GDT6117RP and NCR53C810). No IDE drives installed, IDE
controllers are off.
Kernel did panic at very light load when reading mail. The only diagnostic
was:
Kernel panic: brw_page: page not locked for I/O
-----------------------------------------------
Filesystem had not been synced, a coupla last mail messages got lost after
fsck.
The kernel does include devfs-0.99.3 from Richard Gooch, but I'd not blame
it, it does not cope with interrupts and page locking.
Sure, the kernel is SMP.
