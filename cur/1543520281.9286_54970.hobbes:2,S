hi all,
	I have a creative graphics blaster extreme video card based on permedia
2 chipset. I have compiled in permedia2 support in the kernel. But whenever I
boot I get a message saying pm2conf: no boards found. If I try vga=ask in the
lilo prompt and type in a number , say 311 , I get an error message saying no
valid mode found for that number.
	Can you please tell me as to what should I do to get framebuffer
working on my pm2.
thanx a lot
vinny
