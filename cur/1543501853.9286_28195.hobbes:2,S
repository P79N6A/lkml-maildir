SCO might document the mpx(2) call at 
http://doc.sco.com
 or
http://docs.sco.com
 in the OpenServer documentation. There
ought to be a section that covers the old Xenix calls.

I have these:
hex  name     ls octal  description
3000 S_IFMPC     030000 multiplexed char device (Coherent & v7)
5000 S_IFNAM     050000 XENIX special named file
7000 S_IFMPB     070000 multiplexed block device (Coherent & v7)
The S_IFNAM type has subtypes S_INSEM and S_INSHD, using st_rdev
values of 1 and 2 to tell them apart. An S_INSEM file is a Xenix
semaphore, shown as type 's' in a file list. An S_INSHD file is a
Xenix shared data (memory) file, shown as type 'm' in a file list.
I believe SysV systems show both S_IFIFO and S_IFSOCK as type 'p',
eliminating the 's' conflict.
The S_IFMPC and S_IFMPB types might just show as normal character
and block devices.
