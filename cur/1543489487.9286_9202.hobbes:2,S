Integration and testing are important too.
One want to bang on the development series before it becomes "stable."
2.2.0 is no good if it doesn't run on your hardware.
One might also want to get early access to device support in development
kernels that is not present in the stable ones, but in that case it's a
matter of tracking both the current Linux kernel and some third-party
patches or a module.

Another reason for tracking the kernel.  Better to learn that 'ipfwadm -V'
has no replacement in 2.2 early, and try to get a replacement put in before
2.2's release, than to complain about it afterwards.
