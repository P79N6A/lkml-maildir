Hi Andrew,
I have retested with ltp-full-20040603.  This version of LTP hangs on
our system but fortunately completes most of the tests before doing so.
It indicates that it still encounters the same errors, e.g.:
access03       1   FAIL : access((char *)-1,R_OK) failed with errno 2 : No such file or directory but expected 14 (EFAULT)
access03       2   FAIL : access((char *)-1,W_OK) failed with errno 2 : No such file or directory but expected 14 (EFAULT)
...
Here is the .config, system description, compiler version, and other info:
