Since there's none real life downside and the code will be more robust and
clean, I believe such cleanup is _worty_ thing to do at least in the long
term.
Especially the semantic of the error case looks particulary ugly/risky
right now, and since errors luckily are not so common I wouldn't be
surprised to find some driver that is just getting it wrong and nobody
noticed.
