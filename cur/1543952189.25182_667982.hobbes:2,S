The write back ones are also battery backed properly, and will switched
to write through (flushing out the cache) on the first sniff of a low
battery signal.
The decent ones (the kind used in serious business) also let you swap the
battery backed RAM module to another card in the event of a failure of a
card so you can complete recovery.
