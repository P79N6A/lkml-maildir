Is there some reason we can't just do this from vfs_unlink
inode = dentry->inode;
iget (inode);
d_delete (dentry);
fsnotify_inoderemove (inode);
iput (inode);
This would allow us to have immediate event notification, and avoid a
race with the inode going away, right?
I think the path below will make link handling as good as it can get, by
sending IN_DELETE_SELF every time inode->i_nlink goes down, and when
inode->i_nlink == 0, send the IN_IGNORE event. Also, it stuffs
inode->i_nlink into the cookie giving user space a clue about the status
of the inode.
