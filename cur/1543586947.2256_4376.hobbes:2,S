My point of view is making it easy for the average user.
This is the same as making it easy for maintainers of hardware drivers !
More module interdependencies == More complicated == More clueless users
Many users will be surprised if they must load another module (e.g."pci_multiio")
to get their parallel and serial ports working.
Thus _must not_ happen in the stable release.
