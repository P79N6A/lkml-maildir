Greg, bad guessing. This is not the device's fault but the linux usb
drivers are buggy.
The messages:
        bInterfaceClass cannot get string descriptor 1, error = Broken
pipe(32)
        cannot get string descriptor 2, error = Broken pipe(32)
go away after "rmmod hid" (or whatever driver is using the device).
This is a long standing bug.
Regards, Gunther
