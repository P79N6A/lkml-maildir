While the idea is sound in general the code your touching is almost entirely
gone in -mm and hopefully in 2.6.24.  Can you take a look at the Nick's changes
in -mm that introduce  begin_write and end_write methods replacing prepare_write
and commit_write and see if they improve your situation already.  If not they
should at least provide a framework to deal with it in a slightly cleaner way.
