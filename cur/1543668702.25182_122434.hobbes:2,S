', to see why
round cables are not needed.  Careful cable routing can easilly overcome
the issues you have.  When you have a large number of cables, the flat
cables can stack, but the round cables just make a big bundle.
Also, 3Ware sells 80-conductor/40-pin cables with two connectors in 18",
24" and 36" lengths.
I've built systems in cases that are similar to yours (Antec or Chen-Ming)
with similar numbers of drives, and had no problems with flat cables to
five disks, a CDROM drive and a floppy drive.
Good luck.
