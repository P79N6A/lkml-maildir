Yes, I have postet a alpha driver(link) on thursday last week. This driver is
a mutation from the tc/zs.c driver. The orignal driver are for the dec Station.
For the z8530 are 3..4 drivers on the kernel-tree. I think it is a good idee to
merge the drivers to one Modul. My problem is i have only a i386 
development, but i can't testing the other drivers.
Thank's
