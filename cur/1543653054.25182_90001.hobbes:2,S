Hello there,
  I'm sending this email about a problem with udma settings
in a TigerMP motherboard, wich supports UDMA 100.
  I've send it to my distribution mailing list, and several others, to no
avail, so, has a last resort I send it now to the Linux ML.
  I'm using pure vanilla linux-2.4.19, and I tried all possible configs
settings that I though that could affect this problem.
  Notice also, that before sending this I really probed around the
internet, and found some emails in the linux ML relating to this
problem. however, they were all pretty old(one year old), and all
problem reports related to this stopped long time ago, after some
patches from Patrick Vojtech, wich led me to think that recente kernel
versions had this problem fixed.
  Following this thread:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0109.3/1003.html
 i've
found a patch, tried to aply but failed, the patch was:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0109.3/att-1176/01-viper-vojtech.diff
  I'm not experienced enough to adapt the patch for 2.4.19 (the author
says it was made against 2.4.10).
  I've also read one e-mail related to IDE performance on the Tyan Tiger
mobo, URL:
http://lists.insecure.org/linux-kernel/2001/Dec/0544.html
  I *do* have the proper cables.
  The funny thing is that ONCE.. and only ONCE.. when I was trying to
solve this problem I WAS able to solve it.. and benchmarked the
disk...hdparm -t /dev/hda gave me 40.0MB/S, after enabling DMA.
Also I have tweaked with the bios settings with no luck.
  The problem looks like the kernel on boot detects the disks has UDMA33
all the time, although one does UDMA 100 and the other one UDMA 66. My
drive's performance are lousy, and I know they are capable of much more,
hda is a Seagate Barracuda IV 7200rpm 2mb cache (40Gbs)

http://www.seagate.com/cda/products/discsales/marketing/detail/0,1081,384,00.html
hdc is a Seagate "ST-36421A (U4 6421, Ultra ATA/66)
URL: 
http://www.seagate.com/cgi-bin/view.cgi?/at/st36421a.txt
   I though that my best luck was to ask if you guys, since i'm quite a
stubburn, i won't give up on this easilly, i've tried practically
everything, diferent kernel branches, bios settings, removed all extra
devices from the cables...etc
In case of being a kernel miss configuration problem.. I send attached
my kernel config file.
- If any important information is missing please warn me so I can
provide what's needed.
here's some info from hdparm, and following there's a cut from dmesg:
