Hello,
I have been reported some errors while booting 2.2.5-5 (from RH 6.0)
on a Siemens Scenic 300. Up and there, the kernel refuses to mount
the root partition (in 50% of the cases) :
FDC 0 is a pot-1991 82077
md driver0.9.0 MAX_MD_DEVS=256 , MAX_REAL=12
raid5 : mesuring checksumming speed
...
using fastest function : PI_mmx (849.é'ç MB/sec)
scsi : 0 hosts.
scsi detected total.
md.c : sizeof(mdp_spuer_t) = 4096
partition check :
  hda : hda1 hda2 < hda5 hda6 >
autodetecting RAID arrays
autorun ...
... autorun DONE.
VFS: Cannot open root device 00:30                                              
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 00:30
It should mount 03:05 (and not 00:30).
I have not seen the beast, but the mother board is very compact, with
almost everything integrated on it (but I could be wrong). Hardware
information :
Siemens Scenic 300
PII 450 MHz
AGPset  FW82443ZX
pciset fw823712
More than that, iozone on the local IDE hard disk only reports 3 Mo/s
writing, which lets me think that the chipset handling the IDE is
not very well recognized by the kernel, and could introduce some
data corruption. The guy who reported the problem told me that he
tried with a 2.2.10-ac4 kernel, and the box came up (he tried
3 or 4 times, but I can not consider that completely relevant
to indicate a full success).
Has someone already had experiences with that model (Siemens Scenic 300) ?
A+,
