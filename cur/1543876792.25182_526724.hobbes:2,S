If a common means of doing this were widespread, the script would be
distributed separately (probably with the uml utilities). Analagous to
the way bootloaders are separate from linux on real hardware.
That way, the distributor of a virtual machine would only distribute
that single system image. The user would boot it using the script
according to his own host environment.
