Hmm, okay.
But what I meant was that if jffs2's needs are "standard" enough in
the sense that they could conceivably be required by other users too
(and this one mentioned by you does appear to be one of those),
then why not make such hacks (if they are necessary and suitable
indeed, lets wait for Mark's response) part of zlib itself?
Thanks,
Satyam
