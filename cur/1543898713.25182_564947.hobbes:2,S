You cannot simply restart the URB without thinking.
The device after resumption may or may not be in the stage
you left it. It needs to be rechecked and some settings must be
renewed. You cannot simple throw an URB from an arbitrary
stage of the protocol at it.
Suspension of devices can only happen at some points
in the protocol.
