I tested this with kernel version 2.2.18 and arp_filter appeared to be
broken... I enabled it for /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_filter,
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/arp_filter and
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth1/arp_filter and it did not change the arp
behavior at all.  I enabled hidden and it worked, is there a know problem
with this functionality?

This is the default Linux behaviour.  It can be turned off by running the
following command as root:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_filter
This ensures that interfaces will only respond to arp requests for IP
addresses
which are configured as belonging to that particular interface.
