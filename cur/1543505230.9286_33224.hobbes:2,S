It compiles, ship it :)
Haven't had a chance to check the CD writing (there's a bug in 2.3.12
where I can't write CDs, see other messages) but other major components
seem to work, and very quickly too.  Samba, Wine, and CD writing will
get a workout in the next day or two.
BTW, using egcs shipped with RedHat 6.0 gives the following warnings
during compile:
