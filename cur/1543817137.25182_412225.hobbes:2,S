Well it is always going to transfer data from infd to outfd, isn't it?
If something comes up that does not do that, then that should be a new
syscall rather than a new flag.
flags just modify the manner of the transfer I think. Things should still
work if some flag is not supported, perhaps just not with optimal
performance. That said, unsupported flags probably should fail, shouldn't
they? The application / library could then retry with flags = 0.
