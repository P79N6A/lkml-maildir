Ok, let me disagree a bit.
At least if I read the patch correctly, theer's no way for upper layers to
say "I want 48-bit addressing" - it's just turned on automatically for
high sectors (or big transfers).
Well, you can mark the drive itself as wanting 48-bit transfers, but you 
can't do it on a per-request basis.
And I think this is 100% equivalent to the 6 vs 10 vs 16-byte SCSI command 
issue, and I really think it should b esolved the same way. Namely, you 
should be able to (on a "struct request" level) explicitly say that you 
want the big requests, and then the default prep_fn() would do roughly 
what you do now by default.
That way something like a SG_IO interface could force one mode or the 
other on a per-request basis.
Comments?
