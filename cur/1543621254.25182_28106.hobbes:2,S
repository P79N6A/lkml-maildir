Hi,
after starting GNOME with 2.5.5-pre1 with reiserfs on the root partition I get several funny-named files in ~/.gnome/accels and I can't start some programms anymore... When I reboot into 2.4.17 again everything works right and this files are gone again
This only happens with any kernel since 2.5.4-pre* or so and it happens everytime I try to start GNOME under such kernel.
I haven't find this files in another place and situation but I don't think it's a GNOME bug, because it works fine with older kernels
If you need some more information or something ask me
