I read SOMEWHERE in the last few days that there is a flaw in all
2.2.x and 2.3.x kernel code tcp stack including 2.2.12 allowing something
like session hijacking or a similar attack yet have seen no discussion or
patches for it here. Have I been misinformed or is it just quietly being
worked on? Thanks
