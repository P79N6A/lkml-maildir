Hmm, it's more that the profiler failed to meet a hard RT deadline
(yes, Linux has some of those) i.e. finishing its work before the next
timer interrupt occurs. I suppose a speedup is the nature of the fix...

apart from compiletests in favor of chasing longer-term issues e.g.
HyperSPARC DMA, SMP, etc., largely using mainline point releases.
