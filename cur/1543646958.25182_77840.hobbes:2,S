This raises the interesting possibility of being able to refer to
things like removable media directly, instead of the device the media
is inserted in.
The Amiga was doing this years ago.  You could access floppy drives
as, E.G. df0:, df1:, etc, but if you formatted a volume and called it
foobar, you could access foobar: no matter which floppy drive you put
it in to.
Also, Plan 9 does similar interesting things - you can do the equivilent of:
ls /internet/websites/kernel.org/
and treat the website as a filesystem.
