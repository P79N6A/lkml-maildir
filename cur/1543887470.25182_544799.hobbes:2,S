Subject: Signal state of threads can be set incorrectly

I've run into a scenario recently where the signal processing state of a
process can get out of whack--threads have a signal pending and
unblocked,
but the threads do not run.
I was pulled in to debug an issue where sometimes signals stopped being
processed in some threads within a process. It turns out the application
involved was using system() to invoke a command. While it is true that
system() is not multithread-safe and hence the application was not
properly
coded, it is disturbing that this particular application causes the
state of
threads within a process to be wrong.
Here's the scenario:
1) A process installs a signal handler for SIGINT.
2) The process sets SIGQUIT handling to SIG_IGN.
3) The process blocks a realtime signal it plans on using to implement a
timer.
4) The process creates several threads.
5) One of the threads is designed to process the timer events and calls
sigwaitinfo() to wait for the timer signal.
6) Another thread calls system() to run a command.
7) The timer expires and delivers the timer signal.
8) The thread blocked on sigwaitinfo() never wakes up even though the
kernel
shows that the signal is unblocked (due to the sigwaitinfo() call) and
queued.
After determining what triggered the failure, I wrote a test application
that duplicated the basic sequence of events. To increase the likelihood
of
the problem occurring, I increased the number of threads calling
sigwaitinfo() to ten. The test code is at the bottom of this message.
I've
reproduced the failure with reasonable consistency on both a 2.6.10 PPC
kernel and a 2.6.20 PPC kernel; I haven't yet reproduced it on the 2.6.9
i386 kernel I have available. Note that the failure mode is highly
timing
dependent and doesn't always occur.
When the test program works successfully, the output should look
something
like this:
Setting signal 2 to signal handler
Setting signal 3 to ignore
Blocking signal 41
signalThread 1 waiting for signal 41
signalThread 2 waiting for signal 41
signalThread 3 waiting for signal 41

Here all of the threads blocked on sigwaitinfo() successfully completed
the

as

The ps output shows the realtime signal is pending against the process
and
is unblocked and not ignored in the threads blocked on sigwaitinfo(),
but
yet those threads are not processing the signal. After instrumenting the
kernel I noticed that the task state for the problem threads had
TIF_SIGPENDING set, indicating they were ready to process the pending
signal.
The problem is triggered by use of the system() function. When the child
process spawned by system() exits, it delivers a SIGCHLD signal to the
parent process and also wakes up the parent process. At this point, the
thread that called system() has SIGCHLD blocked (due to internal
implementation of system()). However, other threads in the process do
not
have it blocked.
Now we have a race condition as to which runs first: a thread handling
SIGCHLD, or the thread blocked on waitpid() inside of system(). In the
former case, everything works fine; SIGCHLD is discarded by the thread
that
handles it because the process signal handler is SIG_IGN, then the
system()
thread unblocks and completes execution of system().
The failure occurs when the system() thread wins the race. In this case,
the SIGCHLD signal is pending and system() restores the previous signal
handlers for SIGINT and SIGQUIT. When restoring SIGQUIT to SIG_IGN, the
kernel executes the following do_sigaction() code in kernel/signal.c:
		if (act->sa.sa_handler == SIG_IGN ||
		   (act->sa.sa_handler == SIG_DFL &&
sig_kernel_ignore(sig))) {
			struct task_struct *t = current;
			sigemptyset(&mask);
			sigaddset(&mask, sig);
			rm_from_queue_full(&mask,
&t->signal->shared_pending);
			do {
				rm_from_queue_full(&mask, &t->pending);
				recalc_sigpending_tsk(t);
				t = next_thread(t);
			} while (t != current);
		}
Here the kernel goes through each thread in the process and clears any
pending instance of the signal if the handler is being set to SIG_IGN,
and
recalculates whether the threads are ready to process a pending signal
(recalc_sigpending_tsk()). In this specific scenario, SIGCHLD is pending
and
unblocked in most of the threads, so the TIF_SIGPENDING flag gets set
for
these threads. The system() code then unblocks SIGCHLD and completes,
and
one of the threads in the process handles the pending SIGCHLD signal.
Unfortunately, the remaining threads with TIF_SIGPENDING set are never
awakened nor do they have their state adjusted to reflect that the
signal
they were ready to process has gone away.
When the test code then queues a realtime signal to the threads blocked
on
sigwaitinfo(), those with TIF_SIGPENDING set are not unblocked even
though
they should be ready to complete the sigwaitinfo() call. This happens
because __group_complete_signal() determines through the wants_signal()
macro that the threads do not want the signal (because TIF_SIGPENDING is
already set). The end result is that the threads waiting in
sigwaitinfo()
with TIF_SIGPENDING set never awaken. Repeated delivery of the realtime
signal eventually causes the signal queue to be exhausted (which is what
caused us to notice the initial problem).
Note that suspending the process or attaching to it with gdb while it is
in
this state kicks things back into shape, presumably because the thread
signal state is properly recalculated as a result.
While the failure is triggered by improper use of system in a
multithreaded
application, is it reasonable that such an application error should
cause
the kernel to get confused on the signal state of threads? I'm also
concerned
that a similar failure could occur in a properly coded program using
sigaction().
