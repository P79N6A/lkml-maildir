yes, and here is how they show up in the config:
               ( ) No Forced Preemption (Server)
               ( ) Voluntary Kernel Preemption (Desktop)
               ( ) Preemptible Kernel (Low-Latency Desktop)
               (X) Complete Preemption (Real-Time)
measurements are needed to find out how latencies and runtime overhead
vary between these levels.
