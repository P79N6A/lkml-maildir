Hi,
Seems that some people think that I'm the person to send agpgart patches
to as I touched it last, when will I ever learn...
Here's a named initializer patch from Rusty for the agpgart code.
Pull from:  
http://linuxusb.bkbits.net/agpgart-2.5
thanks,

  [PATCH] AGP designated initializer update.
  
  The old form of designated initializers are obsolete: we need to
  replace them with the ISO C forms before 2.6.  Gcc has always supported
  both forms anyway.
