I think it would be even better to integrate this into fs/quota.c
and get rid of the extra copy entirely. The only thing you need
to do differently in case of 32 bit Q_GETQUOTA is the size
of the copy_{from,to}_user.
On a related topic, I just noticed 
typedef struct fs_qfilestat {
	__u64		qfs_ino;	/* inode number */
	__u64		qfs_nblks;	/* number of BBs 512-byte-blks */
	__u32		qfs_nextents;	/* number of extents */
} fs_qfilestat_t;
typedef struct fs_quota_stat {
	__s8		qs_version;	/* version number for future changes */
	__u16		qs_flags;	/* XFS_QUOTA_{U,P,G}DQ_{ACCT,ENFD} */
	__s8		qs_pad;		/* unused */
	fs_qfilestat_t	qs_uquota;	/* user quota storage information */
	fs_qfilestat_t	qs_gquota;	/* group quota storage information */
	__u32		qs_incoredqs;	/* number of dquots incore */
	__s32		qs_btimelimit;  /* limit for blks timer */	
	__s32		qs_itimelimit;  /* limit for inodes timer */	
	__s32		qs_rtbtimelimit;/* limit for rt blks timer */	
	__u16		qs_bwarnlimit;	/* limit for num warnings */
	__u16		qs_iwarnlimit;	/* limit for num warnings */
} fs_quota_stat_t;
This one seems to have a more severe problem in x86_64 compat
mode. I haven't tried it, but isn't everything down from
gs_gquota aligned differently on i386?
