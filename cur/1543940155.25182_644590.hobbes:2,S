I apologize if this is the wrong forum.  Please CC me on replies.
A admin accidentally deleted the swap line from the fstab file.  We
mount the swap filesystem via labels.  However, there seems to be no
way to list the label on an existing swap partition, via the command
line swap tools (mkswap, swapon/off, etc)
Is this blindness on my part, or should there be an analog to e2label
for swap partitions?
