lets assume that the APM/BIOS/idle stuff is broken
(which, as a matter of fact, is possible and very likely)
and this is the cause for the missing interrupts your
hardware sends, but the kernel never receives, wouldn't
this cause the same issues (missing interrupts) for, lets
say the harddisk or the ethernet?
anyway, glad you could '(re)solve?' your issues,
best,
Herbert
