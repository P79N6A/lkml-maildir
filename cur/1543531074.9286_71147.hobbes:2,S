Just don't use the system stack. If you design and test your app
thoroughly enough, you can be certain it never uses more than, say,
3874Kb of RAM for it and the kernel. So, you fit 4Mb, and know that
you're safe.
You can do quite a good job, I suspect, if you avoid using functions
like malloc() etc. Just use your own, static memory allocation, then
you know exactly how much RAM your process uses.
In fact, a dynamically expanding stack with a set limit (the amount of
RAM) is no worse than a fixed stack of that size...
