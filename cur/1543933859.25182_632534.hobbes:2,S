I doubt it.  skb_morph is only used on IP fragments so I don't see how
you could attribute an error from a Unix domain socket to this patch.
In any case, Unix socket packets should not have a dst at all so the
very fact that you're in that path means that you have some sort of
memory corruption.
Is this the very first OOPS/warning that you see? If not you should
ignore all but the very first one as that may have left your system
in an inconsistent state which may render all subsequent OOPSes and
warnings useless.
Cheers,
