The latest version being tested is at:
  
ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM2/device-mapper/device-mapper-0.90.02.tgz
The tgz file contains a CVS snapshot which includes patches against 2.4.16
and some documentation (and details for the CVS repository).
Currently there's a choice between an ioctl interface and a filesystem 
interface (dmfs).
Example
=======
To create a "logical volume" that concatenates /dev/sdc1 with /dev/sdd2:
[units used below are 512-byte sectors]
# cat > /tmp/lv1_table
0 1028160 linear /dev/sdc1 0
1028160 3903762 linear /dev/sdd2 0
^D
# dmsetup lv1 /tmp/lv1_table
With the filesystem interface and devfs, you could also create 
/devfs/device-mapper/lv1 by hand as follows:
# mkdir /tmp/dmfs; mount -t dmfs dmfs /tmp/dmfs
# mkdir /tmp/dmfs/lv1
# cp /tmp/lv1_table /tmp/dmfs/lv1/table
Striping is also already supported (see documentation).
