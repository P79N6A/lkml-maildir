For one, I am of the camp that believes devfs is unfixable. 
For two, where driverfs is mounted is irrelevant: /driverfs, /sys, 
/proc/bus are all valid places. 
Besides, who cares what's in /? You have /home, which is all that really 
matters, no?

So don't give them root access. Or, explain to them that they're magic, 
like the pagefile.sys file. :)
