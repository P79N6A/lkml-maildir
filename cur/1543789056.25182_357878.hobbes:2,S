I upgraded ten of our servers to 2.6.13.3 on tuesday and noticed today
that the following assertations were in one server's dmesg:
KERNEL: assertion (!sk->sk_forward_alloc) failed at net/core/stream.c (279)
KERNEL: assertion (!sk->sk_forward_alloc) failed at net/ipv4/af_inet.c (151)
This server has e1000 NIC just like most of the servers I upgraded. The
difference in our situation is that the server which logged the
assertions is still running fine. Previous kernel version on the servers
was 2.6.12.2 and it was used over 90 days without any problems.
