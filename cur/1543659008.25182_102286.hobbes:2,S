Subject: [2.5 patch] go to drivers/ide/pci/ even for !CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI

Hi Alan,
I observed the following problem with the cmd640 driver in 2.5.56:
- cmd640.c is in the drivers/ide/pci/ subdirectory.
- BLK_DEV_CMD640 does not depend on BLK_DEV_IDEPCI
- drivers/ide/Makefile only goes to pci/ if BLK_DEV_IDEPCI is selected
If the .config contains the following legal configuration:
<--  snip  -->
...
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640=y
...
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI is not set
...
<--  snip  -->
the cmd640 driver isn't built.
The following patch fixes this (similar to 2.4 where pci/ is already 
visited for !CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI):
