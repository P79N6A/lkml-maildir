No.  If you want a process to wake every HZ tick, do a little work and
then sleep again, yield() won't do that.
If HZ >= 1000, you simply can't use Linux poll() to do that; you have
to use select().  (Or epoll_wait()).
Even if select() is changed to do double-rounding-up like poll(), it
will still do this because select() times have microsecond
granularity.
