While there are good arguments for a pure SMP hardware world, there are 
good arguments in the virtualization world for virtual uniprocessors.  
No one can be sure which combination of HT / polycore / package

will be around for longer than anyone wants to think about.  As this CR4 
valid on 486s patch proves :)
