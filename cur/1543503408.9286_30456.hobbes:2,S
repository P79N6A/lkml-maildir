Why do we need PPIDOK?  What's the issue that I'm overlooking which makes
it matter if a child can create siblings without the parent's okay?  (lets
ignore moral issues here and concentrate on security ones :-)
If there is a security issue here which I've overlooked, do we need a
mechanism for clearing the PPIDOK flag?  Perhaps on exec()?
