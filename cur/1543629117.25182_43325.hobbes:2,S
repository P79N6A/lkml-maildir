Tangent a little bit to partitions.
Consider a filesystem which creates device nodes for N partitions on a 
spindle, "msdos_partition_fs".  In a discussion a while back on 
permissions, you suggested that inheriting permissions from the base 
block device was the wrong way to go, and that (for now)  'uid' and 
'gid' mount options were the best route.
Is inheriting permissions coming back into style?  Or am I reading too 
much into the permissions scheme you describe above?
