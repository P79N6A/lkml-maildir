The SCSI mid-level takes a pessimistic view and assumes one of your
SCSI controllers is ISA. According to Rubini there is another issue.
That
GFP_DMA flag also guarantees that when you get more than PAGE_SIZE bytes
(32Kbytes for instance) then seen from the DMA chip's memory space it is
contiguous. So when you drop that flag, I believe you need to "walk"
the returned buffer and check it.
Perhaps people could comment on whether the following code is
appropriate
for that:
static int chk_cont(char * bvp, int sz)
{
    int k;
    unsigned long bus_addr = virt_to_bus(bvp);
    for (k = PAGE_SIZE; k < sz; k += PAGE_SIZE) {
        bus_addr += PAGE_SIZE;
        bvp += PAGE_SIZE;
        if (bus_addr != virt_to_bus(bvp))
            break;
    }
    return (k >= sz) ? sz : k;
    /* return (sz < PAGE_SIZE) ? sz : PAGE_SIZE; <<< testing */
}
Will non-contiguous allocation every occur on the i386 architecture?
