I've thought about it, but right now Documentation is text.  Converting all 
the existing text files to html is a fairly intrusive change, and having 
multiple file formats in there seems even more untidy.  (What next, pdf?).
I'm aware there are some docbook files in there, plus an ancient graphic file, 
plus the bloody stains of various chicken sacrificies, but the point would be 
how best to clean it up...
