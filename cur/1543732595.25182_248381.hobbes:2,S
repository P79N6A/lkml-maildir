I have used find(1) for quite some time now, and have never (or very
rarely) missed this.

Totally ridiculous, especially if you factor in .gz, .bz2, .zip, .a,
.whatever.new.format.they.come.up.with.tomorrow. But then again, this would
presumably reside in a (shared) library, so it isn't so bad...

Right. tar, gzip, bunzip, et al are already around.

Dead wrong. It is better to fix it in userspace (via a library, if
required; could call random unpacking etc programs at will, even be
configured on a user-by-user basis through ~/.wacky-file-handling or
environment) than force this junk into the kernel. Kernel code is _always_
resident, extremely security critical, and hard to get right. Besides, not
everybody will want to carry this around, and so it will forever stay a
"weird Linux kernel configuration only" feature, i.e., useless in practice.

I don't see how it is "nontrivial": "tar tf some.tar" is quite enough to
find out what is inside, in a customary format.
Placing random junk in the kernel doesn't magically make it fast, right, or
useful. Quite a lot of work is required for that, much more than for
getting the same in userland.
