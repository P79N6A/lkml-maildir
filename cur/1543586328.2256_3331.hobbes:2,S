 I think I have a work around. Boot up 2.4.3 with the framebuffer
enabled as normal. Log in as root and use the fbset program to change
the settings for all the framebuffers.
eg.
fbset -a 1024x768-70
or whatever works for you. fbset has its own man page.
This makes everything hunky-dory for me, in that after running fbset
I
can go in and out of X without ever losing the video signal.
 Petr, I had a look at the drivers/video/matrox subdir and there's no
difference between 2.4.2 and 2.4.3, however there are differences in
the drivers/video dir to do with framebuffers. The files that have
been changed in drivers/video/ are:
  creatorfb.c
  fbmem.c
  fonts.c
  modedb.c
  sbus.c
 I know nothing about the nature of the changes that have been made
though!
 It does seem to be a kernel problem rather than a X4.0.3 problem
seeing as how 4.0.3 works fine under 2.4.2, and that using fbset on
the framebuffer console in 2.4.3 solves the problem.
