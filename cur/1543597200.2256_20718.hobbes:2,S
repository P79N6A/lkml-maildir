 Thanks for this fullyfledged bugreport. I've been seeing this for quite
 some time on my personal firewall machine which masquerades a pppoe
 connection for a home network however I've not been able to produce
 an oops and therefore I've had no clue what exactly the problem might
 be. I've seen this problem with every 2.4.x kernel so far with
 completely different machines and different NICs doing the same job,
 my favourite way to reproduce this is having my friend use gnutella
 though which is a really trivial method to produce this lockup.
Servus,
