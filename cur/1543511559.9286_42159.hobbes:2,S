Hi!
My previous patches with a Cyrix fix and the Athlon
support went into the 2.3.18ac series and 2.3.19.
But here is another patch:
ftp://ftp.externet.hu/pub/people/zboszor/mtrr.c-2.3.18ac.diff
As my previous one prevented a DoS (someone with
root access could lock up the CPU by clearing and
setting ARR3 if SMM was enabled) this patch goes
one step further: everyone with a Cyrix CPU in
my neighbourhood uncommented one line in mtrr.c
which clears ARR3 and gained a free ARR. So I thought
it would be useful to provide a config option that
does exactly that. With SMM disabled, ARR3 can be
used for anything just as the others and ARRs
on Cyrix are scarce because they are at most 32MB
and one can can use only 4 - or 5 with this option set.
The patch reorders cyrix_arr_init() a little
to be more logical (btw the order of those things
do not really matter) and disables ARR3 only after
SMM is really disabled.
Richard: Will you please finally increase the MTRR
driver version? :-)
Best regards,
Zoltan Boszormenyi <zboszor@mol.hu>
