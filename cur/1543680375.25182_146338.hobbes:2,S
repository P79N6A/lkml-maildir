Subject: [PATCH] Readd BUG for SMP TLB IPI
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/9/66

Readd the BUG for an spurious SMP TLB IPI.
Rationale: 
The condition is fatal and it's better to have a BUG than a hang.
The goto out code forgets to ack the IPI in the APIC. When the IPI would really arrive
at the wrong CPU it would immediately deadlock because the non-Acked IPI is retriggered.
Adding an ACK for this path is also no good, because then the SMP flusher would
need to detect this case and "retransmit" the IPI, otherwise it would hang too
in the loop waiting for other CPUs. But nobody has ever seen such a hang, so it's safe
to assume that all hardware guarantees it cannot happen.
