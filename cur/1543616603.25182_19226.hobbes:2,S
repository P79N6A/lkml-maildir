You have me confused about whether your trying to build some kind of
ethernet bridge or some kind of secret packet sniffer or some other
such thing.   It looks like you're mixing up TCP/IP and Ethernet.
Ethernet is the link level protocol that addresses NICs by the MAC
address.    There can only be one NIC on the network with the same
MAC address.   TCP/IP uses IP addresses, not MAC addresses.  And you
cannot have two IP addresses on the same link if they have the same
network and broadcast address unless you do multipathing.  
I guess that I don't understand what you are trying to achieve.
