thanks Dmitry.
Btw., this is quite similar to the yield_granularity patch i did 
originally, just less flexible. It turned out that apps want either zero 
granularity or "infinite" granularity, they dont actually want something 
inbetween. That's the two extremes that the current sysctl expresses in 
essence.
