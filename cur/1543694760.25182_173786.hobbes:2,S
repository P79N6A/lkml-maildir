The "fast mode" walks a 4 megabyte array (okay, 900k*4=3.6 megabytes) in a way 
that makes the cpu cache break down and cry, and actually brings dram bank 
switching latency into the picture.  (It's about the worst case scenario for 
memory access; fetching whole cache lines for randomly ordered 4 byte 
reads...)  Anything that doesn't do that seems like it's at least worth a 
look, but it's not a high priority just now...;)
Any future uber-xeon that has a 4 megabyte L2 cache is going to do bunzip 
_really_ fast. :)

It turns out Manuel Novoa is busy beating the source code to death with a 
profiler, which is why I'm waiting on the bzip-kernel patch.  He's sped it up 
another 10% or so since last time (extracting the kernel tarball took 22 
seconds in the original, and he's got it down under 18 now), but hasn't 
checked the result into busybox's CVS yet.  (He's still tweaking.)
No rush.  The kernel patch is on hold pending delivery of Manuel's updated 
bunzip code.  The ball's in his court at the moment.

That's what I'm working on now.  Yesterday, I glued all the bits necessary to 
bzip compress stdin to stdout into one 95k kilobyte c file (which compiled to 
a ~50k executable).  So far this evening I've trimmed that down to 79k of 
source and 48k of executable, and I'm still at the "crapectomy" stage.  Not 
actually doing serious reorganization type cleanup yet, just taking a scalpel 
(okay, vi) and removing bits that shouldn't BE there.  (The line "typedef 
BZFILE void;" should not occur in any program anywhere ever.  It just 
shouldn't.  "#define BZ_API(func) func" and "#define BZ_EXTERN extern" aren't 
really a good sign either, although they were the result of making the code 
compile on windows.  Unwinding this kind of thing is very time consuming.)
Not really relevant to the kernel, though.  Ask on the busybox list if you 
want to know more. :)

Which patches are you referring to?
I'm going to take the shepard patch and make a 2.6 version with the new bunzip 
code as soon as Manuel gets tired of making it faster.  But he hasn't yet, 
and I've got plenty of other things to do in the meantime...
