I was thinking of this; someone mentioned a 'Perl Webserver'.  I figured,
the kernel already parses the first line to get the interpreter; why
couldn't it parse the next three #! lines as well, and read in hex encoded
capabilities? (this only if the capability flag is set)  The only sensible
thing to do, then, would be to run the interpreter with that set and
ignore the interpreter's set.  (possibly an intelligent combination of the
two, but I doubt this is a good idea)

Yes, with setuid you only needed one extra flavor.  With capabilities,
it's much worse.

Well, the idea here is that the interpreter needs the proper capabilities
to do everthing asked by the script; such as bind to port 80.
