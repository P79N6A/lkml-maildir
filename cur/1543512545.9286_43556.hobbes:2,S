Hello,
A while ago I wrote some patches for the 2.2.10 kernel, which allow the
locking of processes onto processors.  Somebody (Jamie Lokier) mentioned
that there had been some interest in this area.  I've not adjusted the
patches for 2.3.x yet, or the latest 2.2.x, but that should be fairly
straight-forward.  In breif, the patches provide 3 extra syscalls:
int smp_num_cpus(void)		Returns # processors
int smp_processor(void)		Returns current processor this
				process is running on
int smp_lockto(int procid)	Attaches current process to the
				specified processor #
Rather than posting the diffs here, they're available from the following
URL: 
http://teddy.xylene.com/smp-2.2.10.tar.gz
There's also a similar one for 2.0.37 (smp-2.0.37.tar.gz).
If there's any significant interest in this, I'll move it along to
2.3.19 (latest ?).
Fred.
