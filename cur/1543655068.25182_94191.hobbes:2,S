Nice to know. :-)
Current approach with initcalls doesn't work - basically, only architecture
specific code knows what bus types are primary and therefore should be
initialized first. IOW, it would be good to have something like you've
suggested for PCI for any bus type:
XXX_bus_init(struct device *parent, int busnum)

Actually it isn't. It just happens to be that sysdata == pci_controller
on pci-based machines. However, these structures have very little to
do with PCI - it's all about IOMMUs, various address ranges and other
host-specific data.

Of course.

That's why I suggested `io_controller' name, but I can live with just
`sysdata' as well. :-)

Right, but walking up the entire tree every time is rather painful.
Things like pci^H^H^Hdma_map_{single,sg} are supposed to be fast, so I'd
like to gather IOMMU and other info directly from struct device * passed
as argument to these functions.
