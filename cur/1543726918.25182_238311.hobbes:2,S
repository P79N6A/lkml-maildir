Subject: [PATCH] Can't cross compile IA32 kernels using separate build directory

Hi Sam,
   Trying to cross compile a kernel for IA32, on a system without an asm/boot.h
fails (e.g., IA64)
Here's a patch to add in -Iinclude2 when building tools/build.o so that 
asm/boot.h is picked up from the right place.
