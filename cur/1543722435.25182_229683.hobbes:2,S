Hello,
I do have some additional questions to help others to better diagnose your
problem. Currently I am suspecting a bottle neck in your mainboard :)
In article <1088012966.1347.28.camel@solaris.skunkware.org> you wrote:

Is that peak or saturated load? you may want to try to only fill the write
back cache of the controller, to not get affected by slow raidness or disks.
The raid5 is not very good in speeding up random reads or sequential writes.
Perhaps you want to try stripping on level 0.

What is the IO Bus you are talking about? Single PCI Bus?
Have you tried an alternative operating system?

You may want to try it without a filesystem and perhaps even with a faster
raid configuration like stripping.

how does your vmstat and iostat look like? How many ram and cpu you are
talking about? is it an smp kernel?
Greetings
