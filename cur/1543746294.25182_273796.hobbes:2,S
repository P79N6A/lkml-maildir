And there I see a problem! The open() call (kernel: sys_open) allows to open
both files and directories in the standard operation.
There is the O_DIRECTORY user-space flag, but which only says "it must be a
directory". So there's something missing to say "must be a file".
Hell will freeze over if a reiser4 "object" can be ANY type, blockdev,
chardev, symlink, <think something up>.
