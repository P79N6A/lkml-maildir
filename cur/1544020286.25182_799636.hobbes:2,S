This may be just noise, but recently I have begun seeing Zombie 
processes hanging on some nodes in the computescluster:
2006      2055  0.0  0.0   9144  1260 ?        Ss   07:24   0:00      \_ 
-bash /z/gridengine/default/spool/node30/job_scripts/692747
2006      2060 39.0 38.7 1696468 1573884 ?     S    07:24 160:21 
   \_ /usr/bin/perl /z/home/trunk//bin/workqueue/worker
2006      2225  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        Z    07:29   0:00 
       \_ [sh] <defunct>
ps faux output.
Killing the parent process makes it go awasy, but this one has been 
sitting there for almost 7 hours by now, without going away, essentially 
hagning this process.
Any suggestions?
