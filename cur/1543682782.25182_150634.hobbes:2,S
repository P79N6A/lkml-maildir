At which point you're measuring the cache speed not the memory speed.

Which probably explains this result.  Do a quick sanity check - this number
seems to indicate 20 bytes per memory clock, EVERY clock - either there's
some VERY creative use of prefetching to make sure that you never hit a
cache line miss, or you're measuring the cache.. ;)
