To be honest, I didn't want to do this, but you would not accept my
argument - and you wanted to add _more_ properties into the device
handle.

Yes, but as you'll notice with my patch, lots of the users that use the
led class do not use the handle:colour name, and so stripping off
second : parameter for the color attribute was just wrong. And ugly.

But when I was investigating adding led class support to thinkpad_acpi I
couldn't use the existing LED class, as some of the LED's did not have a
pre-defined colour, but did have a description. Again, adding support
into HAL was made more difficult until you proposed screenscaping the
led colour from the device name. This isn't very nice.

Sure, I really wanted to convert the class to struct device (which I'm
more familiar with) but just tried to do minimal changes. What changes
need to be made to avoid a race? Thanks.
