I have it working in X.org with no problem.  I just can't get the drm
module working in the kernel.  Last time I tried to just add my PCI ids 
the problem was a lack of PCIE support in the drm drivers. 
FYI the fglrx drivers suck badly.  ATI hasn't bothered to keep their 
drivers up to date at all and the result is that they finally have  
working 2.6.14 drivers but only for 32 bit machines.  x86_64 is still 
broken on any recent kernel and it's been that way for months.  ATI's tech 
support basically gave up after several days and just informed me it 
wasn't really supported and there is nothing they could do for me.
