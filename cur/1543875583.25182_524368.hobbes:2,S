There are a limited set of protection registers (At least 8 insn and 8 data)
that can permit tiles of protection that are a power-of-2 megabytes in size.
However, these also have to be used to grant the kernel access to h/w
(including RAM).
Note that it's not possible to shift windows around in response to faults
because fault reporting is asynchronous - the entire remaining instruction
queue will be executed *before* the exception is actually raised to the
kernel.

That sounds reasonable.  However, I suspect that most NOMMU CPUs won't be able
to do that.  In effect you're creating a third option, I think (MMU, NOMMU,
MPU).

Same for FRV.  It is memory management - it just doesn't include virtual
memory mapping.
