Btw, these cherry-pick messages are useless (and just noise) when sending 
to me, since nobody will likely ever see the private tree that you 
cherry-picked from, so the SHA1 won't ever match anything meaningful for 
anybody but you.
So please either edit it out by hand ("git cherry-pick -e") or just ask 
git to not generate it at all (the "-r" flag, for "replay"). I thought git 
had already been fixed to not do this by default, but maybe I was 
dreaming.
