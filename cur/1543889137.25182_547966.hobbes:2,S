I tracked down a bunch of these a little while back.  It's not really
iret_exc, but since there is no _sfixup/_efixup markers iret_exc is the
closest symbol to pick on.  All the [iret_exc, _etext] warnings I found
were completely harmless from things that used, for example, mfn_to_pfn
in an __init function (which sucks in a fixup via __get_user).
