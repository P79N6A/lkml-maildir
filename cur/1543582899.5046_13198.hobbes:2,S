Alan,
You've mentioned this before.  I emailed Steve directly since I had the
same sort of problem with a trio of ethernet cards.  Hardware detection
goes wacky when mixing isapnp userspace tools with the CONFIG_ISAPNP
support in the kernel.  Steve told me: "I'm running debian sid, with
isapnptools package version: 1.21-2"
This should go into the FAQ at

Here is Alan's quote: Fri, 16 Feb 2001 12:34:03 +0000 (GMT) 
"Dont mix isapnp tools with a 2.4 kernel unless you disable ISA PnP
support in the kernel. It needs to have one or the other do it, not both"
If you use isapnp tools, make sure your config looks like this:
#
# Plug and Play configuration
#
CONFIG_PNP=y
# CONFIG_ISAPNP is not set
