Nope.  Cisco-provided drivers (for 2.4-series kernels only) require a
firmware version of 5.30.17.  The in-kernel drivers for the 2.6 series
don't have the updates necessary to work with that version, and it
appears that versions of the firmware that are higher than 5.20.x will
not work for WEP using the in-kernel drivers.
I have personally tried 5.41 and 5.30.17 on a PCMCIA card and found they
do _not_ work with WEP.  I have also tried versions 5.00.01, 5.02.13,
5.00.03, and 5.20.07 (?) on both PCMCIA and MiniPCI cards and found them
to work correctly with WEP-enabled access points.
