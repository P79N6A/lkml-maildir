Not sure what BUG's you are talking about.

Well it seems that they are both mergeable since slabs larger than 64k * 
sizeof(void) are exempt from unmergeable processing and we get into issues 
because the merge policy is inconsistent for the larger slabs then.
Does this patch fix it?
Limit the maximum size of merged slab caches
We always switch off the debugging bits of slabs that are too large
for free pointer relocation. This means that we may create separate
caches even if slub_debug is set. Sysfs later thinks they are mergeable
and thus creates unique ids that may then clash.
