Sorry, I'm not following you there.   Perhaps your comment is saying
that second patch is pointless, because it forces allocations elsewhere
than the policy requires?  Rather than commenting on the line you quote?
(When I said I didn't know if the patch would have unwanted side-effects
I was rather wondering what happens when you ask the allocator to do
some impossible combination.)

Please just point us to the line where sys_move_pages enforces this.
