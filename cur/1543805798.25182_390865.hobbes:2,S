Test done here, few minutes ago. Added this to the wbsd driver in its
kmap routine:
    if ((host->cur_sg->offset + host->cur_sg->length) > PAGE_SIZE)
        printk(KERN_DEBUG "wbsd: Big sg: %d, %d\n",
            host->cur_sg->offset, host->cur_sg->length);
got:
[17385.425389] wbsd: Big sg: 0, 8192
[17385.436849] wbsd: Big sg: 0, 7168
[17385.436859] wbsd: Big sg: 0, 7168
[17385.454029] wbsd: Big sg: 2560, 5632
[17385.454216] wbsd: Big sg: 2560, 5632
And so on.
