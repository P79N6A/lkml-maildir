yes, we experimented the same absolutely reproducible behaviour, 
the system hangs - better, processes involving i/o hang - 
after a few timeouts and cannot be brought down other than hard resetting
it.
Our mileage can vary...
We use vanilla kernels on slackware-current distribution (see ver_linux in
previous post).
Tryed:
2.6.15
2.6.15.6
2.6.16-rc4
2.6.16-rc6
