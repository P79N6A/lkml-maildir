Some, but not all.  Some of the things necessary/desired for the kernel
build requires some ugly "neat hacks" to be put in there. (like the recorded
compile flags -- what would be called a configuration record in Clearcase.)

Yes, and they _still_ needlessly rebuild somethings every time make is called.

On my machines.  I've stared at the Makefile spooge for a decade, as have
a lot of people.  However, NO ONE has taken the time (I'm talking weeks of
doing nothing but screwing with Makefiles) to completely rewrite the build
system.  I do not enjoying doing such things even when I _am_ paid to do it.

ALL of them.  Everything is under subdirs of kernel which depmod isn't
scanning. (pcmcia is there by symlinks)

It's attitudes like that that have made Microsoft products a laughing stock.
A millisecond here and there adds up over time.  In case you've forgotten,
Linux _used_ to run very well on 386 and 486 systems (in the 25 to 50 MHz
range.)  What's the point in making processors faster if everyone just
wastes the increase being "correct and simple"?
