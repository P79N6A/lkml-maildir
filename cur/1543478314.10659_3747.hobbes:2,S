Obviously it recompiles, the compiler doesn't know that the change you made
may affect code in other parts of the program.  This is essential for a fast
code generating language.  And if your change doesn't affect the header file
(containing the class interface definitions) it doesn't affect all the other
files that use it during a compile.  Only way that this can be done on the
fly is with an interpited or partially interpited language.  Or a language
that wastes memory and CPU cycles storing or settings all the class
information at runtime.
