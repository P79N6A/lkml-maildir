Not if I can help it.  All the functionality you need already exists.
Each client mounts a common root filesystem.
A very early rc script mounts a per-client filesystem on
e.g. /perclient.
The rc script can use hostname or IP address or MAC address or
whatever it wants to choose the actual filesystem to mount:
   mount -t nfs -o nolocks server:/clientfilesys/`hostname` /perclient
Then any file that needs to be per-client becomes a symlink into
/perclient.
About the only thing that this doesn't work for is files the are
unlinked and re-created often.  I suspect if there are any of those
there is a workable solution.
