Larry, you tend to use words like 'company' and 'business' too much in
your messages... B-)
Suppose that I (definitely not a guru - I deal with the Linux kernel just
for fun, and I don't *need* any *professional* knowledge on it) find some
obscure bug (maybe I'm using some uncommon HW). I understand *nothing*
about the piece of kernel that actually BUG()s - probably it's the 
first time I see it. Nevertheless, I *like* kernel hacking. So I start
chasing the bug (and a debugger helps me a lot). It takes hours/days but
who cares? I'm having fun. Later I come up with a patch, which seems to
fix it. It may be complete crap. But I send a bug report *and* my patch
to Alan (or J. Kernel Mantainer). In a hour I get a reply back, saying:
"your patch is wrong, but I see the bug and I've fixed it in my tree"
(that's because *he* knows the code).
Don't you think that even random and clueless hacking can be (at times)
a valuable source of information for real hackers? That's very open
source specific, of course you don't run a *company* like that, but who
cares? Many of the lessons you learned in your business career
apply here, but some simply don't. The Linux kernel development isn't
run by someone that pays the bills...
