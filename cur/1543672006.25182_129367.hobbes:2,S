hi list,
we noticed that kernel_thread() returned diffent types. A quick
"grep -r kernel_thread() arch " will show pid_t, long and int
(for 2.4.20). So we started to clean up.
Everyone interessted can download the patches for 2.4.20 from
www.getenv.de/~walter
contact:
danielebellucci@libero.it
These are several patches. i dont want to bomb the ML so
no attachment to this mail.
As a first step we cleaned the definition in several architectures.
The changes are small as possible. Some architectures use pure asm
no understanding  -> no changes
The following architectures have changed:
sh i386 mips mips64 s390x s390 ia64 m68k 
changes occur in:
arch/<ARCH>/kernel/process.c    
< change return type kernel_thread() to  pid_t kernel_thread() >
include/asm-<ARCH>/processor.h
< add linux/types.h for pid_t >
< definiton change return type kernel_thread() to  pid_t kernel_thread() >
additionaly we started to clean the kernel
rch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c: 
changed type of sys_ptrace pid argument from to pid_t (original: long) 
include/linux/fs.h: 
changed type of pid member of struct fown_struct to pid_t (original: int) 
fs/proc/base.c: 
change type of pid variable in proc_pid_lookup to pid_t (original: unsigned int) [See Above] 
include/linux/sched.h: 
change type of find_task_by_pid argument (pid) from to pid_t (original: int) 
kernel/capability.c: 
in sys_capget: change type of pid variable to pid_t (original: int) 
in sys_capset: change type of pid variable to pid_t (original: int) 
kernel/signal.c: 
in sys_tkill: changed type of pid argument to pid_t (original: int)
