I've just released Linux 2.4.35.4.
It fixes very minor issues, but some patches have been resting here
for a long time, and there was no reason to hold them. Two minor
old vulnerabilities were fixed :
 - CVE-2006-5823 would cause the kernel to oops on specially crafted
   CRAMFS filesystems, though on 2.4.35 we never got more than an
   error in the logs. The fix was merged anyway.
 - CVE-2004-2731 corresponds to an incorrect size check in sparc's
   openprom driver. It was fixed in 2.5 but not in 2.4.
The patch and changelog will appear soon at the following locations:
