Hi !
I confirm a similar problem with 2.2.15pre9, 2.2.14aa[678].
I was FTPing from my notebook to an alphaserver running Digital Unix 4.0D, and
my network connection was terribly slow (13kB/s on a 100Mbps FD). I caught the
trace from tcpdump, but I've lost it in my /tmp during the reboot :-(.
As for Chris, we can see that there are long delays between each packet
exchange.
There has been something very strange with this alphaserver (which works
perfectly with any other systems : solaris, tru64, nt, older linux). It
sometimes has a strange way to ACK connections : it appears that when my
notebook (172.0.1.2) sends a SYN to this server (172.16.1.35), sometimes
this one replies with an ACK only without a SYN nor any RST. My linux then
sends RST to it and it works when trying again. May be I'm lacking some TCP/IP
knowledge but I didn't know about this method of ACKing connections.
I've tried to play with several parameters under /proc/sys/net/ipv4 without
success (not even a change in the inter-packet delay). I was used to write 0
to tcp_sack sometimes but I don't remember if I had to do this on versions
later than stock 2.2.14. Anyway, this doesn't work here.
I don't have permanent access to this alphaserver, but if someone suggests
patches, I can occasionnaly test them.
Regards,
Willy
Attached is a portion of tcpdump involving the strange ack :
