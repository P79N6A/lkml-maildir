I don't really like the shouting MARK name very much.  Can we have
a less-generic, less shouting name, e.g. trace_marker?  The aboe would then
be:
	trace_mark(blk_request_insert, "%p %p", q, rq);

just get rid of this and use ARRAY_SIZE diretly below.

just use an int for for loops.  it's easy to read and probably faster
on most systems (it the compiler isn't smart enough and promotes it
to int anyway during code generation)

kprobes does this kind of synchronization internally, so the marker
wrapper should probabl aswell.

no need to initialize this.

	if (--blk_probes_ref == 0)
		blk_probe_disconnect();
would probably be a tad cleaner.

Dito here with a:
	if (!blk_probes_ref++)
		blk_probe_connect();
also the connect in the name seems rather add, what about arm/disarm instead?

both should use DEFINE_MUTEX for compile-time initialization isntead.
Also it's probably better to put the trace points into blktrace.c,
that means all blktrace code can be static and self-contained.  And we
can probably do some additional cleanups by simplifying things later on.
