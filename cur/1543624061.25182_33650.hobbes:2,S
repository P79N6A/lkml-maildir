To apply the O(1) scheduler you only need to backout the dyn-sched and
numa-sched patches first (dyn-sched will be definitely obsoleted by the
O(1) scheduler, numa-sched should be changed like Mike described a few
weeks ago but probably O(1) will just work better than my current
numa-sched). There are no other changes to the scheduler, the
child-first is an optimization and parent-timeslice is an important
bugfix.
