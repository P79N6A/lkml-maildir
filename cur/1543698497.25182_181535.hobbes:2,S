Hi jeff! :)
One question - with "including hotplug", does that mean some set hotplug
standard? Reason I'm asking is, we have a few servers from SuperMicro,
with a ICH5R S-ATA controller that claims it's supporting hotplug, but
hotplug is not in your ICH5-summary.
PS, libata works great on those systems, good work!
