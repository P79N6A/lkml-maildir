Subject: [PATCH 3/6] UIO: fix up the UIO documentation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/28/352

From: Hans J Koch <hjk@linutronix.de>
Remove references to the old uio_dummy demo module from UIO documentation.
Add a small paragraph to make it clearer that UIO is not a universal driver
interface.
