Sounds to me like the flaw is in the ioctl(2) interface, in that it
doesn't allow passing all the block devices in the RAID set. If it
allowed you to pass all the block devices, then it could check if all
the signatures on each block device match.
I tried the alternative of setting persistent-superblock=0 in
/etc/raidtab, but the stupid thing complained because it found a
superblock. Sigh.
If there was only a "do as I say, regardless" mode, I would be happy.
This programmer-knows-best attitude smacks of M$.
