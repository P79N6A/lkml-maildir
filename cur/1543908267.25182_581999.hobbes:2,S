 Well, it looks like we have changed the rules at one point, so it is up 
to us to fix the things up.  Even if the glibc maintainers are persuaded 
to accept a change (which I might try to do), older versions are already 
out there and people may still want to use it for one reason or another 
(including myself -- I am not ready to move on with glibc and will have to 
stick to version 2.4 for several months yet).
