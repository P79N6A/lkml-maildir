If the change only affects buggy apps (as Thomas says), then it seems
completely obvious to me that the change should be made.
1. We'll be in compliance with the spec
2. Buggy applications will actually be helped by this by getting a
clear error instead of undefined behaviour silently hiding the fact
that they are buggy.
3. Correct applications are unaffected.
Seems like a no-brainer to me...
