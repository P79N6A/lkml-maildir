Right now, all architectures have "int" being 32-bit, so nothing should 
break. Apart from sign issues, of course.
If there are pointers and "long", then those should just not exist. Never
expose kernel pointers to user mode (and you really never should pass user
pointers back), and "long" should really just be "__u32" instead (since 
that is what it is on a 32-bit platform - and if it works there, then it 
should work on a 64-bit platform too).
