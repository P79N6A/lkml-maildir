It works for me - with pcnet_cs.  Do you have ipv6 configured into the
kernel?
Anyway, I'd be useful if you can reproduce the unkillable process, then
dump the task state (sysrq-t) and send the trace for the hung ifconfig
process.

This merely means that the driver tried to access some register and
found that the hardware was already gone.
