Subject: State of MD driver in 2.3.29 Question
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I am currently developing a new RAID level for md and would like to know the
current state of the md driver (and associated sub-drivers) in the latest
beta kernel. Would one of the developers/maintainers care to elaborate on
the state of md in this kernel. I've noticed significant changes from 2.2.x
series kernels.
On the same topic, are there any efforts underway to make md more modular
than it currently appears? The md driver code itself has a lot of
personality specific code requiring modifications to md.c et al to add other
RAID type algorithms to md. Any comments?
I would be happy to take this on if it's either considered desirable or not
already being done.
