Hello, (maybe a FAQ, but could not find this question)
is it possible with linux2.4 to limit the relative CPU time
per process or per UID? I saw something like this about 5
years ago on solaris machines, but I have not access to
solaris machines anymore. I do not mean limiting the
absolute CPU time (e.g. "the process should run 20minutes at
maximum and shall be killed after that time), but the
relative CPU time (e.g. "apache should consume at most 80%
of my servers CPU time and shall be throttled if it was to
consume more").
Thanx,
Xuân. :-)
