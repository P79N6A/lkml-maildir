Nah, if that were a factor of 100, then it should have been in the OEM
manuals, no?
Besides that, although my small sample is not representative, I have
older drives still alive & kicking - an MTBF of 1/100 of what the vendor
stated would mean the chance of failure way above 90 % by now, the drive
has seen 22,000 POH with write cache off and has been a system drive for
like 14,000 POH. So?

See the problem: "I assume", "IIRC selected...". There is no
list of corroborated facts which systems work and which don't. I have
made several attempts in compiling one, posting public calls for data
here, no response.
I don't blame you personally, but the lack of documentation about such
crucial facts or generally documentation in Linux environments in general.
