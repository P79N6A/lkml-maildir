i m a relatively newbie to kernel-2.6.x. But i have
information that suggests that kernel-2.6.x has got
soft real-time capabilities.
So how-to write a simple program(may be a Hello world
program) which has real-time capabilities. I require
it for writing a program on kernel-2.6.x that uses the
soft real-time capabilities.
Any help in this matter will be highly appreciated.
Abhinav.
