Yes, the filenames are unchanged.  But if you modprobe snd-mixer-oss,
you'll see snd_mixer_oss in /proc/modules.  But rmmod "snd-mixer-oss"
works as expected.  Basically, the kernel and tools see them as
equivalent: anything else is a bug, please report.
BTW, this was done for (1) simplicity, (2) so KBUILD_MODNAME can be
used to construct identifiers, and (3) so parameters when the module
is built-in have a consistent name.
Hope that clarifies!
Rusty.
