Please DON'T do that -- not all machines support this access mechanism
and even on them directly poking the I/O ports would lead to races with
other programs and as well with the kernel.
Either use lspci (which has a nice machine-parseable output mode) or
parse /proc/bus/pci/devices or use the libpci library (part of the
pciutils package).
				Have a nice fortnight
