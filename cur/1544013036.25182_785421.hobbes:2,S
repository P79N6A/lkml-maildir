"tracing_on" is not a function call, so nesting does not make sense.
It is a file in debugfs, and therefore an end user interface. I am only
talking about the debugfs files, not functions. Only developers use
functions and devels can be expected to find the implementation and
read the fine documentation.
How about /debug/tracing/recording with values 0 and 1?
That would be a clear distinction to /debug/tracing/tracing_enabled.
I have also wondered about the "tracing_" prefix, the files are
already in the tracing/ directory.
I am just trying to think what file names would make sense in
debugfs. I completely agree with you on function naming, but should
the file have the same name as the function? Sure, for developers
it would be easier to remember, but the name might not make any
sense unless you know the internal implementation.
If something else than tracing starts to use the ring buffer
facility, we have to think about the names again. Until then,
just my 2c. :-)
Thanks.
