Hello list,
    This driver works :o)
    running hdparm gives those results :
    Timing buffered disk reads:  170 MB in  3.00 seconds =  56.60 MB/sec 
(with 2.6.4-bk4 and sata_sil.c try 3)
    Timing buffered disk reads:  170 MB in  3.01 seconds =  56.56 MB/sec 
(with 2.6.4-mm2)
    running boonie on the 2.6.4-mm2 version hangs the computer, with no 
possibilities of doing anything (can't even use the magic SysRq keys), 
while on the 2.6.4-bk4 version using the patched version of sata_sil.c 
it doesn't exactly hang : it is still possible to switch from one 
console to another, but it's impossible to log into any of them (after 
typing in the password, you never get the prompt).
    here is the command I used :
    bonnie++ -u jdidron -d /tmp -x 10 -s 2g -n 32:30000:5:500 -m
