Dear Russel,
I have a full-fledged driver working with NO problems. It has been
developed long back.
Now the issue here is to add the partitions support to the existing
driver.
I guess it will involve enough amount of work. If NOT, please provide me
the documentation if available, HOW-TO use the MMC layer.
If the requirement was BIG & bulky what you suggested might have been
apt.
If I can solve it in less effort why go for more effort.
I can always integrate it with main-steam kernel letter. This is the
PEAK time & I am required to submit the patch as soon as possible.
Please understand the reason behind it.
I assure you that I will use the kernel MMC & accomplish what u said
within  next month?
But for now how to implement the partition support in the driver will be
very helpfull.
Thanks & Regards,
Mukund Jampala
