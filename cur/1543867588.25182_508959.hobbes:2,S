  OK, thanks. Then I'm slightly confused as the offset 0x2d in struct
buffer_head is somewhere in b_assoc_buffers which is never dereferenced.
Can you run gdb on vmlinux from the 2.6.20 kernel and send me the output
of 'disass walk_page_buffers'? Thanks.

   Great.

  Yes, that's it.

  git bisect bad v2.6.20
  git bisect good v2.6.17
(or maybe you could start with 'git bisect bad v2.6.19' if that was also
failing for you). Git will spit out something like:
Bisecting: 9467 revisions left to test after this
[ebdea46fecae40c4d7effcd33f40918a37a1df4b] Merge branch 'devel' of master.kernel.org:/home/rmk/linux-2.6-arm
After you test kernel from the revision
'ebdea46fecae40c4d7effcd33f40918a37a1df4b', you do
  git bisect good/bad ebdea46fecae40c4d7effcd33f40918a37a1df4
and you'll get next revision to check. I hope it's clearer now.
