Yeah, yeah, my fingers get confused. I type "Linux" and "Linus" 
interchangably, and _most_ of the time I notice, but then at other times I 
don't look closely enough at what I wrote, so something slips through. 
And sometimes when my right hand is off by a key, I'm Kubys.
My fingers have minds all their own.
