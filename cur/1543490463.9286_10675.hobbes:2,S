AHEM! This from linux/Documentation/Changes

SMBfs
=====
   To mount SMB (Samba / Windows) shares, you'll need to use the
smbmount utility included with release 2.0 of Samba.
Documentation/filesystems/smbfs.txt has more information about this.
Note that smbmount must have been built against 2.2 headers to work
with 2.2; if all else fails, recompile it and hope it works ;-).  In
addition, Mike Warfield has a script and some information at
http://www.wittsend.com/mhw/smbmount.html
 that you will probably find
useful.
---end paste
Please read this file through and update all other programs you need to
before writing here again with such a problem.
Thanks,
Paul Laufer
