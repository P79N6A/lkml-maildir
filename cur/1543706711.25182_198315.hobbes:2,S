Aside from the spelling & wording problems already commented on

MF>  ... Anyway, here goes:
 
The above introductory paragraph needs to be rewritten if you
plan to start using CodingStyle document to record the developer
community consensus.  The words "I" and "my" used here refer to
Linus and Linus only; IIRC, the coding style document originates
from an old posting by him to the l-k mailing list, and the
intent was to express view of Linus so that he does not have to
get involved in coding style flamewar on l-k list every time.
----------------------------------------------------------------
MF> +Note that perhaps the most terrible way to write code is to put multiple

MF> +	if (condition) do_this;
I do not think this particular one agrees with community
consensus yet.  If "do_this" is short and sweet, I would not be
surprised if Linus said it is perfectly fine.
If the community indeed wants to ban a short single statement as
the body of an "if" statement, I would rather write the bad
example as this:
    if (condition) never_do_this;
----------------------------------------------------------------
MF> +Lagging spaces are deprecated.
You probably meant "trailing spaces".  In addition to that you
may also want to say something about <SP>s before <TAB>.
----------------------------------------------------------------

This example violates indent by tab rule (notice spaces before "else").
----------------------------------------------------------------

I believe this goes against community consensus not to overuse
parentheses.  Linus and others are also against "if ((a = b)) {
... }" (place extra parens around assignment expression used as
boolean), which is what GCC suggests (and which indeed is a
stupid suggestion).
----------------------------------------------------------------
MF> +Periods terminating kernel messages are deprecated
MF> +Usage of the apostrophe <'> in kernel messages is deprecated
I do not think encouraging bad spelling like above has reached
community consensus.  Personally I do not like those sloppy
grammar ("donts" and missing period at the end of the sentence).
Encouraging people to be consistent is a good thing, but I do
not want to encourage people to be consistently sloppy.
