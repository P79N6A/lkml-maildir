hi Jeff,
this patch is used to set the SATA controller back to AHCI mode when ATI SB700 is set 
as combined mode or legacy IDE mode by BIOS, without this patch, just like ATI SB600, 
the SB700 SATA device will fail in these two modes.
BRs,
henry

hmmmm.  The patch looks OK, but your description seems to indicate that
the patch is not needed?
