No one's expended any serious time on it at all, it looks like, other than 
discussion.
I see the one comment says that it can be done with lio_listio(3RT) (apparently 
in LIO_WAIT mode), and that interface does seem to offer all the preadv/pwritev
functionality.  That's not to say that we shouldn't implement preadv/pwritev 
literally, just that there should be a way to get that sort of functionality today.
