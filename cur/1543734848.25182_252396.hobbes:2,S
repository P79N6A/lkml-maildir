Hi Tonnerre,
I believe that is what Richard is talking about as well. When pci_get_device
is in a while loop the dereference is done automatically. See the code and 
comments.
You will notice in the sys_alcor.c patch I did add the pci_dev_put (although
in the wrong place, new patch coming soon).
Regards,
Hanna
