Not really. If you see my subsequent patch, the idea is to introduce a
single generic hard_irq_disable() which is meant to be called with
irqs already disabled (that is within a local_irq_disable section) to
enforce that if the arch does lazy disabling, it gets hard disabled
at this point.
If we start adding hard_irq_enable() we end up in a can of worms:
 - Do we want all the full set of save/restore etc... ?
 - What if somebody does hard_enable while we are soft-disabled
   -and- have been hard disabled because of a pending interrupt ?
 - What's the point ? :-)
So overall, I want to keep the semantics as simple as they can be. Maybe
I can even add some WARN_ON() to make sure we are in a
local_irq_disable'd section even in the generic one instead of just a
NOP to enfore that.
Cheers,
Ben.
