The input buffer is "const char * buf". I will have to override the
const to zero it out.

I'll put one together to trim leading/trailing white space from the
buffer before it is passed into the attribute functions. Now that I
think about this I believe the attributes should have always had the
leading/trailing white space removed. If we don't do it in the sysfs
code then every driver has to do it.
