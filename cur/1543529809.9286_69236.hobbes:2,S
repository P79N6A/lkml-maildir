For some reason I cannot connect to my ISP. I get a connection but the
login fails. I think it is the bsd compression changes, but can't be
sure.
I had been connecting from 2.3.52-1, but tried backing up (including
restoring /lib/modules to the 2.3.52-1 state), but oddly that did not
cure the problem.
On another note, the shm note in IPC to add stuff the fstab should also
say that you have to create the mount point in /var. I presume just
mkdir /var/shm
is sufficient. It seemed to work for me.
