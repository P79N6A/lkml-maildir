    Unless PCMCIA card services can detect the cdrom;  If I have to
    manually tweak a kernel, that means my installer is broken.
    I'd much rather do heroic things inside the kernel and a lilo'ed or
    syslinux'ed install floppy than put things on the command line,
    because once I've got the code doing it, it's not something I have
    to remember.   I don't like having to resort to memory or digging
    through megabytes of documentation when I am personally responsible
    for maintaining Linux on the abovementioned Sony, a HP Omnibook
    5700, a Thinkpad 701c, a NEC Versa 2000C, a noname Pentinum
    notebook, a Compaq luggable (386/25 w/ 10mb), a Panasonic all-in-one
    LCD box, yet another Sony, about 40 server/workstation machines, and
    a few 386sx regression carcasses.
