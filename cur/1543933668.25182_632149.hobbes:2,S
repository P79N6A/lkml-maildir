> V1->V2:
> - add support for PER_CPU_ATTRIBUTES
> 
> Add the ability to use generic/percpu even if the arch needs to override
> several aspects of its operations. This will enable the use of generic
> percpu.h for all arches.
> 
> An arch may define:
> 
> __per_cpu_offset	Do not use the generic pointer array. Arch must
> 			define per_cpu_offset(cpu) (used by x86_64, s390).
> 
> __my_cpu_offset		Can be defined to provide an optimized way to determine
> 			the offset for variables of the currently executing
> 			processor. Used by ia64, x86_64, x86_32, sparc64, s/390.
> 
> SHIFT_PTR(ptr, offset)	If an arch defines it then special handling
> 			of pointer arithmentic may be implemented. Used
> 			by s/390.
> 
> 
> (Some of these special percpu arch implementations may be later consolidated
> so that there are less cases to deal with.)
