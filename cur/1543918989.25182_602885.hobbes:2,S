Hello,
I'am the developer of the subset of Linux API on windows.
Pretty much all system calls were "wrapped" up to the the latest
kernel native AIO support.
While compiling/running test program natively on Linux
(2.6.18-8.1.10.el5)
I've got hit by undocumented limitations of AIO system:
* aio support only for files opened with O_DIRECT
* alignment issues/data sizes for O_DIRECT-opened files
* special cases like extending file, reading meatadata
  also seem to block.
I was glad to find out that a work was done to overcome this:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/suparna/aio/
The only thing that concerns me is that the 2007 year
patches are all against release candidates, and the latest
one was released more than 7 months ago.
So I'am looking for the status update.
Any current plans/interest to finally include this in latest
trees?
Or this was taken down in favour of servlets?
Regards,
