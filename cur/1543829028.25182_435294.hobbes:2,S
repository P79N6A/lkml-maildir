Right, that may be the right question.  If that's the case, then the
problem is really include/linux/sched.h:__mmdrop() which is what's
calling destroy_context().  Separating that out becomes a pretty
big patch affecting at least all mmput() and mmdrop() callers.

So we can either go through all arch's and make sure destroy_context is
safe for invalid context, or split mmput() and destroy_context()...
The former seems easier, but the latter seems more robust in the face of
future code changes I guess.
