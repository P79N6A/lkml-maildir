Pseudo code: make install, modules-install etc. depend on other targets
if and only if there are multiple targets on the command line.  A bare
make install will have no dependencies on vmlinux, make install plus
other targets will wait for the other targets.  Mind you, I still think
that removing the dependency to avoid root turds is the wrong approach.
goal := $(sort $(MAKECMDGOALS))
goal_install := $(filter %install,$(goal))
goal_other := $(filter-out %install,$(goal))
ifneq ($(goal_install),)
  ifneq ($(goal_other),)
    $(goal_install): $(goal_other)
  endif
endif
