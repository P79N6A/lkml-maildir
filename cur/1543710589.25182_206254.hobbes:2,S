I think you need to work with the openib.org people as they seem to
have:
	- working code with support for a number of different devices
	- developers with extensive kernel programming experience
	  working on cleaning up the code to fit properly into the
	  kernel tree.
	- their code showing up in at least one distro which will expose
	  them to a much wider range of testing than Intel's project so
	  far has had.
So it seems that you really need to work with them if you wish to get
your code merged into theirs, as theirs already seems to be an almost
complete solution...
Good luck,
greg k-h
