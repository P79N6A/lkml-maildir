From what I seen (pc87108, tir2000), even at MIR/FIR speeds hardware
looks like serial with length-of-packet added. I actually implemented
tir2000 FIR driver as tty - it adds frame begining/end when it
absolutely musts. Being tty has certain advantages in my eyes: most
interesting is "i'm able to test it with simple commands like cat and
echo". Also, being tty I could try to run something else than irda
over that line (for example scarab).

Is it possible to write tty-over-netdevice driver? I would quite like
to be able to transfer data over point-to-point ethernet using zmodem
protocol ;-).
