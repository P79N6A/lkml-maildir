Not the goals.  I haven't seen the *problem* yet.

That's a real problem, and I sympathise with the idea of marking symbols as 
externally useful (or, practically, mark internal).
But we now need to decide what's "externally useful".  The currently line for 
exports is simple: someone in-tree needs it.  You dislike the suggestion to 
extend this to "if more than one in-tree needs it it's open".
Currently your criterion seems to be "does the maintainer hate external 
modules?" which I don't think will be what you want...
Cheers,
Rusty.
