I protest.  There are at least 3 vowels and 2 non-acronyms in this
function name.  Also, 6 arguments is clearly too few.  Can we not also

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
