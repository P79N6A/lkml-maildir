READA just returns - I doubt that the aio functions should poll until
there are free entries in the request queue.
The pending aio requests should be "included" into the wait_for_requests
waitqueue (ok, they don't have a process context, thus a wait queue
entry doesn't help, but these requests belong into that wait queue)
