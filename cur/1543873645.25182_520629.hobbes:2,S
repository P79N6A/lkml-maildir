I recall kexecing a bzImage for x86_64 on i386, but I'm not 100% sure.
I think it worked because the bzImage loader code was regular 32 bit
x86 code, but that may be wrong as well.

Right. And maybe it's a good idea to make sure that this feature is
actually supported by kexec-tools before adding code to the kernel?
My gut feeling about this is that you are begging for trouble. The
kexec/kdump solution is fragile just by itself, and trying to go
between architectures is just going to be painful.
