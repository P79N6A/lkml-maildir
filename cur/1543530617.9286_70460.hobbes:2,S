It must be balanced.  Both extremes are daft :)  Big updates to popular
drivers, containing lots of changes, are equally untenable.

Sure.  But the facts of the situation are that updates were not
occurring for the 2.3.x drivers, before I started doing them.  A few
drivers, like eepro100, were getting updated by outsiders, but not
many.  And none to the currently-stable levels of the 2.2.x series,
which gets the majority of bug reports and fixes.
I don't care how Donald works or what he does when he works.  I care
about the Linux kernel.  And when net drivers go unmaintained for a long
time, something needs to happen.

Um, please read the entire thread, take a look at Linux kernel
development.  I currently maintain the tulip and rtl-8139 drivers in the
2.3.x kernels, and many other net drivers have also been updated by me
in recent kernels (softnet and hotplug updates and bug fixes, for
example)
I _am_ taking the responsibility, because no one else is doing so.

Write all the poetry you want.  :)  You still cannot argue with the fact
that net drivers were not getting updated, because Donald's method of
development and the Linux kernel method of development are increasing
incompatible.
You can do cathedral development for one driver, or two.  No problem. 
But maintaining a large number of the most popular net drivers means you
are leaving people in the lurch for months at a time.  During a kernel
development series, that creates a fundamental problem.  If a net core
change occurs which breaks net drivers, as happened during 2.3.x, the
most popular net drivers remain broken and completely unusable until
Donald updates all of them.
It is not fair for users to expect Donald to update and test everything
immediately, but nor is it fair for hackers and users of devel kernels
to wait MONTHS until a suitable fix for all his drivers is available. 
That impedes the progress of the entire kernel.

Incorrect.  In the case of the big tulip update, these are people for
whom tulip driver has always worked, and then after the update, it
doesn't.  This is all well-documented on linux-kernel and elsewhere.
