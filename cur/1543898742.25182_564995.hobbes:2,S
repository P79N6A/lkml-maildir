Yes; currently we require userspace to offline all cpus other than the
boot cpu before initiating the suspend.
The main difficulty is actually that SMP powermacs that can suspend
tend to have video cards that get powered off in suspend.  We know how
to re-initialize one (the Radeon RV100 QW) but not others.  That's an
orthogonal issue to the issues we have been discussing, though.
