The protocol is simply to do best to give credit where credit is due. 
If your patch is taken directly, most likely it is a mistake if 
attribution was dropped.  If your patch was modified, often that patch 
will get checked in under the name of the person who last touched the 
change before commit -- and it is their responsibility to make sure and 
note that the change originally came from you.
