Subject: [KEXEC][2.5.60] Success Report

The same configuration of kexec that I have used successfully with
2.5.58 and 2.5.59 on my uniproc crash system also works when patched
into 2.5.60.
The current patch stack that I am using is now available in OSDL's patch
manager:
kexec base for 2.5.60 (based upon the version for 2.5.54):

kexec hwfixes that make it work for me (same as for 2.5.5[89]):
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1468
I have no new data to report on that oops sighting with kexec +
2.5.{59,60} on MP systems...
