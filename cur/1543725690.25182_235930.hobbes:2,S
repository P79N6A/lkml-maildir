As a dumb end user, what reason would you have for wishing to grab a
kernel.org kernel? A true "dumb end user" cares about the applications
they intend to run and doesn't give a hoot about the kernel. Provided
that the kernel supports the applications they wish to use, and it's
stable, it should not be relevant. There are people out there using
Linux 2.0.X, 2.2.X, 2.4.X etc. etc. and who are perfectly happy because
it does what they need it to do. If you care about the latest 2.6.X
kernel version, you're *not* "a dumb end user" :-)
Anyway, as hpa kindly pointed out, the 2.6.X kernels are still intended
to be stable. The proving ground will be in the -mm series. So carry on
using 2.6.X and be happy. It's been a great deal more stable than 2.4.X
was for a long time at least for me.
Regards,
Tim
