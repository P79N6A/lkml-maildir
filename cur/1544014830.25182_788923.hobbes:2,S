I think we want to - if you have multiple CPU's and a heavily contended 
lock that acts as a spinlock, we still _do_ want to keep spinning even if 
another CPU gets the lock.
And I don't even believe that is the bug. I suspect the bug is simpler. 
I think the "need_resched()" needs to go in the outer loop, or at least 
happen in the "!owner" case. Because at least with preemption, what can 
happen otherwise is
 - process A gets the lock, but gets preempted before it sets lock->owner.
   End result: count = 0, owner = NULL.
 - processes B/C goes into the spin loop, filling up all CPU's (assuming 
   dual-core here), and will now both loop forever if they hold the kernel 
   lock (or have some other preemption disabling thing over their down()).
And all the while, process A would _happily_ set ->owner, and eventually 
release the mutex, but it never gets to run to do either of them so.
In fact, you might not even need a process C: all you need is for B to be 
on the same runqueue as A, and having enough load on the other CPU's that 
A never gets migrated away. So "C" might be in user space.
I dunno. There are probably variations on the above.
