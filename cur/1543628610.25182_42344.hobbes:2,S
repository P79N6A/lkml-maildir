I had the same problem on 2.5.7, and now when I'm trying to boot off 2.5.9 
with initrd it is going wrong. Last messages issued are (not exactly)
RAMDISK compressed image found at block 0
Freeing unused initrd memory (96k)
cramfs: bad magic
PANIC cannot mount root
It looks like it's freeing initrd memory before running it. initrd fs is 
cramfs, but using romfs i had exactly the same thing (it was also cramfs: 
bad magic)
