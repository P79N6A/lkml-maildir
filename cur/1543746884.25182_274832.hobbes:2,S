Hi,
I am sending and receiving data using socket buffers. On the receiving 
end, I have registered a packet handler using dev_add_pack() and am only 
processing packets of type PACKET_HOST. Now I want to read the source 
MAC address of the incoming packets, and I am using memcpy(src, 
(skb->mac.ethernet + 6), 6). However, when I try to print the value of 
src, I am getting garbage data. Can anyone help?
Thanks
Josef E. Galea
