AFIACS, yes.

Yes, tricky.  On the one hand, we shouldn't break the ABI.  On the
other hand, POSIX.1 is explicit in disallowing the case that would
lead the ABI change made by this patch.  (For what it is worth, the
man page was released at pretty much the same time as the syscall, and
has always documented that the return value on success was 0, and
Vegard was the first person to report this case that deviated from the
doc.)

Ack.
