Speaking of PCI... are we gonna have to zap __devinit too?  Another 
option is to think of add-new-pci-ids-on-the-fly as a CONFIG_HOTPLUG 
feature, which should(?) maintain the current __devinit semantics: no 
re-probes.
OTOH, __devinit already is a no-op for CONFIG_HOTPLUG cases (read: most 
everybody), so I wonder if we care enough about __devinit anymore?  I 
used the same logic to support __devinitdata removal, after all.
