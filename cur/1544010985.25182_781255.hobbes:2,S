There seems to be some confusion.
I want aggregate instruction count.  I do not want any sort of scaling or 
sampling.
When I cound retired instructions and cycles, I want the full counts for 
those.  The q6600 definitely has more than 2 counters available, so it 
should be able to give me exact aggregate counts for those counters.  No 
sampling or scaling should be involved.
Is it not possible to get raw, aggregate count with Ingo's infrastructure? 
The documentation is vague on this.
