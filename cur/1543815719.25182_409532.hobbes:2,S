I'd like to bring people's attention to the work done on ALSA ASoC.
Some information is available at:
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/patches/alsa/info.html
(I think there are more supported codecs now.)
Patches are at:
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/patches/alsa/
I've cc'd Liam in on this.
The PXA Zaurus machines are going down this route for audio support and
its proving extremely functional and stable. Mainline inclusion is
likely and there has been discussion about ASoC on the ALSA mailing
lists.
