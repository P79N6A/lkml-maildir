Frankly, I believe that it is both illegal (by the GPL) and morally  
bankrupt to add these "GPL only" symbols to the kernel *unless* you can  
get agreement for them fro *all* kernel copyright holders.
Which I predict you won't get.
That is, except when you handle the "_GPL" as a meaningless adornment.
