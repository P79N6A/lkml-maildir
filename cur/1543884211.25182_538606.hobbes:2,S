Yes, a very GOOD question, considering:
REISER4 - THE BEST FILESYSTEM EVER.

Column one measures the time taken to complete the bonnie++ benchmarking
test (run with the parameters bonnie++ -n128:128k:0). The top two
results use Reiser4 with compression. Since bonnie++ writes test files
which are almost all zeros, compression speeds things up dramatically.
That this is not the case in real world examples can be seen below where
compression does not speed things up. However, more importantly, it does
not slow things down either.
Column two, Disk Usage: measures the amount of disk used to store 655MB
of raw data (which was 3 different copies of the Linux kernel sources).

Each test was preformed 5 times and the average value recorded.
Disk Usage: The amount of disk used to store the data (which was 3
different copies of the Linux kernel sources).
The raw data (without filesystem meta-data, block alignment wastage,
etc) was 655MB.
Copy 655MB (1): Copy the data over a partition boundary.
Copy 655MB (2): Copy the data within a partition.
Tar Gzip 655MB: Tar and Gzip the data.
Unzip UnTar 655MB: UnGzip and UnTar the data.
Del 2.5 Gig: Delete everything just written (about 2.5 Gig).
