My point was that the module core code itself is a portion of the kernel
that uses sysfs that is a "non-driver" bit of code.  Thus proving that
you do not have to be a driver, or device, or bus, to use sysfs easily.

Ok, thanks for explaining this better.  That makes more sense.
What other, specific sysfs files are you going to want to create?
What is the hierarchy going to look like?
What is the contents of the file going to look like?

I think this is happening as you are trying to port your code that
currently uses /proc (and file names there) to use sysfs instead, right?
To do this correctly, you need to stop thinking about file names and
paths, and start thinking about the hierarchy and relationship between
the files, which will allow you to create a tree of kobjects easier.
If you answer the questions above, I think we can work to figure this
out.

Just because you have to make a hypervisor call to get the value of the
attribute behind a sysfs file, does not make it any different from
anything else we currently have in sysfs.  It just will make the race
conditions easier to hit in your code as I imagine you will be sleeping
in the show functions more often than other parts of the kernel :)

Well, for things like this, that interact with the rest of the kernel,
it's good to work with the kernel community too, as you are doing.  I'm
happy to see this start to happen, hopefully other portions of Xen will
start tricking out this way also (same thing happened a few weeks ago
with some USB stuff.)

I don't.  You are creating a generalized wrapper around a globally
available kernel subsystem.  Don't you think that others could want to
use it, or that it hasn't been created yet for some reason?

And also please fix your email client to post patches properly.  I guess
I should be happy you didn't try to post them using Notes :)
thanks,
