Just ran the discovery script on 2.6.13.mm2, there's roughly 1609 
symbols unused in pci_ids.h, another 1030 are defined throughout the 
source tree, leaving 729 in pci_ids.h.  Total unique symbols is 1030.
Not counted are macro defined symbols: 
PCI_DEVICE_ID_##id
PCI_DEVICE_ID_##v##_##d
PCI_DEVICE_ID_BROOKTREE_##chip
PCI_VENDOR_ID_##v
from:
linux-2.6.13-mm2/drivers/video/cirrusfb.c
linux-2.6.13-mm2/sound/oss/ymfpci.c
linux-2.6.13-mm2/sound/pci/bt87x.c
What is the goal here?  Is a comment stripped, non-duplicate pci_ids.h 
with a reference to source site okay? 
Should the various distributed defines be collected to the one header 
file and that header be include'd to those files?  It seems pci_ids.h 
is redundant.
Thanks,
Grant.
