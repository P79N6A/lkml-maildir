OK Here goes.
I have a Jetway J-542B MB with 64MB RAM and a K6-2/333 CPU. I am running
kernel 2.3.37. 
00:00.0 Host bridge: Acer Laboratories Inc. M1541 (rev 04)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: Acer Laboratories Inc.: Unknown device 5243 (rev 04)
00:07.0 ISA bridge: Acer Laboratories Inc. M1533 (rev b4)
00:0f.0 IDE interface: Acer Laboratories Inc. M5229 (rev 20)
From dmesg I have,
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.21
ALI15X3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 78
ALI15X3: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
hda: Maxtor 90680D4, ATA DISK drive
hdc: QUANTUM FIREBALL CX10.2A, ATA DISK drive
hdd: TAEIL CDD-7320T, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
ALI15X3: MultiWord DMA enabled
hda: Maxtor 90680D4, 2014MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=826/255/63, (U)DMA
ALI15X3: MultiWord DMA enabled
hdc: QUANTUM FIREBALL CX10.2A, 9787MB w/418kB Cache, CHS=19885/16/63, (U)DMA
hdd: ATAPI 20X CD-ROM drive, 128kB Cache
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.06
After booting hdparm /dev/hda gives,
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
So far, so good?
Here are my hdparm -tT /dev/hda results, 
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  3.04 seconds =42.11 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  9.73 seconds = 6.87 MB/sec
I am disappointed by the 6.87MB/sec. Shouldn't it be much more? With
using_dma=0 I get 4-5MB/sec. NB: The Maxtor HD is a UDMA/Mode2 device and
its specs say, 
	DATA TRANSFER RATE:
	  To/From Interface: ....................... Up to 33.0 MBs
	  To/From Media: ........................... Up to 18.6 MBs
A couple of supplementary points/questions: My kernel is reporting
'ALI15X3: MultiWord DMA enabled' rather than 'ALI15X3: Ultra DMA enabled'
as Meelis' does. Any ideas why? 
According to Western Digital's UDMA info webpage, 'multiword DMA mode 2'
should give a max. data-rate of 16.6MB/sec - much more than I get.

This is very similar to the figure I get...

Any Suggestions ??
Thanks
Tom.
