The per-spinlock cost I was refering to is the cost of the inc/dec per 
spinlock.  I guess this cost is small enough as to be hard to measure, but
I have not tried so I don't know.  Curiously, none of the people I've heard
making pronouncements on the overhead of your preempt patch seem to have 
measured it either.
