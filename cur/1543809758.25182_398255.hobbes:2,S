Yes. Using scsicam_bios_parm and other defaults result in a geometry of
64 heads and 32 sectors even for big disks, which is not what the pc bios
"gets" from the controller. That is more along the lines of 255/63.
Returning a geometry of x/255/63 seems to be the default for bigger disks
withing scsi drivers, so i just copied the code...
