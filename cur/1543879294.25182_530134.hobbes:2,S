It was - bus masters were accessed through generic find_bus() via
device/driver model, bus master has links to all devices found on
controlled bus.
But find_bus() was removed, so there is no such mechanism right now.
I have no objections against this driver, feel free to add my ack (when
trivialities described are resolved) or I can push w1 part myself.
