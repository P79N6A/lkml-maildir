But how do you quantify "a long time"? And what happens if process A is
a very high priority and which nothing else is allowed to run?

OK, but other valid examples were offered up - lock inversion avoidance,
and externally driven systems (ie. where it is not known which lock will
be taken next).

Wrong. It will obviously occur if the lower priority process is able
to take a lock before a higher priority process.
The situation will not exist in "the scenario" though, if we follow
my reading of the spec, because *the scheduler* determines the next
process to gain the mutex. This makes perfect sense to me.

Any kind of priority boost / inherentance like this is orthogonal to
the issue. They still do not prevent B from acquiring the mutex and
thereby blocking the execution of the higher priority A. I think this
is against the spirit of the spec, especially the part where it says
*the scheduler* will choose which process to gain the lock.
