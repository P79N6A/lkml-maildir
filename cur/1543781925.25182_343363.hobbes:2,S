Hm. It sounds like you'd configured PAM to require the pam_loginuid
module even though you didn't have auditing enabled in your kernel. That
seems strange and wrong to me, and _is_ a userspace problem.
I'd also agree that it shouldn't have changed with the new kernel though
-- and I can't think of anything I changed recently which would have
that effect. An strace would still be useful.
Can you double-check that you didn't have auditing enabled in your
older, working kernel?
