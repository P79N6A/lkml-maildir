Thanks for the thoughtful reply.  _And_ for taking the time to look at
the code.
I guess my half-assed notion is to have a single file w/"#ifdef-able"
entries that flag API changes.  It at least would give me/us a single
point of reference, and avoid the rather ugly version checking.  "LDDx"
is fine, and lwn.net has saved my ass more times than I can count, but a
single peg on which to hang my out-of-tree hat would seem useful.
Thanks again,
Bill
