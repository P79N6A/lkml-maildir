Hello,
I have seen a brief error using ifconfig :
/tmp > ifconfig
: error fetching interface information: Device not found
Then, a second later :
/tmp > ifconfig

I am running kernel 2.2.2-ac7.
====================================================================
Another thing is the NFS mount time. I am using autofs to automount
my NFS partitions.
After the idle time, the partitions are umounted. That's OK.
When I access a umounted partition again, it takes sometimes up to 10
seconds to mount the partition.
I have rebooted to test it with a 2.2.1-ac3, and it takes around 1 second.
Back to 2.2.2-ac7, and it takes 10 seconds.
Next (worst) thing, as mentionned two days ago, I may receive some
corrupted data when compiling over a NFS server (in that case,
a 2.2.1-ac3 box running knfsd). It never happened using a 2.2.1-ac3
kernel. Sometimes, data looks like the content of the termcap file.
Sometimes, the shell does not find the '.' directory.
And, in a general manner, compilation that took around 19/20 minutes
with 2.2.1-ac3 now takes 27 or more minutes.
Have anyone else observed the phenomenum ?
Thanks,
A+
