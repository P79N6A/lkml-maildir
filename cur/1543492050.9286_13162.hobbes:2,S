  The last 3 times I did cdda2wav, I crashed it.  The first one I was also
running bladeenc.  The next two it was just cdda2wav alone while I watched
'toons.  My CD and HD are on different IDE controllers.
  I'd say do something that isn't I/O bound (which isn't hard on IDE drives
since they eat CPU).
