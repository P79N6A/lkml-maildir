I do trust that Jakub is correct, but I still want to convice myself
before changing the code. I don't want to make some silly mistake.

Ok. I'm still reading the code and tracing code paths.  This is slow work
for me since I'm not intimately familliar with these functions (nor with
kernel code in general).  I'll get there, but I'll be getting there in
small incremental steps..

Creating a sepperate function is certainly preferable to having duplicate
code in two functions. But I did not want to do that just yet - I wanted
to get confirmation that the checks where correct and ensure that they
really were needed in load_elf_interp before doing that.
