It only been two days and it seems appropriate to refer
to Martin Petersen's summation of persistent naming issues again:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=101840990116069&w=2
As for "scsihosts" its current syntax is:
 scsihosts=aic7xxx:sym53c8xx::aic7xxx
This could be extended to
  scsihosts=aic7xxx[pci=00:0c.0]:sym53c8xx::aic7xxx
and if "pci=" was assumed to be the default then this
would have the same effect as:
  scsihosts=[00:0c.0]:sym53c8xx::aic7xxx
assuming there was a aic7xxx controlled HBA at that PCI slot.
No consistent persistence here, just a little more precision.

You can say that again. Joerg Schilling is still some way
from getting it right in cdrecord, SANE still has problems
in this area (and I rewrote the scsi scanning code). Kurt
and I have a fair amount of experience in this particular 
area. There are lots of gotchas ...
Kurt's implementation is worthy of note as well. When I have
pondered this problem I just wanted to poke each sg kdev_t into
the corresponding Scsi_Device. People objected that this was
a layering violation. Kurt has added a new upper level callback
find_kdev() which is cleaner. Based on this new callback we
could add a new mid level ioctl that yielded the principal
(k)dev_t (i.e. sd, st or sr) and the generic one. That would
make life easier for cdrecord and cdparanoia (and sg_utils). 
As for SANE, by looking at /proc/scsi/map it could only analyse 
sg devices that where "printer" or "processor" device types.
