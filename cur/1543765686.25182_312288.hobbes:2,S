+	  Rijndael appears to be consistently a very good performer in
+	  both hardware and software across a wide range of computing 
+	  environments regardless of its use in feedback or non-feedback 
+	  modes. Its key setup time is excellent, and its key agility is 
+	  good. Rijndael's very low memory requirements make it very well 
+	  suited for restricted-space environments, in which it also 
+	  demonstrates excellent performance. Rijndael's operations are 
+	  among the easiest to defend against power and timing attacks.	
+
+	  The AES specifies three key sizes: 128, 192 and 256 bits
