Hi list.
I just noticed this in the 2.6.17-rc3 dmesg:
===
Checking 'hlt' instruction... OK.
SMP alternatives: switching to UP code
Freeing SMP alternatives: 0k freed
ACPI: setting ELCR to 0400 (from 1608)
===
Should I be seeing this "SMP alternatives" thing on a !CONFIG_SMP 
kernel? It does say 0k, but something is apparently being done at 
runtime still. Why?
Rene.
