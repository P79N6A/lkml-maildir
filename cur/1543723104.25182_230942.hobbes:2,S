Not if the MD5 option is properly implemented - i.e. MD5 hash checking
is done AFTER the packet is considered valid in terms of "fitting"
sequence number.

It's a hack, not a solution. A solution works always, not just in
some special cases (and given Cisco's implementation, even there
is a window which is "too wide open").
As this thread is fairly off-topic on lkml, I suggest moving it to
somewhere else... But then again, in the appropriate places, these
discussions have already taken place. :-)
