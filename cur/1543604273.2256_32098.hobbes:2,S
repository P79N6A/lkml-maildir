Hi,
I've uploaded a new version. Pretty much just a kernel update:
- Merge 2.4.11 (me)
- Fix some pci64 patch deviates (me)
- Fix sym53c8xx compile error (Marcus Alanen, others)
- Don't hold io_request_lock on IDE b_end_io callback (me)
Get it here:
*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches/2.4.11/
There's a big version that includes the pci64 patch, and a block-only
(mostly :-) version that requires the pci64 patch.
