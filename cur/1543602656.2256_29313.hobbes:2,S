Subject: PCI resource allocation problem in 2.4.10

I just upgraded from 2.4.9 to 2.4.10, and now I get this problem which I
did not have before (cannot allocate resources, plus the error with the
Quadro2). This is a definite showstopper as it prevents the NVIDIA
(closed-source) kernel module from working properly.
