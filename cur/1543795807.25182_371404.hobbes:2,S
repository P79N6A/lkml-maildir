I doubt gdb is in rc.d scripts.  My wild uninformed guess would be
that some process (maybe xinit?) hit a SEGV and had its own signal
handler installed that tried to call gdb and attach to the crashing
process.  I could imagine something like that being useful for
generating nice userspace stack traces to send to the developers.  I
think I've seen something similar in some builds.
