Subject: why both "__pure" and "__attribute_pure__"?

  is there a reason that compiler-gcc.h defines both:
#define __pure                          __attribute__((pure))
#define __attribute_pure__              __attribute__((pure))
one would think that the shorter form would be preferable to go along
with the other short forms defined in that header file, but a quick
tree scan shows that the longer form is used exclusively (although
still not in what you'd call overwhelming numbers):
$ grep -rw __attribute_pure__ * | wc -l
17
$ grep -rw __pure * | wc -l
1
  is there any reason not to just change those few instances to the
short form?
