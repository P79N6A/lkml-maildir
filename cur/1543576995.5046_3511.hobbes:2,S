I'm seeing a new warning with the 2.4.0-prerelease (could have been
introduced in -pre11 or 12):
EXT2-fs warning: feature flags set on rev 0 fs, running e2fsck is recommended
Well I've run e2fsck (version 1.18) twice, and looked at the options for
tune2fs.
Is there an easy way to change the rev of the fs, without a format and
restore?
