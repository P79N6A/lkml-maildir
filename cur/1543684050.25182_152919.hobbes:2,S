Sorry for a bit OT but - anybody has experience with ASUS I-Panel?
It plugs into SM bus, has several buttons, diodes and LEDs. Some of
buttons are apparently programmable and LED can be used to cycle
through sensor information.
It should be accessible via normal i2c interface but I could not find
any description. Also pressing button when some sensor-aware program
runs gives funny results sometimes :)
TIA
