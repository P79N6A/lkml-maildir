Hi Harald,
Monster screen size -- I don't know a cheap way to fix this.
Moving menus down into subtrees doesn't help because xconfig wants
to flatten the tree and display them all on the top anyways.
Options grayed out -- this is not a bug; this is the way xconfig works.
It doesn't look very good when they are grayed out because they are for
another architecture.  The only cheap way to fix this is to make one
video Config.in for each architecture.
Submenus hoisted to main menu -- again, this is by design.  Probably
not easy to change this design.  xconfig isn't just a program, it's
a compiler that emits another program.
I have no urge to changed any of these things.  I have a strong urge
to learn gtk+ and write a new program from scratch.  Not for 2.2,
though.
