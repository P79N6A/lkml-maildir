Hi,
apart of just struggling whose core is better, I'd like to find 
rationale in both.
I think that we've got to have a final convergence of the cores, so 
let's pass over to constructive dialogue.

Can you please review both the list and the new core and comment on the 
recent one?

True, although it works with 2.6.14 which is probably the most recent 
kernel needed for anyone else aside :-)
Will respin shortly anyway.

Well, I can agree that for simple SPI devices David's core might be 
easier to use.

Those two are fulfilled in both cores.

Lemme point once again that David' core is not DMA-ready. More comments 
on that will follow, lemme get some sleep :)

IMHO this one is fulfilled in both.

Yeah David's core fulfilling this one well. However, my view on that is 
it's leaving too much for the controller driver to implement, requiring 
so much sophistication from it that it partially disapproves the whole 
concept of having the _core_.

Yeah and I do suggest that we start a true convergence of the cores. I 
think that it should happen after David thoroughly reviews/comments 
Dmitry's notes on his core rather than just say in bare words that 
they're invalid.
