From the spec sheets at Intel it looks like the safe range varies a little
between 75 and 78 C depending on the specific Xeon in question.
For example
	
http://www.intel.com/design/xeon/datashts/290740.htm
page 89 lists ranges of 75-78 depending on core freq.
I only found one chip that went above 78C (81C) but didn't delve into 
which it was.
Intel website has crappy navigation, but at least the info is there. :)
