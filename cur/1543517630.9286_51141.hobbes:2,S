You mean 512 byte , right ?
If so why not ?
Because linux doesn't support it ( in which case I am silent )
or because it is impossible ?
In that case I must disagree, it _is_ possible.
Reads should be no problem.
For writes, either accumulate enough softblocks to write a hardblock,
or read the relevant hardblock, update it with the new softblock and
write it back. With some caching there would probably be no noticable
slowdown.
