Here's a new one:
http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/linux/q3a/
I have an AMD CPU and a kernel 2.4.*, Quake III Arena is slowing down to 
a complete stop after a while?
It seems the 3DNow! copy routines have issues with the southbridge chip 
in the KT133A, this results in performances degrading while playing for a 
while. Re-compile your kernel without 3DNow! instructions to avoid the 
problem, and wait for newer kernels with better support for 3DNow! / 
KT133A.
Anyone know further details on this and if it's in any way connected with 
the current K7 optimization problems in the kernel?
