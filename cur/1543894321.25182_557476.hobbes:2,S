With 64k pagesize the amount of memory required to hold a kernel tree (say)
will go from 270MB to 1400MB.   This is not an optimisation.
Several 64k pagesize people have already spent time looking at various
tail-packing schemes to get around this serious problem.  And that's on
_server_ class machines.  Large ones.  I don't think
laptop/desktop/samll-server machines would want to go anywhere near this.

I don't see what fsck has to do with it.
fsck is single-threaded (hence no locking issues) and operates against the
blockdev pagecache and does a _lot_ of small reads (indirect blocks,
especially).  If the memory consumption for each 4k read jumps to 64k, fsck
is likely to slow down due to performing a lot more additional IO and due
to entering page reclaim much earlier.
