The only way to fix all that would be to move the instruction checks early
into the fast path.
[On a P4 the overhead is 3.7268 vs 3.6594 microseconds for a fault that 
doesn't hit as measured by lmbench2's lat_sig. This was before the latest 
changes which added more checking, so the overhead is probably bigger now]
