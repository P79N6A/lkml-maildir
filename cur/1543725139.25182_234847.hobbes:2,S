It's GND+power&data. The device derives its power from transitions on
the data line driven by the master. Consequently there are some fairly
strict timing requirements on those pulses. Some devices can also be
powered by a dedicated VCC line which generally allows the device to
respond faster. A temperature sensor IC, for example, can usually
complete a conversion cycle much faster when it has dedicated power.
