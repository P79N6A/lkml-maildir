All use of automount that I've seen so far has involved mounting the autofs 
'filesystem' on a certain mountpoint (e.g. /homes) and letting automount do the 
submounts for you (e.g. /homes/$USER). I'm not sure offhand if autofs can 
handle just mounting a single device on a top-level mount (e.g. automounting 
the whole of /opt when it's accessed)
