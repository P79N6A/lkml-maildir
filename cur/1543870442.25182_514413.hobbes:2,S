It is intended that glibc use this same syscall for both posix_fallocate()
and posix_fallocate64().
I'd agree with Eric on the "command" flag extension.
That new argument might need to come after "fd" - ARM has funny requirements on
syscall arg padding and layout.

Please always put a blank line between the variable definitions and the
first statement.
Please always use hard tabs, not bunch-of-spaces.  This seems to happening
rather a lot in the ext4 patches.  It's a trivial thing, but also trivial
to fix.  A grep across the diffs is needed.
ENOTTY is a bit unconventional - we often use EINVAL for this sort of
thing.  But EINVAL has other meanings for posix_fallocate() and isn't
really appropriate here anyway.  So I'm not sure what would be better...
