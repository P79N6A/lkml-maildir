Ahh, very neat.  This is a useful tool.
One idea would be to allow users to set CPUs processes _can't_ run on. 
On high-end systems sometimes a CPU is affined to a particular IRQ (say,
network interface).  Another situation is where you bind a RT task to a
given CPU.  In these situations, you want everything else to _not_ run
on the CPUs.  I.e., `run --bind=!1' (note its easy to generate the
bitmask here too, by ANDing the inverse of the given CPU against -1).
At any rate, what is needed most is to standardize on an interface for
these scheduling mechanisms.  I guess its just CPU affinity we have to
go ... since not much progress was made of my (proc-based) method vs.
Ingo's (syscall-based) method, at this point either of the two being
merged would make me happy.

I assume you have no problems with it ... I think I'd like to add the
change that the CPUs reported correspond to the physical CPU number and
not the logical value we derive.  On x86 this won't make a difference,
but its a proper method I suspect.
