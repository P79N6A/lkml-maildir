Well, commenting that out makes the 2d ddx driver not to use the CP, drm
etc.
Almost sounds like a hardware issue to me, very few people have problems 
when only using 2d (dri loaded or not) with the radeon driver (as far as 
I can tell). You could try using pci gart instead of agp, if there's a 
problem with your agp bridge (not sure if that would help though in that 
case), Option "BusType" "PCI" (old xorg versions might not understand 
that option however, they might have a boolean "ForcePCIMode" option 
instead).
