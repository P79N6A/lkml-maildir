correct.

no, it's not a big scalability problem. rwlocks are really a mistake -
if you want scalability and spinlocks/semaphores are not enough then one
should either use per-CPU locks or lockless structures. rwlocks/rwsems
will very unlikely help much.

yes, that complexity to get it perform in a deterministic manner is why
i introduced this (major!) simplification of locking. It turns out that
most of the time the actual use of rwlocks matches this simplified
'owner-recursive exclusive lock' semantics, so we are lucky.
look at what kind of worst-case scenarios there may already be with
multiple spinlocks (blocker.c). With rwlocks that just gets insane.
