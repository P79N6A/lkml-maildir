To trigger the bug you have to have _just_ the right memory usage, I 
suspect. You literally have to have the destination page directory 
allocation unmap the _exact_ source page (which has to be clean) for the 
bug to hit. 
So I suspect the oops only triggers on the machine that the trigger
program was written for.
Your version of the patch saves a goto in the source, but results in an 
extra goto in the generated assembly unless the compiler is clever enough 
to notice the double test for NULL.
Never mind, that's a micro-optimization, and your version is cleaner. 
Let's go with it if Rajesh can verify that it fixes the problem for him.
Rajesh?
