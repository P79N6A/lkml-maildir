Where do I get this only when patching from CVS?

Well ok,.. module is loaded now:
I've set check_pci_parity to 1 everything else is 0 in sysfs...
# sysctl -a | grep mc

But this has nothing to do with edac, has it?
And I've already had diff errors again,..
so if there had been some parity issue it should have been logged, right?
