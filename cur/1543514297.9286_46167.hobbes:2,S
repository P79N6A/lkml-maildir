That's fine too --- the point is that it is up to the filesystem.  If
you want to drop the lock for the duration of the allocation, you are
free to do so.  If you need more locking, you are free to add it.  In
this specific case, there is nothing in the VFS which forces you to
use the superblock lock --- the filesystem's internal locking is
entirely up to you.

That could be done, but so much of the filesystem code relies on the
big lock right now that you'd want to deal with that first ---
registration is a relatively minor issue.
