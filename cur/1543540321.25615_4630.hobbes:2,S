Due to machines that can't program their clocks to the standard clock rate
I've created a patch which does things somewhat different.  I found the
USER_HZ approach to be insufficient, there is a lot of software out there
which uses <linux/param.h>'s HZ definition directly upto and including the
current glibc development snapshot, so you're more or less forced to live
with HZ.
