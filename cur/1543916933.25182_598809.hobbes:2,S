Hello,
I am trying to use kprobes to measure the latency of a function by
instrumenting its call site.  Basically, I find the call instruction,
and insert a kprobe with a pre-handler and post-handler at that point.
The pre-handler measures the latency (reads the TSC counter).  The
post-handler measures the latency again, and subtracts the value that
was read in the pre-handler to compute the total latency of the called
function.
So to measure the latency of foo(), I basically want kprobes to do this:
pre_handler();
foo();
post_handler();
The problem is that the latencies that I am getting are consistently low
(~10,000 cycles).  When I manually instrument the functions, the latency
is about 20,000,000 cycles.  Clearly something is not right here.
Is this a known issue?  Instead of using the post-handler, I can try to
add a kprobe to the following instruction with a pre-handler.  I was
just curious if there was something fundamentally wrong with the
approach I took, or maybe a bug that you should be made aware of.
Please CC me on any replies (not subscribed to LKML).
Thanks,
Avishay
