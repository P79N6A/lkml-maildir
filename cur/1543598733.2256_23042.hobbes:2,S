Don't know about 'modern' distributions, but serial ports are normally
set up only when they are used. `man setserial`. In the 2.x.x kernels,
the IRQs are assigned only when a device is opened. The IRQs are
released when the device is closed.
Why would you care what IRQ is being used for serial I/O? The API doesn't
even know. What do you mean by; "setting my pilot for synchronization"?

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
