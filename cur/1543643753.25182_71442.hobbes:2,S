Correct!
MORONS that think the drive vendors are not clued into the issue.
I have to read and vote on NASTY proposals, whose intent is to check for
G-Force damage.  If you think that record is not findable, even if you

They are loosing money because of returns and are about to have the means
to tell you nice try, does warrenty fraud mean anything?
