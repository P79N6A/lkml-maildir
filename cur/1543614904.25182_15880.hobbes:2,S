What about instead of tracking bugs and if they've been squashed. Why 
don't we build a database of known bugs with different kernel versions. 
i.e. You can go to the site and get a complete list of every single bug 
that people have entered about 2.0.36 you're still running on that box 
under the stairs.
People could then 'vote' on the bug, so we could keep track of what's a 
big problem for a lot of people, and what's something that just one 
person found not to work.
This would also help people pick 'stable' kernels for their own systems.
Kept seperate from kernel development (i.e. bugs never have to be 
'closed') it means that Linus et al wouldn't have to spend half their 
time there (esp if it wasn't the way they wanted to work), unless they 
wanted to of course :)
