That's good to hear!

I use a similar approach (for the 'old style' SBS) in /etc/rc.local:
  /sbin/modprobe -r battery
  /sbin/modprobe -r ac
  /sbin/modprobe i2c-acpi-ec
  /sbin/modprobe acpi-sbs
W.r.t. enabling/disabling ac&battery when sbs is selected: I'm not so
sure if that would be a good idea. You build a kernel with modules,
and at some later stage it is selected which modules will be actually
be used.
