Hi,
I have a 32-bit user land application which sends an IOCTL to a 64-bit 
Kernel module. I have a few different cmd codes that I can send through 
the IOCTL. For some reason I seem to always get the same IOCTL cmd from 
user land, no matter what the ioctl() call is given. This cmd code that 
I get has some bytes (W/R and the module code) that are OK, but the rest 
is just garbage or zeros. This was originally a 32-bit system, and we 
are no converting the Kernel module to 64-bit, so maybe there's 
something special for 32-64 communication that miss.
I am working on Linux Kernel v2.6.18.
Thanks
