By "both alloc function", do you mean the .setup_comp() and .setup_decomp()
functions? If yes, then I understand.
(Yesterday, I thought you meant to have separate alloc functions instead of the
one crypto_alloc_pcomp())

I doubt whether it's a good idea to drop the compatibility soon, as the
underlying LZO library in the kernel doesn't support partial (de)compression,
and needs significant rework to do so.
