  yes, i realize that, but surely there's a cleaner way to implement
something that's supported by only *some* of the architectures rather
than duplicating the code for every one of those architectures.
  one possibility is to have the global config option look like this:
config DEBUG_SEMAPHORE
	bool "Semaphore debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && HAVE_SEMAPHORE_DEBUGGING
				   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        default n
	...
  at that point, any architecture that implements semaphore debugging
and wants to advertise that simply needs to add this at the top of its
Kconfig.debug file:
config HAVE_SEMAPHORE_DEBUGGING
        def_bool y
  that was just off the top of my head, but it seems to work.  more
generally, though, surely this sort of thing has come up before --
wanting to advertise an identical user-configurable option only for
certain architectures.  how is that done *now* without rampant code
duplication?  or is it?
