Following patch fixes it for 2 channel devices (like my notebook). Although I'm
not sure if this is all that useful... if there are workloads other than audio
work that need low latency, then this might be useful.
Without this patch, my machine was generating the latency each time artsd (KDE)
re-opened the audio device.
