The acpi "performance library", whether it uses the CONFIG_ACPI parser or
some small independent parser, is (at least) also useful for
- ACPI 2.0 P-States using I/O-port access [current
  arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/acpi.c driver -- it can be cleaned up by
  that. In fact, I'm currently working on it.]
- speedstep-centrino driver [can use ACPI info instead of built-in tables]
  [sample patch based on earlier acpi-perflib patch is in the cpufreq and
   acpi-devel archives]
