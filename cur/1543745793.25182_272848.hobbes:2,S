Duh, there is one in there :\
Still, that doesn't really say much about a normal tasklist traversal
because this thing will spend ages writing stuff to serial console.
Now I know going over the whole tasklist is crap. Anything O(n) for
things like this is crap. I happen to just get frustrated to see
concessions being made to support more efficient /proc access. I know
you are one of the ones who has to deal with the practical realities
of that though. Sigh. Well try to bear with me... :|
