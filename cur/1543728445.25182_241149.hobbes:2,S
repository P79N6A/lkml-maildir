This is the direction I am coming from.

Great.

Attached is a patch to avoid using shared libraries in the build system. 
It is very simple, instead of [m]conf linked against libkconfig.so, they
directly link against $(libkconfig-objs).
For (g|q)conf they no longer use dl_open and also directly link against 
$(libkconfig-objs). (Achieved by export LKC_DIRECT_LINK to the compile.)
(Give this change one could also get rid of rules to build .so files
in Makefile.lib)
Cheers,
Benno
