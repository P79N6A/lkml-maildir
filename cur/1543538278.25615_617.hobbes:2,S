Patents on software algorithms are illegal in most of europe. The EU also
doesn't give a hoot about the US in general. We ship products to Cuba and
have a standing arrangement which involves slapping 100% tariffs on all US
products if the US tries to hassle us about Cuban product shipments.

Point of correction: Patents do not apply to military use under WIPO.
