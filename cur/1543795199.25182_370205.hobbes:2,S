I think you're being unreasonable.
They've worked on a fix for the problem, and now you're unable to test
the fix, and you're angry at them because they took so long to code up
the fix.
If you're overextended and have too much work to do and that's
stressing you out, that doesn't give you permission to take it
out on other people.
