That is indeed rather odd, and very interesting.

Well, I think that what _would_ be generally correct, and actually pretty 
simple, is a rather different approach: just not sizing things behind a 
transparent bridge AT ALL, since it really shouldn't matter.
So if the appended patch fixes things for you, I think this might 
potentially be the right approach.
NOTE NOTE NOTE! This patch is entirely untested, as usual. I didn't check 
that this is necessarily the correct place to test for this, but it 
does make sense. IOW, it _feels_ like the rigth thing. However, even if it 
fixes things for you, I think we're too late in the 2.6.28 cycle to really 
apply this.
So it really does make sense to consider a root bridge and a transparent 
one to be equivalent here, since in both cases any bridge windows should 
be irrelevant. Which is why I think this patch is interesting.

100% agreed. I do _not_ see why it should ever matter how we set up a PCI 
bridging window - whether prefetchable or not - on a bridge that should be 
transparent. It sounds really odd. I'm wondering if there is something 
we're missing here.
But apart from the existence of the bridging window, the only thing that 
it seems to affect is really just a minor layour issue. So it does seem 
like it matters. Odd.
