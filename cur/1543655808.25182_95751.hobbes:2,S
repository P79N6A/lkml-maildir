Under Linux 2.5.51 Ive noticed that Downloader4X (Getright-type for
linux) 
http://www.krasu.ru/soft/chuchelo/
when trying to resume a file, It thinks the file is still being
accessed, however under 2.4, it has no such problem. Is this a bug in
2.5.x still? any patches available that could help?
thanks
