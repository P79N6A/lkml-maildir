Thats a pretty crappy controller you have in with
that shiny P4...
I'm not sure that they want the tools to work.
They'll just call you a troll and go on
developing unnecessary things like NAPI because
they're still using controllers designed by DEC
(remember them?) back in the stone ages. 
Yet I regularly encounter people using cheap NICs
with expensive cpus on network-intensive
applications. But you'd think one or two people
would have a clue.
