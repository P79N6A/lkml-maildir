That's not the purpose of that API call, sched_clock() measure real time
period.
After reading your emails it sounds like what you really want is similar
to accurate state accounting which is used for scheduling purposes. Part
of that has already been implemented at least twice that I know of.
Accounting real time against specific states was done in two version of
microstate accounting. Those are fine starting points for the changes
you are wanting.
