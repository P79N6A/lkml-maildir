So you fixed the nonexistent race only.  The real race is that the module
structure gets initialized first (so the exception table pointers point to
uninitialized vmalloc'd (module_map'd) memory), then the module data
(including the exception table) gets copied.
The race window is from the first copy_from_user in sys_init_module until
the second one.
Or am I missing something ?
