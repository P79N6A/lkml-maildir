Tested on a 3c509B combo TP/AUI PnP card. Status check didn't kill the link.
Switching to AUI and back to TP worked. Attempt to switch to 100Mbps gave an
error but had no ill effects. Switching to full duplex (talking to a 3c575_cb
over a crossover cable) worked, as did going back to half duplex.
But what's up with the driver date? October 16th is about a week in the future :-)
