Sorry I didn't reply to this thread, after Alan wrote I figured
the topic was closed;-)
Yes, per my initial message, gcc _will_ generate cmpxchg for the 80386
build.  Indeed, it has been doing so for over a year with ACPI's
previous private (and flawed) asm() invocation of cmpxchg.
Andi/Alan suggested we invoke cmpxchg always in ACPI,
but disable ACPI at boot-time in the unlikely event we find
ourselves running on a cpu without that instruction.
Luming has already taking a swing at this patch here:
