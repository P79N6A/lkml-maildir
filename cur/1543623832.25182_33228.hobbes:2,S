Actually, it could boil down to something more:
use-once reduces the VM to FIFO order, which suffers from
belady's anomaly so it doesn't matter much how much memory
you throw at it
drop-behind will suffer the same problem once the readahead
memory is too large to keep in the system, but at least the
already-used pages won't kick out readahead pages
