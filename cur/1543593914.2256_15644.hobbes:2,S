No its not.  For instance the slab caches encompass the inode and dentry
caches.  Point I was/am tring to make is not that this memory is lost or
not need, but that is it _not_ accounted.  ie. There is not way to tell
what is using it, hense we cannot see leaks or places that could be 
optimized.
I have attempted to count all memory I could.  The 123M is what is left in
the kernel overhead bucket...
