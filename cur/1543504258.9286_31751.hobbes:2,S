Nope. Many modern computers use an el. cheapo clock that is just plain
inaccurate, and they don't keep time very well. Any Compaq ProLiant produced
in the last 6 years keeps time to no better than plus or minus one to two
minutes per day. Since these are generally used as servers, its a significant
pain in the posterior - unless you are connected to the Internet, or have
some other way to sync. the time of day to an external source.
In several stand alone systems I have had to use NTP to sync the Compaq
machines to cheap no-name Taiwanese ones that are accurate to a few seconds
per month. Silly, ain't it.
