Don't use uint32_t.  Use u32 instead.

But actually, I don't understand why you don't just pass a msg_address
pointer to msi_target instead.
(last two points apply throughtout this patch)

Yuck.  There's a reason C allows you to call through function pointers as if
they were functions.

Why do it this way instead of having a pointer to a struct?

How about leaving struct msg_data alone and adding
union good_name {
	struct msg_data;
	u32 value;
}
Or possibly struct msg_data should just be deleted and we should use
shift/mask to access the contents of it.  ISTR GCC handled that much
better.
