Hello Rik,
there is a nice little toy called "pmap.c" around for several years, now.
Should we consider?
/*
 * pmap.c: implementation of something like Solaris' /usr/proc/bin/pmap
 * for linux
 *
 * Author: Andy Isaacson <adi@acm.org>
 * Fri Jun 18 1999
 *
 * Updated Mon Oct 25 1999
 *  - calculate total size of shared mappings
 *  - change output format to read "writable/private" rather than "writable"
 *
 * Justification:  the formatting available in /proc/<pid>/maps is less
 * than optimal.  It's hard to figure out the size of a mapping from
 * that information (unless you can do 8-digit hex arithmetic in your
 * head) and it's just generally not friendly.  Hence this utility.
 *
 * I hereby place this work in the public domain.
 *
 * Compile with something along the lines of
 * gcc -O pmap.c -o pmap
 */
Regards,
	Dieter
