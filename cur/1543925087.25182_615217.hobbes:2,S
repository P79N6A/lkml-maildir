Not really a credible difference as the reported difference is between
two *clients* and the speed of getattr vs lookup would depend on the
*server*.

I suspect a more detailed analysis of the traces is in order.  I
strongly suspect you will see a difference between the two clients,
and you have only reported a difference between the first and second
"ls -l" (unless I missed some email).
It seems most likely that 2.6 is issuing substantially more GETATTR
requests than 2.4.  There have certainly been reports of this in the
past and they have been either fixed or justified.
This may be a new situation.  Or it may be that 2.4 was being fast by
being incorrect in some way.  Only an analysis of the logs would tell.
Maybe you would like to post the (binary, using "-s 0") traces for
both 2.4 and 2.6....
