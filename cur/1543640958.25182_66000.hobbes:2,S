Hi all,
I've just ran a few test "dbench" based against:
- 2.4.18
- 2.4.18 + compressed cache -0.24pre3
- 2.4.19
- 2.5.31
Ok, I know that dbench is not a "good" test,
but it should be at least a good stress test.
I got neither oops nor BUG().
Each test has been ran twice.
Here it goes the results:
2.4.18
