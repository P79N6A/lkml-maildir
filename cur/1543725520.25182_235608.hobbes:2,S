Hi,
sorry for the scrumbled reply as i'm not
subscribed to the list.
Mandrake is using devfs as default way to manage
devices ever since it included the 2.4.0-test kernels
and is currently near freeze for the next release 10.1
which will be probably based on 2.6.8 kernel still using
devfs. 
The current state of udev in Mandrake is pretty useless, 
none made attempts to integrate udev as replacement 
of devfs. Yes there is a binary package of udev,
but technically it's as if it's missing. udev
is mostly working, but ....
the entire distro is not aware of it existence
udev is not supported by init scripts, mkinitrd
the distro's tools for configuration
if you really decide to drop devfs so soon,
i guess the only choice for the next Mandrake release
would be to revert the patch or stay with an older kernel
best,
svetljo
