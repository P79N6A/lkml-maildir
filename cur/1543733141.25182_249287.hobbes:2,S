Yes, it doesn't make much sense to pipe the kevents through
/sbin/hotplug, but I definitely want the hotplug-events over netlink,
to get rid of the SEQNUM reorder nightmare and unpredictable delay of
the execution of the /etc/hotplug.d/ helpers, we currently can't handle
very well with HAL.
I expect, that we need to have both transports (for hotplug), cause early
boot is unable to react to netlink messages.
The /sbin/hotplug can easily switched off, after some "advanced event daemon"
is running by: "echo -n "" > /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug".
What about moving the /sbin/hotplug execution from lib/kobject.c to
kernel/kobj_notify.c and merge it with our netlink code? This would
separate the "object-storage" from the "object-notification" which is
nice. And we would have a single place to implement all kind of event
transports.
If anybody invents some other kind of transport it can go into
kobj_notify.c. All transports can share some code and are highly
configurable then.
kernel/kobj_notify.c would export:
        kobject_hotplug(const char *action, struct kobject *kobj)
        kobj_notify    (const char *signal, struct kobject *kobj, struct attribute *attr)
lib/kobject.c just calls kobject_hotplug() and we get the event on both
transports at the same time. All other events just use kobj_notify() which
doesn't do /sbin/hotplug.
How does it sound?
Thanks,
Kay
