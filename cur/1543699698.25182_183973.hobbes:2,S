hello,
i try to use a ibm thinkpad 560e notebook and while booting the kernel
<F9>stoped with this message (a screenshot from this notebook is here: [1])
kernel BUG at page_alloc.c:105!
invalid operand: 0000
CPU:	0
EIP	0010:[<c0128d07>]	Not tainted
EFLAGS:	00010206
eax: 00000000	ebx: c1000a6c	ecx: c1000a6c	edx: 00000000
esi: 00000000	edi: c02af980	ebp: 00002000	esp: c0293f60
...

i have to type this by hand from the notbook, so there may be typing
errors. please have a look at the screenshot for the correct (and
complete) errormessage. the page_alloc line (?) 105 changes sometimes 
from 105 to 103 or 106
please send me an e-mail if you need to know more and i will send you
the information as soon as i can.
maybe anyone withe an idea? thanks,
patrick
