Hi Linus,
Please pull the 'agp-patches' branch from
ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/agp-2.6.git agp-patches
This contains a patch from Arjan to avoid ioremap stupidities in agp, and 
adds a warning to catch any others. It also contains an update for the SiS 
chipset driver.
Dave.

    fix historic ioremap() abuse in AGP
    
    Several AGP drivers right now use ioremap_nocache() on kernel ram in order
    to turn a page of regular memory uncached.
    
    There are two problems with this:
    
        1) This is a total nightmare for the ioremap() implementation to keep
           various mappings of the same page coherent.
    
        2) It's a total nightmare for the AGP code since it adds a ton of
           complexity in terms of keeping track of 2 different pointers to
           the same thing, in terms of error handling etc etc.
    
    This patch fixes this by making the AGP drivers use the new
    set_memory_XX APIs instead.
    
    Note: amd-k7-agp.c is built on Alpha too, and generic.c is built
    on ia64 as well, which do not yet have the set_memory_*() APIs,
    so for them some we have a few ugly #ifdefs - hopefully they'll
    be fixed soon.
