No idea how I managed to break that after test compiling it... :-/
Thanks for catching it :-)
So unless I messed up something again, here's the final patch.
Thanks,
Björn
Fix two races in the timer stats lookup code. One by ensuring that the
initialization of a new entry is finished upon insertion of that entry.
The other by cleaning up the hash table when the entries array is
cleared, so that we don't have any "pre-inserted" entries.
Thanks to Eric Dumazet for reminding me of the memory barriers.
