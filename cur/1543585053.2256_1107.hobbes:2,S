Sorry, this is not related to your problem...
However, I have just put a 8139 based card into my Linux 2.4.2
system. At one stage, these lines were logged:
Mar 15 09:42:56 snoopy kernel: eth0: Abnormal interrupt, status 00000020.
Mar 15 09:43:04 snoopy kernel: eth0: Abnormal interrupt, status 00002020.
Mar 15 10:06:52 snoopy kernel: eth0: Abnormal interrupt, status 00000020.
Mar 15 10:06:58 snoopy kernel: eth0: Abnormal interrupt, status 00002020.
The card seems to be reliable apart from these messages. It could be
that I was playing around with the network cable or something at the
time... However, any messages "Abnormal interrupt" make me slightly
nervous.
Anyway, further information:
Mar 14 16:10:22 snoopy kernel: 8139too Fast Ethernet driver 0.9.13 loaded
Mar 14 16:10:22 snoopy kernel: PCI: Found IRQ 12 for device 00:0a.0

(sorry if this problem has already been reported...)
