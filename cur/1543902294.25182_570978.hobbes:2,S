Daniel you seem to be right, as till now, no one of those solutions
for me worked, I always end up or with a non recognised option or a
small square 640x480 pixels where I see the console. I need to try
still the vbetest thing what Mr. Daplas proposed.
In any case this laptop has an screen of 16:10 aspect ratio and I
belive would be good
to have those modes in the vesafb driver.
