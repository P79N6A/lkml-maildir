Well... lot of changes in drivers/net/natsemi.c between 2.4 and 2.6
Previous versions had a max_interrupt_work = 20;
RX_RING_SIZE is 32 for this NIC
But NAPI standard weight is 64, maybe you should try to lower it ? (so that an 
interrupt dont try to queue/dequeue too many packets at once)
/proc/sys/net/core/dev_weight
/proc/sys/net/core/netdev_budget
