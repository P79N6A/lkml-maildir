Subject: 2.3.11 fixed port filtering on my box

Just wanted to make an observation, in case anyone else is playing with
dev kernels.
I noticed that when I compiled 2.3.10 with port filtering enabled, booting
the kernel resulted in a message on boot (immediately after lilo prompt)
Out of Memory
System Halted
I was going to report this, but wanted to do some more research before
submitting.  However, I downloaded 2.3.11 last night, compiled it with the
same config file, and it boots and works.  in fact, i'm using 2.3.11 right
now.
If anyone is interested in the conditions of my failed 2.3.10 boot, I'd be
happy to provide them.
