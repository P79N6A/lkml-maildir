No.  Who says you are using vmlinux and not bzImage.  What if you booted off
a floppy and don't have it anymore?  What happens if you build several
kernels with the same version but different config options and don't
remember which one you loaded at the lilo prompt (assuming you're using
lilo)?  Even if they were still around, you couldn't tell which one was
booted (the version number would be the same).
