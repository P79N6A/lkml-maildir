Russel's trace indicates that the unlink actually has completed and
has become a negative dentry since the file is labelled '(deleted)'.
That means that the dentry count must have been zero, so that
dentry_iput() was called.
I don't see how dentry_iput() can be called on an open file. In
principle the dentry count should always be >= 1, so unless there is
some place where we're calling d_delete() without get()ing the dentry
first, there should be no path for early inode loss.
Cheers,
