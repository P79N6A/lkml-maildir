While I don't have objection against the implementation in userspace,
what will UnionMount handle about rmdir or rename dir?
Those systemcalls need to test whether the dir is *logically* empty or
not in kernel space, don't they?
And I am afraid that UnionMount has to implement the similar thing, but
it never mean to modify glibc is a bad idea.
