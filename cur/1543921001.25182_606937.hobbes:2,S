Yes, you are right, but stac925x has only one DAC, and thus if it is connected to any line-out, it will be
'Front', but if it is connected to 'headphones' only, then why not to call it 'Headphone'
STAC  9200 has no volumeknob too, but it is handled seperartly
STAC  9202 and 9250 has no volumeknob too, but as I said they have just one DAC again
