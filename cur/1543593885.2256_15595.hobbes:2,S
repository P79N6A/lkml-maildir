I have to say that I have absolutely no idea. I only use little-endian
machines myself (and 99% x86).
Also, which ATI Xv stuff are you talking about? The ATI Rage128 and ATI
Radeon Xv code was at least a few months ago completely separate from the
ATI Rage code (the first two were in X CVS, while the latter only existed
in the gatos version). 
Has the Gatos code (or some other code) maybe been integrated into 4.1.0
now? I haven't followed X CVS for the last months very closely..
