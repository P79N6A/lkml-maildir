True.  Altho' at such a time, I'd probably argue for testing for and
rejecting invalid mode/flag combinations in the respective
functions :-).

OK.  I'm "caving"... :-)  Different views of consistency.  But,
eventually, I hope we can replace the separate mode[, flags] and
nodemask in the 'sb_info with a mempolicy and keep the details of modes,
flags, etc. internal to mempolicy.c.
Looking forward to the respin of the patches...
