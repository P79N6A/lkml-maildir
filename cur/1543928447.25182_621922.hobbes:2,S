Weird, the problem is not reproducible here.
# echo a > allow_restart
-bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
[  437.518024] buf_ptr = 0xffff810005e20000, buf = x
[  437.518027] , count = 2
# echo b > allow_restart
-bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
[  438.972973] buf_ptr = 0xffff81001be6f000, buf = y
[  438.972976] , count = 2
# echo c > allow_restart
-bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument

Which is expected.  On each open, sysfs_buffer is allocated with kzalloc
and the buffer is freed on close, so I don't see how it can happen.
Behavior for multiple write can be considered peculiar in that ppos is
essentially ignored and each write is passed just like brand new write
to ->store method but this too is the expected behavior.

[  765.285484] , count = 2
[  765.314002] buf_ptr = 0xffff81001be4f000, buf = c

Andrew Petterson, can you please build 2.6.24-rc3 from clean source tree
and retry?
