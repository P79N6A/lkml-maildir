We also might want to consider a separate mailing list, if the volume of
mail gets unwieldy, then just post release announcements to LKML.  The
volume is high enough and some of the terminology different enough that
we already had one inadvertent bout of flaming over some unfortunate
miscommunication.  As more people get involved this could get out of
hand.  The cc: lists are getting pretty long, and a lot of the testing
requires posting huge traces.  Think about how many copies of each mail
vger has to deliver...
Anyway, I am fine with continuing on LKML, it would really depend on how
Ingo and especially the people for whom this is all noise feel about it.
