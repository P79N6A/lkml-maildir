linux/module.h has been set up, for a long while now, to support
building statically into the kernel as well as building as a module.
Linux kernel rule #812: ifdefs are ugly.  Strive to make your code
ifdef free by creating includes/defines/inline functions that exist
even when your selected ifdef is undefined.  module.h follows that
rule.
Similarly you can include linux/pci.h even if !CONFIG_PCI.
