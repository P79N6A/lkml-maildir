No, I really just don't care which name gets used because none
of them map properly but I don't see value in adding a new one.
I say _USER is fine. I dislike _TYPE because it implies structure
that isn't there and I dislike _ROLE because someone may want to
implement roles on top of Smack (it wouldn't be hard) and don't
want to start using that term for a specific meaning that might
give 'em fits.

And maybe _ROLE, if you look at it from the right angle.
I don't think that it matters. Create a new _LATEFORDINNER
if that makes y'all feel better. Best of all would be to
stick with _USER and call it done.
Thank you.
