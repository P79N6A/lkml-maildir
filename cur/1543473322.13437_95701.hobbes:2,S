Hi all,
The Linux Kernel Archives Mirror System is getting pretty well
populated with servers, but there are a couple of high-use countries
which aren't covered.
If you are, or have contacts, in the following countries and would be
willing to sponsor a mirror, it would be extremely appreciated (of
course, *any* mirror sites would be extremely appreciated!)
See 
http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/become.html
 for the exact details of
what we're asking for.
* Japan
* Australia (I received a registration for Australia, but the site
  wasn't set up properly; hopefully that can get fixed, but we could
  use two in Australia)
* New Zealand
* Germany (hopefully at least one is in process here)
* South Africa
* Israel
* Finland (believe it or not...)
A great many thanks to all existing and future mirrors!
