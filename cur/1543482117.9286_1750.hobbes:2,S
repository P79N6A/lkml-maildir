Is there an e2fs mailing list?
Anyway, my question is, how to best regenerate a filesystem, that's been
copied off a disk with errors, with dd, with conv=noerror, but without 
conv=sync, fortunately there were only a couple of errors, but how
do I find where they were, to insert the required blocks, in order to 
fsck this?
The blocks seem to be some way from the start of the disk, as some of it
is readable, with debugfs.
