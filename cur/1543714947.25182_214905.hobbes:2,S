I can add my "me-too" here. I own a Dell I8600 which perform excellently
in gentoo with 2.6.x, with the only remaining issue being
suspend+resume.
I have tried several times to understand this ACPI thing, only to find
that the KISS principle has been forgotten when it has been designed.
Maybe it's simply not possible to design something"acceptably simple" in
this business, but the fact that Alan Cox has called it "terminally
broken" tend to support my point of view.
My intend is not to start a flamewar here, but with laptop HW coming
down in price, we have to provide a better support for casual users. 
I can't contribute code here, but I can test things you throw at me for
Dell I8600, so feel free.
