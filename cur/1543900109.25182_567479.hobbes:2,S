Yes, thanks.  It doesn't actually tell us why we want to implement
this attribute and it doesn't tell us what the implications of failing
to do so are, but I guess we can take that on trust from the NFS guys.
But I suspect the ext4 implementation doesn't actually do this.  afaict we
won't update i_version for file overwrites (especially if s_time_gran can
indeed be 1,000,000,000) and of course for MAP_SHARED modifications.  What
would be the implications of this?
And how does the NFS server know that the filesystem implements i_version? 
Will a zero-value of i_version have special significance, telling the
server to not send this attribute, perhaps?
