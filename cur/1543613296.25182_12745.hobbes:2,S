Hi,
In case of unnumbered interfaces of a router( that does not possess a IP
address ), lets assume the interfaces be SONET/SDH interface, how can we
bind a socket to the specific interface. Does linux supports unnumbered
interface concept if so how to bind the socket. Kindly throw some light
on this area.
TIA
Ramesh
