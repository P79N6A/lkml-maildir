Just two comments.
1. IMHO, ata_qc_issue_prot_ledtrigger() without 'with' is good enough. 
This is just my personal preference.  Feel free to ignore it.
2. Patch #1 and #2 should be merged.  They're one logical change of 
adding ata_qc_issue_prot_with_ledtrigger().  Patch #3 is a logically 
separate change of using it, but unless it's a wide conversion, 
implementing something and using something can be merged.  So, please 
merge #1 and #2 and possibly #3.
Thanks.
