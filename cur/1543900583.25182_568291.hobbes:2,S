As far as I can see, none of 64-bit architectures masks the HIGHMEM
(or any other) bits. It's just not obvious because most of their
"alloc_coherent" routines are hidden in iommu_ops or something like that.

According to DMA-mapping.txt GFP_ATOMIC is mandatory for
pci_alloc_consistent() since it can be called from interrupt context.
So sparc code is probably incorrect...
