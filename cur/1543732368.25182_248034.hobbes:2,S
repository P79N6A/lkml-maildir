Hi all...
Since 2.6.8.1-mm3, my system hangs when I modprobe -r ipt_MASQUERADE
(yup, you guessed, its an SMP box). Just locks hard.
A kernel build without module unloading seems to work. I heard about
module unloading not being safe, but this is the first time it hits me
seriously. If it is so dangerous and deprecated, why is still in Kconfig ?
Could you kill it and remove the code completely ? Because I suppose that
the idea is not to fix drivers...
But I guess this is going to break a lot of distros. At least Mandrake
initscripts is plenty of <modprobe, test, rmmod | modprobe -r> snippets.
Do not know if this is going to break cases like
modprobe -r xxxx || do_more
Could modprobe at least return 0 to the shell when removing ?
What is going on ?
TIA
