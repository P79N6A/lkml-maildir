Still some suspicious uses of volatile here.
For example:
> +struct myri10ge_priv {
 ...
> +	volatile u8 __iomem *sram;
as far as I can see this is always used with proper __iomem accessors,
often with casts to strip the volatile anyway.  So why is volatile needed?
I would suggest an audit of all uses of volatile in the driver, since
"volatile" in drivers really should be read "there's probably a bug
here, and if not something very tricky is going on."  If there are any
valid uses of volatile then a comment should explain why, so that
future reviewers don't have to try and puzzle out which of the
two possible translations of volatile is correct.
