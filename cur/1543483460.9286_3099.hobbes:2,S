Ok guys, I looked in my nsswitch.conf, and found nis/nisplus
everywhere.  I do not run NIS, and as such I've removed all
references.  Thanks to everyone who sent a reply.  I don't know
if it worked yet or not because I'm in 2.2 right now.  I do know
that under 2.2 when I untar linux, it is not slow, and it has
UID/GID 1046 or something close...  If I have trouble still I'll
try and resolve it, and post again if necessary.
Thanks all.
