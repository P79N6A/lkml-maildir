Subject: [patch 13/46] ALSA: hda - Dont reset HP pinctl in patch_sigmatel.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

2.6.28-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>
commit 8317e0b0c2234f5f1f5d54804e4093d11bc0dffa upstream.
Resetting HP pinctl at the unplugged state may cause a sort of regression
on some devices because of their wrong pin configuration.
A simple workaround is to disable the pin reset.  This is ugly and may be
not good from the power-saving POV (if any), but damn simple.
