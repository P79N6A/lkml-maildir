Subject: Re: Freezing bug in all kernels greater than 2.4.5-ac13 *AND* 2.4.6-pre2

	I'm currently running 2.4.6-pre8 and happy as a clam, the
problem has been found and reverted, looks from my discussions with
Linus like the page_launder change introduced into pre3 and also
included in ac14 was causing the hangs/near freezes.
	I'm not really much of a coder, so I can't say what was wrong
with it, only what the symptoms were and how to get it to screw up
whenever I wanted to test for it. (See previous messages for how to do
this) If Rik van Riel/Marcelo Tosatti/anyone wants to have me gather
information on what is going on just before/after the kernel dies I'll
do it - just tell me how to, and I'll push it along :)
Thanks a bunch Linus,
Tim
