I think the functions are the right API to use for clients within the
kernel.  The frontend is directed more for userspace clients. 
The old interface was to do an inter_module_get/put, but this is to
be deprecated. And all it does is to provide all the backend functions
to the requestor.
Either  a new interface is provided by agpgart, otherwise, not just intelfb
and i810fb will be affected, but also DRM (which currently uses
inter_module_get/put("drm_agp")).
If I remember correctly, the DRI people also have a new patch that removes
inter_module_get/put and they did it by calling the backend functions directly.
