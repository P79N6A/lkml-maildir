Sorry - I'm not a cryptography expert, just your average Linux hacker :)
I was under the impression that urandom was considered insecure (hence why
it is not used by ssh, FreeS/WAN, etc), and so was very dubious about just
linking /dev/random to /dev/urandom.  However I still had the problem that
being a headless system, there wasn't much entropy (something which had
never been a problem under Cobalt's kernels - presumably they had kludged
/dev/random on the kernel-side).
After various suggestions, and a correction (I now understand urandom to
be secure despite the very theoretical vulnerability), I opted to get
extra entropy from the eepro100 and natsemi network devices.
Anyway, I would consider that the idea of generating entropy purely from
the local console (keyboard / mouse) to be a rather flawed idea - think
how many headless linux servers there are that are running some kind of
cryptographic software.  Maybe a compile-time option in the kernel to
change quality of /dev/random would be an idea so that the person
compiling the kernel can decide on the level of the tradeoff between the
quality and speed/amount of randomness...  Just a thought anyway.
