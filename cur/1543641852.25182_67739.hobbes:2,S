Another data point: My experiences with 2.4.19-pre4-ac2 are remarkably
similar to Mike Isley's, but for a few interesting differences:
- 2.4.18 runs O.K.
- 2.4.19 hangs when checking for partitions
- 2.4.19-ac4 hangs, too
- 2.4.20-pre4 hangs, too
- 2.4.20-pre4-ac2 does not hang, but shows problems exactly as Mike is
  describing:
  - Claims 80pin cable is missing
  - wrong data read from disk, write based on wrong read trashes fs
My hardware:
o Promise PDC20262 On-Board on a GigaByte GA-6BX7+ (Intel 440BX)
o Maxtor 120G (4G120J6)

Does this fix the bogus 80-pin message or does it just have to do with
block addressing and thus the "corruption" issue?
I'm asking because the 20262 seems to break ATAPI devices completely
once it was in a "wrong" mode. I.e. if my PX-W1610 on the second
channel is correctly detected as MDMA2 it works, if it is detected as
something else and I try to tweak it the channel and/or controller
hangs.
Can I somewhere get a complete picture of what is *supposed* to work
with the '62 and what not?
Thanks a lot!
So long,
   Joe
