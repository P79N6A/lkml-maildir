Well the subject does say 'two hosts'. Furthermore, I think that unless
you get refuse for free, a hub and cables and 10/100 cards is cheaper then
thinnet and tees and terms and crap ne2000 cards. The cross cable solution
scales well. (two 10 + hub/cards/cables = many 10. Two 100 + h/c/c = many
10 or with a slightly more expensive hub = many 100.)..
