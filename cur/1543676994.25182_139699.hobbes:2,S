Then maybe you should
a) Read the entire initial thread (which you participated in), esp this 
message:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105518049424749&w=2
b) Read the comments in the code (from drivers/base/sys.c):
/**
 *      sysdev_shutdown - Shut down all system devices.
 *
 *      Loop over each class of system devices, and the devices in each
 *      of those classes. For each device, we call the shutdown method for
 *      each driver registered for the device - the globals, the auxillaries,
 *      and the class driver. 
 *
 *      Note: The list is iterated in reverse order, so that we shut down
 *      child devices before we shut down thier parents. The list ordering
 *      is guaranteed by virtue of the fact that child devices are registered
 *      after their parents. 
 */
c) Try using the code and stop being a troll.
Thanks,
