I get exactly the same message from my kernel. They are routing advice
packets being received by the kernel. Probably you have some sort of
router on the network that is sending out RIP packets for dynamic links.
This would mean that 130.151.17.163 is not a permentant route and the
router is notifying other routers on the network that it is dropping the 
route (i.e. 130.151.17.163 has gone off-line). 
I don't think that they are harmful to your set-up. If your linux box is
not set-up to do routing it will just ignore them.
Hope this helps a bit.
