Why not? Remember the discussion we had a while ago. You can bring the
pages into a state where minimal manipulations are required for alloc free
and avoid all the checks in the hot paths. The SLUB method could be used
taking a big contiguous chunk and then issueing page size portions of it.
That could be quite fast.
Or if you prefer order-0. Do a single linked list like SLQB does.
