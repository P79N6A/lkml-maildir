You don't seem to be reading Keith's message.
The point of merging is that Keith needs time to fix the 
performance problem.  Plus, additional testing would probably 
be helpful.

No, it's known to be slow in some circumstances.

Uh, many drivers cannot be built in the current 2.5 tree.  
Temporary brokenness is acceptable in the development tree.  
It is meant to be _unstable_.  I recall periods when the 
2.3 kernel was corrupting data for many users.  This period
lasted about a week, IIRC.  The kbuild 2.5 system will slow 
people down, but not hose their development system installations.
I personally think two weeks of working at a slower pace is 
an acceptable trade-off for the longterm benefits that Keith
has mentioned.  It seems odd that several people in this
discussion seem to have ignored the repeated statements that
Keith will have little time for dealing with the performance
rewrite until the multiple kernel tree synchronization 
time sink goes away.  Telling Keith that he needs to go on
spinning his wheels while he cannot find time to deal with
the problem you are asking him to fix seems sort of unhelpful.
Perhaps you'd be willing to assist him in the rewrite?
