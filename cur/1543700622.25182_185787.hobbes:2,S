The fix for me was to disable all "Power Management" in the kernel and
re-compile it. Works like a charm now :)
Hope this can help anyone else with the same problem as me. But again, I
think someone should take a look at it cos I think this is a bug for sure.

Not sure what else to try. I see that you've already posted to the ata-raid
list, so I'd hope that somebody else would reply from there. The pdcraid
driver has not received much attention lately, so it may very well be broken
for your configuration. Promise has released a binary/source combo driver
similar to Nvidia's that will still work in 2.4 - you might give that a try.
I have a
PDC20276 based onboard raid setup, however, I use 2.6 with device mapper to
use it. It's a bit of a pain to setup ATM - especially if you want to boot
from it, but it can be done. Good luck,
-Walt
