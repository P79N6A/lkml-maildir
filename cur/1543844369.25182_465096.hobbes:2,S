Robert's stack traces looked completely wrong as well which is why I gave up.
Symbols showing up in this stack traces should have been completely compiled
out.
Also, triggering a panic() at the beginning of the rt mutex acquire was
very useful since it made "in_atomic()" violations an explicit error stopping
the machine. Stack traces started to get really crazy in this preemptive
kernel with all sorts of things running unlike the non-preemptive kernel and
it was time consuming to figure out the real stuff from the noise in the
stack trace.
It made the stack traces smaller and more immediately local to the problem
logic. Then I discovered panic() didn't work correctly in -rt so I fixed that
as well. There were a lot of little breakdowns in 2.6.17-rt...
