hi
i seem to be having some trouble with a new system we just got in.  its
a SuperMicro 370DL3 with dual pIII 733's, 133mhz fsb, 256M ram, AIC-7892
on board.  for some reason, when init goes to runlevel 6, it goes
through all the motions of unmounting/remounting, syncing, stopping
raid, etc...but then locks up (keyboard LEDs and all) right before
actually rebooting the system.  i have two builds of 2.2.17, one with
and one without SMP, and they both exhibit this behavior.  im wondering
if this is a known problem with this board or family of boards or if i
need to start with a stripped down kernel to try to narrow down the
trouble's origin?
any insight would be appreciated,
--james
