argh.. lets try this again..
I've got a wusb v2.1 wireless connection device, which I'm trying to use
with linux 2.4.20-4GB (standard suse linux 8.2), and have been getting the
following errors inside of dmesg:
----
hub.c: new USB device 00:02.0-2, assigned address 3

usb.c: registered new driver usbdfu

at76c503.c: using net device eth0
at76c503.c: using BSSID 02:00:ce:1c:07:00
eth0: no IPv6 routers present
---
It looks like eth0 exists with the right MAC address, but when I
try running dhcpcd on eth0 it basically hangs the dhcpcd call, and when I
try to plug in the linksys unit into the usb slot with KDE
running, KDE hangs..
This is very annoying. I'm not sure what's causing the get_op_mode call to
fail, nor what's causing the usbdevfs call to fail.
Any help would be appreciated - let me know what diagnostic info people
would need in order to file a fixable bug report, too..
Thanks,
Ed
Thanks much,
Ed
