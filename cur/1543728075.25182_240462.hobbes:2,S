burnfree causes a few broken pits/lands on the CD-R so it is best
avoided if the hardware can do it. That you don't see these is a matter
of the reading drive not exporting such information and EFM and CIRC
usually correcting them, but it's still lower quality than a burn
process that hadn't needed burnfree at all.
