so ... did you change your position from accusing us of not giving you 
_any_ credit:
   "It's also interesting how you do that without giving me
    any credit for it."
to accusing us of not giving you _enough_ credit? Did i get that right?
And ontop of that, you now want the credit for providing the basic idea 
for half of the ktimer/hrtimer implementation? Sorry that i did not find 
out in advance that you wanted _that_ ;-)
