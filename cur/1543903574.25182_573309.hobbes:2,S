That wasn't what I said. 
You want to supporess the CVS keyword expansion.
I'm telling you that you should just do so.
But I'm *also* telling you that this has nothing to do with "git diff".
The way to get "git diff" to not show the CVS expansion is to *remove* the 
CVS expansion. By simply running some pre-processing on the patches 
*before* you put them into git in the first place (or, like Dscho 
suggested: you could do it later too, by using git filter-branch).
Once you have the version that doesn't have the CVS log, "git diff" will 
automatically do the rigth thing.
In other words, I'm just saying that you're trying to solve the wrong 
problem. Once you solve the *right* problem, the wrong problem just goes 
away.
