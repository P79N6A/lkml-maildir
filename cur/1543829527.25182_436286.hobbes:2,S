Next time attach a patch fixing, or at least bother to investigate the problem 
which you're so rudely flaming about. Maybe Linux is broken. Nobody said it 
wasn't. But you're closer to (and clearly care more about) the problem than 
99% of the people reading your email.
So why don't you help fix it, instead of laying into Erik and the netdev 
people (who incidentally aren't CC'ed)?
