Ok, that definitely should work.
Does the patch below help?

This is wrong. It's wrong for two reasons:
 - it really shouldn't be needed. I don't think "time()" has to be 
   *exactly* in sync, but I don't think it can be off by a third of a 
   second or whatever (as the "30% CPU load" would seem to imply)
 - gettimeofday works on a timeval, pthread_cond_timedwait() works on a 
   timespec.
So if it actually makes a difference, it makes a difference for the 
*wrong* reason: the time is still totally nonsensical in the tv_nsec field 
(because it actually got filled in with msecs!), but now the tv_sec field 
is in sync, so it hides the bug.
Anyway, hopefully the patch below might help. But we probably should make 
this whole thing a much more generic routine (ie we have our internal 
"getnstimeofday()" that still is missing the second-overflow logic, and 
that is quite possibly the one that triggers the "30% off" behaviour).
Ingo, I'd suggest:
 - ger rid of "timespec_add_ns()", or at least make it return a return 
   value for when it overflows.
 - make all the people who overflow into tv_sec call a "fix_up_seconds()" 
   thing that does the xtime overflow handling.
