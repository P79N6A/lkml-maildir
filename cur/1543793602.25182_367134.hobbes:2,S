Subject: [PATCH 0/5] SPU file system for 2.6.15-rc-mm
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'd like to have the SPU file system included in the -mm kernel
to get broader review and eventually have it merged in 2.6.16.
This version now puts all the spufs files under
arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spufs instead of fs/spufs, since it
is really specific to that platform.
The interface has now stabilized on a set of files per logical
SPU that can be accessed with read/write and sometime poll
or mmap but not ioctl as well as two new system calls, spu_run
and spu_create.
As discussed, the system call numbers that I am using here
conflict with those from the perfmon patches, so I'm moving
the perfmon syscall range to start at 280. This means that
the first patch gets to be applied on top of
perfmon2-reserve-system-calls-reserve-spu-slots.patch.
