Well, in that case, you may find that there _IS_ prior art. The
triggers for the LHC at CERN are PCI boards running to linux (or
solaris) machines.  I seem to be involved in projects to take the data
off at about 13GB/s (as far as I recall the back of envelope).  The
first ring is about 1000 machines in the current design, I believe.

The CERN stuff gets about 6000 particle traces per collision. Each
particle marks several detectors in a sandwich, and the raw data (lots
of bytes per sandwich layer) is taken off and the trajectories and
timings for each trace are computed. Essentially "digital Xray
detection". I forget what the collision rate is at the target. High
enough that the events aliase.

I've news for you .. the passengers were already slowed down by the
visual Xray inspection as they came in, and as there are on average one
piece of hold baggage  per passenger, the bottleneck is at passenger
entry to the airport!

But it seems to be the bottleneck. I imagine most airports have about 4
carry-on scanners, and each passenger takes 60s to go through, so you
cannot have an overall _average_ flow of more than about 4 pieces of
_hold_ baggage per minute to deal with.
Granted, the peaks might be higher, as they are bottlenecked by the
checkin desks. There may be about 100 of those, and each passenger
probably takes 3mins at them, so the flow can peak at about 33 hold
bags per minute (at 1pc/passenger). But there must be long intervals
of low activity because of the average flow calculation.

I see.
