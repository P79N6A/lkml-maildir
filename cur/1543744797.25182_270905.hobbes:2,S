Take zone->all_unreclaimable into account when you move oom_kill in page_alloc.c, 
which I now think might be the simpler fix.
shrink_caches() will fail early due to all_unreclaimable() logic (it wont 
scan/writeout at lower priorities):
	if (zone->all_unreclaimable && sc->priority != DEF_PRIORITY)
		continue;       /* Let kswapd poll it */
I disabled all_unreclaimable after 5 seconds allowed kswapd to scan
the full zone and reliably detect OOM in my kill-from-kswapd patch - 
you might want something similar.
That seems one the main reasons for the spurious OOM kills.
Anxious to see your patch!
