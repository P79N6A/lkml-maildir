The stack seems to be where it should be and seems to stay pretty much
in the same place as it should.  Adding checks for the heap also seem to
stay within bounds.  I've tried making the stack and the heap 64k to no
effect.
Moving the kernel to other places in memory seems to kill the decode
completely during gunzip() which may be a hint I am not sure.
This thing is trying to ruin my mind.
