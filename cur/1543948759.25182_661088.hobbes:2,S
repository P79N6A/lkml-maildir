I don't know much about pci passthrough thing, but in a nutshell it
looks like you just want a way to reserve memory in host which is not
used by host and then also reserve a virtual range in host where you
can create another set of mapping for that reserved memory?
Can't you just provide a command line parameter to reserve a section
of memory, the way crashkernel=X@Y parameter does?

What prevents you from doing this for RELOCATABLE kernels?

Why are you changing this? What is __PHYSICAL_OFFSET? Are you expanding
the kernel text/data region so that you can additionally map this
reserved area? 
If yes, I think probably we should have a separate area altoghether to
map this reserved area than expanding existing kernel text/data region.
Thanks
