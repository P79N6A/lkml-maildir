Hi,
I am using linux 2.6.10 (with Ingo Molnars real time patches) on my mips board.
When I try running high network traffic (10% traffic on a 100Mbps
link) on my target board with the CONFIG_PREEMPT_DESKTOP=y and
CONFIG_PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS=y options enabled I notice that the console
freezes and recovers only after the traffic stops. I do not notice
this behaviour with the CONFIG_PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS option disabled.
I understand that the CONFIG_PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS option puts all softirq
processing to the ksoftirqd daemon, but i do not see why this should
stall the console. I believe there should be some task which is
starving for CPU, but I do not know which one.
The console is on an 16550 serial port.
Could someone please give me some pointers on where I should start looking?
Thanks,
Vinod K.
