Last I checked, the architecture-specific page fault handlers.  They do
something like:
	if (in_atomic())
		goto do_not_service_fault;
This let us implement the atomic copy_*_user() functions.
kmap_atomic() needs to mark the system atomic, so the in_atomic() will
fail.
This was done around ~2.5.30 by akpm.
