ok, how about the attached smp-2.3.41-A1 patch:
	- fixes dumb cr4 flushing typo found by Manfred
	- (tries to fix) current->active_mm == NULL problem by moving the
	  setting of prev->active_mm to after the switch_to(). It happens
	  before has_cpu is set to 0, so it should be safe. It also cannot
	  open up a window to TLB corruption i believe.
