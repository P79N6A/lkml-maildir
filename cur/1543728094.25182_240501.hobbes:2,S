Well, but according to this argument using anything else than iso-8859-1
is just wrong. Strange. :-)

I think that it is very reasonable to expect that a program honors the locale
settings or uses only ASCII characters.
(In this matter, I share your feelings, because I also have non-ASCII
characters in my name, but if I decide to print my name in its full
glory, I respect the locales and don't assume that all the world uses
iso-8859-2 as I do.)
				Have a nice fortnight
