Here's the data from i8042 of, in order, Fn-F1, Fn-F3, Fn-F7, Fn-F8, Fn-Up,
Fn-Down, and Fn-Left:
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: e0 <- i8042 (interrupt, 0, 1) [2277118]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 0a <- i8042 (interrupt, 0, 1) [2277118]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: e0 <- i8042 (interrupt, 0, 1) [2277643]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 07 <- i8042 (interrupt, 0, 1) [2277643]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: e0 <- i8042 (interrupt, 0, 1) [2277987]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 0f <- i8042 (interrupt, 0, 1) [2277988]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: e0 <- i8042 (interrupt, 0, 1) [2278175]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 0b <- i8042 (interrupt, 0, 1) [2278175]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: e0 <- i8042 (interrupt, 0, 1) [2279806]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 06 <- i8042 (interrupt, 0, 1) [2279806]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: e0 <- i8042 (interrupt, 0, 1) [2279940]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 05 <- i8042 (interrupt, 0, 1) [2279940]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: e0 <- i8042 (interrupt, 0, 1) [2280101]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 13 <- i8042 (interrupt, 0, 1) [2280102]
As you can see, no release events :).
There's also Fn-End, Fn-PgUp, Fn-PgDown (all audio related) and the wireless
switch at the side, those do generate release events. Also, the Fn
combinations for num lock, scroll lock, sysrq and pause/break seem to act
normal. There's also Fn-Esc, but that's an ACPI key.
Hope this helps.
Greetings,
Giel
