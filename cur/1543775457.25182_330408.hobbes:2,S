Somewhat flawed analogy, though.  After the protocol definition, the 
browser proper will take any URL that the protocol handler likes, which 
is why file:// works.  After the domain, the http/https handler will 
take any URL at all, except for maybe some character set issues.  So 
assuming the server is compatible with itself, we don't have to worry 
about whether the browser supports going to a directory and having it 
behave as a file (index.html behavior), or going to a file and having it 
behave as a directory (as some scripts do -- I've seen urls that look 
like 
http://example.com/foo.cgi/bar.html
)
Among protocols that behave more like filesystems, such as FTP, you 
can't really pull the same tricks.  When an FTP client asks for a 
directory, it's probably asking for a directory listing, and would be 
quite surprised to find a file there -- or the user would when binary 
data floods their terminal.
I *think* this is how FTP works, but I haven't used it in years, except 
through a web browser.  I still get the feeling that even a web browser 
expects an FTP file to behave as a file and an FTP directory to behave 
as a directory.
But I'm also pretty sure that FTP would be much more receptive to 
file-as-directory than your average sysadmin would.  For one, breaking 
tar is unforgivable, and the only ways I can think of fixing that issue 
are shaky at best when you consider how many apps might do things 
oh-so-slightly different than tar.
