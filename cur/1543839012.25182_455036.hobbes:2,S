No, I still do not understand how this is supposed to work.

So you split processes to three classes (why three?), and
automagically move them between classes based on some rules? (What
rules?)
Like if I'm UNTRUSTED process, I may not read ~/.ssh/private_key? So
files get this kind of labels, too? And it is "mozilla starts as a
USER, but when it accesses first web page it becomes UNTRUSTED"?
