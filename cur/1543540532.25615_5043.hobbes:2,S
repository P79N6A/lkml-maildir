<sigh>
Linus, distributions need loopback to build boot filesystem images. Shipping
2.4 without the loopback device isn't really an option, unless you want
distributions to ship an old kernel version just so that they can make their
boot floppies.
Fix it. Reimplement it from scratch if needs be. But don't remove useful
features from Linux just to get 2.4 out sooner.
