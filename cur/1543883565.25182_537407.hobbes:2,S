GFP_ATOMIC implies that the memory comes from the zones which GFP_KERNEL
also uses.  So the above usage of GFP_KERNEL is redundant and should be
removed.
The way to understand this is to look at the definitions:
#define GFP_ATOMIC	(__GFP_HIGH)
#define GFP_NOIO	(__GFP_WAIT)
#define GFP_NOFS	(__GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO)
#define GFP_KERNEL	(__GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO | __GFP_FS)
#define GFP_USER	(__GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO | __GFP_FS | __GFP_HARDWALL)
#define GFP_HIGHUSER	(__GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO | __GFP_FS | __GFP_HARDWALL | \
			 __GFP_HIGHMEM)
GFP_KERNEL: can sleep, can do IO, can enter filesystems
GFP_ATOMIC: cannot sleep, cannot do IO, cannot enter filesystems
Neither of them contains __GFP_DMA or __GFP_HIGHMEM, so both of them refer
to ZONE_NORMAL and any lower zones (ie: ZONE_DMA)
