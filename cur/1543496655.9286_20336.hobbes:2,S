The reason I said "there have also been claims" is because it's true:
Such claims HAVE been made, so I would be lying if I said otherwise.
The ONLY case I have come across of a utility with anything resembling
such a problem is mkisofs, which is considerably slower when creating
the image in a 2.1G partition than when creating the same image in a
1.9G partition, so is definately susceptible to partition size. Since
it doesn't actually scramble the partition involved, it doesn't fully
fit the claims that have been made, hence my very careful wording in
replying to that question.

That's good to hear.

Like I said, the ONLY flaw that I have come across is the above one in
mkisofs. Perhaps you would like to confirm that the correct author
details for it are as follows:
 Q> Eric Youngdale <ericy@gnu.ai.mit.edu> or <eric@andante.jic.com>
 Q> wrote both the Linux isofs9660 filesystem and the mkisofs
 Q> utility, and is currently main- taining them. The copyright
 Q> for the mkisofs utility is held by Yggdrasil Computing,
 Q> Incorporated.
If that is still correct, then I reported that to the documented
author thereof when I first came across it, over a year ago now, and
as far as I'm aware, it's never been fixed.
Best wishes from Riley.
