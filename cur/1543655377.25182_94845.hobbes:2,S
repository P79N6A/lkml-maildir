Subject: [PATCH] Add support for Epson 785EPX Storage device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Epson 785EPX USB printer has a PCMCIA slot that works as a USB storage
device. usb-storage driver fails to recognize this device since it
returns 0xff for Subclass. Attached patch adds support for the PCMCIA
slot to usb-storage driver.
Marcelo, please apply.
