	Having more than one major for disks is a hack.  Already.

	We've already got systems with 4000 disks attached.  Registered
with the system, even.  This isn't hiding behind some big array.  They
are part of the system.  No, it's not on Linux, because Linux can't
handle it.  But if the system wants to go Linux, Linux has to handle it.
And 1900 disks wont' cut it *today*.  Never mind 2 years from now.
