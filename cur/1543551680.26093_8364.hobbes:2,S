As the USB Mass Storage driver maintainer, I'd like to ask you to mark the
USB Mass Storage driver as EXPERIMENTAL for the 2.2.x kernel series.
This is an unsupported, known buggy backport.  It's prone to OOPSing and
lockups.  Unfortunatly, I don't have time to fix all of these problems --
the original design assumed the presence of the new SCSI error-handling
code, and without that, workarounds will be difficult.

P.S. I apologize if this driver is allready marked EXPERIMENTAL for 2.2.x
-- but I don't have the disk space right now to check, and I wanted to make
sure that, as the maintainer, my official opinion on the matter was voiced.
