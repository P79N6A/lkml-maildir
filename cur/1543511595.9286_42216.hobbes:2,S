I have found myself hitting the 100 device limit with
insmod -o dummyX dummy
when X > 100.  Upon some looking it appears that this limit is set in
/usr/src/linux/net/core/dev.c in the function dev_alloc_name().  My
initial thought was to just double the 100.  However, the "If you need
over 100 please also fix the algorithm..." looks like a bit of a
warning and before I changed this I wanted to know if doing so should
break anything.  Obviously, I will test it before putting it into
production, but wince it is set to 100 I didn't know if this was an
arbitrary limit or if there was a reason for it being 100.
Thanks,
Michael
