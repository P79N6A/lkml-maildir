No. vesafb does not work together with mga driver in X (although
I believe that vesafb works with XFree mga driver, only Matrox driver
is binary bad citizen).

Neither. X restore R/W registers to their previous values, while write-only
registers to their values for normal text mode. Yes, there is a 
'workaround'. Use (much faster) matroxfb.
