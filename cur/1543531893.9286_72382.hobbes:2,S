Because you would need extra synchronization.  How else can the
creater be sure the SIGCONT arrives when the new thread already sent
the SIGSTOP?  This would make the startup process yet slower and we
were just talking about the already high overhead.  This is a two-line
change, nothing which bloats up the kernel or makes it slow.
