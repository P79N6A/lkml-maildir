      char *       a = "a"; // pointer and content can be changed
const char *       b = "b"; // the thing pointed to is const
      char * const c = "c"; // the pointer is const
const char * const d = "d"; // pointer and content can't be changed
void foo(void) {
        *a = 'A';
        a++;
        *b = 'B'; // error: assignment of read-only location
        b++;
        *c = 'C';
        c++;      // error: increment  of read-only variable 'c'
        *d = 'D'; // error: assignment of read-only location
        d++;      // error: increment  of read-only variable 'd'

$ cat [ab].c
const char *a = "a";
const char b[] = "b";
$ gcc -c [ab].c
$ size [ab].o
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
      2       4       0       6       6 a.o
      2       0       0       2       2 b.o
'a' has two entries: one for the named read-writeable pointer, and one for the
    anonymous read-only string, the pointer points to.
'b' has a single entry: just the named read-only string.
