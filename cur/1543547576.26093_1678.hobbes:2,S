Hi Arnaldo,
That is a very decent list you have got there. How about to add to
it:
 - go through all filesystems and convert them from using
mark_buffer_dirty(bh, [0,1]) to just mark_buffer_dirty(bh) since the flag
is now ignored and all buffers are flushed at equal intervals. Also,
change the exported interface, of course.
Conceptually simple, but a lot (at least 3 hours) of work.
Regards,
Tigran
