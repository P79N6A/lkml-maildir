This is the intended method of operation, and we have so far. The PCI bus 
is a child of the root; a USB bus is a child of the rest. 
Legacy is emulation is interesting, since many legacy devices just 
"appear" on the system bus. The method I have suggested for this to create 
a 'legacy bus' that parents all legacy devices found in the system.

The other methods can be wrapped into userspace utilities, if one so 
desires. Some of them already are. There are 'lspci' and 'lsusb' 
utilities.
A device typically knows what device class it belongs to, though this 
information is not represented in struct device currently. If it was, one 
could theoretically do 'lsvideo' (or 'lsdev -c video') to see what video 
devices they had in their system. :)
