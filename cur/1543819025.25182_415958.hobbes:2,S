What I had in mind is an interface that given a PCI bridge will tell
you what's the most restrictive DMA mask for a device on that bridge,
so that you'll know whether you need to enable the IOMMU for that
bridge. I'll even settle for a function that tells you what's the most
restrictive DMA mask in the system, preiod. There's nothing inherently
arch specific about this.
(and as a side note, the IOMMU we are working on on x86-64 is Calgary,
which is actually roughly the same chipset used in some PPC
machines...)
Cheers,
Muli
