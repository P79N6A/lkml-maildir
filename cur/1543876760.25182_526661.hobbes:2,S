I think I should post the updated version what I have soon. It handles
the "container/task group being deleted" case well, by setting
task/ns_proxy->count = 0. The only problem I need to resolve is
notify_on_release support (and also I haven't looked at the resource conters
patches yet).

I think these are fixed in the latest version I have. Will send out to
you later this week (as soon as I drag myself off a higher prio task!).
