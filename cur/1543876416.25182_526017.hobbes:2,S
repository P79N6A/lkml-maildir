Do it like Linus Torvalds and Marissa Mayer and get a better mailer :-D

+config I_KNOW_WHAT_THE_HELL_I_AM_DOING
Let's just hope kconfig does not bust the stack.
Perhaps we could shorten that: I_KNOW_WTF_I_AM_DOING
+	bool "Prompt for config options which will break your computer"
s/will break (.*)/could break $1 if done wrong/;
+	---help---
+	  Some kernel developers sometimes need to tune kernel parameters
+	  outside of their normal limits.  Without complete knowledge of
+	  exactly what you are doing you are likely to corrupt the laws of
+	  physics and destroy the universe (well, not quite, but you'll
+	  certainly corrupt your data and crash your box).  If you really
+	  know what you're doing and accept that if it breaks you get to
+	  keep the pieces, then go ahead and enable this option.
+	  
+	  NOTICE:  Bug reports where this option is turned on in the kernel
+	  config will be: (not necessarily in this order)
+	    1)  Laughed at hysterically
+	    2)  Made much fun of
+	    3)  Ridiculed until we're red in the face
+	    4)  Ignored
+	  
+	  WARNING:  If you are building a kernel for a distribution, DO NOT
+	  TURN THIS OPTION ON!!!  Instead you should submit a patch which

+config EXPERT

 config BROKEN
 	bool
Given that, I hope the number of options dependent on CONFIG_EXPERT will 
outnumber those depending on CONFIG_I_KNOW_WTF_I_AM_DOING.
If you want my answer: not-so-ACK, move the text to CONFIG_EXPERT and 
let's stay sane for the next 366 days until next April 01.
