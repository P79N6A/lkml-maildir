Subject: [PATCH 0/15] KVM userspace interface updates
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This patchset updates the kvm userspace interface to what I hope will
be the long-term stable interface.  Provisions are included for extending
the interface later.  The patches address performance and cleanliness
concerns.
One patch is missing -- I'd like the string pio transfers not to include
guest virtual addresses.  To date all my attempts to write the patch ended
with me losing consiousness.  Hopefully I'll manage it soon.
I'd like to submit the patchset post 2.6.21.  Comments are welcome.
