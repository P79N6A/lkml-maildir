I'm talking about all apps under the traditional 4-clause
BSD license. Every single one of them is incompatible with
a GPL libc. An LGPL library works fine.
BTW, the LGPL isn't just for libraries anymore. It's now the
called the "Lesser" GPL, perfectly suited for apps as well
as libraries. I know this must be what RMS had in mind, so I
released all my "ps" source code under the LGPL. :-)

NIS can be used to specify what filesystem to use.
SMB could be that filesystem.

Sure you can. As long as the kernel loader is happy, no problem.
People commit worse sins trying to squeeze stuff onto a floppy.
