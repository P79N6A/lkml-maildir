No, the problem is that the tool you're compiling is using kernel
headers which it shouldn't use at all.  Please use the headers from
e2fslibs-dev in /usr/include/esxt2fs/ instead.  And yes, they provide
ext3 defintions despite the ext2 name.
The only kernel todo here is to remove ext3*.h from the list of exported
headers ASAP.
