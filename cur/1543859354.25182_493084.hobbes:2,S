As far as I can tell, powersaved still uses these.. I'm not quite sure 
how you can fix it without just removing the functionality from it...

In the common case, it works perfectly well for the management of 
individual PCI devices. Yes it's "wrong", in much the same way as (say) 
the IDE bus registration/unregistration code. But we keep that around 
because despite it being even more broken than devices/.../power/state, 
people are still actually using it and we haven't provided any sort of 
alternative.
Seriously. How many pieces of userspace-visible functionality have 
recently been removed without there being any sort of alternative?
