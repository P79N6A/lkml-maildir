Correct, -rt can't allocate -anything- when preemption if off. That is
the cost for having the allocators itself preemptable.
Even radix_tree_preload() will not work as its functionality was based
on preempt disable to limit access to a global (per cpu) object reserve.
But maybe something similar could be done with a local reserve by using
struct radix_tree_context to pass it along.
I'll see if I can come up with anything like that, that is, if that
would suffice?
