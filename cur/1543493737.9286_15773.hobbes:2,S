No I can't.
But I think that fput() should handle that situation without 
crashing.
I figured out some more details:
sys_lseek():
 * calls fget()
 * ...
 * calls fput()
 * fput() notices file->f_count==0!
   otherwise it would not call locks_remove_flock().
This means there must be an bad entry in 
files->fd[].
get_unused_fd() [in fs/open.c] contains a sanity check for
that case. Do you know why that check was added?
