I'm betting that this is the exact same problem we recently debugged
for someone else here:  there's a Marvell PATA->SATA bridge chip between
that CF card and the SATA controller, and it only works with PIO modes.
Tejun.. perhaps (for debugging) a simple patch to disallow DMA completely,
just to see if PIO works?
Cheers
