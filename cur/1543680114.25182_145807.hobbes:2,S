That is the main drawback all right but it could be addressed by having a
CAP_SYS_USERNICE capability which allows a user to renice only their own
processes to a highest priority of -5, or some other reasonable value
that wouldn't interfere with root processes. This capability would only be
for applications like music players which need to give hints to the
scheduler.
This would make it a bit Linux specific but as the pam module (currently
vapour I know) is the only piece of code that would be aware of the
distinction, it should not be much of a problem.
