Why not have those users use a RTLinux enabled kernel? A softmodem driver
would be easy to do. Certainly a lot easier than maintaining a fully
preemptible kernel. I can see doing a major redesign to make Oracle work
or to make gcc run fast, but  to leap into the pit that has doomed so many
OS's before in order to make it slightly more convenient to run a winmodem?

People who try to do hard RT on NT tell me that the screen saver can kill
latencies.
