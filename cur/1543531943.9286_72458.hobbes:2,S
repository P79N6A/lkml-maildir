Hai ,
            I have some doubts .
                Linux kernel support per user limit . I found the
CHILD_MAX and  lot such variables defined even getrlimit method return
me the the value 999 . But in the header file it is written no limit .
Again i tried to fork  more than 512( this number i gor from
www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/tlk/tlk.html , process section ) the system got
hanged and even the reset button was not working . I am linux 2.2.12
kernel which i think is stable .  Again  i din't find the value
MAX_TASKS_PER_USER defined in linux/tasks.h not used in the kernel . Is
that i missed the file containing it . But then it should come in fork.c
.  Putting all together is there any per process limitation or per user
limitation .?  If not why these variables defined . Is for future
support . Why setrlimit  with corresponding option . ? Can any one
elaborate on these things . Or can any point to me any good url which
explain these things ?
                TIA
regards
aneesh
