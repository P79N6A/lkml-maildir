In the past, I've compiled kernels with math emulation "just in case". 
That was in that time that if my with-fpu machine would break down, I
might have to put a motherboard without FPU in there, and I liked the
prospect of being able to boot in such a case. 
So, if an FPU is present, the math emulation code should just sit 
dormant. Even when the detection then thinks that no FPU is present, 
the "illegal instruction" traps that the math emulation is based on
simply should not occur.
But even if the math emulation code is actually active, then it should 
simply work, and emulate any FPU instructions without problem.
