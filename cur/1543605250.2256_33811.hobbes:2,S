Statically into the kernel?  I don't think so.  First off, if your "static"
code isn't GPL'd you can't distribute the resultant kernel since you've
violated the GPL.  The tainted mechanism was designed for proprietary
and/or binary-only modules without a supported license.  The case you
mention above can't even exist (at least, not in any publically-accessible
code).
