oops! Initial internal version of Venki's cpuid(4) deterministic cache
parameter identification patch used static arrays of size MAX_CACHE_LEAVES. 
Final patch which made to the base used dynamic array allocation, with this
MAX_CACHE_LEAVES limit hunk still in place. 
cpuid(4) already has a mechanism to find out the number of cache levels
implemented and there is no need for this hardcoded MAX_CACHE_LEAVES limit.
