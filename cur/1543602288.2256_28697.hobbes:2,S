Yes please. The patch I committed just made it happier with a relative (or
no) root directory - it was changing into the specified directory and then
still prepending its name to every path. I assume it's still emitting a
dirent for '.' in the root directory as it was before. The JFFS2 kernel code
doesn't like that very much.
