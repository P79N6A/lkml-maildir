Hello,
Is someone working on a way to overcome the 2GB file limitation in Linux? I
currently backup several servers using a dedicated hard drive for the
backups. Recently I saw one backup die saying the the file size had been
exceeded. I've never had good luck with tape backups, yes they backup, but
whenever I really need a file, it can't be retrieved.
TIA,
Bobby
