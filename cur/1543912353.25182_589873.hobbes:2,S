I am in the process of bisecting now. It takes a while but the bad commit is
between 2.6.22 and 13f9966b3ba5b45f47f2ea0eb0a90afceedfbb1f (June 28). I'll
continue tomorrow.
My system is FC4. 
autofs-4.1.4-26
nfs-utils-1.0.7-13.FC4
By the way, the particular autofs commit Andrian sent is innocent. It's
something else.
It will still take me about 10 reboots to bisect. If anyone has a patch for
me to try, I'll give it a shot tomorrow.
