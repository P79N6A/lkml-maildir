It's true that kernel 2.2 will only compile for the ARM as ELF. 
However, you _must_ apply rmk's patches to make it work.  They can be
found on ftp.arm.linux.org.uk in /pub/armlinux/kernel-sources/v2.2/ 
I'm not sure that such a patched kernel will then compile for other
architectures; it used not to but I haven't tried this in a while.
Note that you need a recent egcs too.
