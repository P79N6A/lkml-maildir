Adding your own fanotify calls next to the fsnotify calls completely
defeats th purpose of these.  Please make sure we have one set of hooks.
And given that we now have three notification schemes I think it's
getting time that you also unifify the actuall backends (buffering, etc)
instead of faning out at the fsnotify layer and just leave dnotify and
inotify as tiny userspace interface layers.
