You could also make a strong argument that that patent is invalid
because RCU is obvious.  I was doing this with perl and SQL before I
ever heard of RCU.  If you don't want to lock a table (or didn't realize
SQL had such a thing as table locking :-) you just fetch a value, make
some calculation on it, then do the update iff that value has not
changed.  If it has changed you fetch the new value and go back to step
1.  It's just the obvious way to update a shared data structure if you
have cmpxchg but no locking.
