I also had problems with my KVM switch and mouse when I initially moved to 
2.6, but adding this kernel boot parameter fixed it, meybe it will help 
you as well :  psmouse.proto=imps
My mouse was jumping all over the screen, clicking buttons at random, but 
since I added 
append="psmouse.proto=imps"
to my lilo.conf everything has been working perfectly with every 2.6 
kernel I've tried.
My mouse is a "Logitec MouseMan Wheel" (USB mouse, but connected to the 
KVM with a USB->PS/2 adapter), my KVM switch is an old 8port thing that I 
unfortunately don't know the name/brand of since I got it used and the 
label with that info on it is gone.
 Hope that helps you :)
