	Hello,
	It's normal than a cdrom can be mounted more than once? I mean,
any user can remount a cdrom using for example mount /cdrom, and it seems
to keep cound of the times you mounted it, because you cannot eject it
until you have umounted it the same number of times.
	I'm using 2.4.0-test5-pre4, but it was also present in every
previous test5-pre?
	Thanks,
	- german
