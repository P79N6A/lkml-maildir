Not to be a nay-sayer, or even argue, I jsut wonder what the present
hot swappable IDE raid devices are doing?
Are these built with all the necessary electronics, or are they just 
rolling the dice?
I realise the OS only knows about the scsi interface to these, but they
would appear to provide hot swappable IDE disks, albeit, using a scsi
communication to the controller.
