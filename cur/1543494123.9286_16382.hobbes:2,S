Subject: Kernel size < 240kB, get_wchan in fs/proc/array.c, used from kernel/sched.c

Looks like nobody runs a kernel without proc interface.
I wanted to play here with Tyan Tiger 100 Dual Celeron made netbootable
via updating BIOS, but decided first to practice with few old
netbootable X-terminals.
Got here a Siemens Nixdorf 486sx25, which is network bootable via TCP/IP
(setup in BIOS), but is likely(AFAIK) capable to download only 243kB of
code.
The best , after patching a kernel (well, commenting out two usages of
get_wchan from kernel/sched.c for a shortcut for to switch off proc fs)
it was bzImage of  272605 bytes with 2.0.36+nextstackpatch
and        239157   with 2.0.36 without non-ex-stack-patch
configuration was:
Kernel math emulation
Networking support
Limit memory to low 16MB
Kernel support for ELF binaries
Compile kernel as ELF
(486) Processor type
TCP/IP networking
AMD LANCE and PCnet (AT1500 and NE2100) support (integrated on
motherboard)
NFS filesystem support
Root file system on NFS
PS/2 mouse (aka "auxiliary device") support ---- using serial was over
243kB
and nothing more.
Any ideas how to get it smaller (for fun) ?
