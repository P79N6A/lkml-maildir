We obviously have a very different perception of the
term "hacker". I wonder if anyone here shares yours...
It was not my intention to offend anyone, but to get
your attention on what seems to be a forgotten detail:
kernel size. 
It has nothing to do with who I am or what platform am
I working on or those annoying emails nagging you. It
is about making Linux better. "Better" may have
different meanings for different people. For most
"faster" is the closest. You optimize for speed.
Adding a second criterion (size) would only increase
the value of the code. 
Keep up the good work, and your ego down,
Gigi
