That won't work.  You'd have to plunk it all into a pot, and divvy it up by 
%cpu usage or something.  I solved it the simple way.  I keep a smoothed 
run_avg (%cpu * 100), and use that as a sleep_avg limit... ie if you're 
run_avg is 9000 (you're eating 10% cpu), no sleep will push you into 
insanity land.  I still have the problem that tasks will seek their 
appropriate priority level and _stick_ there, so I probably need to add 
some decay. (which will no doubt open the next can-O-worms)
