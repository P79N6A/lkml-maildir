Would it even be worthwhile to propose a patch that would set a flag 
when pivot_root is called during an initrd and prevent change_root from 
occuring once the linuxrc thread exits?
Your method of placing "initrx=xxx" and "root=xxx" is similar to my 
method of stuffing those values into /proc/sys/kernel/real_root_dev once 
the pivot_root is complete; I am not really happy with that solution, 
not the least of which because it is an undocumented work-around and 
somewhat unexpected behavior for a system call that is to (presumably) 
replace or augment change_root.
I was also hoping that Warner or Hans would chime-in either in defense 
of the current documentation or with clarifications...
