my understanding is that knfsd wants to use inode numbers in the handles
that it passes out to clients (which must persis across server restarts). 
and inode numbers are not unique across filesystems.  what I don't know is
why it can't hash the inode with some per-FS id to accomplish the obviously
desirable behavior.  is it that re-exporting the same file two ways 
presents a permissions/accounting pain? 
thanks, mark hahn.
