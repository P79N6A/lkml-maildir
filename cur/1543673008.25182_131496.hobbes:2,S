We replaced the bad drive and are restoring home directories.
Once we have the restore done, we'll turn on people's accounts again.
We are shutting off nightly backups for a few days so that we have 
the backups to cherry pick any missing config files, etc.
This bad disk is the cause of the CVS gateway being screwed up, we should
have that back online tonight or tomorrow.  Sorry about the downtime.
Peter, once it's back can you do whatever you did to get the resync stuff
going (if you put a startup script in /etc/init.d, don't worry about it, 
I'll restore that and restart).
Dave, I put RH 7.3 on there but didn't install any security fixes, you get
to do that fun job if you care.
