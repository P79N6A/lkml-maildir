atomic_set/atomic_read are _atomic_ operations. Nothing is said about
ordering. You get old or new but not half and half. Two atomic_inc's
will both occur and so on.
If you want ordering you need locks otherwise there is nothing defining
the time order of both processors.
How can you even measure such a window without locking to know what the
state of the processors is ?

Then you will get burned on most hardware.
