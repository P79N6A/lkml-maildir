   	The macro "min(n1,n2)", is a very standard practice in C
   programming.
If min() in it's "very standard practice" form is broken at
the core, breaking it like I have is a fix.
Let this go till Linus returns from Finland in a week or so,
I'm sure he'll be more than happy to state why he wanted
me to do these changes.
Later,
