Hi,
This is probably a BIOS / hardware bug, a rare occurence actually.
The logs show:
#v+
acpi_power-0363 [64] acpi_power_transition : Error transitioning device [CFAN] to D0
acpi_bus-0496 [63] acpi_bus_set_power    : Error transitioning device [CFAN] to D0
acpi_thermal-0549 [62] acpi_thermal_active   : Unable to turn cooling device [c12d2528] 'on'
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 876c33c4
[...]
#v-
(sometimes there's D3 in place of D0, depending on the trip points /
temperature readings), and then the oops follows. Unfortunately, I
can't provide the ksymoops output, as the kernel which the oops was logged
on has been gone long since.
Anyway, this is by no means reproducible, occurs quasi-randomly (more often
when the machine is cold, possibly due to the fact that actual state
transitions take place then), and causes various effects from keventd /
ACPI subsystem locking to system hangs.
Hope that helps, best regards,
