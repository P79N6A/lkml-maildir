Where people run into trouble with this, is when they simply go to
move a huge file (DVD image) from one directory to another,
where the target happens to be on a different bind point of the
same underlying filesystem.
This can happen in a variety of common ways, including accessing
over CIFS or Samba.
And the result is a very very long delay while we copy 4-8GB of data
instead of simply moving the link.
