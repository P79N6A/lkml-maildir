This is not just about memory sharing. Dynamic resource management is 
hardly possible in a model where you have multiple kernels running; all 
of those kernel were designed to run on a dedicated hardware. As it was 
pointed out, adding/removing memory from a Xen guest during runtime is 
tricky.
Finally, multiple-kernels-on-top-of-hypervisor architecture is just more 
complex and has more overhead then one-kernel-with-many-namespaces.

OpenVZ will have live zero downtime migration and suspend/resume some

This point is controversial. Tools are tools -- they can be made to 
support Xen, Linux VServer, UML, OpenVZ, VMware -- or even all of them!
But anyway, speaking of tools and better admin operations, what it takes 
to create a Xen domain (I mean create all those files needed to run a 
new Xen domain), and how much time it takes? Say, in OpenVZ creation of 
a VE (Virtual Environment) is a matter of unpacking a ~100MB tarball and 
copying 1K config file -- which essentially means one can create a VE in 
a minute. Linux-VServer should be pretty much the same.
Another concern is, yes, manageability. In OpenVZ model the host system 
can easily access all the VPSs' files, making, say, a mass software 
update a reality. You can easily change some settings in 100+ VEs very 
easy. In systems based on Xen and, say, VMware one should log in into 
each system, one by one, to administer them, which is not unlike the 
'separate physical server' model.

Indeed, a mixed approach is very interesting. You can run OpenVZ or 
Linux-VServer in a Xen domain, that makes a lot of sense.
