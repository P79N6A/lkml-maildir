Subject: [PATCH 11/50] KVM: MMU: Ignore reserved bits in cr3 in non-pae mode
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/23/82

From: Ryan Harper <ryanh@us.ibm.com>
This patch removes the fault injected when the guest attempts to set reserved
bits in cr3.  X86 hardware doesn't generate a fault when setting reserved bits.
The result of this patch is that vmware-server, running within a kvm guest,
boots and runs memtest from an iso.
