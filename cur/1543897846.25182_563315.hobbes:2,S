No, that's not fair.  But, what's fair is to ask maintainers of $PROGRAM to 
be so kind and expose a stable API via some layer, which can be used to 
connect external patches which are considered not useful, in the hope that 
some day it may grow into something useful.

Ok, so some people made a mistake, and now everybody has to suffer?
What we need is a solution.  What is your suggestion?
Would a stable API exposing wrapper module be feasible?
Thanks!
