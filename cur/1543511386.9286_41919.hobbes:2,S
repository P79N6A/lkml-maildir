It's useless from the protocol point of view.
But it's much more convenient for manual tcpdump control.
I prefer to be able to check easily that id generation works as expected.

I really hate any special values :-)
For IP IDs I've already seen special value 0 in another place.
If I'm forced to use special values they should at least be different for
different purposes.  Otherwise we may create a real mess by an accident.
