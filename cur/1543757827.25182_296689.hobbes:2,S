OK, so we're looking for the buffer_head for block 101 and the first
buffer_head which is attached to the page represents block 100.  So the
next buffer_head _should_ represent block 101.  Please print it out:

Could be UFS.  But what does "transparent block encryption and sector
shuffling" mean?  How is the sector shuffling implemented?
