Think of it like designing a cpu.  Which would you rather have a
faster clock rate or a new instruction say floating point multiply-accumulate
that means you theoretically double your floating point computation speed 
at a cost of reducing your clock rate?
Up to the limit of it being possible you get more bang out of improving
the little things.  CPUs unfortunately pretty much hit the limit of
improving clock rates.
I don't think we are at the limit of making small things like syscalls,
and pages go fast.
