The results look very promising, although I'm a bit surprised that 2.5
is actually that much quicker :-)
The bounce counts you are doing don't make too much sense to me though,
how come 2.4 + block-high and 2.5 show any bounced numbers at all? Maybe
you are not doing the accounting correctly? To get the right counts do
something ala:
+++ mm/highmem.c
@@ -409,7 +409,9 @@
                        vfrom = kmap(from->bv_page) + from->bv_offset;
                        memcpy(vto, vfrom, to->bv_len);
                        kunmap(from->bv_page);
-               }
+                       bounced_write++;
+               } else
+                       bounced_read++;
        }
Of course those are all bounces, not just (or only) swap bounces. Also
note that the above is not SMP safe.
