So you saved 4 bytes. What about saving 20+ lines and killing
pointer_lock? 
SMP development is difficult enough, and I prefer if everyone uses a few
primitives (semphore, spinlock, rw_sem, rw_lock) instead of special
functions.
And if you use spin_lock_bh(), then we would allow smp_call_function()
from bottom half handlers - might be important for hardware drivers.
i386 allows that.
