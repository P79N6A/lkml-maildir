I just tried -test8-mm1 on a 256p/128 node machine and these changes
almost work.  I still needed to change ZONE_SHIFT from BITS_PER_LONG - 8
to BITS_PER_LONG - 10 because of the way set_page_zone() is called from
memmap_init_zone() (set_page_zone(page, nid * MAX_NR_ZONES + zone);).
So shouldn't ZONE_SHIFT be BITS_PER_LONG -  NODES_SHIFT or something?
