Will we see a patch for 2.4.22-23 too? (Nudge nudge wink wink)
If this information is of any use for you, I was playing with a SiI 3112
yesterday (Abit mobo, Athlon XP2500 1800 MHz, Seagate 120MB 7200 RPM SATA
drive) and noticed that, while with 2.4.22-ac4 I had a hdparm -t result of
16 MB/sec, with 2.4.23-pre6 I got 25 MB/sec -- which is still less than the
32-33 MB/sec I get with normal ATA. Does that make any sense?

Standard FIS packet size is 8K.
