Transarc may not be a good example here; many of the tricky bits of
AFS stay in userland, where it's much easier to port things.
It is still possible to port an entirely in-kernel filesystem without
_too_ much pain, though -- I'm doing it now for a filesystem based on
our NASD research that was originally written for OSF1. Apart from
some cache issues, the port process has been surprisingly painless.
