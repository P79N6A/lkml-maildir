I apologize if this is a repeat question.  I didn't see my own question
come by on the mailing list though.
I have been wondering how to get the new dnotify parts currently in
<linux/fcntl.h> into <fcntl.h>.  I have recompiled and entirley rebuilt
gcc with the --with-headers option in an effort to get it to
incorporate the new stuff from <linux/fcntl.h>.  Is this an false
expectation?  Do I have to submit the changes to the glibc folks to get
them into the <fcntl.h>?
