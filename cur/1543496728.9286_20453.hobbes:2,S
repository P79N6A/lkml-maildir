there are two different issues here. First, the branch is an 'unlikely'
case, and it's a forward branch. This means we'll never take it in most
cases. Sane CPUs predict (branch-history less) forward branches as not
taken. 
the other issue is converting that code to do proper SMP locking. Since
2.0 many areas of the kernel were slightly changed to have a single point
of exit, this eases SMP locking/unlocking later on. (in that case the exit
point might do an unlock, which we obviously do not want to inline like in
your suggestions).
