I do a lot of looking at large hunks of code I'm not familiar with and
trying to figure out how it works.  It's quite handy to grep for
foo_func to see all usages, then ^foo_func to see the function.  I guess
my preferred style favors people trying to grok code for the first time,
while the kernel style favors those who know it inside out.
Anyway, the coding style guidelines also state clearly that these points
are not up for debate on LKML so I'll stop now...
