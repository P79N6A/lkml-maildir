Hi
When I exit from su in X, it takes about 10 seconds to return
to the command prompt. This doesn't happen in console mode.
I'm using Mandrake 8.1.
This didn't happen in 
  2.4.17-mjc1
But does happen in
  2.4.18-pre7-ac2
  2.4.19-pre2
I know this is not exactly a major problem or anything, 
but it's starting to bug me :) 
Anyone got any ideas?
Nick
