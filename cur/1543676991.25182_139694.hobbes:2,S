There was a project to do this in ext2, but I don't remember
what happened to it - I think that at the end is simpler to
do that at the user level (think something like Gnome VFS or
KDE's KIOs).

Mr. Van Riel? Where are you?

Having a tmpfs mounted in /tmp does the trick, more or less. 
Then it is a matter of discipline: if a file is temporary, 
stick it somewhere in /tmp.

What for? They are too slow; given the price of a gigabyte now, 
and taking into account that IDE drives can store more than tapes,
it makes little sense (I would even say for long-term storage).
YMMV, though.
