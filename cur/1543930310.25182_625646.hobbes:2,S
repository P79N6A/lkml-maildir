to me this looks like an ABI regression - utilities should work without 
change. Something changed in /sys output that caused HAL to think that 
there are two batteries:
| The output of lshal shows that there are two UDI's with 
| info.capabilities = { 'battery' }:
|
| udi = '/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/acpi_BAT0'
| udi = '/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer_power_supply_0'
whether it's a HAL bug or a kernel bug, the original state should be 
restored and it should be worked out without breaking users of older HAL 
versions.
grumble: way too many times do various system utilities break when i 
upgrade the kernel on my laptop. Maybe a new debug mechanism: we should 
start fingerprinting the exact /sys and /proc output and enforce that 
it's immutable across kernel releases as long as the hardware is 
unmodified?
