Ok, the bug is found now. It is a kernel bug that it allows to set
non canonical addresses in 64bit segment registers through ptrace.
But even if I fixed that then it will not help you run UML, because
UML needs to set correct addresses of course, not illegal ones.
I will submit a patch later for the crash problem.
