The "As it happens... efficient way." sentence is hard to read:  It is
long and nested like in German, combined with several English
ambiguities (e.g. WRT noun vs. verb vs. adjective).  Maybe just leave
this sentence out, as it is redundant to later statements like "In
properly-written kernel code, volatile can only serve to slow things down".
