Subject: linux 2.6-pre1 : make xconfig fails because "include/asm" rule is not called early enough
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Wanted to give a try and immediately failed on this one.
HOSTCC scripts/fixdep
....
asm/socket.h: No such file or directory (no link for include/asm to 
include/asm-i386)
NOTE : calling "Make include/asm" and then xconfig works...
Not a problem, just annoying
