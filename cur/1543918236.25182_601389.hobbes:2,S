Hi Atul/Randy,
[CCing to LKML]
Thinking more about it, looks like scanning command line is not a very good
idea.
I think we should instead look for if total available RAM in the system and
then let driver make a decision about how much memory to allocate. Pavel
already suggested it on LKML and I like the idea.
This is more generic and can be applied to kdump, kexec based hibernation and
all the future users of kexec on panic infrstrcuture which will boot a 
second kernel in restricted amount of RAM.
I am not sure what's the best way to determine the total RAM in the system
in arch independent manner. Some VM guys can tell it better. One of the ways
could be to parse /proc/iomem, the way kexec-tools does. Balbir mentioned
that traverse through the nodes and sum up present_pages. 
Any suggestions, what's the best way to determine total amount of RAM
in the system in kernel?
Right now this seems to be one odd case so this code can be inside module.
If there are more users of it then we can probably create a flag inside
kernel and export it.
Thanks
Vivek
