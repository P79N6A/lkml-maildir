It is particularly notable when someone inserts a Cardbus device.  A
new PCI device is added, and we scan all drivers looking for a match
using the PCI ID tables.
If _any_ PCI ID table which is part registered as part of a driver is
marked using __devinitdata or __initdata, this will either cause the
kernel to read invalid data (possibly entering a long loop) or oops.
