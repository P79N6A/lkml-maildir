Yes.  SUSv3 says POLLHUP, POLLERR and POLLNVAL are always reported
even if not requested.

Take a look at the new subject line :)
Linux select() treats it as an input-only condition, implying that
there might be useful things you can do with output to a file
descriptor that's reporting POLLHUP, including waiting for output.
However, SUSv3 says "This event [POLLHUP]and POLLOUT are mutually
exclusive; a stream can never be writable if a hangup has occurred",
implying that Linux select() is the oddity.

I agree, in fact I'd argue specifically against changing it.
Programmers familiar with poll() know that you don't have to set
POLLHUP in the input mask -- because SUSv3 says so ("This flag
[POLLHUP] is only valid in the revents bitmask; it is ignored in the
events member").  They'd not be likely to notice a difference that
subtle for epoll, when they convert application code, so it's good
that there isn't a difference.
Btw, I notice epoll never reports POLLNVAL.  Is that correct?
