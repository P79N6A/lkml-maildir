That is a very good question.
The Single UNIX ® Specification, Version 2 has the following to say.
If _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO is defined and synchronised I/O is enabled on the 
file associated with aiocbp->aio_fildes, the behaviour of this function is 
according to the definitions of synchronised I/O data integrity completion 
and synchronised I/O file integrity completion.
Maybe a was a little bit too fast in blaming glibc. I will go and look for 
more documentation about disabling synchronised I/O on a socket.
Dup()licating the socket handle is an easy workaround, but now i am 
convinced, a little bit man page digging will be lots of fun.
I hope the efforts of Benjamin LaHaise receive more attention and as soon as 
i know more about disabling synchronised I/O on sockets i will send an other 
email.
