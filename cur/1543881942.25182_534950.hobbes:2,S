And it just occurred to me PSE disabled, otherwise you would not have
needed more than 4 pages.  I supposed you were testing the Xen case.
That said I know for certain now why we have never seen this in
production because all cpus that fit this configuration also support
PSE.
So the way I think we should properly fix this is:
- Enable PAE early so we are updating our current page table.
- Pass a limit to the bootmem allocator so we do not get pages
  pass the point where we have setup page tables.
- Handle memory allocation failures.
However only the first part is necessary to solve the problem,
in practice even if you are using 4K pages.
