Subject: [PATCH] Trivial patch for SIOCGIFCOUNT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello Linus, Alan, David,
	To make the API orthogonal, I have included a patch for SIOCGIFCOUNT,
which currently returns -EINVAL. The only reason I am providing this patch
is to make the API complete and make it easier to port applications from
other UNIX like OS'es.
I have verified and am sure that this patch works. The priority of this patch
is not very high, but it would be good to have a orthogonal/complete API.
The patch is against 2.4.2-2 (official rh 7.1). I can provide one against 2.4.10
or 2.4.10-pre16 if required.
