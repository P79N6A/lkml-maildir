Hi Christoph,
after your removal of #include <linux/buffer_head.h> from fs.h ide-tape.c
no longer compiles:
<--  snip  -->
...
gcc -D__KERNEL__
-I/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.5/linux-2.5.18-modular/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common

-include /home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.5/linux-2.5.18-modular/include/linux/modversions.h
-DKBUILD_BASENAME=ide_tape  -c -o ide-tape.o ide-tape.c
ide-tape.c: In function `__idetape_kmalloc_stage':
ide-tape.c:2810: `BH_Lock' undeclared (first use in this function)
ide-tape.c:2810: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
ide-tape.c:2810: for each function it appears in.)
...
<--  snip  -->
The following patch (made against 2.5.18-dj1 but it should apply cleanly
against 2.5.18) fixes it (I wasn't able to find an obvious ordering of the
"#include <linux/*>" so I placed it at the end):
--- drivers/ide/ide-tape.c.old	Sun May 26 22:55:56 2002
+++ drivers/ide/ide-tape.c	Sun May 26 22:56:42 2002
