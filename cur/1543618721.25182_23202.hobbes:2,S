I tried to compile the O(1) patch on the powerpc kernel (using
BenH's latest greatest).  But it didn't work.  It puked on the
counter and processor stuff in mk_def.c:4[01] in arch/powerpc/kernel
Is this patch just incompatable with the powerpc in some way, or is
it something that hasn't been addressed because Ingo has only ia32
systems at his disposal?
Ciao!
