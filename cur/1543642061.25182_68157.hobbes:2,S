   Notes:
     * Off-list  email sent to me regarding these reports is much 
appreciated. Relevant comments to a problem report will
       be added to the discussion thread unless specifically requested not 
to. If you do send me a comment, please CC the
       list.
     * Great  progress has been made in forward porting IDE driver code 
from 2.4 to 2.5. Several people have tried 2.5.33
       without disaster. Updates continue to be added to the -ac kernels 
and the 2.5 bitkeeper kernels.
     * Floppy  support  is  currently  semi-broken/semi-fixed  in  2.5.  
The  driver currently works (as of 2.5.33-bk) on
       filesystems  with  512-byte  blocks  (e.g. vfat/msdos) but has 
produced corruption on filesystems with other block
       sizes  such as ext2, minix, etc. Update: Several fixes to the 
floppy driver itself and the bio layer have improved
       things. This needs more testing and confirmation that the fix is 
in.
     * Support for __FUNCTION__ pasting is being phased out of gcc. This 
has broken compiling in numerous places. Defines
       of the form:
       #define func_enter() sx_dprintk (SX_DEBUG_FLOW, "sx: enter " 
__FUNCTION__ "\n")
       need to be changed to the form:
       #define func_enter() sx_dprintk (SX_DEBUG_FLOW, "sx: enter %s\n", 
__FUNCTION__)
     * Items  marked with "No further discussion" have not had any 
additional comments posted to the mailing list for one
       or more development point releases. These items will be archived 
when Linus issues the next point release.
