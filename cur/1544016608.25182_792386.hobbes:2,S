I found it not easy given the required sequence of operations:
For this specific bug, opregion DIDL entry must be set before the
*first* _DOD invocation, i.e. the ACPI video module loading time.
This means 
        - opregion module must be loaded before ACPI video module
        - the opregion DIDL setting code must run in module init time,
          instead of the current implemented startx time.
          However, how can the opregion module get the right DIDL data
          without the help of Xorg and intel driver? Maybe kernel mode
          setting?
So the module dependencies could be:
        ACPI video => i915 opregion => kernel mode setting
The latter dependency should be a reasonable one, but does the first
one make sense in general?
Or is it possible to delay the first _DOD invocation in ACPI video?
Thanks,
Fengguang
