agreed. Context-switching is 10 times less frequent on most workloads 
than syscalls, so if it takes 10 cycles in the context-switch path to 
eliminate a 1 cycle overhead in the syscall-entry path then we are still 
break-even on average. In this case the overhead is similar i think, so 
the switch_to() fix is preferable.
