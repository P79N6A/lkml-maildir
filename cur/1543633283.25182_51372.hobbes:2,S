Is there any good example code for compiling a kernel module
externally, that works for modversions etc. on 2.2, 2.4, and 2.5,
and does the right thing (including Rules.make) ?
I'm having an awful time working out the exact incantations.
On a related note, is it at all possible to make a "mini filesystem"
that will work on 2.2 upwards, so I can avoid proc,sysctl, and ioctl ?
thanks
john
