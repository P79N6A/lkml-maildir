As a general rule, regparm(1) makes code smaller.  Above that it stands
getting larger again.  I've never timed the difference.

Much of the assembler code is declared with __fastcall: a macro saying
to pass the arguments in registers anyway!
The system calls are done with asmlinkage; you could add regparm(0) to
that so you don't have to change the assembly code, or change the code
in entry.S to put the first parameter in %eax.  There are probably a few
other functions declared with asmlinkage to be considered.
A few difficult ones: the things that take `struct pt_regs' such as
sys_fork and sys_clone.  They're called from entry.S and expect a stack
full of registers which can be treated as a struct pt_regs -- and they
pass the address of that to other functions.  You'd need special
treatment for those.
It's probably best to start by adding regparm(0) to asmlinkage.
A few assembly things such as the semaphore code call C functions with
stack conventions -- that'd need fixing up.  You can hack the semaphore
case by putting regparm(0) in the right places in the C code.
