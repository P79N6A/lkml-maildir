I suspect I did, but most likey the wrong place.  In any case, I would like to 
think that "read the source, Luke" is the right answer.
So, while I am in the asking mode, is there a simple way to turn off the PIT 
interrupt without changing the PIT program?  I would like a way to stop the 
interrupts AND also stop the NMIs that it generates for the watchdog.  I suspect 
that this is a bit more complex that it would appear, due to how its wired.
