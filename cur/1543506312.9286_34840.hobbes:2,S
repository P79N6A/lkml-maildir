Ok, I've tried this twice before, with no apparent success. If this
hits the list, can someone please respond to me and let me know it
worked?
I'm in need of some pointers on how to proceed with a problem I have
when trying to use a PCMCIA IDE device.
The problem manifests as follows:
I insert the Nikon Coolpix 100 (a digital camera with a PCMCIA IDE
hard disk interface) into my laptop. Nikon claim the interface is a
'standard IDE interface', and won't provide any more detail.
The PCMCIA routines fire up, detect the IDE controller, negotiate
everything as they are supposed to, and send all the info over to the
kernel IDE drivers.
The kernel IDE drivers attempt to talk to the IDE device and fail
miserably, finally giving up and rejecting the drive.
The events leading to this are as follows (from my logs):
exec 'insmod /lib/modules/2.2.11-ac3/pcmcia/ide_cs.o'
hde: probing with STATUS(0x50) instead of ALTSTATUS(0x51)
(repeated 10 more times)
ide_cs: ide_register() at 0x100 & 0x10e, irq 3 failed
(repeated 9 more times)
I don't mind doing some digging myself, and I know C rather well.
However, I have never dug into the kernel at all and have no
experience with drivers or IDE. I would like a pointer as to what I 
should look for or where to begin. Of course, if the solution is
obvious, I won't mind if someone fixes it right away. :)
I'm using RedHat 6.0 with some compatibility fixes, kernel 2.2.11 with 
the ac3 update, PCMCIA drivers 3.0.13 (there is a 3.0.14, but it
doesn't address this issue at all, I have been in contact with the
PCMCIA maintainer about this too).
Thanks for your time,
Jesper
