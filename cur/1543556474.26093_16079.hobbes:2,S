Is the bforget patch really needed?
If clear_inode() gets rid of dirty buffers, I don't see how new dirty
buffers can magically appear. I may have missed part of the discussion on
all this.
I think that the second patch from Al (the inode dirty meta-data) is the
_real_ fix, and I don't see why the bforget changes should matter.
