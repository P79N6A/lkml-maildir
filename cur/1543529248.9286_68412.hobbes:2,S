My paralle port epson (stylus 440) printer is not being detected.  All
the models appear to be loaded. 
parport_probe           2980   0  (autoclean) (unused)
lp                      4476   0  (autoclean) (unused) parport 7124   0 
(autoclean) [parport_probe lp] 
I don't know why it is not seeing the printer.  I know everything is
loaded through the kernel.  It worked with Redhat 6.0  but not with the
new kernel in Redhat 6.1 (kernel 2.2.12-20).
Please help. No printer sucks
