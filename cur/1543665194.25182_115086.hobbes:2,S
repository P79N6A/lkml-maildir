A unified diff would have been much more readable.
You now have one more reference to ->f_vfsmnt and ->f_dentry, so I
suspect you're missing one mntget() and one dget() above. The usual
impact of a too low ref count is that the object is reassigned while
you're still using it, with memory corruption & oopses as the result.
