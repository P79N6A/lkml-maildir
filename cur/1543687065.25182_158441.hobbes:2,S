Back in March, there was some discussion about ratelimiting the
BSDCOMPAT errors, and James Morris provided a patch to achieve
this.

To which David Miller stated the patch had been applied.

Unfortunately, it seems to have fallen through the cracks.  Below
is the patch again, updated for 2.6.0-test3 - please apply.
