If we are looking at these things I have some gnawing suspicions
that a constant 0xFFFFFFFFUL at line 489 of lib/vsprintf.c
in this function:
    int vsprintf(char *buf, const char *fmt, va_list args)
    {
            return vsnprintf(buf, 0xFFFFFFFFUL, fmt, args);
    }
was really meant to be (size_t)(-1).  It is not the same if a platform
is not 32 bits.  Roland, what do you think?
