Well, it was a chance :) However, I had io_32bit=1 but I
also had a freeze even after setting it back to 0.

I found a few things: 1st: it happens when the disk is
loaded: best way to freeze the system here is a find over
a big subtree (something around 60.000 files in lots of
directories, ext2), better some of them in parallel
and even better some find -print0 | xargs -0 cat > /dev/null.
But even there: it doesnt happen all time, the chances
just grow up.
2nd: it seems, the disk spins down short before the error
appears. At least all time when I was in front of the
machine when the problem appeared, I heard the disk spinning
down - just as if it was gone to standby mode.
But it was definitely loaded before (I hear the head seeks
and then the spindown). And no, I dont have any automated
spindown like noflushd or something like that.
CC:ing to lkm again. Probably this helps somehow.
regards,
   Mario
