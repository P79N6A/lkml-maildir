   set_pte() establishes the mapping, this means another cpu can get the pte 
   and start reading the data e.g. into the instruction cache, but if that 
   cpu still has dirty data in the data cache (e.g. a write() or a disk 
   read), the following update_mmu_cache() might be too late.
If that really matters for you, your set_pte() could add this
operation to a list of pending set_pte()'s in the mm_struct arch
specific context area.  Then at update_mmu_cache() it runs this
list of todo items.
I don't see the problem.
