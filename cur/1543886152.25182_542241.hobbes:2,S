correct, while this discussion started over the PCI_MULTITHREAD_PROBE it's 
focusing on the generic problem that would apply to any bus

I don't think anyone is saying that PCI is the problem here. We're trying 
to identify what needs to be done for any arbatrary bus, if a particular 
bus doesn't need to split it's initialization up becouse there are no 
delays (and therefor no gains for multithreading) then drivers for that 
bus don't bother to implement any async portion.
