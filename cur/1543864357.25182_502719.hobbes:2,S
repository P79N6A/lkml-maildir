Yes, the "ineffective reclaim" is more of an issue with this than
linear, and the cost metric we are working on should help us show that;
and then help us evaluate the utility of pushing the pages back without
releasing them.

Yes, what was obvious from the linear against lumpy was that the only
valid comparison was on the 'effectiveness' metric (which was basically
the same) and code complexity (where lumpy clearly wins).  But we have
no feel for 'cost'.  We are working on a cost metric for reclaim which
we can use to compare performance.

Yes this is actually IMO wrong for not doing this, and I've updated it.

Yes, though the ones I have seem sane the output isn't stable and we're
investigating that right now.
