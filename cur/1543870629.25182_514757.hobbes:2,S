That could be challenging, when multiple writers are working in
parallel. You may not be able to return -ENOSPC, till you fail the
allocation (for filesystems which alllocates a block at a time).

Yes. What I was trying to figure out is, if there is a requirement that
interface need to return exact number of bytes it *really* allocated
(like write() or read()). I can't think of any, but just wanted to
through it out..
BTW, what is the interface for finding out what is the size of the
pre-allocated file ? 
Thanks,
