My intention was to help speed up the Union Mount effort by ensuring
that patches don't rot waiting for developer's attention. Going by the
past interactions, I got a feeling that you have lot of other work
besides this, while I have time to spare on this. Hence wanted to do my
bit to get patches moving as quickly as possible.
As I have conveyed to you many times, I would still like you to maintain
the patches and send out as timely as possible on lkml. If you can't do
this because of your other commitments, then I would more than willing
to maintain these and give them maximum attention.
And thanks for making available the patches publicly, I have been asking
this for months now.
Regards,
Bharata.
