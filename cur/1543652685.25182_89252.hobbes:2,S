Hi,
The recient modules changes are 'fun'.  
First the Docs have not been updated.  A quick search of lkml found Rusty's
new utilities...  After that booting worked a little better...
Here is what complains here:
Module ip_tables cannot be unloaded due to unsafe usage in net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c:1385
Module tulip cannot be unloaded due to unsafe usage in drivers/net/tulip/tulip_core.c:487
Module pl2303 cannot be unloaded due to unsafe usage in drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c:1408
Module snd cannot be unloaded due to unsafe usage in fs/proc/inode.c:204
Module agpgart cannot be unloaded due to unsafe usage in drivers/char/agp/agp.c:67
Module pppox cannot be unloaded due to unsafe usage in drivers/net/pppox.c:52
And these will not load at all.
via_rhine: Unknown symbol mii_ethtool_gset
matroxfb_base: Unknown symbol matroxfb_global_mxinfo
scsi_mod: Unknown symbol module_dummy_usage
usb_storage: Unknown symbol scsi_register
I also had to modprobe a few modules manually, for instance, psmouse...
The via_rhine load failure is a killer here - its connected to my DSL modem...
Hope this helps,
Ed Tomlinson
