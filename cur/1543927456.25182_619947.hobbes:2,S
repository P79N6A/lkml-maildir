Not to belabor this point, but it was:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/20/53
$ grep -l INDIRECT_PARAM .git/patches/master/*
.git/patches/master/indirect-v4-4.patch
.git/patches/master/indirect-v4-5.patch
.git/patches/master/indirect-v4-6.patch
Maybe the patches got to you out of order so you saw 5/ before 4/?
