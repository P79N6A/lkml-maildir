Yes, just do it. If anything turns out to be wrong I'll fix it in
one of the following releases of 2.5. At the moment the compat stuff
is broken for s390x anyway and we have to look into it in the new year.
You have my blessing for ANY change that moves code from architecture
to common code files. If it doesn't fits 100% we can take care of that
later on.
