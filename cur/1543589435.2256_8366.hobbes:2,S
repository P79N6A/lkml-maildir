You're right, this is a problem, your solution is not entirely correct
though (the south bridge has to be checked, but the patch is to the config
registers of the pci-host bridge).  Please see my patch posted on this list
with subject "Re: 2.4.4 Sound corruption [PATCH] NEW, ignore previous
patch".
