Hi there,
I think someone else notices this too, but anyway, i write down my 
experiences.
I've tested 2.4.19rc[1|2|3], AC tree, AA tree, jam tree and mjc tree
All of them shows up the same behaviour. If i do some disk i/o, f.e.:
tar xzpf linux-2.4.18.tar.gz; rm -rf linux-2.4.18
the system stopps reacting while untar/ungzipping the file for more than 5 
seconds. Nothing but the mouse reacts. This does NOT occur with 2.4.18 and 
early 2.4.19-pre's ...
System is a Celeron 800MHz, 256 MB RAM, EIDE UDMA100 Intel BX440 running ext3 
filesystem.
If you need more informations tell me what and I provide them.
If this is already fixed by someone, please tell me :-)
Please CC, i am not subscribed!
