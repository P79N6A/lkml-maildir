For the older AGP devices you can always map the data through the AGP
aperture, no ? (It also has a size limit, but that can be usually
increased in the BIOS setup) 
This won't work for graphic cards put into PCI slots, but these
can probably tolerate some performance degradation.
For AMD all PCI IO can be done through the aperture anyways, only
Intel is more crippled in this regard.

With no aperture I guess?
