Do you mean?
# mv ping ping.real
# chmod -s ping.real
# mkcapwrap +net_raw ping
# chmod +s ping
# showcapwrap ping
invokes /bin/ping.real
grants net_raw

The wrapper needs to setuid/gid to the uid/gid that invokes it.
uid root with no caps (or few caps) is still very powerful (replace 
binaries owned by root, read /etc/shadow, etc).
Currently all capabilities are cleared when non-root app does a execp. 
This would need to be addressed.
