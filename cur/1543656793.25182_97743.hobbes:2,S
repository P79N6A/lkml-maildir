Well, generic BAR probing certainly isn't avoidable right now, that's for
sure. But we might make it less common, by doing it only "on demand", and
having default drivers for pci-pci bus bridges, for example (where the
default driver would do what we do now, but perhaps a way to register
specific bus drivers that know more about their specifics).
I don't think there are any real reasons to change what we do now - it
sounds like even David doesn't actually have any devices that actually
_need_ the disable as-is.
