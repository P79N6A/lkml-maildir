i agree, and i just did a quick test and noticed that, if you try to
declare a function thusly:
  f() __attribute__((noreturn)) ;
you get:
  warning: data definition has no type or storage class
but gcc doesn't complain if you declare it thusly:
  __attribute__((noreturn)) f() ;
that strikes me as a flaw in gcc, no?
