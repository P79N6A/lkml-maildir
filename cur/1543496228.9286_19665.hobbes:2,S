Doesn't Mindcraft 3 (aka, Return of the Penguin) also have a single 
CPU, 512 mb ram test too?
My main problem with their tests are the use of the Win95 clients 
(now Windows NT), and the use of Apache for a static webserver speed 
test (when Zeus has been shown to be up to 3 times faster serving 
static pages). The test should also be run at a slightly less biased 
site than ZD labs (though they have a lot to lose if they are shown 
to be biased) using off the shelf hardware and production drivers.
If I had my way then the test would also include a water pistol 
shootout between the Linux kernel team and the Microsoft board :-)
