   Nobody knows why this patch works.  (Really!)  But it does.
   (Really!)  It makes the sym53c8xx driver work even with some very
   old 53c810 chips.  Without this patch, the driver hangs on them.
   This is reproducible....
I would suggest that this change goes through Gerard Roudier, the
maintainer of this driver.  Especially since I do know he does have a
large set of other updates for his drivers scheduled for 2.2.18
Later,
