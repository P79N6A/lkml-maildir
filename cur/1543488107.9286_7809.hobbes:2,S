Dave I have a guess.

The congestion window of NT is still 1 because it sent out only 35 bytes
of data. It will become 2 when NT will have sent out 1460 byte of data.
Do you think my guess could be right? Is NT allowed to increase the
congestion window counting the number of full-sized packets that are been
acked, instead of counting the number of in-order ack that it gets (as
Linux does).
I don't own NT and check if my guess is right is not easy for me...
