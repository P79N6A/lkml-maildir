It certainly looks like DMA is enabled.  Under 2.4 I get:
[root@lap root]# hdparm /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 2584/240/63, sectors = 39070080, start = 0
Under 2.6  I get:
[root@lap root]# hdparm /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 256 (on)
 geometry     = 38760/16/63, sectors = 39070080, start = 0
Relevant items from my 2.6 configuration file:
CONFIG_GENERIC_ISA_DMA=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_FORCED is not set
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y
# CONFIG_IDEDMA_ONLYDISK is not set
# CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_WIP is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ADMA=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
# CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB is not set
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y
# CONFIG_DMA_NONPCI is not set
