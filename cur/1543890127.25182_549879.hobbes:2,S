What exactly do you want to know, and why do you care?
The idea is that every "struct block_device" supports barriers.  If the
underlying hardware doesn't support them directly, then they get
simulated by draining the queue and issuing a flush.
Theoretically there could be devices which have a write-back cache
that cannot be flushed, and you couldn't implement barriers on such a
device.  So throw it out and buy another?
As far as I can tell, the only thing XFS does differently with devices
that don't support barriers is that it prints a warning message to the
kernel logs.  If the underlying device printed the message when it
detected that barriers couldn't be supported, XFS wouldn't need to
care at all.
