	That makes sense.  It doesn't seem right that it gets called 
recursive in the first place.  I'm not sure, however, if the tunnel 
code can help it as it uses ip_output to send packets.

I've downloaded .23-rc1-rt0.  It appears the issue remains in both places
as seen below:
net/core/dev.c:  dev_queue_xmit
#ifdef CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT
		if (1) {
#else
		int cpu = raw_smp_processor_id(); /* ok because BHs are off */
		if (dev->xmit_lock_owner != cpu) {
#endif
and net/sched/sch_generic.c: qdisc_restart
#ifdef CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT
		netif_tx_lock(dev);
#else
		if (netif_tx_trylock(dev))
			/* Another CPU grabbed the driver tx lock */
			return handle_dev_cpu_collision(skb, dev, q);
#endif

ah ... i think i did it like that because i didnt realize that there 
would be a recursive call sequence, i was concentrating on recursive 
locking.
incidentally, this code got cleaned up in .23-rc1-rt0, and now it looks 
quite similar to your suggested fix. Could you double-check that it 
solves your problem?
