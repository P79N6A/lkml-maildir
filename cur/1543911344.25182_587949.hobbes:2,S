well that's another hunk of code for us to maintain and to slow all our
computers down.
It is quite unobvious to me that the whole pie-randomization thing is
worth merging.  Why shouldn't we just drop the lot?
<looks at the changelog>
  This patch is using mmap()'s randomization functionality in such a way
  that it maps the main executable of (specially compiled/linked
  -pie/-fpie) ET_DYN binaries onto a random address (in cases in which
  mmap() is allowed to perform a randomization).
  The code has been extraced from Ingo's exec-shield patch
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/exec-shield/
that certainly doesn't tell anyone why we should merge this code into Linux.
