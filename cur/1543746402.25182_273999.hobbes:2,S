Subject: [PATCH] fix weird placement of inline and static keywords in sctp.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/23/311

Here's a patch that moves the keywords  inline  and  static  to the 
beginning of the declaration for a few functions in sctp.h
This has no impact on functionality and is completely safe, the only 
bennefit is less cluttered output from the compiler when building with 
gcc -W .  This is nice for people like me who build with -W to find 
potential troublespots to review (the less warnings to sift through the 
better). I can find no argument against fixing this.
This patch elliminates a whole bunch of 
include/net/sctp/sctp.h:610: warning: `static' is not at beginning of declaration
include/net/sctp/sctp.h:610: warning: `inline' is not at beginning of declaration
include/net/sctp/sctp.h:617: warning: `static' is not at beginning of declaration
include/net/sctp/sctp.h:617: warning: `inline' is not at beginning of declaration
include/net/sctp/sctp.h:625: warning: `static' is not at beginning of declaration
include/net/sctp/sctp.h:625: warning: `inline' is not at beginning of declaration
when building with -W
Please consider applying.
