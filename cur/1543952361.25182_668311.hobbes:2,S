Yeah, and firefox scrolling is in the class of workloads where they
adaptively reduce CPU consumption as they get less quota (ie. because
they just start skipping).
Still, for desktop workloads you shouldn't have to deal with lots of
CPU hog processes on the runqueue, so I don't see why this is needed?
I don't mind having the timeslice smallish, but it shouldn't be
reduced as load increases.

Yeah, thanks for looking at that. Wow, scheduler patches sure make
it upstream a lot quicker than when I used to work on the damn thing ;)
I did a quick run and it seems like the postgresql overload problem is
far better if not solved now on my 2x quad core. Haven't had time to
get some reportable results, but I hope to.
