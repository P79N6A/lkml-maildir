Marcelo saw a 30% speed increase from 2.4.4 to 2.4.5pre3
on several tests.
At the moment the main issues left seem to be:
- balancing the inode + dentry caches versus the rest of
  the memory users  (I'm working on it now)
- simplifying __alloc_pages() a bit  (I've got some things
  ready but I'm waiting for some other people who say they
  also have some stuff to add)
- making sure we get rid of all the highmem flushing
  deadlocks ... there may still be a few around (ben, marcelo?)
regards,
Rik
