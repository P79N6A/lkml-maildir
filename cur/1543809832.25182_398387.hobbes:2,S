We need to preserve CRTSCTS off = no modem control activity - I'm
sure things like old serial mice do not take kindly to having the
modem control lines changing state, especially the ones they use to
power themselves.
Also, !CRTSCTS is most likely the state used by any existing userspace
RS485 implementations which would be using TIOCMBIC/TIOCMBIS to
manipulate the RTS signal, so having RTS manipulated in this state
would be an undesirable change of behaviour.
Hence, I'm very much in favour of having the default flow control
method to preserve in as many ways as possible existing behaviour
for CRTSCTS.
