Thanks for pointing this out.  I'll get you a patch in the next day or
two.  As you can probably tell, the code is just trying to decide
whether to use GFP_ATOMIC or GFP_KERNEL to allocate a couple of
things, depending on what context we're being called from.  So at
worst we can just change to GFP_ATOMIC unconditionally.
I'll check into whether we can do something cleverer, but just going
the GFP_ATOMIC route won't be horrible.
Thanks,
  Roland
