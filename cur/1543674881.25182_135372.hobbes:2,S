Thats the problem - you can't. You have to link the ide core code into one
file, which itself is easy (now I've fixed the pdc4030 in my tree) except
fo the cmd640 vlb hooks which are nasty as it sucks in a driver from a sub
directory.
That one is the remaining horror and I'm not sure how best to tackle it
