FWIW, I reported a one-line fix to Richard Henderson in
modutils-2.1.current regarding overstatement of the module code size by one
longword for 2.0 kernels.  This results in invalid paging requests in said
kernels when loading modules whose actual code size ends right next to (or
on) a page boundary (eg, the extra 4 bytes crosses a page boundary).
