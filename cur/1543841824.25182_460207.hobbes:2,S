I could do with those lines, but I believe there was enough information
printed to determine why it failed to boot. I've attached a patch that
should boot the machine and assuming it works, I just need the output of
dmesg.

Not suprising considering what the min_free_kbytes is from this output!

I believe it is because memmap was calculated to be bigger than it
possibly could be. Can you try booting the following patch with
loglevel=8 and send me the dmesg output if it boots please? Thanks
