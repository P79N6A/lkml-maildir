Right - depends what you're doing. You can look at irq balance (in 2.5 
or 2.4-ac), but I don't like it as a solution much. Or you could try 
programming the TPR (were some patches floating around). Would be interesting
to get some perf measurments against people using the TPR patches (is more
expensive to set on a P4). Or someone from Intel posted some code recently
that seemed to do more intelligent things, but I haven't had the time to
look closely. If you want to experiment with that, I'm sure people would
be interested in the results.

P3's aren't as brain damaged.
