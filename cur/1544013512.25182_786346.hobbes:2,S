Hi all,
I'm having a recurring problem with XFS which started about a day ago.  All of 
a sudden when reading a certain part of the disk (not sure where, but my 
nightly backups trigger it) I get an infinite loop of these messages appearing 
in my logs:
xfs_da_do_buf: bno 8388608
dir: inode 3087268096
Filesystem "md0": XFS internal error xfs_da_do_buf(1) at line 2015 of file

It doesn't seem to interfere with filesystem use, but metalog is logging 
thousands of these messages into the system log files (the log files grow at 
about 1MB/minute.)
Does anyone know what this error means?  Do I need to reformat the filesystem?
I've restarted a few times and the error goes away until the next nightly 
backup triggers it again.  Killing metalog does seem to stop the messages, so 
perhaps one of the log files is the culprit?  I'm not sure how to map that 
inode or bno back to a filename.  It's always the same bno/inode and always 
reports metalog as the offending program.
Any suggestions how to go about diagnosing this problem?
Many thanks,
Adam.
