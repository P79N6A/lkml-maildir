Hello!
  I have 98M in  my computer, but my motherboard can  only cache 64M. If
I enable the full 98M, my computer is slower sometimes.
  How can I separate the upper 32M from the other 64M?
  How  can  I  use  THAT  space for  disk-cache,  swap-space,  or  other
things?
  I heard  that there are  some patches for  this. Can somebody  give an
URL for this?
  Thanks in advance...
