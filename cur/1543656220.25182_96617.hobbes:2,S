Just subscribe to the bk-commits-head mailing list, and then have
procmail set up a filter to alert you to anything that happens to files
in any specific directories.
Or do something else with the data sent on that mailing list, or look at
the changeset files on kernel.org that are constantly being generated.
There are lots of ways to get this information without relying on hooks
in bk.
Hope this helps,
