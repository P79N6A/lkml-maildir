disable_irq is expensive but disable_irq_nosync is quite fast as it
complete even if there are other irq running at the same time.

If you need to grab the spinlock for a rasonable time then the best is to
disable_irq_nosync and then grab the spinlock as 3c509 does, so you won't
harm irq latency and you'll scale equally well as a local cli on SMP.
