Dunno,  but we also see (every now and then) that Verizon
system rejects emails towards it with MAIL FROM giving
vger.kernel.org  domain.
Reading deeper, the visible "To:" header, and "remote mta"
line do say:   vgr.kernel.org   which isn't quite exactly right...
Perhaps you should ask from the given  <postmaster@verizon.net>
contact address for assistance ?  (And do send them the full
version, not just this abridged one.)
From the symptoms I do suspect that Verizon's DNS server(s) are
malfunctioning somehow.
An alternate is that their MTA software is treating temporary DNS
failures (like lookup timeout) as instantly permanent failures and
as a valid reason for reject, which would be a mad thing to do.
I have seen even that to happen before, although mainly with SMTP-
receivers, that report 500-series codes even for DNS timeouts.
In that protocol there are also 400-series codes, that are supposed
to be used in these "I can't find out now, do retry LATTER."
