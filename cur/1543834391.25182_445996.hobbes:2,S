GAAH!!
What kind of _crap_ is this cpufreq thing?
Lookie here:
	S06cpuspeed   D DD94A324  2180 10241  10215                     (NOTLB)

where it takes the cpu_hotplug lock in "store_scaling_governor()", and 
then calls __cpufreq_set_policy(), and then that ondemand thing WILL TAKE 
IT AGAIN!
What a piece of crap. Why, why, why?
[ Linus bangs his head against the wall until tears of blood course down 
  his face ]
I will here-by re-introduce the recursion thing for lock_cpu_hotplug, but 
I will make it say some very rude things about idiots who create code like 
this. 
cpufreq (or at least ondemand) must DIE! And the people who wrote that 
crap should have red-hot pokers jammed into some very uncomfortable 
places.
