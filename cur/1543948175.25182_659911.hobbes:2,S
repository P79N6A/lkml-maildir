This could be caused by the fact that as far as I know, X are not using 
kernel-autorepeat, but they are handling it themselves, right? So if their 
sense of time (probably due to some change of kernel timekeeping) gets 
wrong, the autorepeat in X might also get wrong.
It would be nice to know if when you hit the situation when autorepeat 
goes strange in X, if it is still OK in console.
