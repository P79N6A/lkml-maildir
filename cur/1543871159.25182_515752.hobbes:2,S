Obviously kbuild can be better and if someone are committed to put in
a month work on kbuild we would see improvements.
As the kbuild maintainer I am the first to agree on this.
kbuild has taken the direction where make is used not only
as a simple DAG tool - be some of the other facilities
has been utilised to support some of the following goals:
-> Very simple Kbuild files for the simple cases - and the simple cases counts
   for more than 95% of the Kbuild files in the kernel.
-> One kbuild file pr. directory for simplicity
-> rebuild in case prerequisites OR referred CONFIG symbol changes
-> rebuild if commandline arguments changes (but not order of these)
-> revert back to known Makefile syntax for complex scenarios
-> make kbuild infrastructure avialable for external modules to make build
   of these more releiable (pick up correct CONFIG)
-> Last but not least - relaible.
These golas are fulfilled by kbuild today.
You want to add another few goals:
-> Do not rely on GNU Make
-> Track actual timestamp/file content to support ClarCase dynamic views

If you try to use Kbuild in a way it is not designed to be used
then you will obviously face issues.
One Kbuild file pr. directory.
Use a top-level Kbuild file to specify both sub-directory Kbuild files.
This structure works well for the kernel - so it should work well for your module too?
I am open for specific improvement proposals - but not for 'redo from scratch proposals'.
