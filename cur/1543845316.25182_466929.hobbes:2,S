The way we deal with code which blindly pokes at legacy I/O addresses on
PowerPC is to have a check_legacy_ioport() function which will tell you
if it's safe to poke at the address in question. Perhaps that should be
extended to other architectures (some can just #define it to 0) and used
in the IDE code.
