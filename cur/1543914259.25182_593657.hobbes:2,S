Being rpm ignorant I do not know what the expected content of a kernel-source RPM
are but this is the available targets for kernel packaging (from make help):
Kernel packaging:
  rpm-pkg         - Build the kernel as an RPM package
  binrpm-pkg      - Build an rpm package containing the compiled kernel
                    and modules
  deb-pkg         - Build the kernel as an deb package
  tar-pkg         - Build the kernel as an uncompressed tarball
  targz-pkg       - Build the kernel as a gzip compressed tarball
  tarbz2-pkg      - Build the kernel as a bzip2 compressed tarball
I just tried binrpm-pkg - but alas I have no rpm installed it failed.
