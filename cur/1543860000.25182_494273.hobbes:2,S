> Thanks Jean. Your compressed/head.o looks fine.
No it doesn't -- the .text.head section doesn't have
the ALLOC attribute set.  The section then ends up not
being assigned to an output segment (during the linking
of vmlinux) and all hell breaks loose.  The linker gives
you a warning about this btw.
Jean, how old is your binutils?
Since 2.15 at least this should be set automatically
on sections named .text.<whatever> .
It wouldn't hurt to specify it by hand in the source
code of course -- change
.section ".text.head"
to
.section ".text.head","ax",@progbits
in compressed/head.S .
