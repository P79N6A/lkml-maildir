It sounds as if you have set your mouse up as the wrong type. Erratic
movement is generally caused by setting a Microsoft mouse up as a Mouse
Systems Mouse (MSM) or vice versa. Have you tried flicking the
switch under the mouse?
No switch? Many switchless mice can be put in MSM mode by holding the
left (sometimes right) mouse button while booting. Ie hold it till you get
the login screen in Linux. 
If doing this fixes your problem then you have your mouse in
Microsftmode. If you have no switch set the mouse up as Microsoft else
hold the button down everytime you reboot.
Oh if you are using the 2.2.x kernel range you should be using ttyS0
instead of cua0 - it will still work though.
Still got problems? Give more details on what mouse you have & what mode
it's in.
Cheers,
