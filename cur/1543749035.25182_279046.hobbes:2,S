I'm running plain 2.6.9 plus the patch you sent now.
So far, the server hasn't hosed itself (and it's been running for almost
half an hour - woohoo)
Now I can check out CVS trees without getting files with weird ownership
and undeletable directories  (which as *extremely* common before - in
fact, earlier today before I applied the patch, I was unable to complete
a cvs checkout of a moderately large software project).
I guess this is a thumbs up for your patch so far  :)

I have seen problems that your patch probably won't fix (like
undeletable directories randomly occuring on ext3 filesystems as well -
seems that once the dcache gets confused, it *really* gets confused).
Let's see how the box fares with your patch - I'll report back on new
bugs as I find them.
