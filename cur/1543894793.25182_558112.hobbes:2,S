What they said!!!
There are a couple of other options, however:
1.	Use preempt_disable() and preempt_enable() on the read side,
	and synchronize_sched() on the update side.
2.	Use local_irq_save() and local_irq_restore() on the read side,
	and synchronize_sched() on the update side.  Usually not
	competitive -- unless interrupts needed to be disabled for some
	other reason anyway.  Which you in fact say that you do.
I believe that #2 might do what you want.  But please, PLEASE carefully
comment this usage!!!
							Thanx, Paul
