timer->it.cpu.task is set to NULL by posix_cpu_timers_exit(), so the
code in posix_cpu_timer_del returns before accessing tasklist_lock.
The exit functions do not take any locks, but it is not necessary
there. 
posix_run_cpu_timers(p) is called with p=current() and we have
interrupts disabled, so the timer interrupt can not run on this CPU. The
current exiting process can not run at the same time on a different CPU,
so no race and lockup possible here.
