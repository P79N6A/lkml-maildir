Whatever it was, it's in a final Ubuntu dist and the trip point
interface
could help some people to still be able to use it.
ACPI is very machine specific. 100 machines may work well and QA might
oversee the 100 and first where critical shutdowns or whatever happens.
Such workarounds are really helpful then.
Same for ignore _PPC and thermal polling (the latter is always on in our
distro,
I bet a lot machine would break if disabling it and just ripping out the
ability to set it, is really not a solution).
One big challenge in the ACPI subsystem (kernel or userspace) is to find
out BIOS implemenations that are at the limit of specs or which violate
the
specs and try to workaround them.
We are not in the position of M$ (at least in the desktop/laptop
segment) yet.
BIOS developers won't follow our implementations and IMO we should go
the
other way and provide more workarounds. If nobody needs them, the
better.

Yes, it's not correct and those trip points might get overridden by BIOS
again on some machines. It still could help and doesn't hurt (Ok, one
should
not increase the critical trip point, but that can be implemented...).
Again, pls go for more workarounds.
The most annoying situation for the developer and the user is after
investing
a lot of time, finding and possibly fixing a bug and then you need to
tell the guy:
  - Got it, please wait for the next kernel release coming out in some
weeks/months
  - Thanks for the work, but implementing it in the kernel of this ditro
version
    is too dangerous. Other machines might break (especially with ACPI
bugs). Better
    you wait for the next distro version coming out in half a year.
