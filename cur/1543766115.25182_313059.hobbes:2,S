Thanks, I forgot about the guarantee of "at least" the time requested.
I took this on because I noticed this in a driver I wrote. With the user
passing in a timeval for a periodic condition. I noticed that this would
drift quite a bit. I guess I need to write my own timeval_to_jiffies
conversion so that i remove the added jiffy. For this case, I actually
want a true rounded value to the closest jiffy.
Thanks again,
