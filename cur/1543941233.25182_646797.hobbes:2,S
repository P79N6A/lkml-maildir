This patchkit implements support for the 1GB pages of AMD Fam10h CPUs 
in the kernel direct mapping. 
Change to previous versions:
- Incorporated feedback from Thomas Gleixner
- Switch direct mapping setup over to set_pte() / pte_pfn()
- Split up patches some more
Includes one not strictly required cleanup patch now (the last one) 
I believe this patchkit is ready for the 2.6.25 merge.
