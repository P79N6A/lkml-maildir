eg. with 16,000 threads in /proc, "ls /proc" is still fast:
     real:0m0.032s   user:0m0.007s   sys:0m0.024s
without those threads, it's:
     real:0m0.014s user:0m0.004s sys:0m0.010s
15 msecs difference. Even simple 'ls' reads the full /proc directory (all
16K+ entries). So performance-wise there's not a big difference.
architecture-wise there is a difference, and i'd be the last one arguing
against a tree-based approach to thread groups. It's much easier to find
threads belonging to a single 'process' via /proc this way - although no
functionality in procps has or requires such a feature currently.
