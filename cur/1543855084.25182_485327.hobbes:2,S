yes, once per active node.

It is, but this late in the cycle, I was going for the
obviously-correct-and-will-definitly-work solution.
It would be sufficient to call sort_node_map() in
find_min_pfn_with_active_regions() but I wasn't sure someone would call
find_min_pfn_for_node() at some future time causing another fun bug.
A slightly smarter, but not quite as obviously correct, patch is below if
you prefer it. It removes the assumption about early_node_map being sorted
for find_min_pfns and friends by always searching the whole map.  The map
is then only sorted once when it is required. Andre, I'd appreciate it if
you could give it a spin to be 100% sure it's ok. It passed a boot-test on
a few machines here.
===========
find_min_pfn_for_node() and find_min_pfn_with_active_regions() both
depend on a sorted  early_node_map[] to find the correct values. However,
sort_node_map() is being called after fin_min_pfn_with_active_regions()
in free_area_init_nodes(). In most cases, this is ok, but on an x86_64,
the SRAT table caused the E820 ranges to be registered out of order. This gave
the wrong values for the min PFN range resulting in some pages not being
initialised.
This patch works by always searching the whole early_node_map[] in
find_min_pfn_for_node().
