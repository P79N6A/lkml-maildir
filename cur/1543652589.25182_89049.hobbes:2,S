I made many tryes, and I taken for u 6 (I hope) significant tests
2.4.19 whith pdc drivers with and without softwer raid
2.5.46 whith pdc drivers with and without softwer raid
2.4.19 whith ataraid drivers with and without pdc drivers
all these tests issue the same problem.
For each try I have kernel config file and dmesg output and they are very
much text, so I think it isn't a good thig send all to u, tell me in
which u are interested and I'll send them.
If u think I can make a more usefull test, tell me about it.
Thank you again,
Daniele.
