And if you then umount the ramfs you just pivoted, the kernel locks hard.
That was a bug.
What you're looking for is switch_root, which has variants buried in klib, or 
in the current CVS version of busybox, or glued into Red Hat's weird little 
multi-function ramdisk shell, and probably a few other places by now.
Rather than unmounting rootfs, it deletes everything out of it to free up the 
space.  (It basically does the functional equivalent of "find / -xdev | xargs 
rm -rf", overmounts the old root with the new root, does a chroot, and execs 
the new init out of the new root.  Actually getting it right's a bit tricky, 
of course.  I still need to test the busybox version a whole lot more.  It's 
on my to-do list...)
