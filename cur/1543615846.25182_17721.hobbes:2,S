I have just wiped my LKML folder in my mail client to free up some space, so I'm
afraid I haven't read the beginning of your thread.  Dunno if this will help but
I have 384MB of RAM and I _don't have_ a swap partition.  Hence I don't have any
problem with swap.  I've never had my machine start the OOM killer either, and I
quite often run Win2k under vmware (using 128MB of that 384), while running
Gnome/Nautilus (bloatware)/XMMS/xchat/Galeon/StarOffice (bloatware).  Maybe you
push your machine harder than I do, but I've never actually needed swap on this
box...  No doubt someone will tell me I'm crazy, but I'm not about to waste at
least 384*2 MB of hdd space for something that my machine doesn't seem to
need.
[You may need to tell your distro to ignore the fact you don't have any swap,
I've had to add a #Please, no swap line to the bottom of my /etc/fstab for MDK
8.1 or it continues to warn me.  The damned RH installer won't let you install
without any swap (or am I missing a secret flag?).]
Joe.
