For what it is worth I too have seen this problem this morning and it
DOES appear to be new (in contrast to a previous comment)
The message:  pnpacpi: exceeded the max number of mem resources: 12
is displayed each time the system is booted with the 2.6.24-rc3-git5
kernel but is NOT displayed when booting 2.6.24-rc3-git4
I have made no changes in my config file between these two kernels other
than to accept any new defaults when running make oldconfig.
If you had already narrowed it down to a change between git4 and git5 I
apologize for wasting your time.  Have to run to work now.
Chris
