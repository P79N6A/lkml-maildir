Eh, its an easy enough change, so I'll put it back to u64. We can
revisit it again later if needed. 
However making sure periodic_hook isn't starved for too long is
important for good timekeeping, since ntp and cpufreq adjustments are
made at that point. Steven's suggestion of moving it to use ktimers
sounds like a good plan, but let me know if you can see any other holes.
