Hi Andi,
Sorry I keep telling you I'll work on this, but I never get
around to it. Mostly lack of hardware makes it difficult. I've
fixed a few bugs and some other workloads, so I keep hoping
that they will fix your problem :P
Your STREAM performance is really bad and I hope you don't
think I'm going to ignore it even if it is a bit stupid. Give
me a bit more time.
Of course, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with
sched-domains that is causing your problem. It can easily do
anything the old numa scheduler can do. It must be a bug or
some bad tuning somewhere.
