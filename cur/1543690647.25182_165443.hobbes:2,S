You probably have SMART disabled on those drives by BIOS, and smartd is
not smart enough to enable it before trying to use it so the drives
complain.  I had the same problem on my GigaByte mobo where the BIOS
setup didn't even provide an option to turn SMART on (like earlier Award
BIOSes did).
Check with smartctl -i /dev/hdX.  Enable with smartctl -e /dev/hdX
_before_ starting smartd.
Sorry for OT.
