  ummmm...  This isn't good.  I did this a few times until it bit me.  At
some point there are files generated... (make dep).  Some of these files
were used by things such as OSS sound drivers and pcmcia utilities to
make modules.  The files weren't being over written when I did the make
bzImage.  It appears they were being appended to.  As a result when other
modules were built on the dependency files I was getting "invalid kernel
symbols" and such.
