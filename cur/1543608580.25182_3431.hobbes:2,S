Yes, true, 2.6 seconds for the statm_pgd_range vs 1.2 for sprintf.  Still, 
sprintf is definitely burning cycles, pretty much the whole 1.2 seconds would 
be recovered with a binary interface.
Now look at the total time we spend in the kernel: 10.4 seconds, 4 times the 
page scanning overhead.  This is really wasteful.
For top does it really matter?  (yes, think slow computer)  What happens when 
proc stabilizes and applications start relying on it heavily as a kernel 
interface?  If we're still turning in this kind of stunningly poor 
performance, it won't be nice.
It's not that it doesn't work, it's just that it isn't the best.
