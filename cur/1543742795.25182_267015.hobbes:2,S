Hi Tom.
Finally took a look.
The best approach is to grab a copy of the .c file and compile
that in this dir.
In this way we avoid unessesary recompile etc. but waste a bit disk space.
I do not like symlinks in general and made a copy. (note: uses cat to give
appropriate permission)
If you are OK with this let me know if you want me to push it to linus
or you go via the ppc tree.
PS: Had troubles with kbd so commented out.
