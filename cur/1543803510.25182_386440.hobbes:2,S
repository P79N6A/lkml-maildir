I am currently working on improving the udftools package in ubuntu to 
make it actually usable.  In its current state it is only suitable for 
experimentation.  See the thread titled "[PATCH] pktcdvd & udf bugfixes" 
on this mailing list for more information.
Eject works fine for me though so I'm not sure what the problem is.  You 
might want to try using the stock 2.6.12 breezy kernel on your breezy 
install, instead of your home built 2.6.15-mm kernel.  I'm running the 
stock 2.6.15 kernel on my dapper install and eject works just fine once 
unmounted.
If you feel like building the package and testing it, it's up on REVU 
right now at 
http://revu.tauware.de/details.py?upid=1433
That contains a few bug fixes discussed in the other thread I refered 
you to.  I am still trying to get the package integrated with hal so 
it's all plug and play automagic, but running into some trouble there.
