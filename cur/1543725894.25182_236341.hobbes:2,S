Even more amazed...
Fruhwirth, what you have failed to understand is that the exploit does does
not exploit flaws in any cipher, but cryptoloop's and dm-crypt's insecure
use of those ciphers. Any block cipher that encrypts two identical plaintext
blocks using same key and produces two identical ciphertext blocks will do.
It is all about tricking a cipher to encrypt two identical plaintext blocks,
which, after encryption will show up as two identical ciptext blocks. And
those identical ciphertext blocks can be easily detected and counted.
