This looks bogus.
Current directory is $(objtree) so prefixing with $(objtree) should not
be needed and doing so will confuse make. make will not know that
$(objtree)/include/linux/version.h and include/linux/version.h is the
same file.
And the version.h dependency is anyway not needed. kbuild guarantee the
version.h is created when the commands for archprepare are executed.
So for sh I would expect the following is a better fix:
diff --git a/arch/sh/Makefile b/arch/sh/Makefile
index e467a45..ed1c865 100644
--- a/arch/sh/Makefile

 all: zImage
arm should have a similar fix - thats the only other archtecture that
reference version.h in the arch specific kbuild (Makefile) files.

Have not seen the reports - may have overlookd them at lkml.
Been on vacation a few days so ctrl-d was used to read most of my
lkml mails.
