Actually, do we really need that delay as we are waiting for an
interrupt anyway ? my understanding is that this delay is the required
before we start polling for BSY bit (that is the max time the drive may
take to assert BSY after getting the command), but in our case, unless
we have other bugs, we shall have the channel marked busy, so nobody
will tap it, except the actual interrupt coming in. Or will the case of
shared interrupt potentially cause a read of status at the wrong time ?
