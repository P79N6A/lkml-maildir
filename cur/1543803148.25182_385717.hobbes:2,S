I didn't mean to imply that they're mutually exclusive, and after doing 
some testing, I concluded that it (or something like it) is definitely 
still needed.  The version that's in mm2 _is_ buggy however, so ripping it 
back out wouldn't hurt my delicate little feelings one bit.  In fact, it 
would give me some more time to instrument and test integration with your 
changes.  (Which I think are good btw because they remove what I considered 
to be warts; the pipe and uninterruptible sleep barriers.  Um... try irman2 
now... pure evilness)
