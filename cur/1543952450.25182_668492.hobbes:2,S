Subject: [patch 00/11] mount ownership and unprivileged mount syscall (v9)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Andrew, Al,
Please consider adding this series to your trees.
I've been using these patches for a while on my laptop to mount fuse
filesystems as user, without any suid-root helpers.  The setup is as
follows:
- link /proc/mounts to /etc/mtab
- patch util-linux-ng with 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/16/103
- remove suid from mount, umount and fusermount
- add a line to /etc/fstab to bind mount ~/mnt onto itself owned by the user
- add 'fs.types.fuse.usermount_safe = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf
Apart from '/dev/sda2' being replaced with '/dev/root' in 'mount' and
'df' outputs, I haven't experienced any problems.
Thanks,
Miklos
v8 -> v9
 - new patch: copy mount ownership when cloning the mount namespace
v7 -> v8
 - extend documentation of allow_usermount sysctl tunable
 - describe new unprivileged mounting in fuse.txt
v6 -> v7:
 - add '/proc/sys/fs/types/<type>/usermount_safe' tunable (new patch)
 - do not make FUSE safe by default, describe possible problems
   associated with unprivileged FUSE mounts in patch header
 - return EMFILE instead of EPERM, if maximum user mount count is exceeded
 - rename option 'nomnt' -> 'nosubmnt'
 - clean up error propagation in dup_mnt_ns
 - update util-linux-ng patch
v5 -> v6:
 - update to latest -mm
 - preliminary util-linux-ng support (will post right after this series)
v4 -> v5:
 - fold back Andrew's changes
 - fold back my update patch:
    o use fsuid instead of ruid
    o allow forced unpriv. unmounts for "safe" filesystems
    o allow mounting over special files, but not over symlinks
    o set nosuid and nodev based on lack of specific capability
 - patch header updates
 - new patch: on propagation inherit owner from parent
 - new patch: add "no submounts" mount flag
v3 -> v4:
 - simplify interface as much as possible, now only a single option
   ("user=UID") is used to control everything
 - no longer allow/deny mounting based on file/directory permissions,
   that approach does not always make sense
v1 -> v3:
 - add mount flags to set/clear mnt_flags individually
 - add "usermnt" mount flag.  If it is set, then allow unprivileged
   submounts under this mount
 - make max number of user mounts default to 1024, since now the
   usermnt flag will prevent user mounts by default
