It's not specifically related to FC3.  It's udev - we've broken _any_
distribution which uses a two-year-old udev.  In fact we're proposing
breaking any distro which has an older-than-ten-month udev.  That's really
bad.
It's worse on FC3 because there is, as far as I can tell, no rpm or srpm
which can be used to unbreak it.  And pointing at Documentation/Changes
doesn't alter that, does it?
Personally, there's no way I'm upgrading this box because I _want_ to run
old distros to catch things like this.  So I'll hack it around to work
somehow.  I can do that, because I'm a developer. 
Are we going to stop doing this soon?
