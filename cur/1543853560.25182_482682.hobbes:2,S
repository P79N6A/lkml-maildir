yeah. I was thinking about the low 16 irqs (those are really the problem 
spots most of the time, not the normal IO-APIC irqs) - which are routed 
all across the southbridge and might end up being handled by a 
i8259A-lookalike entity. Right now we default to level-triggered IRQ 
flow handling:
                if (i < 16) {
                        /*
                         * 16 old-style INTA-cycle interrupts:
                         */
                        set_irq_chip_and_handler_name(i, &i8259A_chip,
                                                      handle_level_irq, "XT");
because that's the best we can do (it's also what our i8259 code did 
historically). But it would be one step safer to also do the 
lazy-disable. Just in case things might get lost while masked. Or is 
that an absolutely horrible hardware breakage that i shouldnt worry 
about?

ok, i'm fine with Eric's patch too, if it solves Komuro's problem:
  Acked-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
and we dont have to worry about the present ugliness of the 
delayed-disabled flag either, as it would just go away in 2.6.20.
