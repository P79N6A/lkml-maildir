There's something wrong with your gcc installation. It has nothing to do
with the kernel compilation perse.
stdarg.h is a part of the headers that are specific to each gcc version.
You'll normally find it somewhere below /usr/lib/gcc-lib.
Perhaps something went wrong during installation of your gcc (a full
disk or so) or you moved some directory trees, causing gcc no longer to
find its include files. Some directories are hardcoded into the gcc
executable during its compilation. If you have to move some things (to
work around full partitions say) use symlinks.
Try reinstalling gcc.
