I think we can use 'stages' and pass them as arguments to the functions.
In that case we can have two callbacks for the hibernation (I'd prefer to say
'hibernation' instead of 'suspend to disk' from now on), one 'quiesce' callback
and one 'activate' callback that can be called many times in one
snapshot/restore cycle with different arguments, for example:
quiesce(PREPARE) -- that may be needed for drivers that allocate much memory
before quiescing devices (if any)
...
quiesce(PRE_SNAPSHOT)
...
quiesce(PRE_SNAPSHOT_IRQ_OFF)
...
activate(POST_SNAPSHOT_IRQ_OFF)
...
activate(POST_SNAPSHOT)
...
activate(FINISH)
etc.
Greetings,
Rafael
