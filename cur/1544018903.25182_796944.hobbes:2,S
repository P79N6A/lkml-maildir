Even in in-kernel solution, cgroup code will be compiled out if user
is not using IO controller. Some code might still be present in run time
but I don't think it will be any big run time penalty.

Agree that dm device is highly independent module but I think in this it
does not look like the right place to implement the  IO controller.
I think with the introduction of cgroup, IO scheduling has become now
a hierarhical scheduling. Previously it was flat scheduling where there
was only one level. Not there can be multiple levels and each level
can have groups and queues. I don't think that we can break down
hiearchical scheduling problem in two parts where top level part is moved
into a module. It is something like saying that lets break out cpu group
schedling into a separate module and it should not be part of kernel.
I think we need to implement this hiearchical IO scheduler in kernel which
can schedule groups as well as end level io queues. (maintained by cfq,
deadline, as, or noop).

Just because device mapper framework allows one to implement IO controller
in a separate module, we should not implement it there. It will be
difficult to take care of issues like, configuration, breaking underlying IO
scheduler's assumptions, capability to treat tasks and groups at same level
etc.

True that even limited availability of request descriptors can be a
bottleneck and can lead to same kind of issues but my contention is
that you are aggravating the problem. Putting a 2nd layer can break IO
scheduler's assumption even before underlying request queue is full.
So second level solution on top will increase the frequency of such
incidents where a lower priority task can run away with more job done than
high priority task because there are no separate queues for different
priority tasks and release of buffered bio is FIFO.
Secondly what happens to tasks of RT class? dm-ioband does not have any
notion of handling the RT cgroup or RT tasks.
Thirdly, doing any kind of resource control at higher level takes away the
capability to treat task and groups at same level. I have had this
discussion in other offline thread also where you are copied. I think
it is a good idea to treat tasks and groups at same level where possible
(depends if IO scheduler creates separate queues for tasks or not, cfq
does.)

I think this is not practical. What we are talking is that task
priority does not have any meaning. If we want service difference between
two tasks, we need to pack them in separate cgroup otherwise we can't
gurantee things. If we need to pack every task in separate cgroup then
why to even have the notion of task priority.

bio-cgroup patches are fine because they provide us the capability to 
map delayed writes to right cgroup. And it can be used by any IO
controller.

Can you elaborate on that please? We have heard in the past that cgroup 
does not give you enough flexibility but never got details.
In this case first you are forcing some functionalilty to go in a kernel
module and then coming up with tools for configuration. I never understood
that why don't you let the controller be inside the kernel, let it
directly interact with cgroup subsystem and work instead of first taking
the functionality out of kernel in a module and then justifying the case
that now we need new ways of configuring that module because cgroup
infrastructure is not sufficient.

Not everybody uses LVM. Balbir had asked once, if there are thousands of 
disks in the system, does that mean I need to create this dm-ioband device
for all the disks?

We do need hierarhical grouping facility for IO controller also.
I am not sure that I agree to the idea of implementing IO controller 
as a device mapper driver because device mapper framework allows it to
be implemented as a module and one can avoid putting code in kernel. At
this point of time, IMHO, I don't think that IO controller code living
inside the kernel is an issue. I would rather focus on rest of the issues.
