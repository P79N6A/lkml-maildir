And I suppose that a busy knfsd qualifies as an "allocator"   :)

Done!  Set to 3 now - I will let the box run with this setting until
tomorrow, and report back how things look.

I'm leaving this one be for now (one variable at a time). But let's see
what tomorrow brings. 
Judging from the code, it seems that it's the vm_vfs_scan_ratio that
directly affects the icache/dcache and dquot - but I'm sure that there
are subtle interactions far beyond what I can possibly hope to
comprehend ;)
Thanks a lot for your suggestions Marcelo!
