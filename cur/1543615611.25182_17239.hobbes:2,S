Actually it costs much more. For example Promise Ultra100TX2
costs about 54$ (so is is 27$ per channel). Ultra133TX2 is more expensive
- around 88$. It is more than half of TEKRAM DC-390U2W (Ultra2+Ultra
SCSI Adapter) with Symbios 53C895 chipset. Those are SRP prices with VAT
tax. Maybe prices in USA/Canada are much lower...
