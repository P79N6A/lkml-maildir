It is, although most x86-64 installations seem to be 64-bit user space 
*if*you*install*from*scatch*.
Of course, at least some users (yeah, I've done it) started with a 32-bit 
CD they had lying around, and upgraded just the kernel. And I'm sure some 
distro out there just defaults to 32-bit binaries just because (in 
practice, you have to use a 32-bit firefox anyway if you want flash etc, 
so you need all the 32-bit libraries, so the argument might go that you 
might as well use 32-bit stuff for all the common stuff, and only 64-bit 
binaries when actually needed).
