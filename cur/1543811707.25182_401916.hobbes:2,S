In -rc5 the printk timing numbers do not reset to [    0.000000] upon
boot. This worked in -rc4 and so I started bisecting and git came up
with:

	[PATCH] OOM kill: children accounting
I can't see why that would break the timing information, but I'll just
assume that git was right, and tell you guys.
My system is:
Linux sap 2.6.16-rc4 #1 PREEMPT Mon Feb 20 13:34:18 CET 2006 i686
Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.00GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
Let me know if more information is needed.
