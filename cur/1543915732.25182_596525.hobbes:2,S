not really ... this patch was posted before but was lost in the
shuffle ... and i'm not quite sure what you mean by "depends on" ...
if you want to use the FLAT file format on a Blackfin processor, then
this patch is needed, but that isnt the only file format that works on
the Blackfin port as we also have FDPIC ELF
i havent used FLAT files on a Blackfin board in quite a long time actually ...
