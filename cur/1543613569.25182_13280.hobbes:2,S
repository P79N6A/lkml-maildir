Perhaps the wording of CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM in Configure.help could be a bit
stronger;
Use SRM as bootloader
CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM
  There are two different types of booting firmware on Alphas: SRM,
  which is command line driven, and ARC, which uses menus and arrow
  keys. Details about the Linux/Alpha booting process are contained in
  the Linux/Alpha FAQ, accessible on the WWW from
  <
http://www.alphalinux.org/>.
  The usual way to load Linux on an Alpha machine is to use MILO
  (a bootloader that lets you pass command line parameters to the
  kernel just like lilo does for the x86 architecture) which can be
  loaded either from ARC or can be installed directly as a permanent
  firmware replacement from floppy (which requires changing a certain
  jumper on the motherboard). If you want to do either of these, say N
  here. If MILO doesn't work on your system (true for Jensen
  motherboards), you can bypass it altogether and boot Linux directly
  from an SRM console; say Y here in order to do that. Note that you
  won't be able to boot from an IDE disk using SRM.
  If unsure, say N.
Perhaps something like: 
If unsure, say N if you boot linux via MILO, or Y if you boot linux via
SRM.
I was fooled by this one also, and with the current text, I read it like
'saying N is safe'.
