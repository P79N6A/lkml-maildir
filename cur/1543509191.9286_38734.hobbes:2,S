There are two S3 Trio drivers in the kernel, neither of which you can
use (probably).  :(  The first, S3triofb, is for Open Firmware (PPC)
machines only.  The second, cyberfb, is for Amigas only.
Attached is a patch against 2.3.15 which adds PCI support to cyberfb. 
It still needs some debugging, as I haven't had time to work on it for a
few weeks now.  But, you can see the penguin at least.  Text on the
screen readable but garbled, so there is probably something wrong with
the fb_cmap color offsets or something like that.
When cyberfb is fixed, we can remove S3triofb from the kernel.  Longer
term, I am working to replace both cyberfb and S3triofb with 's3fb', to
be based on s3lib[1], a generic library which support all S3 chips from
Trio to the current Savage4.
Generic fbdev info:
There is a mailing list for kernel fbdev:
linux-fbdev@vuser.vu.union.edu  Send to majordomo@vuser.vu.union.edu to
subscribe.
There is also a mailing list for Linux S3 users (not very active
presently):  linux-s3@gtf.org  Send to majordomo@gtf.org to subscribe.
Finally, a page full of fbdev info for both users and kernel developers
exists at:
