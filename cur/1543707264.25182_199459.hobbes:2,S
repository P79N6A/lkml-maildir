I think I'm just making the mistake of assuming that anybody would care to 
do it "right", while everybody really only cares to get it be compatible 
with Windows.
For example, if you only want to be compatible with Windows, you don't 
have to worry about UCS-4, you only have the UCS-2 part, which means that 
you can do a silly array-lookup based thing or something.

Ugh. What a horrible kludge, and it won't work without "preparing" the 
filesystem at mount-time. I'd much rather leave the translation table in 
user space, and just give it as an argument to the "look up case 
insensitive" special thing.
That would mean that we can hold the directory semaphore over the whole 
thing, which would simplify _my_ kludge, since there would be no need to 
worry about user space having separate stages.
The hard part would be negative dentries. We'd have to invalidate all
"case-insensitive" negative dentries when creating any new file in a
directory, and that would be something the generic VFS layer would have to 
know about, and that might be unacceptable to Al.
