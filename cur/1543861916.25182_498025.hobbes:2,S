just FYI, the reason i brought this up in the first place is that i
noticed that the ALIGN() macro in kernel.h didn't verify that the
alignment value was a power of 2, so i thought -- hmmm, i wonder if
there are any invocations where that's not true, so i (temporarily)
rewrote ALIGN to incorporate that check, and the build blew up
including include/net/neighbour.h, which contains the out-of-function
declaration:
struct neighbour
{
        ...
        unsigned char           ha[ALIGN(MAX_ADDR_LEN, sizeof(unsigned long))];
        ...
so it's not a big deal, it was just me goofing around and breaking
things.
