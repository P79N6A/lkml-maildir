No, rfkill want to see keypresses, period. It does not care if there
are other applications also seeing the same keypresses, it just does
not want keypresses stolen from it.
Rfkill should work just fine if there is a debug application capturing
events or a OSD utility monitoring RF state. Actually it would be
great if amy of the control utililities were split in 2 parts - one is
daemon running even without X and controlling RF starte, brightness,
suspend, etc, etc, and another part running in X (or some other
environment) providing OSD services. I mean it is really annoying when
you realize you can't suspend witha keypress because you happen to be
a KDM promot and not fully logged into a KDE session...

Yes, applications need to decide whether they want to process certain
events or not. But I think that they shodul do it for themselves, not
for other applications. Otherwise dependencies are just insane and you
risk to disturb the peace just by adding another piece in the mix.
