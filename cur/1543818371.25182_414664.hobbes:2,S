I cetainly did. A simple `make oldconfig' ends up zapping pretty much
all the old iptables CONFIG_ options, so you end up with not much of
iptables or netfilter left.
I must admit not quite understanding why the xtables stuff is needed:
I thought that was needed for userspace connection tracking, which
while it sounds cool isn't something I'm using yet.
