Prolly, I'm not the expert on ARM26-linux, in fact I've never used it,
but IIRC all the ARM26 bit machines have 16MB[1], maximum memory size,
in the (chipset/MB) architecture. 
Although They  will not have less than 4MBytes and the memsize will be a
multiple of 4MBytes. I'm guessing here that multiple MEMCs with
different page sizes isn't going to work very well.
So I doubt that not enlarging page-cache size is a big issue.
[1]    I'm think of the 240/540 here so it's actually going to be 8MB in 
       most cases.
