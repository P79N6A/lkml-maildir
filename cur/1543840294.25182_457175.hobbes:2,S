She handles these.

thread #2 is reading data from a pipe which is at a secret level, so how
will it exploit that?  It can't write it to a lower integrity file...

The revoke(2) isn't quite right semantically, because it would revoke
all users' access, right?  Rather, we want one process' rights to all
files revoked, but other read/writers should still have access.
Certainly if it were implemented, I'd hope slim could share some of it's
code.
I did try another version of the revocation code which uses
change_protection() to remove the write access, then introduced a hook
on in front of page_mkwrite() to prevent making the page writeable
again.  But I was thinking only of integrity, so actually the secrecy
concerns would not be addressed.
