I'm basically observing the same thing - 5 drives connected alone on their own 
ata100 channels (1 on a Via southbridge, 4 on HPT370 channels).
I'm seing speeds 33, 44, 66 and 69 as when examining /proc/ide/hdx/settings. 
There are 2 differing types of drives, but all are ATA100 capable.
This is also with 2.4.18, originally slackware 7.1
