2.4 supports sparse lun scanning, although it is not enabled
dynamically and requires add a BLIST_SPARSELUN flag for your device
in the device_list array in drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c
You just need to get the Vendor and Model info from /proc/scsi/scsi
I am using qlogic 2300s with sparse luns working fine on 2.4.18.
