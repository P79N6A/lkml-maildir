Looks fine, except for the fact that nowhere did it say which kernel
version the patch was generated against. Which is often a rather important
clue ;)
Now if you automate this, I would suggest adding a section in between the
explanation and the patch: the "diffstat" output of the patch. It doesn't
matter much for this example, because obviously the patch is small enough
that just scrolling down shows what's up, but..
I would also suggest that whatever activates the patch asks for a
subject-line that is more than 12 characters long ;)
Also worthwhile for automation is an md5sum or similar (for verifying that
the mail made it though the mail system unscathed). A pgp signature would
be even better, of course - especially useful as I suspect it would be
good to also cc the things to some patch-list, and having a clear identity
on the sender is always a good idea in these things.
