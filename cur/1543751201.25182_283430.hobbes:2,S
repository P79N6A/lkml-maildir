Well that blows one of the theories I was looking at. :( -mm is carrying 
a patch that lengthens the cache_hot_time to roughly a ms instead of a 
usec, which could effect how fast tasks might be migrated to an idle cpu.

Do you have a simple way of triggering and trapping the starvation? That 
of course is probably asking for a lot. :)
