Shame on me, I missed that: 
int nwfs_mmap(struct file * file, struct vm_area_struct * vma)
{
    struct inode *inode = file->f_dentry->d_inode;
    if (vma->vm_flags & VM_SHARED)   // only PAGE_COW or read-only supported now
       return -EINVAL;
I guess supporting shared mappings would be useful though for a 
general purpose filesystem, because more and more programs use them. 
To fix it I think it is needed to implement unmap and sync 
vma operations that write the data to the file. 
That still has some problems over fully page cache integrated filesystems
like ext2 (user has to call msync to see updates in read/write and it is
slower), but would at least make them work.
