Search the MSDN Library for "Linux" (or even just "Unix") one of these  
days. There's a number of articles in there that essentially says (often  
hidden among other stuff) that this Linux/Unix stuff is very good and  
highly successfull, especially in the server market.
The non-marketers inside M$ seem to know this just fine.
(Oh, there's also the source to the Apache mod_frontpage in there, and it  
says that on Linux system user ids are 0-15 IIRC, whereas other unices  
have 0-11. I wonder how they got *that* idea?)
