yes, of course. Are you arguing that all debugging options should be 
made unconditional? Matt's patch simply makes double-fault-debugging 
optional. More than that, it will still be unconditionally enabled 
unless CONFIG_EMBEDDED is specified.

the dynamics of memory reduction patches is just like the dynamics of 
scalability patches: we have to attack on _every front_ and even then 
progress will appear to be very slow. We almost never reject a 
scalability micro-optimization just because there might be larger fruits 
hanging.

yeah. Still, i see no problem with making it optional. (as long as it 
does not result in significant uglification of the code - which clearly 
is not a problem for this particular patch.)
