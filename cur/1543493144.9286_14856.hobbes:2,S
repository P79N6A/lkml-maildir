Granted.  I don't feel strongly one way or the other.  I agree with
previous comments that Linux shouldn't have to fix problems with other
systems, but I'm also pragmatic. 
I haven't explored the kernel tcp code, so I didn't know how the
workarounds were implemented.  I was thinking that they might be clearly
separated and commented exceptions for broken implementations that could
be ifdef'd without a great deal of effort.  Apparently not.
If you had an Intranet without any misbehaving systems and no Internet
connection (!) or an isolated Beowulf cluster, leaving the workarounds out
would seem to be another appealing feature of a custom kernel.  Not that I
would expect a significant performance difference, but "significant" is
relative.
Might I note that the PC/TCP client workaround should not be in the
kernel configuration using your argument?  Apparently, workarounds are
made configurable on a case-by-case basis.  I expect the workarounds
themselves can create problems for well-behaved systems.
All of the above MHO from an end user - not kernel developer - viewpoint.
Thanks for the feedback (and the next gen filesystem development!).
