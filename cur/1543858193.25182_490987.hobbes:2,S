Hi, Roman & All:
In 2.6.19 (and Linus' curent tree), I found the following:
          libpath=$$dir/lib; lib=qt; osdir=""; \
          $(HOSTCXX) -print-multi-os-directory > /dev/null 2>&1 && \
            osdir=x$$($(HOSTCXX) -print-multi-os-directory); \
          test -d $$libpath/$$osdir && libpath=$$libpath/$$osdir; \
What does the little 'x' do in front of $$(foo)? It looks suspiciously
like a typo to me.
I think Jason caught it, but I didn't see a correction sent out.
