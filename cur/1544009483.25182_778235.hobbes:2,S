I found it a bit ugly too while I wrote it :-(
I like this idea of a section, I will just have to verify if it is
between the start and the end of
it to check if its an irq entry.
But I think that even if the others than do_IRQ and
smp_apic_timer_interrupt are more rare,
they should be annotated for this new section (and it seems there are
new coming interrupts
like smp_perf_counter_interrupt() in perf counter....)... Perhaps
someone would profile them...
Hm?
