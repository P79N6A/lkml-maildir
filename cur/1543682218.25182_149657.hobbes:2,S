I've told other people before and I'll tell you again:
Please, pretty please, leave linux-kernel for discussions about the
linux kernel and leave the bitkeeper flames for those that enjoy
electronic pyrotechnic.
Apart from that: Larry is right.  Noone cared about crappy ol' cvs
until bk came alone and showed what everyone already knew.  If you
didn't have to improve cvs back then, it is still as good as it was,
so thy improve it now?  Pure jealousy?
