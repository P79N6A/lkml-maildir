Hi folks,
I was recently booted from the list when my MX started bouncing email. I've
since resolved the situation with davem and resubscribed, but I'm missing
about a day or so worth of traffic. If someone would be willing to make an
mbox file covering November 14, 15, and whatever has come so far from today,
I'd very much appreciate it.
Many thanks!
Zack
