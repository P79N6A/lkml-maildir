Complete bollocks.  As long as the pte chains are consistent while
refill_inactive_zone holds pte_chain_lock (they darn well should be),
concurrent page_referenced() and page_convert_anon() is fine.
It could be that page_referenced() returns an inappropriate answer, but it's
so rare we don't care.
Which is good.  We really don't want to lock pages in refill_inactive_zone()
to keep the extremely rare page_convert_anon() away.  refill_inactive_zone()
is more a bath-temperature path than a hotpath, but still...
