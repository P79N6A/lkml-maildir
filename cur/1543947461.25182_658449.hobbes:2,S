Too time consuming on consumer drives with projects the size of Linux.

No, just commit the current unfinished work to a new branch and deal
with it later (cherry-pick, rebase, reset --soft, commit --amend -i,
you name it). Or if all else fails, use git-stash.
You do not have to push these temporary branches at all, so it is
much nicer than svn. (Once all the work is done and cleanly in
master, you can kill off all branches without having a record
of their previous existence.)

if I don't collect arbitrary changes, I don't need squashing
(see reset --soft/amend above)
