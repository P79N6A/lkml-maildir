Hi,
I've been reading about the advantages of the NPTL threads library but I
couldn't find the answers for some questions. The main doubt is related to
its advantages on SMP machines.
Many things have been made on the kernel to make the threads library
better, like the introduction of futexes, changes on the signal handling
mechanism, use of new architecture specific data structures, and so on. A
lot is said about the benefits of using the new threads implementations on
SMP machines. I'd like to know which changes have been made specifically
thinking on SMP machines, and which have been made to other purposes?
Is there any feature on the library/kernel that make it possible to
exploit the benefits of NUMA systems?
Thanks
William
