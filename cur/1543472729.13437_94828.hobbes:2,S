Could someone tell me if the problem with proxyarp in 2.1.131 and ppp
2.3.5 has been solved yet?  I was watching the discussions which were
taking place but never saw a resolution.  Anyway, for better or worse
I put 2.1.131 on a production machine and bingo my users ppp has gone
south.  Can you spell "upset?"  Sure you can.
