It may not *stay* unsupported, so I think changing it in either
of those permanent ways would be confusing/misleading.
For example, USB devices have multiple states ... minimally, an
unconfigured state, and a configured state.  Some have multiple
configurations.  Only configured states can be wakeup-capable.
So a given device might have three states, but support wakeup
except in one of them...
