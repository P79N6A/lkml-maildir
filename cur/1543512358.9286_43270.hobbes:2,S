I give you a scanario: An Origin 2000 can consist of upto 64 nodes
interconnected by a SAN.  The network can be subdivided into partitions
which basically then do behave like networked but indepent machines.
It would be neat if at runtime a node, that is CPU, memory, interrupt
and I/O resources, could be added / removed.  On the todo list, but not
the one for tomorrow :-)
