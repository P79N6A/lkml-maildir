I cannot predict how allocations on a slab will be performed. In order 
to avoid the higher order allocations in we would have to add a flag 
that tells SLUB at slab creation creation time that this cache will be 
used for atomic allocs and thus we can avoid configuring slabs in such a 
way that they use higher order allocs.
The other solution is not to use higher order allocations by dropping the 
antifrag patches in mm that allow SLUB to use higher order allocations. 
But then there would be no higher order allocations at all that would use 
the benefits of antifrag measures.
