I agree. We can create a file in userspace that the hotplug agent can 
query for what to name the device. It's gonna have to do this anyway, for 
user-defined policy. Putting the legacy name in that puts all names in 
one place.

Exactly. If we go with a text file, and we enforce our own 1 value/file 
semantics, we end up with a file for each:
- major
- minor
- type (char vs. block)
- legacy name
If we punt the legacy name to userspace, a device node becomes ideal for 
expressing the data.

I didn't even want it in the first place. ;) But, it's a lot easier to 
express the data /sbin/hotplug needs than three separate files. 
Also note that there may be multiple 'node' files (or equivalent) for 
devices that support multiple interfaces. E.g. mice in the input layer 
have an general event device and a mouse event device. The patch I posted 
wouldn't work, since the name is hardcoded to 'node'. But, it would be 
trival to append or prepend the name of the interface to 'node'. 
We could do that for each of the text files, but that would unnecessarily 
clutter the device's directory.
As far as abuse, we could force the permissions to 000, which would still 
allow us to stat the device. We appear to still do a request_module() on 
open(), but read() and write() should fail..
