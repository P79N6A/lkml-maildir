Subject: Sound problem w/es1371 driver - freeze & dma timed out message?

I just got a new Sound Blaster 128 PCI and unfortunately sndconfig
doesn't like it.  It detects the IRQ and I/O fine, but when it tries
to play a sample it freezes and the following is appended to dmesg:
es1371: dma timed out??
Any idea what this could be?  If I compile in the driver, I get the
same symptom.  This is kernel 2.2.13
Thanks!
Mark
