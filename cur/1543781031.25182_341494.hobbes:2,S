Dear Marc,
I have doubt about the driver?
I do NOT support the partitions in my driver. I mean I have implemented
it as alloc_disk(1) i.e. 0 partitions. 
Is this what is creating the HAVOC to mount my SD card? 
Do I need to support the partitions in my driver to support mounting SD
cards formatted in DIGITAL CAMERAS?(clarity needed)
I have an update on the CAM formatted SD. 
SECTOR-0 Description:
Bytes		0   		446
512		
Details	|-  MB code -| - partition + signature	 | 
					Table
I dumped the 1st sector of SD when formatted on 
	1) CAM &
	2) Windows
Yes, the partition table exists on both.
The only protruding difference I find is the Master Boot Code. Can you
comment on the Master Boot Code? 
I tried copying the windows SD first 446 bytes to CAM SD first 446
bytes.
I am able to mount but I am loosing the data.
I have attached the files. Please have a look at them
	Cluster-0.txt - First 16 Blocks of the device
	Phy-Cam-57-sector.txt - 57th sector of the device (claimed FAT
in
Partition table)
Thanks & Regards,
Mukund Jampala
