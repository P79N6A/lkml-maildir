I'm a college student too and I wished a wish like that in the past. After 
watching the development process for a while, I realized that somehow
a college final project won't fit with the linux kernel project.
Everything here is done by _evolution_ not a revolution, you'll even see the 
highest matured programmers in this project send little patches day by day. 
And the problem that you can't meet your PH.D and tell him/her: hey, I have
a patch or two, they simply don't understand that ;).
Second, I think it's very hard to make a considerable project in the kernel
without doing some little patches here and there at first. Google for kernel
newbies and kernel janitors.
