Sure, that's sensible, to only protect the important stuff.
But even if the chances of hitting this are slim, we still need a way
out. For most people anything is better than a hung box.
Some examples;
 For a desktop (where people may be experimenting with the feature) -
seeing your firefox process evaporate due to the OOM killer and then
finding a message explaining what happened in dmesg is a lot less
frustrating than a hang or sudden reboot.
 For a server - If you mis-configure the new feature you may be in for
a long drive to reboot a box whereas falling back to the classic OOM
killer (+ nasty messages in dmesg) will likely save you the trip and
clue you in as to what you mis-configured.
 For an embedded box - triggering a reboot would probably be better
than both a hang or classic OOM kill in many cases (better to have the
device reboot and come back working than to hang or start
malfunctioning due to a missing process).
So maybe what's needed is an additional knob for people to tweak - one
that selects what should happen in this rare case: 1) fallback to
classic OOM (default), 2) reboot, 3) hang.   In all cases messages
should be logged explaining what happened.
Or is that overkill?  If so I'd personally prefer just falling back to
classic OOM kill in this case.
A way out for the "OOM but all processes below threshold" case +
perhaps coupled with oomthresh applying to process groups instead of
just processes and I personally start to like this feature.
Let's see some code...
