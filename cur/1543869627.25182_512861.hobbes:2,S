It is rc1 - and crashes.
I test on i386 via epia (the only machine which runs x86 right now).
If there will not be any new patches, I will create 2.6.20 test tree
tomorrow.

Ok, I will create such a monster tomorrow :)
I will use the same base for threadlet as for kevent/epoll - there is no
parser, just sendfile() of the static file which contains http header
and actual page.
threadlet1 {
	accept() 
	create threadlet2 {
		send data
	}
}
Is above scheme correct for threadlet scenario?
But note, that on my athlon64 3500 test machine kevent is about 7900
requests per second compared to 4000+ epoll, so expect a challenge.
lighhtpd is about the same 4000 requests per second though, since it can
not be easily optimized for kevents.
