I sent patches to the fastboot list at the same time I sent these ones
to support differences in the underlying hypervisor architecture in the
tools.
They haven't appeared in the archives yet so I fear they have gone
astray. I'll resend when I get to the office in a bit.
The tools already have support for introducing a SHIM when kexecing
between different architectures (at least in the 64->32 direction if I
understand kexec-tools-testing/purgatory/arch/i386/compat_x86_64.S and
k-t-t.../kexec/arch/i386/compat_x86_64.S correctly). This is really just
an extension of that.

It works fine under Xen and I think going from 64Xen+32Kernel->32Kernel
makes more sense than going from 64Xen+32Kernel->64Kernel. As I said
originally I'm not so convinced it makes sense in the native case but I
see no reason to outlaw it (people get to keep both pieces etc...)
