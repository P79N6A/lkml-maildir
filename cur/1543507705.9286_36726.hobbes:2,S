	I tried changing the fdisk code to turn off the
	limitation of the -b option to try a read for 4k.
	Then, it never even got that far: it couldn't get past
	the malloc() call right about:
	fdisk.c:566:		if (!(buffers[partitions] = (char *) malloc(sector_size)))
	fdisk.c:567:			fatal(out_of_memory);
	This worked up to -b 2258, but anything higher wouldn't work.
You wrote a buggy C program, where you tried to read a lot
into a small buffer. In other words, if you `turn off the
limitation' then you also have to increase MAX_SECTOR_SIZE.
