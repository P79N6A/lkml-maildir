Hi all.
I've tried to send this a number of times, but don't
think it ever made it through, so I'll give it one
more go.
I've given every stable kernel release newer than
2.6.17.14 a compile and run, and each time, I am
getting the same hangup as the kernel boots.
For 2.6.18.*, I get the following:
--snip--
kernel driver mapping tables up to 100000000 @
8000-d000
--snip--
Nothing more. For 2.6.19:
--snip--
kernel is alive
kernel driver mapping tables up to 100000000 @
8000-d000
--snip--
Nothing more. Outside of any new options added to make
config, I am using the same .config as 2.6.17.14,
which runs perfectly. I'm running this on native
x86_64, if it helps; slamd64 (Slackware derivative) is
the distro. everything is stock from that (gcc 3.4.6,
libc-2.3.6, make-3.81, binutils-2.16.92).
Any ideas? If you need the .config, let me know and
I'll include it.
BL.
