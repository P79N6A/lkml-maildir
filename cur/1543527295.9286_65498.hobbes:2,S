procfs is for process information (I'll be playing the part of purist today.)
If you want a kernel reporting facility, allow me to introduce a little thing
called 'printk()' :-)  What everyone is attaching to procfs is more aptly
data for a kernelfs. (Yes, that's a BSDism.)

YES!  Gee, let's give untrusted things access to /proc.  There's all sorts
of "good stuff" in there.  This can be quite a security problem.  BUT, due
to the fact that some information cannot be gotten anywhere but /proc, you
have to give them access to it. (Metaphor warning) Would you let a stranger
into your home to use the bath room?

NO.  procfs was design for PROCESS INFORMATION.  Over the years, people have
attached non-process information in there.  It's become the city dump for
any information one needs to get out of the kernel.

No it's not.  That's one of the foundations of perl.  I've seen (and even
written) some highly complex perl programs (yes, programs, not scripts)
that did all kinds of things with binary data structures.  Most people
don't write _programs_ in perl; they write _scripts_ for doing a specific
task quickly.  Any real programmer can do just as quickly in C what they
can do in perl.
But, we're arguing religions now.  The point is, there's no reason to
condeme everyone to inefficient text processing for the few people who
refuse to write programs or deal with binary information.

Wrong.  Do some analysis of procfs accesses and you'll see most of the access
to procfs information is never seen by a human. (This excludes 'ps' information
as that's what's supposed to be in there _and_ it's mostly binary data in
the first place.)

Wrong.  How often do you read /proc/net/dev?  Granted, there are many things
in /proc that are often reprocessed for displaying to a human (netstat data
for one.)  HOWEVER, that information is read as text, converted to binary,
processed, and then converted back to text and displayed.
Unless you intend on using 'cat' to view everything, my arguement stands.
(/proc/pci is about the only thing routinely 'cat'ed.  However, there is
 strong pressure to remove it in favor of a userland app to *gasp* process
 the binary data -- of course, the "binary" data in /proc/bus/pci is presented
 as text.)

Easy != Efficient.  And it's easier to read a number as a number and not have
to hunt for it in the text and then convert it from text to binary.  THAT is
my beef.

Oh good god!  Every programmer should be forced to program for an embeded
system for a day.  Maybe then people would stop doing such stupid things.
The human brain can parse text very effectively.  Computers don't!  Having
taught computer science for a few years, I can tell you that's not
"convenient" for programmers.  Most of the errors students make are in
processing human formated input.  Converting data from a machine format
to a human format to only turn it back into a machine format is just
wrong.

Turn off procfs and you'll see... ifconfig, netstat, mount, modutils, kudzu,
lmsensors, free, alot of sysconf()...

chroot() _does_ address them.  It also isolated applications from the rest
of the filesystem.  Alot of chroot()ed things are done this way to
specifically to keep them away from /proc (and more importanyly "/")

It's not the individual driver's resposibility to keep up with it.  What you
suggest is the replication of read() handling code for functions providing
data via procfs.  NO.  The correct place to put this is in the procfs layer
that calls the specific driver's read() function.  I was amazed to see that
wasn't already done.  And in fact, putting the handling in the driver is
hard to do correctly without introducing a memory leak. (or breaking a few
modules)
This is 100% the fault of procfs.  Code needs to be placed in the open()
and close() functions for handling read()s without calling the driver's
function over and over again.  The driver should then allocate sufficient
space for the data and return a pointer to it -- that's it for the driver.
procfs can chew on that buffer all it wants until close() or the app flushes
the fd.  This is very clean, robust, and efficient.  It also helps to close
a few potential races and increases kernel performance (altho' probablly not
measurablly -- as I recall, some of the /proc/net information spinlock()s
the kernel due to potential races.)
