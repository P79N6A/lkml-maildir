Subject: [RFC: 2.6 patch] add -fno-tree-scev-cprop to KBUILD_CFLAGS

The gcc from svn that will become gcc 4.3 generates libgcc calls in 
cases like the following (on 32bit architectures):
<--  snip  -->
static inline void timespec_add_ns(struct timespec *a, u64 ns)
{
...
        while(ns >= NSEC_PER_SEC) {
                ns -= NSEC_PER_SEC;
                a->tv_sec++;
        }
...
<--  snip  -->
It can make sense to emit assembler code doing division for such C code -
that doesn't seem to be something that would generally be wrong.
But the kernel does (at least on some architectures) not link with 
libgcc or ship other code providing the required libgcc functions.
Richard Guenther suggested in gcc bug #32044 to use -fno-tree-scev-cprop 
(new option in gcc 4.3) as a workaround and I confirmed that it fixes 
the compilation.
