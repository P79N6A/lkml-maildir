Hi Everyone!
Quota Hash Abstraction provides more flexibility for all
kinds of quota extensions (for example mount point quota,
or quota domains), while retaining full compatibility to
the current quota hash implementation.
updated the patches for 2.4.23-pre8 and 2.6.0-test9 ...
you can get them at:
http://www.13thfloor.at/patches/patch-2.4.23-pre8-qh0.12.diff.bz2
http://www.13thfloor.at/patches/patch-2.6.0-test9-qh0.12.diff.bz2
QHA is available for 2.4.22 and 2.6.0, so it should be 
quite easy to give it a try ... so please if somebody does 
some performance checks on this code, send me a copy of 
the results ...
enjoy,
Herbert
