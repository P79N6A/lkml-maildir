Hi all!
 My 13GB Seagate HD introduces a problem:
 The root partition is big enough, that certain
 files are beyond the 1024 cylinder boundary.
 Currently the kernel images are all "on the 
 bright side" of this boundary.
 But what happens, when I will update this
 kernels?
   mv /usr/src/v2.3.9/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage /vmlinuz239 will
   internally copy the file to the root to new sectors, than delete
   the old kernel. Result: The new image will be placed beyond
   the magic limit. The boot will fail
   OR
   mv /usr/src/v2.3.9/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage /vmlinuz239 will
   internally copy the file directly over the sectors occupied
   by the old kernel. Result: The box still boots.
 I am using lilo 0.21.
 Thank you for any help in advance!
