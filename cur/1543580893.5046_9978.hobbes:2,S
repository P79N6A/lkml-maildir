The units seem to vary. I suggest using fundamental SI units.
That would be meters, kilograms, seconds, and maybe a very
few others -- my memory fails me on this.
Power meter applets will be eternally buggy if you force them
to deal with units that change. In fact there is no reason to
print the units if you always use the fundamental units.
