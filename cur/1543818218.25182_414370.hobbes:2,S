System is a DEC Alpha 433au with two SCSI disks.  SCSI controller is a
QLA1040 supported by the qla1280 driver.  Runs 2.6.16 fine.  Tried
booting 2.6.17-rc1 and got
kobject_add failed for 0:0: with -EEXIST, don't try to register things with the same name in the same directory
and a fairly long trace output when the system attempted to add sdb.
Not surprisingly, sdb was inaccessible.
Normally (for 2.6.16 anyway), the following relationship exists:
sd 0:0:0:0	sda
sd 0:0:1:0	sdb
More information *might* be available if needed, but will have to be
transcribed by hand.  My /usr partition is on sdb, so I don't get very
far with 2.6.17-rc1 on Alpha :-).  The problem is probably specific to
the qla1280 or the Alpha, as I have a x86 Adaptec SCSI-based system
with multiple spindles that works fine with 2.6.17-rc1.
