It oopses at shutdown?  I thought this was originally reported as a
"will not power off" which for a while was attributed to the cpufreq fix
that went into -rc2 or -rc3.
I didn't realize there was an oops, sorry.

Sorry, I thought this was just a warning at boot time.
It would be interesting to see if reverting the pci_bus patch did
anything about the fact that we register the root PCI bus through two
different methods.
