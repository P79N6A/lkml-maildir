   I can think of the only case where domain info might be interesting - if
   some device wants to know whether it can talk to another device directly.
   We have pci_controller_num(pdev) for this.
That is an insufficient way to determine this.  Maybe I can make two
PCI devices talk to each other transparently between two domains
using an IOMMU?
