    SSH 2.x which is now propritary included GMP, but they went so far as to
    search and replace varible names and strip off copyright notices.
Torbjorn believes that the SSH code was copied from GMP.  The SSH
developers say that the similarities are small and just a matter of
using some similar algorithms.  I've asked Torbjorn to make a more
complete list of similarities, so we can change this from an "I said
this, he said that" matter to a matter which can be decided
rationally.
Once I see what the real situation is, and I know whether there's an
issue to enforce, then I'll think about how to do it.
