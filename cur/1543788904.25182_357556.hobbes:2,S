Well, I've had this patch (to 2.6.13) failing once, whereas I still 
haven't been able to reproduce the error with your previous patch. What 
now? A bit worrying is that test results are not 100% deterministic now... 
Which means, until recently my standard test (copy about 150M co the 
CD-RW && sync) produced always consistent results, now I've seen a couple 
of times the same driver version either failing or succeeding...
BTW, Peter, I still get errors from mails to you:

Thanks
