For system devices, no, I don't think so.

I don't think it's true for anything other than memory.  Linux doesn't
manage CPUs or nodes any differently than it manages its internal
representations of them.
But, for memory at a level any less granular than pages, Linux and the
hardware seldom have the same view.

Even with generic names mapping back to components should be easy
Somethinng like memory/type could even contain the hardware type of each
ram entry.

No, it wouldn't really be too much of a problem.  But, it's not a very
accurate description.  There is certainly hardware that has RAM which
does not have a single DIMM. :)

RAM would probably be fine.  There should be very few properties
that /sys/devices/system devices share with /sys/block, so it shouldn't
be too bad.

I don't think there's much of a consensus.  I just want to make sure we
do something that works on all platforms consistently.  For instance,
I'd hate to have every userspace utilities that are trying to examine
memory look like this:
if [ `uname -a` == ppc64 ]; then
	UNIT=LMB
elif [ `uname -a` == ia64 ]; then
	UNIT=DIMM
etc...
