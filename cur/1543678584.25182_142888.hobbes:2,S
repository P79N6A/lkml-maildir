Actually, it seems that most architectures do...
static inline unsigned long
__copy_from_user(void *to, const void __user *from, unsigned long n)
{
        if (__builtin_constant_p(n)) {
                unsigned long ret;
                switch (n) {
                case 1:
...so it should be exactly as fast. Ahha, not arm.
If I wanted to optimize it, first step would be to copy over something
else than bytes. I'm afraid I do not want to optimize it.
