They vary based on the CPU clock, the dividers from PCI to ISA on PCI
based boxes, and on the ISA only ones often on the CPU speed.
Unfortunately the way you control that divider or read it is chipset
specific. Nor would it be reasonable to expect the end user to set it.
For PC/104 systems the same applies today.

The question (for ISA peripherals) is "why bother", and with the 8390
patch there are one or two dubious PCI driver users of _p left but not
much else that isn't ISA or chipset logic. The question for chipset logic
where it has become integrated is "can we get rid of it for some devices,
if not what can we use instead"
