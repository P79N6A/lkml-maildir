Now I know I was branded a troll earlier for saying that
Larry used mild DRM, but I thought it monitored and gave samples
of code to make sure closed source things wern't made with the 
free version, and it monitored push, pull activity, Which is why
I wonder if Larry has any Ideas, but I never made to insinuate he
was "evil". Especially as I like the BK/CVS gatway.
