No I don't use very many symlinks on my webservers.  But I do see memory 
usage similar to what you have.  One thing I have noticed on my webservers 
is that before a crash, pretty much everything but apache gets swapped 
out.  That includes syslogd, klogd, inetd, mingetty, crond, atd, 
etc...  But there will only be 100 to 150 apache child processes running 
when things start to get swapped out.  A typical server of mine has a 
Pentium III 450-500, 256M ram, adaptec 2940U2 scsi card, seagate 9 gig 
drive and Intel EtherExpress Pro nic.
A couple weeks ago I set up 2.2.13 with ikd and serial consoles on several 
of my server.  But when a server locks up, SysRq (or Break with the serial 
console) doesn't work or get anything to the console.  I've checked the 
memory in these servers with memtest and memtest-86 and it comes out error 
free.
So I'm scratching my head like Ward is doing, not really knowing what else 
to try.  I'm certainly open to suggestions, because I'm kinda stumped.

ps. I did try Savochkin Vladimirovich's new eepro100 driver.  That did take 
care of some network problems I was seeing on a couple server.  The other 
interesting thing was that one of my web servers had a light load on it and 
had an uptime of 70+ days.  But last week I started pointing more traffic 
to it and it has needed rebooting 3 times in the last 7 days.
