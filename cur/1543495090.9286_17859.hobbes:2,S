Apologies to all,
Nashville, TN got the tail end of the stuff that clobbered the Mid-West
part of the States.  My facility has been without power for two days.
Thus mail and web access to the patches was out of service also.
There will be a "foxtrot" version of the patch shortly.
See next message........

Will duplicate the 16383/16/63 LBA test with a 16383/15/63 since the
sector count will be different.
