I'd prefer to keep this as is for now (sorta the uglier the better ;-)
I really hope it's the short term solution as we need some feedback from gcc
folks. We use named sections quite a lot, but gcc is sort of unfriendly with
these, and this particular problem is not the main one.
For instance, if someone dares to put a 'switch' statement into discarded
section (__exit), the final link fails (on any arch!), because gcc generates
a jump table in .rodata which references that discarded section...
Ivan.
