Cool, thanks for the reply. I'm quite happy to go to 2.6.7 if that's 
what you'll be patching against.
Are you still looking for people who can reproduce this problem? If so 
I'll try and find a couple of the CDs that I have that kill ripping now 
on this kernel before applying any patches you come up with.
