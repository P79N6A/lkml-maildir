Ok.
I vehemently disagree with your design ideas. So do lots of other
people, and I have not seen one single person ever speak up in favor of
your ideas. So far, you have no agreement at all.

Remarkable. I agree completely with this paragraph, but draw the
opposite conclusion that you do.
Having private LSMs per container means having a separate kernel per
container. That would seem to put that idea in the "heavy" category.
Which is why I suggested that people who want to do what you desire
should use full VMM instead of containers.

It is rejected for perfectly sound engineering reasons like complexity
bloat and memory bloat. Come back with a workable design or STFU.

In "theory" as long as this theory ignores the fact that all distros
patch their kernel. So yeah, you can run different "distros" as long as
you don't care about device support, and you ignore which LSM you want
to use.
Containers fundamentally share the kernel, and the LSM module(s) loaded
are part of the kernel, and therefore are fundamentally shared among the
Containers.

This is one of your impossible dreams. For file access controls to be
"common between LSM's" there would have to be one file access model that
everyone can agree on. It is quite clear that this is not the case, and
Linus has said, clearly and repeatedly, that he *will not* arbitrarily
choose one.
Give it up. You cannot have this. Stop being foolish :)

If you need such a feature, then design it, build it, and propose a
patch. But be prepared for more resistance to your idea if it ends up
breaking all the existing LSM code and modules.

I still don't get the problem you are trying to solve.
There *are* problems with containers and LSMs; LSMs are currently
system-wide, and not customizable per container. I believe this is
mostly fixable within each LSM, and may only require some modest changes
to LSM to achieve. I would much rather be discussing what that would
require than arguing this impossible dream of One True File Access
Control model, which will never happen in our lifetimes.

You hope. Except that there are 2 big problems with this dream:
   1. One of your "segments" is file access control, and there is
      fundamental conflict over how file access control should be done.
      So segmenting LSM fails to achieve anything here.
   2. Segmenting security models fragments them. One security model may
      well depend on all of its "segments" supporting a certain
      property, and if you break it apart, it is no longer secure.
So while you hope for lots of nice things, I think this is an absolutely
horrible, unworkable idea.

It was never intended to do that. It was deliberately designed so that
Linux could accommodate diverse LSM designs in the same kernel, without
having to achieve global agreement on what the right model is.

Says you. I think it is a design success. It has produced more practical
shared code and cooperation among otherwise conflicting camps of
security philosophies than anything I know of, at least since the IPSec
interop wars.
Of course LSM can be improved. But that will require specific, well
thought-out design proposals, not vague dreams like assuming we can have
one file access control model (we can't) and that such segmentation
would help security (it won't, it will break security).

Ok. So do ulimits. What's your point?

No it does not. That requires a private kernel per container. Guess
what: that means heavyweight virtualization.

A very, very simple security model: total isolation.
Security models have 2 extremes: "total sharing" (think MS DOS from
1990) and "total isolation" (think separate physical machines with no
network in between). These two models are very easy to implement. What
is difficult in security is controlled sharing.
LSMs are always designed to facilitate some kind of controlled sharing.
SELinux, AppArmor, LIDS, TOMOYO, MultiADM, they all implement some kind
of mechanism so that you can write a policy that determines which
objects are shared, and which are not.

That is a truly crappy security model. Instead of a policy controlling
which objects get to be shared (these files over here are shared, those
files over there are private) you have a model that determines which
*classes* of objects are shared (files are private, memory is shared).
Of course this configuration has nice flexibility for performance. But
as a security model it is hopeless.

... is a job for full virtualization, not Containers. Testing a security
model means messing with the kernel, which is fundamentally shared
across containers.

Security features never did stop at LSM. LSM is about kernel-mediated
access control. There's lots of other security issues that don't have
anything to do with LSM, and always have been.
A PAM feature that disallows a user to switch to root is an interesting
idea. But it seems to me that it requires kernel mediation to do it, and
likely would be best done in an LSM.

Yes, you could do that. But the total isolation imposed by Containers
would be horrible compared to the controlled isolation provided by LSMs.

I submit that supporting mixed distros on one kernel is an inappropriate
goal for both LSM and for Containers. It is a job best done by full
virtualization.
Containers are a great way to give each container user a virtual private
copy of the host distro. Don't break the lightweight property by trying
to make Containers do too much, it will just turn into a bad clone of
full virtualization.

False: Linux desktops have been around since the dawn of Linux. I was

ROFL. False. Linux applications have always sought to run across
distros, and have always wanted to be secure. An application that wants
to be secure can:
    * bundle an AppArmor profile in its RPM or Deb that secures it on
      any AppArmor-supporting distro (SUSE, Ubuntu, Mandriva, Annvix,
      etc.) and have no effect on non-AppArmor platforms
    * bundle an SELinux targeted policy in its RPM that secures it on
      any SELinux-supporting distro (RHEL, Fedora, Hardened Gentoo,
      Engarde, etc.) and have no effect on non-SELinux platforms
    * do both at the same time to provide security across all of the
      above distros
So I don't know WtF you are talking about here.

Translation: it is in the way of your goals, so you criticize it to try
to get agreement to get it out of your way. LSM is not generally
difficult to work with, it is difficult for *you* to work with, which is
not the same thing.

Certainly LSM and Containers interact, and can and should be modified to
work together better. But your specific ideas are IMHO badly broken. I
would like to discuss other possibilities, with a principle focus on how
a single kernel LSM can support per-Container policy sets.
