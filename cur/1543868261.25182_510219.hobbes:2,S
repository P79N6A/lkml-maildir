Two problems:
1) A showstopper with the root partition on RAID1:
md: raid1 personality registered for level 1
[--snip--]
md: multipath personality registered for level -4
register_blkdev: failed to get major for mdp
[--snip--]
VFS: Cannot open root device "md1" or unknown-block(0,0)
At the moment I have no serial console attached to the box, so I had to rewrite
the messages manually.
2) On HPC nx6325 I get the following 100% of the time during the resume from
disk:
BUG: at drivers/pci/pci.c:823 pcim_enable_device()
Call Trace:

Nevertheless, the system seems to be fully functional after the resume.
[I've been observing it since 2.6.20-git10 and have reported it for a couple
of times, but apparently nobody cares. :-(]
Greetings,
Rafael
