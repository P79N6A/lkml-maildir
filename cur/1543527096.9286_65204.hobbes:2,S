Congratulations.  :-)

Yuck.  Having a write pointer, read pointer, and count is just plain
stupid.  It's much better to calculate the count from the pointers 
whenever needed.  (Always leave one location free in the buffer too,
otherwise read_ptr == write_ptr when full, which is of course the same as 
empty.)  This way, you don't need to update two variables when poking data
into the buffer and also when reading it out.  More importantly, there's
no need for locking between the reader and writer.
