Of course, but I'd say very few people will. Then again maybe

To be honest I haven't tested so this is an unfounded guess. However
it is based on what I have seen of Mel's numbers, and the fact that
the kernel spends nearly 1/3rd of its time in the page allocator when
running a kbuild.
I may get around to getting some real numbers when my current patch
queues shrink.

True and I'm also annoyed that we have these issues at all. I just
don't see that the avoidance strategy helps that much because as I
said, you don't need to keep these lovely contiguous regions just for
show (or other easy-to-reclaim user pages).
The absolute priority is to move away from higher order allocs or
use fallbacks IMO. And that doesn't necessarily mean order 1 or even
2 allocations because we've don't seem to have a problem with those.
Because I want Linux to be as robust as you do.

I think this isn't as bad an idea as you think. If it means those
guys doing memory hotplug take a few % performance hit and nobody else
has to bear the costs then that sounds great.

True, but we don't seem to have huge problems with other things. The
main ones that have come up on lkml are e1000 which is getting fixed,
and maybe XFS which I think there are also moves to improve.
