But this one can, and it sure seems like the appropriate
solution.  For reasons like the one not quoted above:  it's
a good way to eliminate what would otherwise be a case
where a dmabounce is needed.  And hey wow, it even uses
the API designed to reduce such DMA "mapping" costs, and
there are drivers already using it for such purposes.

You mentioned ioremap(), which doesn't help here since
the need is for a block of memory, not just address space,
and also memcpy_toio(), which just another tool to implement
the dma bouncing (which is on the "strongly avoid!" list).
As I said, those still don't make dma_alloc_coherent() work.
