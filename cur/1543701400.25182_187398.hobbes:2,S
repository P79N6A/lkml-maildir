My plan has been to essentially use a hashed disk serial number
for this "any old unique value". The problem is that "any old"
is easy enough, but "unique" is more difficult.
Naming devices is very difficult, but in some important cases,
like SCSI or IDE disks, that would work and give a stable name.
The kernel must not invent consecutive numbers - that does not
lead to stable names. Setting this up correctly is nontrivial.
