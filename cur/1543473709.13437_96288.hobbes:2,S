Interesting. The NCP packets come from the user space daemon, so it could
be an NCP daemon originated problem, or maybe a driver problem. Im not sure
IPX itself can trip this.
Do you have a box with an IBM tr card you can try to eliminate IPX. Also can
you strace the "slist" and see if strace shows it bersekely sending 80K packets
