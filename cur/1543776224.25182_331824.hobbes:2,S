I already have 4KSTACKS on. Latency tracing is enabled, but STACKOVERFLOW 
isn't; I'll just reenable everything again until we fix this. Do you think if 
I removed the printk() line I might get some useful information, before it 
does the stack trace?
I'm happy enough to work with this indefinitely now, at least I have a certain 
cause for the lockups, so I can continue to use the machine for R&D.
