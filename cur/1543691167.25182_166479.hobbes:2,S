Well, I do understand the bounce buffer problem, but honestly the current way
of handling the situation seems questionable at least. If you ever tried such a
system you notice it is a lot worse than just dumping the additional ram above
4GB. You can really watch your network connections go bogus which is just
unacceptable. Is there any thinkable way to ommit the bounce buffers and still
do something useful with the beyond-4GB ram parts?
We should not leave the current bad situation as is...
Regards,
Stephan
