Then do this once in the "add" notifier.

No, bad EB is a perfectly legal thing and you should deal with it. Error

No, the action should be returning an error and refuse doing more work.

Well, it is matter of taste so I do not insist. But I think
wait_event_interruptible() is much nicer. Glance at drivers/ubi/io.c how
