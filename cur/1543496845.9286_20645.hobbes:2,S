   All at interrupt time. I wonder how do you solve this problem with
   serial ports: these days serials can be easily driven at speeds close
   to 1Mbit... (I'm talking about dumb on-board serials like NS PC87108).
I simply haven't see much demand or practical application for high-speed
serial transfers.  It's restricted to short distance unless you use
*very* expensive cables, and you can get better performance more cheaply
simply by using Ethernet instead.  10 Megabit ethernet cards are dirt
cheap, and Cat 5 UTP cables are much, much cheaper than high-quality
serial cables, and you can run them for a much greater distance without
worrying about noise or signal degredation problems.
The only reason why high-speed serial might be interesting is for those
IR ports that look like serial ports, and there aren't that many
interesting applications requiring that yet.  I do intend to fix this; I
just haven't seen a huge urgency to it.  If someone has an actual,
real-life application, let me know....
