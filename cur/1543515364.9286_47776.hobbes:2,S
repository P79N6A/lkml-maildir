Right.  The standard way of sharing driver memory with user space is to
allocate the memory inside the driver code first, and then to mmap()
that into user space --- not the other way around.
Do it that way, and the driver owns the memory all the time.  That way
you can do whatever locking you want without having to play about with
random pages of user data.

Yes.
