you'll have to upgrade to the latest stable raidtools version:
    
http://www
.<*>.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/raid/alpha/raidtools-19990824-0.90.tar.gz
this will mean you'll have to convert your mdtools command (and/or
/etc/mdtab) to raidtools commands and a /etc/raidtab specifying your
configuration. The layout of the physical devices is forward (and
backwards) compatible, and you can still keep mdtools around in case you
boot back into an older kenrel. You also might want to read the RAID HOWTO
at:

(it's being merged. mdtools never supported raid1/4/5.)
