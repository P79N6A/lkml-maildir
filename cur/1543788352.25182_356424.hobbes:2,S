I'm back with my old IDE CD problem - the one that got DMA broken in 2.4 
(see 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0410.3/0480.html
). I 
again stumped upon a problem that hangs IDE CD access with Sony CDU5211 
on ICH2. Running 2.6.14-rc3 + yesterdays git.
I tried "blktool /dev/hdc id" and it hangs in D state in blk_execute_rq. 
Dmesg tells
hdc: CDU5211, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
[...]
hdc: ATAPI 52X CD-ROM drive, 120kB Cache, UDMA(33)

hdc: cdrom_pc_intr: The drive appears confused (ireason = 0x02)
and so on every now and then.
