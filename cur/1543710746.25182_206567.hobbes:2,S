Subject: [PATCH] [CFT] elfdiet reduces binfmt_elf
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/3/15/137

The elfdiet patch reduces code space and time in the handling of execve()
for binfmt_elf executables.  On x86 the net savings is about 1100 bytes
in size (11% of fs/binfmt_elf.o) and 2.5% in time.  Also, each Elf_Phdr
gets its own .bss as appropriate, including p_flags access permissions.
This can be used by programs such as Wine to reserve address space with
no memory commit charge.
As of March 15, the patch is BETA test quality; I run it in all the time
in normal use on i686 FC2test1.   Please test and report, especially
64-bit machines.
