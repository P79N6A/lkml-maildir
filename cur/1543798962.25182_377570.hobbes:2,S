Ah - perhaps not so.  Adding my SGI colleague Greg Edwards to the cc
list.  My email archives suggest that he enabled CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT
in ia64 sn2_defconfig a few months ago, and I presume did so intentionally.
The change enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT was:
    user:        Greg Edwards <edwardsg@sgi.com>
    date:        Tue Aug 16 23:38:16 2005 +0011
    summary:     [IA64] Refresh arch/ia64/configs/sn2_defconfig.
Greg - CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT adds a couple of pages of assembly code 
due to various BUG checks beneath rcu_read_lock() on some hot code
paths (which is where rcu is most popular).  See the two calls
add_preempt_count() and sub_preempt_count() in kernel/sched.c.
Was this intentional to enable CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT in sn2_defconfig?
Other evidence opposing this DEBUG opttion:
    Most other DEBUG options are turned off in the defconfigs.
Other evidence supporting setting this DEBUG option:
    We're not the only arch enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT.  See also:
