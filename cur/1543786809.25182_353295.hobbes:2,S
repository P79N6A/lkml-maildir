Subject: [PATCH 05/21] mm: anon is already wrprotected
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/25/62

do_anonymous_page's pte_wrprotect causes some confusion: in such a case,
vm_page_prot must already be forcing COW, so must omit write permission,
and so the pte_wrprotect is redundant.  Replace it by a comment to that
effect, and reword the comment on unuse_pte which also caused confusion.
