Sure.

This is where we disagree.  The existence of devices you cannot stably 
enumerate does not eliminate the existence of devices you trivially can.
Pulling out the "IBM numa cluster with multiple SAS enclosures _and_ firewire" 
infrastructure to find the root partition on my hard drive may be good for 
the IBM numa clusters, but only at the expense of complicating this part of 
my laptop's infrastructure by an order of magnitude, and making embedded 
systems nearly impossible to put together.  If "one size fits all" were true, 
my cell phone would be running Red Hat Enterprise.

So you break the IDE drives to get laptop users to debug the Niagra set?  The 
solution is to make the easy cases hard?

In this case, I ripped the relevant infrastructure out by hand so fstab again 
has /dev/sda.  I can do it again on future systems.  I'd just really rather 
not have to.

There are actually more special cases, you just expose more people to them.

It's /dev/srX here, and I have no idea.
I believe merging these namespaces invents problems, and was a bad idea.  I 
understand you're reasoning, but imposing the problems of mainframes onto 
laptops does not strike me as an improvement for laptops.

Here it's
  ls /dev/disk/by-path/
  pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0        pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0-part4
  pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0-part1  pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0-part5
  pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0-part2  pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0-part6
  pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0-part3  pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-1:0:0:0
And this is an improvement?

Is your definition of "the large majority of uses" where ncr Voyager, the 
Amiga, and current macintosh laptops are all one use each, or is your 
definition of "the large majority of uses" the one where each "use" is an 
installation, of which there are millions of PCs (and even more ARM cell 
phones), and something like three instances of Voyager?
I realize that both views are valid.  This is why the US has a house and a 
senate, and filters things through both views.  My gripe is that forcing my 
laptop to look at my USB devices to find my SATA hard drive is aligned with 
only one of those viewpoints, and completely opposed to the other.
An approach that makes things much easier on laptops is seen to hurt big iron, 
not because it the approach itself has a direct negative impact on big iron, 
but only because then laptops are not saddled with the problems of big iron.
Why do you allow uni-processor kernel builds then?
