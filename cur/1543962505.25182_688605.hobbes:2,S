Ok, I'll do it ASAP.

I'm still working on it since I'd like to record from 4 channels at
time but I can't... here my custom settings:
static unsigned char int1410_eeprom[] __devinitdata = {
        [ICE_EEP1_CODEC]        = 0x1f,
        [ICE_EEP1_ACLINK]       = 0x00,
        [ICE_EEP1_I2SID]        = 0x01,
        [ICE_EEP1_SPDIF]        = 0x03,
        [ICE_EEP1_GPIO_MASK]    = 0xff,
        [ICE_EEP1_GPIO_STATE]   = 0xff,
        [ICE_EEP1_GPIO_DIR]     = 0xff,
};
static int __devinit snd_ice1712_int1410_init(struct snd_ice1712 *ice)
{
        printk("%s\n", __FUNCTION__);
        /* Set the pro AC97 codecs */
        ice->ac97_codecs = 4;
        /* Set the analog DACs/ADCs */
        ice->num_total_dacs = 8;
        ice->num_total_adcs = 8;
        return 0;
}
/* entry point */
struct snd_ice1712_card_info snd_ice1712_eurotech_cards[] __devinitdata =
{
        {
                .subvendor      = ICE1712_SUBDEVICE_INT1410,    /* a dummy id */
                .name           = "Eurotech INT 1410",
                .model          = "int1410",
                .chip_init      = snd_ice1712_int1410_init,
                .build_controls = snd_ice1712_int1410_add_controls,
                .no_mpu401      = 1,
                .eeprom_size    = sizeof(int1410_eeprom),
                .eeprom_data    = int1410_eeprom,
                .driver         = "int1410",
        },
        { } /* terminator */
};
But I'm a bit confused regarding how to enable such feature. Again,
should I use a multitrack audio recorder as ecasound or I can just use
arecord with some magic options? :)
Thanks,
Rodolfo
