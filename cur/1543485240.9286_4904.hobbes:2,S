The HOWTOs I read on implementing CD-RW indicated you needed to disable
generic PCI IDE support when compiling the kernel.  The option to turn
on automatic DMA transfers only appears when that support is turned on.
It shouldn't be a problem if that advice is followed.
In any case, I noticed that when built that way I don't get DMA enabled
for a hard drive which has a CDROM/CDR/CDRW on the same IDE interface.
