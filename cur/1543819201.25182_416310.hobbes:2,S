if you are asking this to install a linux distro on your machine,
you can just copy the vmlinux and the initrd.img (Fedora names, but most
likely other distros have named these similar) to your /boot and add
these to grub.conf and boot them that way.
if you are asking this because you want to hack a system please go away.
