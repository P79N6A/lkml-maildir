There are only about 850 file type_transition rules in the policy 
shipped with RHEL and the vast majority of them are templated so this 
isn't as hard as you think. Most are things like:
   type_transition ftpd_t tmp_t : file ftpd_tmp_t;
which 1) don't require relabeling to something else and 2) very easy to 
audit. A quick look suggests that the potentially less-restrictive label 
is never chosen, for example you'll see:
   type_transition groupadd_t etc_t : file shadow_t;
   type_transition useradd_t etc_t : file shadow_t;
Instead of the default transition being etc_t they are labeled as 
shadow_t (more restrictive) and then potentially relabled to etc_t.
That said, the lack of a type_transition in this case is as important as 
having one if the default type (the parent directory) is less 
restrictive. We already have tools that analyze policy and even tools to 
warn about potential errors in policy (apol and sechecker). It might be 
a good idea to add some more analysis to these tools to point out 
potential labeling errors that can be used in automatic analysis, which 
shouldn't be hard, I'll be sure to suggest that to the setools developers.

Several systems have gone off to ct&e and none of them use restorecond. 
These are custom build systems and relabeling is kept to a minimum and 
the applications are architected in a way that precludes this being 
necessary so I don't know what you are trying to get at here.

The "if" for SELinux is alot easier than you suggest. It certainly 
outweighs the disadvantages of the path based scheme IMHO.
