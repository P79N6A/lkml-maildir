Ok, this patch for 2.3.47 should fix it. Will commit it to vger soon.
The issue is that 2.3.47 for some reason reshuffles the objects and
libraries fed to the linker and the current scheme in arch/sparc/boot needs
to duplicate that exact order.
It would be much better if Linus accepted a change which moves the
vmlinux: rule into arch/*/Makefile because then this would never happen (on
sparc32 vmlinux: would be created from the already linked vmlinux.o and
btfix.o) plus make -j N would work again for sparc32 kernels.
