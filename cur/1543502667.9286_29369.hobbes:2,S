: Hmm... sorry, can't help you with this one. It should be related with your

	I don't agree - the line can be for example noisy enough for making
one of the ends loosing MAXALIVECNT keepalive packets and re-starting LCP,
while the other end thinks it is already up. My opinion is, that syncppp.c
should be able to recover from this situation cleanly.
	I will look at it when I come back.

The new code base has not stabilized enough yet for benchmarking. Be patient,
