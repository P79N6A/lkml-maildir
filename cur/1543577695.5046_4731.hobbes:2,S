I don't think this matters much, but I noticed that several of the
features available in the kernel configuration aren't relevent to 68k.
For example, in arch/m68knommu/config.in:
bool 'SGI Visual Workstation support' CONFIG_VISWS
bool 'PCI support' CONFIG_PCI
bool 'MCA support' CONFIG_MCA
bool 'Power Management support' CONFIG_PM
