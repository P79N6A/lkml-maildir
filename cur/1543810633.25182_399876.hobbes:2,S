I see that blktrace uses fwrite() in write_data(). Isn't it a disk write
scheme where you read() from the RelayFS channel and (f)write() to a file ? Oh,
but the mmaped file is the output.. I see. However, you have to mmap/unmap the
output file between each subbuffer, which costs you time.

As I said earlier, using sendfile() or mmap+send() should lead to a similar
result.

Yes, it has been my reaction too.

Well, if you want to try the current lttd disk dumper, it's quite simple : you
fork from blktrace, exec lttd with 2-3 parameters and it will simply open
recursively a directory structure, create the exact same trace directory
structure as output, mmap each buffer and wait for data. It quits when the last
buffer has hung up.
Once adapted to a network send(), I don't see any limitation in it's genericity.

I looked closely at the time keeping in the Kernel, and found out that
cycles_2_ns was using a precomputed variable which was not precise enough for my
needs, as it is computed with integers.
So I has two mode, one with and one without TSC. The simplest one is the TSC
mode, where I get the TSC of the CPUs. I also log the cpu_khz variable at the
beginning of the trace, so I can calculate the time myself from the tsc, but I
do it later, in double precision with the analyser.
In non TSC case, I use the jiffies counter or'd with a logical clock.
