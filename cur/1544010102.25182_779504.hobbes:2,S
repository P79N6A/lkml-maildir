Sure I understand that it's then a two-stage rocket for the first
context you fork off. I don't see how you qualify that as a *LOT* more
complicated...

Sure, but if your stuff gets merged then *I* have to fiddle with your
stuff as well when making changes. If you plan to keep your stuff out of
the kernel and maintain it there, fine, but I think you probably don't.
It's not a HUGE deal for this case, since you basically just want to use
alloc_io_context() and ioc_task_link(). So we can make the export and be
done with it.
