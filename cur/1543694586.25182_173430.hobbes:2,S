Hi
http://www.kerneltrap.org/~npiggin/v16/
I'm starting to do some large SMP / NUMA testing. Fixed and changed quite
a bit. It isn't too bad, although I'm only testing dbench, tbench, and
volanomark at the moment.
These SMP and NUMA changes are not tied to my interactivity stuff, so its
possible they could get included if they turn out well. If you find any
problems with it (high end or interactivity), please let me know.
