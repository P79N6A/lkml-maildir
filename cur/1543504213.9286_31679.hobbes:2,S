Really? Intel is telling us this for  years and i still don't buy it. After
all the same would hold true WRT graphics accelerators. DSP's are build for
a specific purpose and if you use them wisely you'll benefit. (Just look at
those WinModems  for an example of  the opposite). You wouldn't  too burden
your host processor with really unnecessary tasks.
