In my case, I'll be connected to a router using PPP, and it is  
supposed to forward DHCP requests out to the broader network.  I will  
then have to choose between DHCP servers based on some extended  
options such as location, software version, etc.
If I don't have an IP address yet, I am supposed to generate a random  
IP address in the 10.x.x.x range for use long enough until I accept  
an offer.   It would obviously have been easier for me if the router  
could run the dhcp client, and configured my IP address via PPP.
Since no one has been able to inform me that raw mode is usable via  
PPP, that leaves me with some of the other suggestions, such as  
sending broadcast DGRAMs, or some other possibilities I've thought of  
since yesterday, one of which may work, which involves using iptables.
I have to have a fallback solution since the equipment is not yet  
available to test with.   So I'm going by requirements of how it is  
supposed to work now.
Thanks,
Kevin
