Actually, I've heard that a chrooted _non-root_ process can find another
process with the same uid that's not chrooted and can ptrace() to pull
itself out of the jail.
I'd imagine dropping CAP_SYS_PTRACE would avoid this, though.

It appears that even dropping root privileges might not be enough.
And I realize that there are a number of ways that a root process can
escape, I was mostly objecting to the assertion that chroot() was secure
because everything before the chroot call is assumed to be trusted.
