Petr, do you have a corner I can hide in?  Andrew will whip me.
He nags me from time to time about that code, he's sceptical
whereas I believed it fragile but okay for now.  Looks like
you've caught me out, perhaps I should just take your POISON.
Hmm, it's really not what I want to be thinking about right now:
the real fix is to split_vma explicitly before the do_unmap, but
hard to get into that without opening up other cans of worms
(what to do if split_vma fails for lack of memory).  Many thanks
for the report, I won't be able to fix it in the next three days,
but will get back to you when I have a patch to try.
Hugh
