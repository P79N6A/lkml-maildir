Subject: hardware raid (adaptec 1200A)?

I'm setting up a new machine with a pair of IDE drives connected to
adaptec 1200A controller.  I defined a RAID-0 array using the adaptec
bios, but linux doesn't see it as a single drive.  It just sees two
drive, hde and hdg (each at their physical sizes).  Any hints?
