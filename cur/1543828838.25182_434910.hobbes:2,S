Hate to be a bother, but I think I must have botched something.
Here is what I did:
Downloaded kernel code.  
Applied the IDE patches (
http://zeniv.linux.org.uk/~alan/IDE
)
	(had to apply the change from ata_data_xfer calls to ops->data_xfer
	(no big deal, I speak C )
CONFIG_IDE is set to N

Device Drives\SCSI device support\Serial ATA (SATA) support: Y
Device Drives\SCSI device support\Serial ATA (SATA) support\NVIDIA SATA
support: Y
Device Drives\SCSI device support\Serial ATA (SATA) support\Promise SATA

Build the kernel, put it in /boot etc. and boot it.  The kernel finds the
motherboard IDE controllers and recognizes the two hard drives and the DVD
ROM drive there, but it does not appear to find the two Promise 20269
controllers.  What'd I do wrong?  Should I have applied the kernel-2.6.17
patches from kernel.org before the 
http://zeniv.linux.org.uk/~alan/IDE
patches?
If I ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support\PROMISE PDC202{68|69|70|71|75|76|77} support:
Y
Then the kernel find the controllers, but uses that failing driver rather
than the SCSI/PATA driver.  Yea, well duhh.  So I can't turn that on.
