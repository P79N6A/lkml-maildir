Try distributing your data over several disks; for example, put the /usr and
/home
on seperate disks from /.  Furthermore, if you can add more IDE cards or
more SCSI cards and distribute the
drives over the interfaces, you'll win even more.
My experience with Linux (and more generally, any PC OS) is that when you're
doing lots of disk I/O on the drive that holds the system files, you see
near total loss of responsiveness.
For example, while untarring a large (1G) file to the system disk, I can't
even telnet into my box.  It holds at the "
Connection established".    If I hit ^Z to stop the tar job, the telnet
immediately finishes the connection!
However, I recently had a chance to move all the data to seperate disk, and
did some experimenting.
When untarring on the seperate disk, the system still maintained full
responsiveness (it was a bit slower,
IE a short delay for each typed character).  I could telnet in and run jobs
without any trouble.
I've seen this with: IRIX, Solaris, Tru64, Linux, Win98, and WinNT (the OS's
I use regularly).
