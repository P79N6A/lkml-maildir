No, my previous rework based on your patches (2.6.19) had this
jerky behavior. I was obliged to go back to old style timers.
On this build, with the htimer framework, it seems ok.

Well, on the ads7843, this command allow to put converter in low power
mode and, more important, enable the PENIRQ (otherwise disabled).
The REF_OFF command can be replaced by the PWRDOWN one (exactly the
same command). This last name matches better the ads7843
datasheet description (and seems ok considering the ads7846 one).
