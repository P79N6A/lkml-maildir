The d2 vs d3 is determined by chipset in advance -- powermacs and some 
thinkpads use d2, and everyone else uses d3.
On resume, we check that same flag, and restore differently.  We only 
checked the config space on D3 resume, and restored everything if the 
first byte was trashed..   
If I understand what you're saying correctly, if we re-write a valid set
of pci registers, we'll trash the radeon state?   Why _wouldn't_ a D3 
resume be trashed?
