Subject: Re: [PATCH] reserve end-of-conventional-memory to 1MB on 32-bit v2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch adds explicit detection of the EBDA and reservation
of the rom and adapter address space 0xa0000-0x100000 to the
i386 kernels. Before this patch, the EBDA size was hardcoded
as 4Kb. Also, the reservation of the adapter range was done by
modifying the e820 map which is now not necessary any longer,
and that code is removed from copy_e820_map.
The amount of conventional memory and the start of the EBDA are
detected by reading the BIOS data area directly. Paravirtual
environments do not provide this area, so we bail out early
in that case. They will just have to set up a correct memory
map to start with.

Hi Ingo,
This is the second attempt at a i386-version of the ebda
patch. I hope that one of the Xen people will be able to
check that this does not break their setups, but I think
it will be fine after their patch to exclude the 0x9f000-
0x100000 area explicitly in their setup.
Greetings,
    Alexander
