Right, but it seems there are these 2 main suspects here...

You've written vanilla -rc6 is OK. Does it mean -rc6 with these fixes?
I think it would be easier just to start with this working -rc6 and
simply check if we have 'right' suspects, so: git-net.patch and
git-nfsd.patch from -mm1-broken-out, as suggested by Herbert (I hope,
can compile - otherwise you could try the other way: add the whole -mm
and revert these two). Using current gits could complicate this
"investigation".

So, you mean there are no more of these?:
"looked into the log in question and the only other warning was a
 circular locking dependency that lockdep detected around 1.5 hour
 before this warning."

Right, the list corruption could be because of use after freeing too.

I didn't read all this thread, so probably I miss many points, but are
you sure there are no problems with filesystem corruption around these
packets or where you compile(?) them (e.g. after these raid problems)?

Fine! I'll try to look at this. BTW, I guess/hope DEBUG_SLAB etc. are
also on...
