I don't know about these errors.  If I had one of these,
what I would do is build a kernel with USB support and
with the "newer" Gate A20 code that I sent to you last week
and put that kernel onto a boot floppy or CD, or put
it onto the NetVista hard disk (yes, take it out of the NV
and connect it to a working Linux system, put the kernel
on it, and then put it back into the NV), then boot with
this kernel.
HTH.
