Assuming the firmware of the card is written with a modicum of clue,
this is true. It's not clear how valid that assumption is, in the
general case. There are reports of cards behaving as if they have almost
no wear levelling at all.

This would be extremely useful, yes. I've said in the past that I want
this for the benefit of the purely software flash translation layers
(FTL, NFTL etc.). I hadn't realised that CF cards expose the same
functionality.
