Yes, harder.  I'm hoping that sampling of /proc/pid/io can be used to
determine pagecache use sufficiently accurately.  I know of one large
hosting company who are using it ("BTW, we are making great use of
taskstats!!  Its GREAT!")

I guess we have static analysis versus dynamic.  The interfaces which Matt
is proposing are suited to answering the question "what is my memory being
used for" (static).  They're unlikely to be useful for answering the question
"what's happening in the VM" (dynamic).  Systemtap is probably better for the
dynamic analysis.
I guess one could generate an answer to the static question with systemtap,
by accumulating running counts across the application lifetime and then
snapshotting them.  Sounds hard though.
