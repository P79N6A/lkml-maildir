When you not compile in the SKGE network driver does everything else work?
skge supports 64bit DMA, so it shouldn't use any IOMMU.  But I'm somewhat
suspicious of the >4GB support in the VIA chipset. We had problems with
that before. It's possible that it's just not supported in the hardware
or that the BIOS sets up the MTRRs wrong.
