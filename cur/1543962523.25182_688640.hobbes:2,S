The "#ifdef CONFIG_HARD_PPS" is currently into kernel code, is *not*
my modification at all. In fact you can find the flag UPF_HARDPPS_CD
defined into include/linux/serial_core.h. It's a part of a very old
PPS implemention (never merged into mainline) and it was used to
enable the PPS layer for serial ports. That's why I didn't define an
ldisc but implemented my PPS version using it. :)
Ciao,
Rodolfo
