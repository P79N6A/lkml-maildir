Yes, that's when you view it as a locking problem, as for data
objects. What I'm saying is that, if you manage the data
structures properly, plus fix a few interfaces that currently
don't have to manage data structures properly, you're already
perfectly synchronized, so no further locking is needed.

Yes.

Alas, no. But we how long can we afford not to fix them, at least
the "public" interfaces ? Even if they're unsafe, people will use
them, particularly if they're given no other choice.

It's more the changes behind the interfaces I'm worried about.
It may not be bad today, but every function pointer is a
potential problem.
Anyway, without fixing a good number of the "ghost from the
past" interfaces first, my point is moot. So I won't trouble
you again with module locking before there is some progress in
this area :-)

Nah, don't give up ! :-)
