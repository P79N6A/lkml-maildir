hi, 
what i am missing is a kind of information, what type of pc you own/use.
i personally builded a new one the last few days and also encountered
problems with ext3.
i do own a amd64 x2 5000+ with asus m2n32 ws pro motherboard.
i yesterday changed my root partition from ext3 to xfs and my problems
went away. so imho there might be some issues in having 64 bit systems,
dual processor and ext3 in combination.
kernel is 2.6.17
behaviour was like: 
filesystem became corrupted due to uncommitted transactions, resulting 
in manually "fsck" checking the partition, loads of errors i did correct, but
a lot of files got corrupted. i didn't check if the sata attached drives would also
fail on ext3 cause i had them already prepared for xfs.
