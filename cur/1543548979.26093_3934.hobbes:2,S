Btw, do you know /why/ this was the case?
I have a strong hunch this was because you moved some swap-out
pages out of the way of the rest of the pages on the LRU list.
The new VM, as integrated in -test9-pre1, does the same thing,
only for a lot more cases than your classzone patch did, achieving
the same effect, only stronger and effective in more different
situations.
Add to that page aging, and the drop-behind code that makes it
possible to do streaming IO without putting memory pressure on
the working set ....
(well, not in all cases ... drop_behind() and read-ahead don't
work for mmap() yet)
regards,
Rik
