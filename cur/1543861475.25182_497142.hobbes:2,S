I also see an annoying side effect of this bug. When the panic
happens, the caps lock LED starts to blink, and the kernel prints this
on the console once every second (or more often, don't know exactly):
	printk(KERN_WARNING "atkbd.c: Spurious %s on %s. "
	       "Some program might be trying access hardware directly.\n",
	       data == ATKBD_RET_ACK ? "ACK" : "NAK", serio->phys);
This makes the actual crash information disappear before you have a
chance to read it.
