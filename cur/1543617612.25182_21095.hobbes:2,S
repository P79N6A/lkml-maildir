btw: I get some warning messages when I compile arpd 1.0.4 on 2.4.*
kernel. just wondering if this might also contribute to the problem.
root@lx-master:~/arpd-1.0.4# make
gcc -O6 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -Wall -DARPD_VERSION=\"1.0.4\"
arpd.c   -o arpd
arpd.c: In function `arpd_walk_procfs':
arpd.c:272: warning: long unsigned int format, unsigned int arg (arg 4)
root@lx-master:~/arpd-1.0.4# ls -la arpd

arpd.c: line 266-274
void arpd_walk_procfs(struct arpd_request * request, void * foo)
{
        struct in_addr inaddr;
 inaddr.s_addr = request->ip;
 fprintf(stderr, "Tbl: %s (%08lx)\n",
  inet_ntoa(inaddr), ntohl(request->ip));
 return;
