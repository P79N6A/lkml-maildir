Yeah, it suffers from other problems though. It uses an LD_PRELOAD hack to 
intercept library calls that open the /dev/dsp devices etc.. This doesn't 
always work.
I suppose the best way to provide OSS emu is to use something like FUSD 
[similar to the OSS2JACK package] [1] to provide the OSS device files and 
then redirect to user space, so all ALSA pcm devices can be used.. Sadly FUSD 
doesn't really get actively developed anymore it seems. And FUSE can't handle 
ioctls.
