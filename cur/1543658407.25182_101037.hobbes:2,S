I'm about to implement rotation which is needed for devices like the ipaq. 
The question is do we flip the xres and yres values depending on the 
rotation or do we just alter the data that will be drawn to make the 
screen appear to rotate. How does hardware rotate view the x and y axis?
Are they rotated or does just the data get rotated?
