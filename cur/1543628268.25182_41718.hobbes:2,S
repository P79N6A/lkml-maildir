Does Ivan's patch look ok to you, Urban?  I'd like to get your initial
sign-off on it.  From a quick look, it looks ok to me.
And yes, you are correct:  my preference would be to receive two
submissions in my inbox:  Shing Chuang's patch, and then Ivan's patch
(less Shing's work).
If there are multiple issues, multiple patches are encouraged.  More
split-up is always better than less.  :)
