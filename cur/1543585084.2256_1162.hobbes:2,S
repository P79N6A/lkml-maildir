Original - typo, the rest (including "rule...are") - not ;-)
Seriously, binfmt_misc.c was written in rather, erm, interesting C.
Read it and you'll see. Just one (but rather impressive) example:
        if ((count == 1) && !(buffer[0] & ~('0' | '1'))) {
It was meant to be
        if (count == 1 && (buffer[0] == '0' || buffer[0] == '1')) {
and anyone who can't find the difference really should learn C. And
that's not the only bogosity of such level. Besides, the thing is
trivially oopsable - write() to any file in binfmt_misc with buffer
pointing to unmapped kernel address and you are screwed,
