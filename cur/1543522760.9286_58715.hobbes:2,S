I get 33MHz from /proc/ide/ali. AFAICT there are no jumpers on my MB for 
setting this.

I tried this, briefly, under a light I/O load, after a full-backup of my
root disc. It worked with the Maxtor 90680D4 HD going into UDMA at boot 
time. I did get lots of CRC errors, eg.
Jan 19 19:51:15 mklab kernel: hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error } 
Jan 19 19:51:15 mklab kernel: hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC } 
I turned on some of the other optimisations with,
hdparm -c 1 -d 1 -m 16 -u 1 -a 8 
and get the following messages (presumably due to the m16??)
Jan 19 19:57:42 mklab kernel: hda: multwrite: count=8, current=0 
Jan 19 19:58:22 mklab last message repeated 53 times
Jan 19 19:59:23 mklab last message repeated 115 times
The root FS checked-out OK after this expt.
Here are some disc timing results.
With UDMA turned on the Maxtor gives,
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  2.97 seconds =43.10 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  5.95 seconds =10.76 MB/sec
Turning it off gives,
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  3.18 seconds =40.25 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 12.17 seconds = 5.26 MB/sec
Turning on the other enhancements (hdparm, as above)
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  3.04 seconds =42.11 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  6.17 seconds =10.37 MB/sec
Turning off the hack and returning to MWDMA gives,
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  3.07 seconds =41.69 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 11.76 seconds = 5.44 MB/sec
Staying with MWDMA and turning on the other optimisations gives,
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  3.12 seconds =41.03 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 10.41 seconds = 6.15 MB/sec
If it is safe to run the Maxtor in UDMA, is there a recommended patch for the 
CRC errors? - something in ide.c? Any comments on the 'multwrite' diagnostics - 
Are these benign?
Best Regards
Tom.
