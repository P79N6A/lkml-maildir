I see what you mean. What do you suggest should be done in the context of
the driver? As you can easily tell, I'm not overly familiar with the 
internal workings of the kernel. That and the mere impossibility to get 
any kind of help at the mere mention of the Nvidia driver module ("go bitch
at nvidia", "who cares", ...) do not exactly make it easier to fix problems 
that arise from changes to the kernel.
