User-process virtual addresses have no direct relation to physical
addresses, right? So why does the process space start at such a high virtual
address (why not closer to 0x00000000)? Seems we're wasting ~128 megs of
RAM. Not a huge amount compared to 4G, but signifigant. Is that space used
(libc can't be that big!) or reserved somehow?
Another question: how (and where in the code) do we translate virtual
user-addresses to physical addresses? Does the MMU do it, or does it call a
kernel handler function? Why is the kernel allowed to reference physical
addresses, while user processes go through the translation step? Can kernel
pages be swapped out / faulted in just like user process pages?
Sorry to pounce on you with all of these questions. I've read up on this
stuff but can't always find answers...
thanks--
