They can't write over the same page at the same time though. Anyway I am
not sure if this is correct or not.
I seen also another problem of this kind. We may have a reader that will
read data in copy_to_user, while a writer is in the middle of the
copy_from_user. To avoid this we need a kind of read locking over the page
that may be shared by all readers.

True, i_size is still protected only by the big kernel lock so this patch
follows:
