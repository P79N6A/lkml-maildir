Main point is that in many enviroments the niced processes
are the ones the system exists for in the first place.
 I.e they are the most important ones.
 It would be completely unacceptable, say in research enviroment I know,
if my computational job will be killed because somebody launches Netscape or
some interactive game.  The OS which does this is then will not be considered
suitable
for research.
Niced processes are usually the most complex one organizationally, and quite
often
are fairly complex to launch (not just click a button on your Gnome panel).
 Moreover background niced  processes by definition
are typically run  unattended so need to relaunch has yet to be detected.
I, for example, typically lauch sequence of simulations
simultaniously on 20 Alphas running Linux, which then run for 3-4 days.
So yes, I do care that simulations are not killed after 5 minutes.
because, first I have to notice this (or write and run monitoring program),
second I have
to find what was exactly run on this specific machine which was killed and so
on.

Well,  at the given CPU time spent, the niced process used much more real
time
than unniced.  So the loss in terms of human hours is larger when it is
killed.
It shows quickly when you have some deadline to meet.    Believe it is not
pleasant
to come in the morning and find the simulations you launched overnight
disappeared.
The day you planned on spending analysis the output results is gone.
