Consider this:
get_free_page() returns a zeroed page. __get_free_page() returns a page.
Both names are readable. What is the benefit of doing
  page = get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL);
  if (!page)
     /* failed */  
  .. use page ..
  free_page(page);
rather than:
  page = __get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL);
  if (!page)
      /* failed */
  clear_page((void *)page);
  ... use page ...
  free_page(page);
You do agree that the first form is more readable although it wastes an
extra if() (one is done inside get_free_page()), don't you? Therefore, for
the same reason it is more readable to use kzalloc() in cases where you
would do kmalloc()/memset(). What is the difference? (other than the fact
that I made it a function instead of a macro or inline as Ingo correctly
pointed out).
Regards,
Tigran.
