It occurred with 2.2.8. Sorry that I don't recall where I ran tcpdump, but I 
saw NFS packets flowing so they certainly made it past the stack on the server 
side down to the card level. I still have 2.2.8 in the client's lilo.conf, so 
if you have specific tests you want me to run, drop me a note.

Hmm. Probably need to refine my Deja search technique. Don't worry about your 
tone, I was raised in the Rotterdam harbour area and have an extremely thick 
skin ;-)
