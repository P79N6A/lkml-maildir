I'm not sure that you need *either* one.
As far as I'm aware, REQ_SOFTBARRIER is used when feeding requests
into the top of the block layer, and is used to guarantee the device
driver gets the requests in a specific ordering.
When dealing with the requests at the other end (ie.
elevator_next_req_fn, blk_requeue_request), then ordering does not
change.
That is - if you call elevator_next_req_fn and don't dequeue the
request, then that's the same request you'll get next time.
And blk_requeue_request will push the request back onto the end of
the queue in a LIFO manner.
So I think adding barriers, apart from not doing anything, confuses
the issue because it suggests there *could* be reordering without
them.
Or am I completely wrong? It's been a while since I last got into
the code.
