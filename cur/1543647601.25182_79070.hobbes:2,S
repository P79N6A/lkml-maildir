AFAIK, iBCS use these syscalls to emulate TLI, and iBCS
only has this emulation working for the IP protocol suite.
LiS is hooking the same syscalls, and is more protocol
independent.
In this way, iBCS and LiS are competing projects, even
if their base objectives are very different (iBCS aims
for user-level binary portability from SysV, while LiS
aims for kernel-level STREAMS code portability from SysV
to extend to Linux).

An LGPL module with proprietary code linked into it will
taint the kernel. LiS is often linked with proprietary
code, since it is under LGPL.
IMHO, A not-GPL-only export from the kernel is needed
here.
That will not make these syscalls proprietary. Even with
proprietary drivers linked into LiS, it is impossible to
deviate from the SysV definition of putpmsg/getpmsg
unless the code of LiS itself is modified.
