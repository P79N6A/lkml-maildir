Don't see why.  drm 4.1 uses a sane makefile, apart from a few dead
references to $(lib) which do nothing.  The separate copy of drmlib in
each object was meant to allow migration to a new format, it obviously
failed in its task, drm 4.1 is not compatible.  From drm 4.0 Makefile
# The upside is that if the DRM support library ever becomes insufficient
# for new families of cards, a new library can be implemented for those new
# cards without impacting the drivers for the old cards.  This is significant,
# because testing architectural changes to old cards may be impossible, and
# may delay the implementation of a better architecture.  We've traded slight
# memory waste (in the dual-head case) for greatly improved long-term
# maintainability.
Nice definition of long term, it survived 0 new releases.  Kill it.
