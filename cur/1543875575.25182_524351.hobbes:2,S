Oh, I just read the patch, not apply it to my local tree, I'm working
on 2.6.19 now.
So the question is, when vfs pagecache limit is hit, the current
implementation just reclaim few pages, so it's quite possible the
limit is hit again, and hence the reclaim code will be called again
and again, that will impact application performance.
