Here's where what Andi said about being able to get the pt_regs stuff
off the stack (I think that's what he said at least) started to confuse
me slightly.  But if I understand it right (and I never got around to
testing this) we can replace the do_schedule() stuffs at least with
something like kgdb_get_pt_regs(), since (and I lost my notes on this,
so it's probably not quite right) (thread_info->esp0)-1
