Subject: [patch] potential race in epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_MOD) ...

Andrew, a potential race can happen in epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_MOD) where an 
event can happen in between f_op->poll() and the lock on ep->lock (we 
cannot call f_op->poll() inside a lock, and the f_op->poll() callback does 
not carry any info at the current time - missing wake_up_info() already ;).
In that case the event would be removed. We can easily leave the event 
inside the ready list and have the ep_send_events() logic do the job for 
us at later time.
(Thanks to david.lee@teracruz.com for reporting the thing, since it 
shouldn't have been a nice one ;)
