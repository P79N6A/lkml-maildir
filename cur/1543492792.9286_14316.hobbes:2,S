Yes, that would probably be the best idea.  I think there are more
important issues in kernel development than trying to include support
for losemodems.  If there is to be support for it, it should be
userspace, not kernel space.  My personal opinion, for what it's worth,
is that we should boycott losemodems, and refuse them even on prebuilts.
I.e., demand quality for the money we shell out to vendors.
I don't think it would be a bad thing to develop a module, separate from
the kernel, though, for those poor souls stuck with one of those idiotic
modems, and too broke to buy a decent one.  But it *should* be separate,
like some others that I use (e.g., lm_sensors.o), especially if it's not
going to be distributed with the source code.
