See, the direction really doesn't matter for the sync ops.
If you flush the cpu caches at MAP time, and your PCI controller doesn't
have DMA caching or something like that, then sync for CPU can always be
a nop.  You will have always previously flushed the cpu caches before
giving the buffer back to the device, either via MAP or sync for device
calls.
So basically, make MAP and sync for device writeback flush the cpu caches.
