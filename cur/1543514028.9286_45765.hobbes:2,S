If this address was get via ip_route_input() it gives no useful
information for masquerading, certainly.

Right.
Though it could use the information received from ip_route_input() optionally
(copying the piece of code chacking RTCF_MASQ from 2.2 ip_forward()),
it does not contradict netfilter paradigm, faster a bit and, seems,
more convenient. At least, IP is aware of not sending redirects etc.
in this case. With firewall rules user has to filter out redirects
manually. Or did you solve the last problem for NAT/MASQ inside corresponding
modules?

I apologize, I am lazy to dig in netfilter now, but, please, tell me one thing:
does netfilter have facility to masquerade to fixed address or not yet? 8)8)

Good surprises are good. 8)
