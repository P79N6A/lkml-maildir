Zero _is_ an appropriate choice, dammit!
That NO_IRQ thing should be zero, and any architecture that thinks that 
zero is a valid IRQ just needs to fix its own irq mapping so that the 
"cookie" doesn't work.
The thing is, it's zero. Get over it. It can't be "-1" or some other 
random value like people have indicated, because that thing is often read 
from places where "-1" simply isn't a possible value (eg it gets its 
default value initialized from a "unsigned char" in MMIO space on x86).
So instead of making everybody and their dog to silly things with some 
NO_IRQ define that they haven't historically done, the rule is simple: "0" 
means "no irq", so that you can test for it with obvious code like
	if (!dev->irq)
		..
and then, if your actual _hardware_ things that the bit-pattern with all 
bits clear is a valid irq that can be used for normal devices, then what 
you do is you add a irq number translation layer (WHICH WE NEED AND HAVE 
_ANYWAY_) and make sure that nobody sees that on a _software_ level.
