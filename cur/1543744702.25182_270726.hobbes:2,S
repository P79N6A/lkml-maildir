This is exactly what we want to happen, if AGP is there, DRM should use it
no matter what, and if AGP is a module, DRM has to be... it isn't pretty
maybe but I think the DRM-AGP relationship is rather complicated, I'm
probably going to add some output to the drm init string to say whether it
knows about AGP or not ...
