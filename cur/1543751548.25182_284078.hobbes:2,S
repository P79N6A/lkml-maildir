capabilities work - we use them in 2.4 where a helper suid application
gets the ball rolling, and then its child grants capabilities to new
clients. 
the problem we have with capabilities is that capabilities are not
enabled by default in the vanilla kernel, and there seems to be
considerable advice suggesting that they should not be enabled.
