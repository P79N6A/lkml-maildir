The incentive for the aic7xx maintainer is that he do detect if a 
warning happens before actually shipping a patch.
Same goes for alpha and sparc64, I recall both David and Richard
wanted to achieve the same goal.
[Wondering if kbuild could do something smart here...]
During the 2.4 series Linus added -Werror to CFLAGS in the top-level
makefile, simply to put more focus on warnings. If was only momentarily
but a lot af patches showed up removing the source of the errors.
The dense output from kbuild these days makes warnings much more
visible, and if you follow John Cherry nice statistics you can see that
the number of warnings generally decrease for each new kernel release.
