Cute :-)
Here is my bisect log so far, with 98 revisions left. Note that all kernels have the XFS workqueue patch applied.

The bad kernels exhibit the hang on second resume from RAM.
The "good" ones all have the artifact with corrupted display. Moreover, they resume immediately from every suspend to RAM _after_ a suspend-to-disk, but not before it. This is when suspending with "echo mem > /sys/power/state".
