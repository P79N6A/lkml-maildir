For the Xth time, where do you get kernel 2.2.20 ?! The current 2.2
version is 2.2.13 !  The last time you were talking about kernel 2.2.15,
which doesn't exist either.

For the Xth time, there is NO support for the PRO version of the eicon

What's the point of responding to your questions if you don't read the
