Jean-Pierre noticed, that it's possible to access any task through
/proc/<tid>/, not just the thread group leader.
Is this intentional?  I can't find it documented anywhere, but it's
definitely a useful feature.  So maybe it's worth making it officially
part of the kernel interface, and adding a note to
Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt?
