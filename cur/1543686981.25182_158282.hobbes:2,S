Because on some SGI ia64 platforms the need to allow a different range
for consistent_dma_mask than they do for the normal dma_mask.
The ia64 support code to do things with consistent_dma_mask just isn't

Because the other platforms don't to do anything special wrt. this
they can just ignore consitent_dma_mask altogether.
