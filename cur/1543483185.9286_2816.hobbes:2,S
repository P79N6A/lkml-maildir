Just thought I'd throw in a thought here.
It's probable that 80 percent of the kernel source is used be 20 percent
of the linux community.  So much as splitting the kernel in two halves
would make a few people happy.  One half would contain the core and the
most used stuff, the other would contain stuff like ISDN etc. Some
Makefile/config magic would make the first half work with or without the
other half.
Having said that, I would have no idea how to actually do it. :)
Mick, who can't type the percent sign because he fscked up some xmodmap
commands...
