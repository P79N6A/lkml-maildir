It is not about the size, it is about source separation. Since it has
nothing to do with actualy loading of a BLOB from userspace to kernel
space I'd put it into lib/, like crc functions, etc. It does not
really have to work with "struct firmware *", "void *data, size_t len"
should be just as useable.
