OpenFirmware is quite knowledgeable about USB devices, both disks,  
mice, keyboards, and IIRC there's even a USB<=>serial bridge useable  
as an OpenFirmware console.

On other platforms, OpenFirmware supports direct ELF loading without  
any extra code.  If you want initrd support, you need a little Forth  
script (IE: yaboot) to load it into some RAM first.
The difference is, OpenFirmware is nice and clean and stops messing  
with hardware before handing off to the new kernel.  If you ever try  
to boot from an invalid ELF file on an OpenFirmware machine, you'll  
see that's fairly obvious, because the screen flashes and changes  
state slightly during the failed boot attempt (after which it  
reconnects to the hardware again to display messages).
Why should x86-specific-BIOS-USB-handoff-specific-crap-PCI-quirks be  
even _compiled_ on PowerPC systems that have nothing remotely like  
the affected hardware (BIOS & PS/2 serio chip)?
Cheers,
