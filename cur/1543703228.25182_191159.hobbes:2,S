All,
A new version of the 8.x series driver for Linux 2.6.x kernels has
been uploaded to SourceForge:
	
http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-qla2xxx/
Changes from previous release (8.00.00b8) include:
	o Merge several patches from Christoph Hellwig:
	  - IOCTL code optional and split from main code.
	  - Simplify wait routines used for MBX commands and IOCTLS.
	o Add full support for three new ISP chips - ISP2322, ISP6312,
	  and ISP6322.
	  - The increased size of the distribution tarball is a result
	    of the three new firmwares needed to support the chips.
Review the revision notes for further details of the changes in
8.00.00b9.
Regards,
Andrew Vasquez
