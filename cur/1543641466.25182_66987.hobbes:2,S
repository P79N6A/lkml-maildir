FYI: My booting problems are now solved.  Thanks to help from Robert
Schwebel, I replaced the setup.S in my 2.4.19 with the setup.S from my
2.4.13 tree and the system booted.  So, there was some change in
setup.S that is incompatible with my system.  I'll post more info if
and when I find it.
I haven't tested paging, but audio ripping still fails.  But at least
I have the hope to work on recent kernel source.
Dan.
