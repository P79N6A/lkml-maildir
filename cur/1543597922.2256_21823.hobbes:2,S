Actually, AFAIK you _may_ get entropy from the IDE interrupts directly
(I didn't check), but you also appear to get entropy from block I/O
completions as well.  I _thought_ I had seen such lines in IDE, DAC960,
and also in the SCSI midlayer, but then I wasn't paying much attention
to those - I was trying to track down the interrupts for net devices.
If it is NOT in the SCSI block I/O layer, it should probably be added.
Whether it makes sense to have entropy from both the block layer and
the actual device IRQs is an issue left up to the security experts (it
may have correlation, and not be good entropy).
Cheers, Andreas
