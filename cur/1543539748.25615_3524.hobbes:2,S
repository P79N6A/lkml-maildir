	Default the jumper in the other direction then.  Then those
that are clueful can protect themselves if they feel it neccessary
and the rest don't have to worry about it.  Of course, the first
time a virus comes through and blows away everything the vendors may
perhaps change their mind.  Of course, this hasn't happened in any
of the many years this ability has been around so I'm not sure there
is exactly much cause for alarm.
