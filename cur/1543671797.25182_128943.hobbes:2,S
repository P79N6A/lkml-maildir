Things like OpenOffice _do_ busy loop on sched_yield().  It appears with
that patch, OO will sit there chewing ~1% of CPU.  Not great, but not bad
either..
A few kernels ago, OpenOffice would take sixty seconds to just flop down a
menu if there was a kernel build happening at the same time.  That is just
utterly broken, so if we're going to leave the sched.c code as-is then we
*require* that all applications be updated to not spin on sched_yield.
There's just no question about that.  It may end up not being acceptable.
Has anyone looked at what Andrea did in -aa?  I assume some suitable
compromise was achieved there.
