That sounds good for me. Breaking with what was there is not a problem
as long as this feature is still there, it can be done in a more clean
way this way, and the new  /sys/foo/bar path is documented (basically
people nowadays expect slight user interface changes between kernel
versions).

I guess this warning is not too useful, except if it is triggered on
echo  >/sys/*/pb_fnmode too (which I suspect is what most people do).
