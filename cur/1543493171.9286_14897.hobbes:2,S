insmod: /lib/modules/2.2.6/fs/msdos.o: unresolved symbol is_binary
Mounting msdos filesystems fails in 2.2.6 because there is an unresolved
symbol is_binary in msdos.o module. I am tracking down the problem right
now and barring patches being posted, I shall post a patch in here in due
course.
Cheers, 
Alex
