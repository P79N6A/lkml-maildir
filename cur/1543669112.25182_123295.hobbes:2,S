Are you sure this is working? When I'm watching a video ofer NFS on my
machine which is idle (just X and mplayer, gnome in background, 256 MB
of memory, 512 swap), after 30 minutes or so, the playback starts to
jump. The cpu usage is below 10%, and it even does this when both X and
mplayer are renice to -19 (!). So the VM swapped everything out and
after 30 minutes it starts to swap out X oder mplayer itself, which is
immediately swapped back in but the video jumps... :-(
