Subject: Asking about Unbuffer I/O in linux

I met a problem which need me to use unbuffered I/O in linux.  The problem
is related to hard disk I/O. 
When I read from the Linux buffer cache,  the other system may write new
data to the hard disk, while
the Linux buffer cache doesnot know it.  So I try to find if there are some
methods to disable the buffer
function, then to  make read directly from the disk.  But when I went
through the document and kernel 
source code( redhat 2.2.11), I could only find one function or flag to flush
the buffer cache, which is 
in "ioctl" for the flag BLKFLSBUF. But it is so time-costing that I have to
find another way.  Could you
give me some instructions on this issue?  Thanks a lot.
