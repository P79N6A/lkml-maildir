OK. If people really want to track this, then you could add a reference
to the current->nsproxy to the struct rpc_cred and struct auth_cred, and
ensure that the unx_marshal and unx_match routines do the right thing
w.r.t. that reference (if it exists).
However such a patch had better be accompanied with a _really_
convincing argument for why containers need this...
As for the NFSv4 clientid, I can't see how you would ever want to use
anything other than the init->utsname(), since the requirement is only
that the clientid string be unique and preserved across reboots. The
server isn't allowed to interpret the contents of the clientid string.
Ditto for the RPCSEC_GSS machine creds that are used to establish the
clientid.
