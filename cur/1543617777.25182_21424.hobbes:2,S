It *is* printed:
From lib/interface.c (net-tools 1.60):
    if (hw->print != NULL && (! (hw_null_address(hw, ptr->hwaddr) &&
                  hw->suppress_null_addr)))
    printf(_("HWaddr %s  "), hw->print(ptr->hwaddr));
#ifdef IFF_PORTSEL
    if (ptr->flags & IFF_PORTSEL) {
    printf(_("Media:%s"), if_port_text[ptr->map.port][0]);
    if (ptr->flags & IFF_AUTOMEDIA)
        printf(_("(auto)"));
    }
#endif
    printf("\n");
So, something has set IFF_PORTSEL, and ptr->map.port is not within bounds.
Or you have a kernel which does not support IFF_PORTSEL, but something
else is using ptr->flags with different values...
