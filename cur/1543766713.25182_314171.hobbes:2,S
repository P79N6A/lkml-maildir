Please submit in proper format, including corrected
file name level (begin at linux/drivers/net/tulip/....).
See Documentation/SubmittingPatches,

 , and
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt
then send it to jgarzik@pobox.com and netdev@oss.sgi.com, please.
Alternatively, you can try kernel-janitors if Rusty is not
responding...  (see
