Hello.
I tried gcc 4.1.2 on Fedora 8 using
http://I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp/tmp/config-2.6.24-rc8-mm1
 .
Same result as gcc 3.3.5 on Debian/Sarge.
It seems kernel config (and possibly hardware) dependent
rather than gcc version dependent.
This is VMware workstation 6.0.0 on Thinkpad X60 (Core 2 Duo).
Regards.
