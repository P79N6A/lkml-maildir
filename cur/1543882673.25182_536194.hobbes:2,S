I have compiled v2.6.21 with git-mmc.patch of v2.6.21-rc7.mm2.
After [tifm_sd] is loaded. My smoke test script at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=11240&action=view
reliably hangs suspend.
I didn't even see a failure for 'modprove -r tifm', which
doesn't exist in this build.
I will try to bisect git-mmc.patch to locate the source of
trouble. And I will compile my version to check it against
-mm tree.
