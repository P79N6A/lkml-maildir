The idea I'm currently kicking around is having an array of spinlocks
and list heads per CPU and add an array index to the SLOB page struct.
To allocate, we loop over the array starting at the current CPU
looking for space. On failure, we add a page to the current CPU's
list. We can imagine several variants here: attempting to trylock
while scanning the list or doing no fallback at all. The first is
liable to be unhelpful if there's actually contention, the second will
consume more total memory but reduce the average scan time.
To free, we locate the list from the page struct so we can grab the
relevant lock.
This probably also ends up being very friendly to NUMA. But it's not
clear that it's worth doing for the common case of 2 cores, where
contention may be too low to be worth the extra trouble.

It's all handwaving until there are actually benchmarks.
