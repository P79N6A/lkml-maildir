Oh, this patchset also (mostly) cures my pet hate for the
last few months: VolanoMark on the NUMA.
http://www.kerneltrap.org/~npiggin/w26/vmark.html
The "average" plot for w26 I think is a little misleading because
it got an unlucky result on the second last point making it look
like its has a downward curve. It is usually more linear with a
sharp downward spike at 150 rooms like the "maximum" plot.
Don't ask me why it runs out of steam at 150 rooms. hackbench does
something similar. I think it might be due to some resource running
short, or a scalability problem somewhere else.
