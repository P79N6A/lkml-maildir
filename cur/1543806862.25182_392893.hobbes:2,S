I see the same thing with, the only external kernel patch I have
applied is Suspend2. The ATA scanbus code tries to 
open("/dev/hda", O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK|O_EXCL) and that fails, and since
the scanning code stops once one device fails to open the whole scan
aborts. Apparently O_EXCL was added by Ubuntu and Debian to stop
burns being corrupted by hald polling the device while a disc is
being burned. If you want to read the entire thread it's bug #262678
in Debian.
