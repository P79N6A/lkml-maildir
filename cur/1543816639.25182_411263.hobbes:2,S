Linus,
There are two things that really count:
  1) the identifier (preferably a world wide unique name)
     of the logical unit that is being addressed
  2) a topological description of how that logical unit
     is connected
For the last 25 years various OS SCSI subsystems have used
variants of 2) as a proxy for 1). Modern SCSI disks (and
soon SATA disks) have a world wide unique name associated
with their logical unit.
So why are modern SCSI standards full of terms like
I_T_L ** and I_T_L_Q nexus? Probably because the topology,
especially when there are multiple paths to the same
logical unit, is significant.
Linux's <hctl> may be a ham fisted way of describing
a path through a topology, but it easily beats /dev/sdabc
and /dev/sg4711 .
With a device node name like /dev/sdabc, a SCSI INQUIRY or
an ATA IDENTIFY DEVICE command can be sent to ascertain 1)
but I am unaware of any command sent to a logical unit that
will yield 2).
** that is: the nexus of an Initiator port, a Target port
   and a Logical unit number.
