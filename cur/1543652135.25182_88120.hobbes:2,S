Er, we clear VM_MAYWRITE...

It's a read-only mapping. Whether it's shared or private is not relevant,
surely, since those affect only the behaviour if we write to it -- which we 
can't. 
I don't _really_ want a shared mapping; all I want is for the fsx-linux
stress test to run, and find interesting breakage on my file system to keep
me from getting bored (what are Friday nights for, after all?).
As shipped, fsx-linux uses PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED on its test file, which
definitely needs to be opened for write. For now, I've just changed it to
use MAP_PRIVATE. I'm just a bit concerned about having to change the test to
get it to work though, and don't see why a _readonly_ mmap should fail due 
to lack of writepage.
