I think it's working extremely well. When it comes to security fixes, I want 
them as soon as possible. There's no sense batching them.
The only thing to be careful of is that -stable fixes (or complete reworks) 
get merged with mainline, so the trees don't go out of sync. So far this 
seems to have been OK.
