I'm afraid it is to be expected. They have to go through the
motions of setting DEBUG. Unfortunately, it's not all that
simple. Messages scroll up and since the keyboard is dead,
they cannot be returned with Shift-PgUp. I used a serial console.
I think it's more effort most people are prepared to spend.
