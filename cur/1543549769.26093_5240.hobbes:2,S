I mean removing (optionally) the PCI device info *from* __init code to
minimize the on-disk kernel image (floppy boot) and *leave* the /proc/pci
funcionality of the system.

I do not see any problem with any memory being locked. The master device
information persists in module code, which is unloaded just after use.
(IMHO, similar to __init code). Only necessary info (for really existing
devices) would be copied into kmalloc()ed kernel space. In a hotplug
device case it can be kfree()d while unplugging the device.

Maybe this would be even better as it does not do kernel locking (like
a module initializing routine). I am just not sure whether the kernel can
call such an userspace program automatically (eg. while initializing a
compiled-in hotplug device).
However, probably there's no much difference between kernel calling
modprobe -k some_module_setting_pci_info
rmmod some_module_setting_pci_info
and the same kernel calling some program, which does the same eg. via
sysctl().
Am I wrong ?
