As I noted in my first message I have this problem with the kernel
from git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6
which is currently 2.6.26-rc1 and still exhibits this behaviour.
So, this problem obviously does not exist in the 2.6.25 release kernel
but would probably hit mainline in the 2.6.26 release.
