I noticed that the overflow check in the original code is either useless or
buggy, so this patch is even more worth applying. Look below at original
code : if HZ <= 1000, the overflow is set only when
msecs_to_jiffies() >= MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT.
But the maximal value that msecs_to_jiffies() can return is MAX_JIFFY_OFFSET.
Guess what ?
  include/linux/jiffies.h:#define MAX_JIFFY_OFFSET ((~0UL >> 1)-1)
  include/linux/sched.h:#define    MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT    LONG_MAX
  include/linux/kernel.h:#define LONG_MAX  ((long)(~0UL>>1))
=> MAX_JIFFY_OFFSET == (MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT - 1)
=> So msecs_to_jiffies() cannot be >= MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT, and 'overflow'
   can never be set for HZ <= 1000.
Given how msecs_to_jiffies() is used everywhere, I wonder if we should not
provide a separate overflow detection function which would be used where
needed, and possibly remove the test from msecs_to_jiffies() which is mostly
called with constants or small delays which will never overflow.
Has anyone an opinion on this ?
Regards,
Willy
