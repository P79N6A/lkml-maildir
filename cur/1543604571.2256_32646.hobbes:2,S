IIRC, the PowerPC architecture requires that data dependencies
imply ordering (as does SPARC).  Unfortunately, I am currently >1000 km
from my PPC manual, and my eyes just aren't quite what they used to be.
I will look it up when I get back on Monday, and post my findings.
Sorry for the lack of an immediate answer!

Yep, the eieio and SYNC instructions are used to force
ordering.

Set two is all we care about for SMP locking algorithms.
People writing drivers sometimes have to worry about
set one, but they often do so by use of locks, thus
avoiding the set-one issues.

Yep!  If you map the same physical memory as coherent on one
CPU and uncached on another, you are certainly taking your
chances.  There may be a situation where doing this sort of
thing is useful, but I don't know of one.
                         Thanx, Paul
