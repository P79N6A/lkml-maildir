Hello,
I run an Adaptec 2940 UW controller under Linux 2.0.35 and the Adaptec AIC7xxx
driver version: 5.0.19/3.2.4 - I got the same error message when I upgraded to
Linux 2.0.36 and Adaptec AIC7xxx driver version: 5.1.4/3.2.4. The SCSI tape
stuff is compiled as a module.
I have several UW disks attached and a SCSI DLT tape drive which is also an UW
device. The tapedrive can write 35 GB to a single tape at a speed of more than
200 MB/min.
When I write to or read from the tape I sometimes get the following message:
Feb  7 23:51:11 hostname kernel: Detected scsi tape st0 at scsi0, channel 0, id
13, lun 0
Feb  7 23:54:42 hostname kernel: (scsi0:0:13:0) Data overrun detected in
Data-Out phase, tag 29;
Feb  7 23:54:42 hostname kernel:   Have seen Data Phase. Length=65536, NumSGs=1.
Feb  7 23:54:42 hostname kernel:      sg[0] - Addr 0x400000 : Length 65536
Feb  7 23:54:42 hostname kernel: st0: Error 27070000.
and tar responds to this with:
Prepare volume #2 for /dev/nrmt0 and hit return:
After I hit return (without changing the tape) it continues properly. The data
on the tape, at the area where this might have happened, is corrupted though.
What is this error message about ?
On another box where I have almost the same configuration but the tape connected
to a seperate controller I dont get this message and I can write non-stop to the
tape.
Any suggestions are welcome. :-)
Harry
