It seems he is using 2.4test3, but I never compiled that. So excuse 
the redirect. -- Ulrich

It seems like there is an bug in kernel/timer.c.
If I not choose to use "Symmetric multi-processing support" then it can't
compile timer.c.
It says that the variable (probably an predefined constant) DEF_PRORITY
isn't defined. Should it be defined by the command-line by Makefile or
something simular?
