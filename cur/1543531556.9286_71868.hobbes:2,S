You might wanna take a look at:

Should give you a good start. Slides not updated to use netfilter,
but that should be pretty trivial to do.
The "ip" command is very well documented by Alexey in the iproute2 package
and i doubt you can do a better job than he did. So focus on tc.

PS: use wget to grab the slides. I lost them and it seems so did
the conference organizers.
