    Nonsense.   Publish the interfaces and let timid hardware vendors
    write binary drivers to those interfaces, and eventually they'll
    realize that letting developers see the programming information
    won't hurt them.   What I want is for vendors to feel comfortable
    selling hardware to the Linux marketplace, and if this means that
    they have third-party binary only drivers for a while, that is
    *not* a cost.

    Binary third-party drivers haven't killed Windows yet;  all they do
    is create extra work for the hardware vendors, who, in the fullness
    of time, will realize that the Open(tm) Source(tm) fanatics actually
    are technically competent and can write device drivers.

    Black-helicopter style conspiracy theories.

    Nonsense; operating systems are supposed to manage resources.  Card
    interfaces are resources.

                   \/                 2.0.28 now.  Ugh.  I hate kernel hacking.
