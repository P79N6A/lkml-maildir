I believe it isn't. ;-) It works on various alphas including
configurations with chained PCI-PCI bridges.
Some comments on the patch:

No. As we reallocate everything, it is quite possible that we'll
have temporary overlaps during setup with resources allocated
by BIOS. I'm not sure if it is harmful though.

Agreed. Something like pcibios_set_bridge_control().

This change totally breaks PCI allocation logic.
Probably you assign PCI-PCI bridge windows in arch specific
code - why?
The only thing you need is to set up the root bus resources
properly and generic code will do the rest.

Same here.
