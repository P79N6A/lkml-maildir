Subject: [PATCH] fs/fcntl.c - remove impossible <0 check in do_fcntl - arg is unsigned.

The 'arg' argument to the function do_fcntl in fs/fcntl.c is of type
'unsigned long', thus it can never be less than zero (all callers of
do_fcntl take unsigned arguments as well and pass on unsigned values),
thus the check for 'arg < 0' in the F_SETSIG case of the switch in
do_fcntl can never be true and thus does not need to be there in the first
place.  Patch below (against 2.6.1-rc1-mm2) removes this dead code.

Patch is only compile tested, but as far as I can see it should be
correct.
Kind regards,
