The three modules perhaps should be a bundle of whatever ones you have
enabled, and internally we can dispatch the initialization to occur in
the correct order from a top-level module_init().
If the devices need to be initialized in a certain order in a
situation like this, it really seems like it is the kernel's job to
enforce it.
