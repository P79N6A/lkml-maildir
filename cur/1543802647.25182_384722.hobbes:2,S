Yes.
But ATM the signal handler calls waitpid() and stores the pid in a
to-be-cleaned-pids array (at time X).
The main loop at some time in the future (say at time X+N) walks through
the to-be-cleaned-pids array and cleans them from the active-childs
array.
If a new process is started between X and X+N with a pid in the
to-be-cleaned-pids it may happen (depends on the implementation - if the
active-childs array is "sorted" as childs are created (i.e. just append
the new pid at the end), holes of terminated childs are closed with
moving the rest of array and *never* reordered, than it may even work
then) that the wrong one (or both) are cleaned up.
But IMHO a too fragile solution in the log run as this doesn't scale and
people are inclined to tune it with sorting, hashing, etc.
