Hmmm... How does one benchmark buffer head performance? Guess just by 
copying files? Not sure if the following will cut it.
Two tests. First copying 8M of small files into a 16M ramdisk:
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; do
        mke2fs /dev/ram0 >/dev/null
        mount /dev/ram0 /media >/dev/null
        time cp -a /etc /media
        umount /dev/ram0
done;

The no constructor numbers are generally lower.
Lowest is no constructor with 0.089.
Second. Copy vmlinux (52M) to 128M ramdisk:
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; do
        mke2fs /dev/ram0 >/dev/null
        mount /dev/ram0 /media >/dev/null
        time cp slub/vmlinux /media
        umount /dev/ram0
done;

Same here. Low is 0.174 no constructor.
