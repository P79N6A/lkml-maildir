Hello !
I am using a VIA Board with KT400 chipset, AGP x8 (v3)
and the commercial ATI drivers for my Radeon 9600.
The standard 2.4.22 Kernel had the problem that AGP v3 was
not supported and AGPGart was not able to detect the AGP mem size.
My question is now is there a patch for the latest stable kernel
or do i have to use the dev. kernel ?
THANKS.
