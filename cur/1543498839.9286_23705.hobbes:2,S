hello
I've noticed strange behaviour of 2.2.9 i386 kernel. Here is explanation:
If sys_exit call in a user program is missing - this program hangs and
cannot be killed.
At all (kill -9 and SysRq will not help). Even if you kill that terminal -
program itself
remains anyway. Only way to kill - reboot.
This can lead to weird things..all can be done as nonpriveleged user.
On 2.0.36 kernel such program just dumps core, on 2.2.9 it becames
immortal..
also zero lenght core file is created..
May be this affects older 2.2. series too..
Sample code is enclosed - ELF binary and asm source.
Konstantin.
