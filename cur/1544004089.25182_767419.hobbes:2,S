Does this make the below patch obsolete?

A little thing: there are (or used to be) people who troll commits for
bugzilla reports to close off.  I've adopted the convention of
indicating bugzilla reports via their full URL to make those efforts
easier and to increase their accuracy.

When the driver is bound to a device and nobody opens the device node, it
will oops on suspend and resume, since it's not mapped and dev_priv->mmio
is NULL.
