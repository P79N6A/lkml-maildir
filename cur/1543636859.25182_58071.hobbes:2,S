Ok, 2.5.27 doesn't seem to touch any of the affected files; the patch
still applies.  In such a short time period, I've not been able to
confirm that it actually works with 2.5.27, only with 2.5.26.
Here's the complete patch; it's rather large, so for mortals it's
available from:
  
http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/cvs/serial-2.5.26-3.diff.bz2
I'm going to send it in mail to Linus separately.
