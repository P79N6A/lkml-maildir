i often wish for such things myself :)
unfortunately, the boot loader we utilize (u-boot) isnt exactly
friendly to the idea of managing flash partitions like redboot, and
what we have here is the current standard method for defining flash
partitions with mtd

we do, fortunately, have this luxury ... so we can look forward to a
nice cleaning of our syscall interface

these are arch specific, not machine (aka board)
this is what the blackfin family looks like (first entry is the architecture):
 - BF535
 - BF533 / BF532 / BF531
 - BF537 / BF536 / BF534
 - BF561
which is why you find the anomaly definitions in the architecture
specific header dir

in our last submission we were doing exactly that ... and we were told
to switch to a function style method of reading/writing memory mapped
registers

will do
thanks for reading through that monster :)
