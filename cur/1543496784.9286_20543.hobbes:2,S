Linux supports O_SYNC, fsync() and (in ext2) a per-directory sync update
attribute (man chattr).

No.  Application transactions may cover megabytes or more of update.
Filesystem transactions for journaling are limited in scope.  There is
no way that ext2/3 journaling will support application transactions.
Think about it --- the application may have data on multiple devices.
It really is up to the application to deal with it.
