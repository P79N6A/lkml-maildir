I also gave up on 2.3.31!
It killed my system very quickly :((
I've indeed a RICOH one.
But I always had trouble with PCMICA and 2.3.
(For example insert/remove/insert of my network card kills the machine).
I sended various mails, but no responce...
I'm using 2.2.13 as that one is stable for my job and with zach's driver
everything works, I stay there... I need to develop other stuff also and
that has prio one.
Although I need to hack on 2.3 to have process IO/network metrics introduced
before it become 2.4 (pain, pain, ....) and 2.3.30/31 didn't pick up my patches
(dunno why).
Sincerly,
Serge
