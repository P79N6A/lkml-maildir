ok. I tested my Chaintech 9EJL i845E mainboard the same way and I have 
exactly the same output with memtest86
BIOS - Std : 640k
BIOS - All : 4091M (memtest stops working afterwards)
Probe: 512M (since I have no shared graphics ram)
so the problem seems to be BIOS related. But what I don't understand is 
that since I tell the kernel to use 512 MByte of RAM (mem=512M) and 
kernels up to 2.4.19pre6 can handle this:
What changed and is there a workaround for kernels newer than 2.4.19pre6 
(for example telling the kernel not to rely on the memory information of 
the BIOS e820 procedure) ?
I tried to compile 2.4.20pre5-(ac) with the arch/i386/kernel/setup.c 
from 2.4.19pre6 but that didn't work.
Best regards
