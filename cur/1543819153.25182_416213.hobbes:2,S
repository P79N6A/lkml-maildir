Changing inet_init to fs_initcall() moves it way up the chain...
There are quite a few __initcall()s (way is this mapped to
device_initcall()?) and module_init()s in places where I would
never have expected them (e.g. kernel/).
After all the dependencies are anything but obvious to me. The
only obvious solution which fixes my problem would be to convert
qeth's module_init() to late_initcall().
