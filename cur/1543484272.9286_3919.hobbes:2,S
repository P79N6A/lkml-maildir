Subject: Ouch, who's been writing "if [ ! "$CONFIG_FOO" = "n" ]" ?

I'm fighting with xconfig again and I noticed some lines like this
have been showing up in the kernel source:
    # drivers/net/Config.in
    if [ ! "$CONFIG_PPP" = "n" ]; then
Please don't do this.  In bash, the operator precedence is undocumented,
and I hate to rely on undocumented behaviour.  In TCL, the operator
precedence is documented: ! is higher precedence than =, just like in C.
I'd really like to deploy my new bison-based parser, but until then,
I have to do conservative things like throw "!" out of Config Language.
