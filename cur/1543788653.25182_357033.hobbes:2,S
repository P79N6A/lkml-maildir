tried with -16 and -32, with/without accel=1, mtrr=1, extvga=1,
no problems. I _do_ see problems with >8 bpp when
warm-rebooting from windows. Cursor is a 8 character long
random pixelpile or a 3x3 ch blinking block of text.
 Cold boot and warm-rebooting from linux
are okay though (I suspect bios does not reset accel engine).
