Ok.

My goal was to keep all non-dvb i2c clients away from my dvb i2c adapters.
Because the "probe every device on every bus" policy is currently used,
I didn't want to touch every i2c driver and break things.

Yes, agreed.

8-) If this is the way to go, I totally agree, even if that means that
some drivers will fail to work in the beginning.

Sure.

Yes, sorry. If other drivers are in the I2C_ADAP_CLASS_TV_ANALOG class, 
they will be probed, too.
Hm, perhaps we should add another method where an adapter can specify 
the I2C_DRIVERID_*s from the clients it's expecting. The rationale 
behind this is, that most PCI cards can be identified uniquely by their 
vendor/subvendor ids, so the driver author definately knows which i2c 
clients are on the card and what are expected to be present. No need to 
probe every i2c client.
What do you think?

If we agree that this change should be done, this sound reasonable to me.
CU
Michael.
