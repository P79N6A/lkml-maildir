Subject: root-owned /proc/pid files for threaded apps?

I just upgraded from 2.4.8-pre3-ac2 to 2.4.19-pre2-ac2, and found that
for threaded programs like mozilla and xmms, files in /proc/<pid> are
owned by root, even if the process belongs to another user.  I
particularly wanted to be able to read /proc/<pid>/environ, but I can't.
Is this a known problem?  I haven't seen it float by.
I'll backtrack kernels to see if I can find the patch that caused it and
report back if I hear nothing.
Thanks,
Danek
