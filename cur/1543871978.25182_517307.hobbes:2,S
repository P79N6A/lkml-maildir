Thanks; that's an interesting explanation.
It misses the point of what I was saying to Sergei, though, which was
*not* "I don't understand your patch", it was "if this patch goes into
a git tree, someone coming along in 3 years time won't understand the
patch."  In other words I was ranting about the need for a decent
description to accompany the patch itself, so it would go into the
permanent record.
Regards,
Paul.
