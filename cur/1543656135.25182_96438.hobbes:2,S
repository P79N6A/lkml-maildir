As soon as I start oggenc on my 2.5 kernel, I get this message:
  CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000004
  Bank 0: f60600000000135 at 000000001ea46db0
  Kernel panic: CPU context corrupt
This vc then hangs, but I could log in and write down the message on
another vc.  Is this a hardware error?  Should I replace my CPU?  My
memory?  Is my machine overheating?  I have had several strange and
unexplained segfaults and reboots under 2.4 recently.
