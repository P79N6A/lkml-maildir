Can do. Note that "my setup" in that case consisted of browsing around 
eBay in firefox with ogg123 playing audio directly to ALSA in an xterm 
as the only other thing running. That is, just about as basic a Linux 
desktop as imagineable.
Testing Mike's latest will have to wait a bit though; I'm currently 
testing the latest incarnation of SD (against 2.6.20.6). For people 
who've lost track of what and where, it's available as:
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/staircase-deadline/2.6.20.5-sd-0.39.patch
and versus 2.6.21-rc5 as:
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/staircase-deadline/2.6.21-rc5-sd-0.39.patch
For the moment it is giving me a snappy feeling desktop on this Duron 
1300, with ogg123 playing in an xterm without audio underruns, with a 
make -j2 kernel compile running (not niced) and me browsing around in 
firefox.
Mike latest would probably also support this load without much problem. 
Given that I feel the basic idea of SD is better than mainline though, 
I'll be concentrating on using SD for a bit for now.
Rene.
