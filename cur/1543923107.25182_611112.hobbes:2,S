If you go down that route, you end up with _lots_ of circular
dependencies - header file X needs Y needs Z which needs X.  We've
been there, several times.  It very quickly becomes quite
unmaintainable - you end up with hard to predict behaviour from
include files.
The only realistic solution is to use forward declarations.
