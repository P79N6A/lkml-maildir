I don't care how a distribution is called (GNU/Linux seems to me a name
good as another). The real problem is that you are discussing about
distribution's name on linux-kernel mailing list. Here the principal
subject is the kernel. You can not say that Linux kernel itself is to be
coupled with GNU. So while I can agree that a distribution can be quite
reasonably called GNU/Linux I can not agree that the kernel itself be
called GNU/Linux. On this mailing list we talk about kernels so in this
place, Richard please, call it simply Linux and not GNU/Linux. You are
talking with people that have devoted lot of time in developing the kernel
and you show quite a bit of lack of respect for that people insisting to
call linux GNU/Linux.

I have _never_ seen a single person using the term GNU/Linux on this
mailing list, except you.
And, as a last thing, I'm sure that all the people on this list have much
respect for GNU and your efforts, past, present and future. Please show a
bit more respect for Linus and all the other people and their efforts
to make the linux kernel the best underlying structure (and note here that
I have not called it an OS knowing your definition of OS) GNU software
have ever running on: call the linux kernel "Linux" as Linus wanted to
call it and all the people, at least here, love to call it and not
"GNU/Linux".
Ciao,
	Riccardo.
