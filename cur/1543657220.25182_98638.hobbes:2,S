This is the standard way to get process context [i.e. somewhere where
you can sleep].  The new delayed-work workqueue code in 2.5.x does
something almost exactly like that under the covers.
That said, it sounds like you found something to fix in ACPI:
In 2.4.x ACPI, it should be using schedule_task(), and in 2.5.x it should
be using schedule_work(), if this is truly the intention of the ACPI
subsystem.
There shouldn't be much reason to continually spawn single-run threads
when there is already an API for doing so.
