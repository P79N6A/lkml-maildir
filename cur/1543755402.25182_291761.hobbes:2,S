    I have 2.4.29 running and uptime is about 24 hours now, and with
1Gig of RAM and a loadavg in the last 15 minutes has been 4, more or
less, and I have 130 megs of free memory and none of my 512 megs swap
is used. And this is very common for me. The only way of using swap
is starting X, mozilla (some pre-firefox version will do) and one of
the many memory leaking apps available for the X Window System. On
console, with the apps I run usually (that includes setiathome too,
and heavy use of the C compiler) I don't hit swap. This is my memory
status right now:
         total:     used:     free:  shared: buffers:   cached:
Mem:  927006720 796491776 130514944        0  5517312 738082816

    Pretty low usage, and still more than 700MB of cached memory
available to avoid using swap.
