It subsumes it, similar to Dominik's ideas in "[RFC] Dynamic Frequency
and Voltage Scaling Infrastructure" (on the cpufreq list). The idea is
that you want scaling events to be generated by the kernel rather than
only scaling on userland input. The paper (and Dominik's mail) give you
some ideas of when and why...
