There is no race for arm, but using the preempt_schedule() interface is
the approach which Ingo suggested for common usage, but his x86
implementation was racy, so I fixed this first before modifying arm to
use the interface. Ingo pointed out that he will change it to
preempt_schedule_irq, but I'm not religious about the name.
