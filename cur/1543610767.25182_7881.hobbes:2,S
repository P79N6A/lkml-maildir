Hi Neil,
  The following patch fixes a bug in the knfsd readahead code. The
memset() that is referenced in the patch below is clobbering the
pointer to the next list element (ra->p_next), thus reducing the inode
readahead cache to 1 entry upon the very first call to
nfsd_get_raparms().
  BTW: looking at the choice of cache size. Why is this set to number
of threads * 2? Isn't it better to have a minimum cache size? After
all, the fact that I have 8 threads running does not at all reflect
the number of inodes that I might have open on my various clients...
Cheers,
   Trond
