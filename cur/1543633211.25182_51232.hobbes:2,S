I agree. M$ did .lnk _files_, but really, there's not symlinks in vfat
world. Even msdos doesn't recognize them. I don't remember if it's the
same in NTFS, W2000 & XP are so good that I can't work with them in 32MB
RAM...
And I must say that symlinks are not needed in most of the windows 9X
systems. They aren't really useful for most of the systems. But if
someone needs it, it'd be include as a .config option.....
