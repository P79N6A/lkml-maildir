Saw the "reset config" option on the PnP/PCI BIOS setup screen and tried
it.  No difference, but a good observation.

Silver stars to the folks that suggested checking the "plug-n-play OS"
BIOS setting: it *was* set to "yes", but setting it to "no" didn't fix
the problem.  It *did* change the behavior of Linux slightly in that
the aic7xxx driver saw something at (0,0,0,0) and was trying to talk to
it at 10 MB/s.  That's the only thing the driver saw, however...  I still
got the infinite timeout/reset loop.
Next thing to try is a different/better motherboard.  Once I pluck the
old one, if Martin et. al. would like to try and figure out what's up
with it as far as PCI oddities and/or interrupt handling, I'd be happy to
make it available.  Thanks for the help, folks...  I *do* appreciate it.
