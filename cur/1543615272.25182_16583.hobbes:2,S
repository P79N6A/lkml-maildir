That sounds like it might be what I'm after.  My goal is to be able to probe 
the machine and set ISA_CARDS based on the probe.  What's a DMI table and
how can I query it for the presence of ISA slots?
What I want to do with this is make ISA-card questions invisible on modern
PCI-only motherboards.

are times when the free person's answer to oppressive government has to be
delivered with a bullet.  Thus, the right to bear arms is not just *a*
freedom; it's the mother of all freedoms.  Don't let them disarm you!
