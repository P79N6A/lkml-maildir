OK for discussion purposes no problem .. what ever is the best at the end
is the GO.
Abstractly speaking, mangling the <container,upid> tuple into the same
long int is an implementation detail.

If you follow the patch set, we do distinguish the context case (we might have
missed a few here and there, as you already pointed out), but going into
the kernel we always take the context of the caller, coming out of the
kernel kpid -> upid we do use the appropriate context.
