I've never seen or heard of any x86-32 or x86-64 system that supports hot-swap RAM. Our 
hardware does not support PPC, and our software doesn't support ia-64.

Well, our primary concern is getting our stuff to work.  Since get_user_pages() doesn't 
work, but mlock() does, that's what we use.  I don't know how to fix get_user_pages(), and 
I don't have the time right now to figure it out.  I know that technically mlock() is not 
the right way to do it, and so we're not going to be submitting our code for the mainline 
until get_user_pages() works and our code uses it instead of mlock().
