This is just not good engineering.
It is axiomatic that it is easy to add code, but difficult to remove 
code.  It takes -years- to remove code that no one uses.  Long after the 
maintainer disappears, the users (and bug reports!) remain.
It is also axiomatic that adding code, particularly core code, often 
exponentially increases complexity.
