Hope it will go away?  There's some relatively deep reason to do with
migration which makes preempt very difficult to support, but I've
forgotten the details.  I've been wondering if there's some way to make
it runtime selectable without massive performance cost.

Yes, this has been my preferred approach.  So for each of the restrictions:
PREEMPT - hard, will try to do something at runtime
HZ - I'm assuming dynticks will appear in the short term, and this will
become moot
KEXEC - there's been some work on making KEXEC and Xen play nicely
together; I was waiting to see if that matures, and/or make it runtime
switchable in the meantime
DOUBLEFAULT - not really an issue; guests won't get them under Xen (I
think) and we can ignore setting the gate pretty easily
