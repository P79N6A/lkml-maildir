Yep, having multiple connections is worse for high-performance networks
and is a great win for long latency links. If client to server
connection is slower than server-server one, than having single gate
server, which broadcasts data to others is a win over multiple
connection to different servers. But if communication is roughly the
same over all links, than... I think I agree that client-to-many is a
better approach, since perormance of client-to-many will be the same as
client-to-gate-to-others (since link is the same everywhere), but if
gate server fails, reconnection and other management tasks introduce
huge latency here (new gate server, new connection and so on), while
with client-to-many we just proceed with other connections.

But that's a different leader :)

Probably idea I described in other mail to Jeff, when client just
connects to number of servers and can process command of adding/dropping
server from that group, and balances reading between them and sends
writes/metadata update to all of them, and all logic behind that group
selection is hidded in the servers cloud, is the best choice...
