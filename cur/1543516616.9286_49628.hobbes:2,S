But then we call wake_up(), we wake-up the second thread.
Now the second thread either acquires the lock, or it sets the value
back to 1.
This should be OK.

I thought that would simplify the code. But unfortunately,
write_lock_trylock() is not atomic, and this means my proposal is
impossible.
I'm searching for another solution.
