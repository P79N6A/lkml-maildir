Dear Maurice Volaski,
Please update Areca Firmware version into 1.42.
Areca's firmware team found some problems on high capacity transfer.
Hope the weird  phenomenon should disappear.
Areca had some experiences from its subsystem producers about vibration.
The vibration issue can lower your transfer rate.
The vibration factor always comes from system's power supply and cooling 
fans.
In Areca Lab. will research if there were any compatibility issue with these 
type disks of you used.
Best Regards
Erich Chen
