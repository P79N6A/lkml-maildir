Subject: Negative scalability by removal of lock_kernel()? (Was: Strange performance behavior of 2.4.0-test9)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Finally, I found:
Removal of lock_kernel in fs/fcntl.c causes the strange performance of
2.4.0-test9.
The removal causes following negative scalability on Apache-1.3.9:
	* 8-way performance dropped to 60% of 4-way performance.
	* Adding lock_kernel() gains 2.4x performance on 8-way.
This suggests some design malfunction exist in the fs-code.
The lock_kernel() is removed in test9, as shown in below, then the
strange behavior appeared.
linux-2.4.0-test8/fs/fcntl.c:
asmlinkage long sys_fcntl(unsigned int fd, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)
{	
	struct file * filp;
	long err = -EBADF;
	filp = fget(fd);
	if (!filp)
		goto out;
-->	lock_kernel();
	err = do_fcntl(fd, cmd, arg, filp);
-->	unlock_kernel();
 	fput(filp);
out:
	return err;
}
Adding the lock_kernel()/unlock_kernel() to test9:fs/fcntl.c,
	The performance is restored,
	The number of task switch is reduced, and
	Positive scalability is observed.
The lock region may be narrowed to around call of posix_lock_file()
in fcntl_setlk() (fs/locks.c).
I usually prefer removal of kernel_lock, but at this time,
the removal severy struck the performance.
Please give me suggestions..
