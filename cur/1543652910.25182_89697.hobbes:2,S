The LVM1 tools require the lvm module.  The LVM2 tools require the
device-mapper module (and therfore, for 2.4, a patch).  LVM2 is
backward-compatible with LVM1 in the sense that LVM2 can use
LVM1-created volume groups.
I've been running LVM2 (I used to use LVM1) on my laptop for the past
few weeks (2.4.19, also patched with rmap14b), and it's been
completely trouble-free.
