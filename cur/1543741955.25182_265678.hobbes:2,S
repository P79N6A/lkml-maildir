note that DEBUG_PREEMPT got more expensive in the -V kernels. I'd
suggest to disable all the 'y' ones in both the -U and -V kernel and
compare them then.
but especially the userspace overhead seems to be significantly higher
in the -V kernel so i'm not quite sure it can all be attributed to
debugging overhead. We'll see.
also, how does the context-switching rate compare between the two tests? 
This test is pretty steady when it's running, so the context-switch
rates can be directly compared, correct?
