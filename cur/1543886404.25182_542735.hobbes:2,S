* According to the report, things still work till 27c78b37 - commit for
the actual merge and there's no related change till the current master
from there.  So, which commit actually breaks detection?  Or is
detection just flaky after b8cffc6a?
* How does things work on 9b89391c?
Also, please turn on printk timestamp on all reports so that we can now
the timeline of things.
Thanks.
