My thinkpad happily locks up with both 2.4.9 and 2.4.10-pre14 when I
load usb-ohci. Tracing with kdb shows that the system locks up right
after executing this: (usb-ohci.c:2137)
        /* HC Reset requires max 10 ms delay */
        writel (OHCI_HCR,  &ohci->regs->cmdstatus);
Anyone have any idea? The processor apparently never gets to the next
instruction.

P.S. System chipset is ALi:
00:14.0 USB Controller: Acer Laboratories Inc. [ALi] M5237 USB (rev 03) (prog-if 10 [OHCI])
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 10
        Memory at 82400000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
Shares IRQ with cardbus bridge and lcd controller.
