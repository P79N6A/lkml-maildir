I committed a patch which fixes this issue:
http://mcentral.de/hg/~mrec/v4l-dvb-stable/
That problem got caused by releasing data structures which are still
in use when the device gets unplugged. These patches delay the
deallocation of the data till the last user releases its reference to
the dvb nodes.
This patch got tested with devices which use the dvb-usb framework as
well as em28xx based dvb devices.
