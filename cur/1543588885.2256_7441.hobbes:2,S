May I remind everybody that at the beginning of this thread I posted
another example, from an SMP Alpha, of FPU problems.  It certainly
was not exactly like the one under discussion but it looked that
it had a similar "smell" to it.
It looks like that to reproduce this Alpha example one needs processors
with a rather fast clock and this hardware version is not yet very
widely available.
