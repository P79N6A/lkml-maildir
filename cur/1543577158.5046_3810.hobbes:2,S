That's a bit surprising that you have so many problems with unfsd, I know
lots of installations where it is (still) used successfully in its limits.
I did recently some mainteance work on it to fix it for reiserfs.

(when you ignore locking and NFS over TCP ATM) All you need is to forward
UDP packets. This can either be done by a normal user space daemon that
uses portmap and just sends the packets out again, or alternatively by using
UDP masquerading and appropiate routes on the internal boxes.
Only forwarding packets is very different from full reexport support in knfsd
and much simpler.
