Clever idea.
I don't know... atomic_inc_not_zero is implemented very easily on the
many architectures without SMP, and I think it *could* be implemented
very nicely on ll/sc based architectures without using cmpxchg.
Lastly, your InterlockedIncrement and InterlockedDecrement are not
actually atomic_inc (LOCK INC), but atomic_inc_return (XADD). Another
primitive like atomic_inc_return_negative or something could be added
to take advantages of status flags and use LOCK INC, but this will
probably not be worthwhile for any architecture other than i386/x86-64
(ie. it will be plain worse on most ll/sc and UP-only architectures
once they get around to implementing atomic_inc_not_zero properly)
Also, the extra logic and atomic op in the decrement-to-zero case
takes a bit of shine off it even for i386. I'd say we should stick
to what we have unless we see some really compelling numbers.
