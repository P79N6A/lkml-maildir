If you send both to area famous for seedy dealers?  Yeah - both will
come back with painted pieces of shit, unless they'll have uncommon
luck to find something better.  And that's a *BIG* luck.
	Face it - in a lot of categories the market of software is market
of snake oil.  When all alternatives on the market are utter crap and that
situation hadn't been changed in decades...  And I mean all - be they
commercial, free, for Linux, Solaris, Windows, VMS, HP-UX, yaddda, yadda;
it doesn't matter.
	It's nice to pretend that this is not the case.  Just don't forget
to pray when you view a PDF or PostScript document from some site.  Or
listen to mp3.  Or view a picture in one of $BIGNUM formats.
	And don't give me that crap about Sturgeon's Law - for many categories
we are talking about 100%, not 90%.  Sheesh...
