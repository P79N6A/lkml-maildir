Slight error in my initial diagnosis of why procps is getting Hertz
wrong tho.  It's not because timer interrupts are only happening
on one CPU.  It's because it thinks I have 4 CPUs per system, when
really I only have 2 CPUs per system.
It's taking jiffies from the sum of the figures on the first line
of /proc/stat and dividing by the uptime in seconds from /proc/uptime
multiplied by the number of CPUs.  The system has two CPUs, #0 and #1,
and is reporting _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF as 4 (the count used by procps
as the number of CPUs).
Looks like even if it is procps's fault for not just using HZ==100,
the kernel is leading it astray by claiming I have twice as many
CPUs as I really do.
uyer@praxis8:~$ make cpus
cc     cpus.c   -o cpus
luyer@praxis8:~$ cat cpus.c
#include <unistd.h>
main () {
  printf("%d\n", sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF));
}
luyer@praxis8:~$ ./cpus
4
luyer@praxis8:~$ grep 'processor        ' /proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0
processor       : 1
luyer@praxis8:~$ dmesg | grep -E 'Initializing CPU|CPU #. not
responding'
Initializing CPU#0
Initializing CPU#1
CPU #3 not responding - cannot use it.
