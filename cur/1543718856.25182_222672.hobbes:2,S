But parallel PCI is transaction based, which largely gives the same
effect as being packet based.  And you can have man data cycles for
every address cycle.  What I am not yet clear are the transaction splitting
rules.  My outstanding questions that I really need to track down are:
- Must a 64bit memory write transaction have the same effect as 2
  32bit write transactions?   
- Must a 64bit read transaction have the same effect as 2 32bit
  read transactions?
If true then it is impossible to implement the corresponding 64bit
atomic transaction on the PCI bus, and locks are required for
everyone's code.
The same questions can be asked of PCI-Express.
As soon as I managed to dig a copy of the protocol specifications
I will see if I can answer those questions.
