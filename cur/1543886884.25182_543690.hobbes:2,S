This, btw, means that do_exit()->__free_pipe_info() is not cpu-hotplug friendly.
The task may sleep on mutex_lock(->i_mutex), and dequeued from rq->arrays[].
The parent reaps this task, or it was TASK_DEAD and reaped itself.
CPU_DEAD comes, migration_call(CPU_DEAD) can do nothing with this task:
	- we already did release_task()->__unhash_process(), so
	  migrate_live_tasks() can't see it
	- migrate_dead_tasks() can't see it because it was deactivated.
No?
probably __might_sleep() should also check __exit_state.
Oleg.
