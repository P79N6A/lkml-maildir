Hallo,
there is some misterious with apm and cdrom locks.
mount /mnt/cdrom
(the cdrom is locked and mounted, I can't get it open, OK)
apm -s
(the notebook goes to sleep, and me too :))
after awaking the notebook,
the cdrom is still mounted (ok),
but I can get it open, by pressing the eject button.
In my opinion, it is not ok.
Notebook: Dell Inspiron 8000
Kernel: 2.4.17
apm version: 3.0.2
