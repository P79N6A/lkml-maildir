The kernel locks up regardless of what drivers I use (and I have tried 
the vga16 drivers already).
Disabling the accelerated functions also "fixes" the machine, for some 
definitions of "fix" :).
My question is really why this problem would lock up the kernel...
I can't really tell whether the problem is in the implementation of the 
XFree86 functions or the kernel functions it is calling, but the fact 
that the entire kernel locks up suggests that both are to blame.  Can 
you suggest where I should start reading code (if not the file atleast 
the directory :).
