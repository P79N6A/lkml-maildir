I missed this subthread originally.
I think it is important that we can have containers in containers
if at all possible.  This means large software collections can count
on them being present.
As for having some items inside a namespace show up in both
a parent and a child namespace I think the case is less clearly
defined.  If possible that is something we want to avoid as it
complicates the implementation.
For pids I will be surprised if we can avoid it.
For most other namespaces I think we can, and it is a good thing
to avoid.
