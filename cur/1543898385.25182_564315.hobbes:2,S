Git complains for a very simple reason: that file is an empty file, and 
"make clean" removes all zero-sized files.
So whenever anybody does a "make clean" (maybe it's "make distclean", I 
forget), you will have removed the empty file, and git will show it as a 
diff.
We probably should just remove the file from the kernel archive.
