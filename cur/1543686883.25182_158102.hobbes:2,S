Really, I don't know if you don't uderstand or you don't want to
understand...
There is _NOT_ any problem of duplicated IPs or so.
It's a Load Balancing scenary, similar to linuxvirtualserver and ARP
problem that rise _ONLY_ when using Linux as real server:
http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/docs/arp.html
If you send a packet through dev eth0 to dev lo IP address or other
interface, when Linux try to map the MAC address with the IP address of
the default gateway (or the gateway to reach the packet Source IP
address), it uses the lo IP address (or other dev) in the ARP Request.
