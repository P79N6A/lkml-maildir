I assume you are talking about this patch:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-mm-commits&m=115773820415171
I think it's ok, info->notify_owner is always used under info->lock.
This is simple. If, for example, mqueue_read_file() didn't take info->lock,
then we have a problem: pid_nr() may read a freed memory in case when
__do_notify()->put_pid() happens at the same time.
In this context info->notify_owner is a usual refcounted object, no special
attention is needed.
Oleg.
