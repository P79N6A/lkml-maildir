Oops.  Good catch.  Thanks, Andrew.
Probably solvable (lockable) but this line of thought is
getting to be more trouble than I suspect it's worth.
I'm still a little surprised that this per-mm 'oom_notify' bit
was needed to implement what I thought was a single, global
system wide oom killer serializer.
But I'm too ignorant and lazy, and too distracted by other
tasks, to actually think that surprise through.
Good luck with it, Dave.
