Store it in the task struct, and store a pointer to the previous (outer
lock) in that lock, then you've got a linked list of locks per task - very
useful. You'll need a helper function - current() is hard to get at from
spinlock.h due to tangled dependencies. As I mentioned before, it can also
be very handy to stash the address of the code that took the lock in the
lock itself.

NEVER_SLEEPS will only trigger on the rare events that blow up anyway,
while the MAY_SLEEP version catches _potential_ problems even when the
fatal sleep doesn't happen.
