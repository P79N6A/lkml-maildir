Hi,
The behavior is not very clear here, the root problem is that :
1. Should we call kobject_put so cleanup work can be done by refcount
touch zero or call kfree every time after kobject_register failed?
2. If kobject_put calling is true, should this be done in
kobject_register error handling codes or by hand after
kobject_register failed?
