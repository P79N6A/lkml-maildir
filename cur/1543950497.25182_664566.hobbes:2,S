If the kernel allows state to leak from one process to another,
for example from a process running as root to a process running as an
ordinary user, it's a bug, with possible security implications.
In this particular case not much can be communicated through a one-bit
flag, so it would only be relevant in those situations where you want
to forbid any communication channels from a given process.  So the
kernel developers might consider it a trivial bug.  Or, they could just
fix it, which I understand is the plan.
