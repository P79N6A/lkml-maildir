But 2.4 wasn't quite that deprecated when version 0.0.6
of iswraid was announced on Nov 24, 2003. I don't know
the exact 2.6 timeline but ChangeLog-2.6.0 at www.kernel.org
seems to be dated Dec 17, 2003. Yes, perhaps we should
have asked for consideration sooner...

Like you said, superior from a maintenance point of view.
The users might choose a different measure for superiority.
The coder doing the work may choose yet another way of
deciding which way to proceed. For example, if time was all
that mattered, I think, it would be faster for me to just make
an iswraid port to 2.6 than to try to work with dm+dmraid
which I know very little about, in order to get the same
features supported. But, because I can't speak for my employer,
let me agree with you here and say that yes, I stand corrected,
it is quite possible that it has not been ported because a user
space solution is superior.

You've made your reasons so clear that I don't really mind.
   These opinions are solely mine and
   may not agree with those of my employer.
