I've no spelling knowledge, so the list of spellcorrections must be made
by someone else. But i can volunteer the perl-snippet to correct the
files. :-)
See attachment.
The programm uses this file-format:
correct=false1,false2,false3...
As there are many ways to false-write a word i think this is the best(tm)
solution to get readable file.
:-)
I've only done a "quick-debug", so there might still be errors in the
program. (Including spelling-bugs ;-) )

Usage: spell_fix.pl <options>, where valid options are
    --help            # this message :-)
    --file <file>     # File(s) to be checked
    --dir <dir>       # Directory(s) to be checked (recursive!)
    --spell-file      # File with the correction-list
    --debug           # Debugging-Messages

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer
wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated,
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
