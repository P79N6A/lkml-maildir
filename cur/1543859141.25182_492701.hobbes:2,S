OK, got the 2.6.19 kernel installed and running OK, full libata wrapping of
existing IDE controllers and hard disks.
I'm experiencing some odd, random periodic system lockups without any sort
of debugging information being captured in the system message log.  Perhaps
it's a hard disk that's causing the trouble?
Is there a way to capture which drive might be causing the issue in the
message log?
