That's one kinky driver, no wonder you were traumatized by looking
at it. I think you must not project the shock and horror of usb-ohci
onto other drivers. Gerard already defended the Symbios SCSI.
There may be some approaches to deal with the problem. One is
to leave hash in and clean up the rest. It would probably
break a number of devices and take a time to straighten out.
Another possibility is to limit the number of URBs that are
posted in any given time to the hardware.

No, it's not bounded. Outside implementation has to be much more
complex to accomodate slightly different requirements of different
drivers.
And remember, you can put it in, but cannot pull it out.
