This may be a good idea, but I'm too lazy to think in trinary. Care to
send a patch?

What does it hurt? I think the split was rather clean, along well defined
functional lines, with minimum dependencies. They may even be separate
modules later.

I'm sorry about that. I will add a file in Documentation/ .

You are right, the current text format (0t) is not easily readable.
My plan calls for the parsing of control messages and things like SCSI
commands to be placed in user mode applications, like USBMon. This is how
tcpdump and Ethereal operate. I don't like to keep too much of this in
kernel. Do you think it's a wrong approach?

When I read dumps, I mentally fetch the device number from the pipe.
Just use that for now, please.
But if you or someone else were to hack on something like usbdump(1),
it would be peachy, I think.
