Alan,
I just installed 2.2.5ac3 on my K6-2/166.  The Matrox FB driver says:
matroxfb: MTRR's turned on
However, I don't have a /proc/mtrr file...  I don't know enough
about the K6-2 to know if I should or not.
/proc/cpuinfo:
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : AuthenticAMD
cpu family      : 5
model           : 6
model name      : AMD-K6tm w/ multimedia extensions

cpu MHz         : 166.404677
fdiv_bug        : no
hlt_bug         : no

I must say, I've never seen this box behave so snappily.  :)
Thanks in advance,
Jim Gifford
