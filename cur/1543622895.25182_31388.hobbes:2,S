With 2.5.6-pre2 you will always get just enough code to be able to
load nfsd as a module later, even if you didn't compile nfsd as a
module this time.  Unless modules are disabled of course.
There have been a number of problem reports on linux-kernel over the
last year or two from people who cannot load nfsd.o as a module.
Often it is because they originally compiled without and NFSD support
at all, but subsequently decided that wanted to compile and load
nfsd.o
This works for many modules (e.g. filesystems)  It is reasonable that
it work for nfsd as well.
I thought that the cost of always including the hooks to load nfsd was
minimal, and worth the consistency/convenience.
Does that seem reasonable to you?
