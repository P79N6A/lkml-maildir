There are no changes required to the kernel entry / exit paths.  With 
save/restore segment support in the VMI, reserving one segment for the 
hypervisor data area is easy.
I take it back.  There is one required change:
kernel_entry:
     hypervisor_entry_hook
     sti
     .... kernel code
This hypervisor_entry_hook can be a nop on native hardware, and the 
following for Xen:
push %gs
mov CPU_HYPER_SEL, %gs
pop %gs:SAVED_USER_GS
You already have the IRET / SYSEXIT hooks to restore it on the way 
back.  And now you have a segment reserved that allows you to deal with 
16-bit stack segments during the IRET.

!CONFIG_SMP  -- as I believe I saw in the latest Xen patches sent out as
