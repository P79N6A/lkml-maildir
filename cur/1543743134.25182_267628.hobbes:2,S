Mine is a Tyan Tiger K8W. :)

Could be the compiler, I'm using a gcc HEAD snapshot from yesterday.
However since I do not have any problems with the panics replaced by
printk I have troubles to understand the meaning of them.

Fair enough. Thanks for the pointer.

Strange. The ACPI tables seem to be filled with valueable information
which I can enable pretty finegrained in the BIOS and I even seem to get
somewhat useful options with the first CPU.
Also /proc/cpuinfo mentions powermanagement:
...
TLB size        : 1088 4K pages
clflush size    : 64
cache_alignment : 64
address sizes   : 40 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
power management: ts ttp
Whatever ts and ttp may mean.
I'd really love to have this machine running and use its power on demand
instead of having to think about a more sophisticated airflow to keep
the temperature (of idle CPUs) and thus the noiselevel down.
Servus,
       Daniel
