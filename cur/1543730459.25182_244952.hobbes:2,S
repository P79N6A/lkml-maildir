Just posted version 2 of rng-tools at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/
This release fixes a problem related to 2.6.x kernels.
rng-tools is currently for users of hardware random number generators 
(RNGs), and the included daemon rngd fill the kernel entropy pool from 
userspace with the results of the output.
Future directions include:
* support for VIA 'xcrypt' instruction in userspace, avoiding the need 
for a kernel driver
* multithreaded daemon
* additional entropy sources besides the dedicated h/w RNG
