In the case where you are getting EAGAIN, this is a busy-spin.  You 
might want to sleep in a select() or similar call as soon as you get
EAGAIN on this socket..or go off and do other work while the OS clears
out the send queue.
Also, from your description, this code should return 0 on success.  It
is returning 'ret_val' instead, which should be > 0.
I have no idea why you need to add the MIN() logic..and that seems like 
something that should not be required.

Even 112kbps sucks on a decent network.  What is the speed of your 
network, what protocol are you using, if tcp, what is the latency
of your network?
