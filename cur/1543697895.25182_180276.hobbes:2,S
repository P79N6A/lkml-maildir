Same problem here. Been seeing them now and again for quite a while
I have syslogd and klogd sleeping in do_syslog. cron and login are
sleeping in schedule_timeout. A sysrq+T gets things going again but
unfortunately the interesting state probably wasn't captured. I have
the /proc/*/wchan and sysrq+t trace if anyone is interested.
I'll try any suggestions of what I should look at when I hit it again.
