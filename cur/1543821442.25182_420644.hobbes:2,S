Looks good, I dropped it on an ASUS laptop running FC4 and everything 
works, including the selinux stuff. However, I did note these things:
1 - sounds has stopped working on the FC4 kernel (again) 2.6.16.11 ok
2 - at boot, the 2.6.16.11 kernel stops after the "storage" text in the 
"initializing" line, and hangs long enough for me to say "Oh .... it 
hung" before continuing.
3 - ipw2200 wireless continues to work flawlessly. I mention this 
because there was a time when every patch was an adventure.
Thanks for the patches.
