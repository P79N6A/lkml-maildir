OK, I almost convinced it may be removed.
My point is, this initialization with 0 cost nothing. Readability and 
clearness of code do matter, on my opinion. I think when one states 
explicitly he expect variable to have 0 value, it is better then use 
implicit rules.
To illustrate zero cost, I did the following test:
[tmp]$ cat t.c; gcc -S t.c; cat t.s
static int a1=0;
static int a2;
/* EOF */
    .file    "t.c"
    .local    a1
    .comm    a1,4,4
    .local    a2
    .comm    a2,4,4
    .section    .note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
    .ident    "GCC: (GNU) 3.3.1 20030811 (Red Hat Linux 3.3.1-1)"
As you can see, assembly code is identical, compiler did this trivial 
optimization for me.
Vladimir.
