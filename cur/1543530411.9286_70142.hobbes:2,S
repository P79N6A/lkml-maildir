Probably a bit off topic, but I couldn't resist.  Apologies in advance,
but I thought some of the folks on the kernel list might be interested in
an anecdotal report on the quality of the stuff helped build.

That sounds like a awful lot of work.  I just set 'em up and let 'em run. 
As of now: 
Box1 
Linux box1 1.2.13 #30 Fri Aug 16 19:04:57 PDT 1996 i586
  8:00pm  up 316 days, 24 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.26, 0.09, 0.02
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root            3 Dec 24  1997 inetd.pid
Box2
Linux box2 2.0.29 #2 Wed Mar 19 21:02:31 PST 1997 i486
  8:02pm  up 316 days,  5:43,  0 users,  load average: 0.08, 0.02, 0.01
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root            3 Dec 24  1997 inetd.pid
As you can see from the associated times on the inetd.pid files, the
'reported' runtime is about 497 days off of the 'actual' runtime.  In
fact, the first box has been rebooted only twice since going into
service in March of 1994, both times because of power outages that
exhausted even the 30KVA UPS they share with some other systems.  For
the record we had an HP that was in the high 900's days uptime before it
had to be taken down to be moved.  I'm shooting for a new site record.
Times two. <G>
I know there are all sorts of security issues and so on with these older
systems, but I just don't have the heart to upgrade.  I changed the host
names in case somebody inside the firewall is reading this and wants to
try a POD or any of a bunch of other nastys.
That said, these are two POP servers that have just kept on ticking.
After the roll over of the clock I had to restart most services,
cron, named, klogd, xntp etc, and ps no longer generates useful start time
information for the processes, but the boxes keep servicing POP requests
and that is all the users care about. 
Thanks folks!  Good work. I can think of maybe two or three software
crashes across maybe a 20 or so machines in the last 7 years! I wish the
stuff we pay big bucks for worked as well.  sigh.
