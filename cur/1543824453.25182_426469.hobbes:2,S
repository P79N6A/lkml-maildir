list_splice is great for that. I can for sure see this benefit

I think that if you say A you should say B, I mean, if you make the list
per SB you probably just should do the step and make at least the
counter per SB as well. That will also save in cacheline bounces I
suppose...  but more importantly you keep the counters next to the list.
Which you'll also need to do any kind of scaling I suppose later on, so
might as well keep the stats already.

well what it would do is make sure an unmount causes a lot of free
pages, not just fragmented slabs.
Also it will give some more locality to group related dentries together,
so pinning wise it will help some.. but yeah at this point this is just
hand holding. I'm just sort of wondering how much stuff can be made per
SB.. if we go this way with the list, maybe just more can follow...
