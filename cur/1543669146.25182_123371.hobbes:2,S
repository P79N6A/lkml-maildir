Autoneg must be completed within 2 sec, or else it is considered as
failed.
It should be pointed out that there is a difference between completing
autonegotation and being able to pass traffic to other devices in the
network. The spanning tree and port fast settings have nothing to do with
autonegotiation. With port fast disabled on these switches, autonegotation
usually completes in the required 2s, but the switch does not pass frames to
the rest of the network until spanning tree assures loop free topology. The
NIC and switch port are actively passing traffic, but the switch is not
forwarding that traffic.
Hope this helps clarify.
