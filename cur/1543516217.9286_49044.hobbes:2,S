no, the system is quescent. This is getting more complex and therefore 
more exciting; due to my ignorance of 
the page cache - Alan Cox gave me a hint on how that request function works 
and I realize that I need to understand this beast called "page cache" :(
Basically, I am going to trace all requests to rd and see if ever get any 
READ requests. I don't yet understand how this mechanism "page cache" is 
going to satisfy all requests before they actually hit the block device 
layer. I suppose the fileops points to block_read/block_write so that is 
how things happen. So, I need to trace all io via block_read/write for 
the specific rdev corresponding to my device.
Still looking (but soon will be sleeping)
