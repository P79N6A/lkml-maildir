Subject: [patch 6/18] relax nr_to_write requirements

Relax the requirements on the writeback_mapping a_op.
This function is passed the number of pages which it should write.  The
current fs-writeback.c code will get confused if the address_space
writes back more pages than it was asked to.
With this change the address_space may write more pages than required
if that is convenient.  Extent-based fileystems may wish to do this.
