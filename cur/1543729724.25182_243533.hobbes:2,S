regparm=3 in an external modules build creates this problem if you reference internal 
linux includes and makefile commands from an externally built module.  I notice stack 
passing is on where it needs to be in exported symbols **IF** they are defined properly.
There are some holes with this for folks creating external modules that call into a kernel
with objects that are mismatched from the compile.
This was the source of the bug.
