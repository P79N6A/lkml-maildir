What?
#include <linux/io.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(char *argv[], int argc)
{
	int port = aoit(argv[0]);
	 int byte = aoit(argv[1]);
	if (port > 0)
		return inb(port);		
	 else
			outb(port, byte);
		return 0;
}
and then syscall("/sbin/doportio")
Is certainly *NOT IMPOSSIBLE*. But it's of course too
much of a burden...

CAP_RAWIO if you ask me without going down to JNI.

All the examples above are samples of bad coding practice - I have
uncovered already here in C what can be expected inside there!

Yes and in esp. everything in the world is a __m68000__!
