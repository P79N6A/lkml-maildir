AFAIK the thread created like above is a true kernel thread but in
general practice what I saw and used that by creating thread from
init_module, the thread first call daemonize which actually drops the
mm related to thread and then through reparent_to_init it makes init
as a parent of the thread/process newly created. So after daemonize
call current->mm becomes NULL and when the scheduling is going to be
done the previous_process->mm will be used as the current->mm and
creating thread like above is correct.
