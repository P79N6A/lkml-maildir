It depends on the architecture.
However, all 64 bit architectures have one thing in common.
There is so much address space available for both kernel and
userspace that we won't have to worry about a shortage for a
very long time.
Sure, people said that too when going from 16 bits to 32 bits,
but that was only a factor 2^16 difference.  This time it's the
square of the previous difference.
