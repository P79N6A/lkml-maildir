Yes.
Actually, in 2.4 lock_sock() is also semaphore and in some cases
(f.e. for stateless datagram sockets) it is used as pure semaphore.

What??? 8)8)
No, it makes it much easier. 8)
By the way:
1. lock_sock() is not much younger than cli()/sti().
2. cli()/sti() is not used by attended parts of networking for looong time,
   they are deprecated not yesterday too.

And this is redundant, to be honest. 8)

Yes, of course.

Actually, the last task is not a rocket science as well.
