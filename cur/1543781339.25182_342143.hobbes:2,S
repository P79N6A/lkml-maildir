I don't know what the purpose of this patch is but it copies the pre-LCD
version of the code in mach64_ct.c into the xlinit.c code of 2.6. This is
not the var_to_pll code. This code affects the display fifo and can
cause wrong image if incorrectly programmed, but has nothing to do with
initializing the chip.
The pre-LCD code caused several problems for both i386 and
non-i386 laptops, and should not be reused. Also, Geert Uytterhoeven
has said that he developed the pre-LCD by trial and and not by
design. The post-LCD code is derived from the XFree86 driver, it is
supposed to work fine if X works.
