Hi,
Olof Johansson had suggested that earlier, except that his patch used
if (unlikely(!x))
	return;
Performance was quite good, but not as good as having prefetch completely
disabled.  I got
# elements: 50, mean 851.263680, variance 24.561146, std dev 4.955920
compared to 860.823880 stdev 6.896914 with prefetch disabled.
thanks,
