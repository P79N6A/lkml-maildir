What's the status of that? It looks as though it would be better than
the "accessed in the last N seconds" metric that we've been playing
with, although it's possibly more intrusive?
Would it be practical to keep a non-resident set for each cgroup?

It would probably be better to reduce its background-reclaim high
watermark than to reduce its limit. If you do the latter, you risk
triggering an OOM in the cgroup if it turns out that it did need all
that memory after all.
