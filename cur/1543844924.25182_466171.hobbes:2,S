I don't know about reiserfs, but for ext3 writeback caching delays aren't a
problem per-se.  It's write *reordering* which matters.
And given that the jounal tends to be a single contiguous hunk of disk, the
probability that a journal block at LBA #N gets written before the commit
block at LBA #N+20 is probably fairly low.  There's block remapping of
course, but software journal wrapping might be a more likely cause of write
reordering.
And of course the time window is small - a few milliseconds per five
seconds, and not every five seconds at that.
Hand wavy, I know.  But I wouldn't pay 15% throughput for it..

Well, as I say, the absolute value of any delay doesn't really matter,
except you'd lose an additional seven seconds worth of work.  It's
write reordering which can damage the fs.
