Oh, do not talk about NT here. When I start dMail in NT (see headers of my
mail :-) then suddenly I feel that I just switched from PentiumII-350 to
486DX66 (if not 386DX33 :-). dMail is simple DOS program and it does not
do anything criminal (for DOS program that is): it just sits in tight loop
to show current time in statu bar. At lest in Linux I do not feel background
dMail even if I see dosemu eating almost 100% of cpu ...
P.S. I'm NOT talking about dMail itself -- it works great. Just MS Office
need few seconds to open up menu when there are idle dMail in the background.
And when I press letter I see it inserted in typed text after visible delay...
