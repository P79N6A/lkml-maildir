cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack
The third field is the timeout in seconds.
The fourth field is the state of the connection, if it's TIME_WAIT with
a large timeout then it's the list handling bug. (iirc it was TIME_WAIT
that showed the problem...)

The default tcp timeout is 5 days for esatblished connections.
There's a patch in patch-o-matic that enables you to tune the timeouts
without having to edit the source. Instructions on how to get
patch-o-matic are availiable on

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
