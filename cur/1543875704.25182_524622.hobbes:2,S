For the 'unknown control message' messages,
see:   "fix typo in svc_udp_recvfrom"  previously on
nfs@lists.sourceforge.net.
Fix is in -mm and below.
For "svc: bad direction" .... Don't know... garbage on the net maybe?
Or maybe not.  I have seen something like that before, but haven't
been able to pin it on anything yet.
