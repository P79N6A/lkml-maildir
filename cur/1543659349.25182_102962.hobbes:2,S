There is no problem currently, because of nobody uses errno value at
all (in the firmware loader), it is just that inline functions generated 
by syscallX() store error codes into errno...
Real problem is that firmware loader should use 
filp_open/vfs_read/filp_close (or sys_open/sys_llseek/sys_read/sys_close if 
you want to use fd interface, but filp_{open,close} and vfs_read are already 
exported for modules while sys_open/sys_llseek/sys_read are not).
As an alternative, do_mod_firmware_load should be standalone userspace
program executed through call_usermodehelper or something like that... 
Unfortunately we do not have an interface to distribute userspace binaries 
together with kernel (except initrd) yet, so it would require either
adding do_mod_firmware_load into module-init-tools, or some simillar
package required by 2.[56].x kernels.
Also adding "#define errno (current()->exit_code)" at the beginning of
sound_firmware.c (just below #define __KERNEL_SYSCALLS__) should do
the trick, but I do not recommend taking this path.
