Subject: [PATCH 3/3] sound: vmaster.c missing include of hda_local.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/28/451

Needed for the two prototypes, must include hda_codec.h as well
due to some dependencies between the headers.
sound/pci/hda/vmaster.c:230:5: warning: symbol 'snd_ctl_add_slave' was not declared. Should it be static?
sound/pci/hda/vmaster.c:329:21: warning: symbol 'snd_ctl_make_virtual_master' was not declared. Should it be static?
