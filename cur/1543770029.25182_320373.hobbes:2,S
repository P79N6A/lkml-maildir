Removing proc_check_root essentially removes any protection that 
namespaces provided in the first place.
Think of it like virtual memory.  You can fork off and create your own 
COW instance, and no one can see what you are doing unless they ptrace 
you or explicitly ask you.  The mountfd model allows for explicit 
handing off of vfsmounts between namespaces without allowing arbitrary 
access.

Yet even this doesn't allow userspace to define it's own policy for 
inter-namespace manipulation.

Worked out where?  Allowing this stuff to happen in /proc forces you to 
set this policy in the kernel.

Beware that due to the detached-subtrees bit, the locking became a bit 
ugly, requiring a global rw_lock for mntget/mntput.  I still haven't 
figured out a better way to keep per-vfsmounts counts and per-subtree 
counts in sync.
That said, the common case is a read lock, for shared access. Only on 
mnt_attach / mnt_detach (usually a slowpath anyway) do we require 
exclusive access.  This would have been a good candidate for brlocks if 
they were still around.
