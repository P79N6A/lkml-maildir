Yes the old slabtop that works on /proc/slabinfo works with SLQB (ie. SLQB
implements /proc/slabinfo).
Lin Ming recently also ported the SLUB /sys/kernel/slab/ specific slabinfo
tool to SLQB. Basically it reports in-depth internal event counts etc. and
can operate on individual caches, making it very useful for performance
"observability" and tuning.
It is hard to come up with a single set of statistics that apply usefully
to all the allocators. FWIW, it would be a useful tool to port over to
SLAB too, if we end up deciding to go with SLAB.
