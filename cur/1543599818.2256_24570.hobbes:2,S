Yes. I just tried it. The first warning thrown up for 2.4.8 was in
tun.c, when I did a make modules. Obviously it all depends on my
  .config as to what it finds!  I put in a asm(".error_here") instead of
BUG() so the compilation stops at every problem instead of warning and
continuing. Hence I don't kow the total. I can try and see ..
It's very late here (spain) so I don't trust myself to do much
hacking of code right now .. I corrected the tun.c code (it was
harmless) and posted the first bit of output a little while ago.
It should be down your mail client page a bit.
