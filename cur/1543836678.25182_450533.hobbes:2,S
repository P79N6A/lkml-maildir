Hi Andi,
	Please reconsider.  This isn't about being pretty, it's about not
having hidden side-effects, and having typechecking.

Agreed, but comment about it above the macros made me wary, so I checked
it.  No significant code difference with gcc >= 4.0, at least.

You mean the l and ll variants?  The 64 bit variants are rdmsrl and
rdtscll, not to be confused with rdtscl, which returns the lower 32
bits.  This confusion caused the x86_64 bug in gameport.c which the
patch comment mentioned (at least, seems to be a bug to me).
See why I want to fix these names?
So if you would prefer u64 rdtsc64(), u32 rdtsc_low(), u64 rdmsr64(int
msr), u32 rdmsr_low(int msr), I can convert everyone to that, although
it's a more invasive change...
Thanks,
Rusty.
