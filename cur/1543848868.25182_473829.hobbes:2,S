Please read again my original mail....
1) you need to create images with Rock Ridge
2) a correct implementation is prepared to deal with more recent versions 
	without a need for new changes.
So, if the implementation does not deal with the new version _without_ 
explicitely knowing about v1.12 it is still broken.
