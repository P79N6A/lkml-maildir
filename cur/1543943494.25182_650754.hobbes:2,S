Subject: Scheduler(?) regression from 2.6.22 to 2.6.24 for short-lived threads

Hi,
I ended up with a customer benchmark in my lap this week that doesn't
do well on recent kernels. :(
After cutting it down to a simple testcase/microbenchmark, it seems like
recent kernels don't do as well with short-lived threads competing
with the thread it's cloned off of. The CFS scheduler changes come to
mind, but I suppose it could be caused by something else as well.
The pared-down testcase is included below. Reported runtime for the
testcase has increased almost 3x between 2.6.22 and 2.6.24:
2.6.22: 3332 ms
2.6.23: 4397 ms
2.6.24: 8953 ms
2.6.24-git19: 8986 ms
While running, it'll fork off a bunch of threads, each doing just a little
work, then busy-waiting on the original thread to finish as well. Yes,
it's incredibly stupidly coded but that's not my point here.
During run, (runtime 10s on my 1.5GHz Core2 Duo laptop), vmstat 2  shows:

I.e. runqueue is 2, but only one cpu is busy. However, this still seems
true on the kernel that runs the testcase in more reasonable time.
Also, 'time' reports real and user time roughly the same on all kernels,
so it's not that the older kernels are better at spreading out the load
between the two cores (either that or it doesn't account for stuff right).
I've included the config files, runtime output and vmstat output at
http://lixom.net/~olof/threadtest/.
 I see similar behaviour on PPC as
well as x86, so it's not architecture-specific.
Testcase below. Yes, I know, there's a bunch of stuff that could be done
differently and better, but it still doesn't motivate why there's a 3x
slowdown between kernel versions...
