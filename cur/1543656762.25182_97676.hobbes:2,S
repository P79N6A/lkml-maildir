Thanks Dave,
	My ultimate goal is to help stabilize 2.5 by getting 
more people using this kernel tracker thereby increasing the 
patches and testing on lkml ;) 	
	This thread has answered most my questions and I am 
going to write up what I have learned to add it to the 
documentation on the site. As with most things in Linux Kernel 
development, dont ask to do it, just write it. Expect some
documentation soon...
	Hanna
