#include <hallo.h>
Has anybody succesfully used a SMP-Kernel with such a machine?
I have a ALR Q-SMP-PCI with 4 Pentium 166MMX CPUs.
Kernel 2.0.36 just hangs when it tries to start up the second processor.
Kernel 2.1.131 says
Booting processor 1 eip 2000
Not responding
Booting processor 2 eip 2000
Not responding
Booting processor 3 eip 2000
Not responding
Then it says that Pin 0,3,<One more,IIRC it was 12 or 13> from IO-APIC
isn't connected.
Then the kernel tries to setup the timers, first IO-APIC-Timer then
"set up timer as BP IRQ" (Both fail)
and then the Kernel Panics with
"IO-APIC + timer doesn't work!"
The Error-Messages aren't 100% correct because the Computer is at work and
i write this message at home. If the "original" messages are need i will
supply the infos on demand.
