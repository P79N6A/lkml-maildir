The same thing will happen.  You will always get people rushing to get
their projects into the kernel just before a feature freeze no matter
what date gets set.

It's only a rush because that's what people with their features are doing.
The deadline of October 31 was set at the kernel summit on Ottawa around
the middle of June.
The whole idea of shortening the feature development time is to (hopefully)
shorten the stabilisation time after, and hopefully get 2.6 out earlier.
This then means 2.7 can open earlier.
Although this means that there will be fewer features between each stable
version, hopefully the stable version series will stabilise earlier.
Oh, and Oct 31st is one deadline we're trying not to miss. 8)
