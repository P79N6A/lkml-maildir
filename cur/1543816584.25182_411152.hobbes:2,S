No, they're still a problem in ABI headers because they have defined  
visibility.  A userspace program that does not include <stdint.h>  
will not have those types put in its namespace.  Including <sys/ 
time.h> _cannot_ bring <stdint.> in automatically, that breaks the  
POSIX symbol visibility rules.
