There is a smaller workaround that is just to increase the number of symbols
used to make the compression by changing the "#define WORKING_SET". 
This should
be just a one liner.
The downside of the workaround would be a slightly increased compile time, but
it is not *absolutely* obvious that there are no hidden consequences as is
required for the stable series.
Anyway, since this is just a compile time bug and people compiling 
kernels will
probably search google when this happens and find the patch themselves, 
I don't
think that it is serious enough for -stable, and we might as well hold on a
little more till 2.6.14 is out.
