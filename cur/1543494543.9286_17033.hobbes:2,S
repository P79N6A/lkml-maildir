 Actually, he said the opposite: "My experience and some of my friends'
experience is that Linux is quite unreliable. Microsoft is *really*
unreliable but Linux is *worse*. In a non-PC environment, it just
won't hold up."
 His comments on Linux are only two paragraphs of a seven-page interview,
but they'll probably generate the most heat.

 And he does have a new baby in Inferno. Still, note that he said linux
had problems in a "non-PC environment". I don't know what he's tried
Linux on, but his current focus is on set-tops, embedded system, and so
forth. I can imagine that he'd feel Inferno better suited to such tasks.
