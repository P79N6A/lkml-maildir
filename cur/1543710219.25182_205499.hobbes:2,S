Kenji,
Your patch failed to apply apparently because all tabs got replaced by
blanks.  I fixed it by hand for now, but in the future, I'd appreciate
it if you could either fix your mailer config so it doesn't muck with
whitespace (or don't paste & cut patches if that's how the patch got
mangled).  As a last resort, send patches as a MIME attachment.

That should be OK.  The probe_irq_on() interface never was guaranteed
to work under all circumstances.

That's a good point but I doubt it's going to cause trouble because of
the history behind this interface (it's mostly needed for ISA
devices).  If it did, it wouldn't be hard to fix, but I'm not sure
it's worth bothering.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to get rid of
the interface altogether in the 2.7 timeframe (for ia64 and other
ISA-free platforms at least; I don't think it can be gotten rid of for
x86).
