I had (have ?) similar problem with a bt878 :
if I use bttv orverlay and do disk IO (a `grep toto /usr' for example), 
there quickly RISC corruption message and my log and also ext3 
corruption (that's why except for recovering epg data, I don't use 
anymore my card).
There were a similar report were someone and mozilla corruption when 
watching tv.
When using gradisplay, I don't saw faillure, but I don't try for a long 
time.
Jeremy do you use overlay or gradisplay ?
