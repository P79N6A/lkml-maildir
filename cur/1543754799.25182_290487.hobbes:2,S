Vanilla 2.6.10, though I've been seeing these problems since 2.6.8 or
earlier.  Netfilter running on all boxes, some utilizing SNAT, others
not -- none using MASQ.  This is from a box running no NAT at all,
although has some other filter rules:
# wc -l /proc/net/rt_cache ; grep dst_cache /proc/slabinfo
     50 /proc/net/rt_cache
ip_dst_cache       84285  84285
Also with uptime of 26 days.  
These boxes are all running the quagga OSPF daemon, but those that
are lightly loaded are not exhibiting these problems.
