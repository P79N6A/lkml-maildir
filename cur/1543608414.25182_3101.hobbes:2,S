The "cache_line_pad" is useless.  The __attribute__((aligned(N)))
is completely sufficient.

Separate sections are also not needed.  While you can't guarantee
adjacency, the object file *does* record the required alignment 
and that must be honored by the linker.
Now, separate sections do make sense for minimizing accumulated 
padding, but that is a separate issue.
