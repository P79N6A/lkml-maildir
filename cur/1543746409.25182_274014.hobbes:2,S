"at the cost of a small latency"
How much additional latency is added with this option enabled?
5ms? 10ms?
-> Use Interrupt Mitigation
   x CONFIG_TULIP_NAPI_HW_MITIGATION:
   x Use HW to reduce RX interrupts. Not strict necessary since NAPI 
reduces RX interrupts but itself. Although this reduces RX interrupts even at 
low levels traffic at the cost of a small latency. 
x
   x If in doubt, say Y.
