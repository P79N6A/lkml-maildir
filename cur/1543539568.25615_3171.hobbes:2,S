I am not sure that the rest of the list will agree with you. This is a
very dangerous attitude to be taking.
Linux is not computer science anymore. Linux is running thousands of
real-world systems. People depend on the stability of these systems.
People also make decisions based on their opinions, regardless of the
validity of those opinions. If the common opinion is that Linux has a
flaw, then people will do one of three things:
1) Continue merrily along regardless. This is highly unlikely in the case
   of administrators running large systems which support the success of
   large companies or institutions. And this is a common thing.
2) They will attempt to work around the problem themselves, probably in
   worse ways than the kernel people could come up with.
3) They will switch to something different that they believe does not
   contain the same flaw.
#3 is the most likely course of action. People seem to believe that Linux
is still used only by computer-savvies who are willing to fix problems on 
their own. This is not the case anymore. The average Linux user these days
considers himself intelligent if he can figure out how to compile a
package.
Your disregard for user opinion sounds like Microsoft's disregard for user
opinion.

Scott
