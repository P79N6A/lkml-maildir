Agreed, a new syscall looks less messy. I'll make sys_dup2() to allow 
installing in the non-sequential area, only if there's an fd already 
allocated. F_DUPFD will remain unchanged (that is, not allow 
non-sequential fds allocations).

Can you tell me how this can be a problem, and in which way making a 
random thing would help?
