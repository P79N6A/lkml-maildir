If a module is deleted between calls to s_seek() and that deletion is
before mod_nr then the caller has seen the deleted module but a later
module will transiently disappear.  I don't see how counting on a
linked list which is subject to deletion at any point can deliver
reliable results.  Seeing the old module is wrong but acceptable.  Not
seeing a module that still exists is wrong.
