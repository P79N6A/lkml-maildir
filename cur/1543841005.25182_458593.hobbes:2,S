x86-64 has always used the spinlock based version.

We've completely given up these kinds of micro optimization for spinlocks,
which are 1000x as critical as rwsems.  And nobody was able to benchmark
a difference.
It is very very likely nobody could benchmark a difference on rwsems either.
While I'm sure it's an interesting intellectual exercise to do these
advanced rwsems it would be better for everybody else to go for a single 
maintainable C implementation.
