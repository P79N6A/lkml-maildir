its still plugins no matter what. they just emulate "conventional filesystem"
behavior for VFS, but at some point you might want just to scrap VFS..
if you'd like to.
And I honestly dont understand whats the other Christoph's worries are about.
Its got perfomance. Its there. It can emulate "conventional filesystem" behaviour,
 for legacy apps. Thouse two that are currently crippled by metas, we 
are so happy arguing about, will get fixed fast. Thats a point where you could
happily STOP and live with your happy "conventional filesystem emulation", yet
enjoying perfomance aspects (if perfomance hurts you, do not compile reiserfs,
just like one big-red distro does, nobody would not complain. except your hard-drive
mechanics sick of seeks).
 But most people would not stop, and its good.
Yes, I think it would be nice to have this infrastructure in VFS. Technically.
But its not possible, cause of "committee clusterfuck". Socially. Stupidly.
