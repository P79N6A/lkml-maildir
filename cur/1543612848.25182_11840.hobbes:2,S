I bet you have more than 100MB RAM, so you measure memory performance
instead of disk performance in the block reads and writes. Same for seeks.
Don't do that. Always use at least twice you ram size if you're interested
in seeing your disk speed.
Newer bonnies warn you about it. The current release is 1.2.

The char reads/writes seem to suffer glibc overhead.
You can use the _unlocked variants with option -u and see whether this makes
a difference.
