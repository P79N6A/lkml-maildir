Please see if reverting pm-acquire-device-locks-on-suspend-rev-3.patch helps
and if it doesn't, please see if reverting git-acpi.patch helps.
Everyone having suspend/hibernation problems with this kernel, please check
if reverting reverting pm-acquire-device-locks-on-suspend-rev-3.patch (and the
fixes) helps first.
Thanks,
