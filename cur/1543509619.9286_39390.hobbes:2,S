Hi,
thanks for your participation.
Right now I'm limited to follow your wishes. The machine, espescially
the drive is overheated. I 'll send you the info's you'll wanted.
Also I have the strace's at hand.
But this will follow tomorrow in the aftenoon since I have to follow
other things...
But, why is it not so strange 'hfs' ??
Well, one point I HAVE to say, when you take a fully SCSI-REV 2 dev then
it works !!
Only on my old MO it gives such strange behaves like that.
The other MO for comparisons works ok.
Thanks anyway
Andreas
