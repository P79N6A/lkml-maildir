I agree, but I have not seen this done before, can you point me at an 
example of how to structure this?

I don't have a problem adding additional trace points to the example 
code.  However, anyone trying to use the code for some real purpose will 
want to tweak the code based on their needs, at a minimum to select what 
data to trace.  I don't think we gain much by adding more to the example 
other than to make it more complicated.  I am strong believer in keeping 
example code as simple as possible.
If you are suggesting adding a separate feature for process tracing (not 
just an example) that is a good idea also.  But is should be a separate 
patch, not part of the trace patch.
