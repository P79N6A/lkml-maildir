It's fine for now .. One step at a time..

The workqueues don't really need full blown transitive PI. So without
that your back to the rt_mutex_setprio function .. Which could be
renamed ..
Here was my attempt years ago , 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/31/288
Looking back on it, I'm not sure what users I was planning to implement
along with it .. I'm sure I was thinking "There must be other blocking
primitives that could use this.." , but now I don't think there are ..
Everything pretty much runs through the rt mutex.. workqueues are just
"dancing" , or changing priorities up/down which is really only the
lowest level of what the rt-mutex does.
