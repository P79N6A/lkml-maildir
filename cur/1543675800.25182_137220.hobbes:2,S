It used to be caught by the generic DMA driver that would just run with
BIOS settings. This approach unfortunately also tended to grab devices
that didn't work with just BIOS settings so I took it out and just left
a table of known OK devices.
I'll add the toshiba one back and I've also pinged Toshiba to see if
they will give me the docs to support it properly.
