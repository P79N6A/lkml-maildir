A have similar situation, one difference: I get blank screen during
resume from suspend to ram. Also sometimes, like You, system turns on
back itself.

The same. Suspend to disk die on this message:
http://www.unixy.pl/maciek/download/kernel/2.6.29-rc1/pc/img_0002.jpg
(this is during go to suspend to disk, NOT resume)
I try bisect, but I got many other problems, like this:

So, I cannot finish bisect.
