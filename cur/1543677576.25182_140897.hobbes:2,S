Hi!
 /* XXX this driverfs stuff should probably go elsewhere later -john
*/
 static struct sys_device device_i8253 = {
-       .name           = "rtc",
        .id             = 0,
-       .dev    = {
-               .name   = "i8253 Real Time Clock",
-       },
+       .cls    = &rtc_sysclass,
 };
...but i8253 is *not* real time clock. Its clock since
bootup. Realtime clock is near battery-backed CMOS RAM, its driver is
linux/drivers/char/rtc.c...
