Just use a basic hysteresis device:
When allocating resources:
if (resource > limit + delta)
	disable_process();
When freeing resources:
if (resource < limit - delta)
	enable_process();
If the delta is set to something reasonable (say 1 or 2 pages), then  
the process will only be rescheduled when it gets enough free RSS  
(one page to satisfy its latest request and a few spare).  Even  
better, you could use a running average of "time between RSS- 
triggered-pauses" to figure out how much memory you should keep free.  
Pseudocode below:
[Tuneables]
unsigned int time_quantum_factor;
unsigned int limit;
unsigned int max_delta;
[Per-process state]
unsigned int pages;
unsigned int delta;
unsigned long long last_limit_time;
[When allocating resources]
if (pages > limit + delta) {
	int time_factor = log2(now - last_limit_time)
		- time_quantum_factor;
	last_limit_time = now;
	
	if (time_factor < 0 && delta < max_delta)
		delta <<= 1;
	else if (time_factor > 0 && delta > 1)
		delta >>= 1;
	
	put_process_to_sleep();
}
[When freeing resources]
if (resource < limit - delta)
	enable_process();
The effect of this code would be that the RSS code would avoid  
rescheduling a process more often than every 1<<time_quantum_factor  
microseconds.  It would attempt to provide a safe hysteresis delta  
such that the process would have enough pages free that it could  
probably run for at least the minimum amount of time.  Note that the  
code would _only_ have an effect if the process is already about to  
sleep on an RSS limit, otherwise that code path would never get hit.   
Obviously it's possible to adjust this algorithm to react more slowly  
or quickly by adjusting the shift values, but it should work well  
enough for a beta as-is.
Cheers,
