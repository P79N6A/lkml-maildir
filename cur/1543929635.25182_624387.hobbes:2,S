grumble.
These:

and these:

really don't need to exist.  All they do is make the code harder to read.
Think of the poor reader who sees this:
		status = READ_SC_PORT(port, SR);
and then goes madly searching for "SR".  After a while, our confused reader
might think to go look at the definition of READ_SC_PORT, after which our
reader will emulate a C preprocessor in wetware and will eventually construct
then hunt down RD_PORT_SR and will then hopefully remember what the heck he was
trying to do in the first place.
This sucks.
Code is written once and is read a thousand times.  Please optimise for
reading.
