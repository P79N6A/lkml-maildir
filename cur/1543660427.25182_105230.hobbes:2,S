OK, done.  Here's my #3 submission.  Some great
feedback from you guys.  Mods are down to:
  o Documentation/x86-hal.txt      # added file
  o include/asm-i386/if.h          # added file (only used for VM)
  o arch/i386/Kconfig              # added one menu entry
  o arch/i386/Makefile             # added one ifdef..endif
  o arch/i386/boot/Makefile        # added one ifdef..endif
