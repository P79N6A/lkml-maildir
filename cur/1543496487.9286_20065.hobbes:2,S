The original looks correct to me.  If you remap the `complete' VMA,
(addr - vma->vm_start) will be zero and the offset will remain
unchanged.  If however, you remap only the trailing part of a file
VMA, the new offset will have to be adjusted by a positive value.  Am
I missing sth ?

Yes, but note that mremap() is used quite extensively for anonymous
pages, because realloc() uses it for large reallocations (I've
verified that e.g. GNU Emacs does these quite often).
