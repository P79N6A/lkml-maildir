Hello Alan,
While developing the Linux Trace Toolkit, I've seen this bug occur on
at least the i386 and the PPC. I had written down a description of
how time-keeping is done in the kernel in order to get to the bottom of
the problem. I'm not sure if this is still acurate, but it's a starting
point nevetheless:

Cheers,
Karim

This behavior sets in after the box is up for some period of time. I don't think this is related to the 686a configuration reset bug.

I would like to get to the bottom of this problem, but am not familiar with this part of the timing infrastructure. Has anyone seen this bug before? Would using a different locking mode (SMP  vs none SMP, or wahtever) possibly help this problem? Is there a document online describing how this works in Linux?
