No doubt.  I'd still like to hear from Greg or Pat about what the
concurrency rules are supposed to be, or were intended to be.
Note also that I said the *bus's* suspend/resume method.  For PCI, we
have some protection since the PCI suspend/resume methods won't call
the individual pci driver's suspend/resume until pci_dev->driver is
set, which happens after the pci driver's probe routine has returned
(but of course the store to pci_dev->driver can get reordered on
some architectures since there is no barrier).
However, pci_dev->driver only gets cleared *after* the driver's remove
method returns.  Thus it would be quite possible for a PCI device to
have its suspend/resume methods called while another CPU is in its
remove method.
I think that what has saved us to some extent is that we only do
suspend/resume on UP machines so far.
Regards,
Paul.
