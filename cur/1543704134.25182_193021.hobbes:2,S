Please excuse my potentially very stupid questions....
In AS, are there any sorts of "pressure levels" which indicate how many 
read and write blocks are pending?  Perhaps AS itself could be modified 
to strongly favor writes once some water mark of available pages (page 
cache, right?) has been reached.
The main idea behind AS is to increase throughput at the expense of 
additional latency.  It certainly wouldn't hurt us if occasionally there 
was a sudden burst of well-ordered writes.
I'm assuming that AS attempts to order reads and writes in ascending 
block number, right?  Why not order I/O's by ascending block number 
regardless of whether they're reads or writes, especially when the write 
pressure reaches a certain point?
Also, what kind of other system load was going on when the capture was 
happening?  A kernel compile?  Is there any feedback from the process 
scheduler to AS which indicates that an interactive task is what is 
doing the writes?
It seems to me that video playback would be helped by AS.  If capture is 
hurt by AS, that would be a shame.  Who wants to have to reboot or 
change /proc parameters to switch between record and playback?
But then again, anyone doing professional video editing is not likely to 
be doing a kernel compile in the background.  :)
