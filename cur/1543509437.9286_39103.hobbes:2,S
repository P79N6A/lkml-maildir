I resist a bit the idea to explode the machine - I probably would have a lot
of extra parts afterwards. But I tried the scanpci and it showed a lot of
'Compaq unknown' devices. I think they are Compaq's proprietry asics and
getting datasheets may be hard or what'd you say. Anyway, here's the list if
you could read something from it:
pci bus 0x0 cardnum 0x00 function 0x0000: vendor 0x0e11 device 0xae6c
  Compaq  Device unknown
pci bus 0x0 cardnum 0x00 function 0x0001: vendor 0x0e11 device 0xae6c
  Compaq  Device unknown
pci bus 0x0 cardnum 0x0c function 0x0000: vendor 0x104c device 0xac16
  Texas Instruments  Device unknown
pci bus 0x0 cardnum 0x0c function 0x0001: vendor 0x104c device 0xac16
  Texas Instruments  Device unknown
pci bus 0x0 cardnum 0x0e function 0x0000: vendor 0x0e11 device 0xae69
  Compaq  Device unknown
pci bus 0x0 cardnum 0x0e function 0x0001: vendor 0x0e11 device 0xae33
  Compaq  Device unknown
pci bus 0x0 cardnum 0x0e function 0x0002: vendor 0x0e11 device 0xa0f8
  Compaq  Device unknown
pci bus 0x1 cardnum 0x00 function 0x0000: vendor 0x5333 device 0x8c01
  S3 ViRGE/MX
Texas devices are PC-Card controllers, I think.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything.
