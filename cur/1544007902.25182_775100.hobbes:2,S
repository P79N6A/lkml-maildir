hah I fully understand now. I've been blind. There's no better way to
go than the current one for
someone here who recently got hired at Redhat even if he doesn't
deserve it for real.
I hope some other people are able to convince me about OSS again. I
have alot respect of
ffmpeg people actually. Writing v4l drivers is damn easy actually
callbacks here callbacks there
learning some structs and dumping data 1:1 to userland and someone is
done already.
This is the second project which goes that way, the first one was
polite enough to just take my
code and remove the copyrights .. after noticing this - after a year-
I got a nice reply that the work
was inspired by even when containing the same comments...
this is my last email to LKML, even when continuing to support Linux I
won't loose focus at other
operating systems. Thanks for teaching me about GPL stuff, I now have
more faith into the BSD
license if at all in the OSS area.
