Greetings!  Here are the contiguous lines from kern.log:
Mar 21 01:14:47 intech9 kernel: eth0: bogus packet: status=0x80 nxpg=0x57 size=1270
Mar 21 01:14:49 intech9 kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000
Mar 21 01:14:49 intech9 kernel: current->tss.cr3 = 02872000, %%cr3 = 02872000
Mar 21 01:14:49 intech9 kernel: *pde = 00000000
Mar 21 01:14:49 intech9 kernel: Oops: 0000
Mar 21 01:14:49 intech9 kernel: CPU:    0
Mar 22 12:30:08 intech9 kernel: klogd 1.3-3#33.1, log source = /proc/kmsg started.
Why would this have not been included, would you happen to know?  In
any case, I understand that its pretty much impossible to debug now,
right?  dmesg wrapped around by the time I got to it (I seem to be
having a lot of ethernet bogus packet messages, as shown above.  I've
chalked this up to the heavy traffic during the amanda backup, but
maybe something is wrong here too/instead?)
Thanks again!
