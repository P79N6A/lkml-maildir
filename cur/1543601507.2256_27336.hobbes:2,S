No, nothing with 2.4.10-pre9 + patch-rml-2.4.10-pre9-preempt-kernel-1 and 
your MMX/3Dnow! fix.
2.4.10-pre10 + patch-rml-2.4.10-pre10-preempt-kernel-1 seems to be a winner!
See my results below.

Yes, but no crash or oops for me.
"Only" some "stalls" during MPEG/Ogg-Vorbis playback (2-5 sec) :-(

I think you are right.

I saw it with "top" at the first line (but only some few percent).
It was during untarring some mid-sized archives (DRI) which took normally ~10 
sec, but with kswap and 2.4.9-pre9+your patches ~30 sec. Even "sync" needed 
some additional seconds.
Are there some reschedule/context switch (kernel lock release) statements 
missing in ReiserFS?
Is this possible? Chris?

I am very happy with patch-rml-2.4.10-pre10-preempt-kernel-1.

So look at my latest numbers. This time preempt only, sorry.
If you need 2.4.10-pre10 only, too please ask.

I do. Or better, one of my friend's father will do some digital video editing 
with Linux:-)

It is.

Sadly 2-5 seconds at the beginning of dbench and during bonnie++ block 
operations (huge IO pressure, ~20% system, 3-5% user, 116308 kilobytes paged 
out).

Yes, nearly the same.

Is this a ReiserFS only problem? Uninteruptable IO?

One more.

No crashes for me only the stalls.
