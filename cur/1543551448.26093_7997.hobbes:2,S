hi all,
For dma transfers to/from user space buffer, one need to lock that user
space buffer so that it won't be swaped out. and also
its bus address is obtained by call virt_to_bus and then this bus address
is written to dma controller.
but do we explicitly need to map that user buffer into kernel space by
calling kmap after obtaining the user buffer's page struct??
thanks.
