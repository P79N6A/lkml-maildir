There is a fourth setting, the SO_KEEPALIVE socket option, which
also must be enabled explicitly by the application to enable keepalives.
It defaults to off.  Your application sets this, so all is fine so far.

Your test case is questionable, because you do not receive even one
ACK in established state, thus the tp->rcv_tstamp variable has no
way to get initialized.  The only ACK you receive is the one in
response to the connection setup SYN, and we don't initialize
tp->rcv_stamp for that ACK.
The keepalive time checks absolutely require that tp->rcv_tstamp
has a valid value, and until you process an ACK in ESTABLISHED
state it does not.
If you send successfully or receive successfully at least one byte
over the connection, and thusly process at least one ACK in
ESTABLISHED state, I think you'll find that the keepalives behave
properly.
