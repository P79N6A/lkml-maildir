IMO the best rule is "enable TCQ if and only if 100% of the channel 
supports TCQ".
So, two drives on the same channel can do TCQ, if and only if they both 
support TCQ.  That's a big benefit of bus release, after all, 
simultaneously servicing multiple drives.  The device-select and service 
interrupt semantics are annoying but doable.
