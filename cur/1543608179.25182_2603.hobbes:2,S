I decided it would be nice to see the actual swap io as well.   since 
allocating and writing and reading are two different things.

    (max   24508)

   (max   118132)
http://safemode.homeip.net/bi-swap.png
    (max   24536)	
finally, i redid the swap one i have posted before.  This time it has correct 
scaling.  Because of this you'll see a final dropoff of the aa's graph to 0, 
disregard it,  as well as all of the 0 data in the other graphs as they're 
there to keep scale correct.  Everything after 52 seconds in the aa graphs is 
filler.

    (max   290740)
All of these are larger than before due to the larger dimensions of the graph 
files.  feel free to mirror them if i end up not being fast enough.
