I will patch it and find out if it buys anything. I am not hopeful
either.

We are re-writing mpage_writepages() anyway for supporting delayed
and multiblock allocation. So I will talk to Suparna and see if we
can do this also. But this requires more calls to figure out, if we
need block allocation and then start the transaction. (getblock(READ)
followed by getblock(WRITE) after starting transaction). Isn't it ?

Its beyond my capabilities :(
