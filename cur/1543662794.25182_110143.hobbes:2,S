No. Wraparound of unsigned types is well-defined. -1UL must be the
largest possible unsigned long value, which must consist of only 1
bits (except for possible padding bits).
Of course, no machines with ones-complement (or padding bits, or
integer trap representations, or any of the other ISO braindamages)
exist, so this is mostly irrelevant anyway.
