Hmm, I tried this, and it works with 'strings /dev/stdin < tmpfile' but
not 'cat tmpfile | strings /dev/stdin' which is sort of wierd.
I suppose you could always either:
a) fix 'strings' so that it accepts a '-' parameter to read from stdin
b) write a special-purpose 'strings | grep | sed' replacement tool for
   this purpose (or even include the binoffset part and link with zlib
   to do the decompression part).  No idea how hard it would be.  As
   for speed, almost anything would be faster in-memory than writing
   out the temp file.
Cheers, Andreas
