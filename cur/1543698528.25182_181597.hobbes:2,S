Most (all?) Linux implementations make use of a large area
of memory that is mapped 1:1 (with a constant offset) from
kernel virtual space to physical space.  Kernel memory is
allocated in this virtual area.  If the processor supports
some form of large pages in the TLB, this 1:1 area uses the
large pages ... so it would require some major surgery to
remap portions of this area, and would have a negative effect
on performance (since you'd take more TLB misses).  It might
even be a correctness issue if the structures in this area
were needed to handle small page TLB faults in the area itself.
