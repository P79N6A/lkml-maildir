I'm not entirely sure this is the appropriate list for this question
(though I am subbed).  If not, please redirect me appropriately.  TYK.
I have just run across a video capture card my dad had.  He never uses it,
and if I can get it to work under Linux, I'm likely to "reallocate" it.
I'm wondering if it is supported by the Video for Linux drivers in the
kernel (or any third party software available elsewhere).
It's a ComputerEyes 1024, by Digital Vision, Inc.  The FCC ID on the card
is IHC0007.  It's a 16 bit ISA card (fairly long), with RCA, S-Video, what
appears to be 9 pin VGA inputs, and a bank of 8 DIP switches.
Thanks.
