Yes. We've found network driver bugs which only showed up when an IOMMU
has been active -- and were painful to diagnose because they involved
DMA going wrong. It happens when drivers make mistakes with the DMA
mapping APIs.
With this debug facility, we can find such problems on _any_ hardware,
and get a sane report about what's wrong.
