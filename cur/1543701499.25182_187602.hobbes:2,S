I totally agree with you. However at the time when this driver was written 
it was only intended for Intel i386 base architecture. And furthermore 
AMD64 wasn't even available at that stage.
At this point of time I think fixing this driver for 32bit architecture now 
is far more important than addressing 64bit architecture, don't you agree 
Andi ?
