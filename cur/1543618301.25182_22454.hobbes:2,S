Q: Is there any function in the kernel which I can call
safely from a module to print debug message on the console
screen?
I don't want to use printk for some reasons. One of them is
that I want messages to appear on the screen immediately,
even from interrupt processing routines. Another is to be
able to see messages until the system freezes completely in
case of software or hardware bug.
Thank you.
