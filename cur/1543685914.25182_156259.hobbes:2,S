Hi
Building a kernel with the sis acceleration and fb modules built in instead of 
as modules makes the machine always boot in a framebuffer mode on a sis 630 
chipset. This happens even if I specify vga=normal with my bootloader. While 
this isn't a major problem in itself; when X starts up, because some memory 
is apparently already allocated to the FB, the colours are all a little off. 
Building it as modules does not have this issue, and building vesa fb into 
the kernel also does not have this problem.
