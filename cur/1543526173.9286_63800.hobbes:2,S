Subject: PATCH 2.3.46: ll_rw_blk compile fixes

Linus,
Here is a tested patch which fixes the build error with ll_rw_blk
in 2.3.46...  Just a typo:   s/back_merges_fn/back_merge_fn/
I also killed an possibly-uninit-var warning by setting
__entry = NULL, and make generic_plug_device non-static
because it is listed publicly in linux/blkdev.h.
Regards,
	Jeff
