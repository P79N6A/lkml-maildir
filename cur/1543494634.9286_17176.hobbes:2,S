  This can be considered good or bad depending on design philosophy /
idiosyncrasy. Unix programmers consider the ability to pass pieces
of data in fast and reliable manner between processes without any special
userspace-visible locks or synchronization to be an advantage of this
model.

  This is why X clients talk to X server over one file descriptor with
already multiplexed events, and can add other file descriptors to their
loops when necessary.
