   tg3.c:v0.90 (Feb 25, 2002)
   DEBUG: counter 6592
   DEBUG: smallest_limit is 10000
   DEBUG: read_partno returned -19
   tg3: Problem fetching invariants of chip, aborting.
   
   smallest_limit is naturally 10k since limit isn't decremented...
   
Oh I see... ok so it gets the vital product data, but it
cannot find the part number string.
Please, simply make tg3_read_partno always return 0 (or,
alternatively, make tg3_get_invariants() ignore tg3_read_partno's
return value).  It should just work, this string is not critical to
the driver's operation.
