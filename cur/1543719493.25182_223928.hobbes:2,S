Hi Chris, 
This seems to be a normal allocation (which can wait), it really
looks the system was out of memory. 
Can you stick a call to show_free_areas() in mm/page_alloc.c after 
        printk(KERN_NOTICE "__alloc_pages: %u-order allocation failed (gfp=0x%x/%i)\n",
               order, gfp_mask, !!(current->flags & PF_MEMALLOC));
so we know the state of the memory areas when it happens again.
Also turn on /proc/sys/vm/vm_gfp_debug.
