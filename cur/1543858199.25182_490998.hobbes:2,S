My bug 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6419
Today I found that my computer hang problem could be just a problem with
via-rhine II.
I got exactly the same problem describe on 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=245398;msg=107
I had transfer by eth0 (via-rhine II), about 3500 files, about 15 Giga
bytes and when rsync over ssh stops transfer (eth0 has got problems), I
could press ctrl-c , abort rsync restart network , and continue the
rsync.
Or just restart network which remove via-rhine modules and reinsert it.
But if I left the computer with rsync stopped after some minutes
computer hangs.
netstat -i also give me some 2 or 3 TX-ERR s 
Any ideas to test this ?  
Thanks,
