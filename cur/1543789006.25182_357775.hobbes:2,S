Patch looks correct to me from a purely logical perspective. (IOW I read that file first time :)
But since interval is passed as a parameter to the usb_fill_int_urb() function,  I think it is more natural to remove the recalculation from usb_fill_int_urb() - If caller passes a parameter and has enough info to determine its value, it makes sense for the caller to pass in the right value and the callee to just take it as it is.
Not a big deal anyway though.
