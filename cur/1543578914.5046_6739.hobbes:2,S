Just built a new system with Linux-2.4.0.
Motherboard (MSI 694D-AR) has Via Apollo Pro chipset, those IDE drives seem
fine.  Board also has a promise PDC20265  RAID/ATA100 controller.  On each
channel of this controller I have an IBM 45 GB ATA100 drive as master.
(hde and hdg?).  BIOS sees these drives fine.  Linux only see hde and never
hdg (ide[012] but not ide3).  I thought I'd post it here, in case anyone
else knew the answer right away.  
Second question:  Does the RAID functionality of this device work under
linux?  If so, is it better than LVM or MD?
