I would be inclined to say it's not safe not from a code perspective but 
an administration perspective.  If you make a change as significant as 
the file system format but don't test it until you reboot the box six 
months from now (when you aren't thinking about how you changed it six 
months ago) problems are likely to happen.  Could be a simple typo or 
something else, but it can definitely come back to bite you in the 
backside.  Granted, if you forgot to change your fstab to ext3, you'd 
still boot and be fine running as ext2, you just never can tell what 
could happen.  Murphy always likes to visit on those occasions.
