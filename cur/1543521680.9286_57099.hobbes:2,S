Hi Folks,
This might look very silly as I am learning the
kernel internals just now. Is it possible that
I can create a module that works with any
version of the kernel ( for 2.2.xx kernels and beyond ) without meddling with the kernel.
How do I do it without changing the config
options and recompiling the kernel if there is
any chance of doing it ??
Or I am thinking of something which is not 
possible at all ??
I would like to write a module which is 
precompiled and which can be dynamically loaded
with any version of the kernel without any 
recompilation of the kernel. Is this possible??
Thanks
regards
	khader
