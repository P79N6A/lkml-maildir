it might make sense to report this to the hw vendor as well, as these
latencies dont occur at _every_ IDE DMA, it might be some sort of
chipset (or BIOS) bug they might want to see resolved as well (if this
isnt a ship-and-forget vendor). 2 msec stalls are not nice to a fair
number of applications.
