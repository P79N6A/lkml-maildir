Here was one bugfix in 2.2.13pre15 which change the phone number size to 32
in all structs (because of problems with some call by call prefixes).
Unfortunatly this fix forgot to set a new version for the structs, so
isdnctrl don't complain about this.
Fix is simple: recompile utils
In the next patch I increment the version  numbers, so a old util package
give your a warning about this. But a recompile is need in evry case.
