It happens because someone on the list has the virus.  The virus, among
other thing, harvests the email addresses to forge the From: header.
So they (probably multiples of them) run their unpatched and virus-infected
Outlook.  Each of them both generates email to all the addresses they see
and each of those emails is "From" one of the other addresses they see.
So it harvests the current inbox, and does a splatter mailing.  When the
mail servers see the email and bounce it, it is bounced to your address
instead of the real senders'.
Shame there are people that think they are smart enough to play in this
space (LKML) and dumb enough to open an email attachment that they don't
fully understand/appreciate.
Further stupidity is using the "preview pane".  In Outlook, the preview pane
"opens" the email, even if you are doing a left-click delete.  Since some of
the viruses (and almost all of the spam) will validate the email account as
interactively in use when you open it, they get hammered extra-hard.

I've noticed this too. I get around 100 mails/day of the new "security
update". And then I get 50 more which tell's me that some message could
not be delivered, which is of course a lie. None of the mail's contain
"To: ...snip..." and I think this happens because my mail adress is in
LKML.
