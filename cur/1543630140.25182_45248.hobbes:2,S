Since no one has answer to my question, I wish to add some extra data.
>The system can boot from any bus, download and run the kernel.

>(NFS server timeout, - looks like no interrupts are coming from

The above assumption was checked by mounting the local file system. It is
true, no interrupts are coming from the Ethernet card inserted in slots ##
1,2,3,6 after kernel initialization.
It should be a kernel BUG, since the same card in same slot is working
before kernel starts (Etherboot is working excellent). In order to make a
fair comparison I tested the latest 2.5.15 kernel too (with acpismp=force).
The result was the same.
Again, it is Intel E7500 chipset, which seems to have some problems @ Linux.
I tried to search through this mail list, but did not find complaints about
missing PCI interrupts on this platform.
Any comments gurus can make?
