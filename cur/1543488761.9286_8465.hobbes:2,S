Ah, this is the reason we don't reject the packets before entering in
tcp_input.c. Very well, OK, at least that now make sense to me.

I don't understand this...

You mean that we should decrease the mss if our rcvbuf is low? The deadlock
happens also with 3 byte of data in the packet so I don't think it's
enough.
I am looking now at the tcp trace of the deadlock. Now I have my patch
applyed so it doesn't deadlock anymore. See it:

Should the receiver offer a so high window and mss even if the rcvbuf is 1008?
