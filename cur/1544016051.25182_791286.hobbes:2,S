Should this explain why ssh is killed?

It is very subtle approach. Consider the case when you have a pool of
threads/processes which are created and released on demand, there are
several such pools for different servers and you do know which one
will very likely being guilty.
Who should adjust the scores for newly created processes? Who should
check that processes in the first group have negative oom ajustment and
in the second group a positive value? Who determines when its time to
ajust the scores?

It is not really costly, since most of the time we skip an entry and do
not lock the task and do not calculate its badness value. No one scares
that 'ps ax' is costly because it has to run through all the processes.
Messing with the scores is actually more expensive since we have to lock
the task and perform a calculus. I do not say it is wrong, but it is
much more complex task to being stable compared to simple task selection
by its name. It is what is used and what people expect to have (that's
actually why it was implemented :) and not to write some daemons to
monitor the clients and appropriate processes or change the code of the
servers.
