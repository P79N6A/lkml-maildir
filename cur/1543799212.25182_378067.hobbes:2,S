Well, I miss a version of kmem_cache_alloc()/kmem_cache_free() that wont play 
with IRQ masking.
The local_irq_save()/local_irq_restore() pair is quite expensive and could be 
avoided for several caches that are exclusively used in process context.
(Not speaking of general caches of course, but caches like dentry_cache, filp, 
...)
