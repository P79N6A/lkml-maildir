FYI: The Intel/DOE ASCI Red system (>1 TFLOPS) delivered user-to-user
messaging of < 5us.  With a tail wind, peak point-to-point data rates,
delivered from a user-mode buffer into another user-mode buffer anywhere
else on the system were just shy of 400 megabytes/second (actual rates
could be affected by several factors -- obviously).
