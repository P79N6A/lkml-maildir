No, it isn't. That was my original point: you can write "firmware" into
it, but it has no effect. This probably was a side-effect of the "make
firmware mode not default" patch from a year ago.
But the real question is: what is firmware mode good for today? Is there
a single machine where firmware mode once worked, but swsusp does not
work today?

Fine with me. I think it cannot work since ~one year (when we changed
the default from "firmware if available" to "shutdown always", the code
piece cited above) and nobody complained until now, so it won't be
missed IMO.
