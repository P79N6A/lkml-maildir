You don't need ide-cd to burn cds in 2.6 so the easiest fix is to just stop 
using ide-cd.  Anyway,  here is the buggy code that causes the problem:
drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.c
895:         spin_lock_irqsave(&ide_lock, flags);
896:         while (HWGROUP(drive)->handler) {
897:                 HWGROUP(drive)->handler = NULL;
898:                 schedule_timeout(1);
899:         }
The fix is quite complicated and I don't know how to do it correctly.  :/
regards,
dan carpenter
