When did you start seeing this? This code has been there as far back as
2.6.7 (the earliest 2.6 kernel I still have laying around) and as far
back as Ingo's realtime-preempt-2.6.9-mm1-U10. Maybe the tracing didn't
start picking this up till later, or that you were just lucky that no
contention was happening on that lock.
