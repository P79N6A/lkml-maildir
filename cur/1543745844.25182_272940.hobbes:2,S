It's still in Documentation/computone.txt, and if someone wants to do 
seroious work on an orphaned driver, I assume he'll start with reading 
the driver and documentation.

MAINTAINERS does not cover all drivers.
It's not about being honest or about hiding broken code, but adding 
let's say fifty entries for no longer supported drivers isn't of any 
practical value.
At least I'm checking MAINTAINERS for people who want to receive the 
patches I send today, not for people who have worked on the driver at 
some time in the past. Adding information about orphaned drivers to this 
file simply makes it harder to find whether valid entries covering the 
driver in question exist.
If someone steps up and wants to generate and maintain a driver status 
document that would be fine with me. But this would require a serious 
amount of work and is more than just adding a few orphaned drivers to 
MAINTAINERS.
