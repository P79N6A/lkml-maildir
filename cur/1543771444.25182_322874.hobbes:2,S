My mistake. Thanks for correcting me.

Out of interest, I did do some tests a while back that showed
16K is good for TCP over loopback bandwidth on a few different
types of CPUs (P3, Xeon, Opteron...).
IIRC 32K may have been slightly faster, but not enough to warrant
that size allocation.
Bandwidth for smaller sizes dropped off quite significantly,
although I'm not sure if that would have been from the actual
memory copy overhead or increased per-'something' overhead in the
network code. If the latter, that would suggest at least in theory
it could use noncongiguous physical pages.

Sure. Although we should try to not use higher order allocs if
possible of course. Even with a fallback mode, you will still be
putting more pressure on higher order areas and thus degrading
the service for *other* allocators, so such schemes should
obviously be justified by performance improvements.
