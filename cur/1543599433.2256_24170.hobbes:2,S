Subject: 2.4.9ac3 fails to boot (due to agpgart)...

This is an rcc/serverworks IIIHE-sl box (dual pIII-1ghz) with root on a
aic7xxx controller integrated on the mainboard...
as soon a the kernel gets to initializing the agpgart. the message:
"posted write buffer flush took more than three seconds"
begins scrolling down the screen...
the last line before it happens is:
"maximum memory available for agp is 816MB"
which seems like a reasonable number (the machine has 1GB)
alt-sysrq b will still reboot the machine at that point...
disabling agpgart support eliminaates the issue...
