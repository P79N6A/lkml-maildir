I did answer it. But again: yes I think it makes sense in theory
to make them read only.
Just we cannot do it right now on i386/x86-64 due to the reasons I lined out
in my previous mail.

It is directly related to writable .text.

Putting it into a "ro section" when it isn't actually read only is completely 
useless and does not do anything useful. So unless you figure out
a way to make a true ro section without performance penalty I wouldn't bother. 
If you really want it for cosmetic reasons you can still do it,
but it is about at the same usefullness level as shuffling white space in 
the source around.
