Both the master and the slave may have requests in progress at once now?  
This is the first time I have heard that issue refuted.  In fact, we just 
bought an 8-drive 3ware 7800, with 8 channels and 8 cables, that seemed to 
further confirm that issue.

So each drive was a master on a chain to itself?  I am not denying the 
performance of this setup.  Also was this on the above hardware (the read 
speed would exceed a PCI 33/32 bus)

4 drives on two chains (master & slave on each) is certainly more 
interesting.  The write speed is impressive, but what cut the read 
performance in half?

Indeed.  That 720GB file server totaled ~$3000.
