Or errors in the notifier's caller.

But you have to consider hypothetical kernel bugs.  That's exactly what 
lockdep is for -- to warn you about possible deadlocks that could be 
caused by bugs.
As a simple example, if thread #1 does "lock(A); lock(B)" and thread 
#2 does "lock(B); lock(A)" then there's a possible bug.  Lockdep should 
warn about you, and it does -- even if those two threads can never run 
at the same time.
If lockdep warned about deadlocks only when they actually happened, it 
wouldn't be nearly so useful.
