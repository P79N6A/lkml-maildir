Andrea, thank you, the patch fixed the problems I was having. I have a
cable modem connection to the internet. Without the patch ftp would
stall
(to any server), pings response would go to 12 Seconds (12000 mS), and I
would have some problems using sitecopy to a local server (on my
internal
LAN).
With the patch, ftp's no longer stall and ping response is back to 83 ms
for router (next hop) and ~300 ms for servers outside my ISP.
