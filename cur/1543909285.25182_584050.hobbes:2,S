IOW: Either the Linux binutils >= 2.17.50.0.3 or the not yet released 
GNU binutils 2.18 are now required.
Debian 4.0 has older ones, and all distributions released more than a 
year ago for sure also have older ones (the required patch went into 
binutils CVS on 2006-05-30 and 2.17.50.0.3 was released on 2006-07-15).
Isn't that a bit too recent?
