  Hi, all. Version 149 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This is against 2.3.33. Highlights of this release:
- Ensure include/linux/joystick.h is OK for user-space
- Improved debugging in <get_vfs_inode>
- Ensure dentries created by devfsd will be cleaned up
				Regards,
					Richard....
