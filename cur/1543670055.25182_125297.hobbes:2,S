This is in regard to the kernel message compression I'm working on.
I'm starting work on the code parser for the kernel, and I find that a 
lot of the printk format strings have macros in them.  Is there a quick 
and easy way to get preprocessor (.i) output from all kernel source files?
I'm sure I won't understand enough to hack all Makefiles, but in case I 
have to, what would be the best way of going about it?  I know about 
using -E, but I don't want to take an excessive amount of time on this.
Of course, to actually implement the text compression, all Makefiles 
will have to change anyhow to pipe preprocessor output through a program 
whose output is then run through the compiler.
