If someone is willing to step up to the plate and get the driver working again, it 
would be better to have the contact information for the old maintainer available 
in a centralized location.  Plus, anyone who tries the driver and finds it busted 
can look in the MAINTAINERS file and find out that it's not being fixed, instead 
of it being one of those drivers that has no defined maintainer (I've run across a 
few).
After all, we do have to be honest about unmaintained drivers - rather than hiding 
broken code.  Honestly, it's better to define who's responsible for an area of 
code, even if it no longer works.
My $0.02.
