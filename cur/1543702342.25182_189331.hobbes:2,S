Hi,
when I tried to activate ACPI on my computer, I received the mssage, 
that my BIOS is too old, and ACPI is automatically disabled.
I have a GigaByte 5AA mobo, which is a combined AT/ATX mobo (it has an 
ATX power socket, however it is in AT size).
Afterwards I tried acpi=force, which was proposed in the avove message.
The effect was:

PCI: if you experience problems, try using option 'pci=noacpi' or even 
'acpi=off'
which looks rather promising.
However, later, when my SCSI contoller probed its devices, the following 
message was printed:
Losing too many ticks!
TSC cannot be used as a timesource. (Are you running with SpeedStep?)
Falling back to a sane timesource.
Since then, some operations take _much_ longer.
So should I forget ACPI ?
