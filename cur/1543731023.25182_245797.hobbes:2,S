I would say that the directory under a file is implicit. There are still
the pseudo-files a filesystem might want to provide or the VFS if there
should be an agreement to generally provide file/pseudo/uid or possibly
some security hooks. Some filesystem might want to provide those pseudo
files but doesn't have the technical possibility to store non-pseudeo
files from the user under such a directory.
