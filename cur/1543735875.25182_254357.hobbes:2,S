Thanks for clarifying all this. I'm not going to tell anyone their
business model is evil (well unless it includes things like shooting
Colombian trade unionists to keep drink prices down). 
What you do with code you created, and which isn't derivative of other
code is -your business-. A lot of free software people do ask that it is
made clear which bits are free and which are not. I've never looked at
your development code to know how you handle this.
