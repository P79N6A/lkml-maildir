Personally, I much rather go the way we have gone, because I don't care
about module versioning nearly as much as I care about bug-report
versioning. And if I hear about a bug with 2.6.10-rc1, I want to know that
it really is at _least_ 2.6.10-rc1, if you see what I mean..
Now, personally, I'd actually like to know the exact top-of-tree
changeset, so I've considered having something that saves that one away,
but then we'd need to do something about non-BK users (make the nightly 
snapshots squirrell it away somewhere too). That would solve both the 
module versioning _and_ the bug-report issue.
So if somebody comes up with a build script that generates that kind of 
extra-version automatically, I'm more receptive. But I don't want to muck 
with the version manually in a way that I think is the wrong way around..
