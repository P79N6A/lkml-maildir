I anticipate the day removing __init causes a breakage, heh.
I mean, if all in-tree modules and LDD3 use it, it can't be wrong, can it?

I noticed that. Where's your "void" gone? :-)
And usually, the init routine returns int, not int32_t,
even if it's the same in current development models.
(I don't think you run an ILP64-compiled kernel.)
#include <linux/autoconf.h> is also not advised.
