Ok, 'S' means it's sleeping.
Can you enable Magic SYSRQ, and ensure that you have a large kernel
log buffer (the LOG_BUF_SHIFT configuration symbol).  Ensure that
/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq is 1, and re-run your test such that you have
something else waiting (eg, the strace sh).  Then hit Alt-SysRQ-T.
You can then read the kernel messages with dmesg - you may need the
-s argument to capture the entire kernel buffer.
This will tell us where all processes are sleeping.
