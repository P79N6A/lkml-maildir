Tape drive has been cleaned, but I'll look into behavior with other
tapes.  Thanks for the tip!  One thing I miss about ide tapes
(compared to the old floppy tapes) is the apparent inability to
reformat them.

OK, great!  Thanks for pointing this out!  I think I may be having a
problem with blocking on this drive, so I'll dig a little into st.c
and see if it handles this case OK.
The third error I get is:
Feb 27 16:01:45 intech9 kernel: st0: Error: 28000000, cmd: 8 1 0 0 40 0 Len: 16
Feb 27 16:01:45 intech9 kernel: Info fld=0x40, FMK Current st09:00: sns = f0 80
Feb 27 16:01:45 intech9 kernel: ASC= 0 ASCQ= 1
Feb 27 16:01:45 intech9 kernel: Raw sense data:0xf0 0x00 0x80 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x40 0x0a 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x00 
Feb 27 16:01:45 intech9 kernel: st0: Sense: f0  0 80  0  0  0 40  a
Feb 27 16:01:45 intech9 kernel: st0: EOF detected (0 bytes read).
Restoring a tape typically then says 'gunzip: unexpected end of
file'.  My guess was that the last fractional block of 32k wasn't
flushed to the drive.  Of course, if I'm having media troubles
indicated by the first error above, then something else could be
happening, I suppose.  But does erroneous block flushing in the driver
sound like a possibility?
Take care,
