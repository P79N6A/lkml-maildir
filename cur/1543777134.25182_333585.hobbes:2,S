Uh, and then you pass something like resume=/dev/hda5@BLOCKID on
command line? Okay, that could work.
Does this look fair?
Q: Why can't we suspend to a swap file?
A: Because accessing swap file needs the filesystem mounted, and
filesystem might do something wrong (like replaying the journal)
during mount.
There are few ways to get that fixed:
1) Probably could be solved by modifying every filesystem to support
some kind of "really read-only!" option. Patches welcome.
2) suspend2 gets around that by storing absolute positions in on-disk
image, with resume parameter pointing directly to suspend header.
