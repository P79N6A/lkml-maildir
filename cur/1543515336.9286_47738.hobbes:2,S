Hi folks,
I finally found the change, which gives me 
swap_duplicate: unused page
errors and worse when swapping shm segments used by more than one
process. It was introduced with 2.3.11 and the use of the page_cache
in shm.
The error can be reproduced on a uniprocessor kernel >= 2.3.11. 2.3.10
is fine.
Any help is welcome.
