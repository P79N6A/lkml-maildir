Hello David,
In article <1060387128.11983.34.camel@imladris.demon.co.uk> you wrote:

Is this needing some special hardware support, or is it kind of forcing
apm/apci power downs? Can you publish that script? I would need that for
some stress testing of applications and the kernel.
I also wonder, what the best method is to test those hard crashes,
especially interesting is the case, where disks get power interruption at
write, to see if the filesystem and block layer recovers from things like
half written (format needing) blocks.
Greetings
Bernd
