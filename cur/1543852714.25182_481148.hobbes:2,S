Windows uses it extensively especially games. The AMD desync upset a lot
of Windows gamers.

This will never happen for the really big boxes, light is just too
slow... Our current TSC handling is not perfect but the TSC is often
quite usable.
If hrtimer needs and requires we stop TSC support then we should delay
the merge of HRTIMERS until these new processors are out and common ;)
