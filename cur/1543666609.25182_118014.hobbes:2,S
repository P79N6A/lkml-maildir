Hi!
The following patch fixes a race on the rpc code, it is the
same race that was reported some weeks ago:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104462124226133&w=2
After some minutes doing transfer of multiple files in parallel, it Oopses
at xprt_timer because task->tk_client is NULL. It can happens because
rpc_del_timer don't call timer_del_sync if the timer is running. But
if xprt_timer is running, it can can setup itself to run again, even if
the task is already being released by rpc_release_task.
