Hi Jörn,
OK, I can do that. Would the "simple" fix go to the
trivial@kernel.org Trivial Patch Monkey?

Well, yes that raised a concern to me, the "exit" function
returns "void". If the del_mtd_device fails with EBUSY at the
moment (such as when a /dev/mtdblock<x> is mounted), we ignore
it and go on with freeing everything leaving a dangling mtd.
Is there a way around that?
Another problem is that it's not easy to check whether a mtd
creation was successful or not. Basically, you have to write to
a /sys file and then parse /proc/mtd to get the result.
What about having a /dev/block2mtd (with owner/permissions that
could allow non-root users to use it), with 2 ioctls:
- one to "link" a block dev to a mtd that would take as
  parameter a fd to an open block dev (again allowing for
  flexible permissions) and would return the number of the
  allocated mtd and success/failure in errno. Upon sucess it
  would increase the refcnt of block2mtd.
- and one to "release" the link. That would fail if the mtd is
  in use and decrease block2mtd's refcnt upon success.
A bit like the loop devices (or /dev/ptmx) actually. What do you
think?
(also, with the /sys interface, isn't there a potential problem
with chroots wrt the path given to the /sys file?)

I'll dig a little deeper, but I think I'll need some advice/help
at some point, I'm not a Linux kernel expert.
