Sorry, I was a bit hasty.
Hackbench is a test from Rusty Russel that's intended to test the scalability
of the scheduler.  The results I gathered are from a test where 100 processes
are started to send a message to another set of 100 processes.  This is
repeated at least a few times and the time taken to complete each instance
is averaged.  Anyone feel free to correct me as I learned this second hand.
The general trend in the metric indicates everything has been improving, so I
think we rock.
