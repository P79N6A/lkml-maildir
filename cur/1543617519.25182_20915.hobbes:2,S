Totally other problem. When my KDE won't launch tasks from the bar, it
will still work just fine otherwise, shutdown cleanly, etc. System is not
in any way hung, just that clicking the browser or terminal button doesn't
start a process, and if I bring up a menu from the bar, and try to start
something like moon phase, it also doesn't start.
I think the kernel told KDE something it didn't want to hear, so to speak.
