And the winner is:
gregkh-driver-driver-core-make-uevent-environment-available-in-uevent-file.patch
Reverting only that from 2.6.21-rc7-mm2 gives me a working kernel
again.
I'll try building 2.6.21-git3 minus that one next, but I'll have
to revert it manually, because my naive attempt to "patch -R" it
failed 1 out of 2 hunks.
