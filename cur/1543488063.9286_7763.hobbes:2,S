ELF - not, all ELF binaries run correctly.
BUT, all a.out binaries does not run from NFS mounted directory:
[baggins@yellow03 baggins]$ file /usr/local/bin/eml 
/usr/local/bin/eml: Linux/i386 demand-paged executable (ZMAGIC), stripped
[baggins@yellow03 baggins]$ eml
bash: /usr/local/bin/eml: cannot execute binary file
[baggins@yellow03 baggins]$ 
[baggins@yellow03 baggins]$ mount
148.81.15.14:/usr/local on /usr/local type nfs \
			(ro,nosuid,nodev,nolock,addr=148.81.15.14)
Server is unfs on 2.2.1 (the same happens with knfsd),
clients 2.1.131-ac13 and 2.2.0-pre4/5
