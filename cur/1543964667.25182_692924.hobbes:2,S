Subject: [PATCH 0/2] ftrace ported to PPC

The following two patches ports ftrace to PowerPC. I tested this on
both my PPC64 box as well as my 32bit PowerBook G4.
This applies to the latest sched-devel (with some extra hacks to get that
to boot on PPC).
This also depends on the CFLAGS_REMOVE_foo.o patches I sent earlier.
