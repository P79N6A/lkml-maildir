Why bother, since there are 120 MB floppy drives (LS-120) on the
market?  The hard part isn't the drive, but the media, which needs to
handle the densities, and 120 MB media are readily available.
Unfortunately, the incompatible zipdrive has been quite successful in
marginalizing the LS-120; this is unfortunate since it has succeeded
in extending the life of the 1.44 MB floppy rather than establishing a
new standard.
