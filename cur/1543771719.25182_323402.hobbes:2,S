Hello,
does someone have some experiences with this card? I'm using 8.16 or 8.18 driver
(I do not want 6.x driver as it does not support suspend/resume).
Basically it works but on UDP I get about 50 % packet loss when I try to receive
1Gbps. It's reported as frame and overruns.
Does someone have similar observation?
