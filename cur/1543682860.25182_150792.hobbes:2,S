Make your driver a line discipline is the normal approach in this case
(ok to be fair putting it all in user space is the normal case). Take a
look at slip.c to see how slip sits above terminal interfaces.
The user space only approach is to use pty/tty pairs as things like
xterm do. This gives you a "terminal/serial" device the other end of
which is your user space program which can do the conversions it wants
then talk to a real serial port
