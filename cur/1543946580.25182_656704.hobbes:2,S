I'm afraid the two things aren't related, although faster access to
per-cpu is of course a benefit for this as well. My expressed concern
was the:
        spin_lock(&bc->lock);
        was_empty = list_empty(&bc->list);
        list_add_tail(&req->donelist, &bc->list);
        spin_unlock(&bc->lock);
where 'bc' may be per-cpu data of another CPU
