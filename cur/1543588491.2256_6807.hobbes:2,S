you're right, by using...
int loop_register_transfer(struct loop_func_table *funcs);
int loop_unregister_transfer(int number);
...one can register new transfer functions, but they rely on 'magic
numbers' for identifying the given crypto cipher, some of which are
defined in linux/loop.h; with the highest magic number being MAX_LO_CRYPT
(so patching is required nevertheless, if you want to have more than 20
ciphers by that scheme...)
#define LO_CRYPT_NONE     0
#define LO_CRYPT_XOR      1
#define LO_CRYPT_DES      2
#define LO_CRYPT_FISH2    3    /* Brand new Twofish encryption */
#define LO_CRYPT_BLOW     4
#define LO_CRYPT_CAST128  5
#define LO_CRYPT_IDEA     6
#define LO_CRYPT_DUMMY    9
#define LO_CRYPT_SKIPJACK 10
#define MAX_LO_CRYPT    20
well.... the only thing I don't really like about this is, that its a
static allocation of cipher id's, instead of a dynamic lookup by name
and I'm not sure how well module autoloading works by this scheme...
(the international crypto api offers string lookup for ciphers, and
registers itself as one of those numeric cipher ids as far as loop
device usage is concerned)
btw, there's still an issue with with the IV value being calculated on
varying blocksizes, which I pointed out some time ago (instead of being
calculated on 512 byte sectors, which I assume to be the smallest possible
blocksize settable on a device)
