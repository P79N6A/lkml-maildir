	Fellow list members:
I came acros this error, while compiling imm.c as a module.
->->
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 
-fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fno-strength-reduce 
 -DCPU=486 -march=i486 -DMODULE -DMODVERSIONS -include 
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/modversions.h   -c -o imm.o imm.c
imm.c: In function `imm_detect':
imm.c:169: `PARPORT_MODE_PCPS2' undeclared (first use in this function)
imm.c:169: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
imm.c:169: for each function it appears in.)
imm.c:172: `PARPORT_MODE_PCECPPS2' undeclared (first use in this 
function)
imm.c:176: `PARPORT_MODE_PCECPEPP' undeclared (first use in this 
function)
make[2]: *** [imm.o] Error 1
-<-<
I checked include/linux/parport.h and these values aren't there. I also 
ran grep on the whole tree it they only get refered at imm.c. Can 
anyone tell me what should they be to set them and finish compilation?
Thank you very much.
