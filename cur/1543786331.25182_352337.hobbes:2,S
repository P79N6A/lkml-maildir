It's more important to keep related definition together and organize them 
logically, than spreading definitions over zillion header files for the 
only purpose to be usable from asm.
If you want to cleanup sched.h and properly break it up, please go ahead, 
but I'm afraid that will be a lot more work than adding a few defines to 
asm-offsets.c.
bye, Roman
