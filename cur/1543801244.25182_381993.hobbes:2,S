Unfortunatly this is not option for my setup, since I use same kernel on
multiple systems (kind of livecd but with usb disk). One of them is SMP
one. I'm currently doing audio only on one of machines and it is
uniprocessor one. I prefer to avoid triggerring this bug instead of
having multiple kernels.
