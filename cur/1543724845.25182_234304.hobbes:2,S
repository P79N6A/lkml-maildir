Well, the kref has the same get/put race if used in a lock-free
look-up. When you do a kref_get() it is assumed that another
cpu will not see a 1-to-0 transition of the reference count.
If that indeed happens, ->release() will get invoked more
than once for that object which is bad. Kiran's patch actually
solves this fundamental lock-free ref-counting problem.
The other issue is that there are many refcounted data structures
like dentry, dst_entry, file etc. that do not use kref. If everybody
were to use kref, we could possibly apply Kiran's lock-free extensions
to kref itself and be done with it. Until then, we need the lock-free
refcounting support from non-kref refcounting objects.
Thanks
