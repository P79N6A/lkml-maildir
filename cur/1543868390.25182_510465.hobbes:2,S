I entirely agree that all the char business in C is messy enough to
justify separate warning switch(es) in GCC.
However, I still insist that the problem with the code:
   void foo(char *c);
   unsigned char *u;
   signed char *s;
   ...
   foo(u);
   foo(s);
is not (only) in signedness, as neither 'u' nor 's' has compatible type
with the "char*", no matter what is the sign of "char", so if one cares
about type safety he needs warnings on both invocations of foo().
