Sure.  But that one hasn't generated a single bug report (and never
will), because it's so insanely difficult to produce, even if one
explicitly wants to do that.  It will just never happen accidentally.
And even if it happens, there's absolutely no side affects on the rest
of the system.  You managed to make a process not react to SIGKILL,
well hurray.  You can do that more easily with ptrace().
