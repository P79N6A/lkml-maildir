I can't speak for anyone except myself, and I'm not in any way a big time 
kernel person, but personally I would prefer that what little code I've 
contributed stays GPL. It was GPL code I contributed to, I expect it to 
stay that way.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I'd say you need more than just the core people. Even 
the core people don't own the copyright to contributions made by 
small-time contributers like myself. You could argue that very small 
contributions don't qualify for copyright protection and you'd probably be 
right, but where do you draw that line?

There are other rewards than money.
