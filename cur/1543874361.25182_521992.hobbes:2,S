Well that's a bit sad.
Could you please set up netconsole
(Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt) and add initcall_debug to the
kernel boot command line and then send us the full bootup logs?
(Even better: serial console with earlyprintk).
If that doesn't shed any light, we might have to ask you to perform a
git-bisect search to find the buggy commit, I'm afraid.
