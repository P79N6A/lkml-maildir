Removing pcibios_present() makes a lot of sense, I have considered it 
deprecated for quite a while now.
Further (more a note to Greg), often the pci[bios]_present() call can be 
removed completely:  when it is followed by a pci_find_xxx or 
pci_register_driver() probe, which will obviously not find anything if 
PCI bus is absent, the pci_present() call can be removed completely.
I would love to deprecate pcibios_{read,write}_foo but I don't think we 
can remove them yet.  Likewise for pcibios_find_xxx... I haven't look at 
all the examples, but I would be worried about breaking ancient (but 
working) code.
That said, if you wanna do the cleanup, I wouldn't object to removing 
pcibios_find_xxx...
