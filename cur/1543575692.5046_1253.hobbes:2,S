Indeed!
On my dual Celeron workstation, 2.4 looks to me as if it is scheduling
"more". Thus when I move a window, the window takes on all intervening
positions. Under 2.2, the window sometimes jerks 10 pixels or so, but
it acutally follows the mouse. Under 2.4, you can get hte window to
lag the mouse by a significant amount.
Thus to me, 2.4 FEELS much less interactive. When I move windows they
don't follow the mouse in real-time.
