it has multiple zone normal and only one zone dma. I'm not forgetting
that.

it's not more complex than the current way, it's just different and it's
not strict, but it's the best one for allocations that doesn't "prefer"
memory from a certain node, but OTOH we don't have an API to define
'waek' or 'strict' allocation bheaviour so the default would better be
the 'strict' one like in oldnuma. Infact in the future we may want to
have also a way to define a "very strict" allocation, that means it
won't fallback into the other nodes at all, even if there's plenty of
memory free on them.  An API needs to be built with some bitflag
specifying the "strength" of the numa affinity required. Your layout
provides the 'weakest' approch, that is perfectly fine for some kind of
non-numa-aware allocations, just like "very strict" will be necessary
for the relocation bindings (if we cannot relocate in the right node
there's no point to relocate in another node, let's ingore complex
topologies for now :).
