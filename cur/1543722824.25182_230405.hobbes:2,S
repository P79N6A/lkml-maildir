Not that it matters here, but for correctness let me note that the
ia64 column is correct only for machines which don't have an I/O MMU.
With I/O MMU, ZONE_DMA will have the same coverage as ZONE_NORMAL with
a recent enough kernel (older kernels had a bug which limited ZONE_DMA
to < 4GB, but that was unintentional).
