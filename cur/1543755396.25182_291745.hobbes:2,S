I actually have one (or two) of these, but I agree that in this case it 
makes no difference. As a general thing I think DEPRECIATED would be 
useful for the case where there is a newer functional driver. The 
systems I have are unlikely to ever run a current kernel, so I am not 
affected, and I suspect most others who have this old stuff are running 
2.0 or 2.2 kernels, also.
