I've just released Linux 2.6.20.20.
It includes a fix for CVE-2007-4573 which affects the x86_64 architecture
with a risk of local privilege escalation. All x86_64 users are encouraged
to upgrade. An old minor fix was also included to prevent users from cheating
on setrlimit(RLIMIT_CPU). This one was merged in 2.6.22-rc1.
Note to the 2.6.20.y users:
  The patch rate on 2.6.22.y has significantly dropped, so it is about
  time to give it a try. Those who have not tested it yet are strongly
  encouraged to prepare for a migration, as there will not be many more
  2.6.20.y releases.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.20.19 and 2.6.20.20.
The patch and changelog will appear soon at the following locations:
