This is probably a big issue.  I believe interrupt context in hrtimers
uses per_cpu variables.

That's also something that I'm trying to solve.  To use the least amount
of memory and still have the performance.
Now, I've also thought about allocating per_cpu and when a module is
loaded, reallocate more memory and copy it again.  Use something like
the kstopmachine to sync the system so that the CPUS don't update any
per_cpu variables while this is happening, so that things can't get out
of sync.
This shouldn't be too much of an issue, since this would only be done
when a module is being loaded, and that is a user event that doesn't
happen often.
We would still need to use the method of keeping track of what is
allocated and freed, so that when a module is unloaded, we can still
free the area in the per_cpu data. And reallocate that area if a module
is added that uses less or the same amount of memory as what was freed.
