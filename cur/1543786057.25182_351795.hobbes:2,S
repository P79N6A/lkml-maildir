->oops, wrong node.
Still, this should all be pinned to one CPU, by happenstance.

Not sure what you mean here.

That's a special case and the callers should be changed to use a new
raw_numa_node_id() in that case.
Code which calls numa_node_id() and then continues to use the result of
that in preemptible code is often buggy.  Code which reevaluates
numa_node_id() in preemptible code and assumes that it returned the same
thing is even buggier (unless it happens to be CPU pinned).
numa_node_id() is doing a bad thing and should be converted to use
smp_processor_id() so we can identify all the possibly-buggy callsites.
