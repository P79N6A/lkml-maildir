For hisax not true, or I missunderstand it.
In HiSax, the schedule_timeout are use allways on init stage (during insmod)
for 3 purposes:
1.) To do delay (value is not important) for asserting reset on isdn chips.
2.) To wait for an IRQ to test the IRQ path (I send a command to the isdn
    chip which 'll cause an IRQ, then I wait with schedule_timeout().
3.) Timer test, some cards have a onboard timer which e.g 8ms, so I enable
    this timer IRQ and wait with schedule_timeout(), after that I test how
    many time the interrupt function was called.
Is this a right use of 
               current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
               schedule_timeout(delay);
, what is a better way to do point 2 or 3, 1. can be also a simple delay loop.
