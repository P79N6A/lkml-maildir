Subject: [PATCH] w6692.c/h not to hang up after IRQ LOOP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have had constant problems with Telewell's ISDN card hanging the
connection and telling about "IRQ LOOP". The only fix for that was
reloading of the hisax-module. Some surfing showed that this seems to be
quite common, but not with W6692-based cards from other manufacturers.
So, this patch does some resetting for card after the Irq loop. For me it
works, but I don't know if this causes some new problems for non-Telewell
cards or for other combinations of hardware or on whatever other cases.

My first posting, sorry if the patch-format is malformatted in some way
or if it causes your harddrive to crash and your dog to bite you. I
already found out that I can't post from an e-mail account which is not
subscribed, pissed of so I might bite your dog also.. blah
