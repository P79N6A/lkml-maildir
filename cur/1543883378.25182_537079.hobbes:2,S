It could some overheating problem but i think if it is, this is the first time 
it occurs :), and i don't have any array, SAMSUNG HM120JC IDE disk works on 
SONY VAIO FS-215B.
I just boot with plain CFSv7 and boot time seems normal; 
Apr 29 15:02:54 (up 10.72) /sbin/mudur.py sysinit
Apr 29 15:03:02 (up 17.26) /sbin/mudur.py boot
Apr 29 15:03:06 (up 21.34) /sbin/mudur.py default
I'll report if i can find any reproducable problem, so far CFSv7 works as 
expected :)
Cheers
