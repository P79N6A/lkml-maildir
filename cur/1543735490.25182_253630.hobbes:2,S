Good point. I forgot to mention that it is indeed sold as a RAID
system (and it seems to work under XP Pro) and that I have selected
"Ignore BIOS port disabled setting on FastTrak" and "Use PCI DMA by
default when available".
(I also tried to switch PCI-slot for my networking card, but the
effect was that the PDC now shares interrupts with more on-board
USB devices instead of the network card.)
