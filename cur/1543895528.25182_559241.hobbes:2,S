Thank you, this is the first time someone voices a coherent argument
that doesn't completely dismiss the potential benefits of prohibiting
tivoization, and doesn't focus only on the potential downsides of such
measures.  Even though you come to a different conclusion than I did,
I thank you very much for not pretending the point does not exist at
all, or phrasing arguments that don't counter the point in any way.

This is also true of computer users in general.  So what is it that
makes this case different?
Why should we ask vendors to pass on the corresponding sources to
users, if most users don't care?
Why should we ask vendors to not use patents to stop a user from
modifying and sharing the software they distribute, if most users
don't care?
What is it that makes the reasoning different for the particular case
of vendors using technical tricks to stop a user from enjoying the
benefits of modifications she could make herself, which could then
very well benefit the entire community and even the vendor?

Maybe I'm wrong, but I hadn't seen arguments that even pointed in this
direction, so the complete dismissal of the upsides came off as
selective attention.
Let's see how this proceeds.

Yes, your reasoning makes sense to me.  I can't speak for the FSF's
intentions, but I have no reason to disbelieve it's moved by ethics,
rather than by some plot to hurt TiVo.
