Ehh, I don't think so.  Here is the whole patched function:
static void con_flush_chars(struct tty_struct *tty)
{
	struct vt_struct *vt = (struct vt_struct *)tty->driver_data;
	if (in_interrupt())	/* from flush_to_ldisc */
		return;
	pm_access(pm_con);
	acquire_console_sem();
	if (vt)
		set_cursor(vt->vc_num);
	release_console_sem();
}
When we check vt, it isn't stale.  vt is a _pointer_ to the data so that
first reference against it is guaranteed to grab the correct value.  The
only possible race is between the if and the set_cursor, but that isn't
an issue because we acquired the console semaphore.  There is no race
here.

Thus, unless I am mistaken, it is fine.  Please, apply.
