The following is a series of patches related to Unionfs.  The main change
here is that unionfs now has its own ->writepages method.
These patches were tested (where appropriate) on Linus's 2.6.24 latest code
(as of v2.6.23-6623-g55b70a0), as well as the backports to
2.6.{23,22,21,20,19,18,9} on ext2/3/4, xfs, reiserfs, nfs2/3/4, jffs2,
ramfs, tmpfs, cramfs, and squashfs (where available).  See
http://unionfs.filesystems.org/
 to download backported unionfs code.
