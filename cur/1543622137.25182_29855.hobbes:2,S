I did some digging on the chipset used by the dlink card, and its made by the 
folks at 
http://www.itexinc.com/
 .  They claim Linux support, but only in the 
form of an infrequently updated binary only module that is only available 
through OEMs.  Unfortunately, they're uncooperative in providing documentation 
for writing an open source driver.  It would be Really Nice if the guidelines 
on the use of the Linux trademark prevented claims of Linux support without 
driver source (ie, forcing binary only module drivers to be marketed as 
"partial Linux support through kernel specific binary modules").
