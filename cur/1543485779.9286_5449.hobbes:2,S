Note that the kernel already maintains an epoch in the rtc code
(see linux/drivers/char/rtc.c). There similar heuristics are used
to determines the epoch. Moreover, there are ioctl's to set the
epoch from userspace.
linux/drivers/char/rtc.c now knows about 1900, 1952 and 1980.
The unpatched linux/arch/alpha/kernel/time.c now seems to
reckon with 1900 and 1958; the patch adds 1980.
Clearly linux/drivers/char/rtc.c and linux/arch/alpha/kernel/time.c
must use precisely the same epoch value. It should be defined
outside of #ifdef CONFIG_RTC.
Furthermore, note that this patch is a heuristic only,
and that it may fail. For example, when booting SRM via ARC
the epoch is probably 1900 and not 1980.
