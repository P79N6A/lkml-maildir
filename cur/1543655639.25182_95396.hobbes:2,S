Linux 2.5.51 appears to have horribly broken the files in
drivers/video/sis. linux-2.5.51/drivers/video/sis/sis_main.c
refers to #include <video/fbcon.h>, <video/fbcon-cfb8.h>,
<video/fbcon-cfb16.h>, <video/fbcon-cfb24.h>, <video/fbcon-cfb32.h>
which appears to have been removed from the tree. And who knows
what other havoc has been created :-(
Does anyone know how to fix this?
Thanks, Willem Riede.
