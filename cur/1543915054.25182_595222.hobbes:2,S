Since this morning, the machine is running with the dvb driver for that
certain card unloaded...
Anyway you convinced me that it is the bad saa7134_dvb drivers (driving
the asus p7131) fault. As the driver seems huge, I wonder whether there
are a) other config debug options that could aid in debugging b) what
the names of certain io functions are that may cause this...
Thanks a lot!
