If I'm understanding this correctly, this is what happens now.  There
is still the flag check and return if the queue is being run, but I
don't see the advantage of removing that.

You mean preventing the upper layers from calling fsync?

Yeah, this is something I've thought about on occassion but never
done.

I have that, but haven't merged it since I see no performance benefit
for some reason.

Right - I cooked up a scheme a while ago that had the requests on a
list, being removed from one end and added to the other, with some
minimal number of bytes going across the pipe to ensure a wakeup if
the other side was possibly asleep.  But I never implemented it.

Yup - for this, we either need to test the host for futuxes and use
pipes as a fallback or give up on 2.4 as the host.

Interesting idea.  That does avoid the formerly fatal mmap problem.
If you unmap it, the private copy goes away because it lost its last
reference, and if you map it again, you get the shared version.
That's a lot of mapping and unmapping though.  I wonder if just
calling mmap would cause the COWed page to be dropped...
