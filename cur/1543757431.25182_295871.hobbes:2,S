I really really think this is wrong. Power management should be
possible without input layer. EV_PWR is fine for telling input devices
to do something, like enter lower power mode and for sending _some_
requests to the PM system. But input layer shoudl not be used as a
generic transport. I mean battery low, docking requests, etc has
nothing to do with input.
