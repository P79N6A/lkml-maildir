I think I have a similar problem with a 3c905B. I'm using Debian/GNU
Linux (Potato) with the 2.2.18-pre kernel to do the install. DHCP
configuration from the installer does not work, but DHCP configuration
from the installed system (configuring the network manually, then
changing to DHCP afterward) works.
What I noticed, was during the install my DHCP server wasn't seeing the
broatcasts from the client.
Also, I notice that with the kernel driver, the NIC switches to 10baseT
half-duplex when the interface is brought up, yet the MII autonegotiates
with the other end to 100baseTX half-duplex. I haven't tried 3com's
driver yet. Oh.. and 3com's windows driver was doing the same thing (as
of about ten months ago) when I had the NIC in a windows machine last.
