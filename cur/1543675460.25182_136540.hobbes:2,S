Why are you recommending this when after 2 days of going back
and forth in emails with me you came to the conclusion that for
performance critical paths such as the hashes in the kernel the Jenkins
hash was an acceptable choice?
It is unacceptably costly to use a universal hash, it makes a multiply
operation for every byte of key input plus a modulo operation at the
end of the hash computation.  All of which can be extremely expensive
on some architectures.
I showed and backed this up for you with benchmarks comparing your
universal hashing code and Jenkins.
Some embedded folks will have your head on a platter if we end up using
a universal hash function for the DCACHE solely based upon your advice.
