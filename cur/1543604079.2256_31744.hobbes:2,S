dd and mkfs works with 2.4.3 but not with 2.4.11.x or 2.4.10.x
dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=1024k   or   mkfs /dev/sdb3 
both fail with "File size limit exceeded"
Booting the same system with 2.4.3 or 2.2.19 anything
works as expected.
So is the problem with the kernel (as I assume) or do I miss something ?
Can anyone else please verify this ? 
(One really needs two disks, dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null does not show
the problem)
