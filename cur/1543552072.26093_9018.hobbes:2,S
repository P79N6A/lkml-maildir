It was supposed to be ok to not have a default nls value set but still be
able to activate nls if you want to. Giving it the old no-nls behaviour
until you say otherwise. Missing support from smbmount is the main reason
for having the default.
One solution might be to change the smbfs config to look more like the
ncpfs config and force a 'n' value if CONFIG_INET isn't 'y'. Patch for
this below, but the second patch you sent looks fine too. You didn't say
which kernel version you are using ...
You could also try the cml2 config tool. The cml2 config language is much
better at handling unset values and the current version has no problems
with this (n is the same as undefined, as I understand it).

(if you test it, kernel-rules.cml may need a search&replace of INTEGRATOR
 with ARCH_INTEGRATOR)
