I'm at a loss as to what this is being caused by - I don't even use rpc or
anything like that. I need to solve this asap because if I start up my
udplogd (part of snplog-0.1.tar.gz) daemon it rapidly fills up my logs
with lots and lots of the same crap like the following

I do need to track down the cause because I don't like not running my
logging daemons.  Thanks for any clues. 
Cheers, 
Alex
