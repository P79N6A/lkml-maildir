I totally agree with you, Pavel. But while we are on this subject --
shouldn't the explicit check like this:
        /*
         * Use a reserved one if we're the superuser
         */
        if (files_stat.nr_free_files && !current->euid)
                goto used_one;
 
in fs/file_table.c:get_empty_filp() be switched to capabilities? I.e. is
the hardcoded euid=0 value intentional there or is it an omission?
Regards,
Tigran
