Barry, if the system boots up fine with LLC disabled (and if you still 
get the lockdep warning), then please apply the following patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/lockdep-patches/latency-tracing-lockdep.patch
accept all the default 'make oldconfig' options and reboot into the 
patched kernel. If everything goes well then the system should still 
boot up fine, you should still get the lockdep warning - but this time 
there should be a long trace in /proc/latency_trace. Please upload that 
trace - it gives us the kernel's function trace, leading up to the 
warning.
