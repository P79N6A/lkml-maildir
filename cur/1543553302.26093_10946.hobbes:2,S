Thanks for the hint, it works great indeed, I couldn't freeze the machine
any more - at least the make process understood Ctrl-C.
However, the OOM killer behaves in strange ways, it seems.  In the 2 "make
-j50" runs I had (one with the working fs mounted 'sync', the other
'async'), it mostly killed non-root processes, but once it killed 'cron',
which was run as root:
[sync run]
Nov  1 15:51:05 bylbo kernel: VM: killing process cpp
Nov  1 15:56:38 bylbo kernel: VM: killing process apache
Nov  1 16:02:54 bylbo kernel: VM: killing process cc1
Nov  1 16:08:51 bylbo kernel: VM: killing process wwwoffled
[async run]
Nov  1 17:13:08 bylbo kernel: VM: killing process apache
Nov  1 17:14:01 bylbo kernel: VM: killing process cron
apache was running as "www-data" (uid 33), wwwoffled as "proxy" (uid 13).
An idea that came upon me was whether it would be possible to add to the
OOMK some sort of preference for processes owned by "system users", to be
defined by a "uid limit".  For example, on Debian systems, where "real user"
uids start at 1000, it would be great if the OOMK would leave those
processes as far as possible off its kill list.  Opinions ?
Best regards,
