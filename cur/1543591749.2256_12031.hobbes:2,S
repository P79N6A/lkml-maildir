But why is the server going down when that message apheres in the log?... No 
one can telnet to the computer, ssh, web is not awailabe... And the message 
gets repeted all the time. The only thing to do is to reset the server.
Well I dont know what else to do.
netstat -tan doesnt show anything wrong.
