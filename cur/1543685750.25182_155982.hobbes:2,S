Hello.  I just tried to compile up 2.6.0-test3 for my x86 box, and I
noticed that the following set of options will no longer work:
CONFIG_EMBEDDED=n
CONFIG_SERIO=m
CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBOARD=y
CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=y
The problem is that unless I set CONFIG_EMBEDDED, INPUT_KEYBOARD and
KEYBOAD_ATKBD both get set to 'Y', regardless of the other dependancies
(such as SERIO being 'm').
