you said interrupt won't call that function so I don't see the
GFP_ATOMIC issue.
I also don't what's the issue with GFP_ATOMIC regardless somebody uses
it or not, the patch itself has nothing to do with GFP_ATOMIC. All
gfpmasks can fail, allock_skb can fail regardless of the gfpmask, not
only GFP_ATOMIC will fail, of course GFP_ATOMIC can fail even if the
machine is not totally out of memory but you never know and you cannot
assume anything and when alloc_skb fails you must assume the machine is
totally out of memory or you will deadlock, so if alloc_skb fails we
must return -ENOMEM and take the fail path and the patch does the right
thing in such case as well.
