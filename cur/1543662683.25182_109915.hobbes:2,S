Over here in "old europe", I can get 1" Rackspace with unlimited
traffic for as little as 50 euros per month. I can even get a managed
server with that for about 100 euros. I can't believe that this is not
possible in the country of "unlimited bandwith" (TM). Talk to the
people at RackShack or drop me a line, so we can arrange something
with a housing provider over here.
This is, after all, the 21st century.
