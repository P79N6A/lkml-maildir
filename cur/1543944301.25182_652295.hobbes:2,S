It depends whether it is a derived work. It doesn't matter if you paint
it green, hang from trees while writing it or recompile it backwards
while chanting - the legal boundary is the one from copyright law and
that is where you must look for precedent and answers whether from prior
computing cases or from equivalents in other areas.
