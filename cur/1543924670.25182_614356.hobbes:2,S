Perfectly possible, but not the likely case.

Well, yes, but we don't usually make that argument for allocating
more than we need - especially not when memory is low ;)

Ah yes.  And that's certainly no argument for retaining the code,
I'm sure it's not a case we need to optimize for.

Okay, I wanted to make the point, but I've no wish to hold up your fix
(and removing code, particularly code that has given trouble, is always
welcome).  Please go ahead - thanks.
