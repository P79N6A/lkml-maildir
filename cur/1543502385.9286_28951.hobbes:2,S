Huh. I'm wonder how you was able to miss all this, but anyway:

Subject: Re: pre-2.3.7-1 fails compile
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.95.990613195550.10845F-100000@penguin.transmeta.com>
I'd like to point out that the current pre-2.3.7 series is fairly
experimental. As amply demonstrated by the filename (the "dangerous" part
in the filename hopefully made some people go "Hmm..").
We're working on re-architecting (or rather, cleaning up so that it works
like it really was supposed to) the page cache writing, and as a result a
number of filesystems are probably going to be broken for a while unless
we get people jumping in to help.
Right now 2.3.7-1 (aka "dangerous") is not stable even with ext2, in that
swapping doesn't work. Ingo just sent me patches to fix that, and I'm
hoping to remove the "dangerous" part from 2.3.7-2, but even then a number
of filesystems will be broken.
We _may_ end up just re-introducing the "update_vm_cache()" code for
filesystems that really don't need the added performance, but it would
actually be preferable if people really wanted to make them perform well
with the new direct write-through cache code.

Subject: Linux-2.3.7.. Let's be careful out there..
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.9906201916560.657-100000@penguin.transmeta.com>
The new and much improved fully page-cache based filesystem code is now
apparently stable, and works wonderfully well performancewise. We fixed
all known issues with the IO subsystem: it scales well in SMP, and it
avoids unnecessary copies and unnecessary temporary buffers for write-out.
The shared mapping code in particular is much cleaner and also a _lot_
faster.
In short, it's perfect. And we want as many people as possible out there
testing out the new cool code, and bask in the success stories..
HOWEVER. _Just_ in case something goes wrong [ extremely unlikely of
course. Sure. Sue me ], we want to indeminfy ourselves. There just might
be a bug hiding there somewhere, and it might eat your filesystem while
laughing in glee over you being naive and testing new code. So you have
been warned.
In particular, there's some indication that it might have problems on
sparc still (and/or other architectures), possibly due to the ext2fs byte
order cleanups that have also been done in order to reach the
afore-mentioned state of perfection.
I'd be especially interested in people running databases on top of Linux:
Solid server in particular is very fsync-happy, and that's one of the
operations that have been speeded up by orders of magnitude.

So do not expect working FAT any time soon... And do not expect some replace
for update_vm_cache as well: as Linus said it WILL be eventually implemented
for 2.4 if some filesystems will be still broked then but it'll not be done
for few weeks (or may be months)... Since most FS guru are not using FAT we,
mere mortals, are forced to live without FAT support for next few weeks when
using latest versions of 2.3.x :-/
