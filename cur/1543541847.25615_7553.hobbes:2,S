	i'm just wondering if 2.4.0-test6 will boot on Alpha architecture for
anyone else.  Perhaps i should be asking on linux-axp, but i thought i'd try
here first since i'm subscribed.  2.4.0-test1 would boot ok (using MILO), but
i was having problems getting PCMCIA to work (i have a Multia).  Mainly, for
the Noname machine (aka Multia), __raw_readw and __raw_writew aren't defined
(in 2.4.0-test1).  i tried Generic machine type, but then the kernel wouldn't 
compile.  i would have tried fixing the undefined __raw_readw and __raw_writew, 
but i thought i would try applying all the patches up to -test6 first to see 
if that helped.
	i am using aboot now.  i decided to switch to aboot because of the
limitations of the arc console (has to boot off of a bootable DOS partition).
i can boot other kernels with aboot, and i have the latest version (0.7a), so 
i don't think it's a problem with that.
