I think I have seen this once or twice in the past.  A reboot always
made it go away and it didn't seem to come back.  fsck never showed
anything so I assumed it was just the kernel having lost its mind about
the state of the FS.
I think I was using 2.4.18 or so at the time I last saw it.  It is quite
a while ago but it was ext3 as well as far as I recall.
I originally thought my df and company was messed up (since I think I
have seen a case on sparc where the libc/df were out of sync causing
weird output).
I never thought much about it since it didn't seem to be reproduceable
since it never repeated itself.
