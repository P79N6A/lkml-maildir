When a MMC card is pulled, we remove the MMC device structure (which
is what the driverfs_dev points at.)  At this point, the MMC layer
*totally* forgets about the MMC device and deletes it.
Unfortunately, an uncounted reference is kept while the partition is
mounted by the gendisk layer, which when the partition is unmounted
via hotplug causes another hotplug event to be generated with respect
to this freed MMC device structure, and hence you get an oops.
Since the MMC layer has lost all knowledge of the device, the only
possible solution is as given in that patch.
