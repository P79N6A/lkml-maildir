Good overview!
I'm wondering how the support for the SIS 182 controller is doing, I 
noticed they have a GPL driver on their website for kernel 2.6.10, which 
is not a drop in replacement for sata_sis.c in 2.6.12.5, I haven't tried 
compiling it as an add-on module outside the tree, though...
Adding the 0x182 identifier to the 180 driver does compile (duh!), but I 
haven't tried it on hardware.
As a temporary measure, there was a patch posted to this list [1] a 
while ago, would it be a good idea to include this while full support is 
being worked on?
Cheers
Simon
