Not as bad as it initially sounds; on non-PAE i386, it's 4KB and would
hurt. On PAE i386, it's 32B and can be shoehorned, say, in thread_info.
Then the rest is just a per-cpu kernel pmd and properly handling vmalloc
faults (which are already handled properly for non-PAE vmallocspace).
There might be other reasons to do it, like reducing the virtualspace
overhead of the atomic kmap area, but it's not really time yet.

Well, presumably it'd have to be abstracted so the mechanism isn't
exposed to core code if ever done. The arch code insulation appears to
be there to keep one going, though not necessarily accessors. Probably
the only reason to seriously think about it is that the arithmetic
shows up as a disincentive on the register-starved FPOS's I'm stuck on.

2MB vmallocspace is doable; it'd need to be bigger or per-something
besides cpus to hurt.
