These are tasks that are running in the kernel on behalf of a new system call.

The problem appears to be not with the process that is
spinning/yielding, but rather the one process which gets stuck.  It is
charged almost all the system time.  I agree that it's not pretty
though...

There is noone to call up() when a process is actually stopped.
If you have any ideas as to what can be happening or a better way to
accomplish this (in the kernel), I'd appreciate hearing it.
