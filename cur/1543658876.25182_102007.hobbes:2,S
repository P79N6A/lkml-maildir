Subject: [2.4.21-pre3] BUG: IDE DMA doesn't work w/ x86 HighMem

Configure the 2.4.21-pre3 kernel with IDE and Highmem and when DMA is 
attempted you get a BUG from asm-i386/pci.h line 155 called from 
drives/ide/ide-dma.c line 282.  
 From the looks of it, the IDE driver has not been highmem enabled, but 
does get a high-mem device queue.  
This is easily reproduced on a dual proc P3 with 2 Gigs of ram.
