Unfortunately, you created a by by doing so.  Eg:
- you have 3 devices on kset.list.
- you successfully register 2 of them with a driver.
- you fail one.
- sysdev_driver_register returns failure.
- module is unloaded while other parts of the kernel have references into
  the driver.
- the kernel oopses.

IMO its better to printk something on failure.
