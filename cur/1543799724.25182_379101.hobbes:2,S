0x1000 with 8k stacks, so long as %esp in in the top page of the 2 page
stack. 0x0 otherwise. Which explains why the poisoning crashes the kernel
with 4k stacks. 
But there's another problem with Dick Johnson's approach, and that is that
he doesn't clear the poison when a kernel stack is freed. (I don't believe
the kernel does this automatically, though I could be mistaken). And that
means that the results can't be trusted: if you have a string of 20 Qs,
_something's_ overwritten the rest, but that something wasn't necessarily
using the memory as a stack at the time. More than that, with the Qs
spread over two pages it's quite possible for one page to be overwritten
and the other still free with it's 20 or so Qs.
HTH,
