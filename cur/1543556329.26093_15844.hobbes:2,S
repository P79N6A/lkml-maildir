And where do you get contending processes? 'Cause it takes at least two
to get that...
When you have that size of message queues your best bet is to split them into
many directories, though - all FFS derivatives do linear searches, so locking
or not, you are going to lose.

It has to do with the lack of write ordering. Which can be fixed, but not
if you do many updates in one operation. However, even without the ordering
repacking increases the window of corruption. Big way.
