This all sounds exactly like the way we're headed as well, so I'm 
definitely interested in anything I can do to help.  Was thinking that 
can start defining kobject_uevent power events and attributes (with 
enough detail that acpid could use it instead of /proc if the ACPI 
drivers were to convert to it).
Capturing the relationships between drivers is difficult.  If nobody's 
already looking into this then I'll take this up soon.

At dynamicpower.sf.net we do something similar for cpufreq-style scaling 
of platform clocks and voltages, setting up desired policy for various 
platform clocks/voltages according to changes in low-level system state 
(primarily scheduler state) from userspace and then letting the state 
machine run without interaction.  Similar policy objects for devices 
sounds intriguing, although the device-specific nature of event triggers 
probably makes this quite difficult.
Mac OS X support for some of these concepts is documented at 
developer.apple.com, looking for ideas to steal...  Thanks,
