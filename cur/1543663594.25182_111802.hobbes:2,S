Your reasoning is wrong. It can well be a HW failure, those can be
load related in various way (memory failure happening when memory
is actually used, thermal failure happening on CPU load, etc...)
If the exact same setup worked for a while with same/similar loads
and suddenly started to fail, there are great chances it's actually
HW failure (possibly RAM).
