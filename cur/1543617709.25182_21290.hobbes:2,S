Yes I sent them to Linus.

I second that. 2.5.3-pre1 + 2nd patch from Jens + daft compile fixes is 
running fine on my Athlon/VIA chipset both UDMA100 and PIO4 on my 60GXP 
drive! Brilliant work guys!
There is only one odd thing and that is that PIO transfers are slower in 
2.5.3-pre1 + 2nd patch from Jens + daft compile fixes compared to in 
2.5.2-pre11-vanilla.
PIO mode, hdparm -t /dev/hda:
         on 2.5.3-pre1 + 2nd Jens patch: 4.62MB/s
         on 2.5.2-pre11 vanilla:         7.36MB/s
DMA transfers are the same with both kernels, peaking at 38-39MB/s which is 
I believe the theoretical upper limit for the 60GXP so there was not much 
room for visible improvement (2.5.3-pre1 is slightly faster in that it gave 
in three tests 38.79MB/s while 2.5.2-pre11 gave in three tests 38.32MB/s, 
so if you believe those ACB is .4 MB/s faster).
I don't care that PIO has become slower, all modern devices are happy with 
UDMA, and so am I. (-: But I thought I should mention it.
Note that 2.5.3-pre1 now survives find . -type f -exec md5sum "{}" \; both 
in PIO and UDMA mode so it can really be considered stable on UP system.
Best regards,
Anton
