Nada, nothing appears even if I put a printk before we do any actual probing.

Don't know yet. II didn't yet walk agp_amdk7_init() and dump out the values 
yet.

It does appear to be PCI. Yes, I don't see any significant changes in the agp 
code (other than the one mentioned below)

I'm going to do some git bisect fun (best time to learn how to do it) and 
narrow this down later when I get back from work. We should find the cuprate 
later today.

I can certainly do a quick debug on that to confirm if it is or not hitting 
that code path later today.
Thanks Dave. I'll provide you more info once I narrow things down a bit.
