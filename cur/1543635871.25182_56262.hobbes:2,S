The .config is OK.

Unfortunately this doesn't list interrupts, which happened, but are no
longer claimed by any driver - and the i8042 driver frees the interrupt
when it detects no device.

So it detected both the KBD and AUX ports properly, but for some reason
it couldn't identify the attached keyboard.
Can you #define ATKBD_DEBUG in drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c? 
Then you'll see what happened in' dmesg'.

Most likely you have a somewhat unusual keyboard - it may be responding
too slow perhaps, so that the driver times out - or doesn't support some
of the commands the driver expects to use.
Or the mouse kills the keyboard. This also can happen - they share
common resources. This would need more debugging then.
So, what's the keyboard, what's the mouse, and what's the mainboard
exactly?
