There are two reasons for that:
1. kthread interface doesn't support passing CLONE_IO flag.
2. Each (virtual) device has own pool of threads, which serves it. 
Threads in each such pools should have a common IO context, but 
different pools should have different IO contexts. So, it would be 
necessary to implement two levels start of IO threads in each pool. At 
first, one thread would be started. Then it would call get_io_context() 
to gain io_context. Then it would create the remaining threads with 
CLONE_IO flag. Definitely, it's a lot more complicated than a simple 
call of alloc_io_context() and assignment of the returned context to 
each just created thread in a loop before they were ran.
Thanks,
