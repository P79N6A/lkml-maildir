Hi,
Thanks for review. My comments inline.

I confirmned these from the author - I just ported this code. I think
he can answer you better - CC'ed him  :-)

OK. Changed.

The author must be having some performance gain with this directive.
Though I didn't test performance changes with/without this directive.

OK.

I looked more carefully into such cases. Following type of code blocks
are repeated at several places:
---
                COPY4(op,ip);
                op += 4;
                ip += 4;
                if (--t > 0) {
                        if (t >= 4) {
                                do {
                                        COPY4(op,ip);
                                        op += 4; ip += 4; t -= 4;
                                } while (t >= 4);
                                if (t > 0)
                                        do
                                                *op++ = *ip++;
                                        while (--t > 0);
                        } else
                                do
                                        *op++ = *ip++;
                                while (--t > 0);
                }
---
Such entire blocks can be replaced by simple:
memcpy(op, ip, t + 4);
Since kernel has separate memcpy() implementation optimized for
specific archs, we shouldn't loose on perf while having simpler (and
shorter) code.
I will work on this and post again.

What is the problem with uint32_t? Anyhow, I think COPY4 will
disappear after those memcpy changes :)
Thanks for comments. I will post revised patch soon.
Cheers,
Nitin
