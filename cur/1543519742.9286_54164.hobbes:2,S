Actually, the way make works this is all neatly handled, the reason I
suggested that /boot/config.mk-VERSION be used is because it is already
the common point for kernel post-compile stuff, it has the symbol table,
the .config used, and the kernel itself. /usr/src/linux is just a common
place, it is not something that the kernel itself can take care of after
you do 'make zlilo' or whatever.
If you do happen to need to override this to use another kernel location
you do exactly the same thing you do for any other scheme,
make KERNEL=~/kernel/config.mk
And make will automatically override the default internally selected
variable.
