Thanks, that's great information.  However, there is one question you
didn't cover.  How about using a sub-cache-line piece of a kmalloc()'ed
buffer (eg the case I described of using one member from a struct as a
DMA buffer)?  As far as I can see there is no guarantee that this will
always work.  Do you agree that this should be treated as a bug and
fixed when it is found?  Or should we leave that usage unless it is
observed causing problems (since we almost always get lucky and don't
touch the rest of the cache line near the DMA)?
Thanks,
  Roland
