I agree for recent x86 processors, but older or smaller designs would suffer
from multiply and divide.

OK, I agree with your demo, you convinced me.

well, the only hash function I wrote myself only had to suit my needs, and
didn't have to be resistant to hash attacks. But I agree that the strongest
functions you'll find are those which have been publicly available for years
and still remain uncracked.
