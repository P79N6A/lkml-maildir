Hello there,
Could anyone give me some information on how SIGSEGV is handled when  
a signal handler is installed. I need information about fault address  
and access type (read/write). I used the siginfo_t defined in bits/ 
siginfo.h, but the information I got from the handler arguments are  
not correct. Can anyone point out the right structure for the  
arguments of the signal handler.
I am using a Ubuntu port on Ultra Sparc T1, by the way.
Linux version 2.6.15-21-sparc64-smp (buildd@artigas) (gcc version  
4.0.3 (Ubuntu 4.0.3-1ubuntu5)) #1 SMP Fri Apr 21 17:04:05 UTC 2006
Thanks:)
Zhiyi
