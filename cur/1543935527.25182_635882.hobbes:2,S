Hi Ingo,
Here's a series which goes some way to tidying up pgtable.h.  It is
not complete yet, but this lot compiles and works for me.
In many cases I've moved code around with no attempt at adjusting the
formatting to acceptible style.  That can be done in a later patch,
but it means that checkpatch is noisy with this lot.
Thanks,
	J
