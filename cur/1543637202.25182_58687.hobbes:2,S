[4] is Deschutes according to the docs I used for x86info.

What [5] is is dependant upon cache size & stepping.
stepping 0:
    0KB - Celeron (Covington)
    256KB - Mobile Pentium II (Dixon)
stepping 1-3 Pentium II (Deschutes)

Stepping 0/5 - Celeron-A
Stepping A - Mobile PII

L2 Cachesize == 128 == Celeron (Else P3)

6a0 is another P2 Deschutes aparently, but this seems
odd, and I should double check this sometime.

Could be a celeron too. Not sure of cache size.

Model 5 = (Foster)
Unsure of other codenames.
