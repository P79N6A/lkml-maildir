That is a good and valid point

nice my_old_compute_intensive_app
We agree that only CPU intensive apps will cause the problem right?
So if we keep the CPU boosting mechanism, but only boost non-niced
processes (makes good sense in my twisted mind at least), we provide the
interactiveness benefits for the general case, and provide an easy way
to run unmaintained (or "semi broken" or whatever we will call them)
applications.
We end up "forcing" the user to nice some (hopefully few) CPU intensive
applications that didn't need nicing before.   I can see that that will
be a problem.
But will it be a bigger problem than not having the interactiveness
boost at all?
Cheers,
