With such a change results should be better - not only because seek is
removed with sequential read, but also number of working threads
decreases with time - until queue is filled again.
So, syslet-rw has increased to 37mb/sec out of 39/sync and 38/libaio,
the latter two did not changed.
With iodepth of 10k, I get the same performance for
libaio and syslets - about 36mb/sec, it does not depend on iodepth_low
being set to 1 or default (full).
So syslets have small problems with small number of iodepth - its
performance is about 34mb/sec and then increases to 36 with iodepth
grow. While libaio decreases from 38 down to 36 mb/sec.
iodepth_low=1 helps syslets to have 37mb/sec with iodepth=32, with 3200
and 10k it does not play any role.
