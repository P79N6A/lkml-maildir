Usual PC floppy controllers are not very flexible, so you just need
some more-flexible controller to do the trick. A popular choice
for creating master disks is to get an Amiga with an 1.44 floppy
(any A4000 will do), make some scratched disks and then duplicate
them with some fine 1990-ish hardware disk copier.
