It's not good.
The warning in device_del() is vital.  It's what will tell people where
the problem is when a deadlock occurs during system resume because some
driver has mistakenly tried to unregister a device at the wrong time.  
It would have pointed immediately to the msr driver in the case of the
bug Andrew found, for instance.
If you can figure out a way to disable the warning in device_del() for 
just the one device being unregistered by 
device_pm_destroy_suspended(), I suppose that would be okay.
