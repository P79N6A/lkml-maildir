I am thinking sparsemem default and then get rid discontig, flatmem etc.
On many platforms this will work. Flatmem for embedded could just be a 
variation on sparse_virtual.

Note that these arguments on DISCONTIG are flame bait for many SGIers. 
We usually see this as an attack on DISCONTIG/VMEMMAP which is the 
existing best performing implementation for page_to_pfn and vice 
versa. Please lets stop the polarization. We want one consistent scheme 
to manage memory everywhere. I do not care what its called as long as it 
covers all the bases and is not a glaring performance regresssion (like 
SPARSEMEM so far).

Right. But for embedded the memorymap base cannot be constant because 
they may not be able to have a fixed address in memory. So memory map 
needs to become a variable.
