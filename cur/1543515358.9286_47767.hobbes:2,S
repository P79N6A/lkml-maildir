Sorry to bother you guy with what is probably a trivial question. The
documentation I have been able to find indicates that there is only some
added functionality between the Adaptec 2940UW and the 2940UW pro. However
some problems I have had with scsi drivers is prompting me to ask, if this
is really the case, or has Adaptec modified the card to the point that the
old drivers will not work with it.
thanks,
Keith
