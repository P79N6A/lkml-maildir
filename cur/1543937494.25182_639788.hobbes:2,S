But then, this will cause an attribute conflicit. Old one was specifying
WB in PAT (ioremap with noflags) and the new ioremap specifies UC.
As Linus mentioned, main problem is to figure out the correct attribute
for ioremap() which doesn't specify the actual attribute to be used.
One mechanism to fix the issue generically (somewhat atleast) is to use
MTRR's and figure out the default MTRR attribute for that physical address
and use it for ioremap().

In this scenario, ACPI is using ioremap() leaving some dangling references.
Venki is looking to fix this code. Getting the attribute for MTRR
for ioremap noflags, might solve some of these issues aswell. Will look into
this.
