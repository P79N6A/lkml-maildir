Now you're just being stubborn, Andrew ;-).
The extra check does not matter much at all for most cases. What it buys
us is consistent API with kfree(), more robust slab, and less bugs, no?
All the super-hot paths can be fixed with __kmem_cache_free(). As an
added bonus, we can remove all extra debugging checks when
CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG is disabled from __kmem_cache_free() as it will be
only used in tested, known good code paths so performance for those
cases will be even better!
So I'll whoop up a patch soonish and send it to you. Perhaps your evil
twin will apply it.
