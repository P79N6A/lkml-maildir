I noticed the same a few days ago, but only started looking into it a few
minutes ago.
If MAX_NUMNODES is larger than one, highest_possible_node_id() is no longer a
macro, but a real function, defined in lib/cpumask.c.
NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES depends on DISCONTIGMEM || NUMA.
But lib/cpumask.c is compiled only for SMP, causing a link failure if
CONFIG_SUNRPC is enabled, as net/sunrpc/svc.c:svc_pool_map_init_pernode() uses
highest_possible_node_id().
