Don't know much about coda, but...
Helge has basically said that the files *are* copied to your system
transparently (probably to a configurable location) and once you are
finished it will be synced with the coda server.
If you need *exclusive* access, just check out (change permissions to you as
owner, and chmod 0600), and back when you're done.  This is probably done
with root suid tools to be able to chown.
