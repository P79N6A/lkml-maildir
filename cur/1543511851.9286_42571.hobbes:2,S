Well, people may be saying it but I'm not one.  I said it would break
compatibility with "someone" and I personally think it's a non-issue.
Expanding my example above, both LILO and rdev rely on a kernel ABI
which specifies a 16-bit place to put a root device number.  This would
have to be modified, and LILO and rdev would by necessity break.  (At
least rdev breaks.  LILO can be tricked into using a command line for
root device by judicious use of "append=".  This from Richard's devfs
FAQ -- since the same issue comes up with "devfs=nocompat".)

Nothing wrong with it at all, except the small amount of necessary code
bloat.  This bloat is no doubt negligible but I mention it because
bloat is the only argument against devfs that I buy at this point.
Perhaps the bloat of 32-(or 64-)bit dev numbers can be considered the
Lesser Satan, as compared to devfs, the Greater Satan. (:
