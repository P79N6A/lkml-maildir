Custom print_mac worked very nice for me in acx driver.
In order to accomodate arbitrary text before/after mac addres,
I did it this way:
#define MACSTR "%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X"
#define MAC(bytevector) \
        ((unsigned char *)bytevector)[0], \
        ((unsigned char *)bytevector)[1], \
        ((unsigned char *)bytevector)[2], \
        ((unsigned char *)bytevector)[3], \
        ((unsigned char *)bytevector)[4], \
        ((unsigned char *)bytevector)[5]
void print_mac(const char *head, const unsigned char *mac, const char *tail)
{
        printk("%s"MACSTR"%s", head, MAC(mac), tail);
}
Usage: print_mac("adev->bssid: ", adev->bssid, "\n");
