Thank you for your suggestion, but I still have a question about it. 
If I do
clock_gettime (CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID, &old);
sleep(5);
clock_gettime (CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID, &new);
why the difference (new-old) includes also the time the process has slept ?
Maybe there was a misunderstanding: I am looking for a way to know how long a 
process has _actually_ executed, accounting for all periods that it has not 
executed for some reason (like sleep, blocking, preemptions, etc.). And I 
need the high precision gave by the TSC (jiffies is not enough).
getrusage works fine, but has a coarse-grain precision (jiffies).
clock_gettime, instead, has a very good precision (thanks to TSC) but as you 
can see, it does not return the time that the process has actually 
executed...
If I am wrong, please tell me where.
Thank you,
            Claudio
