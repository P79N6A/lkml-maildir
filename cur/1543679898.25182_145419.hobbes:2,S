OK.  The changes are OK in principle but your patch is a bit borken
since you add a check "if (sig == SIGSEGV)" in sys_sigreturn and
sys_rt_sigreturn, but there is no variable called "sig" in those
functions.
I have some other signal changes pending.  I'll roll in your changes
and push it on to Linus shortly.
Paul.
