Also, I think, that implementing everything in the kernel of some sort
requires much simpler file system and thus faster code and smaller memory
requirements than implementing complex servers in the user space.

You wouldn't need them if the server is in the kernel. At the very least,
there wouldn't be any need for wrapping the kernel calls with user-space
functions - again, conservation of space and time.

It's probably a much cleaner solution, yes, but not always faster and more
efficient both in terms of space and time. But the in-kernel implementation
is suitable mostly for the embedded systems, IMO.
