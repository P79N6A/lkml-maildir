I want to be able to changes these parameters at run time.  Eventually, 
if we might want these parameters as rdma connection setup parameters. 
For now, its useful to be able to set them without reloading.
Also, it is safe to change them at any time.  All of these are read once 
and utilized at connection setup.  So changing them is safe in that 
existing connections aren't affected, and only subsequent connections 
will utilize the new values.
Sorry for the terse changelog...
Steve.
