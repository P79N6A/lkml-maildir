There UNICODE doesn't matter for console.

This is just plain wrong (by a magnitude):
 			±¡êÊ³£ñÑ¼¬¿¯óÓ¶¦æÆ (ISO8859-2)
And by the way Polish has more similiarities with Ukrainian then english
obviously. Even more then with Russian :-). Razgawaritje po ruski?
(Ehm. I know there are hardly Ukrainians talking ukrajiñski jêzyk.)

Before Stalin told them different the Ukrainians used the same scripting

as in Poland.

For You ISP job?! BTW. the implementation I'm suggesting isn't going to
make Your work
any more difficult. It's the CLIENT side wich is of relevance.

Not easy. and it isn't currently this way...

Yes it's easier to mess around in the kernel, then to write proper user
level
applications, since you don't need to know what even consoles and
virtual terminals are 
really about. And you don't need to know all the other stuff about the
OS too.
(Please just prove me wrong by providing the corresponding apps.) But
this doesn't
imply that complicated stuff (I just don't  beleve it can be done in
10k.
Even the simplest proper unicode mapping will requie at least 64k.) 
shouldn't be done in user land. There You cand read files with different
glyphs.
You don't need to worry about size, compatibility, and more of nice
gooddies 
like this... ;-).
And please show me where are all those unicode aware console
applications you need
that badly to support? Unicode editor for example? I could actually use
one myself 
and I would be already just plain happy if the border drawing characters
worked
properly anywhere.
Please just do man screen(1).
