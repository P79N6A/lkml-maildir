This doesn't work, sorry.
I get:
EXT3-fs: Unrecognized mount option conv
EXT2-fs: Unrecognized mount option conv
found reiserfs format "3.5" with standard journal
[Usual boot messages]
on boot, which is odd.  I do have some EXT3 partitions too, but my root
is certainly reiserfs.
This probably isn't the right place to be asking for this kind of help I
guess, but if anyone can shed any light - I would appreciate it.
However I am in the process of creating some reiserfs boot disks so I
can convert it...
