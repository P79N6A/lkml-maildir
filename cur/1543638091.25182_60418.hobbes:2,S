Nope. On my system (2.5.29-changeset548) it is a BUG() call which was
added by akpm in rmap.c revision 1.5, in his 'Add BUG() on a can't-happen
code path in page_remove_rmap()'. It just added #else BUG() branch
to #ifdef DEBUG_RMAP conditional.
Kernel is SMP, non-preempt, running on UP P4. Compiler is 2.95.4 from
Debian sid.

Probably because of your code did not do anything special when
'Not found. This should NEVER happen!' code path triggers. Code in
bitkeeper since 27th July complains. I'm now running with DEBUG_RMAP
set, so I'll see next time.
