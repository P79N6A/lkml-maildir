After looking at what's in your stub now, and at the gdb source code,
I've filed a gdb bug (remote/1571) as the protocol docs and code don't
agree on what's expected from a detach.  The docs say that gdb doesn't
look for a reply (so we wouldn't/shouldn't make one) but the code does,
and will print out an error code, if one happens.  So I'm going to leave
this bit of code alone for now.
