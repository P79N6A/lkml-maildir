    Subject: Partition table problems
    After upgrading from kernel 2.0.32 to 2.1.131,
    I get the following error messages when I run fdisk:
    mail1:/home/aw# fdisk -l /dev/sda |head -20
    Disk /dev/sda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 528 cylinders
    Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes
       Device Boot    Start      End   Blocks   Id  System
    /dev/sda1   *         1        7    51184    6  DOS 16-bit >=32M
    Partition 1 has different physical/logical beginnings (non-Linux?):
         phys=(0, 1, 1) logical=(0, 0, 33)
    Partition 1 has different physical/logical endings:
         phys=(49, 63, 32) logical=(6, 95, 25)
    Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary:
         phys=(49, 63, 32) should be (49, 254, 63)
This means that 2.1.131 invented a geometry C/H/S=528/255/63
for your disk, while 2.0.32 invents C/H/S=414*/64/32
(with 4142-4149 cylinders).
Changing anything that is not broken here is always a bug.
My memory is bad and there have been a few recent changes.
Maybe things are correct again in 2.2.0.
If you try 2.2.0 and things have not improved then please give
the kernel boot messages for the disk and mention which
SCSI controller you are using.
[Inventing a geometry for a SCSI disk is the job of the driver;
maybe some driver was changed.]
[There is no reason to worry. This has no influence on Linux;
as long as you do not repartition your disk it has no influence
on DOS, if you have that; there can be LILO problems, and these
are probably avoided if you add a line `linear' in /etc/lilo.conf .]
