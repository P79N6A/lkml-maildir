Sorry to follow up to my own message, but further experiment has shown
that it is almost certainly a kernel change which has caused this -
though I do not know if the problem is in bash or the kernel changes.
I have now put 2.2.14 in /usr/linux (and configured but NOT built it)
and bash now builds perfectly. So with 2.2.14 headers it builds, but
with 2.3.35/6 it does not.
