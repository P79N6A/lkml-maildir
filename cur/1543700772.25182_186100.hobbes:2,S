Just curious, what kind of disk/OS config do you have where
using loadlin (or linld) is useful?  Does it have anything to do
with not writing (updating) the MBR on disk?
Are there some booting alternatives for you?
Is Linux on the same hard disk as Windows (or DOS)?

Yes, not much difference in those source files.

Good question.  I'm not sure.  Anyone else have suggestions?
