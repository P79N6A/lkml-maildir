IMHO only one bug has been shown.  The critical section of the context
switch is protected by a spin_lock and the task struct of the task being
switched to is saved.  The correct fix is to use that task struct when
setting need_resched, then need_resched cannot be lost.
Why disable interrupts when we dont have to?
