Yeah -- we build all this stuff dynamically.  struct file, struct inode,
etc.  You could store them on disk as they would be represented in
memory, but this would be incredibly inefficient because of all the
runtime structures unnecessary on disk, and because of all the fixups
and checks you would have to perform on the data in the images after
they magically appear in memory.
Reading a tarball is the distillation of what you describe into
efficient form :)
