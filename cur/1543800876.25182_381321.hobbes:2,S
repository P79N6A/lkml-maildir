Thanks - just saw the genetlink patches/interface which seems to handle 
the problem of
creating new netlink types as well.
But why do I get the feeling that the delay accounting patches are 
becoming a pawn in deprecating connector usage ? :-)
I'd rather not run off and implement over genetlink (which no one else 
seems to be using right now) unless there's some
consensus that connectors are to be deprecated.
Andrew - any opinions ?
