What is "DCO document"? 
DCO stands for Developer's Certificate of Origin in SumittingPatches?
If so, I will put original text of the DCO into the translated SubmittingPatches.
If not so, please tell me about DCO document.

Thanks, I couldn't notice possibility of false recognition of character code 
because there was no probelm in my environment.
But, I used mew as MUA and the patch was recognized as Ascii, not UTF-8.
I think alternative based on your suggestions.
Thanks
