Richard,
Caldera's first 2.3 build had some problems.  I picked up a later build,
and the modversions.h file was fixed.  This was a Caldera Linux
Distribution problem on their early 2.3 (I get early CD's from them
sometimes).  When I tried it with RedHat Linux, it worked fine. 
kmalloc() not being exported was kindof funny looking to me as well.  :)
Thanks for the help.
Your friend,
Jeff
