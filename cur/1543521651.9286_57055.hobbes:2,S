Until some kind soul submits an elegant fix, I will take even a completely
buggered fix for anything that makes it impossible to even run a 2.3.x kernel;
the one that affects me (and anybody else out there???) is the MD driver:
* "Got md request, not good..."
I can't even boot up /sbin/init.  :-(
If RAID 0.90 addresses this, fine; but if not, or that isn't going in for
awhile, then I would sure hope that the popular work-around floating about (or
some facsimile) will be applied in the interim.
