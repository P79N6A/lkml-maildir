What a crock.  If a Winmodem/linmodem whatever software modem did
not use up a lot of CPU resources, then it would not suck so bad.
If the two use the same amount of CPU, then the ones with DSP's
should remove the DSP, and run just fine without the host CPU
doing any more work.
Software modems are a hardware ripoff in any situation no matter
how anyone explains it to me.  I see them as a total ripoff FOR
EVERYONE.
