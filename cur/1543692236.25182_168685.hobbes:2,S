Please do so. Specifically, post the part of your .config which shows how your
filesystems are configured. It looks to me like you may have accidentally compiled
ext3 as a module; if your / filesystem is ext3, it must be compiled into the kernel
in order for the kernel to mount your root filesystem and run /sbin/init.
