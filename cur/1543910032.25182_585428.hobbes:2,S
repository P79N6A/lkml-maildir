Subject: User process freezes on NFSv4 client

Hello All,
I've got NFSv4 problems on a big partition. Both NFS server and client run 
kernel version 2.6.21.6. Exported file system is on an AoE etherdrive 
(/dev/etherd/e1.1) device, having no partition table, XFS file system. The 
file system is pretty large,  8.9T. Typical file size 1-10M. 
On the client side, after much time (3-7 days) of file intensive task, the 
user process freezes. Top command shows a "D" state for it, but many other 
command trying to "touch" it, freezes, too. (ps, fuser /nfs_dir, w) None of 
the frozen processes can be killed. New processes, however, can access the 
nfs4 mounted file system. Any idea?
Thanks
Gabor Kovacs
