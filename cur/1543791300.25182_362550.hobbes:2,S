The second maintenance release of 0.99.9 series is found at the
usual place.  0.99.9a was purely to work around RPM build
issues; this one contains all the good changes in the master
branch -- mostly documentation updates, with some cvsimport
fixes from Martin.
The workaround for building RPMs has not changed since 0.99.9a,
mainly because I haven't heard back if it was good enough for
kernel.org consumption, or otherwise what changes are needed.
Note that package split we discussed earlier is not something I
consider "needed"; it is more like "nice to have before 1.0".  I
am hoping 0.99.9b to hit kernel.org machines soon, so people do
not have to be bitten by 0.99.8f glitches as reported for the
last couple of days.
That is, provided if the RPM workaround in 0.99.9a and this one
is good enough to produce an installable package, of course.
