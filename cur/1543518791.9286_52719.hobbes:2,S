Ugg.  The answer is yes* & no.  No if you are running 2.2.x  Yes* if you are
running 2.3.y, where y not too small.  Current versions of 2.3.y have
extended the mem= option to allow specifying memory regions such as
mem=64M@32M.  HOWEVER, there is a glitch which affects lilo, and possibly
other boot loaders, which means that you should disable an initial ram disk
if specifying regions this way.  This problem (and others) will be fixed.

P.S.:  The code for this is in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c

Subject: excluding an area of physical RAM
Hello,
Is there any way to have the kernel exclude a particlular area of
physical RAM? I have some broken memory that has just a slight defect
in it and I'd like the kernel to just ignore that particular memory
area and work around it.
