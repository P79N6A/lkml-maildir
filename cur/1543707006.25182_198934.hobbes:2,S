Possible.

It could be a problem with the SCSI driver. I don't have any other reports
of this.

Of course they don't help for SCSI panics, just possible for reboot
problems.

Yes, it looks very strange. I don't have a good explanation. Especially
since the behaviour changes with the compiler. It's probably some 
random memory corruption somewhere.
I will look into the reboot crashes with non standard options. 
Regarding the original reboot issues it seems to be related to C stepping 
CPUs (we never had any with B stepping).
Anyways, the reboot problem is probably not fatal for you so I guess
you can just use 2.4.24 compiled with gcc 3.2 for now.
