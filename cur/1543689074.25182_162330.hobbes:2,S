As has been already reported, this is a known bug, sorry.
And sorry, but I don't know of anyone backporting the fixes that are
needed for this to the 2.4 kernel from the changes made in 2.6.  See
the archives of this list, or linux-usb-devel or linux-usb-users for
more details about the oops and what changes need to be made for 2.4.
