 A privileged script will be able to kill the system anyway it wants, I
 don't think that this is needed.
 However, forcing an standard header on firmware images including the
 size would allow size checks without the need for an specialized tool.
 Or to prevent memory reallocation every PAGE_SIZE bytes, a tentative
 size could be written to 'loading' so its meaning would become:
 loading > 1:
 	Start/restart a load of the specified size.
 loading = 1:
 	Start/restart a load of unknown size.
 loading = 0:
 	Finish load.
 loading = -1:
 	Cancel load.

 I personally like to have explicit start/end, which also allows
 cancellation and restart of the firmware load.
