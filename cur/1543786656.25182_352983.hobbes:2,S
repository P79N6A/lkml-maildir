That's actually why I bothered sending out a report. I had *no* problems
booting with "noapic nolapic pci=noacpi" with BIOS revisions 1003 and
1004. When I saw that both you and Sean had problems, I figured I would
let you know what progress I was making.

Again, I find it odd that it worked OOB for me (with the aforementioned
boot params).
Regardless, I'm glad it is working for you now.
