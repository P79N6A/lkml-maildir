It does, because it's a hack to extend 32-bit machines beyond their
architectural lifetime.

On i386, it supports 896 MB without HIGHMEM.

Depends completely on your application mix and amount of RAM -- and
whether or not you're using 4G or 64G HIGHMEM, the latter being more
severe across a whole bunch of axes.

Go to a 64-bit CPU architecture.
