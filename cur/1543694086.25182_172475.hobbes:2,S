Interesting, that assumes sequential processing, if not semi-synchronous 
processing of events on the receiver side, which is far from guaranteed when 
considering low-level tracing especially for flight-recorder applications.  
relayfs is specifically targeted at situations where there is no implied 
synchronisation or protocol between server and clients. Indeed, where the 
receiver is undefined at the time the data is deposited.
