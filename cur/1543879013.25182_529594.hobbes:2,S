A symbol will already have the 'magic' you describe if its creator wrote 
it that way. Changing to 'menuconfig' tokens does not change that I 
think. Consider:
menu "foobar"
config FOOBAR
  bool "foobar"
  default y
config HW_RANDOM
  depends on FOOBAR
  default y
endmenu
This example should do things as you describe -- if FOOBAR is changed 
from n to y, HW_RANDOM should automatically do the same since it is a 
new option then.
menuconfig FOOBAR
  bool "foobar"
  default y
if FOOBAR
config HW_RANDOM
  default y
endif
inhibits the same behavior AFAICS.

Simplifying the depends lines is a good thing IMO.
