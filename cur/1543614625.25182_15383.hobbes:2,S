Yes, I would very much like to see EHCI support in a 2.4.x compatible form,
even if it's not in the mainline kernel. Last time I tried the CVS code, I
couldn't even get it compile, but maybe things have improved since then (two
months ago) :-)
I also have a USB 2.0 external hard drive that I'd sure like to see run at
something higher than 1 megabyte per second <G>
