For the last question, looks like "user=" is already used for that.
See 'man mount':
              user   Allow  an  ordinary  user to mount the file system.  The
                     name of the mounting user is written to mtab so that  he
                     can  unmount the file system again.  This option implies
                     the options noexec, nosuid, and nodev (unless overridden
                     by   subsequent   options,   as   in   the  option  line
                     user,exec,dev,suid).
