This discussion seems to go nowhere. Thanks for your comments. I know much
more on Linux than before.
I am happy that processes in Linux are so marvelous. Linux does not need
a decent POSIX threads implementation because the same functionality can
be achived with processes. Do what you like, you write the kernel code.
I could write my soft using fork special fetaures in Linux.
But I want it to be portable. If threads in linux are so bad, it is bad
luck for me. I will go slow. It its the only portable way todo afordable
shared memory threading without filling your program of shm-xxxx.
