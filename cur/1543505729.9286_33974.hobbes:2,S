Hi,
  I have a router with IP forwarding ON. But I need all the packets coming
in through ip_rcv() to pass through the TCP stack where I need to see the
Application level data stream after TCP has done away with sequence
numbering and stuffs like that(i.e, so that I get a coherent data .. 
without any duplicate and out-of -order data ). Can anybody suggest what
functions to invoke and where .. I am pretty much new in the linux-kernel
world and a bit lost!
My kernel is that of version 2.0.34. 
Regards,
Koushik.
