Hi Ben,
I just managed to build and boot 2.5.2 plus my patch. My named starts
without any problem. So, sorry can't reproduce it here.

This sounds weird. Normally, named binds to port 53 and some high
unprivileged port for replies from other DNS servers. Do you have some
'listen-on' and/or 'query-source' statements in your named.conf? If
you do, just change permissions of /mnt/net/ipv4/bind/921 appropriately.

You may use accessfs and capabilities in parallel, of course. But
currently, this is equivalent to "chown root/chmod u+x".
Regards, Olaf.
