Same thing, although I reverted the change and it still happens, so I must
have overlooked it before.  Which is odd, because it's right at the end of my
suspend script.  Looked to see if the cpuspeed daemon has updated recently and
it hasn't.  Strange. :)

SMP?  Not sure if it's directly tied to SMP, my other laptop I never could get
to behave when suspending.
If there's any more info I can provide or patches to try, let me know.
