I haven't be teached of anything there. I know of that since it has been
introduced in the driver. The table in question is used for keeping track
of each HBA NVRAM content and is used for applying the boot order.
This has the effect to limit the number of supported HBA to 8, in order 
not to eat too much kernel stack.
The sym53c8xx driver allocates dynamically 1 PAGE for the table and only
keeps track of a single NVRAM instance for the boot order. The max number
of supported HBAs is then more than 40.
By the way, the init code of the sym53c8xx driver is candidate for the
ncr53c8xx driver given some minor changes. I just haven't find time for  
moving this code for the moment.
