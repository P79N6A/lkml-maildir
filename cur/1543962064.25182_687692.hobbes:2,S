...cleanup post conversion to RCU.
Could we get a version of the series without all the duplication and
without the cleanups (separate into standalone pre- and post- patches)?
If you're too busy, now that I've sifted through these I could make a
simpler series that does this.
It will be a looooot easier to discuss the locking when all we're looking
at is the locking changes.
