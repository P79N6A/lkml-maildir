I'm having a simular problem, but somehow can't recreate it.
The difference is that I set the sockets to non-blocking, and
expect it to return some error.
read() returns 0, with errno set to 0, if the socket is still
open it returns -1 with errno set 11 (EAGAIN).  I can understand
those behaviours.
What I'm seeing however in an other program is that select says I
can read from the socket, and that read returns 0, with errno set
to EGAIN.  I call select() again, with returns and says I can read
from that socket ..., which keeps going on.  It stops from the
moment there is any i/o on an other socket.
Is there any way you can detect the other side is gone without
using write()?  write() shoud return an EPIPE.  Should I be able
to detect it with read(), or some oter system call?
