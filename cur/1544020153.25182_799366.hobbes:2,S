If you can reproduce this, can you send me the output of "df /; df -i
/; dumpe2fs /dev/XXX" (where XXX is your root device) before you
reboot and force an fsck?  And then can you send me the output of "df
/ ; df -i /; dumpe2fs /dev/XXX" after the 2nd reboot and forced fsck.
I've never seen anything like this, so I don't know what to make of it.
It also would be interesting to see if you can reproduce it running a
kernel from the ext4-stable branch of the ext4 tree:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git
   
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git
This has all of the ext4 fixes that is in the latest mainline, based
on the 2.6.28 kernel.
Thanks for reporting your observations,
