After Friday the 6th of August, I will have to drop off the kernel list
for a brief period.  I have a backup Email address, but I also lose my
onramp.  I am leaving my current employer at/near 4:00pm CDT.
I will try to review the stuff on "kernelnotes.org".
Look for UPDATES in kernel mirrors.

I have not forgotten everyone who has mailed me an issue lately and will
bundle the mail and carry it with me.  I will attempt to answer them
off-line and lug a floppy from box-2-box to do mail dump replies.
I apologize for the delays, but I will have my SA/NA status yanked very
soon......60 hours from now.
