As crazy as it may sound, I think it would be better to just take a guess
(use an algorithm, and some user definable rules?) and kill it.  In the
rules file, or by default, send SIGQUIT first, and if the program doesn't
leave, SIGKILL it after some predetermined wait.
I say this because 1) the server might be sitting alone in some server
farm that the owner is 90 minutes away and 2) even if the user is there,
what if the person is in a VT and it gets written to the wrong one or the
prompt gets written in X?  I'm there and willing to respond, but can't.
T'is all,
