indeed this is a new one. Entropy rekeying every 300 seconds. Most of
the overhead comes from the memcpy's - 10 usecs a pop!
this could possibly explain some earlier reports of RTC problems every
couple of minutes - on slower boxes it could easily be more than the 0.5
msec you got. (and with a 8192 Hz RTC the interrupt period is 122
usecs.)
such bhs-off spinlocked sections exclude all softirq traffic - and in
the redirected hardirqs case the hardirqs are excluded too.
