Aha, that's a good start.  During the week I'll try to look at these,
put my rubber stamp on them, and send them on to Jeff.
One thing I notice though (from your later ones, actually) is that you
seem to be moving from current 2.6 to the CVS HEAD branch.  That
includes the orinoco_usb stuff, which I still don't think is done
right and would rather not push.  I know this is asking a bir of a
favour, given how useless I've been at doing the update myself, but
your patches would be much more useful if they aimed at the CVS
"for_linus" branch.
