Subject: [PATCH] please include in 2.6.18: e100 disable device on PCI error

Hi,
Please apply the following one-liner patch to  
what will become the stable 2.6.18.  This patch is 
low-risk because it affects only the PCI error 
recovery code, which dosn't run on most platforms
(in particular, isn't invoked on current x86/ia64).
This patch was originally sent on 29 June 2006
to fix a bug that showed up in an -mm build.
The code from -mm made it into mainline, but 
this patch did not, and so we're unhappy. :-(
Here's the original patch description:
A recent patch in -mm3 titled 
gregkh-pci-pci-don-t-enable-device-if-already-enabled.patch
causes pci_enable_device() to be a no-op if the kernel thinks
that the device is already enabled.  This change breaks the
PCI error recovery mechanism in the e100 device driver, since, 
after PCI slot reset, the card is no longer enabled. This is 
a trivial fix for this problem. Tested.
