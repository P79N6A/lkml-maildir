In 2.4 kernel we now have no limit on the number of tasks running on a system
(no NR_TASKS anymore)...
I was just wondering on the efficiency of get_pid() implemetation... Although
'next_safe' concept in this function seems useful but I think we now need a
robust PID allocator..
We can have a discussion so that get_pid() can be made more effecient in future
kernel.
