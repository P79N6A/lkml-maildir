Conceivably this is useful if the IO hub does not support MMCONFIG
accesses.  The AMD 8111 does not, as far as I can see.  At least I
have an Opteron system where MMCONFIG is not supported, and I assume
it's because the 8111 doesn't provide it.  I don't know if this is
going to be a realistic scenario for Barcelona systems.
