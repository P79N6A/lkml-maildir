Subscribers-only lists hold messages from non-subscribers for owner
approval. She might just axe them (o have them automatically axed), or
forward them to the list, or let them sleep for a long time.
In any case, none of this is really relevant: Per the laws, if your message
is forwarded to the list (automatically or by hand) you must have consented
to it being published, and that means extra hassle for the list owner. She
might just throw messages away for this reason.
Perhaps the best solution would be to add a line consenting to the
publication of the message in any lists? Doesn't hurt much...
