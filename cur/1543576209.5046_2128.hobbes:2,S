FYI
The Serial ATA specification (500 pages) is now available to the public
under certain "click-to-accept" conditions.  Click the "specification"
link at the bottom of the home page at 
http://www.serialata.org/.
I hope the conditions are acceptable. The file is zipped MS Word.
This just for those that care...please do not ask me for my copy as I am a
member of this working group and bound under the NDA.
