This was a useful cleanup, and I think it revealed a bug.
Gerd, in change 11196:b85da7cd9ea5 "front: Fix rx buffer leak when
tearing down an interface." you added a call to
"add_id_to_freelist(np->rx_skbs, id);".  However, rx_skbs doesn't have
an extra entry for the list head, and there's never any corresponding
get_id_from_freelist(np->rx_skbs).  What should it be?

Yep, rearranged.  And I added an explicit separate freelist head for
tx_skbs, so it matches the grant side (which doesn't need the +1 as a
result).

Are you saying that we wouldn't need to have a private carrier flag if
we do the "netif_carrier_on(); dev_activate()" sequence instead?

Um, Herbert?

Yes, I need to look at this more closely.  It does seem that txs and rxs
will get leaked.

Guess so.  It defaults to flip.  I simplified the rx_copy/flip module
parameter to a simple rx_mode=0/1, but this is preserved from the
original.  My guess is that originally there was only flip, and copy was
added later.
