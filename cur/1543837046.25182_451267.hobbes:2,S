Hello, list.
What are the objections to makeing lkml and other lists at vget
subscribers-only?
Non-subscribers messages could still be allowed after moderation.
I get 1/4 of my spam from lkml, and see no benefit from allowing
non-subscribers to freely post to the list. If you are not subscribed,
you just have to wait until your mail gets approved by the moderator,
and it is not hard to subscribe anyway.
