I think the semaphore is a good idea, if only because it makes things much
more obviously correct - exactly because of the clear serialization. And I
don't think the serialization is a performance problem, because by the
time you start paging we're not talking about high performance shared
memory anyway, and because it's per-segment it is notgoing to make
"system" performance any worse.
In fact, my reaction to the semaphore is "do we actually need the
spinlock any more"?
