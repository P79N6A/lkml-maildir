You might want to change it, but it's a pure policy issue. And
such kind of policy should be in user space. However I can see
it being ugly to grab the list of policies from user space
(it would need a /proc file). 
Perhaps you're right and it's better to do in the kernel.
It just won't be very pretty code to convert all the masks.
