You can fix it. Keeping useful info on the screen is more important.

If you see register names followed by hex numbers, you have
some debug data. Scan forward and backward 25 lines, grabbing
all 8-digit and 16-digit hex numbers. Sort the numbers, then
look up all of them.
Crude solutions don't break as often as fancy solutions.

It could fill the screen. There is an expansion of 4-to-13 when
using the silly brackets, and a PC stack can be 6 or 7 kB long,
or perhaps many megabytes due to stack overflow. The standard
VGA screen only allows 4000 bytes of data.
