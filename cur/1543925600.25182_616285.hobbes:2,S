You are refering to the mmap_sem use in compat_linux.c:do_mmap2, aren't
you? That check for adresses > 2GB after the call to do_mmap_pgoff can
be removed since arch_get_unmapped_area already checks against
TASK_SIZE. The result of the do_mmap_pgoff call will never be out of
range. This check is a left-over from the early days of the s390 compat
code.
