Well. I bet this will be painful, and will uglify the code even more.
do_wait() has to iterate over 2 lists, __ptrace_unlink() should check
->exit_state, etc...

Sure. It would be nice to move ->children into signal_struct at first.
Except this change breaks (in fact fixes) ->pdeath_signal behaviour.
