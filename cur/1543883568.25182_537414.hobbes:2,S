This is due to _cpu_down() calling kthread_bind() in state TASK_RUNNING.
So I was sent the below, including worrisome changelog.
From: Gautham R Shenoy <ego@in.ibm.com>
We are anyway kthread_stop()ping other per-cpu kernel threads after
move_task_off_dead_cpu(), so we can do it with the stop_machine_run thread
as well.
I just checked with Vatsa if there was any subtle reason why they
had put in the kthread_bind() in cpu.c. Vatsa cannot seem to recollect
any and I can't see any. So let us just remove the kthread_bind.
