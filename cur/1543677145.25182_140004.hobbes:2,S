Subject: lockup on USB event kernel 2.4.20

My SO's computer works fine under redhat 8 which runs on a 2.4.18
kernel, however on redhat 9 with a 2.4.20 kernel it locks up.  Also,
redhat upgraded their kernel to 2.4.20 for rh 8 as well and I saw the
same behavior.
Everything works fine until she moves her mouse which is connected to
the USB, that locks the system.
Is this a known problem?  Any idea how I can debug it?
Thanks
Jay
