Assuming you can find another GPL licensable network stack (I know of
only two) then you are still going to have to deal with the fact the
core linux kernel networking interfaces are radically different to 4BSD
and/or something like ELKS. Probably much simpler is to just move to a
current 2.4 kernel with rmap patches, apply the uninline stuff to get
the size slightly down, then trim all the hash tables hard.

You need to change that anyway. 2.4.2 has plenty of bugs as well as
security holes.
