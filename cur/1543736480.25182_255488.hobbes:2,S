I just tested with 2.68.rc4 from gentoo and although it doesn't panic 
and the driver even appears to load, the kernel spews out a crash 
message in the log similar to before. The eth0 interface doesn't show 
up in ifconfig.
The alternate driver doesn't seem to be in menuconfig any longer.
I see that a bug, #3131, has been filed on bugzilla. It looks like I 
am seeing the same problem here.
