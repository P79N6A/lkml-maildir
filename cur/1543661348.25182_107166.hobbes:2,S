That is a problem with processes left running. I do not forward
connections, I do not forward X, I do not (in normal practice) leave
anything running. A typical thing to do is to go to each machine in a
cluster and look for a user activity:
  grep "user" log/stats.readers
  exit
nothing more. And every once in a while that hangs after executing the
logout sequence. With the patch it hasn't to date.
That doesn't mean it's a fix, I don't see it every day, I just haven't
seen it in a few days since I put in the patch.
