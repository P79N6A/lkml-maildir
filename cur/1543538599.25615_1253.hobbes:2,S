Doesn't that seem awfully expensive to you?  The reverse translation
would be cheaper (instead of thinking of a block as block N on hda3
think of it as N+N0 on hda, at all times throughout the kernel), but it
would still impose an overhead -- perhaps small enough not to matter.
I noticed that the BLKPG ioctl is documented as having a
read_all_partitions() call, which isn't implemented; nor does
/proc/partitions contain the base offset of each partition -- which I
must say makes me wonder what use /proc/partitions was intended to serve
at all.  Nor does it seem that these exists an ioctl() to find the base
device and offset for a partition subdevice, which I have to admit to
being rather shocked to find out.
I don't have these issues in Genesis, since I simply specify the
location to install the boot loader by path (e.g. genesis /boot).  I
have to admit to being at a loss why GRUB would need to mess with the
boot sector of an arbitrary partition that could not be specified
differently.  Note that this is quite different from saying it should
not be able to *ACCESS* such partitions, but that's a completely
different ball of wax.
