Actually, I think I have an even simpler solution, which is to change the
newstyle rule to something very simple:
	# Translate to Rules.make lists.
	O_OBJS          := $(obj-y)
	M_OBJS          := $(obj-m)
	MIX_OBJS        := $(export-objs)
	# The global Rules.make.
	include $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make
And you're done..
Does anybody see anything wrong with this approach?
It's kin dof cheesy, but I think it should work. The magic is that by
avoiding OX_OBJS and MX_OBJS, we avoid all the sorting issues. We
basically lie, and say that we don't have anything like that.
Then, MIX_OBJS picks up the stragglers, and makes sure that we consider
the proper files to be SYMTAB_OBJS.
This works for me for USB (ie just remove all the stuff with "int-y" and
multi's etc). Does it work for anybody else?
