Deprecating every module, and rewriting their initialization routines
is ambitious beyond the scale of anything you have mentioned.  Not
that 90% of the kernel code couldn't use a damn good spring cleaning,
but I'm not prepared to make such a change personally.
And remember why we're doing it: for a fairly obscure race condition.

So we go from:
int init(void)
{
	if (!register_foo(&foo))
		return -err;
	if (!register_bar(&bar)) {
		unregister_foo(&foo);
		return -err;
	}
	return 0;
}
void fini(void)
{
	unregister_foo(&foo);
	unregister_bar(&bar);
}
to:
int fini(void)
{
	if (!unregister_foo(&foo))
		return -err;
	if (!unregister_bar(&bar)) {
		if (!register_foo(&foo))
			????
		return -err;
	}
	return 0;
}

Something like this?
static int i_am_live;
static spinlock_t my_lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
/* This is our registered function. */
static int foo_function(void *somedata)
{
	int live;
	spin_lock(&my_lock);
	live = i_am_live;
	spin_unlock(&my_lock);
	if (!live)
		return -EIGNOREME???;
	...
}
int fini(void)
{
	spin_lock(&my_lock);
	i_am_live = 0;
	spin_unlock(&my_lock);
	if (!unregister_foo(&foo)) {
		spin_lock(&my_lock);
		i_am_live = 1;
		spin_unlock(&my_lock);
		return -err;
	}
	if (!unregister_bar(&bar)) {
		if (!register_foo(&foo))
			????
		spin_lock(&my_lock);
		i_am_live = 1;
		spin_unlock(&my_lock);
		return -err;
	}
	return 0;
}
Now, if someone tries to remove a module, but it's busy, you get a
window of spurious failure, even though the module isn't actually
removed.  Secondly, there is often no way of returning a value which
says "I'm going away, act as if I'm not here": only the level above
can sanely know what it would do if this were not found.

On a busy system, they're never not being used.  Your unload routine
would always fail.  Same with netfilter modules.

Exactly.  It's kept there forever, while the module is useless.

The current scheme is clean: it's two-stage delete with a nice helper
function "try_module_get()" which tells you when it's going away, and
no requirement that modules actually implement two-stage delete
themselves.  The patch to mirror this in two-stage init was posted
yesterday, as well.
It also puts the (minimal) burden in the right place: in the interface
coder's lap, not the interface user's lap.
Unfortunately, I don't have the patience to explain this once for
every kernel developer.
Rusty.
