Not everybody calls die(), instead they call __die() directly. For example
do_page_fault(), pgtable_bad(). Hence I am putting this call inside __die().
Anyway, if capture kernel is loaded, after displaying the registers and
backtrace, we probably don't want to do anything else and just boot into
capture kernel. Please find attached the modified patch.
o Start booting into the capture kernel after an Oops if system is in a
  unrecoverable state. System will boot into the capture kernel, if one is
  pre-loaded by the user, and capture the kernel core dump.
o One of the following conditions should be true to trigger the booting of
  capture kernel.
        - panic_on_oops is set.
        - pid of current thread is 0
        - pid of current thread is 1
        - Oops happened inside interrupt context.
