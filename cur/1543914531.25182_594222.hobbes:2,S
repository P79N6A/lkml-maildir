Hi Andrew,
I updated the cleanup patchset for add-vmcoreinfo.patch.
* Cleanup add-vmcoreinfo.patch v1:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0709.1/0318.html
This patchset (v2) includes a new patch[4/4] for adding a prefix
"VMCOREINFO_" to the vmcoreinfo macros. Other patches ([1/4]-[3/4])
don't have any changes.
Changelog:
  - Add "Add a prefix VMCOREINFO_ to the vmcoreinfo macros" patch.
Patchset:
[1/4] Cleanup the coding style according to Andrew's comments:
  
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/kexec/2007-August/000522.html
  - vmcoreinfo_append_str() should have suitable __attribute__s so that
    the compiler can check its use.
  - vmcoreinfo_max_size should have size_t.
  - Use get_seconds() instead of xtime.tv_sec.
  - Use init_uts_ns.name.release instead of UTS_RELEASE.
[2/4] Add nodemask_t's size and NR_FREE_PAGES's value to vmcoreinfo_data.
  The dump filetering command 'makedumpfile'(v1.1.6 or before) had assumed
  the above values, and it was not good from the reliability viewpoint.
  So makedumpfile v1.2.0 came to need these values and I created the patch
  to let the kernel output them.
  makedumpfile site:
  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/makedumpfile/
[3/4] Use the existing ia64_tpa() instead of asm code.
[4/4] Add a prefix "VMCOREINFO_" to the vmcoreinfo macros.
  Old vmcoreinfo macros were defined as generic names SYMBOL/SIZE/OFFSET
  /LENGTH/CONFIG, and it is impossible to grep for them. So these names
  should be changed. This discussion is the following:
