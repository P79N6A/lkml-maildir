I have to agree with that.  However, for those who don't, it's really easy
to do.  chmod the file 700 -- now all access other than by owner goes
through the ACL.  Deny-all to nobody, then grant read to *, and you're
done.  (You could make the mode 000 and force even the owner through the
ACL, if you dare.  VMS access checks have the additional property that the
object's owner has implicit change-mode access, so there's no way to
utterly lose control of an object.)

just one more silly change to cope with.
