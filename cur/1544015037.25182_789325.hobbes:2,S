__asm_inline was my suggestion, to distinguish "inline this
unconditionally because gcc screws up in the presence of asm()" versus
"inline this unconditionally because the world ends if it isn't" -- to
tell the human reader, not gcc.  I guess the above is a good indicator
that the __asm_inline might have been a bad name.
