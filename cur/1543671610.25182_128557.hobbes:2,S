Hi all,
Sorry about the previous post (HTML mistakenly).
Where can i find some info about ext2 performance issues ?
I would like to know if library functions like stat (not fstat) , and open
(existing or new file) are affected by the number of files that exists in
1. the number of files in the file's directory
2. the number of files in the file system.
Are you aware of any improvements in latest kernels ?
Please CC me on your answer.
Thanks,
Nir
