Should be ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp.
That's assuming it needs to be cacheline aligned at all.  It can consume a
lot of space.
<looks>
oh, this should be allocated with alloc_percpu(), in which case the
open-coded alignment can perhaps go away.

use get_cpu() here.

all these NR_CPUS loops need to go away.  Use either
for_each_possible_cpu() or, preferably, for_each_online_cpu() and a hotplug
notifier.
Why is this code using per-cpu data at all, btw?  These optimisations tend
to be marginal in filesystems.  What is the perfomance impact of making
this data be single-superblock-wide-instance?

alloc_percpu()
