That package doesn't have a nice automake/autconf installer, so I didn't
run across the reset_vga thingy at first.  I did, however, make it work
with mode3:
1. SSH in
2. init 3
3. mode3
4. init 5
5. Close SSH
6. Walk over to the box
7. Log into all the text mode ttys (tty[1-6]), type "clear" and log out.
You're right though.  This shouldn't be happening in the first place.
