Subject: 2.6.7-bk way too fast

Something is definitely screwy with the latest -bk.  I updated from a 
kernel ~1 week ago, and all timer-related stuff is moving at a vastly 
increased rate.  My guess is twice as fast.  Most annoying is the system 
clock advances at twice normal rate, and keyboard repeat is so sensitive 
I am spending quite a bit of time typing this message, what with having 
to delettte (<== example) extra characters.  Double-clicking is also 
broken :(
dmesg and config attached.
My guess would be someone broke HPET, but maybe not judging from other 
lkml reports.
This is the _first_ 2.6 kernel that has been obviously and wildly broken 
for me :(
