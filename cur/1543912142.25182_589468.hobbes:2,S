futex stands for Fast Userspace muTEX, please lets call it a rt_mutex.

-rt does all of the irq handler in thread (process) context, the hard
irq handler just does something akin to a wakeup.
These irq threads typically run fifo/50 or simething like that.
[ note that this allows a form of irq priorisation even if the hardware
