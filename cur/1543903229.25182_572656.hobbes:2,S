This change means that we'll run the irq handler at request_irq()-time even
for non-shared interrupts.
This is a bit of a worry.  See, shared-interrupt handlers are required to
be able to cope with being called when their device isn't interrupting. 
But nobody ever said that non-shared interrupt handlers need to be able to
cope with that.
Hence these non-shared handlers are within their rights to emit warning
printks, go BUG or accuse the operator of having busted hardware.
So bad things might happen because of this change.  And if they do, they
will take a loooong time to be discovered, because non-shared interrupt
handlers tend to dwell in crufty old drivers which not many people use.
So I'm wondering if it would be more prudent to only do all this for shared
handlers?
