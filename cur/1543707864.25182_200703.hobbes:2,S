Yes. Though I do reserve the right to find this highly silly, that we
might end up with multiple hooks for clustering infrastructure in the
kernel...
So, how does OpenGFS/GFS achieve the communication? How does it interact
with the infrastructure (which, I infere from your above comments, is
meant to reside in user-space)?
