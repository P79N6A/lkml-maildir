This can be done in a very natural way with our abstraction, and the 
"hello.c" example happens to do exactly that:
  aldebaran:~/perf-counter-test> ./hello
  doing perf_counter_open() call:
  counter[0]... fd: 3.
  counter[1]... fd: 4.
  counter[0] delta: 10866 cycles
  counter[1] delta: 414 cycles
  counter[0] delta: 23640 cycles
  counter[1] delta: 3673 cycles
  counter[0] delta: 28225 cycles
  counter[1] delta: 3695 cycles
This counts cycles executed and instructions executed, and reads the two 
counters out at the same time.
I just modified it to measure the exact example you mentioned above - L2 
cache misses and instructions completed, sampled once every second:
  titan:~/perf-counter-test> ./hello
  doing perf_counter_open() call:
  counter[0] delta: 1 cachemisses
  counter[1] delta: 497 instructions
  counter[0] delta: 14 cachemisses
  counter[1] delta: 4303 instructions
  counter[0] delta: 6 cachemisses
  counter[1] delta: 3666 instructions
  counter[0] delta: 2 cachemisses
  counter[1] delta: 3641 instructions
  counter[0] delta: 1 cachemisses
  counter[1] delta: 3641 instructions
It's a matter of:
        fd1 = perf_counter_open(PERF_COUNT_CACHE_MISSES, 0, 0, 0, -1);
        fd2 = perf_counter_open(PERF_COUNT_INSTRUCTIONS, 0, 0, 0, -1);
So it's very much possible. (If i've missed something about your example 
then please let me know.)

We could add that facility if it makes sense - there's no reason why 
there couldnt be event interaction between counters - we just went for 
the most common event variants in v1.
Btw., i'm curious, why would we want to do that? It skews the results if 
the task continues executing and counters stop. To get the highest 
quality profiling output the counters should follow the true state of the 
task that is profiled - and events should be passed to the monitoring 
task asynchronously. The _events_ can contain precise coupled information 
- but the counters should continue.
What i'd do is what hello.c does: if you want to read out multiple 
counters at once, you can read them out at once.
(Again, please explain in more detail if i have missed something about 
your observation.)
