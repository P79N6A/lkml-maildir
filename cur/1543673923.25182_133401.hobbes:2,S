(i) this brings NCR5380.c a tiny little bit closer to sun3_NCR5380.c
(ii) I am not so happy with SAM_STAT_GOOD etc.
Maybe it is just me, but I do not immediately think of SCSI given SAM.
We have sym_defs.h with
#define S_GOOD          (0x00)
#define S_CHECK_COND    (0x02)
...
and aiclib.h with
#define SCSI_STATUS_OK                  0x00
#define SCSI_STATUS_CHECK_COND          0x02
...
and scsi.h with
#define SAM_STAT_GOOD            0x00
#define SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION 0x02
...
I wouldn't mind merging these three and choosing the SCSI_STATUS_ prefix.
