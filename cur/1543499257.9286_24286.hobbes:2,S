Hi everybody,
I just grepped through the kernel includes 
(checked Versions: 2.2.9-2.3.6) and noticed a different prototype
for "kernel_thread()" (I mean linkage and return value) for every
arch.
I don't know who relies on these special prototypes, so I'm not
able to fix this trivial problem :(
Regards
Ingo Oeser
