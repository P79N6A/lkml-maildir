Not so. Assuming the admin is restoring to the same bad drive (the
twit!), since the drive does do relocate on write, the recovery will
work, the data will be whole, and life will be good.
I'm not sure why one would do a by-sector backup, but I guess for some
filesystems or raw database info it might be useful.
