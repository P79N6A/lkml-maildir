Unforch, it appears that Makefile is broken as its expecting to find a
link named linux in the /usr/src dir that points at the present kernels
tree.  Per Linus's instructions that link was removed what, 2 years ago?
Anywho, its exiting rather quickly with this message:
[root@coyote v4l-dvb]# make distclean
make -C /usr/src/v4l-dvb/v4l distclean
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/v4l-dvb/v4l'
find . -name '*.c' -type l -exec rm '{}' \;
find . -name '*.h' -type l -exec rm '{}' \;
rm -f *~ *.o *.ko *.mod.c
rm -f .version .*.o.flags .*.o.d .*.o.cmd .*.ko.cmd
rm -rf .tmp_versions
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/v4l-dvb/v4l'
Which looks ok, so...
[root@coyote v4l-dvb]# make
make -C /usr/src/v4l-dvb/v4l
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/v4l-dvb/v4l'
echo "No version yet."
No version yet.
uname -r|perl -ne 'if (/^([0-9]*)\.([0-9])*\.([0-9]*)(.*)$/) { printf
("VERSION=%s\nPATCHLEVEL:=%s\nSUBLEVEL:=%s\nKERNELRELEASE:=%s.%s.%s%s\n"
,$1,$2,$3,$1,$2,$3,$4); };' > ./.version
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/v4l-dvb/v4l'
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/v4l-dvb/v4l'
creating symbolic links...
find: ../linux/drivers/usb/media: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [links] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/v4l-dvb/v4l'
make: *** [all] Error 2
The ./v4l/.version file:
VERSION=2
PATCHLEVEL:=6
SUBLEVEL:=14
KERNELRELEASE:=2.6.14.3
which appears correct to me.
