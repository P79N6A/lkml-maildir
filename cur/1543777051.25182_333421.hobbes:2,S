Hmmm... no, no. A connect() on non-blocking socket will NEVER return
EINTR. SUSV3 and Linux code agree.
A syscall isn't magically interrupted if a signal arrives... it's the
syscall that must check for pending signals and do the proper action
(usually it will return with -EINTR or -ERESTARTSYS).
A connect() on a blocking socket is something like this (very
approssimative):
	1) code to activate the connection
	2) sleep waiting for something (connection ready / signal received...)
	3) if connection is ready then return 0, else if there are pending
	signals return -ERESTARTSYS
With non-blocking socket the syscall never sleeps, and never checks for
pending signals.
Look at "net/ipv4/af_inet.c": in particular at "net_wait_for_connect"
and its usage in "inet_stream_connect".
