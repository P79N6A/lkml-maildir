Hmm...
Until today I thought that it is a good administration style to create a 
several gigabyte swap partition (which is normally almost unused, but 
just for the case that some program needs much virtual memory), and use 
tmpfs for /tmp.
I thought that it is good for two reasons - disk space is not wasted for 
/tmp (and /tmp still has several gigabytes of space), and short-living 
temporary files such as gcc intermediate files normally reside in memory, 
which is more effective than using a filesystem on a disk.
If I understand you correctly, the above is not true at least for a 
desktop system with 256M of RAM?
And what about LTSP server with 2 gigabytes of RAM (and 6 gigabytes of 
swap) that normally runs 10-15 KDE sessions with mozilla's and 
openoffice's?

Thank you.
