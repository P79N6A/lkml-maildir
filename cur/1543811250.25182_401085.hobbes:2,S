Thanks for fixing that.  Have we decided that file sharing of this sort 
is a really bad idea yet?  I still see early_printk and  pci-direct.h 
sharing remains.  If this sharing really must go on, isn't there a less 
ad-hoc way to do it?  Or at least a mention in the file that "before you 
modify, note this is shared by arch foo".
