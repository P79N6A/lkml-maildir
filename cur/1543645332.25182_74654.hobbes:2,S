Don't know what version of X you've been running, but i haven't
had a problem for over 8 months (since XFree86 4.2). Before then,
the 4.1.99 CVS was needed for radeon support which was of course
a developer branch, although i never experienced the sort of problems
you describe.
Definately rock solid and stable on my 7500 mobility.
