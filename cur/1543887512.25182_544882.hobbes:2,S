This may not be the most useful datapoint, but applying the patch to 
current -git didn't give me something that qemu could boot.
I applied the patch to current -git (well, current -hg but same thing).  The 
flat patch didn't quite apply cleanly.  (Hunks in Documentation, video.S, and 
verify_cpu.S claimed to be already applied.  I told it to ignore them.)  The 
result compiled cleanly enough, but didn't boot under qemu.  (It 
said "booting from hard drive" and then hung.  No decompressing message.)  
I've confirmed that without the patch, current -hg does boot under qemu.
Awaiting the broken-out patchset mentioned earlier, with interest if not 
skill... :)
