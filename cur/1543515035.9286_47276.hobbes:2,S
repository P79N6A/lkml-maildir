That makes it easier.
#if	LINUX_VERSION_CODE < VERSION(2,3,0)
#define	check_mem_region(start,n)	/* mem #start size #n */
#endif	/* LINUX_VERSION_CODE */
Should take care of the problem, allowing the driver to work under either
the 'stable' version or the development version.
I think you will find that you'll have problems with your hot swap and
bridges, it really should be the PCI subsystem that decides what areas of
PCI are used or not. Once it is put in the configuration register, that
should be the end of it. 
I think that having all the PCI device drivers do check_mem_region() and
request_mem_region() is going to cause problems.
