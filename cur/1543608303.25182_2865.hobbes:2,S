Hi,
I see something similar with vanilla 2.4.13 (+devfs), except my 
unkillable xterms don't appear until a modprobe has already failed. 
Specifically, what seems to happen is:
- an open() call causes the kernel to grab the devfs rwsem for reading, 
and then load a module (e.g. ide-cd).
- the modprobe process then waits forever for write-access to the devfs 
rwsem.
Each xterm then waits forever in "wait_for_devfsd_finished()", 
presumably when it tries to close its terminal.
Are you also using dynamic module loading? Are ALL of your unkillable 
processes xterms, or do you also have a failed modprobe lurking somewhere?
Chris
