I believe Ive found a bug in the ARP code in 2.2.14.
I have a 2.2.14 box with IP aliases on 2 different logical subnets.
They're on the same physical ethernet though.
The IP addresses are 210.9.66.13 and 203.37.38.11.
There is a Tigris digital NAS supporting modems on the 210.9.66 subnet.
From a modem on the NAS, if I ping 203.37.38.11 here is the tcpdump
output
21:46:56.157251 eth0 < 210.9.66.116 > 203.37.38.11: icmp: echo request
21:46:56.157377 eth0 > arp who-has 210.9.66.116 tell 203.37.38.11
(48:54:e8:27:64:1d)
The ARP request for the modem on the 210 subnet appears to be going out
over the 203 subnet and doesnt get a reply.
Heres is the output from the same situation for a box running 2.0
21:46:07.730652 210.9.66.116 > 203.37.38.19: icmp: echo request
21:46:07.730652 arp who-has 210.9.66.116 tell 210.9.66.10
21:46:07.730652 arp reply 210.9.66.116 is-at 8:0:3:6:d:89
21:46:07.730652 203.37.38.19 > 210.9.66.116: icmp: echo reply
Here the ARP request correctly goes out over the 210 subnet.
There is one other oddity however, if I do a ping from a modem on an
Annex terminal server it works ok as follows.
21:52:13.026118 eth0 < 210.9.66.185 > 203.37.38.11: icmp: echo request
21:52:13.026251 eth0 > 203.37.38.11 > 210.9.66.185: icmp: echo reply
21:52:18.024894 eth0 > arp who-has 210.9.66.185 tell 210.9.66.13
(48:54:e8:27:64:1d)
21:52:18.025925 eth0 < arp reply 210.9.66.185 is-at 0:80:2d:4:98:59
(48:54:e8:27:64:1d)
Although for some reason the ARP is showing up after the ping reply has
gone out.
Anyway, as far as I can tell, there is some interaction between the
Tigris and the 2.2.14 box that is causing problems. It wouldnt
particularly surprise me if there was some kind of bug in the Tigris
networking stack. But the 2.2.14 box seems to be doing the wrong thing.
