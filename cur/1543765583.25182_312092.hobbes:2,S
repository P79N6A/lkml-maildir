Yes, you're correct of course.  Of course, I'll note that people who
*not* on the path have to not only guess the ISN, but they also have
to somehow know that there is a TCP connection between hosts A and B,
and what ports they are using.  Someone not on the path isn't
necessarily going to know this, unless there are publically accessible
SNMP-enabled routers that are overly free with this sort of
information.  (Loose lips sink ships!)

True, although the longer it takes to break the crypto, the greater
the uncertainty of how much data has gone across the connection, which
makes the problem harder in other ways.

But ssh is pretty easy, and even if you completely ignore the host key
issue (to protect you against man-in-the-middle attacks), a simple
diffie-helman type approach is plenty to protect you against the class
of attacks which the randomized ISN buys you.
