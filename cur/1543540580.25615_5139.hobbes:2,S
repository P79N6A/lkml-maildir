Forgive my ignorance (I am newbie) but what exactly are you talking about?
You can have CRYPTO APIs supported by the OS with external plug ins to do
the
actual work.  You then can ship different plugins to different places.
Example HP-UX and others use something called CDSA.  You can have crypto
libraries ship with the OS
something like the libraries RSA ships. You can even have extra system calls
for encryption.
The next question is what bit of code do you want to make hard to
distribute.
The user code?  the entire OS?  just one or two shared libraries?  Remember
the problem is not just the US laws.  It is the French laws,  The Russian
laws, etc...
(Until recently the French even kept out 56 bit DES)
So the question boils down to: What is the end goal?

Hello Linux kernal and Mozilla lists,
Sorry for the cross posting, but I have been asked by members of both lists 
whether now would be a good time to add cryptography to open source 
programs and urged to post my reply to the list.  As some of you may know, 
I served as the lead attorney in the Bernstein case challenging the 
government's regulation of encryption technology.
Although the regulations as issued in January (and the modifications 
proposed recently by BXA) are still overly complex and problematic, they do 
provide some real opportunities to include strong cryptography in public, 
nonprofit open source projects.
If any of you would be interested in pursuing the question further, I'd be 
happy to discuss it.  Please feel free to drop me an e-mail or give me a
call.
Cindy
