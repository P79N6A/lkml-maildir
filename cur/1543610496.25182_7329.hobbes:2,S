I used sed, but yes the following does
the same as downloading and applying the patch:
find linux -type f | xargs perl -wi -pe 's/[<space><tab>]+$//'
(obviously replace <space> & <tab> with the appropriate chars).
Note also that after (bz2) compression the space saving drops
from 224,654 to 139,669 bytes, which is still good.
