Actually that _was_ that patch long ago, but I was told it is too
dangerous: malicious user could gain /dev/tty1 access and then fry
monitor with blank/unblank/blank/unblank.
This is not concern for users which have console access, because they
could just use hammer on monitor :-). Or maybe I'm just too paranoid
and should add TIOCLINUX ioctl?
