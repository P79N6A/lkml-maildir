Works OK here with a simple test:
	sleep 10000 < /dev/hda5 &
	cat < some-file > /dev/hda5
	sync
	<press reset>
	cmp some-file /dev/hda5
LILO does a global sync itself before quitting.  Check to see if there's a
lot of writeout happening.  See if there's writeout happening when you run
sync manually.
Maybe take a copy of /dev/hda1 into a regular file, then reboot, then
compare with what's on the disk.
Check that /proc/meminfo:Dirty goes to zero after `sync'.
