 The timer_ack variation exploits the polling mode of the i8259A with the
AEOI enabled.  It's a valid configuration.  It's needed for a correct
operation of the timer interrupt handler and the NMI watchdog in certain
configurations.  What's there in the datasheets you that makes you think
the code is a mistake?  A reference would be appreciated.
