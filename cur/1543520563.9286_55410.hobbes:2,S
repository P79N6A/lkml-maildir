 Bash calls NSS upon startup, which in turn tries to connect to nscd using
a net-pf-1 (unix) socket.  This is how it is implemented within glibc
2.1.x.  Now loading net-pf-1 when there is no modules.dep is logged using
syslog (of course if modules.dep is in place, the connect() call fails
because there is no nscd running at this stage but the unix module has to
be examined).  The avilability of /usr or whatever does not matter.

 Booting into emergency modes does not necessarily mean the system is
damaged.  Using emergency removable media is certainly a lot of hassle,
especially on systems where floppy support is not that easy (ever tried to
get a SCSI floppy disk drive, for example?).
 The modprobe hack I proposed is inexpensive and lies solely within
userland.  So what's the problem?
