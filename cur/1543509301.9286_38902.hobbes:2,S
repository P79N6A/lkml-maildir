Subject: [PATCH] isofs may compute wrong size for large files

Hi,
There's a bug in fs/isofs/inode.c which causes it to get the wrong
size for some large files.  It's triggered by having the
iso_directory_entrys describing a file go across more than one block,
with a empty record at the end of the first block.  There's code to
handle that case, but it's slightly wrong.
The CD in question contains mp3s, and was burned on NT.  I suspect
that mkisofs doesn't lay out the dir entries the same way, or this
would have been noticed earlier.
Todd
p.s.  Is there an official maintainer of isofs who should get this?
While tracking this down I noticed there have been a few isofs patches
to lkml recently that didn't get into the kernel...
