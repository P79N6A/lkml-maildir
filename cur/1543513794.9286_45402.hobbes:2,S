I assume it saves to a file, right?  I didn't know about this in svgalib. 
If it saves to a file, I assume I could copy the saved from another machine
and load it on the one that's not working.  Same video hw and mobo.  I
really don't care if it crashes trying this (just prefer it not, but either
way I'd have to reboot)
