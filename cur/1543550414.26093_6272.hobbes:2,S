Forgive me if this has been asked before, but has there ever been any
thought of having a 'nice' value for disk accesses?.  I was on a
server with 4 CPU's but only 2 SCSI disks.  Many times I'll see 4 processes
on disk wait, 3 of them at a cpu-nice of 19 while the foreground processes
get bogged down by the lower priority processes due to disk contention.
I've also thought before a simple 'netnice' would be good as well -- real
nice and easy to use, lets see:
netnice
disknice
cpunice
nice <number>| -p <cpunice> , -d <disknice>, -n <netnice, -a <all nice>
Just wondering...
