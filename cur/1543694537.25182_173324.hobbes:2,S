The ATI AGPGART driver _always_ used the format it currently does.
Since day 1, when it was written _by ATI engineers_
Your "ATI wants the IDs in two letter form" differs depending on which
ATI engineer you talk to it seems.
Personally, as agpgart maintainer, I couldn't care less what the defines
end up being, as long as it still compiles afterwards.
