/etc/modules.conf is quite useful if you work with /dev files w/0 devfs, 
protocol families etc.
Example: you have your sound driver compiled as a module. In /dev you have 
a couple of sound character devs with major number 14. Now you write an 
alias for it into your /etc/modules.conf:
alias	char-major-14	soundcore
Example: you have your ipv6 over ipv4 compiled as a module. Your protocol 
family 41 requires ipv6 to be loaded. Therefore say:
alias	net-pf-41	ipv6
Regards,
Thunder
