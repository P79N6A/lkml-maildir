If you still don't want to explain what "use of the Patented
Process" means, you should better remove that license and just say that
every use of the patent in any form has to be licensed individually. That
would be far more honest. As the license stands now it's more cause for
confusion than helpful.
Everyone likes bitching about the FSF, but at least they clerly explain
what they mean. If yoy can't do that, don't mention the GPL in your
license. Your are only using it as an excuse to call your license "open".
bye, Roman
