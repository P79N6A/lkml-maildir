Which actually annoy me a lot!
Maybe that just me, but I cannot see why I have to go down deep
in the architecture specific directory to locate the kernel.
But I have no brilliant idea how to solve it right away.

I would like an easy way to do a full build, including supporting stuff
such as documentation. Think about doing regression on new kernels?
Today you have to specify a lot of different targets to accomplish
this - something that many people simply do not do.
Make it easy, and people will do it - and see more errors fixed earlier.
allyes, allmodules, allno were introduced for regression purpose.
And make all gives me the association that ALL is build, not only
the core kernel. Therefore I object against the make all semantic
that you suggest.
Better reserve that to a full build.
Furthermore I would advocate for a new target [yes one more!].
"make help"
make help shall generate a short list of available targets, something like:
<<<<<<<<<<<<
>make help
Configuration related targets:
  oldconfig	- bla bla
  menuconfig	- bla bla
  config	- bla bla
  configallyes  - ....
  configallno	- ....
Other generic targets:
  vmlinux	- The generic binary kernel
* modules	- Build all modules
# pdfdocs	- documentation
  all		- Build all targets marked with * and #
Architecture specific targets for current architecture (I386)
* bzImage	- Default compressed kernel (arch/i386/boot/bzImage)
  zImage	- Another target (arch/i386/boot/zImage)
Executing "make" or "make kernel" builds targets marked with '*'
<<<<<<<<<<
The architecture specific stuff should obviously be located in the
corresponding architecture specific makefiles and triggered by archhelp.
Comments?
I would be happy to do a patch if people support this.
