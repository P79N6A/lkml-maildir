Hmm, unlike modutils, I've never even used mkinitrd, let alone read
the code (mmm... shell... yum!).  For that reason alone I'm not the
guy to take it over (plus, I'm extremely lazy).
Herbert, I'd be happy to discuss any mkinitrd changes, or put a patch
into module-init-tools (or the FAQ?).
Thanks!
Rusty.
