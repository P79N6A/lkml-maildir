Clearly my braindead parser failed here. The time of aa1 should probably be 82 
seconds (41.0 x 2) Can you check the full log of 2.4.20-rc1aa1.log ? It has 
raw results.

If the error continued here (2 runs of process_load) then the time of aa1 
should be 133.9 x 2. Can you check the full log of 2.4.20-rc1aa1.log here 
too?

With only one run these numbers appear not to be greatly statistically 
significant, except for the mem_load results.
