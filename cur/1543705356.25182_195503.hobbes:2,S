Len, this is a really good idea making this available.  May I suggest
you also have people provide patches between the original and their
modified versions, so it's easy for everyone to see what was changed?
Thanks,
Matt (who's not looking forward to pulling 20 systems from the
hardware library and flashing BIOSses to pull the original DSDT to
compare with what users suggest need to be fixed for each one before
he can file bug reports with the BIOS writers...)
