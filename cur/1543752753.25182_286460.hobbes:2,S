One of the reasons that ia32 doesn't support 64-bit divide directly is
because it is a big red flag that you are probably doing something wrong.
This is a prime example - why do a divide when you could do a shift:
        maxnr = (pci_resource_len(dev, bar) - board->first_offset) >>
                (board->reg_shift + 3);
Cheers, Andreas
