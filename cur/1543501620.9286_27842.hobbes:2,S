A testing suite assumes that the features we want from the kernel
are known in advance. The problem is that linux is constantly
changing. For the test suite to have any meaning, it has to 
at least evolve as fast as linux. That is heck of a task.
If you have any ideas how to separate out ther rapidly changing
features of kernel from the slowly changing ones, you might
interest some people.
