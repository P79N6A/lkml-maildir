I'm hoping that with testing over a large number of SMP systems (dual
celeries -> 8-way 2MB xeon's at least) that there's enough effective
overlap to make this possible... if the "best" values for a given accepted
workload vary largely enough over a range of machines, we could pick the
"least damage" value and possible have a CONFIG_ option for "Tunable
SMP scheduling"?  Or would that still be a poor choice for 2.4.x?
