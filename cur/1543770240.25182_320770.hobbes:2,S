Subject: [PATCH 2.6.12-rc5-mm1 1/4] perfctr: seqlocks for mmap:ed state: common
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Andrew,
This set of patches changes perfctr's low-level drivers to indicate
changes to the mmap:ed counter state via a unified seqlock mechanism.
This cleans up user-space, enables user-space fast sampling in some
previously impossible cases (x86 w/o TSC), and eliminates a highly
unlikely but not impossible failure case on x86 SMP.
This is a rewrite of a patch originally from David Gibson.
perfctr seqlocks 1/4: common changes
- define write_perfseq_begin/end in <linux/perfctr.h>
- bump version and sync it with current user-space package
