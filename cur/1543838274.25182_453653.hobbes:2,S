Keith, 2.4 kernel build doesn't seem to have this issue. Is this problem
specific to 2.6 kbuild?
"info make" says this.
<snip>
Note that any job that is marked recursive (*note Instead of Executing
the Commands: Instead of Execution.)  doesn't count against the total
jobs (otherwise we could get `N' sub-`make's running and have no slots
left over for any real work!)
</snip>
Are we doing something different in 2.6 kbuild?
thanks,
suresh
