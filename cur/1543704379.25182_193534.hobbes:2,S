hi,
> i'm also going to test my systems with ttcp, because at the moment i'm transferring my backup from the server to my machine with 105.48 kB/s over the gigabit line via ftp :( but cpu is normal on both machines.
i did some tests now, here are the results.
box1 = 2.6.0 (tg3 driver v2.3, nov5/03)
box2 = 2.6.2-rc1-mm2 (tg3 v2.5, dec22/03)
box1 was sending, box2 receiving:
box1 # ttcp -t -l 65536 -v -b 2097152 -s -D -n100000 192.168.0.3
ttcp-t: buflen=65536, nbuf=100000, align=16384/0, port=5001, sockbufsize=2097152  tcp  -> 192.168.0.3
ttcp-t: socket
ttcp-t: sndbuf
ttcp-t: nodelay
ttcp-t: connect
ttcp-t: -2036334592 bytes in 1247.57 real seconds = 1768.00 KB/sec +++
ttcp-t: -2036334592 bytes in 30.01 CPU seconds = 73492.73 KB/cpu sec
ttcp-t: 100000 I/O calls, msec/call = 12.78, calls/sec = 80.16

------------------------------------------
now the opposite, box2 was sending, box1 receiving:
box2 ttcp # ttcp -t -l 65536 -v -b 2097152 -s -D -n100000 192.168.0.2
ttcp-t: buflen=65536, nbuf=100000, align=16384/0, port=5001, sockbufsize=2097152  tcp  -> 192.168.0.2

i thought the cable could be defective because of the results, but i tested with another machine (windows xp, 100mbit card) and both up and download speed via ftp (from both boxes!) was at about 8-9MB/s. so no problem with the cable and it seems also no problem with 100mbit, but as soon as i connect the two tg3 cards together with 1000mbit, one direction is slow (cable is gbit certified and worked with 2.4 kernels without any problem).
as i already mentionend in a previous email, the errors on the tg3 cards are quite high, but only in RX:
box1:
RX packets:18585312 errors:102500 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:102598
TX packets:12435471 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
box2:
RX packets:6864695 errors:202162 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:204652
TX packets:10049776 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
cpu usage was also normal in every test (about 15-30%).
