size_fifo() is claimed to be unreliable at detecting the FIFO size,
so I don't feel safe about using it here.
I'd suggest something like:
	serial_outp(port, UART_LCR, UART_LCR_DLAB);
	efr = serial_in(port, UART_EFR);
	if ((efr & 0xfc) == 0) {
		serial_out(port, UART_EFR, 0xac | (efr & 3));
		/* if top 6 bits return zero, its motorola */
		if (serial_in(port, UART_EFR) == (efr & 3)) {
			/* motorola port */
		} else {
			/* ST16C650V1 port */
		}
		/* restore old value */
		serial_outb(port, UART_EFR, efr);
	}
If you can guarantee that the lower two bits will always be zero, you can
drop the frobbing to ignore/preseve the lower two bits.
