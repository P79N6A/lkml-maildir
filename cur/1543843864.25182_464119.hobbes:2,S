You just don't want to listen, this is *not* a question of a modifiable
table or not. It's a question of *how* code needs to be added to the
syscall path, we both know why a modifiable table is not going to
happen. How do you plan to handle vdso based syscalls with LTT?

You know what, I give up. Your primary interest seems to be in attacking
people personally because they didn't start out jumping up and down
clapping their hands in support of your pet project. Even if I wanted to
I couldn't tell you about the number of different projects I have
worked, partly because I can't remember half of them, partly because of
contract limitation, and most importantly because I do not need to
justify my experience to you.
