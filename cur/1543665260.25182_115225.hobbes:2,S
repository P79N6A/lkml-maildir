Yes, p3/500 w. 128mb ram and rage128.

I plugged your combo patch into virgin .64.

I can (could with your earlier patches anyway) eliminate the X stalls by 
setting X junk to SCHED_FIFO.  I don't have ram to plug in, but I'm as 
certain as I can be without actually doing so that it's not ram shortage.
Best would be for other testers to run some tests.  With the make -j30 
weirdness, I _suspect_ that other oddities (hmm... multi-client db load... 
query service time) will show.
