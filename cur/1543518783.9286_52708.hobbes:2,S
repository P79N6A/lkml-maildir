What is "11 minute mode" anyway?  I did happen to catch that thread on a
web archive (where I read linux-kernel regularly) but didn't see any
explanation.  Or maybe I just don't want to know...

How odd.  In any case, its obviously not staying in synch even when it
succeeds as it does this every hour.

Yes.  The only difference is my system gets really sluggish as it hammers
out the I/O.  Still just sits there.

Somehow it managed to *subtract* almost three *years* from my hardware
clock.  If it's supposed to add it's doing something REALLY wrong. :)

Well I haven't set any of this up myself.  I have ntpd keeping in sync
with a nearby router, and just the hwclock system<->hardware setup before
booting everything and after shutting down everything.  This has never
been a problem until Nov 17 when I began a constant CPU load of 2.00+
running the distnet CSC contest.  There were no hwclock hangs or any
set_rtc_mmss messages before then.
