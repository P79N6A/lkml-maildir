Subject: [ANNOUNCE] udev 038 release
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've released the 038 version of udev.  It can be found at:
 	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-038.tar.gz
(yes, the last announcement was for 034, things have been moving
fast...)
udev allows users to have a dynamic /dev and provides the ability to
have persistent device names.  It uses sysfs and /sbin/hotplug and runs
entirely in userspace.  It requires a 2.6 kernel with CONFIG_HOTPLUG
enabled to run.  Please see the udev FAQ for any questions about it:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ
For any udev vs devfs questions anyone might have, please see:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev_vs_devfs
And there is a general udev web page at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev.html
More bugfixes, and hopefully the "udev is locked in a loop taking all of
the cpu" bug is now gone.  Also, lots of wait_for_sysfs updates thanks
to all who has reported them.
Thanks to everyone who has send me patches for this release, a full list
of everyone, and their changes is below.
udev development is done in a BitKeeper repository located at:
	bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/udev
Daily snapshots of udev from the BitKeeper tree can be found at:

If anyone ever wants a tarball of the current bk tree, just email me.
thanks,
