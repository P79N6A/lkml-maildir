using the dynticks code from the -rt kernel makes the overhead of an 
idle guest go down by a factor of 10-15:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 2556 mingo     15   0  598m 159m 157m R  1.5  8.0   0:26.20 qemu
( for this to work on my system i have added a 'hyper' clocksource 
  hypercall API for KVM guests to use - this is needed instead of the 
  running-to-slowly TSC. )
