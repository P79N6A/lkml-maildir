Yes, that doesn't matter.  But it seems that the svn tree is vastly
different from the in-kernel code.  So much so that some companies feel
that the in-kernel stuff just isn't worth running at all.

It takes a _lot_ of effort to ignore them, as it's very difficult to do
so.  Especially when companies try to play the different distros off of
each other, but that's not an issue that the mainline kernel developers
need to worry about :)

Yes, that does make me happy.  But it doesn't make me happy to see IBM
not being able to participate in kernel development by posting and
defending their own code to lkml.  I thought IBM knew better than
that...
