What you call an ad is the result of evolution of several resendings
of similar emails, and answering FAQs.  This is the stuff that has
proven useful over time.
To call that an advertisement is to insult the kernel developers
that asked these questions, which are answered in the doc.  They were
not requesting endorsements, they were asking honest questions about
ways to optimize their kernel development, and merging with Linus.
Responding with an intro on how BK clones work has proven to be a
good first step to that.
