I haven't seen that the scheduler patch series got applied yet.  This 
Cell spu task notification patch is a pre-req for OProfile development 
to support profiling SPUs.   When the scheduler patch gets applied to a 
kernel version that fits our needs for our OProfile development, I don't 
see any problem in using the sched_flags field instead of notify_active.

Yes, the yield() and the memory barriers were leftovers from an earlier 
ill-conceived attempt at solving this problem.  They should have been 
removed.  They're gone now.

I hesitated doing this since it would entail changing spu_switch_notify 
from being static to non-static.  I'd like to get Arnd's opinion on this 
question before going ahead and making such a change.
