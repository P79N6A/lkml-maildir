that sounds bad ... Could you send me the output of:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/cfs-debug-info.sh
while such delays are happening? Please enable CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y and 
CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS=y as well before doing the dump. Also please send your 
.config.
to get best output from cfs-debug-info.sh, please first run this:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/cfs-debug-info-clear.sh
then reproduce the delay, and then run cfs-debug-info.sh to capture all 
that task stats.
