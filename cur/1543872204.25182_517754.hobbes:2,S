No, because there is no need to use APIC. You just pave the road for
doing the same thing to IO_APIC and whatever is on your interest next.

And why exactly do you need the APIC operations for the complete
abstract and virtual clock event device ? To inject the interrupt, which
you anyway inject artificially into the paravirtualized kernel ? 
This is simply wrong and does not help anything. The 3 lines of code you
share with the apic timer code are not a valid reason to hook yourself
into the apic.
You can use any arbitrary interrupt number to fire your VMI timer and
this works on SMP as well, as we can pin interrupts on CPUs.
