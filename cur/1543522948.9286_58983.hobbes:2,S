Sorry but I will never agree with your patch. The GFP_KERNEL change is not
something for 2.2.x. We have major deadlocks in getblk for example and you
may trigger tham more easily forbidding GFP_MID allocations to succeed. I
don't really see why you do these changes. What problem do you had on your
machine related to that? Such change sure won't help atomic allocations. Your
change only make a difference if we are oom.
Also killing the low_on_memory will harm performance. You doesn't seems to
see what such bit (that should be a per-process thing) is good for.
And the 1-second polling loop has to be killed since it make no sense.

Yes, using freepages.low is way better than my original freepages.high. I
noticed that this night after posting the patch. Anyway it's a
performance-only issue (see my other email) where I am providing an
incremental patch and a new version of my patch.
