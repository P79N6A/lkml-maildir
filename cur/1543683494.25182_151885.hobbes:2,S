make dep is obsolete in 2.6

When reconfiguring a 2.4 kernel it is adviced to do a:
cp .config ..
make mrproper
cp ../.config .
make oldconfig
make dep
etc.
For 2.6 you can just run make, without cleaning up before.
To get a resonable small configuration you can start out with
"make allnoconfig", which compiles ok in 2.6 for now.

This is a good place - you can also try kernelnewbies.
