tmpfs on Solaris lives just in virtual memory; if you'd installed Solaris
only on tmpfs, you'd have to do so on each reboot. Not really useful, is
it ;-)

"Frequently"? Happens roughly as often as with Solaris, in my experience.
But the machines I have at hand have different workloads, so my experience
might not count much. OTOH, my SS4 here is now Linux (was Solaris 2.5.1),
and I see _less_ frequency of hand intervention on boot now...

But they would swap over the net, with the same (or worse) end result.

That _do_ store your data permanently. It's just part of the cost you pay
for persistent data.
PS: Nice troll, not overdone.
