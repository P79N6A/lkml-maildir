Actually, my fix has been tested extensively, and m68k's won't crash when
accessing 4-bytes words on only 2-byte aligned addresses.  If you mean
that I moved the packet in the wrong direction to get the best alignment,
this can easily be fixed.

Do you mean that ip_rcv may not assume that packets are properly aligned ?
And some non-mmu m68k (Coldfires) do not provide enough information in
exception frames to restart instructions on an address error in the general
case.
