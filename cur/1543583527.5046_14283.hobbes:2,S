Under redhat 7 you should use kgcc to compile the kernel, since gcc2.96 is
inherently broken(*).

(*)  redhat chose to ship an experimental compiler with this release of
     the distribution that has a great many bugs. to ensure proper kernel
     compillation another proven version of gcc was included, but called
     kgcc instead. You should always use this to compile your kernels
     under redhat 7 until the newer version of gcc is released.
talk to you later,
