well, this is only an -rt artifact: the SLOB needs zero modifications to 
work on PREEMPT_RT, while SLAB needed a risky 66K monster patch. Until 
someone simplifies the SLAB conversion to PREEMPT_RT, i'll use the SLOB.
i havent noticed any significant slowdown due to the SLOB. In any case, 
we'll give it some workout which should further speed up its upstream 
integration - it's looking good so far.
