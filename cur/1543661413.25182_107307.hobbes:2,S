This works reasonably well for me, but it does require
MS-DOS fs support in the kernel, and having a /dev/fd0 entry
in /etc/fstab with "user" permissions (for some reason, "owner"
doesn't work).
I'd like to use my own recipe for "make bzdisk", to avoid these
restrictions. What about having "make bzdisk" optionally invoke
and external script, similarly to how "make install" works?

Indeed. Another reason is that gcc-3.2 generates (for me anyway)
much larger kernel images than gcc-2.95.3.
