	I believe we reduce the kernel size by 20kB, since we
previously included all of the partitioning systems so users do
not have to recompile the kernel.  So, even if we did not otherwise
use an initial ramdisk, and even if we were only concerned with the
size of a single copy of the kernel, moving the partitioning code
out of the kernel would still be a win.

	Per your request, I am correcting you.  There are more
significant advantages to having the partitioning code outside
of the kernel, which I described in my previous email:
| it would not have to be released with every new kernel, [...]
| it would be more flexible, and it could more easily share code
| with fdisk-like programs. 
	Basically, partition parsing is a small instance of a wider
phenomenon: there is a increasing variety of mechanisms that would
be useful for systems to use to mount their root partitions.  Examples
of this include diskless booting controlled by DHCP, encrypted root,
certain RAID roots, menu based selection of boot, smart card
authentication, and various combinations of the preceding.
Implementing most of these in the kernel is often:
		o duplicative of existing userspace facilities
		o less flexible to implement than in user space
		o harder to maintain than in user space (new version
		  with every kernel, no shared effort with other free
		  systems, etc.)
	By having a single modularized kernel with as little
code linked in as possible, we get the following advantages:
		o The same binary for the vast majority of systems,
		  with little memory wasted (this should improve further
		  as more intermediate layers functionality are also
		  modularized).
		o Less duplication of software maintenance and enhancement
		  for facilities such as DHCP client, partition table
		  parsing, etc.
		o Future: less fire fighting with each new kernel release
		  means that kernel developers can focus more on development.
	On the other hand, you are obviously free to run Linux any way
you want to.  I am not trying to stop you.
	I realize I am starting to wander into a general discussion
about software engineering strategy for the Linux kernel.  So, unless
there is some specific factual correction that I want to make, I
think I've expessed my point, and will probably let you (Russel) have
the last word now if you want.
