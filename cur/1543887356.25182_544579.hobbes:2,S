Hmmm... The #ifdef crap there has worried me for a long time. Lets try to 
clear that mess up too.

No I thought you had it under control so I held it in my tree.
Andrew please push this patch upstream.
SLUB: CONFIG_LARGE_ALLOCS must consider MAX_ORDER limit
Take MAX_ORDER into consideration when determing KMALLOC_SHIFT_HIGH.
Otherwise we may run into a situation where we attempt to create
general slabs larger than MAX_ORDER.
