for some research that i am working on, i am doing some experiments
with the linux kernel and some tcpip stuff in particular.  In any
case, in the tcp_rcv function, i have been able to get most of the
information that i need.  Now i need to modify the sequence number
of the packet and then recompute the checksum, but i am not sure
how to go about this.  I have expermimented for a while and turned
up nothing.
basically, i want to just modify the th->seq and then recompute
the tcp checksum and i suspect the skb checksum.
Is there an easy way to check the tcp checksum and then make the
mod and then recompute a new checksum.  any help is much appreciated.
for that matter, i will need to change fields in the tcp header in 
 the v_ip_queue_xmit function.  how can i compute whatever checksums
are neccessary here.
thanks,
- ayman
