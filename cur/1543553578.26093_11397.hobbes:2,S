Hi,
I wrote a daemon that fetches (as root-user) random numbers from the RNG in
the i82808 (found on 815-chipsets).
You can download it from 
http://www.vanheusden.com/Linux/random.php3
 .
Currently, I'm trying to rewrite things into a kernel-module so that one has
a standard character device which can deliver random values then.
Please give it a try as I do not own a PC with such a motherboard ;-/
