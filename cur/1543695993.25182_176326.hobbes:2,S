That would be the other piece that I'm currently missing regarding the ALi
M5819P on the TM5800.  On similar "buggy hardware" roughly eight months ago,
I got the mysterious chronometer jumps, although none seemed to go backwards
in time.  Whenever I watched it, it seemed normal, although when I left it
alone, the clock, on average, advanced only a few hours per day.  I saw
this problem persist up to 2.4.20, when I lost hope on that machine and
turned it into a FreeBSD workstation.  I do not currently remember whether
it had any ALi chipsets, and I never saw any weird messages, probably
because I never installed any Linux kernels after 2.4.20.  Maybe if I run
across any Knoppix CD's with recent kernels, I could test that machine
for the i8253 messages, but that is not likely at the moment.
