That's my concern as well. The advantage is that it simplifies
kmemleak but I can't tell how good the detection would be. I can add
some code to the current implementation to show how many values (32
bit aligned) found during scanning look like valid pointers (i.e.
PAGE_OFFSET < x < PAGE_OFFSET + ram_size) but cannot be found in the
radix_tree. It might not be that bad (I'll post tomorrow some
statistics).

Do you mean that when scanning it should only consider at the pointer
members in a structure? I don't think this can be easily achieved
because of the amount of structures in the kernel. There are places
where a pointer is stored as a long. There is also no way in C to
quantify the type of an object (similar to "typeid" in C++). The
closest approximation I could get was the size.
