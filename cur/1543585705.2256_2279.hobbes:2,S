    no, not perfect, i very much agree. but in daily usage it reduces
    chance of OOM to close to 0.
No. How would you use it? Compute individual limits for
each process? One typically has a few very large processes
that may easily take most of memory, and lots of small processes.
With a low ulimit these large processes do not run.
With a large ulimit it does not help against OOM.
The job of accounting what is available belongs to the system,
not the user.
Note that ulimit does not limit the sum of your processes,
it limits each individual process.
