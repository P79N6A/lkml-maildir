This is a general protection violation. No user-mode program would
(should) ever use these instructions.
In principle, a user-mode program should not even be able to do
this:
int
main ()
{
	register unsigned long eax asm("%eax");
	asm ("movl %ebx, %eax\n");
        printf("%08lX\n", eax);
	return 0;
}
... reading the value from an uninitialized register. But you can.
The CPU can't protect everything. This came up in a discussion about
having the kernel zero, or predefine, general purpose registers upon
process creation. The problem(s) being screwing up fork(), et al.
If you want to mess with priv level 0 stuff, make a module.
Cheers,
