Hrm, some basic testing shows me that, on x86_64:
        register long var, var2, var3, var4, var5;
        asm ("movq $0xFFFFFFFF,%0;\n\t" : "=r" (var) :);
        asm ("movq $0x100000000,%0;\n\t" : "=r" (var2) :);
        asm ("movq $0,%0;\n\t" : "=r" (var3) :);
        asm ("movq $0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF,%0;\n\t" : "=r" (var4) :);
        asm ("movq $0xFEFEFEFE01010101,%0;\n\t" : "=r" (var5) :);
generates:
  ae:   48 be ff ff ff ff 00    mov    $0xffffffff,%rsi
  b5:   00 00 00 
  b8:   48 bf 00 00 00 00 01    mov    $0x100000000,%rdi
  bf:   00 00 00 
  c2:   48 c7 c1 00 00 00 00    mov    $0x0,%rcx
  c9:   48 c7 c2 ff ff ff ff    mov    $0xffffffffffffffff,%rdx
  d0:   48 b8 01 01 01 01 fe    mov    $0xfefefefe01010101,%rax
  d7:   fe fe fe 
So we have to deal with the fact that gas produces opcodes of
different size (2 and 3 bytes) and with different immediate value sizes
for 8 bytes load immediates, depending on the immediate value to load.
There even seems to be an implicit duplication of the value when the
lower and higher 32 bits of the immediate value are the same (the
0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF case).
Therefore, I propose the following. We should use the
asm ("movq $0xFEFEFEFE01010101,%0;\n\t" : "=r" (var5) :);
to make sure we always deal with the same instruction and have a 8 bytes
immediate value. We don't really care about the static value given
because we always update it dynamically before the first time it is
executed.

Will fix. I noticed that it was because I had too much "register" char
variables declared and used at the same time. Putting a "g" constraint
gave the same result.
