"man test" shows that only "=" works ... that's for string equality,
which is what's being tested there.  And "==" is undefined (error).
If "==" were to kick in that would be for an arithmetic expression;
but "[" is (modulo wierdness) "test" not "expr".

My $SHELL is /bin/bash:
$ bash --version
GNU bash, version 3.2.13(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

I don't know how you managed to get it to work wtih "==".
String equality should be "=" in all /bin/sh versions.
It's been that way since it was written in pseudo-Algol.
