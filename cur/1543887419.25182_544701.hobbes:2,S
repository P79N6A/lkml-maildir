The original poster is quite unclear about how he wants to access the
serial port. Given that he uses "in user space known as", I deducted
he means kernel space. Then of course is the big question since there
are a number of ways:
  - access by filp
  - access by ldisc
  - access by <whatever drives console=ttyS0> (printk and something)
  - access by inb (perhaps it is a serial port with a custom chip
    that the OP wanted to write a driver for?)
Unfortunately, my magic sphere is out of order, so I could only take
a really really vague guess at what was wanted.

This is how 8250.c works.
