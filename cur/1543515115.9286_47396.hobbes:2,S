Something I'd like to see is that request_irq() return an ID (in fact
a pointer to the struct irqaction) that can be used by drivers to free
the IRQ. This would eliminate the search (not a big deal, considering
that each IRQ isn't likely to have lots of drivers on it), and would
look cleaner.
We could use such a change to fix the problem Rogier mentioned: change
free_irq() to take struct irqaction *. It's a bit harsh, as all
drivers would need to be modified, but it would ensure the problem
would be fixed once and for all. The less intrusive option would be to
create free_irqentry() and encourage driver maintainers to upgrade.
What do people think of this idea? If people like it, I might even be
persuaded to do some of the leg-work.
