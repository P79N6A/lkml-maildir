If that's the problem, create a minimal input driver that will signal the
snd-pcsp to beep, and change the original pcspkr to include "(Non-ALSA)".
Obviously both drivers will exclude each other, but that should be fine,
and users who prefer "music" over beeps will be fine, too.
And as a bonus, you might upload a custom PC beep ... but if you do, a
userspace notifyer combined with a beep-daemon might be preferable
(uinput? I know it exists ...).
Off cause I might be suggesting exactly what you did, since I didn't see
the patch.
