I have set up a CVS tree for this purpose on www.nl.linux.org,
people wanting to help can apply for an account by mailing me.
The manual for this CVS tree can be found at:
	
http://www.nl.linux.org/~riel/CVS/CVS-linuxperf.txt
Now all I can do is hope for a whole group of volunteers who
are in it for the linuxperf tree and an e-mail alias @nl.linux.org
(yes, I've got something extra to offer for the linux-perf folks).
