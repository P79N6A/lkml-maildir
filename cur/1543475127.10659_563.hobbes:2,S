I don't think (as the original author) patch-kernel should be modified
for application of non-Linus patches.  This just adds to the chances
of the naive user getting themselves into trouble (for example, the -ac
patches need reversing before application, a hot fix from Tytso or test
patch posted by Linus to linux-kernel needs reversing before applying
the proper patch, etc).
I see patch-kernel as a safe way for non-expert users to upgrade a
vanilla Linus tree, saving the need to pull across the whole tree on
each revision.  Anything more complicated than that, and I feel you are
in the realms of expert users, who should know what they are doing when
dealing with non-Linus patches.
I have already posted a modified patch-kernel to deal with the
2.2.0-preX patch series, but again, I don't think this should be part
of the distributed source -- it becomes obsolete as soon as 2.2.0 hits
the streets.
