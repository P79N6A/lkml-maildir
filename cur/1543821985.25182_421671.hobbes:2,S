"device class and/or IDs ... can contain garbage".  That seems to  
violate PCI spec to me.

Jon Smirl gave a great description of exactly how to write such a  
"driver".  I seem to recall that we already have the ability to  
trigger manual PCI binding by bus:slot number; in combination with an  
appropriate "write EEPROM with firmware file" driver that has no  
default list of PCI devices; you could easily manually trigger a bind  
of the device.  On the other hand I would personally never put such a  
device in my system, what if the garbage device IDs happened to match  
a device with poorly-written PCI IDE drivers that panic when they  
bind to a device which does not match their expectations?  In any  
case what you really need for all those cases is a simplistic stub  
driver that provides some sort of in-kernel mutual exclusion.
