I was very careful to say "pure mathematics". With perfect optimisation
all implementations of the same algorithm should produce the same parse
tree.
I can think of lots of trivial counter examples. The most obvious of
which is that given any set beginning pascal type homework the parse
tree of all the implementations with the noise/comments/names filtered
out is probably going to be identical.
The same exercise on library implementations of qsort, strcmp and so
forth are probably also going to show that.
