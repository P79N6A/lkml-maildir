The point is that kernel doesn't need to keep watching the memory space
every time a process needs memory. Only when memory is close this red zone.

You could see in another way. Release the kernel from calculating rating
so that better approaches of choosing the culprit can be proposed and
tested withoud mess too much the code.

If you stick on this thought, then there is more to say, but rather send test
results soon so that you all can evaluate.
