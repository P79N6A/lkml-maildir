Well, my original implementation carefully found the signature section,
copied it out and zeroed it, then checked the whole module.  The two
objections David Howells had was (1) stripping the module after build
breaks this, and (2) his scheme uses straight GPG signatures and they
are of variable length: some wrapper would be needed to handle trailing
zeroes in the signature.
The advantage was the simplicity of the scheme: very short path the
module verification, and no canonicalization step.
