    This patch seems to be slightly mangled; patch complains if
fs/dquot.c.orig already exists, though it doesn't seem to create such
a file in either case.

    I had to back these two patches out to build for ppc:
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
arch/ppc/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x32a2): In function `execve':
arch/ppc/kernel/entry.S: undefined reference to `errno'
arch/ppc/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x32a6):arch/ppc/kernel/entry.S:
undefined reference to `errno'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
    Probably just another reason to drop them.  I think I'm about to
find out if I should have backed out the syscall patch too. :)
