If it can, it should be escaped, perhaps similarly to how it's handled
in the HDLC protocol (itself an ISO standard) in byte mode: The flag
delimiter (SYNC) character is hex 7E and (if my memory's correct - I
don't have the standard to hand) any time the system wants to send
either 7E or 7D, it sends 7D followed by the relevant code XOR'd with
hex 40. As a result, 7E only actually occurs as a delimiter, and 7D
only occurs as an escape character for 7D or 7E, which appear as 3D or
3E respectively.
I could easily be wrong about the escape character used, but the
method is correct.

HDLC does not use a length field, but does have the procedure above to
ensure unambiguous detection of both start and end of field.

Alternatively, see if the protocol says anything about an escape
method similar to the above.

Do the reception rules actually require the detection of the Syn Time
period, or is that just there to give the receiver time to settle
down?

Is the specification available on the web anywhere?

To be honest, it's probably not going to be available on ANY
multitasking system - especially not on Macrohard's LoseSleep 9x
offerings...
