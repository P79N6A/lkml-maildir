I haven't had time to look at this closely, but I question why you're
trying to prevent grok_partitions() from doing it's thing. There's
supposed to be a flag set for removable media which ensures media
revalidation on scanning the parent directory or looking up an entry.
I'd rather see that mechanism fixed.
