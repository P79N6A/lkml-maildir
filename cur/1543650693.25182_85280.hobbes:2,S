Not to stretch this point too long, but turning off inlined functions 'can'
make code bigger too. It usually doesn't.
I have no problem with the other suggestion that CONFIG_TINY specify a
template for a set of build options, but if CONFIG_TINY is used (either
as an option, or a template of options) -Os should always be preferred
over -O2. Whether the user can still override this or not is a different
issue from whether -Os should be preferred over -O2 when CONFIG_TINY is
specified.
Or specified more clearly: If the compiler optimization flag is configurable,
choosing CONFIG_TINY should default the optimization flag to -Os before it
defaults the optimization flag to -O2.
