NO.
The point about backwards compatibility is that things WORK.
There's no point in comparing things to how you _want_ them to work. The
only thing that matters for bckwards compatibility is how they work
_today_.
And your suggestion would break every single installation out there. Not 
"maybe a few".  Every single one.
(yeah, you could find some NFS-only setup that doesn't break. Big deal).
And backwards compatibility is extremely important.
