Faulty memory.  The kernel distributed on installation floppies is pretty
stable.  The only reason for a oops is a hardware fault.  I had the same
problem but the oops used to appear when the intalling of package starts.
Try to plug the memory into another machine and run something big, say,
recompile the kernel.
