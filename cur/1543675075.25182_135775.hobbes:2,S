Many warnings are for problems that were already present in 2.4 or for
using deprecated (IOW: working) functions. It might be a thought to
probably disable deprecated warnings for stable kernel releases (read
2.6.0, 2.6.1,...) but it's not always a measurement for how far away we
are from 2.6. And besides, a full build of 2.4.20 with gcc 2.95 gives
you 103 warnings.

IMHO compiling and non-working (or worse: working but data-corrupting) 
is worse than non-compiling. It might be a good idea to let broken 
drivers depend on an (undefined) CONFIG_BROKEN, but this is only a minor 
detail with no influence on the 2.6 schedule.
