Hi guys,
just thought I'd share my experience of last several days.
Had to change the external nic on the gateway box from standard pci device, to a 
usb nic. turned the machine on, everything goes as planned, but no ipsec tunnels 
go up.
Spent couple of days solving the f*^&king problem, tried different kernels 
(2.6.9-2.6.11) and ipsec-tools versions, thought I was going mental.
Only to to find out that my USB Netgear FA-120 would not "work with ipsec".
for some reason, kernel can no create SAs.
Even if you set the tunnels manually, it is still a no go.
The logs are full of:
2005-03-07 15:17:20: ERROR: phase2 negotiation failed due to time up waiting for 
phase1. ESP xxx.xxx.xxx.bbb->xxx.xxx.xxx.aaa
2005-03-07 15:17:20: INFO: delete phase 2 handler.
2005-03-07 15:17:24: ERROR: can't start the quick mode, there is no valid 
ISAKMP-SA, 530bc0362f36f1ed:9673792c0daa890f
Anyone has any suggestions of why this was happening?
I can post more info if developers are interested.
