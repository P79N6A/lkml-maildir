ok, you can stop searching now.
A friend let me try his 3c575 cardbus card and everything works like a charm.
So the problem is really due to the Xircom CBE2-100 (card or tulip driver).
I've activated lots of debug (by redefining NETDEBUG in sock.h) so I'll see and
give more info when I have.
I won't put the logs on my site since they don't seem necessary from now, but
if someone wants them I can send him.

a bug ... perhaps, but surely not in the TCP/IP stack...
more info later.
