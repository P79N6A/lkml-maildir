Okay. I'll fix that.

I found it..........
module_exit() is just a wrapper around cleanup_module().
cleanup_module() gets called. I could rename cleanup_module to
foo() and then  use module_exit(foo);, which seems obtuse
since this has to compile on 2.4.x also, clearly not the
right thing to do.
`dmesg` clearly shown that the exit routine was called....
