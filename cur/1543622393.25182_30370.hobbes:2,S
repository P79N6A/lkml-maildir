Alan, wake up!
I'm talking about anonymous semaphores, the kernel implementation can just 
map a normal anonymous page there.
On 99.9% of all machines out there, you can have semaphores in perfectly 
normal memory.

Why are you talking about shared mappings?
The most common case for any fast semaphores are for _threaded_
applications. No shared memory, no nothing.
