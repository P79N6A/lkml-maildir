At this point, I am just using a working prototype to gauge the interest
in an improved interface. Other than that, I agree. This would be one
of the "speed optimizations I haven't tried".

It just means that not all the pieces that would be required to make
this a merge candidate have been implemented. I focused on the basic
infrastructure that is needed for the basic protocol.
Adding some access control that is about as smart as file permissions
in /proc is fairly easy (we have the caller pid and netlink_skb_parms
as a starting point). We only have read permissions to care about. It's
trivial to flag each field as "world readable", "owner only" (for fields
with process scope), and "root only". That covers pretty much what
/proc permissions achieve. While I am confident that this will work,
others may have better ideas for access control.
