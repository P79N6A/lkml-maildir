Subject: [PATCH] Make help text work again for string/int/hex
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/9/25/100

conf_askvalue calls fgets() which puts "?\n" in the buffer, not "?".
So testing the second char for '\0' fails every time.  You need to
check for \n instead, I think.
(whitespace damaged patch, it's a trivial change to make)
