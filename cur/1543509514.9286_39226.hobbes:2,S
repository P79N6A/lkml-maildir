Hello,
I'm having troubles when using the 2.2.12- 6.20 hydra ide-patch
Currenty, I'm using an Asus P2B, BIOS revision 1009, with on the onboard
controller a Maxtor 91000D8 hd as Primary master, a Seagate ST36531A hd
as primary slave, a Philips PCDV632
DVD-player as secundary master and a Iomega ATA-pi ZIP drive as
secondary slave.
On the Promise PDC20262 udma66 controller I have a Maxtor 91360U4
(UDMA/66) as tertiary
stand-alone. I've passed "ide2=ATA66 ide3=ATA66" to the 2.2.12 kernel
and I haven't installed
any other patches... Now when I try to play audio with my DVD player
(which is connected
digitaly to my SB Live! Value), after a few songs on a random audio cd
(using kscd 1.2.5 from SuSE 6.1 standard), it stops playing and starts
the cd from the beginning. In the kernel message console
I see something about an ATA-pi reset. After this thing repeats a few
times, the red IO led
stays on all the time and the system is hardly able to read/write
from/to the hd's on the onboard controller and the cd also doesn't react
anymore, not even the Eject button..
In the kernel message console I see a few repeated messages saying an
ATA-pi reset failed...
After disconnecting the power-cable on the DVD player and reconnecting
it, everything works again...
Here are the commands that are executed by hdparm in boot.local:
hdparm -d 1 -m 16 -a 16 -u 1 -c 1 -A 1 -W 1 -k 1 -K 1 /dev/hda
hdparm -d 1 -m 32 -a 32 -u 1 -c 1 -A 1 -W 1 -k 1 /dev/hdb
hdparm -d 1 -m 16 -u 1 -c 1 -A 1 -W 1 -k 1 -K 1 /dev/hde
hdparm -d 0 /dev/hdc
/dev/hda = Maxtor 91000D8, /dev/hdb = Seagate ST36531A, /dev/hdc =
Philips DVD player,
/dev/hde = Maxtor 91360U4
What can I do to get (digital) audio to work correctly on the DVD
player?
