It is relatively cheap on the PC, that doesn't mean it is cheap on all
architectures.

3c509 is ISA which doesn't support shared interrupts. disable_irq
stinks on shared interrupt devices.
As a rule of thumb it is much better to disable the interrupt at the
real source, ie. the device, if possible.
