The crappy little controllers are mostly supported nowdays. They are
often IRQless and they are 8bit ISA pio. I put mine back on the crap controller
because it only wanted to work at 5Mhz. it didnt do disconnect and it
generally made my scsi subsystem behave like a macII. 
The older one had some problems with lockups but with current 2.2 kernels
its slow, its crap but it has minimal usability impact on  the machine.
