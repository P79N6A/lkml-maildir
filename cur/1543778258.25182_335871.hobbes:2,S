Hi,
at the moment I am packaging a Linux module as an RPM archive.
Therefor I would like to remove some of the not exported/needed
symbols (like e.g. static functions or constants) from the
Linux module.
What is the best way to do this with v2.6.
I have tried e.g. to remove all symbols starting with "telos"
from the module like this (after kbuild):
  strip -w -K '!telos*' -K 'telosi2c_usb_driver' telosi2c_linux.ko
When I try to load such a module, insmod dies with a segmentation
fault or the complete kernel dies (with "invalid operand: 0000").
What is the reason for this problem?
What is the correct way using kbuild to remove some symbols?
cu, Marco
