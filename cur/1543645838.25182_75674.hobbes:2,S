Have you enabled USB Keyboard Support in your BIOS?

The scancodes have changed.  Try adding keycode 336 = XF86AudioMedia and
keycode 288 = XF86Refresh.  If that works then remove any others you have
problems with, press the buttons to see the unknown scancode reported as
above to find out what it is, then add it back correctly with the new
code.
