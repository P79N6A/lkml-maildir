We've had HUGE problems with 2.4.x kernels and VIA based boards. We have
here 3 VIA boards with Athlon/850 and Duron/900 CPUs. The problem goes
like this:
Compile 2.4.3 with VIA and Athlon support.
Reboot.
Ooopses (between 1 and continuously scrolling of them) occur at random
periods of time, between mounting the root filesystem and 2-3 minutes of
functionality.
Note that the problem occurs with all versions of 2.4 but not with
2.2.17-2.2.19. Also, enabling or disabling DMA doesn't help fix the
problem.
After several compiles, it appears that compiling with 586 cpu support
instead of Athlon resulted in a working, stable kernel (which is rather
strange imo, given there are different CPUs but the same board model).
However, compiling with 386 support didn't (which was my first guess of a
stable system).
I was a bit lazy and didn't save/ksymoops any of the oopses, but will do
if this is not a well-known problem (and it appears that more or less it
is).

I know that all in all this is rather irrelevant, but if further
