I can see how it would help with (2), as that prompty tells the firmware to
issue its default ACPI events for Fn+F4 upon removal.  But I have *NO* idea
what thinkpad_acpi might be doing that is causing issues with the wake up
after a resume.
Please open a bug in bugzilla.kernel.org about it, and attach the full debug
output of a suspend+resume cycle with and without thinkpad-acpi loaded.
Also, please try the same with thinkpad-acpi loaded, but
CONFIG_THINKPAD_ACPI_INPUT_ENABLED set to N.  If the problem goes away,
please retest, but set hotkey_enable to 1 and do an "cat
/sys/bus/platform/devices/thinkpad_acpi/hotkey_recommended_mask >
/sys/bus/platform/devices/thinkpad_acpi/hotkey_mask" before the sleep.
You will probably need to enable a bunch of debug options in ACPI and
thinkpad-acpi to get good enough logs.  It is probably worth posting the
acpid logs too: the real difference might be there.
