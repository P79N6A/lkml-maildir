Your patch leaves a race condition open. And no, I don't have a stripped
down patch. It's impossible for me to syncronize layers of linux1394
development with the timing of 2.4/2.5 development. The size of the
current 2.4 diff is only because of the amount of stuff merged from our
2.5 tree and a serious code cleanup (fixing locking problems like you saw
here).
Fixing your particular locking problem required removal of some shared
data, which required an additional API in the lowlevel subsystem. It's
not trivial to extrapolate just this from the patch.
