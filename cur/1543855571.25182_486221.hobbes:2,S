Hi,
  I have a looong time opened a bugreport on XFS at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7287
 and I see it still
appear in my kernel output during bootup. I guess this is one of the
relatively new kernel self-testing features introduced recently. I
just wanted to let you know about that.
=============================================
[ INFO: possible recursive locking detected ]
2.6.19-rc6-git10 #1
---------------------------------------------
mount/3439 is trying to acquire lock:
 (&(&ip->i_lock)->mr_lock){----}, at: [<c11136fc>] xfs_ilock+0x4a/0x68
but task is already holding lock:
 (&(&ip->i_lock)->mr_lock){----}, at: [<c11136fc>] xfs_ilock+0x4a/0x68
other info that might help us debug this:
2 locks held by mount/3439:
 #0:  (&inode->i_mutex){--..}, at: [<c12f138d>] mutex_lock+0x8/0xa
 #1:  (&(&ip->i_lock)->mr_lock){----}, at: [<c11136fc>]
