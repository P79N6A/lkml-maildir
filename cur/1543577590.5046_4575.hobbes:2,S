I initially added only the two quantum drives to the pdc_quirk_list,
and that had no effect, the machine still hung on boot up at the same
place.  After this, I added the other two Maxtor's as well, and with
all four drives in the pdc_quirk_list, the system booted up fine.
Should I narrow this down further?  Will it be detrimental in any way
to have all four drives listed in the quirks table if they needn't be?

and hdparm yields about 25Mbit/s.
I'm trying to get the runtime system to hang like it did before as
well...  I'm running "dd if=/dev/hdX of=/dev/null &" on all four
drives simultaneously, and about 3 times per drive to hit the
controller and disk I/O system really hard.  So far, it's all been
fine.  Hopefully that means that the problems gone away. :)
Thanks for the help!
