Yeah, I noticed that too, thanks for verifying this: during the 2nd bisect 
run, the box locked up hard when I accessed the device-mapper. I'm using a 
wrapper script to set up my luks/dm-crypt devices and still have to find 
out which command exactly triggers the lockup. So, maybe the hard lockup 
and the hangs are not so unrelated after all...oh well.

Thanks for your assistance, David, I really appreciate it. I'll try to 
find out more about this dm-crypt thingy....
