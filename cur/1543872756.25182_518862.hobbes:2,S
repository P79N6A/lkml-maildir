Subject: [PATCH] [RSDL] sched: rsdl accounting fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/11/200

Andrew the following patch can be rolled into the
sched-implement-rsdl-cpu-scheduler.patch file or added separately if
that's easier. All the oopses and bitmap errors of previous versions of rsdl
were fixed by v0.29 so I think RSDL is ready for another round in -mm.
Thanks.

Higher priority tasks should always preempt lower priority tasks if they
are queued higher than their static priority as non-rt tasks. Fix it.
The deadline mechanism can be triggered before tasks' quota ever gets added
to the runqueue priority level's quota. Add 1 to the quota in anticipation
of this.
The deadline mechanism should only be triggered if the quota is overrun
instead of as soon as the quota is expired allowing some aliasing errors in
scheduler_tick accounting. Fix that
