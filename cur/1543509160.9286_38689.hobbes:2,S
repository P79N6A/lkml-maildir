I'll patch a rtl configed kernel. The idea is that if you selectrtl_config you 
get calls via the patch table and if you then insert the rtl module 
the patch is made. If you don't want the possibility of rtl you get
inlined cli/sti . Note that on other architectures there is not even
a bloat price since we don't have 8bit cli/sti instructions.

My feeling is that the cost is undetectable and that if you don't want
rtl you run standard code, if you do want, you run a jump table that
allows rtl to be turned on and off. 
But I do like the idea of a section, I just don't know how to do it 
wouldnt it compile out to similar code ?
