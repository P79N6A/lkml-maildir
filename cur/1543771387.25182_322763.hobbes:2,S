I'll be available for testing...
One more data point: I just checked 2.4.31 and it behaves the same.
I also tried checking Windows (98SE) but that may not have been too 
useful. It shows no difference in disk throughput with or without the 
USB2 HDD switched on, but it's only giving me 28 MB/s anyway (on C:, 
which is a 4G VFAT partition right at the end of the disk; the slowest 
part) which might not be enough to notice a misbehaving EHCI controller. 
Also tried giving it a D: partition at the start of the disk, but the 
blasted thing only gave me 16 MB/s there...
Rene.
