Follow-up: in the mean time I upgraded to test13-pre3. Things look fine so
far, but I got this in the kernel log:
TCP: peer 203.65.190.178:25/57885 shrinks window 2375104836:0:2375106284. Bad, what else can I say?                                                                                                 
Should I be worried about it or it's ok ?
