I'd prefer it if we just remove those two tests from fs without
adding one into set_page_dirty at all; though I've not tested
that recently (replying before remembering the easiest way to
do so), and others may disagree.
The real reason for those tests was that pre-2.6.16 a compound page
stored its destructor in page[1].mapping: which went badly wrong if
that constituent page ever ended up being passed to set_page_dirty.
I moved it somewhere safer in 41d78ba55037468e6c86c53e3076d1a74841de39
but didn't have the courage to remove those tests you're now removing:
the earlier we skip out from that case, the more efficiently it's
handled, I didn't want to slow those paths down in case they were
important to someone.
So I'd be glad to see those tests now gone without replacement.
