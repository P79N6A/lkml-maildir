yeah. you're right. I see no way to make it backward-compatible. in fact,
I haven't think much about name. probably you're right again and this
"ext3 on steroids" should have another name.
 MM> Similar questions here.
no. this one is backward-compatible and usual ext3 will run ok.
btw, I think it possible to implement few routines that could allow
to exploit delayed allocation and multiblock allocator patches w/o
introducing extents. the most visible effect of the extents is much
faster truncate.

yep. thanks for notice.
