I agree.
Something that occurs to me - if a machine has non hot-swap capable
IDE hardware, but has suspend to RAM functionality, presumably it is
OK from an electronic viewpoint to swap disks?  What about PCI hot
swap?  Presumably we can remove a non hot-swap IDE controller
completely, and re-install it with different drives connected?
In other words, perhaps IDE hot swap capable equipment is not
completely a pre-requisite to make use of IDE hot swap from the kernel
point of view.
John.
