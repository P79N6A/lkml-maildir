Bottom line: Larry's idea can be implemented today (and it already is
implemented in the Cobalt NasRaq, for example).
If you want to do it cheaper than Cobalt and you want it NOW, go for the
"mini PC". If you want to do it even cheaper, have some time to do some
development, and want to do a big run, go for an embedded CPU solution.
