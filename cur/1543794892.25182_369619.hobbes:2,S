Tru64 adds a "st_gen" field to struct stat.  It is an unsigned int that
is a "generation" counter for a particular inode.  To get a collision
while creating and removing files, you'd have to remove and create a
file with the same inode 2^32 times while tar (or whatever) is running.
Here's what stat(2) says:
  Two structure members in <sys/stat.h> uniquely identify a file in a file
  system: st_ino, the file serial number, and st_dev, the device id for the
  directory that contains the file.
  [Tru64 UNIX]  However, in the rare case when a user application has been
  deleting open files, and a file serial number is reused, a third structure
  member in <sys/stat.h>, the file generation number, is needed to uniquely
  identify a file. This member, st_gen, is used in addition to st_ino and
  st_dev.

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
