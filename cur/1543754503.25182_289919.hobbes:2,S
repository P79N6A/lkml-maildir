I don't think Anton can count.  (and for some reason I seem to be missing
his mail at the moment.)
include/asm-arm/pgtable.h:#define FIRST_USER_PGD_NR     1
there's two.  FIRST_USER_PGD_NR was created specifically for ARM because
many of our CPUs place their hardware vector tables at *virtual* address
zero.  Unmapping this virtual page would be rather bad for the system -
consider the effect of unmapping the code for *all* CPU exceptions.
