Doubtful.  mmci_stop_data() already does this, which will be called
immediately prior to mmci_request_end().  So you're doubling up the
writes to registers again.
Since this is not the first occurance that you've had to do this with
your board (the other being the SIC) I suggest that your board is
faulty in some way, causing writes to registers to be occasionally
dropped.
