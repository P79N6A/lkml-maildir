Why isn't dynamic priority just an extension of static priority?  Why do 
you modify only the ordering while leaving the timeslice alone?
So, tell me if I infer this correctly:  If you have a nice 5 and a nice 
7, but the nice 5 is a cpu hog, while the nice 7 is interactive, then 
the interactivity scheduler can modify their dynamic priorities so that 
the nice 7 is being run before the nice 5.  However, despite that, the 
nice 7 still gets a shorter timeslice than tha nice 5.
Have you tried altering this?
