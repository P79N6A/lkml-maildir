> [PATCH v3 2.6.29] cxgb3 - manage private iSCSI IP address
> 
> The accelerated iSCSI traffic could use a private IP address unknown to the OS:
> - The IP address is required in both drivers to manage ARP requests and connection set up.
> - Added an control call to retrieve the ip address.
> - Reply to ARP requests dedicated to the private IP address.
