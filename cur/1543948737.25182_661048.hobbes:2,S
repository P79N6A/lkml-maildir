Thanks, please ack this patch unless you have any objections.
I tested this patch with Jiri's test-case, seems to work.
The Roland's review is still needed ;)

[PATCH] handle_stop_signal: don't wake up the stopped task until it sees SIGCONT
The bug was found by Jiri Kosina <jkosina@suse.cz>, and the patch is based
on his ideas.
handle_stop_signal(SIGCONT) wakes up the stopped task and unlocks ->siglock
for do_notify_parent_cldstop(p, CLD_CONTINUED). The woken task returns from
do_signal_stop(), takes ->siglock and resumes to user-space without actually
seeing SIGCONT which may have a handler.
Move the code realated to do_notify_parent_cldstop(CLD_CONTINUED) up, before
"wake_up_state(t, state)".
NOTE: It is possible that the subsequent rm_from_queue(SIG_KERNEL_STOP_MASK)
removes SIGSTOP which comes after SIGCONT when we drop ->siglock. Not nice,
but possible even without this change. Hopefully we can remove the parent
notifying code from the sender path completely, but this needs more thinking.
