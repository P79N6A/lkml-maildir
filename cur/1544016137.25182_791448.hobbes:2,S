IBM is not working on OSD for a long time now. We at open-osd are.
That is me and Benny (abit) and other people that hang on the mailing-list
So it is mostly Panasas these days.
On git.open-osd.org we are hosting various OSD projects mainly the submitted

One of the projects on open-osd.org is the OSC's osd-target which is based
