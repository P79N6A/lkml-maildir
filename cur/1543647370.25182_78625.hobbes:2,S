I assume the stall is not 'while pages are sent to disk', but rather
until kswapd gets around to freeing enough pages to allow memory to
fill again. The stall is due to the pages being fully analyzed to
determine which ones should go, and which ones shouldn't. O_STREAMING
removes the pages ahead of time, so no analysis is ever required.
