Neither arch I care about (ppc, x86) needs to do anything with PROT_SEM, so it's
OK.  glibc will have to be fixed on any architectures which require help here,
and a hook will be needed somewhere in the kernel for them.
I didn't implement it because I don't *know* which archs will need something,
and what they will need.  Hence my request for arch maintainers to step
forward (Linus said they exist, and I believe him).
Hope that clarifies this particular wart...
Rusty.
