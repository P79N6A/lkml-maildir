Fact is, we have a capability enabled system for quite some time. It's
just not making any progress regarding fs caps. But I must admit, that
it may not be the time to include them into the mainstream kernel. On
the other hand, if there were an implementation from someone Linus
trusts, I'm sure he won't hesitate to include it right away.
BTW, it's really amazing how many people argue _against_ and how few
are working _for_ fs capabilities. And it's not that anybody has shown
real arguments against. Mostly uneasy fealings, eventual scenarios and
bashing of stupid vendors and foolish sysadmins. This might score some
points here and there, but it is not really helpful.
Anyway, have a nice time waiting. ;-)
Regards, Olaf.
