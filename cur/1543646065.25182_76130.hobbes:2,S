I have sent Neil Brown an email asking for his thoughts on a possible code
merge.
Neil is on vacation until 10/7.
I would say that the EMVS MD code & original MD code are very similar.
The most significant difference is the MD array discovery and setup code.
EVMS MD does in-kernel discovery, whereas Linux MD has both in-kernel
discovery (via fs/partitions/check.c) and user space initiated discovery
(IOCTL).
