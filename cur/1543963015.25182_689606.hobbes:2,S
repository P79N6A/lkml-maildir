There surely is documentation available covering this?
And why do we need this clear_cpu_cap(c, X86_FEATURE_PAT) and then 
manual setting of X86_FEATURE_PAT at all?
There's no indication in the code, and as Rene already says there's even
no description at all in commit 9307cacad0dfe3749f00303125c6f7f0523e5616
Such code really needs a comment explaining why we have to do this at all.
There must be some CPUs with the "pat" flag set but not being usable?
Which?
According to the linux-kernel discussions there might not be any broken 
CPU at all - but in this case the whitelist will not fill itself, and 
expecting people to note that their flags changed and complaining is not 
really a good approach.
And that your commit added the same clear/set code in three different 
places doesn't look good - this really deserved from the beginning being 
factored out into an own function to avoid future problems when CPUs get 
added (like what happens with your patch here - it touches only one 
place, and since the same context is present in two places in the same 
file "patch" might even choose freely where it gets applied...).
Pavel even made a similar comment on linux-kernel before the patch 
got merged into Linus' tree. [1]
Guys, even if it compiles in all randconfig configurations and works on 
all test machines this is exactly the kind of stuff that causes 
headaches in the future.
And this patch (by the author of the code himself) is the first time 
where it breaks.
