I've installed kernel 2.6.17-rc6 and activited the bcm43xx-driver for my
Broadcom-Chip in my notebook, also softmac, ...
The wlan-driver is loaded successfully, I can set all parameters and so
on.
I also installed wpa_supplicant without problems.
Authentication to my AP is not possible, the problem seems to be:
ioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Invalid argument
Driver did not support SIOCSIWENCODEEXT
WPA: Failed to set PTK to the driver.
So it seems that the bcm43xx-driver included in this kernel versions is
not ok - I cannot connect to my AP using WPA.
Any hints?
