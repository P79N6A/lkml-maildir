Hi
I have just had a look at the 2.3.24->30 kernels searching for whatever 
broke the mmap(2) system call and narrowed it down to 24->25 changes.
There are quite a lot of mm changes in there so I am still narrowing it 
down further.
To remind you, the symptom is that when you run binaries in PER_SVR4 or 
PER_UW7 personalities linked with more than just the interpreter 
(/usr/lib/libc.so.1) then the mmap(2)s made by interpreter to map texts 
of other libraries work incorrectly (i.e. file offset is wrong). The data 
is mapped correctly. Linux programs (PER_LINUX) strangely work fine but 
surely all programs should work fine under Linux, not just the native ones...
Regards,
Tigran.
