I have read the discussion on this issue and I wanted to get 
confirmation of my understanding...
Issue:
    It seems glibc is caching getpid() which is wrong and breaks 
programs like mine.
    You are using an older version of  glibc than I and that is why you 
could run the test program.
Given the above, that means that:
    Upgrading my kernel on the FedoraCore2 system won't help because the 
bug is in glibc
    Assuming that this is a "new" feature of glibc, any others upgrading 
would then starting seeing this bug
