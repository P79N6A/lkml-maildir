Isn't ide-io.c:ide_{start,complete}_power_step() enough?
BTW:
bugzilla bug #5604 - user is using 'ide-generic' host driver instead
of 'piix' so no wonder that suspend/resume doesn't work
bugzilla bug #2039 - is probably fixed by 2.6.12 (contains bugfix for
via82cxxx host driver not  bugfix for not restoring transfer mode)
"From Matthew Garrett  2005-03-30 17:17 UTC  [reply] -------
Linux currently has no real support for setting up IDE interfaces on resume.
Some machines are kind enough to set the IDE interface up themselves, but on
others we're doomed to failure. I'm looking into implementing this, but it won't
happen until some time after Hoary."
ide_{start,complete}_power_step() was there since the early 2.6.x days
