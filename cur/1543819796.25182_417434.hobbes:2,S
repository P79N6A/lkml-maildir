Can't speak to a list I haven't seen, but hard links are not
a problem.  Hard links can only be used within a volume.  Simply
place all your allowed executables on one partition/volume. 
Perhaps it is mounted read/only from a DVD or over an NFS share.
Hard links become a non problem if users can't write to the volume
that the files reside on.
