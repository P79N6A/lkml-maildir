As a followup to the thread regarding slabinfo and Andrew's 
earlier query about updating slabtop.
watch -n1 slabinfo -S 
seems to be a reasonable replacement for slabtop. The only
missing functionality are some hotkeys missing: you have to restart 
now to get a different sort order (and to read the slabinfo source
to find out the correct option), but other than that it works.
So I would propose to just retire slabtop and replace 
it with a simple shell script doing that.
A manpage for slabinfo would be useful though. Anybody 
volunteering to write one?
