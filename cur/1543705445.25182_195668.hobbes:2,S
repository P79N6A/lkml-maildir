Hi.
I managed to get subjects kernel to compile and run here pretty much 
without problems except:
kernel loaded the
<clip>
Feb  2 22:38:15 603ev kernel: de2104x PCI Ethernet driver v0.6 (Sep 1, 
2003)
</clip>
driver.
Driver tried to get address and other info on dhcpcd but failed 
eventually and got info from cache.
This is what I got from lspci:
00:0b.0 Host bridge: Apple Computer Inc. Bandit PowerPC host bridge (rev 
03)
00:0d.0 Ethernet controller: Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21041 
[Tulip Pass 3] (rev 21)
00:10.0 Class ff00: Apple Computer Inc. O'Hare I/O (rev 01)
00:11.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc 264VT [Mach64 
VT] (rev 40)
Sys is pmac 4400/200 running debian unstable.
I hope this could at least give some pointers to the people doing the 
good work
For more info/questions, return is valid and I'm on freenode on 
#debian-ppc if needed
