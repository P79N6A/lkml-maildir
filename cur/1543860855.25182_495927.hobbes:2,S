Hello,
I just read about the subjects.
I have a firewall which has some issues.
First it was a VIA CL6000 (c3).
Now it is a EK8000 (c3-2) with different power supply, RAM and board of
course. Still I see strange things sometimes. Crashes, hangs, etc. Now
and then. Not too often.
I have in .config:
CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=y
CONFIG_MVIAC3_2=y
Does this mean the issue applies to my own kernels?
Udo
