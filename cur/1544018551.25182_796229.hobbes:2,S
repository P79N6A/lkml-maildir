Yes, the problem is cpuset does not track the tasks which has allocated from 
this node - who has either moved or changed it set of allowable nodes. And 
because of that it does not limit oom killing to the tasks with in those tasks 
and could kill some innocent tasks at times.
As it is unable to take deterministic decision as memcg does, it plays with 
badness value and only suggests but does not restricts within those tasks that 
has to be killed.
This bug is present even without this patch.

The current cpuset oom handling has to be fixed and the exact problem of 
killing innocent processes exists even without the oom-controller.
