Did you enable APIC in UP mode, and did you try with an SMP kernel booted
with the 'nosmp' option ? Have you tried with plain 2.4.26 too ? There were
e1000 changes in latest bk.
I'm interested in trying this, because I know of a firewall appliance which
is based on a dell with 2 xeon HT and which has 2 of these cards. I might
try to boot it on a linux CD on monday if I find some time. Could you post
your config ?

Willy
