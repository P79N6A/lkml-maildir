This also suffices to cease the skipping:
	while true; do false; done;
I also see this, by the way:
	May 19 15:15:51 andromeda kernel: psmouse.c: Mouse at
	isa0060/serio1/input0 lost
	 synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.
	May 19 15:16:02 andromeda kernel: psmouse.c: Mouse at
	isa0060/serio1/input0 lost
	 synchronization, throwing 1 bytes away.
	May 19 15:16:03 andromeda kernel: psmouse.c: Mouse at
	isa0060/serio1/input0 lost
	 synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.
But these don't correlate with the skips, which frequently happen even
when there's no kernel log entry for the mouse.  FWIW, that could be a
legitimate hardware problem, though it happens even when I'm using an
external mouse (laptop).
