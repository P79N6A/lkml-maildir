  Basically you are describing a thin client kind of model. I like to 
create 
high end thin clients but I don't have any funding. Currently thin 
clients don't have the power to do multi-media as well as PCs. 
  I did everything so far with my own money and time. I don't think we 
need a supercomputer. Here is a idea but it would require a good amount 
of work. Create a X server that runs on one remote server and it programs 
the hardware remotely. Now that would save enormously. I started to work on 
this but didn't have time. Just some ideas to throw at you.
