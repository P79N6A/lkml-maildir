Right. Accepting any patch is wrong policy. You'll be swamped.
Patch must be marked "applies to 2.N.M", patch tracking system must check 
that automagically.
Also each patch(set) can be commented by general public and by maintainers.
If there is _no_ comment from any of _maintainers_ (i.e. it is not reviewed 
or found too ugly to worth commenting) it is automatically dropped from the 
system after some time.  This will force patch authors to care about code 
quality.
If patch is too old (several releases behind) system can mail author(s):
"Warning. Your patchset #3476346 needs rediffing. It will be dropped 
otherwise"
These "small" details determine whether system is useful or just turns into 
huge pile of patches of questionable value.
