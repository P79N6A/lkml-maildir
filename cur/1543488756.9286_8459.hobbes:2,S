Indeed. skb_queue_len is if anything going to be faster. In 2.0 skb_queue_len
was slow, in 2.2 its not - Andrea is right

On a ful receive queue you must still always process the ack and window
information then throw the frame. Its as simple as that. 
	State
	Ack
	Window
	if it fits
		Data
		Fin 
	end

By 64K ?

If your MTU is < 3 * the max window you propose to offer you should set the
MSS lower in the tcp connection options (TCP MSS blah). This also makes tcp
work better as well as solving your deadlock.
