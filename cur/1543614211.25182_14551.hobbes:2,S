Rob, you haven't looked at the actual changes I made, have you?
If you had, you'd realized that I have not introduced "kibibyte", 
or "mebibyte" or any of those terms anywhere.  The Configure.help
changes involve only the IEC-standard abbreviations KiB, MiB, and GiB.
Try criticizing what I actually did, as opposed to what you merely *assume* 
I did.  You'll be more convincing that way.
