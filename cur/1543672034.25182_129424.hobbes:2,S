So... we should check UnixWare to see if any of the Ext2 support is provided 
by GPL code ripped and distributed under the UnixWare license, which is 
presumably not compatible with the GPL?
I know that's what you meant, I just thought I'd spell it out.  To date, I've 
never had the slightest interest in UnixWare, but now I'm getting at least a 
little interested.  UnixWare includes Ext2 support?  The UnixWare license 
doesn't guarantee the user can have the source?
Regards,
Daniel
