Have been some work done already. Has there been any problems?

It is a fundamental difference between an integer and a boolean. Have 
you seen anyone trying to do "bool var = true + true;"? ;)

I don't think a boolean should be view as a single bit bitfield. Ex:
u8 a:1;
...
int b = 4 + a;
is obviously not a boolean, while:
u8 a:1;
...
if (a)
is, and a should be "bool a:1;" (imho)
