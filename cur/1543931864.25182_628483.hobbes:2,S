Sure, I'll go back through and see if the series can be cleaned up a bit
as well as expand the commit message a little bit.

Sorry, I should have predicated the whole series with RFC.  Currently
this is compile-tested only.  There is only the one patch that has
any behavioral change.  I believe the series also pointed out an
existing bug in the 32-bit version...which I've preserved but will
note in the commit messages in the respun series.
In case you're interested, from the patch which unifies the definition
of MAX_INSTRUCTION_SIZE:
memcpy(p->ainsn.insn, p->addr, (MAX_INSN_SIZE + 1) *
sizeof(kprobe_opcode_t));
If you compare this memcpy from arch_prepare_kprobe in 32/64 bit I'm
almost sure the X86_32 version should be
... + sizeof(kprobe_opcode_t)
not
... * sizeof(kprobe_opcode_t)
Cheers,
Harvey
