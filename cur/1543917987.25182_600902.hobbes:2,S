That cannot happen right now because cpu_disable() on both i386/x86-64
reject CPU #0. So just setting IRQ_NOBALANCING is sufficient and both
do that already. I was wrong earlier in being concerned about this.

That would not handle the case with a single CPU running only
irq  0 but not broadcasting I think.
I believe 
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/x86_64/quilt/patches/fix-watchdog
is the correct fix
