Why would this be a problem? I can renice jobs all the time on my home
system, which is a dual Celeron. And it isn't critical that the daemon
sets a priority before the newly spawned process runs.

Something like that. It may be worth adding a new task priority field to
the task_struct. For now I'm just thinking about "nice" values though.

Come again? The kernel patch is the enfocement. It kills tasks when the
system runs out of virtual memory, using policies set by the daemon.

If the system crashes, fix the problem, don't cover it up.

You're talking about preventing system-wide OOM using quotas. The ONLY way
to do that is to limit N users to 1/N of the system memory on average,
which effectively disables overcommit as a side effect.

If you have a fixed amount of hardware resources, an overcommitting system
with the OOM killer patch should always survive low memory situations.
User processes will be killed, but you would have done that much earlier
in a quota'd system.

You're not paying attention! The daemon doesn't handle OOM, that's what
the kernel patch does. The daemon just sets policy.

That's the motive for the userspace priority-setting daemon. The
daemon/OOM killer setup is actually far more flexible than memory quotas.
In fact, a form of memory quotas could be implemented with the daemon,
though you'd still need the kernel patch to handle extreme cases like a
fork bomb.

Which can always be the case, since X directly accesses hareware. And this
is the reason for priorities; if the sysadmin sets a fork bomb to have
high priority, he gets what he deserves. Root is allowed to kill the
system.
