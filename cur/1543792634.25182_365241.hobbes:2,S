Subject: [PATCH 20/39] NLKD/x86-64 - switch_to() floating point adjustment

Touching of the floating point state in a kernel debugger must be
NMI-safe, specifically math_state_restore() must be able to deal with
being called out of an NMI context. In order to do that reliably, the
context switch code must take care to not leave a window open where
the current task's TS_USEDFPU flag and CR0.TS could get out of sync.
