Now THAT I'll buy... It would certainly explain why some KT133A 
motherboards work and some don't, but the relation would be a little 
complex, the chipset might be exposing general problems with regulators 
used in motherboards.
Verifying this would require both extensive analysis of the motherboards 
and chipsets, and the regulators.
You'd also need to verify the manufacturing place, batch and time/date 
for at least 50 to 100 motherboards to begin verifying this.
