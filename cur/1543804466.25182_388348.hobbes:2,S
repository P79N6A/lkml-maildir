What sort of tests would you suggest? The tests I have been running to
date are
"kbuild + aim9" for regression testing
"updatedb + 7 -j1 kernel compiles + highorder allocation" for seeing how
easy it was to reclaim contiguous blocks
What tests could be run that would be representative of real-world
workloads?

List-based was frowned at for adding complexity to the main path so we may
not get list-based built on top of zone based even though it is certinatly
possible. One reason to do zone-based was to do a comparison between them
in terms of complexity. Hopefully, Nick Piggin (as the first big objector
to the list-based approach) will make some sort of comment on what he
thinks of zone-based in comparison to list-based.

Will set this up and post results after I post patches. The high-order
stress tests are already running updatedb which should have had a similar
effect. However, I never checked when updatedb finished so maybe it
finishes early in the test.
