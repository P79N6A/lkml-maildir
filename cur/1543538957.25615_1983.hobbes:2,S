Well, guess who is now trying to bring up 2.4 on a laptop :-(
The problem is that unreset_socket() is a timer handler.
unreset_socket ->
  cb_alloc ->
    pci_insert_device ->
      pci_announce_device ->
        vortex_probe1 ->
          init_etherdev ->
            init_netdev ->
              init_alloc_dev ->
                kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL) ->
                  <splat>
We don't want to create another kernel thread just for cardbus.
I think the best general way to fix this is for the timer handler to do
nothing but register a callback with something which is running in
process context, such as `swapper'.
Does a capability such as this exist at present?
