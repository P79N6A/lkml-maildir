Arguably, making neponset_probe __devinit and neponset_port_fns
__devinitdata is arguably more correct since any device driver can
be bound and unbound at any time (grumble).
I don't think David's platform_driver_probe() is a proper answer
since it's still possible to unbind the driver, leaving no way to
re-bind.  IOW, it only solves half the problem.  Really, the
allowance of bind/unbind should be a per-driver and per-bus thing
imho.  That's for a separate discussion though.
