Indeed. The NULL checks are redundant and thus need to go. If someone
can show a measurable performance regression in the kernel for a
realistic workload, kfree() can be turned into an inline function
which will take care of it. The microbenchmarks are fun but should not
stand in the way of merging the kfree() cleanups from Jesper and
others.
