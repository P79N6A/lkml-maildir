First of all, that is pcitweak. Reading all the register space
sequentially 32bit word-wise revealed the following:
If word #7 (counting from 0) is 0x22a0c0c0 the driver locks up while
loading, while with 0xa2a0c0c0 it will load. I'll try and reproduce the
case where I get the lockup-prone value, and then try to write the
working value there...
Later,
Chris
