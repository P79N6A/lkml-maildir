Hello,
I have tried searching on this issue, but found nothing. I heard from a 
kernel developer at work that a memory error was discovered recently in 
the linux 2.6 kernel that causes data miscompare errors in the generic 
scsi driver when executing blast tests.
Does anyone know more about this???
