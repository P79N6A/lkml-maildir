I just discovered a replicable problem on our server here.  We can use mc
all day no prob, but if an incoming anon-ftp session is logged in, any
attempt to start up mc afterwards on the server just gives a locked screen
with an idle spinner in the upper right.  This happens even if the ftp
session closes, and maintains it until the system is rebooted.
Any ideas what could cause that?  Possible TCP/IP bug in the kernel?
