what is page_valid() here ? pfn_valid() (in current kernel) ?

I welcome to do that if implementation is sane.
pfn_valid() --- check there is a page struct
page_exist() --- check there is a physical memory.
but discussing without patch is not very good. please post your patch.
Then we can discuss more concrete things.
