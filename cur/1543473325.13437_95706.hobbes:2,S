Yep. This is a new function in 2.2.0-pre1. A quick search through the
patch file showed that it was an addition to linux/fs/file_table.c, and
from the filename (and the contents of the file) we see that it is a
filesystem function. So this patch inserts a call to EXPORT_SYMBOL for
put_filp in the correct category in ksyms.c. Now that was easy! Next time
you do it ;)
