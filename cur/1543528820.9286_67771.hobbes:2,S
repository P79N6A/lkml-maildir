It is probably not rmmod that is at fault.  When a module is being
deleted, rmmod calls sys_delete_module which invokes the module's
cleanup_module routine.  I suspect that the scsi_mod cleanup_module is
looping.  Because the code is looping in the kernel, kill has no
effect.
But you have vmware loaded and we have no way of telling what that code
does, the main vmware code is binary only.  It is quite possible that
vmware is causing this problem.  If you can reproduce without loading
any binary only modules, repost the problem.
