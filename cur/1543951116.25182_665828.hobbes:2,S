I get a significant-looking reject from this.  Can you please redo and
resend?
I put my current rollup (against -rc5) at
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/dr.gz
 and the broken-out tree is, as always
at 
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/
It would be better for you to get set up for using mmotm - it is my usual
way of publishing the -mm queue between releases.
