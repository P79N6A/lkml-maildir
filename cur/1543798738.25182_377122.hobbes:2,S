Subject: [PATCH 00/13]  [RFC] IB: PathScale InfiniPath driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here is an initial submission from PathScale of a driver for
InfiniPath InfiniBand HCAs.  The driver is fairly big -- some single
files are more than the 100 KB limit for lkml posts -- so I've split
it up into a patch series so it can be reviewed inline.  The split-up
doesn't make sense functionally but I want to make review as easy as
possible; any final import will merge the driver as a single git
patch.
I've also put the current splitup patchset into my git tree at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/roland/infiniband.git
in the ipath branch.
There are some things I noticed that could maybe be cleaned up, like
having sysctls that set values also settable through module parameters
under /sys/module, code inside #ifndef __KERNEL__ so include files can
be shared with other PathScale code, code in ipath_i2c.c that might be
simplified by using drivers/i2c, etc.  I'd like to try to get a sense
of whether I'm being too picky or whether PathScale really does need
to fix these up before the driver is merged.
Basically I'm trying to feel my way as a maintainer so I can find the
right balance between wanting kernel code to be absolutely perfect and
not wanting to put arbitrary hurdles in front of a vendor who has done
a lot of work on contributing an open driver for their hardware.
I am especially interested in feedback about the mergability of this
driver from the broader kernel community, although of course feedback
from the InfiniBand/RDMA community on IB-specific aspects of the
driver is very much appreciated as well.
Thanks,
  Roland
