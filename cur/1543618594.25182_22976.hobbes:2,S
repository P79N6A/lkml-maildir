Asus A7V133 with 1.2 GHz Athlon:
<4>Detected 1224.230 MHz processor.
<4>Calibrating delay loop... 2444.49 BogoMIPS
<4>Memory: 771764k/786352k available (1104k kernel code, 14196k reserved, 
303k data, 224k 
init, 0k highmem)
System feels fast normally, and feels noticable slower with disconnected
feature. The problem with vlc is it's timing fragility to get smooth video 
and synchronous audio output. (I also need alsa > 0.9.0 and XVideo scaling 
on my Matrox G450 to get there, btw).
System is fast enough to compile the kernel during playback without a
hitch. CD copying with cdrdao is a different story. This would be my
ultimate latency check (but haven't played with low latency, yet).
If you like playing vcds and/or dvds, try vlc 0.2.92:
http://www.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/0.2.92/vlc-0.2.92.tar.bz2
It's my stablest player so far. I'm trying mplayer CVS from time to
time, also xine, ogle but vlc is my personal favorite (I'm using a 0.2.92 
CVS version and play plain vob's from my server most of the time).
Ask me privately, if you need any help with such stuff..
