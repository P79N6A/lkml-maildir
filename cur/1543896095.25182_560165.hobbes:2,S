This is an issue for example on DSM systems where memory is virtualized by 
transferring pages of memory on request. We are also getting into embedded 
systems using NUMA for a variety of reason. Devices that can only reach
a subset of memory may come about there.

Yes I did some of that work. But that is still from the perspective of the 
system as a whole. A device may have unique locality requirements. F.e. it 
may be able to interweave memory transfers from multiple nodes for optimal 
performance.

It wont be difficult if the device has
1. A node number
2. An allocation policy
Then the allocation must be done as if we would be on that node.

Well its more the device driver telling the system where the stuff ought 
to be best located.

Because the sysadmin can set the containers up in a flexible way. Maybe we 
want to segment a node into a couple of 100MB chunks and give various apps
access to it?

But its not available for interleave f.e.

I am not sure what you are talking about.

Right we need a clean interface and something that works in such a way 
that people can understand it. The challenge is to boil down something 
complex to a few simple mechanisms.

We have these bad hacks for shmem and for hugetlb where we have to set 
policies in the context by creating a fake vma in order to get policy 
applied.
If we want to allocate for a device then the device is the context and not 
the process, same thing for shmem and hugetlb.

If we do this then it needs to be consistently supported by the 
allocators. Meaning the slab allocators would have to support a call where 
you can pass a policy in and then objects need to be served in conformity 
with that policy.
