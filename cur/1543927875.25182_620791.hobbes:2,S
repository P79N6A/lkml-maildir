Thanks for the report Ingo!
This is indeed a regression caused by:
commit 050f009e16f908932070313c1745d09dc69fd62b

    [IPSEC]: Lock state when copying non-atomic fields to user-space
For 2.6.24 I'm simply going to revert this change since that
just puts us back to the same state we've been for the last
few years.
For 2.6.25 I'll do a proper fix by making sure that every xfrm
state user obeys the rule that if x->lock is to be taken with
xfrm_state_lock then it must be done from within.
Cheers,
