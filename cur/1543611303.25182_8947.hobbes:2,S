Why do you think that fstab matters for root-fs ? root-fs needs to be 
mounted to read fstab. So autodetection must be done for root-fs.
And if the fs has a journal it is ext3. If you do not want that  behaviour
you might use a option to lilo, but I don't know of any option to specify
the root-fs-tyoe. Or you need to use an initrd to mount explicit as ext2
and pivot-root it to / ?
