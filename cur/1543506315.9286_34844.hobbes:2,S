If neither moderation or forced subscription is ok, how about a simple
filter
that reject anything coming from other mailing lists?
I believe there aren't that many mailinglist packages around, and most
leave obvious clues in the headers.  Some have special list-fields,
some have owner/sender set to obvious stuff like "owner" or "listserv"
Rejecting the most obvious subjects (make money fast, sex, anything
in all capitals) would be possible too.
Some spammers would still get through of course, but we would
at least not get other mailing lists.
