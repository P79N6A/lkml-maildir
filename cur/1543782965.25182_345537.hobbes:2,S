Subject: Swap areas lose their signatures after reboot

Hello,
We have a machine with much RAM and 4 SCSI disks. We want to have 8 GB
of Swap space. So I partitioned the hard disks with one swap partition
of 2GB on every disk. But only the swap partition of the first disk can
be used after a reboot; the other three swap partitions lose their swap
signature.
When I call "swapon -a" manually, it says "Invalid argument" for these
three partitions. After executing "mkswap" on them, "swapon -a" works
fine. But I have to call "mkswap" after every reboot.
What happens with the swap signatures during reboot?
Regards
  Christoph
