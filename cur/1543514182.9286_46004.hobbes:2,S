What is wrong with this?  The pfkey_msg->sadb_msg_len contains the
size of the message extension in long-long's, in other words 64-bit
blocks, not octets.  Other than that, is there something I am missing?
I am in the process of fixing the userland code that should actually
try to empty the queue as well, but it should not depend on that.

I will have a look at the tulip driver.  It is a little more parsable
now, but pfkey_destroy_socket is still a huge mess because I am still
trying lots of different things to try to understand the problem.  If
you cannot parse it, perhaps you are not investing enough effort!
(just kidding, a reference to some of your previous comments about the
Linux network code ;-)
I have checked in an update.
