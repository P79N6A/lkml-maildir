Subject: [RFC] kbuild: Specify default target during configuration
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/5/30/100

Following patchs allows one to specify default target when
doing make *config.
This has the advantage that kbuild knows the final target, a knowledge
that is required when building rpm's or deb's.
The following patch introduce selecting default target for i386,
and is mainly a RFC. If there is no big complains I will update it
to cover a few more architectures before submitting.
Comments to the suggested help texts is also appreciated.
