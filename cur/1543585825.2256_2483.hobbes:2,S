No, you got fired for not setting ulimits. Your boss is right
then!
ulimit -d 65536
ulimit -v 81920
and my netscape is very happy most of the time.
And my system is not disturbed.
64MB RAM + 256MB swap.
In a school I had the same setup on a 256MB server (256MB swap)
serving apps (StarOffice and Netscape) to  ~16 X clients.
I never had OOM there.
I think this is the amount of memory an oracle server at least
have to have, right?
What are your ulimits? What are your amounts of RAM+SWAP?
