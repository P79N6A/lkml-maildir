Indeed.  IMO, argument for sizeof(*p) is bullshit - "I've changed a pointer
type and forgot to update the allocation and initialization, but this will
magically save my arse" is missing "except that initialization will remain
bogus" part.
I've seen a lot of bugs around bogus kmalloc+initialization, but I can't
recall a single case when such bug would be prevented by using that form.
If somebody has a different experience, please post pointers to changesets
in question.
