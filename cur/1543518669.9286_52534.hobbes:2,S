I did'nt mention that all cron related task are clean and deleted !
(/var/spool/cron & /etc/cron.d*, and crond stopped)
I have the same problem with a 2.0.38 kernel.
It is really strange that freeze happens _exactly_ 2 hours from the
time the box is up. Is there any timer in networking or fs code that
could be woken up every 2 hours ?
Best wishes,
