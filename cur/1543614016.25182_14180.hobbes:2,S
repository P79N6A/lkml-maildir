This is an excellent way to give aio the testing and exposure Linus
wants without getting into the commitment / syscall mess.
Stick aio in the kernel, play with it via Tux, etc.  The really
interested can add temporary syscalls.  aio (which I like, btw) will get
testing and in time, once proven, we can add the syscalls.
Comments?
