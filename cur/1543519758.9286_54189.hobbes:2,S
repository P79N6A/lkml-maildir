I could be wrong as I'm half asleep but I think there is still a bug
with Ingo's do_signal fix :-)

Those seems plausible.  There is a similar race to the cpu_idle one in
entry.S which would cause both those problems.

You're right in the diagnosis, but that fix could overflow the kernel
stack due to unbounded recusion.
In ret_with_reschedule, an interrupt can occur after checking
need_resched(%ebx) but before the iret in RESTORE_ALL.g  The interrupt
sets need_resched, but cannot reschedule, and the interrupted task is
already in RESTORE_ALL so it doesn't check need_resched.
I can think of two solutions:
    - cli before checking need_resched (or before checking it a second
      time), and let the iret restore the interrupt flag.  Simple but
      not the fastest.
    - have the ret_from_intr path check if it is returning to an
      interrupted return path, and if so fixup up the return address to
      do the same thing but reschedule instead of return to user mode.
      This has no overhead in most cases.  The standard return path is
      not modified.
Ingo's do_signal fix is still needed in the midst of this.
I'm willing to code either but I'd like an opinion first: is adding a
cli before the need_resched(%ebx) check worth avoiding?
