Please survey this and see how the patch deals with it. Please also
stop asking FUD enabling questions until you look at the patch.

Memory allocators and the like need do to this and this has been dealt
with in the patch. The use of those function isn't SMP safe in drivers,
so any use of those functions and spin-waiting so far has already been
reviewed and dealt with in the patch.

Some of that stuff has been moved into work queues that are used to
defer processing out-of-line, so that it doesn't effect that path.
Just about all you've been saying has been handled by the patch and I
ask you to stop asking stupid question until you've looked at it..
