     I did that, and then it complained about a bunch of undefined references
to pci bus stuff.  I had configured without support for pci bus since it's an
sbus machine I was trying to compile on. 
     So I went back and enabled support for pci bus even though I didn't have
pci bus.
     Then it exploded with the compiler generating something the assembler
couldn't grock on 3c905.c or something to that effect.  So I went into the net
devices and turned off everything except the Lance support. 
     Kernel finally compiled all the way.  Tried to boot and it said;
Booting vmlinux...
     And that's as far as it got.
     I also built 2.3.40 on a Pentium based machine here; had no compile
problems on it, but when I went to boot it did exactly the same thing. 
     Is a newer silo/lilo required?
