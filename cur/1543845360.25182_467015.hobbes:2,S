A few of us hit a snag in Lennert's original patch.  He has a
fix which addresses this, attached.

The 'sub r3, r3, r5' check to determine the compressed kernel size in
arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S doesn't work properly, since at that
point, r3 will have been overwritten by cache_on().
What we can do is to use sp instead, which does not get clobbered in
the meanwhile.  Using sp will give us a slightly higher compressed
kernel image size guess than when using r3, but that's safe.
Bug reported by John Cooper and David Anders.
