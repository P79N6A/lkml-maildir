Yes. Pentium M CPUs offer frequencies is 200MHz steps. And I was pretty
sure, that the conservative govenor works in that case.

Running an "while true; do true; done" will result in process named
"bash" that uses 100% of the cpu. The problem i see is, that the
conservative govenor never considers to switch from 800MHz to 1800MHz
because it's a 1000MHz jump! (i'd consider that as a bug, since the
govenor is non-functional in such an environment)

I would be very glad, if the conservative-govenor would switch to the
three frequencies i listet. The problem is: it doesn't.
AFAIK, AMD Desktop CPUs really support 3 frequencies only :-(
