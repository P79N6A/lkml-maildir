If a drive wants to reallocate a block, but due to some temporary condition
is unable to (vibration, excessive temperature, etc), odds are there's no
way for that drive to "remember" that it needs to reassign that block, so if
you reboot the drive or reset it or whatever, you're back at square 1.
The only "memory" that survives between power cycles in a disk drive is on
the media, so if we can't reliably access the media we're hosed.
