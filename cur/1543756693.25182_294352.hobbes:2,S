this patch only changes xtime_lock back and forth - it does in no way
impact the 'threadedness' of the timer IRQ. (it does not move the timer
IRQ into an interrupt thread.)
nor do we really want to make it configurable - it's non-threaded right
now and we'll see what effect this has on the worst-case latencies.
