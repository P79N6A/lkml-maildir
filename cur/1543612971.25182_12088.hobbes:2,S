Andrea, 
Could you please start looking at any 2.4 VM issues which show up ?
Just please make sure that when sending a fix for something, send me _one_
problem and a patch which fixes _that_ problem.
I'm tempted to look at VM, but I think I'll spend my limited time in a
better way if I review's others people work instead.

Abraham, 
I'll take a look at this issue as soon as pre8 is released.
