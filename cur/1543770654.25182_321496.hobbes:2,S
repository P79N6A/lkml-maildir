If I understand this correctly: NCQ does not work on ICH7 in native mode
(using ata_piix) because in this mode there is no NCQ available, right?

Huh?
My question was if there is a fundamental reason why the AHCI mode of
the ICH6/7 must be enabled by the BIOS, is there a reason why the kernel
doesn't do it, or can't do it?
And of course I'd like to have my ICH6/7 in AHCI mode, for obvious
reasons.
