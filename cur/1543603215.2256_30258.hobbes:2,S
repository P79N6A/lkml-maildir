Folks,
     I have been long time Linux user, but new to this list. I have recently 
installed linux-2.4.10 on Hp Omnibook6000. (850MHz, 512MB) with 
kde-2.2.1(latest release) + RedHat 7.1
Problem:
   Everything works fine if I am using kernel 2.4.4. But with kernel 2.4.10 
system hang time to time. Sometimes it just freezes for 5-10 seconds and 
works after that, but sometime I have to power-cycle. I know there could be  
several reasons for this as I am running lots of services here. But just want 
to ping this list if this is any known problem here. Nothing useful in logs.
Thanks
Rajeev
