Well, the kernel tries to keep a given amount of pages in a "deactivated"
state (deactivated = ready-to-free) so it can keep a low amount of actual
free pages (amongs other benefits). 
Anonymous pages (from your processes) need their space _allocated_ on swap
before they can be aged and possibly written out to swap and freed later.
If you look at the "inactive_target" field on /proc/meminfo you will see
how much data the kernel is trying to keep deactivated.

Yes. Obviously that should not happen. 
What you're seeing _is_ a problem.
