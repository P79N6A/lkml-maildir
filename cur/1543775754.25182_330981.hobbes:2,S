No, but you need CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability. So run it as root.

I'm not aware of a generally specificed command, it's likely that the
ibm drive has a vendor specific one. Or that one of the idle commands
can be configured to park the drive. Or... I'm not sure you'll find
anything interesting in the windows driver, I would imagine that the
user app is the one issuing the ide command (like the linux equiv would
as well).
