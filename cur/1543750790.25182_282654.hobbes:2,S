That's why I put fatattrs in the system namespace, which is wholly owned
by the Linux kernel. Any theoretical FAT-with-xattrs variant would put
those xattrs in the user namespace.
On another note, NTFS-style xattrs (aka named streams) are unrelated to
Linux xattrs. A named stream is a separate file with a funny name, while
a Linux xattr is a named extension to struct stat.
