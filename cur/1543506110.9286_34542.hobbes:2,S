Baloney.  clone() *IS* kernel-level threading.  The library is just
there to provide another API (the posix threads API).  libpthreads
under Linux does have some problems (mostly because the POSIX thread
semantics were chosen by an "equally broken for everyone" algorithm),
but saying Linux doesn't have kernel-level threads is complete crap.

Linux doesn't have (nor does it need) a two-level scheduler, but
that's not the same thing.
