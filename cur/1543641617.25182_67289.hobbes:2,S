Hi,
after 2.4.19-pre4 (or could it be pre5 I haven't tried pre5)
my USB mouse stopped working in X.
Only relevant diff I could find is (same .config) ->
-input0: USB HID v1.10 Mouse [Logitech USB Mouse] on usb1:3.0
+hiddev0: USB HID v1.10 Mouse [Logitech USB Mouse] on usb1:3.0
this is 19-pre4 vs 19-pre6.
Any help ?
TIA,
