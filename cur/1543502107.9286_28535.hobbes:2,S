Hello Marc.
Thanks for your hint, but I 've already got a new module. I only wanted
to share my experience with this fs corruption and point out that the
mkfs in combination with kernel 2.0.36 is a very good memory tester.
Especially for people who don't know if it is the software or the
hardeware that is not working. :-)
