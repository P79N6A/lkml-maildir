While developing the latency tracer in the -rt kernel, Ingo and others
discovered that some SATA controllers can produce very bad DMA
starvation at higher speeds.  A latency trace of such an event looks
like the entire system is going in slow motion.  Presumably, vendors
do this to improve benchmark scores.
Try forcing your drives to a lower speed.
