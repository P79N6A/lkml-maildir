Hello!
I do own an SCSI host controller from Dawicontrol 
( 
http://www.dawicontrol.com/
 ). Model name is "DC-2975 U". 
This host controller has a problem wich is covered within
the documentation inside kernel 2.6.1 in the file
"Documentation/scsi/sym53c8xx_2.txt":
> 10.2.9 Max wide
>         wide:1      wide scsi enabled
>         wide:0      wide scsi disabled
>   Some scsi boards use a 875 (ultra wide) and only supply narrow connectors.
>   If you have connected a wide device with a 50 pins to 68 pins cable 
>   converter, any accepted wide negotiation will break further data transfers.
>   In such a case, using "wide:0" in the bootup command will be helpfull. 
The controller works fine with linux 2.4.x when "wide:0" is set. But
it looks like this option is not supported with linux 2.6.x. I do think so
because of two reasons:
1) Setting it seems to have no effect.
2) From looking at the source:
File drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_2/sym_glue.c defines this:
>static char setup_token[] __initdata =
>         "tags:"         "burst:"
>         "led:"          "diff:"
>         "irqm:"         "buschk:"
>         "hostid:"       "revprob:"
>         "verb:"         "debug:"
>         "settle:"       "nvram:"
>         "excl:"         "safe:"
>         ;
"wide:0" is missing.  I am not good with C and I might be wrong here. 
But reason no. 1 remains true still.
Can anyone confirm if my controller is not supported by linux2.6.x?
If yes, does anyone know if there is a patch or some other help 
available? Is anyone working on this?
  Regards
     Florian
