My K6-2/300 (MVP3, PC100, UDMA, AGP G200) runs flawlessly, with no unexpected 
faults, oops, etc.  it's very fast, and very cheap.  people who have problems
with this hardware should consider getting real PC100, and/or scrutinizing
their BIOS settings.  I just hate to see hardware demonized because a couple
of random messages about trouble.
regards, mark hahn.
