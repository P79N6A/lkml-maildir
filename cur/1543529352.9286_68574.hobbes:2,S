If you do it inside the network device driver, you need to copy the
sk_buffs anyway because network device drivers are not allowed to modify
sk_buff contents beyond (and incuding) skb->nh.* (otherwise, you
will break stuff like tcp retransmission). Just allocate the target
skbuffs large enough or allocate several of them before copying.
You can limit the size of the sk_buffs passed to your driver by
resetting dev->mtu to a lower value.
