Uhhhm, ok, no big objections to -pre3 arose, but
Daniel Phillips found a naughty little bug in ext2fs. However,
Ville and Samuli have run quite a few tests with Daniel's patch,
and cannot seem to trigger the bug any longer.
Hence I'm declaring this the first release candidate for 2.0.40.
Try it out, please.
