I know you have sent me patches to prevent multiple entries of the
same name some time ago and I can see we argued about it. The main
point I have with such checks is, that we dont prevent root from
doing rm -Rf / either. There is no reason to clobber the kernel with
endless checks of such cornercases (which even dont make the system
unusable, but only one (unimportant) part of it). There is even one
truely nasty "exploit" of binfmt_misc, if you register an entry
that catches standard elf programs and do module insertion of the
elf and misc handler in the right order... how would you catch this!?
