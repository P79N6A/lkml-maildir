I also checked a non-SMP and non-preempt kernel. Both make my system
crash when killing the X server.

So getting the oops is really hard. I can't get it via serial port and
the netconsole (it uses an e100) is also not working. I tried to run
framebuffer, but I can only use vesafb and the resolution is nothing
better than any text console and I wasn't able to change it. So taking a
picture of the oops is also not an option. What other possible ways I
have to finally get the oops out of the system?
And btw why can't I compile the intelfb on x86_64? I use the internal
graphics card (8086:2772) of the D945GNT motherboard.
0000:00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 945G Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)
The Kconfig file makes it unselectable on x86_64 system.
config FB_INTEL
        tristate "Intel 830M/845G/852GM/855GM/865G support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
        depends on FB && EXPERIMENTAL && PCI && X86 && !X86_64
It seems that the most recent support in this driver is for the 915G and
not for the 945G. Are they so different that we need a complete new
driver or is the !X86_64 a relict from old times?
Regards
Marcel
