Odd, I'm unable to replicate that behavior here.  If I run "ls /var/ 
sub2/sub2" I don't get any entries.  Find and ls -lR have error  
messages of that because it can occasionally be triggered with  
symlinks and such.

Well, actually, it isn't that hard.  Just run something like this:
#! /bin/sh
mkdir /a
mkdir /b
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /a
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /b
mkdir /a/old
mkdir /b/old
tool_to_fork_in_new_namespace sh -c "pivot_root /a /a/old && umount - 
l /a/old && read"
pivot_root /b /b/old && umount -l /b/old && read
All you need to write is tool_to_fork_in_new_namespace which does  
clone(CLONE_NEWNS) followed by exec().
