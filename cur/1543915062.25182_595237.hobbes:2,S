With another patch pending for 2.6.24, to validate the MMCONFIG aperture 
against the ACPI motherboard resources instead of the E820 table, we 
have to delay switching to MMCONFIG until the ACPI interpreter is 
available (unless no other configuration mechanism is available). It 
might thus be feasible to delay it further.
Nevertheless, I think this is a rather ugly workaround for the 
underlying problem.
