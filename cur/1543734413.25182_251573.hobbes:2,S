Yes, on a server you would probably disable threading for the disk and
network IRQs (the VP patch lets you set this via /proc).  This feature
effectively gives you IPLs on Linux, albeit only two of them.  For
example to prevent heavy traffic on one network interface from impacting
the latency of the other, you could enable threading for the first and
disable it for the second.
I am still unsure why the IDE i/o completion is the one place that
breaks the assumption that hardirq handlers execute quickly.
