As a data-point, I once screwed up the bios on an ASUS P2H4 motherboard,
and tried to boot linux when all the system could still do was starting a
boot floppy.
The boot worked succesfully until it had to really read something from the 
IDE-harddisk. At that point it failed completely. I did some extra experiments
with forced geometries in lilo, but to no avail.
Still, I was already quite far into the boot, and I suspect that if the IDE
initialization could be done without the BIOS, it would in fact have worked.
(since it got a bit boring, a flashed a working BIOS again :-) )
