distribution: modified debian sarge, in which aspect is the distribution
important for this problem? mkfs2.ext2 is supposed to write to /dev/sdaX
and not /dev/rd/0. Stracing it and grepping for open calls shows that
only /dev/sdaX is opened in read-write mode.
hardware:
beo-05 and beo-06: cpu: xeon, acpi shows S3000PTH board, memory 2GB
(board too new for EDAC), piix sata controller
beo-106: Dual Core AMD Opteron, no idea what kind of board, 4GB memory
(k8_edac monitored), nforce sata controller
beo-01: Presently can't connect to it, afaik another intel system
(all system are running in x86_64 mode)

I already tested several partition types, e.g. something like this for a
test on sda3
beo-05:~# sfdisk -d /dev/sda
# partition table of /dev/sda
unit: sectors
/dev/sda1 : start=       63, size=  4208967, Id=83
/dev/sda2 : start=  4209030, size=  4209030, Id=83
/dev/sda3 : start=  8418060, size=313251435, Id=83
/dev/sda4 : start=        0, size=        0, Id= 0
For the tests nothing was mounted.

No raid during the tests on sda, of course. 
When sdaX was part of a raid testing the raid device, the corruption did
NOT happen.

Swap already entirely disabled.

Suspected this first too, but the tested partition was never used as
swap partition (first always tested on sda4 and sda2 was used for swap),
later I entirely disabled the swap.
Thanks,
Bernd
PS: I took me about 10 hours of testing, before I wrote the first mail.
Took me that time to believe that its really a kernel bug.
