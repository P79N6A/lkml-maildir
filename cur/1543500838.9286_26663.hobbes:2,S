One difference is that within do { ... } while(0) block
you can use break or continue to leave the block (yes, both break and
continue will work the same way here) - a kind of structured goto;
For example of such use, please look at file ipc/shm.c and search for
'while (0)'. Another example is in drivers/video/atafb.c (__initfunc);
In general there are very few examples of such usage in kernel source.
