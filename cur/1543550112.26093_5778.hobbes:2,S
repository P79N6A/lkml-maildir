I'm using a little proggy from Christoph Rohland (swptst.c), and
do not have to jump through any hoops to reproduce the freeze.

If a kdb call trace will help (doubt it.. see below) I can post one.

Not here.  I looked at it with an IKD kernel, and here it's the same
loop as before.. __alloc_pages() running through try_again forever.
inactive_clean=0, a few pages bouncing between active and inactive_dirty.
__switch_to() never happens.  (though I can artificially yield and thus
make sysrq-e work.  Artificially scheduling only ensures that all other
tasks loop the same way. [coz inactive_clean=0.. page_launder() is always
failing to find something freeable])

I'm still at < 1 minute survival.. with many seconds to spare ;-)
I have yet to have a run succeed, though virgin source _does_ last
a bit longer (odd) than KDB enabled kernel.
