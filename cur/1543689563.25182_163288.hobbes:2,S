Actually, ip over scsi cannot accomplish the goal listed above.
what is beeing looked for here is the scsi equivalent of the USB 'gadget'
driver, letting linux be at the slave end of things as well as the master.
does anyone have an idea why *BSD was able to do this, but all the linux
projects seem to get stuck half-finished? is this just added complexity
due to the large number of linux scsi drivers or is there something deeper
in the system?
