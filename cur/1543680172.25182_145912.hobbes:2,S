This statement is inconsistent with the description of this scenario in
Steven's TCP/IP Illustrated.  Specifically, continuing the handshake in the
TCP layer, i.e., sending a syn/ack and moving to the syn_recd state, is
incorrect if the limit of the server's socket backlog would be exceeded.
How do you account for this discrepancy between linux and other
berkeley-derived implementations?
