Subject: [PATCH] tcp: limit window scaling if window is clamped
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This small change allows for easy per-route workarounds for broken hosts or
middleboxes that are not compliant with TCP standards for window scaling.
Rather than having to turn off window scaling globally. This patch allows
reducing or disabling window scaling if window clamp is present.
Example: Mark Lord reported a problem with 2.6.17 kernel being unable to
access 
http://www.everymac.com
# ip route add 216.145.246.23/32 via 10.8.0.1 window 65535
I would argue this ought to go in stable kernel as well.
