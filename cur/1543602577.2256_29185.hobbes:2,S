Subject: 2.4.10 crashes hard when starting X.

When I tried 2.4.10 my machine crashed really hard upon starting the
Xserver, not even alt-sysrq-SU worked, but alt-sysrq-B did reboot the
machine. I've been trying divide and conquer to find out which kernel
that crashes my machine from 2.4.8 and 2.4.10.
2.4.8        works fine
2.4.9        works fine
2.4.10-pre8  works fine
... (will try other kernels between pre8 and final tomorrow)
2.4.10       crashes hard
I can here the monitor changing resolition just before the machine
halts, but the screen is all black so I can't see any oopsmessages.
I've tried with and without FB-console and with and without DRI
enabled.
Since alt-sysrq-S doesn't work, there is no usable message in
/var/log/messages or output from startx.
The only patch applied is the ext3 patch.
The system is a Pentium II and the graphics card a Voodoo3 3000.

If some fields are empty or look unusual you may have an old version.
Compare to the current minimal requirements in Documentation/Changes.

Is it an AGPGART issue perhaps. I've tried with and without IOAPIC on UP
after reading the mail from Matthias Andree. Should I try XFree 4.1.0?
