So you're saying that these functions:
usb_endpoint_dir_in(epd)
usb_endpoint_dir_out(epd)
usb_endpoint_is_bulk_in(epd)
usb_endpoint_is_bulk_out(epd)
usb_endpoint_is_int_in(epd)
usb_endpoint_is_int_out(epd)
usb_endpoint_num(epd)
usb_endpoint_type(epd)
usb_endpoint_xfer_bulk(epd)
usb_endpoint_xfer_control(epd)
usb_endpoint_xfer_int(epd)
usb_endpoint_xfer_isoc(epd)
Should be defined in ch9.h instead of usb.h?
If that's the case, then I'll be glad to cook up a patch! :)
