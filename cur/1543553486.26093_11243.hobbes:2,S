I doubt you need this category :)

Most drivers are done, and all of the important drivers are done
(IMHO).  Maybe we could move this to a cleanup category?  Its definitely
not a showstopper..

update:  frank davis patch is poor.
DMFE accesses multiple hardware registers for a single operation, and
requires SMP locking to synchronize between all that code.

Haven't heard any update on this in a long while...

I thought this was complete a long time ago?

There exists a patch which makes MOD_xxx in net drivers obsolete.  I'm
hoping that one will get applied...

His patch looks ok to me, too....   Does somebody want to submit this
patch to Linus?  I haven't seen the maintainer (Richard Gooch) speak up
on this issue at all.

Done.

Move to "in progress"...

"fall forms"?
David clearly has problems w/ pcmcia, but it is not at all as broken as
he makes it out to be:  all my cardbus laptops boot and work.

No showstoppers AFAICS, but small races do exist.

Again "whatever".  The CardBus code is definitely usable.  It is not
mature, but saying it is "basically unusable" is wildly inaccurate.

I'm hoping this is fixed in test10, but haven't gotten any reports back
yet...

Do Stephen Tweedie's recently posted kiobuf patches fix this issue?

a fix patch for file locks (related to nfs, but still it appears to fix
some general issues)  was posted this week:

More than just on reboot.
