Fortunately, compatibility is compatibility, and none of these are
relevant. :)

On 32-bit systems, the kernel is mapped into the last gigabyte of the 4
GB address space for every process. On 64-bit systems, the kernel is
mapped in the negative half of the 64-bit address space for all
processes, which leaves the top gigabyte of the 4 GB address space free
for userspace use.
Most of the time this just means more memory for the processes that need
it, but (as you have discovered) sometimes it can cause problems, which
is why the setarch command has the --3gb flag.
