...except for the pretty name, of course.
But IMO we need to stop drivers and core from printing out pretty-name
at all, which is another reason for my patch.  Having name information
like this in the kernel, overall, is a waste, IMO.  _Especially_ when
that information is conditional.  We should be consistent with what we
print out, to reduce user confusion.
