I'll agree with what Willy wrote here, Bugzilla is a pain to use, you
can't just dump an email into it and have it captured.  I think we
should be looking at something more like 'WebRT' which is an *issue*
tracker software.  But that too might be too heavy weight and too
noisy as well.
And suddenly it would starting putting ticket numbers onto all the
non-problem conversations we have here on lkml as well, which I'm not
sure we really want.
Does it mean that we needs to have a 'bugs@kernel.org' email for
people to report bugs/problems/issues, while lkml remains (but is
copied for all 'bugs@kernel.org' emails) primarily the developer point
of contact?  
The question to me really revolves around how do you automate the
process in a transparent manner so that people don't have to change
much how they interact with lkml.
