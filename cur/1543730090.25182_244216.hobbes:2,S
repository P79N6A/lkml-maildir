Let me give some additional remarks to clear up things:

Not checking for Write access permissions at this place is a typical mistake
made by novice programmers, so I never thought this could be in Linux.....

If Linux still noes not check for write permissions, I would consider there is 
still a bug.
If there is a list of "aparently safe" SCSI commands that are allowed to be 
executed, then there is another bug in Linux. The only SCSI command that could 
be called safe if Test Unit Ready and even this only if not send more then once 
every few seconds.
There are several SCSI commands that look safe but would result in coasters
if issued while a CD or DVD is written.
Conclusion: It makes no sense to start implementing a fine grained security 
model before basic secutity has been done correctly.
The best immediate fix for the problem is to just check for read & write 
permissions on the file descriptor and otherwise revert to how it has been
before 2.6.8.
