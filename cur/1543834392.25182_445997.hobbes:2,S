Yeah, please stop it.
Did you actually _look_ at what indent does to code sometimes?
It sometimes (often?) renders perfectly readable code into a
huge blob of crap.
Face reality. The linux kernel is following the general codingstyle
very well already. I don't think there is need to improve the current
codebase for non-existent codingstyle issues. And we already review
new code for codingstyle issues, so the codebase remains clean.
Look at other projects with horrible codingstyle problems
and suggest solutions to their _real_ issues. *cough*kde*cough*
