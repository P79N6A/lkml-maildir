Okay, 2 comments:
(a) The most permissive scheme possible given architectural constraints
	I'm aware of (thanks, rmk) would only disallow below PAGE_SIZE,
	or basically !vma->vm_start. mm->brk affects executables with
	high load addresses and prevents the use of the lower 128MB on
	ia32, which I personally make extensive use of in order to move
	program stacks out of the way of larger mmap()'s and to conserve
	pagetable memory.
(b) sys_mremap() isn't covered.
Does the following give you any new ideas?
