So this would be more like an in-kernel keyring then?

How does it cope with lifetime issues such as token renewal and
invalidation?
Does it provide for notifiers in case of invalidation, renewal or token
expiration?
For NFSv4 for instance, this is important, since the client will want to
evict all state if the user's credential expires.
Cheers,
