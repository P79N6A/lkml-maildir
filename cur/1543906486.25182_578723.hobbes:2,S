Sadly, this doesn't show the "extended family" stuff from cpuid.
So it doesn't show any of the bits we actually care about. Sad.
That said, the "AMD Turion(tm) 64 X2 Mobile Technology TL-52" _should_ be 
a REV-F CPU afaik, and it should have thus fallen through to the 
"ENABLE_C1E_MASK" logic. Afaik that's broken.
Cal - can you
 (a) test that forcing a "return 1" from that amd_apic_timer_broken() 
     function fixes it for you.
 (b) make that function print out the values it uses for debugging (ie the 
     xtended family and model numbers, and the MSR_K8_ENABLE_C1E MSR 
     values)?
Andi, can you check with your AMD contacts that those bits are correct.. 
Maybe the "Mobile Technology" things *always* have the broken "Enhanced 
Halt State", regardless of any MSR settings? That would perhaps be what 
makes them "Mobile".
