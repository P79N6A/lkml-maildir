The nfsd code uses inline in too many places.
gcc can figure out itself that static functions called only once should 
be inline (except currently on i386 due to no-unit-at-a-time, see 
below).

This works currently on i386 (and only on i386) because we are using 
-fno-unit-at-a-time there.
In the medium-term, we want to get rid of no-unit-at-a-time because this 
makes the code both bigger and slower, and I'm therefore not a big fan 
of this kind of workarounds.
If this struct is really a problem (which I doubt considering it's 
size), I'd prefer it being kmalloc'ed.
