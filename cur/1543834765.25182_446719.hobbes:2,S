This looks a little racy to me.  It's relatively benign - a race will cause
us to sleep for too long.  But it's easy to fix:

<looks more closely>
Actually, ssleep() ends up doing
        while (timeout)
                timeout = schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(timeout);
so if the intent of this code is to terminate the sleep early, when the
interrupt has happened then it isn't working right.  A fix would be to
convert the ssleep(3) into schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(3 * HZ).
