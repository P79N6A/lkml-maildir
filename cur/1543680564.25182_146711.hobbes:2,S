That's not a problem at all.  I think the VM never starts
pageout IO on a page that doesn't look like it'll become
freeable after the IO is done, so we simply shouldn't go
into the OOM killer as long as there are pages waiting on
pageout IO to finish.
Once we really are OOM we shouldn't have pages in pageout
IO.
This is what I am doing in current 2.4-rmap and it seems
to do the right thing in both the "heavy IO" and the "out
of memory" corner cases.
