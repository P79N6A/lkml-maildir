Hello
With recent 2.6.25 & 2.6.26-rc1 git (around 1 week) I get occasionally
complete freeze of my T61 during suspend. (dual core, 2GB).
I'm running kernel with no_console_suspend - but all I can see is
blinking cursor on an empty screen - thus even when I run kernel with
most debug options turned on, I can't pass more details so far.  I run
suspend with with SD card in - so maybe some update in the MMC driver
might be responsible for this ?
Also - I think that option no_console_suspend doens't work correctly -
as many times with suspend I do not see any log message on my console
screen. However sometimes the log is shown.
