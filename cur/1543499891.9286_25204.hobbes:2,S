	As no cachefs code available for 2.2.X and my real need of it,
I started writting... after a crazy,nightmared weekend I have:
- /proc fs code complete
- cachemount & cacheumount scripts done
- cachefsd skeleton
- vfs skeleton... just starting my problems:
	Due to lack of VFS programming information, I had to stop writing..
my module loads, mounts and umount filesystem, and play with /proc/fs/cachefs
entries... but does nothing with filesystem itself :-( 
Where can i find info and clear samples ( "read the kernel source" is not enought ) on:
- VFS programming
- Handling dcache and block device operations
- Mapping inodes into filenames and viceversa
- Redirecting inode queries from one filesystem to another
Of course: you can examine backup copy of code at
ftp://drake.lab.dit.upm.es/pub/linux/kernel/cachefs-
(version).tgz
	Really needed help and suggestions. Thanks in advance
