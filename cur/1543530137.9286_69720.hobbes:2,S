Interestingly, I have to reluctlantly accede. Performance is noticably
better on my workstation without swap.
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached

Look .. it has 90MB free ram available and it chooses to swap out
unused pages. This is great .. until I have to swap them back in again
at ~ 1MB/s.  I need those pages infrequently, but more frequently than
I need fresh ram. They're typically something like unused X fonts.
Not complaining, btw. Just observing. The setup is my decision.
