Subject: [linux-pm][PATCH] base: Change power/wakeup output from "" to "unsupported" if wakeup feature isn't supported by a device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/4/66

If a device can't support wakeup, its /sys/devices/.../power/wakeup output is
empty, this is confusing, a user doesn't know if it supports wakeup feature
unless he/she read the ralated source code, for this case, it is more
reasonable to output "unsupported". Otherwise, no matter what value the user
sets to /sys/devices/.../power/wakeup, the result is the same:  Invalid argument,
so the user doesn't know why.
This patch changes empty output to "unsupported" in order that a user knows
wakeup feature isn't supported by this device when he/she
'cat /sys/devices/.../power/wakeup', please consider to apply, thanks.
