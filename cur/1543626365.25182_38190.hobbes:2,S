Subject: any problems with gcc 3.0/3.1 and compiling 2.4.18 on ppc?

We're looking at moving to gcc 3.x for 2.4.18, and are trying to decide what
version to use.  It appears that there were some ppc-specific fixes that went in
to 3.1, and I'm not sure if they were ported back to 3.0.
Has anyone had any successes or failures using either of these versions on ppc? 
Any gotchas?
Thanks,
Chris
