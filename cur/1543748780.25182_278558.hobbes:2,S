I wouldn't say that NMI isn't used in production, if we didn't cater for 
NMI it'd be hard to do high sample rate profiling with Oprofile and 
dynamic-hz. I consider (non)kernel developers profiling code on systems as 
production use.

I have a few personal systems which really would benefit too ;)
