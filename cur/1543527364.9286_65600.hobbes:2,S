All the examples have been bitwise operations on the results of
comparisons.  E.g., how (a == b) | (c > d) is faster than
(a == b) || (c > d) but the compiler doesn't take advantage of it.
Comparisons always return 0 or 1 so your point does not apply.
Of course there are occasions when a bitwise operation on integers is
used in a test: if (a | b) for example is often faster than if (a || b).
That is legitimate too.
Fortunately from a software engineering viewpoint, almost everyone
writes using the || and && operations like you're supposed to, and we
rely on the compiler to do a reasonable job.
