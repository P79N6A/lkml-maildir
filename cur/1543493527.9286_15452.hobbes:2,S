It accomplishes several things.
1) legacy support ie. use same old sources for awhile
2) can be easily varified with external tools.
3) proven to be accomplished very early in the processes lifetime
4) tweakable -- norecompile needed
5) self contained configuration

Yes but it lacks a few things that I'd like to see and it doesn't stop you
from using the new api's to change things during the processes but doesn't
require it.

Other kernel changes are needed. Did you see what happens in the present
kernel when you do an exec or cast out root from ruid and euid?
The patch I have out tries addressing some of those issues also.
As another intersting observation right now elf headers also have the
interesting property of being the only gate that know of to get non-root
cap-enhanced processes that I've seen for the linux kernel.
The standard legacy behavior of the present kernel makes it impossible to
keep caps when you become non-root.
