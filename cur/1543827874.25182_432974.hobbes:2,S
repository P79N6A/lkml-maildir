On one hand, switching to local counters can be a good idea if they are not
evicted from the caches by the usual NRU/LRU cache replacement...
On the other hand, I do not think the ia64's fetchadd instruction is
expensive.
If your data is in L2, then it takes 11 clock cycles.
I do not think the counters have got much chance to stay in L1.
Anyway, L1 is write through, you'll need to copy the updated value
back into L2.
As the shortest L2 access takes 5 clock cycles...
You need 2 of them. (Assuming a counter is always in L2.)
And add interrupt disable/enable time...
