I think the problem is that ia64 is abusing the 'select' feature.
Select is a reverse dependency.  It should be used to turn things on
which are required for this option to work.  Right now, the generic
config uses it to turn on things which people think you probably want
if you're building a generic kernel.
IMO, the select statements should be deleted.  They make it impossible to
build a generic kernel without ACPI or NUMA.  While both are ubiquitous
in ia64 implementations, they really aren't mandatory.
