Publish the dump of the e820 map you get at the start of boot.
You'll probably find that the 4Gb of RAM is spread over a range of
physical addresses > 4Gb in size (for a start, there's a PCI window
from 3.75 to 4 Gb). If there's no other bigger holes, probably it's
faster if you just let it waste that 256Mb.
