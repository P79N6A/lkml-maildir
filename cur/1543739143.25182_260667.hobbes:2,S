These are two seperate problems from my guess.
Mount the file system read/write and start slamming it with heavy disk
activity. If it locks up, then it might just as well be a problem with
the journaling code and the softirq system backing it. I ran into this
in my project and it was the softirq related IO code all of the way down
to the SCSI driver.
It was difficult to get debug messages during a deadlock and I don't
know what kind of mileage you'll get by doing this.
