There quickly turned up two issues which this patch when
hitting -mm.
Issue 1) Adding the ARCH ?= caused all native builds
to loose their ARCH setting. I only tested this with
my suite of crosscompilers and not native.
Issue 2) When installing the kernel in a different
environment than where is was compiled turned up that
we even for a modules_install or headers_install call
gcc - and with CROSS_COMPILE set the gcc could not be
located and we printed an error message.
The latter issue require some more involved refactoring
of the top-level Makefile and is thus not ready until next
merge window.
The patch will be withdrawn for now and I hope to have
the top-level Makefile refactored until next merge window.
The prime reason for the refactoring is to remove the top-
level Makefile from the 3xun list.
3xun = Unreadable, unhackable, unmaintainable
Introducing said patch afterwoard is just a nice bonus.
