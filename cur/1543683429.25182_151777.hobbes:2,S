They aren't used at the same time (as power management, at least), but
they should be usable together (ACPI doing things like CPU enumeration,
APM doing sleeps), and even more importantly, you should be able to 
compile both, and if ACPI is disabled or the BIOS doesn't have an ACPI 
table, the power management should just fall back to APM.
So they definitely aren't supposed to be mutually exclusive from a
configuration standpoint.
