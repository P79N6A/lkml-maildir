or, better yet, as the next tasklet in the chain after the softirq
dispatcher, since I/Os almost always unblock as a result of something
that happens in an ISR or softirq

yep.  That way you can exploit this nice hardware block called an MMU.

to a kernel programmer, all userspace programs are chains of syscalls.  :-)

except you still have the 80% of the code that is half-assed exception
handling using overloaded semantics on function return values and a
thread-local errno, which is totally unsafe with fibrils, syslets,
clets, and giblets, since none of them promise to run continuations in
the same thread context as the submission.  Of course you aren't going
to use errno as such, but that means that async-ifying code isn't
s/syscall/aio_syscall/, it's a complete rewrite.  If you're going to
design a new AIO interface, please model it after the only standard
that has ever made deeply pipelined, massively parallel execution
programmer-friendly -- IEEE 754.

you still need this, for efficient handling of speculative execution,
pipeline stalls, and exception propagation, but it's invisible to the
interface and you don't have to invent it up front

compat code, yes. nighmare, no.  Just like kernel FP emulation on any
processor other than an x86.  Unimplemented instruction traps.  x86 is
so utterly the wrong architecture on which to prototype this it isn't
even funny.
