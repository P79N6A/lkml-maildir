Subject: RFC: cleaning up the in-kernel headers

I'd like to cleanup the mess of the in-kernel headers, based on the 
following rules:
- every header should #include everything it uses
- remove unneeded #include's from headers
This would also remove all the implicit rules "before #include'ing 
header foo.h, you must #include header bar.h" you usually only see when 
the compilation fails.
There might be exceptions (e.g. for avoiding circular #include's) but 
these would be special cases.
As a side effect, this might also lead to additional cleanups.
This might cause some breakages, but it should usually only be compile 
breakages I'll fix as soon as I see them (or anyone else reports them 
to me).
My plan is to create a git tree where I'll work on this that will be 
included in -mm.
Is this OK for everyone?
