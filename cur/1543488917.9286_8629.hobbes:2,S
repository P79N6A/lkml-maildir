	I just hate it when something is so well written that you are half
way to orbit, after having just gone ballistic, before you realize that it's
a joke...  Seizmographs were already going off when I finally realized
"What the?!?!?  This can't be right..."  Then I realized I had been had
and it was pretty funny...
	Very good...
	I hope not too many people read it and take it serious.
	Mike
