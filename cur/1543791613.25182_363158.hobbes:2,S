Well with no ntpd running on 2.6.14, it appears that my nforce2 board
matches that bug rather well.  About a second gained every minute or
two.

Well it seems whatever was wrong with 2.6.12 for me, isnt' a problem in
2.6.14, as it is not gaining 10 to 15 seconds every minute now.  It is
still gaining a bit though.  I have no tried to run without the local
apic in case that makes a difference.
