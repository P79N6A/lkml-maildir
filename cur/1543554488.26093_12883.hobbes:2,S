Could you please check:
1/ if memtest really worked, as I had problems with 2.4 (in fact, it wasn't
launched, I had to downgrade to 2.3 for having a test) (have you seen a
scrolling bar of '#' ?) (anyway, i'm sending 2.3 binary privatly)
2/ your hardware internal temperature (put your hand into the box)
3/ if every cable is correctly plugged in
It looks to me like an hardware failure, not a software one.
	Arnaud.
