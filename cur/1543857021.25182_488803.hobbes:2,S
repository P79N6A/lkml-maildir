For us it's working well, with no major problems (there was a problem with SMP kernels and the arm mapping, but my kernel is not recent and I didn't find the time yet to update to current versions, so I could not report the bug). We have customers and it works for them.
OTOH I heard from some people who wanted to use the 1394 stack for embedded devices without PCI and they didn't succeed to add support for their selected chipset. 
Bye
Alex
