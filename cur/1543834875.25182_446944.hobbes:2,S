Yes, I once ran out of inodes because logrotate kept rotating and
compressing already compressed and empty logfiles. I can't remember
how many seconds it took me to add 'df -i' to our monitoring system.
This, however, was not a feature of the software. I assume.
So, any company that considers the remote possibility of seeking a
$250,000 solution, where the alternative is to buy a 36GB hard drive,
please give me a call.
Cheers,
Buddy
