Ahh crap, this may bring up another problem. The agpgart _has_ to be
initialised before the i810fb code, otherwise it won't work.
Now that agp_init() doesn't do anything useful, we're relying
on link order.  Whether we get that right or not right now depends..
Needs to be tested by someone who actually uses i810fb to be sure.
Volunteers?  (Just chop out the agp_init call in
drivers/video/i810/i810_main.c), oh and I'm only interested in
feedback from either users of 2.5.69-dj1, or 2.5 bitkeeper tree,
(Linus seems to have taken the first round of AGP updates in the last few hours).
