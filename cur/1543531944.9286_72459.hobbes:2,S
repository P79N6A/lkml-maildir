Wrong. Think about it

If that is the case and there is no other checking then I think they all need
stripping of their security level. Guaranteed memory allocation makes the
signalling easier
I malloc 160Mb and see if it failed.  If it failed then the big batch job in
the other compartment is running which means the battle sim is running.
The failed allocation gave me information about another compartment.
