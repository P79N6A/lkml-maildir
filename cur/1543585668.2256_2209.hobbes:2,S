I have been using 2.4.0-ac20 for about a week, and today suddenly got a slew of messages:
EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,1)): ext2_new_block: Free blocks count corrupted for block group 43
while copying the mozilla tree (a great way to stress out a filesystem! :)). This is the first such
problem I have had.
