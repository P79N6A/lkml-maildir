Yes, it does help. It's noticable when one is trying to get as much
memory in hugepages as possible. It reaches a certain point where
hugepages are free but pinned due to per-cpu pages. This "certain point"
depends on the number of CPUs as a ratio to the size of physical memory
as well as a certain degree of randomness as the location of per-cpu
pages is not predictable. Worst case is not being able to allocate
something like (NR_CPUS * pcp->high * 2) hugepages even if they are
otherwise free.
By all means if you have a general version, send it and I'll take a
look. If it's more general and nicer but still can be used to drain the
per-cpu lists when high-order allocations fail, I'm all for it.
Thanks Nick
