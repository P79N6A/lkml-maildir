Rather than add sanity checking to modprobe, it would be a lot easier
and safer from a security audit point of view to have the kernel call
/sbin/kmodprobe instead of /sbin/modprobe. Then kmodprobe can sanitise
all the data and exec the real modprobe. That way the only thing that
needs auditing is a string munging/sanitising program.
