if you run,
cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
it will tell you which hardware clock is being used by the kernel. You
can also run,
cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource
which will tell you which clocks are available on your system. You
switch clocks by echoing the name of a clock into "current_clocksource"
As an example, the following switches to the acpi_pm clocksource,
echo "acpi_pm"> /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
The hardware clock that your using could be running to slow. I would
recommend switching the hardware clock and re-check if the time is still
half speed.
