Virtio seems like overkill for either of those things.  It's necessary 
for pure PV but not at all necessary for something like KVM.

In retrospect, IMHO, a shared framebuffer was a bad idea for Xen.  It's 
easy enough for dealing with an unaccelerated display, but once you 
start getting into more advanced features like blitting (which is really 
important actually for decent VNC performance), the synchronization 
becomes a big problem.
If we were to do a PV display driver again, I really think something 
that is closer to a VNC protocol is the right way to go.  There simply 
isn't a significant performance overhead to copying the relatively small 
amount of memory.
So virtio in it's current form would actually be pretty useful for that.
