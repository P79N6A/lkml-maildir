Plus a mechanism for pushing data into it, plus a mechanism for ensuring 
that inaccurate data doesn't get in there, plus some what of pushing 
updates out to users, plus privilege escalation for setting the value, 
plus policy management to ensure that normal users can't mess with the 
autosuspend values for other users? No, this isn't trivial - especially 
when there's a straightforward in-kernel mechanism (only enable it when 
it's known to be safe)

Both /proc/bus/usb and /dev/bus/usb are provided. Anything that fails to 
work with /dev/bus/usb is buggy - libusb copes fine. We're in the 
process of transitioning away from the legacy interface. It could be 
worse - we could have just removed it on the grounds that it doesn't 
work properly.

That's odd. In the "On battery power" tab I see an option to choose the 
action when the battery power is critically low.

The worst case scenario in the "Disable by default, allow userspace to 
whitelist" case is that some machines draw slightly more power. The 
worst case scenario in the "Enable by default, allow userspace to 
blacklist" case is that some hardware doesn't work because of race 
conditions between autosuspend and userspace having the opportunity to 
disable it, or devices not being in the blacklist, or somebody not 
having adequately new usrspace, or...
