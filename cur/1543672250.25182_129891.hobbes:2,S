2.7.13 eh?  Wow, that's optimistic.  I guess Karim and others better get
busy.  Unless Linus throws in about 50 kernels with the -preX naming
scheme like this last time. ;)
Here's nice long uptime:
tstad% uptime
 12:58pm  up 503 days,  1:30,  3 users,  load average: 0.23, 0.04, 0.00
tstad% uname -a
ULTRIX tstad 4.3 1 RISC
I guess Ultrix didn't have a jiffie wraparound problem at 497 days. 
That DEC 5000/200 has run almost continuously for 12 years, except for
the occasional palace revolution/forest fire fiasco.
