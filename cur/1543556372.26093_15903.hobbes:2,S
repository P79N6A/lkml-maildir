It appears that this problem is not fixed.
My destroy_inode() is now
static void destroy_inode(struct inode *inode)
{
        if (!list_empty(&inode->i_dirty_buffers)) {
                printk("&inode->i_dirty_buffers=0x%p\n", &inode->i_dirty_buffers);
                printk("next=0x%p\n", inode->i_dirty_buffers.next);
                printk("prev=0x%p\n", inode->i_dirty_buffers.prev);
                BUG();
        }
        kmem_cache_free(inode_cachep, (inode));
}
After 45 minutes of running the previously described tests:
Dec  2 16:14:30 mnm kernel: &inode->i_dirty_buffers=0xcfe16878
Dec  2 16:14:30 mnm kernel: next=0xc16f3678
Dec  2 16:14:30 mnm kernel: prev=0xc16f3678
Dec  2 16:14:30 mnm kernel: kernel BUG at inode.c:86!
We're throwing away an inode which has live data on its
dirty buffers list.
This is 2.4.0-test11-pre3 + list_del patch + sct's inode
patch (buffer.c, inode.c).  x86 dual processor.  gcc 2.91.66.
I rediffed my tree.  No rogue patches.
It's not an SMP thing - the address patterns match up with the
previously reported uniprocessor corruption.
