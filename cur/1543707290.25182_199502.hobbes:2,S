Actually the same can be done this way either:
config FB_RADEON_I2C
	depends on FB_RADEON && I2C
	select I2C_ALGOBIT if FB_RADEON
to select only I2C_ALGOBIT or:
config FB_RADEON_I2C
	depends on FB_RADEON
	select I2C if FB_RADEON
	select I2C_ALGOBIT if FB_RADEON
to select both.
This adds the expression "FB_RADEON_I2C && FB_RADEON" to the selected
symbol as minimum selection.
bye, Roman
