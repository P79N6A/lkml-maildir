Thanks that you are still after it.  I was busy with other stuff the
whole week, hence no git bisect result from me yet.

The motherboard controls the CPU fan and I believe also the case fan,
probably based on temperatures.  (The manual is buried somewhere and
MSI's download site is down right in this moment.)
The low speeds or the dividers incorrect.  I'll reboot in a minute into
2.6.22(-rc5)  and post the "sensors" output.

Hmm, interesting.  When I now re-run sensors I get
...
Case Fan:  484 RPM  (min = 12053 RPM, div = 16) ALARM
CPU Fan:    89 RPM  (min =  659 RPM, div = 64) ALARM
Aux Fan:     0 RPM  (min = 10546 RPM, div = 128) ALARM
fan5:        0 RPM  (min = 1506 RPM, div = 128) ALARM

(I'm still in 2.6.23-rc2.  Ksensors picked the 484 RPM of the case fan
up too, and that's most certainly the correct speed.  Just the CPU fan's
speed is still wrong; or rather its divider should be 16 rather than 64.)

How comes the divider of one of the fans changed from one minute to the
other?
FWIW, the ``chip "w83627ehf-*"´´ section in Gentoo's /etc/sensors.conf
provides only labels for fan{1,2,3}. It is titled
# Winbond W83627EHF configuration originally contributed by Leon Moonen
# This is for an Asus P5P800, voltages for A8V-E SE.
Should I hardwire correct dividers or pulse per rev in sensors.conf or
is the driver supposed to work the correct dividers out --- like it did
before 2.6.23-rc?
