Roland,
No, I had missed this completely. Sorry.
I just gave it a quick try and it seems to be working fine. I have only 
moved __exit_fs to the top of release_task, not moved exit_namespace after 
it. I will try to run some tests to see if this is working fine. Thanks a lot.
Thanks and regards,
Sripathi.
