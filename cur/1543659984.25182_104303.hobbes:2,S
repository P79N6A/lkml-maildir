Hmm, based on the research I've done, that does seem to be the case.

That's very useful information, thank you!

I've dug through the rss-1.0-1 tarball released by Ziatech/Intel, and
have found the init code that handles setup for the different versions
of the host controller.  Once I decipher it a bit further, I should be
able to handle the two board versions.  Note, however, that my plan is
to disable the driver on standby mode boards, since I'm not really in
a position to work on a RSS capable driver (no hardware or time on my
part, and SOMA isn't interested in RSS).

The docs I have from PT are pretty much specific to the D version of
the card, so I'll try and decipher the differing bits from the rss-1.0-1
code.

I'll do some more experimenting here and try to come up with a patch
sometime next week that should work with your ZT5550C boards.
