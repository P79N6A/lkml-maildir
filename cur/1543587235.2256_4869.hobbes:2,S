That's the goal I'd like to see us achieve in 2.5.  Interrupts are
already in this range (with a few notable exceptions), but there is
still the big kernel lock and a few other long held spin locks to deal
with.  So I want to make sure that any new locking scheme like the ones
under discussion play nicely with the efforts to achieve low-latency
Linux such as the preemptible kernel.

Yes, that is the idea.
