To enable the local APIC on UP P6:
1. set the enable bit (1<<11) in MSR 0x1B; this is documented in the IA32 manuals.
2. map it (set_fixmap(FIX_APIC_BASE, APIC_PHYS_BASE))
3. init it to through-local mode (LVT0 as ExtINT, LVT1 as NMI, mask LVTT/LVTPC/LVTERR)
The disable pin only exists on P5. According to the Pentium spec update, there's a magic
flag in TR12 (I think) on certain P5 steppings which allows the local APIC to be disabled
(as an errata workaround), but I don't know if it works the other way as well.

Would you accept a patch which allows CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC && !CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC?
Also, which interrupt should we use for LVTPC? Last time I checked, there wasn't
room for another APIC interrupt without violating the "at most two interrupts
per priority level" rule.
