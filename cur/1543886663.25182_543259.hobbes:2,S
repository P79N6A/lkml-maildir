Ick, I didn't know that drivers/macintosh was now included for all
arches! Hmm. That's a bit of a problem.
I could do
config PMAC_APM_EMU
        tristate "APM emulation"
        depends on SYS_SUPPORTS_APM_EMULATION
        select APM_EMULATION
        depends on ADB_PMU && PM
and then
config SYS_SUPPORTS_APM_EMULATION
	bool
	default y
	depends on PPC_PMAC
I'll have to run test that.
