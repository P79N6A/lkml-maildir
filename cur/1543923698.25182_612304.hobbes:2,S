Indeed. Using the header file <asm/nmi.h> is seriously misleading for
the PowerPC version, as is the function name touch_nmi_watchdog() -
thius has nothing to do with NMIs on PowerPC, and most probably not on
any other non-x86 architecture as well. 
To make this mechanism generally usable (which is a good idea IMO) the
names should be changed to get rid of the "nmi" reference.
Best regards,
Wolfgang Denk
