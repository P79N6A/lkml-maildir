Uh, are you saying that one ntpd call can set up several different 
adjustments?  I was assuming that any given call would set up either a 
fixed adjustment for ever or a fixed adjustment to be applied for a 
fixed number of ticks (or until so much correcting was done, which, in 
the end is the same thing at this point in the code).
If ntpd has to come back to change the adjustment, I am assuming that 
some kernel action can be taken at that time to sync the xtime clock and 
the gettimeofday reading of it.  I.e. we would only have to keep track 
of one adjustment with a possible pre specified end time.

Correct me if I am wrong here, but I am assuming that ntpd can ask for 
an adjustment of X amount which the kernel changes into N adjustments of 
X/N amount spread over the next N ticks.  This means that, once we have 
done N ticks, we MUST stop doing the correction.  Life would be easier 
if ntpd only asked for rate changes which are to be applied until the 
next ntpd call (which, as I understand it, it can ALSO do).  Of course, 
the issue of missed ticks kicks in here and is the ONLY reason we need 
to do two corrections, i.e. we need only one ntp correction if we have 
not missed a tick.
