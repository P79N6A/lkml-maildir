i've uploaded the -P0 patch:
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.8.1-P0
those who had APIC (and USB, under SMP) problems under previous
versions, are the problems still present in -P0?
Changes:
 - make redirected softirqs and hardirqs preemptible by default. I
   reviewed a number of softirq users and it appears to be safe. 
   Process-level enable/disable_bh still disables preemption, but the
   handlers themselves run in a preemptible way. This preemptability
   should fix e.g. the IDE latencies. It could also fix some of the 
   /dev/random related latencies.
 - fixed a bug in hardirq redirection - we didnt re-disable interrupts
 - updated the IO-APIC changes - hopefully it's more robust now
