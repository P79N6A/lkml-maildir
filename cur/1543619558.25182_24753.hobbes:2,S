But what you are proposing is that I keep N trees for each of my N changes
against the baseline, keep all of those N trees up-to-date, compile
and reboot each of the N kernels for each local or upstream change, and
possibly have N! different kernels to test each combination of changes.

I guess I wasn't very clear then.  I will probably test changes I make
in _order_, but not necessarily in _isolation_.  I may also not test
_every_ change I make individually if it is fairly minor and "obvious".
If the changes are orthogonal, testing kernel+A and testing kernel+A+B
should be enough to tell me that B works without A.  That means I should
be able to send out B without everyone needing A in order to test it.

It boils down to "how much testing is enough" for each of the separate
changes.  Is eyeballing them enough?  Is compiling enough?  Is a single
reboot enough?  I don't have N machines, let alone N!, to test each of
the N changes I have in my tree individually.
There is also value in saying "I've had this patch in my kernel for X
{days,weeks,months} and it works fine", and by your statement above I
could only do this with a single change.
What I'm saying is that I will code a specific change A, test it, and then
usually go on to code the next change B in the tree that has A in it.
Yes, in some cases testing B in isolation is needed (big changes, or
changes which need to be benchmarked in isolation).  In general you
wouldn't make change A if it wasn't worthwhile, and after it's done why
would you not want to continue using it?
Cheers, Andreas
