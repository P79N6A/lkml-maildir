Thank you for looking into. maybe possible.
In this case, 
	1. "the page" was belongs to memcg before uncharge().
	2. but it's not guaranteed that memcg is alive after uncharge.
OK. maybe css_tryget() can change this to be
==
	rcu_read_lock();
	memcg = __mem_cgroup_uncharge_common(page,
					MEM_CGROUP_CHARGE_TYPE_SWAPOUT);
	if (do_swap_account && memcg && css_tryget(&memcg->css)) {
		swap_cgroup_record(ent, memcg);
		mem_cgroup_get(memcg);
		css_put(&memcg->css);
	}
	rcu_read_unlock();
==
How about this ?
Thanks,
