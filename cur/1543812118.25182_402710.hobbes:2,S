Not a lot we can do about the readability issue - we end up with code
like that in some layer of the MMC.  If it's in mmc_queue, it might be:
        u64 limit = BLK_BOUNCE_HIGH;
        if (host->caps & MMC_CAP_DMA &&
	    host->dev->dma_mask && *host->dev->dma_mask)
                limit = *host->dev->dma_mask;
which is equally as (un)readable as your code.
