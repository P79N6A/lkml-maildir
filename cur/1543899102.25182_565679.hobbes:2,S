Hi,
I've just finished to implement an input driver for a simple custom
keyboard (only 16 keys).
I wanted to give it a test through a virtual terminal (CONFIG_VT).
Note that I'm not familiar with this at all so pardon me if I'm saying
something silly.
I noticed that as soon as the terminal is initialized, tty_init() is
called, the input device is open and thus its clock is started. It
sounds strange to me, I would have thought that the input device is
open only when /dev/tty is open. Thus the keyboard clock is started
when the keyboard is really used.
Am I missing something ?
Thanks
