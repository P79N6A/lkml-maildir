I'm not particularly fond of that idea because it only helps for this
particular workload where any one task isn't actually running for very
long.
If however your workload consists of cpu hogs, each will run for the
full wakeup preemption 'slice' you now see these buddy pairs do.
Also, buddies really work for throughput, so I don't particularly fancy
weakening them below what a normal cpu-hog can already do.
