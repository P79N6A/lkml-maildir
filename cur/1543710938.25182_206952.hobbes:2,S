I agree... somewhat.  It would be nice if we could trust every program 
to always do the right thing, always accurately indicate its priority, 
and always yield the CPU at the best time.  But if that were reality, 
we'd still be using cooperative multitasking.
Unfortunately, the OS has to play babysitter to processes, because 
they're guaranteed to misbehave.  Preemption exists to ensure fairness 
amongst processes.  Thus, while you're right that it would be nice to 
have processes report their CPU requirements, if we were to actually DO 
that, it would be a disaster.
