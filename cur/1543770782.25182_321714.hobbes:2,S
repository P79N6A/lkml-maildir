What do you mean it is just software RAID? Can you explain?
On the servers there is a configuration option to enable HostRaid, and when
I turn that option ON the mirroring between the two discs start and after a
while they are mirrored.
I think that in terms of performance it should be better to used the
"on-board" HostRaid facility.
Don't you think so?
