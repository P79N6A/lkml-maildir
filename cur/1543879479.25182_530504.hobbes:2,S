Works great now.  Queue this sucker up!
	# cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
	|/home/caker/bin/dumper.pl
	# ./linux
	<blah blah>
	Segmentation fault (core dumped)
	# file /tmp/dumper.out
	/tmp/dumper.out: ELF 32-bit LSB core file Intel 80386, version 1 
(SYSV), SVR4-style
Thanks for everyone's help.
