Guys, let's not take it to init/main.c, please.  That file is basically
a trashcan and I'd rather take that stuff to more or less relevant places
in kernel/* and fs/*.  FWIW, I've done that with init_files (fs/file.c)
some time ago.  For init_fs...  Hell knows.  Might make sense to take
that to separate file, actually (kernel/exit.c and kernel/fork.c bits
related to fs_struct).
BTW, why does sparc64 export put_fs_struct?  And is there any good reason
for doing copy_fs_struct() in nfsd instead of just teaching kthread_create()
how to create threads without sharing fs_struct (or descriptors, while we
are at it)?
