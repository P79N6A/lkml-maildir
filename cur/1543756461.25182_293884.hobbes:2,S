	Depend what you call "bugfix". Fortunately, with the long beta
period I do with the WE, bugs are few. There are only two "bugs" in
WE-16 I'm aware off (fixed in WE-17), but I don't think they are worth
fixing.
	The first is the handling of spyoffset which is potentially
unsafe. Unfortunately, the fix involve some API/infrastructure change,
so is not transparent. Fortunately drivers are clever enough to not
trigger this bug.
	The second is a potential leak of kernel data to user space in
private handler handling. Few drivers use that feature, there is no
risk of crash or direct attack, so I would not worry about it.

	If people want to use 2.4.X, I won't prevent them...
	Have fun...
