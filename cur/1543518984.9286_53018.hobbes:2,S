I'm writing a kernel driver with my own page fault handler on 2.2.13. It
insmod fine. When I run a app that uses this device I get a "Trace/BPT
Trap" printed to the console. Also the program finishes but a ps shows its
still running. If I do this a few times the kernel panics and locks up.
Anyone know what causes this? Thank you.
