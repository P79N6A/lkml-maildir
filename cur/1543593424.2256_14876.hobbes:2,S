The trace definitely looks suspect, I cannot see any BUG() calls in
proc_getdata(), even looking at the object code.
Does
  objdump --start-address=0xc01269f9 --stop-address=0xc0126a10 vmlinux
show the same code bytes, starting with ud2a?  I will be surprised if
it does.  If it does not then you definitely have the wrong System.map
for the oops.
