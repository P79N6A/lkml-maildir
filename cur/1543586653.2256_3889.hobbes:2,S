Hello all,
I've just installed the new kernel,
And I noticed something wierd:
When I'm running X it works Ok,
but when I log out of it, and runs it again,
it gives me an error about fixed fonts,
If I'm rebooting it will work again(Only one time per boot).
With the 2.2.3 kernel it works Ok.
Please put my email(a_hardon@netvision.net.il),
in the CC, because I'm not a member of this list.
Thanks,
	-Amir.
