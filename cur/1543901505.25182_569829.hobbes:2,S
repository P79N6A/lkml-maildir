the trylocks in lib/spinlock-debug.c:
 static void __spin_lock_debug(spinlock_t *lock)
 {
 ...
                         if (__raw_spin_trylock(&lock->raw_lock))
                                 return;
 ...
 void _raw_spin_lock(spinlock_t *lock)
 {
         debug_spin_lock_before(lock);
         if (unlikely(!__raw_spin_trylock(&lock->raw_lock)))
                 __spin_lock_debug(lock);
         debug_spin_lock_after(lock);
 }
am i missing something?
