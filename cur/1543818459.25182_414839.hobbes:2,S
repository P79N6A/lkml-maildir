Why would you write a driver in assembly in the first place? That makes
it highly unportable, I bet you can't compile your driver for x86 and
ARM from the same source. There are only four drivers in the whole
kernel tree that have an assembly part, but those are so tied to their
platform (Acorn, Amiga) that they aren't portable anyway.

I haven't seen your Makefile so I can't see what's wrong, but see
drivers/scsi/arm/Makefile for an example.
