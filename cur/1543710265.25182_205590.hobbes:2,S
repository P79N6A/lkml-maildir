Just FYI, I have no objection to the changes in this patch to the
SELinux module; we would be glad to have SELinux use this auditing
framework if it is accepted into the mainline kernel.  I suppose we can
separately submit a patch to remove the avc_ratelimit code from the
SELinux avc, as that should be handled by the audit framework itself.
