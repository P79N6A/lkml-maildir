Heh.  I assumed that cpusets didn't deal with memory, and I ignored the
code when I saw it.  Oh well... :)

It shouldn't interact yet because we don't add any NUMA nodes yet, we
only grow existing ones.  The only case that would be a problem is if an
entire node's memory was removed, but that would probably be similar to
trying to bind to an empty node now, or what happens during CPU hotplug
with cpus_allowed set to a now-unplugged CPU.

See kernel/cpu.c:25
/* Need to know about CPUs going up/down? */
int register_cpu_notifier(struct notifier_block *nb)
We'll do the same for memory, I promise.

Other than providing the notifiers, I don't think there's a whole lot
else the hotplug code can do.  That's left for the poor souls working on
the binding APIs.  Memory will probably need some slightly more
informative things that the CPU notifiers because we might have some
more properties that the handlers might care about, but it shouldn't be
fundamentally different.
