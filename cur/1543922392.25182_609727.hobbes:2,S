This case is clearly a bug, a very likely code pessimization.
I guess it wasn't intentional, just an optimization that is useful
for local register values doing too much.

Often accesses happen without function calls inbetween.
Also I think newer gcc (not 3.x) can determine if a pointer
"escapes" or not so that might not protect against it.

We don't have much choice: If such a case is found it has to be marked
volatile or that particular compiler version be unsupported.
It might be useful to come up with some kind of assembler pattern
matcher to check if any such code is generated for the kernel
and try it with different compiler versions.
