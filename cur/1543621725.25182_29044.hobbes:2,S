Partition type isn't available to fs driver. Think about mounting 
floppy/loopback/etc.
Seems you guys are discussing non-problem here. What really needs to be done 
is to add more sanity checks to FAT superblock detection/validation code:
* signatures like 55AA at end of 1st sector
* sane values for various superblock data (if you see "FAT copies: 146"
  it is more than enough to tell it's not a FAT, right?)
If anyone feels so inclined, please go to fs/fat/inode.c:fat_read_super()
and hack on it. Send your patches to Alexander Viro <viro@math.psu.edu>
and tighten your seatbelt ;-)
