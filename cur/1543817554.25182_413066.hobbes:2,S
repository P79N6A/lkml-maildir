The NCQ stuff is *unsafe* with the existing sata_mv.c,
as there are known (to me, at least) bugs that prevent it
from working reliably after the first I/O error of any kind.
The 2.6.16.1 branch is slightly better,
and there is also the "three bug fixes" update
that's in upstream to help things further.
With all of those fixes, the module loads/unloads/reloads fine for me.
If you want to use NCQ more safely, then you'll need to modify
the mv_start_dma() routine to reinitialize the queue pointers
each time, as they can get out of sync after an error.
There are still other bugs to be worked out and fixed, though.
I'll have a patch or two this week for the ones I know about.
Cheers
