Inded it does
scsi_cmd_cache    1547440 1547440    384   10    1 : tunables   54   27    8 : 
slabdata 154744 154744      0
This looks suspiciously large. To be absolutely certain, though, you have to 
reproduce the problem with a vanilla kernel, and no binary drivers anywhere. 
My patches don't touch the scsi code directly, but the only way to be certain 
is to use vanilla.
Cheers,
Con
