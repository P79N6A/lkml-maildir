I'd rather do the compression later on - or do you want
to spend gzipping all day when doing `make foo.ko`
as a developer? ;-)

Assuming that the x in (filesize % 4096 == x) is randomly distributed
over 0..4095 for gzip modules, I proclaim that it is similarly
randomly distributed for noncompressed modules. As such, the overhead
is always there and gzipping does not make it worse or better.
So you always have the overhead.
uncompressed:
$ du as above
113360896
$ byte counted:
109270606
differnece: 4.09 MB
You always pay that price for having single files.
So I dismiss it from the discussion ;-)
