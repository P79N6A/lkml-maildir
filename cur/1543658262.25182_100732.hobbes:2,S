you meant pci_scan_bus() for #1?
(pci_do_scan_bus() is the implementation, but I thought arch code
is supposed to call pci_scan_bus().)

I agree - it looks better. But I fail to see how it fixes the problem
of knowing when we can or cannot disable a device in order to size
the BAR. I'm under the impression some i386 specific code needs to be added
to identify/fixup the broken configurations (memory disabled when
a PCI Bridge is disabled).
I'm thinking the same logic needed by PCI hotplug to allow safe removal
of a bridge device would be useful to determine if a PCI Bridge could
be safely (temporarily) disabled (I'm thinking 4-port 100BT card).
Ie a "no subordinate drivers active" and "not in use" checking.
thanks,
