Yup.

I doubt that very strongly.  Consider that the object need not be
polymorphic; all it needs is a pointer member.  And if you use a
template class, you don't even need the pointer, so it'll be 100% as
efficient as the C version (except one byte for the object itself
(zero-length objects are not allowed (yet))).
Given:
  template <semaphore_t *SEM>
  class hold {
    public:
      hold()   { down(SEM); }
      ~hold()  { up(SEM); }
  };
The code would look like:
  void random_function()
  {
    hold<&one_semaphore> hold1;
    hold<&other_semaphore> hold2;
    // ...
  }
