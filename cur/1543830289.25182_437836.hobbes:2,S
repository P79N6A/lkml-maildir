ok, that's good news :-)

ok, but there are a few logistical issues:
at copy_strings_kernel() time we dont yet know where in the target VM to 
install the pages. A binformat might want to install all sorts of stuff 
on the stack first, before it constructs the envp and copies the strings 
themselves. So we dont know the precise alignment needed.
delaying the copying to setup_arg_pages() time does not seem to work 
either, because that gets called after the old MM has been destroyed.
[ delaying the copying will also change behavior in error cases - 
  instead of returning with an error if the string pointers are bad 
  we'll have to kill the execve()ing process. ]
am i missing something?
