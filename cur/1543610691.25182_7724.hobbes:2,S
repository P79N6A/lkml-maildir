No. Shake my head, the above is a reference to TIP, not THA.
and DHA is already set correctly anyway. (what was I drinking..)
Anyway.. RFC2131 only talks about the format of the arp request and not of
the arp reply.  I will test again to see if OF is testing THA or TIP.
 My guess is TIP.
So how to get the fix incorporated into the kernel though.
I don't see why it would break anything else.
