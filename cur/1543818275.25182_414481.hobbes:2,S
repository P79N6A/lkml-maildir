This doesn't seem to present a problem (other than the eatme loop being 
hard to kill with control-C) on my system using spa_ws with standard 
settings.  I tried both UP and SMP.  I may be doing something wrong or 
perhaps don't understand what you mean by a console lock up.  When you 
say "less than the timeslice" how much smaller do you mean?
Peter
PS I even managed to do a kernel build with the eatme loop running on a 
single processor system.
