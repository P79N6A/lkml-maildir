My bad, you're right I was talking about GFP_USER indeed.
But even GFP_KERNEL allocations like the init of a module or any other thing
that is static sized during production just checking the retval looks be ok.

Signal can be trapped and ignored by malicious task. We had that security
problem until 2.2.14 IIRC.

I agree we should have more information about the behaviour of the system
and I think a per-task page fault rate should work in practice.
But my question isn't what you do when you're OOM, but is _how_ do you
notice that you're OOM?
In the GFP_USER case simply checking when GFP fails looks right to me.
