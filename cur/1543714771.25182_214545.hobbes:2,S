I interpreted his comments to mean PCI-PCI Bridges.
eg something like a 4-port NIC which usually has a PCI-PCI bridge
to "isolate" multiple PCI devices (NICs):

I thought this was already handled though so I may be misunderstanding.
Keiichiro, an example would be very helpful in understanding.

SCSI has a heirarchy as well. Ie LUNs can be removed without
removing the target (RAID controllers). Normal JBOD use equates
LUNs and targets.
