Yep. Its not an ideal situation. People are btw also reporting similar
photoshop oopses in windows. I suspect related problems

Nope - you want the via82cxxx ide support, that is a big performance win as
you get UDMA IDE. The prefetch/movntq optimisations are less of an impact,
so an Athlon with a non athlon optimised kernel is still a killer devel box
