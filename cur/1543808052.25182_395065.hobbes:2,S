But you've never answered the question as to why every other userland
program on every OS uses device names when cdrecord insists on using SCSI
IDs. Do you really think mount, fsck, tar, etc are broken because they let
the user use device names that they're accustomed to like /dev/c0t0d0s0? If
so, I look forward to the day that you try to patch OpenSolaris' userland
to work like cdrecord.

I think it's safe to say that most Linux users are cdrecord users whether
they want to be or not, there's just not any real viable alternatives
except for dvd+rw-tools and they don't work with regular CDs AFAIK.
And if you consider it strange to expect tools to accept normal device
names for the devices they're interacting with, I guess there's not much
hope of ever getting cdrecord fixed.
