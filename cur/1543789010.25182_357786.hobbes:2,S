Maybe it was a bad choice.)

Thanks, that's good news.

a.  The HPET spec says that the HPET block size is 1 KB
in section 3.2.1.
b.  Table 3 (HPET description table) requires an HPET base
address (offset 40), but seems not to require a length.
However, the description text again states a fixed block size
of 1 KB.
c.  Yes, I've seen descriptor.length field value of 0.
Whether it's incorrect is a discussion for an specster IMO.
At least it's debatable (by someone).
d.  Yes, I would prefer to use (valid) length from the descriptor.
Maybe default to 1 KB if desc.length is 0 (?).

OK, maybe you can get Bob Picco or me to add that to our
todo lists.
