  None of headers in response are supposed to be changed between requests
except Date.

  It's in GMT, and IMHO can be omitted. And userspace application can feed
parameters to the kernel just like what is used for kmod.

  This *is* how proxies are supposed to store them, and the whole thing
can pretend to be like a locally runnung "proxy" (like Squid) with cache,
populated by local HTTP server through non-HTTP protocol.

  Apache in kernel space is more like along the lines of sendfile(). This
is more like filesystem + proxy in kernel space, not unlike combination 
of kernel NFS and IP masquerading.
  I don't think that it's a good idea to put a lot of "smart" high-level
stuff into kernel, but providing very simple functionality like this can
be useful.
