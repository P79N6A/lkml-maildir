Fine. I (the hypothetical binary driver maker) will just make two
modules -- one which is MODULE_LICENCEd GPL, and the other which is not.
The first will re-export your interfaces as unrestricted ones which the
second can use. Are we going to start insisting on a transitivity of
this restriction? If so, then it's possible that a large number of
interfaces might go...
I also think this is somewhat ridiculous. If I (the binary module maker)
distribute a program which effectively replicates the functionality of
insmod without the licence checking, and distribute that program with my
module, am I violating any restrictions? I don't think so, since it's
the end-user that ends up linking the kernel to the module. No linked
products are actually distributed...
