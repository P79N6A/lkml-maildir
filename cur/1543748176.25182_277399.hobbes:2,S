Subject: [path 2.6] reduce ext3 log spamming (blank lines)

When drives go offline, e.g. usb-storage disconnect, the
upper layers don't behave very intelligently yet:  ext3
over scsi keeps retrying reads, logging three lines for
each error:
10:58:31  scsi0 (0:0): rejecting I/O to dead device

This patch shrinks that log spam by the trivial third, getting
rid of those needless blank lines.  It's not clear to me why
the "no such device" errors don't immediately make ext3
(or is it the block layer?) give up ... maybe someone else
can make Linux not retry after those errors.

Prevent one ext3 error report from spamming dmesg/syslog with blank lines;
ext3_error() already includes the necessary newline.
