Hi,
As a matter of fact, I don't have special reason to leave RTEs unmasked in
iosapic_register_intr(), iosapic_register_platform_intr(),
iosapic_override_isa_irq().
I think it is better that interrupts are unmasked by individual device
drivers, but
there are some exceptions. For example, PMI and INIT don't need device
drivers.
So I think more investigation is needed about them.
Regards,
Kenji Kaneshige
