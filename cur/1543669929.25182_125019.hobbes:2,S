so, presto_copy_kml_tail() is only called from
presto_finish_kml_truncate(), which doesn't seem to be called
from anywhere. What am I missing here? Or can this whole lot
just be nuked ?
If not, this patch introduces a problem.  You're now
calling a sleeping function (kmalloc) whilst holding
a lock according to the comment above presto_finish_kml_truncate()
