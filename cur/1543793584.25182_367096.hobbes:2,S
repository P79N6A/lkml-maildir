Another point to be taken in consideration is that SystemTap should make
it possible to add such instrumentation on-the-fly.
Means you don't have to maintain such statistics code (which are likely
to change often due to users needs) in the mainline kernel.
The burden goes to userspace where the kernel hooks are compiled and
inserted.
OTOH, when you think of kernel's fast rate of change, that might not be
a very good option.
Just my two cents.
