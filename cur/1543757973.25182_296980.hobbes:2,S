Subject: [PATCH 6/13] no aggressive idle balancing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

6/13
Remove the special casing for idle CPU balancing. Things like this are
hurting for example on SMT, where are single sibling being idle doesn't
really warrant a really aggressive pull over the NUMA domain, for example.
