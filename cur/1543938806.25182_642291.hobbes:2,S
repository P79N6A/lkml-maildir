Do you really need to call it with the runqueue lock held .. There are
other issue with the calls at that level.. For instance in -rt these
call can actually hang the system in the console laying from inside
printk (something I reported more than 6 months ago) .. It would be
better to move them around the scheduler rather than inside it..
