Sorry, you totally lost me.  It could me I'm extremely slow today.  For
option (1), on ia64, clear_bit has release semantic already.  The comb
of __before_clear_bit + clear_bit provides the required ordering.  Did
I miss something?  By the way, we are talking about detail implementation
on one specific architecture.  Not some generic concept that clear_bit
has no ordering stuff in there.
