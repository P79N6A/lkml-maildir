From the GPL, Version 2:
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
Would "proprietary forking" really be considered to be similar in spirit
to the "old" GPL?..
