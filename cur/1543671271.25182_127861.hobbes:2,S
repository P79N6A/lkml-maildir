Thanks for the info!

Very interesting also, the two liner adressed only the well-known problems.
To fix the other not so well-known side effects, a real cleanup is the way
to go.
Can you try the attached cleanup patch instead of the two-liner?
It's an inital cleanup and should fix the other side effects which
I described in my mails.

PS: If either patch is applied correctly, this
	su guest -c 'ps $PPID;wc -m </proc/$PPID/cmdline'
should give:
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
 2452 pts/2    S      0:00 su bin -c ps $PPID;wc -m </proc/$PPID/cmdline
     46
If it does not, access_process_vm is not fixed properly.
Second, calling this as root:
	strace -fewrite su -c /bin/echo 2>&1 | grep pid
should give:
[pid  2599] --- SIGSTOP (Stopped (signal)) @ 0 (0) ---
[pid  2599] write(1, "\n", 1
If it does not, ptrace_check_attach is not fixed properly.
(These are only the checks for the well known side
effects which should be fixed even with the short
is_dumpable() -> task_dumpable patch.)--- kernel/ptrace.c	2003/04/22 21:14:20	1.1
