Nope, the endianness was not a real contributor to the advantages in
performance.  My comment above appears to allude to BE as a reason for
m68ks improved performance.  It was not, really.
Yes, a larger general purpose data and address register set was a big
contributor.  One detractor for the Intel architecture was that the
segmented addressing added complexity to the addressing logic.  Basically
the segment+offset had to be calculated, instead of simply using a linear
address to begin with.  But, you got 20 bits of addressing and a
facility for relocating code, data, etc. in 64k segments.  This would
have been sufficient for it's time, except programmers quickly out grew
the 64k limitation.
