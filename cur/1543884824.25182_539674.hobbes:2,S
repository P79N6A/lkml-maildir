Assembler code is difficult to wrap, there are more places where assembler 
code assumes that the thread_info is at the start of the stack.
Anyway, in this case it looks a little weird that TIF_FORK needs to be 
cleared at every context switch, other archs setup a different return 
address (usually ret_from_fork) and then finish scheduling by calling 
schedule_tail().
