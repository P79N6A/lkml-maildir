It changed in 2.5.5-pre1:
<axboe@burns.home.kernel.dk> (02/02/11 1.262.3.11)
	Remove nr_sectors from bio_end_io end I/O callback. It was a relic
	from when completion was potentially called more than once to indicate
	partial end I/O. These days bio->bi_end_io is _only_ called when I/O
	has completed on the entire bio.
