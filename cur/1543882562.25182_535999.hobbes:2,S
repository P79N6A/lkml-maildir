I think this is very similar to current uswsusp design; except that we
are using read on /dev/snapshot to read the snapshot (not memory
mapping) and that we freeze the system (because I do not think killall
_SIGSTOP is enough).
Can you confirm that it is indeed similar design, or tell me why I'm
wrong? You had some pretty strong words for uswsusp before, so I'd
like to understand your position here. ("Ouch, I do not know, I am out
of time" is still better reply than silence.)
