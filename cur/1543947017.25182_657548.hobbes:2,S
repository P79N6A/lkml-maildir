Oliver,
I tried disabling flow control on the server with stty -F /dev/ttyS2
-crtscts, then echo sometext > /dev/ttyS2, but I get the same results
the echo command freezes will trying to send data to the client.

Could it be that hardware flow control is enabled on the server, while 
it is disabled on the other side? What happens if you disable it with 
stty -F /dev/ttySX -rtscts?
