We use it almost never... a few times per process at most.  And the
overhead will be nonexistent except in cases where the caller has to
wait on the lock --- and in those cases it seems totally reasonable
they *should* have to wait.
    Basically everyone. (And BTW, if we can't even afford one lock per
    module, how could we efford one jock per job? There are definitely
    more.)
I'm not sure what you mean here.
