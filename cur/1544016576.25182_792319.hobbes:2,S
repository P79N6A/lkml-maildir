I'm not an expert in the "classic x86 ioapic behaviour" or in RT
interrupt handling.  My main objections are that the patch as proposed
is a gross hack in the ACPI _PRT lookup path, and that it didn't touch
the non-ACPI lookup path, which should have the same problem.  Now that
Eric pointed out this is just classic behavior, I also wonder why the
quirk doesn't list more devices.
The effect of the patch sounds sort of similar to using "noapic" --
you're basically ignoring the IOAPIC and using only the "boot interrupt"
or legacy PIC interrupt or whatever it is.  Can you contrast it with
that?
