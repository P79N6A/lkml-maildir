In theory, you could add #ifdef's in thousands of places of the kernel 
around functions similarly small to these two ones or sometimes bigger 
functions.
In practice, this would cause breakages in many configurations because 
the #ifdef's might either be wrong (as in your patch) or become wrong 
over time.

This breaks with DVB_USB_DIBUSB_MC=m.
