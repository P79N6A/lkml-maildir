Hi,
the fan driver I wrote for adt746x looks like it only handles the adt7467
chip found in iBooks G4; but it also handles the adt7460 chip found in the
Powerbook G4 Alu.
Here's a patch that renames the file to therm_adt746x.c and updates
Kconfig and Makefile. I also changed a few lines in therm_adt746x.c after
renaming it (the patch contains these), the diff is here for clarity:
