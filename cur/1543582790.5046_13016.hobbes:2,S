I'm getting exactly this problems too. If 3c509 is on eth1 (and maybe just eth > 0),
it gets misconfigured port - i have two 3c509 and only second one doesn't work - but
when i force kernel to assign it 10baseT port, it of course works fine. I wanted to
examine this bug more closely, but unfortunately i have too little time now. But
anyway it looks there is bug in some region manipulation...
