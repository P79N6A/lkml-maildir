   And you would cripple the 99% usage to aid those users who move disk 
   drives physically over to a sparc box AND have more than 31k links to a 
   file?
This is not a sparc or a x86 or x86_64 or ia64 thing.
It's a global thing.
It's about being portable and clean and not installing unnecessary
restrictions.
