Another example demonstrating why xargs is not always good (and why a
bigger command line is needed) is when you combine it with e.g. wc:
	find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 wc
You cannot trust the summary line from wc, since xargs may have decided to
run wc may times, and thus you have may summary lines.  If the kernel
would allow a larger command line, you could run
	wc `find . -type f`
and get exacly what you want.  And if I'm not mistaken, Linux accepts a
much smaller command line than other "unices" such as Solaris.
...but it's not _that_ important...  obviously there has to be an upper
limit somewhere...
