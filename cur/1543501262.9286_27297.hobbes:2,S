Chris,
With regard to your question about re-formating those
520 byte sector disks, this package:
Title:          scsiinfo
Version:        1.7
Entered-date:   24AUG97
Description:    Tools to query information (INQUIRY and SCSI-2 mode pages)
                from scsi devices and to low level format disks. Tcl/Tk
                frontends are provided to make the use very simple.
Keywords:       SCSI information mode pages lowlevel format INQUIRY
Author:         Eric Youngdale, modifications by Michael Weller

                63K scsiinfo-1.7.tar.gz
Platforms:      Linux

has a scsiformat command in it that assumes your sector
size is 512 bytes. It might be worth a try.
Also my sg utilities at
http://www.torque.net/sg
  [follow utilities link]
have some programs that may be of use. You could
mod the sg_dd512 to be sg_dd520 (by changing one
#define). There is also sginfo which is a sg
version of the above mentioned scsiinfo.
