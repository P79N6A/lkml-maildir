Ok, I have eliminated power as a possibility by routing the secondary USB 
connector for the drive to a powered USB hub.  No difference, the drive still 
spins up, and the system still can not read the partition table (the drive is 
known to have a good EXT3 partition on it).
Here are the specifics on the USB card I am using from dmesg:

The output from lspci -vv:

And of course, here is the dmesg output showing the drive not being read:
