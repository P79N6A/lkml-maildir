Heh, I haven't tried it.  Feel free, it should work now.

Yup.  And that sort of thing doesn't come close to reaching the potential
of a virtual OS.
A couple of the intermediate-term things I'm most interested in are
	embedding UML in things like Apache to provide a standard internal

	spreading a SMP UML instance across multiple hosts
