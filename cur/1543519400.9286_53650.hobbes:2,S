My idea isn't to ONLY fix this one, but also fixup some other things.
However, I'll probably drop a pre-patch 1 in some direction soon (I guess
that'd be to Alan?), and that one will probably only contain this fix
together with some documentation updates and maybe some other small
things.
I will release more pre-patches as my reviewing of the patch-log/bug-log
Alan sent me progresses.
