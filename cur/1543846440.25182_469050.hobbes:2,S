Been chugging away for 10 hrs now without repeating that incident. Hmm.
That patch looks like good -stable material. I'll keep digging to
see if I can somehow reproduce the problem I saw with the patch applied,
but in absense of something better, I think we should go with it.
One thing that did happen in the 10hrs was fsx-over-NFS spewed some
nasty looking trace. I'll post that separately next.
