No, you should just not care about anything but
gcc. intel-cc-version-0.3.2.1.2.5 could use __kabi_struct_dirent or
whatever, and collide anyway. By adding __kabi you just make it less
likely.
I believe __ is enough. If there's one conflict with some obscure
compiler, we can simply fix the conflict (or even fix the compiler
:-).
If you feel __ is too dangerous, you may go __k ... It will not look
as ugly as __kabi_ , and should be very safe.
