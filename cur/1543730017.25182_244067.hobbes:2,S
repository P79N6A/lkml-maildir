I disagree.  Although I wouldn't expect to try and optimize the system for a 
'make -j 2048', it's important that things not suck when several users do 
'make -j 16' since that *is* a very common operation on machines like this 
(though hopefully the runtime is dominated not by compiles but by actual 
application runs).

Yep, I'm very excited about this.  It makes working with such systems to 
improve other things infinitely easier (i.e. possible).

Well, this isn't a very good benchmark for discovering things that we don't 
already know (e.g. dcache and RCU issues).  Now that things appear to be 
working however, we can start doing more realistic benchmarks.

Looks interesting.  I'll see if it works next week.
