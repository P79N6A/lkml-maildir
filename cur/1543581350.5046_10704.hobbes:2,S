Hi!
I've decided that too much trouble has been caused by a wrong PCI clock
specified to the IDE drivers (which in turn compute wrong IDE timings).
I've made the VIA and AMD drivers detect the PCI clock automatically.
Because this is a very significant change, I've upped the major release
numbers to 4 and 2.
Could anyone with these chipsets check these drivers if they detect the
PCI clock correctly on their systems?
Thanks.
Just untar the attached file into drivers/ide and recompile.
