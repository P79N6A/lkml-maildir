I agree it's a problem, but you really don't want to go kicking pages out
to disk when we have free memory - the solution is, I think, to migrate
the least-recently used pages out to the other node, not all the way to
disk. The page relocate stuff from the defrag code being proposed may help
(if they fix it not to go via swap ;-)). I'll try to find some time to
look at it again.

PS, might be possible to add a mechanism to ask kswapd to reclaim some 
cache pages without doing swapout, but I fear of messing with the delicate
balance of the universe - cache vs user.
