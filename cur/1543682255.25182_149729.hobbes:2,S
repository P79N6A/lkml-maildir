Hi kernel hackers
I have a sis7012 sound card with my new laptop SonyVaio PCG-GRT100 but
the sound is not working. I tried out with the kernel i810_audio modul,
with the OpenSounSystem, and with the alsa too, but with every driver my
sound card is not working. The modules are loaded, and i can change the
volume with aumix, but if i try to play a sound file, just the first
second gets played, and then my box gets frozen.
Please help, i really want to hear more then 1 second from a mp3 file :)
Thanks a lot
Julius
