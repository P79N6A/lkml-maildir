A friend of mine had an IBM DLTA drive attached to his HPT370
controller, and this combination proved to produce a whole lot of drive
errors (I can confirm this first hand), which went away after attaching
the drive to the main motherboard controller.
I can't say anything about data corruption though - I just asked him and
he said he didn't know of any, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.
