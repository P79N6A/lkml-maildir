Will this work against 2.6.5 without -mm6?
As an aside, I've been using SVN to manage my kernel sources.  While
I'd be thrilled to make it work, it simply doesn't seem to have the
heavy lifting capability to handle the kernel work.  I know the
rudiments of using BK.  What I'd like is some sort of HOWTO with
example of common tasks for kernel development.  Know of any?

I'm game.

Sounds good.
Cheers.
