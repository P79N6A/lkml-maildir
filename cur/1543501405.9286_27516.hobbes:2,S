   You can do this, if you want.  It would require replacing the syscalls
   *in* the libc, and not replacing them from the outside.  This is what
   happens so far.
   But this also will not work in all cases: old, statically linked
   applications will not be changed, applications might make the syscalls
   on their own without the help of the libc.
   Therefore anything like this is error-prone.
   If you want to handle something in userland then write code which is
   called by the kernel in an upcall.  This is the only reliable
   solution.  It might not be the fastest, though.
The other option is to do it as a global LD_PRELOAD, as I mentioned
earlier.
