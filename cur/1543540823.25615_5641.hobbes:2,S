Hi Guy, 
[this Reply-To setting of the tcpdump-workers list really bothers me. 
I Cc'ed linux-net for a reason. As Linux 2.4.0 should perhaps be fixed
I am sending this to linux-kernel and Alan Cox as well]

After sleeping over it I know it's not as easy to fix. Kernel 2.4.0 
has the new turbo packet support which pushes the data directly into a 
user space buffer and of course you can only trim the packet using 
the filter in this case. The turbo packet code would be pointless if 
we are not trimming the packets we receive because copying the 
whole packets if not going to improve performance...

The same applies to the turbo packet code in Linux 2.4...

That were my ideas but I missed
    3) we will not be able to use the turbo packet interface with that 
       filter code

Either that or we have to make the compile function aware of the Linux 
specifics. But as I said we will run into other problems if we are 
using the mmap packet interface which is needed at some point for atm 
and the like...
What really bothers me is that this is also my fault because I should 
have looked into this earlier. In that case we could have fixed early 2.2.x
kernels and would not have the problem now...
