Hello,
there is a USB-Device Init-Problem with the Apacer AE161 USB-Cardreader,
which contains the Chip AU6375. The Cardreader init fails in about 50%
of system boots, with the following lines:
usb 1-6: unable to read config index 0 descriptor/all
usb 1-6: can't read configurations, error -71
hub 1-0:1.0: Cannot enable port 6.  Maybe the USB cable is bad?
The patch let's the kernel stay in the loop, the cardreader is detected
properly and the loop is never executed more than two times. The second
call of usb_control_msg succeeds always. Maybe it was the developer's 
goal of the loop to fix such things?
cu,
Steffen
