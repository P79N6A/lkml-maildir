   Aw, come on...  MINOR downtime required, doable even in multiuser mode!

	For most lookup cases having monsterously large directory data
	space doesn't hurt, if all your named objects are at the BEGINNING
	of that space.  That is what you want to ensure:
	# cd /usr/users
	# mkdir .zzz
	# mv * .zzz
	# mv .zzz/* .
	# rmdir .zzz
	(This assumes you don't have extra dot-files in there, and
	 this will also qsort() those file/directory names.)

	Yes, even better; could also sort() names in directories at
	the same time..
 
	But likely the BTREE directories will do this, too.  Ted ?
