Hmmm... nowhere near as critical as the ENFILE accounting, plus the only place
we actually read it is for the sysctl file.
It could actually be dispensed with entirely, I suppose.

So:
	struct file *get_empty_kernel_filp(unsigned short flags);
which devolves to get_empty_filp() if flags == 0?

Good point.  I'll move it into the cachefiles patch.

If you wish.

Yeah... but the usage of f_flags is constrained by O_xxxx flags that are part
of the userspace interface.  Using those up for purely kernel things is a bad
idea.
Note that I've not actually increased the size of the struct file - f_mode is
a 16-bit value, hence why I chose an unsigned short.

As far as I can tell, not a lot.  I've grepped through various etc, lib and
bin directories on my FC5 system, and the only match I've found is:
	/usr/lib64/sa/sadc
I'll present the count through a separate file to make sure.
