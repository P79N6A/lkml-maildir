Other strange think is that after lots and lots of "lost interrupts" 
this work. I can mount and list files but with lots of "lost interrupts" 
and after a long time.
this is the strange.
before ls in primary master
14:          2    XT-PIC  ide0    >>> just 2 interrupts
15:       3893    XT-PIC  ide1
after ls and many "lost interrupts"
14:          2    XT-PIC  ide0    >>> just 2 interrupts
15:       3901    XT-PIC  ide1    >>> more interrupts
