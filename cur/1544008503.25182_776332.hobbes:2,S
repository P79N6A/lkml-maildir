I think it was.  The fix looks like we need it.  However:

What I don't like about this code is the magic numbers for lengths.
This patch now doubles them (and makes them even more magic by having <
n-1).  How about fixing it like this instead:
if ((int)req->data_len < 0) {
...
That way the signed comparison just works if there was a negative
overflow?
Thanks,
