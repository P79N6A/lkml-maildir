This is a good analogy, and in that general vein don't forget there
are considerable differences between different versions of SCSI as
well.  Just like there are, in many ways, bigger differences between
K&R C and C99 than between contemporary C and C++.  It should be
possible to write code that handles either one, either generically
(obviously the best) or with appropriate conditionals.
