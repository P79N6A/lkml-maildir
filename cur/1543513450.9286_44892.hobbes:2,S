Hello!
With 2.3.23pre4 my Alpha AXPpci33 locks up in certain situations. Most notably
executing 'loadkeys' triggers it immediately. But I've also triggered it
cursing around with 'mc'.
Symptoms are:
- no input accepted on any console (including serial terminals)
- no output from running processes (e.g. top)
- SysRq works, but no sync, no umount
- the process-table shows some processes in 'R' state, with a PC in 
  schedule_timeout()
- the loadkeys (or mc or ...) process is also 'R' but PC is in __down()
- one process ('sh', child of loadkeys) is 'R' with PC = <current>
gcc is 2.95
If you need more info, please ask!
Bye,
Thorsten
