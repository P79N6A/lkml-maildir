The correct figure is 112.
You need to do a:
make KCFLAGS=-fno-unit-at-a-time
build to see them all.

Not yet. The patch I posted on lkml bring us one step further.
At modpost time today we only see .init.text and .text but
with the suggested patch we will be able to see what section
a function belong to and we are several steps closer to better
error messages.
So let me get that into shape and I will revisit the messages.
In this case I would not know if calibrate_delay() should be
__cpuinit or smp_callin() should be __devinit looking at the
information modpost has available without additional digging.
But a quick grep tells me that the right fix is to annotate
calibrate_delay() with __cpuinit because is is used from
either __cpuinit annotated or __init annotated functions.
