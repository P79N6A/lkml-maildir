The sequence is in fact: suspend requested by BIOS -> suspend accepted
by kernel -> SUSPEND -> suspend rejected by apmd which is passed on by
kernel to BIOS -> REJECT=RESUME (if I understand correctly, this is
what seems to happen).
Sequence should be as in pmpolicy patch: suspend requested by BIOS ->
/sbin/powermanger decides to reject -> REJECT

Read the patch. Read the webpage:

There is no policy in kernel.
