Well, fsck has a rather restricted working environment, because it is
run before most other processes start (i.e. single-user mode).  For fsck
initiated by an admin in other runlevels the admin would need to specify
the upper limit of memory usage.  My proposal was only for the single-user
fsck at boot time.
Cheers, Andreas
