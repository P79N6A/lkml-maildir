HUH? You don't need the additional information. You need a different version
of module that would work with 2.3/2.4 (and I hope that you didn't use
loopback right before the change - it's severely fscked up as of 2.3.43).
This version of module should take the page number/offset it got, take the
lo->lo_dentry->d_inode->i_mapping, find mapping->bmap(mapping, block). That
will be the on-disk block. What additional information are you talking about?
Kernel version? lo->transfer() gets lo, it gets page->index, it gets offset
within the page. What else do you need to calculate the physical block position
(== old IV)?
