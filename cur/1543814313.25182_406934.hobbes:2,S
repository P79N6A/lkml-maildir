Errrr, guess that would me me.  Looks like a few interfaces have changed.
I'll put some time in to see whether I can get it to compile and boot.
If it's just a sata_nv issue, the easier solution is to buy a 3ware or
Areca card ... but I'll take a shot at anyway.
[Meanwhile, I still have to switch contexts and look at the long softirq
latencies that at first glance appear to be due to the use of mempool
by the RAID1 bio code.]
