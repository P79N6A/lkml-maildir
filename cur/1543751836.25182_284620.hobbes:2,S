I'd suggest (and I'm a comlete nobody in this regard) that instead Linus 
takes the security fixes + whatever he and Andrew deems to be "obviously 
correct and with zero risk of causing trouble" from the current -bk and 
turns that into 2.6.11-rc1, then let that stew for 2 or 3 days, then 
unless someone sees something horribly wrong, release it as 2.6.11 - then 
take whatever else is in current -bk and adds it and then that'll be 
2.6.11-bk1 and we move on from there.
