<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Linux Community,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>We had planned on June 1, 1999 as for release of 
the tar containing the source code for FENRIS on our website, however, we had 
forgotten that Moday May 31, 1999 is a US holiday (Memorial Day).&nbsp; As such, 
FENRIS will be available the following day in the evening.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>We apologize for the inconveniance.&nbsp; The 
FENRIS For Linux tar containing the source code for version 1.4 of NWFS for 
Linux will be available June 3, 1999 in the morning for download from <A 
href="
http://www.timpanogas.com
">www.timpanogas.com</A>.&nbsp; We will make one 
final code review pass for bugs and completeness on June 2, 1999, then the code 
will be available from our website either the evening of June 2, 1999 or the 
following morning (depending on where on planet earth you are when we publish it 
to our site).&nbsp; We also are putting in a fix for Document Solutions in 
Alabama that allows Linux to mount NetWare volumes &gt; 560 GB in size, we are 
finalizing these changes.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The license statement for this open source is in an 
attached&nbsp;source file&nbsp;for everyone's review.&nbsp; Anyone wanting to 
make changes or comments to the license needs to get this info to us NLT June 2, 
1999 before we publish the code.&nbsp; Also, anyone who feels they contributed 
that may left out should let us know so we can get your names into the first 
release as contributors.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>We will also be posting a subsequent release of the 
Open Source 1.5 in two weeks, and two weeks thereafter we will post 1.6 (around 
July 1, 1999).&nbsp; Releases will then follow as required for bug fixes and 
enhancements.&nbsp; It is anticipated at some point, we will release quarterly 
to all.&nbsp; The two interim releases for June are to integrate bug fixes and 
to put some final touches on 4 and 8 way volume mirroring, and write 
hotfixing.&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The nwfs-utils tar containing the open source code 
utilities to fsck, create, and maintain&nbsp;NetWare volume and partitions will 
be available later in the week, and will also be part of the nwfs quarterly 
releases.</FONT></DIV>
