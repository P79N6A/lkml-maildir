Ok. Thanks. Added to my patch.

Ok. done.

I did not notice that. The vma was passed to the macro but the mm
was used for locking... Amazingly it worked. Thanks...

Done.

Removed.
Thanks for all the feedback and sorry for the late response. I was busy
with other stuff and there was a deadline upon us.
Hopefully I will get V10 out soon.
