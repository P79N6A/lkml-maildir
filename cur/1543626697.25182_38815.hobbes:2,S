Ok, I investigated this a bit more using setsockopt(...,SO_ERROR,...)
After the write in the client (which is done after the server has
shutdown()'ed it), the error bit is set on the client socket
(-EPIPE).
If the client issues a second write, the write fails (correctly)
setting errno to -EPIPE.
If the client issues a read, read doesn't return an error. The 
socket error bit is still there however, even after read() returns.
If the client issues a close, close will return 0 too.
Whether the read() should return the error bit or not is
debatable, but IMHO close at least should propagate the error.
