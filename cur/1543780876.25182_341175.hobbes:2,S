Sorry, it never worked before: After accessing /dev/vbi the computer

Might be related to that it is a dual P3-600.

alevtd is outputting some debug information, which I'll capture for you.

alevtd is Debians 3.94-1

Please feel free to contact my. Turn around might by long, since the PC
with DVB is at home without internet access, which I only have at work.
