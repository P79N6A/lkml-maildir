Thanks for the pointer. I now have something useful to report.
start_kernel calls setup_arch 
 which calls paging_init
 which calls pagetable_init
 which calls setup_identity_mappings
 which calls page_address
If I put 
        asm("push %eax; movb $0x3,%al; outb %al,$0x61; popl %eax\n");
before the call to page_address, and
        asm("push %eax; movb $0x0,%al; outb %al,$0x61; popl %eax\n");
afterwards, then I get a tone after boot, suggesting that page_address
isn't returning.
I'm guessing that the problem is:
page_address calls
	spin_lock_irqsave(&pas->lock, flags);
but the spinlock isn't initialised by page_address_init 
until much later in start_kernel.
