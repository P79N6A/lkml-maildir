Subject: [PATCH] Allow lockless traversal of notifier lists
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As discussed in other thread.
Just needed an additional write barrier, so that a parallel
running lockup can never see inconsistent state. As long as there
is no unregistration or the unregistration is done using
locking or RCU in the caller they should be ok now.
This only makes a difference on non i386/x86-64 architectures.
x86 was already ok because it never reorders writes.
That's the first step for fixing all the callers. Some that 
already don't unregister or do it safely are already ok.
Also fixed up the kerneldoc description to document the various
locking restriction.
