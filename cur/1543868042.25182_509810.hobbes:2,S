Here are some more PCI patches against 2.6.20-git
They are a few additional quirks, a new sysfs file for NUMA machines,
and some documentation fixes.
All of these have been in the -mm tree for a while.
Please pull from:

The full patches will be sent to the linux-pci mailing list, if anyone
wants to see it
thanks,
