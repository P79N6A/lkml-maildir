This depends to a great deal what you mean by 2D.  The idea of a blitter or 
dedicated 2D acceleration engine is rapidly becoming history.  Several cards 
currently ship without one, and I expect to see that become the norm in future.
But if you define 2D to include things like mode setting, etc, and not any 
acceleration, then the split sortof works.
It might be better to call the components different names, like 
"configuration" and "acceleration".
