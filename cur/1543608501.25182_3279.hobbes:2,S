It's an essential feature for *many* sysadmins.  It's just so *easy* to hack
up a script to act on the information in some file - or to take a look with
"cat" to see how you RAID resync is coming along.

User-readable,  and machine-readable.   I think that covers everything. And
that's two formats.
Where's the policy ?   The only policy I see is the text-mode GUI in the
existing proc interface - and that is one place where I actually *like* the
policy as a user (sysadmin), but hate it as an application programmer.

That's the reason why I want to keep the old proc files.

You're proposing a replacement of /proc ?
My proposal was at least intended to be very simple and non-intrusive.
