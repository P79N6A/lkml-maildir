arch/ppc maps the immr area 1:1 into kernel memory, so ioremap and
physical are the same.
See arch/ppc/syslib/m8260_setup.c, line 208 (function m8260_map_io)
Here quoted:
arch/ppc/syslib/m8260_setup.c
196 /* Map the IMMR, plus anything else we can cover
197  * in that upper space according to the memory controller
198  * chip select mapping.  Grab another bunch of space
199  * below that for stuff we can't cover in the upper.

204         uint addr;
