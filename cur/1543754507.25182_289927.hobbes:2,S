I strongly recommend you switch to 2.6.5-7.139 (or later) which is the
SLES9 SP1 kernel as opposed to the SLES9 GA kernel.  The former has quite
some changes wrt. LKCD and SLES9 SP1 also comes with a updated lkcdutils.
Furthermore, this is probably more of an issue you may want to discuss 
with your contacts at SUSE/Novell rather than on the linux-ia64 list,
though if there's interest I'll be happy to post pointers to these kernel
and lkcdutils packages.
