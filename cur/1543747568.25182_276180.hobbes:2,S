there's such a feature in -RT kernels. If a user process calls:
	gettimeofday(1,1);
then the kernel turns 'atomic mode' on. To turn it off, call:
	gettimeofday(1,0);
while in atomic-mode, any non-atomic activity (scheduling) will produce
a kernel message and a SIGUSR2 sent to the offending process (once,
atomic mode has to be re-enabled again for the next message). Preemption
by a higher-prio task does not trigger a message/signal.
If you run the client under gdb you should be able to catch the SIGUSR2
signal and then you can see the offending code's backtrace via 'bt'.
