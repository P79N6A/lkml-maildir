Yes. You have a faster Disk that writes about 45 MB/s. But I am not sure I 
understand what you want to know?

I'd guess the kernel won't make much of a difference as the time is 
mostly determined by RAM and disk speeds.

Well, what do you want to find out? Anyways, I am in no way expert in the 
field of benchmarking.
Note to Willy:
I finally noticed my logic actually was not flawed. I stated why dd would 
report approximately doubled throughputs with buffering, while you argued 
why the total elapsed time would not change much.
Time to go to bed now...
