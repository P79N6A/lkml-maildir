Tong,
This is sufficient as an overview of the algorithm but not detailed enough
for it to be a discussable design doc I believe. You should ask Chris to see
what he means by this.
Some examples of your rebalancing scheme and how your invariant applies
across processor rounds would be helpful for me and possibly others as well.
