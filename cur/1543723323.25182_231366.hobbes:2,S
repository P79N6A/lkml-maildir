thanks, i appreciate the ad hominem remarks. you think we could ever
get SCHED_FIFO if we were not familiar with these calls? this is
really unnecessary...
my question wasn't about the pthread API. it was about what kernel API
was used to implement it. the simple answer would have been that we
use the TID, not the PID, or to have just pointed me at the source.

we already discovered that. the people testing this stuff are using
the most recent "stable" release of glibc, for the most part.
