It is as a big of change, but have you dismissed the "BIT(nr % 
BITS_PER_LONG)" approach?
I really think this has to be broken down into a patch-set.

Are you sure you can just delete this one?

You added and commented it out?

Why did you change x to nr? The other defines seems to use x.

Maybe you can clean up POW2 as well (or define it as "#define POW2(x) 
BIT(x)")
Also, it seems your mail-client swapped the tabs to spaces (aka not able 
to apply).
Other then what I have commented on, it looks good.
