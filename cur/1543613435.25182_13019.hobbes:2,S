d) ignore it :)
linux-hotplug should try to run modprobe on every module that matches in
the modules.pcimap table.  That way the modules can fight it out for who
really wants to control the device (I am assuming that the different
modules know about the pci revision, right?)
modules.pcimap is used to narrow the choices, not necessarily pick the
"only" choice.
