Subject: [PATCH] 2.3.3 block devices as modules don't work
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/5/19/143

The change in the block device code in 2.3.3 prevents you from being able
to use modular block devices.  The attached patch properly exports
blk_ioctl so that it can be accessed by these modules
