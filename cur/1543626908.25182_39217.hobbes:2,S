And it's not just for laptop power savings.  People putting together quiet
PCs (for dedicated sound work or just because the PC is in the bedroom)
would like to keep the disks spun down as much as possible, too.
The best I've gotten is ext2(not ext3)+noflushd+noatime+short spindown
time on the drives, plus dead crond and atd and a minimal set of
processes running.  I have a Linux box as a stereo component.
