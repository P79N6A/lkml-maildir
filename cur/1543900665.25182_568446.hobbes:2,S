Hmmm, seems I spoke a bit too soon; due to a bug in the test log
checker, the test failed but the log checker said PASS.  Actual results:
$ grep 'Final ball position' rt-tests.log | sort | uniq -c
    960 Final ball position: 0
     39 Final ball position: 1
      1 Final ball position: 2
So it failed 4% of the runs.  However, it failed much less
spectacularly; rather than overrunning the integer maximum, it only
reached 1-2.  Still a huge improvement despite not solving the problem
completely.

Ack still valid despite the above.
