thanks, applied.  I fixed this up myself to work with commit 20c2df83,
which got rid of the destructor argument to kmem_cache_create() -- you
probably want to check my tree to make sure it's OK.
Also the same as I said before about checkpatch.pl's warning:
WARNING: externs should be avoided in .c files
#337: FILE: drivers/infiniband/hw/ehca/ehca_pd.c:91:
+	extern struct kmem_cache *small_qp_cache;
please fix that up when you get a chance
