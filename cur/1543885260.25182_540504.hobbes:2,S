From my side, quite some time has been put forward to write that mail.
Inspite of that if you feel that you do have to go your own way, then it
is completely upto you. I would say: do as you feel in such a case.
In such a case are you willing to fix all the issues/requests that surface ?
Really do you want me to explain those issues in this thread ? I would
say, think over it yourself, why that huge gap occurred. Take some time
off all this, think on a cool mind.

I do have a written another mail with regards to the issues that do
prevail on the "discussions thread"

Surely there was a long mail from my side. I don't know whether you
missed that mail, but surely you should read it again.

Other than what i wrote earlier:
DST is not for just one device alone (It is really a combo driver),
AFAICS there are ~15 -20 main devices, for which there are additional 5
- 6 clone manufacturers. So eventually there are around 80 different
cards at least.
So, in fact there are a large number of cards that do exist rather than
the one card that i have sent you, some time back.
The non dst cards supported by dvb-bt8xx are just 3 or 4 cards, IIRC.

From what i know, you do need an ACK from the relevant maintainer too.
Did the concept of dvb-maintainers change without any of the DVB
developers knowing ?
