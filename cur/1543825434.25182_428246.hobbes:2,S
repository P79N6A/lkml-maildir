Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Gujin PC graphic bootloader version 1.4

 For people following the bootloading process on ia32.
 Gujin v1.4 is out, correcting all reported bugs, and still
using the 32 bit entry point of the Linux ia32 kernel.
 No big visible changes, but internally it is using more
inter-segment real mode calls so is more easily extended,
and small chages enable better functionalities, like for instance:
 - can simulate El-Torito noemul boot from CDROM _or_ HD partition,
   so that you can copy a bootable CDROM Linux distribution on a
   partition and boot from it (cat /dev/cdrom > /dev/hda8).
 - can read and boot FAT with 2048 bytes per sectors, like when
   creating a FAT16 filesystem on a CDROM (the big block size
   can be interresting for packet writing).
 - recognise FAT16 (and not only FAT12) in tiny.img so this timy.img
   can be install on a USB key to boot directly without menu.
 - can load > 64 Mbytes kernel or initrd
 - when creating a bootable CDROM in no-emulation, you can use -boot-info-table
   without screen garbage displayed and without loss of functionality.
 To install or upgrade, you should read at least the top of install.txt,
mostly if you have SATA drives.
