It's implemented inside glibc, and uses /proc to execve() the file that
the fd points to. Here's the code from
sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/fexecve.c:
fexecve (fd, argv, envp)
     int fd;
     char *const argv[];
     char *const envp[];
{
  ...
  /* We use the /proc filesystem to get the information.  If it is not
     mounted we fail.  */
  char buf[sizeof "/proc/self/fd/" + sizeof (int) * 3];
  __snprintf (buf, sizeof (buf), "/proc/self/fd/%d", fd);
  /* We do not need the return value.  */
  __execve (buf, argv, envp);
  ...
}
