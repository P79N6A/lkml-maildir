I agree, what you did is fine, great in fact.  Thanks.

A very good point, you're right.  And it's worse because I use "copying"
to mean two different things depending on context.
To clarify: in general, when I'm talking about copying, what I mean depends
on whether I'm talking about content or software programs.  For content,
copying means the act of generating a new copy of the content (copying 
mp3 files via Napster like services, for example).  For programs, which
is usually what I'm talking about, I mean the act of sitting down and 
trying to make a new program which does the same thing as the old program.
I think some people may think that I mean redistribution when I say
copying and I almost never am talking about that.
