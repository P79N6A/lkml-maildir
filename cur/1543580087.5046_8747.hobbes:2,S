folx,
i must be missing something here.  i'm not aware of a PCI bus that only
supports 70 MBps but i am probably ignorant.  this is why i was confused
by jeff's performance numbers.  33MHz 32-bit PCI busses should do around
120MB/s (just do the math 33*32/8 allowing for some overhead of PCI bus
negotiation), much greater than the numbers jeff is reporting.  66 MHz
64bit busses should do on the order of 500MB/s.
the performance numbers that jeff is reporting are not very impressive
even for the slowest PCI bus.  we're seeing 993 Mbps (124MB/s) using the
alteon acenic gig-e cards on 32-bit cards on a 66MHz bus.  i would expect
to get somewhat slower on a 33MHz bus but not catastrophically so
(certainly nothing as slow as 60MB/s or 480Mb/s).
what am i misunderstanding here?
