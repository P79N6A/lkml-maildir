That takes me back.  The classic control system is PID:
Proportional/Integral/Derivative - they refer to the way in which the error
term (output-desired output) is fed back to the input:
Proportional: the bigger the error, the more input drive
Integral: feeding back a bit of the integral of the error prevents
permanent output skew due to non-infinite forward gain.
Derivative: feeding back -(rate of change) provides damping.
You can live without I and D - the main thing is to feed back the -error.
IOW: linear works just fine :)
Your answer didn't help me understand the design though.

Isn't that mapped pages?

Need to work out what cen be removed first.  The freeswap/totalswap can go.
 That leaves us needing what?  totalram and freeram.  If the algorithm can
be flipped over to use nr_mapped, we'd be looking good.
