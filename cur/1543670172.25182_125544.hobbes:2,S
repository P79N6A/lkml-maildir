SiS driver internals haven't changed (at least not under my hands),
so it should be poking the same bits in the same registers as the
2.4 driver does. The only 'bits in wrong address' type bug outstanding
in agpgart is that the gatt_table address is potentially allocated as
a 64bit address and truncated to fit into 32bits, but that will only bite
you on a 64bit host that uses the generic gatt allocation routines.
(Namely x86-64).
