The only way that I know how to investigate these issues is
with a PCI bus analyzer.  We're in the process of going through
all of the systems we have in our lab to see which ones fail and
why, but I certainly don't have one of every failing system on
the planet. 8-)

It would be good to know the chipset on the motherboard.  As to why
the old driver worked, for 6.X.X drivers, you may have just been lucky.
For 5.X.X drivers, they perform a read after every register write to
"manually" prevent any byte-merging.  These reads are actually more
expensive than just using PIO.  Neither of these older drivers included
a test to try and catch fishy behavior.
