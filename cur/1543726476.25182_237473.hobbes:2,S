Hi,everyone:
      I have a strange problem about pty's number.
      When I telnet or rsh into my server,I get a failed with message "All
network ports in use." But when I execute "sysctl -a|grep pty",the result I
getting is "kernel.pty.nr=3D267  kernel.pty.max=3D999" (999 is my setting
value).
     Could anybody tell my why?
