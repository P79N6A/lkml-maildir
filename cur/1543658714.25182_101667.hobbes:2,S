Maybe it might be nice to update the Kconfig in sound/pci
to the following section:
   config SND_ES1938
     tristate "ESS ES1938/1946/1969 (Solo-1)"
     depends on SND && SOUND_GAMEPORT
     help
     Say 'Y' or 'M' to include support for ESS Solo-1 
     (ES1938, ES1946, ES1969) soundcard.
(sorry for lack of diff, and for whitespace changes!)
I was most confused to see Solo-1 but no support for my soundcard :)
