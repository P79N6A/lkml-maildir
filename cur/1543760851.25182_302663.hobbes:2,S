Damn, you're right. Looking more carefully at Dominik's files I can see 
that on the first pass we have:
T __sched_text_start 	PTR	0xc0420482
t __down 	PTR	0xc0420484
and on the second pass:
t __down 	PTR	0xc0420484
T __sched_text_start 	PTR	0xc0420484
I only looked at the addresses on the second pass and noticed they were 
aliased symbols and that the symbol order changed from the first pass :P

If this will just align the beginning of a section, I don't think it 
will be a problem to always align at 8 bytes even on platforms that need 
only a 4 byte alignment.
So I think that your patch should definitely go in, as it solves a real 
problem.
As for my patch it could potentially solve problems that we don't 
currently have(*), so it is probably better to wait for them to appear 
before trying to solve an non-existent problem :)
