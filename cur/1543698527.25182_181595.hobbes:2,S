Oh, I see. Now that you mention it, it does quite much make sense, I
have to admit.

That's what I thought too, but I could not figure out why.

I'm sorry for not clarifying that immediately. The entire export line
goes like this:
/home 192.168.0.0/16(sync,rw,no_root_squash,subtree_check)
So as you can see, I am indeed using no_root_squash, which is exactly
why I thought it was so strange. I did take a look at nfsd_acceptable,
and I just couldn't understand it (I understood the code, but I
couldn't understand how it could fail).
FYI, I'm currently using ReiserFS with ACL patches on this filesystem,
but before that I was using ReiserFS without ACL, and before that I
was using XFS, and these errors have been there all the time. At first
I thought the errors were because of XFS, and therefore I switched to
ReiserFS, but that didn't stop it from happening.
