perforce can export unified diffs for each changeste-equivalent right?
for the sgi ptools SCCS we use internally I wrote a simple script
that extracts this diff, the commit message automates a BK checking
with this.  This makes my job of keeping mainline in sync a lot easier
and preserves the fine granuality.  And it works nicely although the
internal tree has some additional noise in it (kdb and HSM support).

Umm, getting smaller changesets in is not such a pain :)  Linus has
stated very often that he prefers small patches that do one thing and
I 100% agree with him.  Let me suggest we heel you out to get the
current update in (and I think with your latest slave_* fixes and/or
Doug's scsi_scan.c revamp it's time to get it in now) and you send
small, self-contained patches afterwards?
