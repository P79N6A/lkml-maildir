I don't know why it's not created.
What kernel version is this?  Did you build the kernel
or is it from someone else who could have modified it?
The only failure that I see in profile setup/init is Out of Memory
if the profile buffer cannot be allocated.  Did you search thru
the boot message log for any errors?
