Although variable size boot data (such as setup data) can be reserved
via early_reserve or e820 map, they may conflict with hard-coded memory
area used by kernel. This means boot loader must know the hard-coded
memory area used by kernel.
Another possible solution is as follow:
1. Bootloader allocates memory for setup data. Just avoid the memory
area after kernel loaded address.
2. In the very early stage of kernel boot (head64.c). Copy all the setup
data to the memory area after _end. And reserve that memory area with
early_reserve (or bad_addr for old code).
In this solution, the only unsafe memory area for setup data from
bootloader is memory area after _end. And kernel can use hard coded
memory area without the risk of conflicting with setup data from
bootloader.
Do you think this solution is better?
