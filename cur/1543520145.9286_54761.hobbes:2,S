I did catch an oops. The kernel behaviour is extremely strange. I've been
working in 2.2.10-ac10, did install the fresh compiled 2.3.34 and said
"reboot". The machine did reboot and 2.3.34 did come up and all was good
until I did "cat /proc/scsi/gdth/0" when it did oops and my scsi disks died.
Then it was impossible to boot to 2.3.34 - it oopsed insmoding gdth driver
every time I did try to boot it. I did try to poweroff the machine, to boot
outta 2.2.10-ac10 to no avail... The first oops when cat'ing
/proc/scsi/gdth/0 have been accompanied with something like "Lock on CPU0"
etc.
There have been the following right before the oops itself:
kernel BUG at /tmp/build-kernel/usr/src/linux/include/asm/spinlock.h:92!
and "Segmentation fault" afterwards.
scsi_mod and sd_mod have been loaded before the gdth driver and aic7xxx was
succesfully insmoded after insmod did segfault on gdth.
This is the oops itself (looks strange with all those END_OF_CODE+ , but
there it is)...

I do hope that it does help and the gdth driver will be fixed. I can't move
to 2.3.xx until it's not :(((
I'm ready to make any necessary experiments to get it working. Please, let
me know...
