I moved the pktcdvd control files (device add/remove/map)
into /sys/class/pktcdvd/.
I only use "struct class", no need to use struct class_device,
since this /sys/class/pktcdvd represents not a real device.
The real devices are in /sys/block/pktcdvd[0-7] as created
by a "struct gendisk".
I have a little improvement request for the class code:
since the create_class() function has no attributes parameter,
i have to copy+paste the class_create() code into the module,
assign the class attribute array to the struct class and do a
class_register().
Would be nice if class_create() can be passed the class
attribute array...
The file layout is now as follows:
/sys/block/pktcdvd[0-7]/      # device dir created by gendisk
                   packet/     # pktcdvd subdir
                     <files>   # pktcdvd per device files
                     mapped_to # symlink to mapped device in /sys/block
/sys/class/pktcdvd/		# class dir for control files
                  add          # add new device mapping, creates new pktcdvd device
                  remove       # ...
                  device_map
                  packet_buffers
/debugfs/pktcdvd[0-7]/		# per device debugfs dir entry
                  info         # lot of human readable device infos, previous
                               # found in /proc/driver/pktcdvd[0-7]
Suggestions/Alteratives:
* should there be pktcdvd[0-7] subdirs in /sys/class/pktcdvd/ ?
   With content stored in /sys/block/../packet/ ? Or a symlink to it?
* the files in /sys/class/pktcdvd can be moved to /sys/module/pktcdvd/ ?!
   Seems that some modules have control files in their /sys/module directory.
