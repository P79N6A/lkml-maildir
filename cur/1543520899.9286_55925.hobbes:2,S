Hi,
that issomthing completely different, if you use e swap partition the
kernel can (more or less) rely on un your hardware.
If you use a NFS mount, it can't, because the connection may go down. In
that case the system respectivly the processes should wait ?? until the
swapfile is reconnected. 
I hope it was correct :-).
