The SIS96x SMBus is a PCI chip, so if it doesn't exist in a given
system, no code at all should be executed. So I have a hard time
believing it takes one minute. How do you know for sure that _this_
driver causing the delay? Did you actually try to rebuild without
CONFIG_I2C_SIS96X?
P.S.: The sensors list you tried to write to no more exists at this
address, see 
http://lists.lm-sensors.org/mailman/listinfo/lm-sensors
instead.
