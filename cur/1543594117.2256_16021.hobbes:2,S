I did this a while ago: I wrote userfs which allowed arbirary filesystems to be
implemented in user space.  One of these was a filesystem which allowed you to
embed scripts in symlinks, such that stdout of the script was read as the
contents of the file.
userfs has fallen into disrepair lately, but there are other projects with
similar goals.  See
