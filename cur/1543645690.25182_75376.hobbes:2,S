Subject: 2.5.40 modules don't load under RH 7.3?

Compiled UP 2.5.40 i686 yesterday, no initrd (doesn't work as of 2.5.38 or
so). Boots fine, mounts filesystems (ext3 builtin, ext2 not there at all,
else it won't mount anything... should perhaps consider ext3 first and ext2
next?). But no modules can get loaded.
Does this need new modutils (or perhaps something else?). Haven't followed
the modules discussion too closely, sorry.
