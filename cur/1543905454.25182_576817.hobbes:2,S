Since the general direction of this thread was for people to test 3D 
game performance with the shiny new CFS cpu scheduler, I would say yes, 
we do care if people with the only 2 types of gaming caliber Video cards 
can get said video cards working, right now, with said shiny new kernel.
Yes yes, I know, kernel devs don't care if they break binary drivers... 
and in principle, I agree with that philosophy.. but it's still damn 
inconvenient at times :)
