Subject: [PATCH] speedup for directory tree traversals

Dear Linus,
  Here's a patch that speeds up programs that recurse over directory
  trees, by removing redundant I/O and reducing inode cache flushing.
  Only subdirectory inodes get read, usually a very small subset of the
  ones we read now.
  The trick is to avoid reading inodes when opening a non-directory with
  O_DIRECTORY set.  It's similar to the effect of the BSD's
  `dirent->d_type' field.  Using that, you can see when you can skip
  stat()ing an entry.
  But this is better because it doesn't need a new API.  Simply try to
  open each entry using opendir().  Glibc's opendir() always sets
  O_DIRECTORY, and opendir() is specified to refuse to open
  non-directories.
  For this use it's also more effective than d_type.  Conceivably, some
  filesystem would know if a directory entry is a subdirectory or not,
  but that's all.  So it would set d_type to DT_UNKNOWN in the
  non-directory case, which the application must assume _might_ be a
  directory...
  Implementation: When looking up the last component of a path with
  O_DIRECTORY explicitly requested, set some flags in the dentry passed to
  lookup.  This is safe and keeps the VFS interface the same.  On seeing
  the flags, fs-specific lookup() may choose to return -ENOTDIR for
  non-directory lookups.  +Quirks for symlinks.
  I've implemented the fs-specifics for msdos and ext2.  vfat is hairier
  and I thought it'd tread on Alex Viro's toes.  Unfortunately the
  FILETYPE feature of ext2 is not widely deployed (I'm a bit
  disappointed), but it does work and gives a significant speedup with
  some directory structures.  I haven't measured traversing a large
  filesystem because I don't have one handy.
have a nice day,
