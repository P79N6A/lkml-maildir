There's one important point to note:
In a project of the size of the Linux kernel (at about 2000 distinct 
people contributing code within one year) you will always lose 
developers:
If you require too much from code for getting it included you lose some 
of the people who develop code.
If you accept code of dubious quality you lose some of the people who 
care about the quality of the kernel.
And if you add a stable API for modules with not GPL compatible licences 
at least one untalented kernel developer (me) might give up his work.
If your goal is to please all developers you have a goal you can't 
achieve.
The only reasonable way is to accept that whatever you do you'll lose 
some people and go in the direction you consider the right one.
And the power of open source is that when an open source project gets 
into a direction many people dislike they can simply fork it. Consider 
e.g. XFree86->X.Org or NetBSD->OpenBSD. And that's nothing bad - either 
the forks develop in different directions creating different useful 
software or there's an evolutionary contest for the best software.
