Here's a cut and past of the relevant section.  (It's really ugly.)

The "busy inodes on changed media" stuff is from the cd-rom drive.  It's 
repeated about 8 gazillion times before the suspend, and a few afterwards.
All the "new link status" messages were me coming home from the university of 
texas, with the laptop in my bag doing its "I am suspending very slowly" 
thing for 15 minutes.  It still hadn't suspended when I got home (5 minutes 
later), it finally powered off lying next to my bed as I was reading (maybe 
20 minutes from the initial suspend request).  This is not at all unusual, it 
may actually take more time with each susequent suspend attempt.  (It seems 
the swap file usage goes up as well, although I haven't examined it closely.  
This is just a vague impression.)
After I resumed, it I fiddled with the USB port to add a second ethernet 
device (ifconfig eth0 down, ifconfig eth1 up to go from built-in wireless to 
a cat 5 connection.)  The messages from pegasus.c about intr status -84 then 
continue for several pages, but don't seem to be hurting anything.  I do know 
I have to rmmod the usb stuff before I suspend or it freezes on resume 
complaining about USB.  (This was true in -test11, anyway.  Haven't tried it 
under 2.6.0.)
2.6.0 is definitely a ".0" release as far as my logs are concerned... :)
