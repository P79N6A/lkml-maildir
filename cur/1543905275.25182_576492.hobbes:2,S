Subject: cpufreq scaling appears not to work on overclocked systems

This is not new, but exists as far back as 2.6.17.  I haven't reported
it before because I figured that surely someone else had noticed it, but
since it's still unfixed and I cannot find any mention of it on LKML,
here we go.
I'm running a Core2 Duo 1.86GHz overclocked to 2.56GHz.  Everything is
normal with cpufreq scaling disabled.  With cpufreq scaling enabled in
the kernel, using any governor, /proc/cpuinfo indicates a maximum of the
rated frequency rather than the actual frequency.
Here it is under 100% utilization, with userspace governor and powernowd:

At idle it drops down to 1596.000 MHz reported.  At boot the kernel
doest report the correct frequency (2564.907), which agrees with the
bogomips reported by /proc/cpuinfo as well.
I haven't done any benchmarking to try to determine if perhaps freq
scaling works as it should and just the reported frequency is incorrect.
