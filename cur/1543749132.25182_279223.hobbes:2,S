yes, that will work. wil need to be extra-careful when one fuse is 
loopback-mounted on another.
I'm concerned that you're duplicating all the accounting done currently, 
and all of the writeback logic that is dependent on the number of dirty 
pages.
an additional concern is a fuse/non-fuse mix - how do you balance them out?
with a single accounting it happens naturally.

I'm no mmap expert. but doesn't writing to a mmaped page have to 
increase your dirty counter somehow?

I think this is a good summary.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
