Linux one?
What crash? any message ? have u see if server just crush or got a

Yuy must evaluate the network first. Check out about problem in nfs conection.
Check if u get continuos timeout or if NFs is working ok and just ina
second it crash.
Have u users on any systems with access ?

What version do u have of DU?
Some NFS versions are really sensibles (.. and a bit unstable in DU).
I had some problem with 4.0b which will be all fixed doing a upgrade to 4.0d.
DU with DU works really perfect... but had problems with DU 4.0b and Linux.
It like be solved with 4.0d as i said.
That segment of network have too traffic so it  dont like be a problem of
congestion...
Anyway i' really dont know much about kernel and Linux environments ...
i coul dhelp u with Digital .. abput config kernel, look status etc etc ...
about Linux i cannot help u so much ... anyway , i'm here if u want i
check any..
