I'll clean it up to add that stuff soon, but I've hit a problem with it on
my main desktop, it won't come out of suspend using my patch, however
vbepost in userspace works... this is very strange, as they do the same
thing  which is execute the VBIOS at c000:3, one does it in the kernel in
REAL mode and the other does it in vm86 mode from userspace.. I think it
may be calling into the real BIOS and hanging up in there.. maybe
something to do with segment register setup or stacks.. (I've tried
on-board i865, radeon and MGA cards)...
