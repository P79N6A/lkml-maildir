Subject: TIOC* int/long confusion: still a little left

Wow!  Kudos to the person who fixed a bunch of these so fast in 2.3.16!
I looked through 2.3.16 and I noticed there were some left.  These are
places where some implementations of TIOC* macros write a 'long' into
the user address space, even though most other implementations (of the
same macros) write an 'int'.  Also mgetty and every user-space program
that I have seen uses 'int'.
Attached is a list.  When I get some more free time, like in 2000,
I'll write up patches.
I know RS-232 serial on 64-bit machines is obsolete and boring, but
I have a real dislike for int/long sloppiness.  I lived through the
16/32 conversion.

drivers/char/cyclades.c: TIOCMBIS TIOCMBIC TIOCMSET
    look at the call chain: cy_ioctl -> set_modem_info -> cy_get_user.
    cy_get_user always reads a long no matter what its argument type.
    It also doesn't return -EINVAL on address space errors; instead,
    something random will happen.
drivers/char/epca.c: TIOCMGET TIOCGSOFTCAR TIOCSSOFTCAR
    More macro funnies.  Look carefully at the definitions of putUser
    and getUser.
drivers/char/esp.c: TIOCSERGWILD
    TIOCSERGWILD appears to be a meaningless ioctl in all the other drivers
    (returns 0 or not implemented), so it could either disappear or
    at least return a 0 of the same size as the others.
drivers/char/isicom.c: TIOCMBIS TIOCMBIC TIOCMSET TIOCGSOFTCAR TIOCSSOFTCAR
    cloned from cyclades.c, same cy_get_user schmutz.
drivers/char/specialix.c: TIOCMBIS TIOCMBIC TIOCMSET TIOCGSOFTCAR TIOCSSOFTCAR
    sx_set_modem_info verifies an int, then reads a long!
drivers/sbus/char/aurora.c: TIOCMGET TIOCGSOFTCAR TIOCSSOFTCAR
    just read aurora_get_modem_info.  A bunch of decoy casts lead up to
    the final put_user(result,(unsigned long *)value).
drivers/isdn/isdn_tty.c: TIOCGSOFTCAR TIOCSSOFTCAR
drivers/sbus/char/zs.c: TIOCGSOFTCAR TIOCSSOFTCAR
drivers/sgi/char/sgiserial.c: TIOCGSOFTCAR TIOCSSOFTCAR
    Dang.  All told, 8 drivers read/write these as long.  But about 15
    others read/write them as int.
