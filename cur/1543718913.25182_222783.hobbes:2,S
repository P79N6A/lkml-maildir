This is one example of a general class of problem; another example is
"Andrew integrated 15 patches into -mm5".  When you have an aggregate
work representing a conglomeration of works from several different
developers, it becomes unwieldy to apply "tags" as you're suggesting.
What if I send a patch to l-k, and Bruce forwards it on to Andrew;
meanwhile, Joe sends another patch to l-k and Peter forwards it on to
Andrew.  Andrew integrates both patches, as well as several unrelated
bits he creates himself, into -mm77, which he sends to Linus and gets
integrated.
My signature can only apply to the patch I submitted, but that
distinction has been demolished long before the patch got anywhere near
a database that might be able to record it.  If we get lucky, the patch
in the l-k archives might be recognizable in -mm77.patch and the
resultant cset.
This problem is somewhat mitigated if all "aggregators" use BK, since
BKs csets preserve the boundaries of attestation that are interesting
here.  But it's not reasonable or sane to try to filter this problem
through BK.
