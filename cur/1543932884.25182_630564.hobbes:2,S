case temp: 25°C measured near a warm harddisk by a digital thermometer.
mainboard temp: 31°C measured by lmsensors (mobo bios agrees)
cpu temp: 29-50°C (load dependent) measured by lmsensors, bios puts on two 
additional degrees.
I have 4 'big' fans installed to have a constant air stream in the case.
This really does not look like overheating. And I did have flaky ram in the 
past. The thing is, apart from the oops the system is completly, perfectly 
stable. That really does not smell like flaky hardware. At least not in my 
experience. Flaky PSU = sudden reboots, boot problems, crashes under load. 
Flaky mobo = see flaky psu. Flaky Ram: crashes, crashes, more crashes, 
segfaults here and there, especially when updating glibc, qt or kde. 
And I don't get this. I only get oopses.
It is just.. I could be the hardware - but I should have seen the 
same 'problem' with earlier kernels - and the 'almost daily oops' only 
started with 2.6.23.
