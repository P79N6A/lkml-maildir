OK, now try to read the panic output when two cpus panic at once ;-)
Been there, sworn vehemently at that ...
There's no point in logging messages if you can't read them afterwards.
I think 99.99% of such cases would not involve printk printing half
a buffered line, then dying, though I admit it's technically possible.
Of course, we could just do this buffering for the event logging half
of the subsystem if people really object. Personally, I think it's a
win to fix printk whilst we're at it, but a half-fix is always an 
option.
