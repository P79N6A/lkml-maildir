Of course not!
Even if kevent has the same speed, it still allows to handle _any_ kind
of events without any major surgery - a very tiny structure of lock and
list head and you can process your own kernel event in userspace with 
timers, signals, io events, private userspace events and others without 
races and invention of differnet hacks for different types - 
_this_ is main point.
