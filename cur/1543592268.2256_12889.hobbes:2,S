OK - now it even got worse. After just a couple hours slot5 was dead
(that was the one working just fine with the other card in
slot4). Three minutes later slot1 was dead, too. Both cards share
irq12.
Fortunately, the box wasn't frozen this time. X was up and running
fine and I was able to reboot in a sound manner.
I'll try another change in slots, but unfortunately, my nics are the
ones with the lowest traffic: one other is SCSI, the other one
firewire... (even though the latter one is hardly used).

I have to reiterate this one. Any hints are very welcome.
