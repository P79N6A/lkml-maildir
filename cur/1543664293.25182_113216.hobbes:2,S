Yep, after further investigation the problem is that the VGA console is 
configured to run with 512 characters, yet the 'old' interface code is 
trying to save/restore only 256 characters so it fails. It could be fixed 
if it was changed to save/restore 512 characters, but I don't know if 
that will break old code (it won't break mine as I always uses a 64K 
buffer to save/restore the font tables).
Can someone who is more experienced with the kernel describe how this can 
be properly patched? 
I have worked around the problem in my code by simply switching to the 
new interface (KDFONTOP), but I would like to know what kernel version 
this new interface showed up in. If it was in the 2.0 or even 2.2 kernels 
that would be fine since that goes back far enough for the support we 
need.
