I see. I remember Jens Axboe mentioning something like this with IDE.
So, in this case, you want every such chunk to check if its completed
filling up a buffer and then trigger a wakeup on that ?
But, does this also mean that in such a case combining requests beyond this
limit doesn't really help ? (Reordering requests to get contiguity would
help of course in terms of seek times, I guess, but not merging beyond this
limit)

No, I didn't forget IO failures; just that I expect the wait structure
containing the wakeup function to be embedded in a cev structure that
contains a pointer to the wait_queue_head field in the higher level
structure. The rest is for the wakeup function to interpret (it can always
access the other fields in the higher level structure - just like
list_entry() does)
Later I realized that instead of having multiple wakeup functions queued on
the low level structures wait queue, its perhaps better to just sort of
turn the cev_wait structure upside down (entry on the lower level
structure's queue should link to the parent entries instead).
