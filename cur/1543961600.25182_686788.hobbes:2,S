My apologies for not having seeing that.
But after looking at it, doesn't it still have a hole?
o  scsi_setup_command_freelist initializes the free_list list.
o  It then invokes scsi_get_host_cmd_pool, if this fails there is no
need to invoke scsi_put_host_cmd_pool (it wasn't gotten).
o  If scsi_get_host_cmd_pool succeeds but scsi_pool_alloc_command fails,
it will (correctly) invoke scsi_put_host_cmd_pool.
However, if either of scsi_get_host_cmd_pool or scsi_put_host_cmd_pool
happens to fail, we'll end up in scsi_destroy_command_freelist - and
since the free_list was initialized, the while loop will be bypassed,
but scsi_put_host_cmd_pool will be invoked an extra time. And this is
badness, right?
Wouldn't the attached patch [boot tested on my previously failing
system] be correct (and perhaps cleaner - you're not looking at the
innards of the list data structure to determine things)?

correctly initialized.
