This may be a silly point, but there *was* good 802.11g hardware available 
which worked well with the fully open drivers.  I presume the 
manufacturers are moving to the "softmac" design instead because (for 
them) it is cheaper.  However, the point is that the working designs are 
already there and it may be that buying the existing design which is being 
phased out is cheaper for the FOSS community than developing a whole new 
open device.
Maybe it would be possible to convince one of the manufacturers that it's 
worth their while producing the older design hardware - if there is a 
single manufacturer who is making more or less the only hardware that is 
guaranteed to work under Linux there is probably quite a market for them.
