hi again,
i seem to have the source to my problem here. a little application named 
"dnetc" (RC5-72 number cruncher, see 
http://www.distributed.net
) causes 
the lockups when running under 2.4.22. no joke, i too don't want to 
believe this, but it's quite reproducable.
ok, the thing is: yes, i can live without this st00pid number-cruncher, 
so my system won't crash. otoh, i wonder why this little userspace 
application crashes a whole system so badly, that it's not even able to 
give an Oops. i will try to "strace ./dnetc" or execute it in the gdb, 
but i'm pretty sure, it will crash anyway, and the system won't have 
time to show errors or even write them to the disk.
btw, the "dnetc" is some kind of "open source but please don't look into 
it" thing, and even if we manage to compile it, the produced output is 
invalid.
oh, and i still did not try to remove memory and booting with no 
"highmem" or a "not preemtible kernel" and such. will do so, if that helps.
Thanks for reading,
Christian.
