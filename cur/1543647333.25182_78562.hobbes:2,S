I said I wouldn't comment futher on the spec issue.
I know of at least one other implementation that allows any set of bits
within the link local range to be specified.  (Two if you include the
current/previous Linux behaviour :-)
Changing to restrict the allowed link local addresses doesn't _enhance_
interoperability.  Leaving it as it is/was doesn't harm anything.
