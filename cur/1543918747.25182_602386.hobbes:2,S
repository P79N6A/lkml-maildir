In addition to Trond's suggestion, you might be able to use "nm" or
something like it and see if there are references to non-LFS (f)stat
calls in your binaries. For instance, if you see references to stat()
(and not stat64()), then the app is probably not built with 64-bit file
offsets.
This is probably not as reliable as Trond's method, but it might be
less invasive and reasonable for a first pass when looking for these
sorts of apps...
