I'm currently open for constructive critics with ideas on how to fix these
things, the DRM is open for business if we can fix things up now it will
be a lot easier while I'm knee deep with time than after I'm finished and
back travelling .. should we have try to implement Linux fns in BSD, what
do we do if more parameters/info are needed from a BSD side, or do we try
and sideline all these into a separate library of functions and wrap them
on both bsd and linux?
Dave.
