The packet length is read and left shifted by two before being stored in 
that variable to convert it from 2048 byte sectors to 512 byte sectors, 
thus a value of 128 overflowed and became zero.  be32_to_cpu returns a 
32 bit value so I figured it should be stored in a 32 bit variable, not 
an 8 bit one.

Yes, I hope he can let me know if that is the case, but right now I do 
not see how that can be.  As far as I know, that value is put there by 
the utility used to format the track, and _should_ be the correct 
length, never 0.  In any case, if it is zero, then assuming the maximum 
supported size would cause errors if the actual packet size is larger 
than the maximum that the driver supports.

I also have several patches to the udftools package, one of which 
documents ( in the man page ) the previously undocumented -z packet_size 
parameter to cdrwtool, and fixes the code so that it actually works with 
values other than 32.
The upstream project for udftools on sourceforge appears to be dead.  I 
have sent email to the two original authors and had no reply, and the 
CVS repository has not been touched in over a year, and the mailing list 
is dead.  I am not sure what I should do about that, but in the mean 
time, I am maintaining ubuntu specific patches and have been speaking to 
the debian package maintainer about merging them there as well.

Why is it only 32 KB on a dvd?  What utility was used to format it like 
that?  My cd/dvd-rw drive blew out the cd laser the other day, and I got 
the replacement last night with some dvd+rw media, so I guess I will 
start playing with that soon.  From what I have read so far, dvd+rw 
media does not require pktcdvd to write to it, but its use can improve 
throughput.
