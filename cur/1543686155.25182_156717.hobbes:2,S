Good question.
My first attempt at this did claim before openning.
However that didn't work.
Some aspects of the bdev that are needed for claiming are not
initialised before it is first opened.  In particular, bd_contains,
gets set up by do_open.
Also, other code uses this order.
e.g. open_bdev_excl called blkdev_get (which calls do_open) before
bd_claim.
