I very much prefer suspend (to RAM) over hibernate (to DISK).
But once in a while, primarily when travelling, I'll use hibernate.
And the "swsusp" in the kernel is just plain crappy and slow,
which leads many people (including our beloved chief penguin, it seems)
into thinking that hibernate *has* to be too slow to be useful.
But with Suspend2, it is very quick and usable by comparism.
Try it, you'll like it (at least a little).
Cheers
