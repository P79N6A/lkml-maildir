Go ahead and become APM maintainer... APM needs some care. 
Problem is that ACPI needs driver model changes, and those affect APM
too. But noone is using APM these days, so when something breaks
there, it takes long to discover.
So even someone testing APM at regular (like every -rc and every -mm)
basis would help...
