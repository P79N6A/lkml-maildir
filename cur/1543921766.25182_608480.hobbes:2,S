Good - could you comment task_cs() with this explanation?
The rules are derived from the cpuset rules, as you explain,
and as I suspected, but now task_cs() is the most popular
way to access a tasks cpuset from code within kernel/cpuset.c,
and that's code you added.
The reason that I started this subthread is that I didn't see
any immediate evidence that the RT code was honoring this locking,
and I suspected that I clear comment over task_cs() could have
clarified that for them.
