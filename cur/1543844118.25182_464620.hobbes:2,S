No: on x86 it is the *same* case for all of these even writing an int3.
One byte or a megabyte,
You MUST ensure that every CPU executes a serializing instruction before
it hits code that was modified by another processor. Otherwise you get
CPU errata and the CPU produces results which vendors like to describe
as "undefined".
Thus you have to serialize, and if you are serializing it really doesn't
matter if you write a byte, a paragraph or a page.
