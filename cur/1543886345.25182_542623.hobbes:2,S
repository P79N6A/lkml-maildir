Oh well, pardon my obtuseness (I _really_ ought to be at least looking
around in the code before jumping in like this :-) ...
TBASE_DEFERRABLE_FLAG only {ab}uses the lowest bit of tvec_base_t *,
so clearly no pointer truncation issues here (you could still prefer
the unsigned long version for simplicity & style, though).
