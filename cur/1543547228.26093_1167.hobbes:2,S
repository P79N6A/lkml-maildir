Hear, hear.  I'm in this camp.
I think there should be one build target: "make linux" and one install
target: "make install".  If you want to get the bzImage file out of the
installed place and stick it wherever your personal peccadillo says it
should go, there will be documentation revealing where you can pick
it up.
