Thanks for the answer.  That makes a lot of sense.  When I get the time,
I'll verify that, at least for this fairly narrowly defined task of building 
a kernel.  
In order to minimize external and variable influences on the CPU load, I 
performed all these tests in console mode not connected to a network.  That 
may have been an unrealistic test, as that is not how I normally do kernel 
builds.  Having to juggle more work, like running X and KDE, could shift the 
results (2.2.18 vs 2.4.0-test12) around a bit.  I'll repeat the tests with a 
more normal work environment. If anything statistically significant is found, 
I'll mention it.  Thanks to all for their input.
Steven
