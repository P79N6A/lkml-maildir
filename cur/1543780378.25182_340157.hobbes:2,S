Hi,
I am working on a direct reclaim strategy to free up large blocks of
contiguous pages. The part I have is working fine, but I am finding a
hundreds of pages that are being used for inodes that I need to reclaim. I
tried purging the inode lists using a variation of prune_icache() but it
is not working out.
Given a struct page, that one knows is an inode, can anyone suggest the
best way to find the inode using it and free it?
