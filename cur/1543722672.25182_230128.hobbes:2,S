I've definitely not tried 2.6.7 and I'm also reading a 2.6.5 codebase.
But you can sure trigger it if you run a big workload after the big
allocation.

what you have to do is this:
1) swapoff -a (it must not fail!! it cannot fail if you run it first)
2) fill 130000K in pagecache, be very careful, not more than that, every
   mbyte matters
3) run your program and allocate 904000K!!! (not 512M!!!)
then keep using the machine until it lockups because it cannot reloate
the anonymous memory from the 900M of lowmem to the 130M of highmem.
But really I said you need >=2G to have a realistic chance of seeing it.
So don't be alarmed you cannot reproduce on a 1G box by allocating 512M
and with swap still enabled, you had none of the conditions that make it
reproducible.
I reproduced this dozen of times so I know how to reproduce it very
well (amittedly not in 2.6 because nobody crashed on this yet).
