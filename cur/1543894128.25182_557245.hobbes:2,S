Sets of statements or instructions that cannot "be used directly or
indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result"
are, for the purposes of copyright law, not software.  "A computer" is
a physical device.  It always has been a physical device, except when
"computer" referred to a person who performed computations -- and that
meaning fell out of common use 40 years ago.  Any suggestion that the
requirement to be usable on a physical device is significantly
different from "require[s] some physical support" is laughably stupid.
17 USC 102 requires that copyright protection only subsists in works
that are "fixed in any tangible medium of expression" -- which
obviously includes paper and hard drives, and has been ruled to
include volatile program memory (the 9th Circuit's holding to this
effect in MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc. is what inspired
the addition of 17 USC 117(c)).  If the set of instructions exist only
in transmission or in someone's head, they are not protected by
copyright law.
