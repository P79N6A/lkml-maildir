there's no slowdown at all when we don't need to unmap anything.  We
just need to avoid watching the pte young bit in the pagetables unless
we're about to start unmapping stuff. Most machines won't reach the
point where they need to start unmapping stuff. Watching the ptes during
normal pagecache recycling would be wasteful anyways, regardless what
chain we take to reach the pte.
