With 2.5.71, have lost second 3c509 card (i386 UP). 
From kernel boot log with 2.5.71 get
   eth%%d: 3c5x9 at 0x300, BNC port, address  00 20 af 26 bf 2c, IRQ 10.
From kernel boot log with 2.5.70 get
   eth0: 3c5x9 at 0x300, BNC port, address  00 20 af 26 bf 2c, IRQ 10.
   eth1: 3c5x9 at 0x310, 10baseT port, address  00 60 08 15 31 84, IRQ 9.
Checking on a single card system (SMP), the 
eth%%d: indication was introduced with 2.5.70-bk10.
