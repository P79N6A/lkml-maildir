No, I certainly don't. But I expect this to be handled reasonably in the
kernel.
If I understand the proposed patch correctly, it's only swepping the problem
under the carpet -- if you have one of the malfunctioning systems and
you happen to load a driver which wants to use the extended config
space, it crashes anyway.
				Have a nice fortnight
