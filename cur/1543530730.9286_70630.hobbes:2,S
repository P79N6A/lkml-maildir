If the architectures don't know of read-only data, then they MUST copy
the entire segment on fork. ESPECIALLY if "shared text" is writable. Otherwise
catastrophic security problems arise with setuid programs using "shared
libararies". The only systems I know of that do this are swap based systems that
do NOT share memory.

Banks are not required to empty the reserves. They can (at least in the US)
inform the customers that they must wait up to 48 hours (I think it's that
long) for additional cash to be transferred from the federal reserve.
Keyword is "reserve". 1929 shows what happens when banks run out of reserve...
