It had, it's just that the testing totally failed to show up the problem; that
and I think my userspace testing went wrong because I made the wrong
assumptions about what the answer should be.
However, having discussed it with Ben, HPA and David Woodhouse and others I've
come up with a patch (sent separately) that should fix it by using:
	ilog2((n) - 1) + 1 
as the basis for the calculation as this should round up the result.  I've
encapsulated this as a function called ilog2_up() and fixed the docs to make
it cleared how ilog2() and co actually work.
