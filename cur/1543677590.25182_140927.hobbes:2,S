Hi folks,
I haven't played with 2.5.x kernels for quite some time, so
maybe I missed something, but shouldn't there be a penguin
logo at boot time? AFAICT I have enabled vesa framebuffer,
fbconsole, and a 224 colors boot logo. The first few lines
are not scrolled at boot time, but Tux is gone.
On kernel 2.4.21 Tux is back.
Regards
Harri
