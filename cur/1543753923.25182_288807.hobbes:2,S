Subject: [patch 0/8] next bunch of IDE fixes (on the way to the driver-model)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
All patches are against ide-dev-2.6 tree (== incremental to 5 previous
patches).  The main part of this series is adding reference counting to
IDE device drivers (ide-scsi is a problematic one and I need some help
from SCSI people).
