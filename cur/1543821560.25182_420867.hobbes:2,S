... which is a valid frame where the stack pointer was corrupted before the exception occurred. One more printed item
(or rather, starting items at estack_end[-1]) would allow at least seeing what RIP this came from.
This actually points out another weakness of that code: if you pick up a mis-aligned stack pointer then the conditions
in both the exception and interrupt stack invocations of HANDLE_STACK() won't prevent you from accessing an item
crossing a page boundary, and hence potentially faulting. Similarly, obtaining an entirely bad stack pointer anywhere in
that code will result in a fault. I guess the stack reads should really be done using get_user() or some other code
having recovery attached.
