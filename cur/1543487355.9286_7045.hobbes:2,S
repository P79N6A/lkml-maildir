I have the same problem with other applications. After your
posting I tried netscape and it hangs as well. I already
posted a tcpdump (Subject: "local tcp stalls"). Netstat says:
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
tcp        0      0 localhost:smtp          localhost:1030          ESTABLISHED 
tcp        0  39960 localhost:1030          localhost:smtp          ESTABLISHED 
And after killing netscape:
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
tcp        0      0 localhost:smtp          localhost:1030          ESTABLISHED 
tcp        0  39961 localhost:1030          localhost:smtp          FIN_WAIT1   
You might want to try the 2.2.2-arca2 patch recently announced
on the kernel list. That patch reduced the stalls by 80% on my 
machine. Anyway, they are still there. 
I have a self written client/server to reproduce the problem.
If somebody is interested in it, I could mail it (about 4kb).
Unfortunatly it seems that only very few machines are affected
otherwise we should see much more bug reports.
ciao
