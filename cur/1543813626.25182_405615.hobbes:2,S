Subject: [PATCH] libata: fix missing classes[] initialization in ata_bus_probe()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

ata_bus_probe() didn't initialize classes[] properly with
ATA_DEV_UNKNOWN.  As ->probe_reset() is allowed to leave @classes
alone when no device is present, this results in garbage class values.
ATM, the only affected driver is ata_piix.

Jiri, thanks for reporting this.  The offending change has been there
for some time but it's the first time I see it.  Probably because my
garbage was never ATA_DEV_ATA or ATA_DEV_ATAPI.
