How about option three where we accept the problem, but when any solution is
given, stubbornly deny that it solves any problem without even trying it?
Oh, in case some of you don't get it, I'm making fun of you... You know who
you are! Hehehehe...

My opinion on devfs is, that as a lot of people refuse to accept it as the
solution, we have two options.
Either the people that oppose devfs come up with something better ("Show
us the code!")
or
We ignore this problem completely and continue with static devices and a
growingly insane device-system.
