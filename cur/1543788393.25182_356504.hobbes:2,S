Right, but a properly functioning and sufficiently fascist MAC system won't let
the user create a file in other security contexts that can be read by people
outside that context. See the recent work on supporting MLS (multi-level
security) and MCS (multi-category) in the SELinux tree...

Again, "save as" doesn't create a file the other person can read unless the
other person is authorized.

You *did* know that there's X hooks for Selinux, so that unauthorized applications
can't snarf the pixels of somebody else's window, right? ;)

Not much we can do here.  On the other hand, it certainly creates a very low
upper limit on how much info you can extract how quickly... ;)

No, that is indeed outside the kernel's area.
