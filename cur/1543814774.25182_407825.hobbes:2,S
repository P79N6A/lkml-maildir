It would be nice to uninline the function and then to modify it in a
followup patch.  That way, we get to see what changed, which is one of the
reasons to not use megamacros (sorry).

ick.  Is that really what that macros does??
The function returns a boolean, so we should short-circuit the evaluation
where possible.
static inline int expired_starving(runqueue_t *rq)
{
	int limit;
	/* Comment goes here */
	if (!rq->expired_timestamp)
		return 0;
	limit = STARVATION_LIMIT * rq->nr_running;
	/* Here too */
	if (!limit)
		return 0;
	/* And here */
	if (jiffies - rq->expired_timestamp >= limit)
		return 1;
	/* And here */
	if (rq->curr->static_prio > rq->best_expired_prio)
		return 1;
	/* And here */
	return 0;
}
This way
a) We get somewhere to put comments describing each step of the logic.
b) We get to select the order of the comparisons in decreasing
   (probability*expensiveness) order.
   See how you're performing an unneeded multiplication if
   !rq->expired_timestamp?
c) See how the first test of `limit' comes after that multiplication? 
   STARVATION_LIMIT is a constant (isn't it?) If so, we need only test
   rq->nr_running.  
d) The next guy who comes along has to update the comments ;)
