In that case, what 1.88M format are you using? The one I use uses 512
byte sectors, the same as are used by all the other floppy formats
that I use.
If we're talking about different things, then naturally out results
will differ...

Since your experiment turned out to be meaningless, so were its
results...

Curious that, wonder what you're doing wrong...

I've now triple-checked, and I found some curious results...
 1. 1.44M disk formatted as 720k with "mkdosfs /dev/fd0D720" is, as
    you state, actually formatted with 18 sectors per track, but
    only 9 of them used. However, Win95 has no problem using it as
    a 720k disk in that format.
 2. 1.2M disk formatted as 720k with "mkdosfs /dev/fd0h720" is also
    formatted as 15 sectors per track with only 9 of them used, but
    in this case, Win95 is NOT able to use the resulting disk.
 3. 1.2M disk formatted as 360k with "mkdosfs /dev/fd0d360" fails
    to format.
I therefore stand corrected regarding my belief that mke2fs and
mkdosfs were reformatting the disk completely, having been fooled by
case (1)  above, and I thus apologise for the resultant misleading
comments...
However, I do NOT apologise for the rest of my comments, which were
apparently due to the two of us talking about different things...

Isn't it a pity the two you chose are NOT for the same physical media.
The former is defined SPECIFICALLY for 3.5" floppies, the latter for
5" floppies, and whilst they behave identically on many systems, ON
SOME THEY DO NOT!!!
I have known for some considerable time that on two of my systems,
/dev/fd0h360 and /dev/fd1d360 work fine, but /dev/fd0d360 and
/dev/fd1h360 both fail, and on all the rest, all four will work quite
happily.

If they are HARDWARE-INCOMPATIBLE options like you chose, then you
prove absolutely nothing, as you succeeded in doing above...

I have to admit that was a bit of a wind-up, to see whether you were
as easily midled as you were pretending, and I'm glad to report that
you're not...
Incidentally, MS-DOS 3.10 was quite happy to use both 3.5" and 5.25" 
disks formatted to the specifications I gave above, and the MS-DOS
format command could even be told to create them, but Linux has never
(as far as I know) included support for them...
For some reason, MS-DOS 5.00 and later's format command refuses to use
that format...

There's more of a difference than that, as my experience has shown.
No, I don't know what the other differences are, but they clearly
exist...

No problem. I'm using 2.0.36 myself, having upgraded RedHat 5.1 a
while back...

As stated above, I accept that I was wrong about this, having been
misled by some curious anomolies in the way Linux does things...

As stated above, fd?d360 and fd?h360 are NOT always identical, hence
my querying your use of (to me) hardware incompatible formats...

As stated above, I was wrong here, and I apologise for it...

Fair enough, although you may find my comments earlier in this missive
of interest...
